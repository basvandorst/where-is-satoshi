Be mindful that the human brain has bugs and quirks in it. One of those quirks is that these two scenarios have *the exact same impact on your life*, but feel very different:
1. Ignorant lay person who never heard about bitcoin until this month when reading about it in a newspaper
2. Bitcoin enthusiast in 2011 / 2012 who had over a thousand bitcoins but lost them all or sold them early for small gains.
It's the same type of cognitive bias that gives people a dopamine hit when they *almost* line up the three cherries on a slot machine. It's no better than a complete miss, but for some reason a near miss feels so much stronger.

One of OP's previous threads: [What humans haven't realized yet is that quantum mechanics, and the universe, also rely on the same block chain principals that govern bitcoin.](
"All particles in the universe are simultaneously trying to solve for each other in a sort of frenzied, quantum game-theory way."
"Essentially, when the block chain of bitcoin grows large enough, and with a few additional tweaks, a new type of artificial intelligence will emerge. We are the end result proof of that inevitability. When the space chain was let grow large enough and after enough interactions, the space chain began to observe itself and begin to consider how to best change itself."
And, in response to someone claiming he was nutty,
"Another day, another PayPal hired troll trolling the bitcoin forums. Serve your masters, pathetic slave."

Sample size. of the tens of thousands of civilizations that have evolved, some interconnected, and some isolated (un-conntacted tribes, etc), any attempt at anarchy rapidly descends into some form of hierarchical system with a chieftain, or a government, and usually a bad one that involves lots of pain. Anarchy is unstable. It's a ball balanced on the peak of a mountain. The slightest bump sends it rolling into a chaotic abyss on one side or another. That assumes one can ever even get the ball to the top in the first place
Democracy on the other hand, and the blundering bureaucracy of the state that comes with it, is stable. It's a plateau, not as tall as the mountain of your idealistic anarchy maybe, but much taller than the abyss. Further more, civilizations that reach this state *can maintain it*.

Or What? I assume you are asking "how can they force us to pay taxes"?
If walmart and sears and macy's and Home Depot stopped charging sales tax, the states would march right in and shut down the store, exactly as they would if they stopped collecting cash sales tax.
If Merck and Google and Apple stopped withholding income tax on their payrolls, the government would march right in and shut them down if they don't agree to pay what is owed, exactly as they would do today with cash.

@_date: 2012-11-06 19:08:45
Um... by extension couldn't you say that If everyone decided to use cash, everyone could avoid paying taxes by reporting no income? Obviously this is not the case.
If stores accepted bitcoin, the government would force them to charge sales tax on bitocin just as they do for cash. If payrolls were paid in bitcoin, the companies would be required to withhold income tax with bitcoin the same way they do with cash.

Sure. I bought my house with about $15k down payment from bitcoin. First bought bitcoin at $32 each. Sold most of them on the way up from $100 to $1000 the first time in 2013. Realized about $30,000 in profits. Nothing compared to some people, but it allowed me to put a down payment on my house, and furnish it. Sometimes it's funny realizing I bought my $800 Fridge with 2.5 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:24:50
People that realize the bitcoin protocol is one of the *worst* of thousands of other cryptocurrency protocols out there. Literally almost all of them have improved on bitcoin in some way or another. Bitcoin's lead is built on nothing but first-mover's advantage, and in *spite* of technicals. So we are selling (correction: I already sold all of mine a long time ago) because we don't see bitcoin being worth anywhere close to it's current price.

No clue. Don't really have to have an opinion. I bought at $32 a piece. Sold between $100 and $1000 in 2013/2014. Probably won't buy back in above that, especially since there are so many more alternate blockchain technologies competing with bitcoin now-a-days then there even were when I sold.

I don't think this is a good analogy. Mining bitcoins is more like working at the U.S. mint that prints paper and makes coins. Not everyone has to do that, you simply have to trade goods or services for the currency. THAT is how you start from zero, not by mining.

According to [this]( someone else got about 155 Mh/s with a single Tesla S1070 (which is a cluster of 4 sub units?) at 800 Watts. You can plug those values into [this calculator](
To see that you could earn about $2.19 per day worth of bitcoins at the current price (left column of the results). However, if you are paying for electricity, you will break about exactly even.
Summary: This is an extremely inefficient GPU for mining. Probably not worth it. Particularly as the difficulty will continue to go up. My single, off-the-shelf HD 5850 gets twice as many MH/s and uses 1/4 the power.

It takes a week or two, but I have a verified account on Mt.Gox, the main bitcoin &lt;-&gt; USD exchange, and I fund it through my verified account on Dwolla which I in turn fund through my bank account.

I have not touched a bitcoin exchange since January. At that time, I used Mt. Gox (verified account) and Dwolla.
With this recent price jump, I wanted to sell quickly, as I was sure the price overshot a bit. I logged on to Mt. Gox and found that my account was fully functional. Transferred 6 bitcoins in, sold them at $375, put a buy order right back in at $320. Now I'm about 1 bitcoin richer thanks to timing the market and already having an account on Mt. Gox.
All of this is based on the assumption that Mt. Gox is processing bitcoin withdrawals? hopefully.

Just think about that statement for a minute. It doesn't really make sense.

It appears that we have a difference of opinion. Yours may be one like: "Any post that gets upvoted should be allowed to remain" (although this seems like rules and moderators might not be necessary...)
My opinion is "moderators should enforce certain rules, in order to craft a particular atmosphere in a subreddit, even if rule-breaking posts get upvoted"
There are lots of communities that get massive upvotes on certain types of posts, yet the moderators implement rules disallowing them. 
I don't really have anything else to say. The article is a fine article, it is against the rules of the subreddit, and you are right, it got upvoted. I don't have a personal stake in the matter. I was just trying to raise awareness to the rules in the sidebar.

This is actually not quite true. There are certain points in the game (when an excess of small cards have been dealt, leaving lots of large cards left in the deck) when the odds become slightly greater than 50/50 for the player. A good player will learn to recognize these situations, and bet significantly more during them, or even modify when they hit/stay to take advantage of them. Look up "counting cards."

Wait why do you think price is negatively correlated with mining difficulty?
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:23:08
Ok I calculate $.18 per miner per month (not bad if true!).
Using [this]( you should get $3 per month at current difficulty, down to $1 per month in just a few months if the difficulty goes up 30% increments as it has been. I'd say average over the next year, $1 per month in bitcoins mined.
That's about $0.82 per month, or $10 in the next year. So you won't break even this year. That's being pretty conservative on difficulty, and it assumes the price per bitcoin stays at $330.
EDIT: check out the [most recent reviews on these](

I'm not sure you get it. Do you understand these four statements? Do you need clarification on one of them? If you understood all four, you would know why you couldn't simply randomly distribute 11 million coins.
1) The foundation of bitcoin is the network-wide confirmation of blocks of transactions. Without it, I could send you the same coins I just spent on a sandwich. There would be no way for you to know I actually had the coins I send you.
2) it takes work to correctly craft a block of transactions that meets the "difficulty" criteria
3) That work is done by computers which are expensive to purchase and to run (they cost electricity)
4) People need to be compensated for the work they do, otherwise they won't do it.

I made the decision to purchase them when they were at $8. By the time I had money in Mt.Gox, it was at $32, and I let the frenzy of the bubble cloud my mind that it would continue to rise. I think I may have literally been the single trade at the very peak of the bubble. I should look at that some time.
I sold about half of them at $14 or so, and hung on to the rest, purchasing more at the bottom and still more during the ensuing gradual rise, and have made some good money selling bitcoins on localbitcoins.com in the mean time. 
I'm still probably down about $300 when you look at all my bitcoin activity as a whole.

You've got something a little bit wrong: ASIC hardware will *not* cause a surplus of supply. Remember, the hash difficulty automatically adjusts itself to keep the supply constant. There will *always* be ~25 BTC created every ten minutes. So the introduction of ASICs to the landscape simply adjusts the balance of who gets those bitcoins more heavily into the hands of the ASIC miners than other miners.

But if there were any answer for you, any way to make your money back with reasonable confidence, we would *all* be following it! **There isn't**
What you need to do is take $140,000 and put 50% in low risk financial instruments that keep up with inflation, and 50% in slightly higher risk/return investments (NOT BITCOIN).  When your sister is 21, transfer that money to her.
In the meantime, do whatever the hell you want with your $140,000. If you happen to make any money with it, you can pay your sister back the remainder of what you owe her over the course of the next 10 years.

What I actually did with that reddit comment is initiate a transfer from a separate wallet I have which is run through The bitcointip bot manages a bitcoin wallet for me, and I told it to send you bitcoins with the comment above. That wasn't my public key, that was your address! 
Everyone would still be able to see the transaction, as you can on the link Parallel_Postulate just posted.

I think it depends whether that smaller set of people getting new bitcoins are more or less likely to immediately sell them than the current large set of people getting new bitcoins. Either way, it will probably not be a very significant effect on the price.

In that case, bitcoin might not be a very good idea. Over the short term, it is probably very risky. Ask yourself: if you put $500 in bitcoin today, and its value halves in two weeks, how will you feel?

But, since the halving was known years in advance, basic economics says that the price already took the halving into consideration. Your assumption that the price will double based on the same level of use in the economy doesn't take that into account.

"Wrong, they are discovering already created Bitcoins." 
I've never really thought of it in that way. Can you explain how that is true? Doesn't the miner effectively put one final line at the end of the block that says "I get 25 BTC that didn't previously exist"?

Nope, there are equilibrium effects. Even if lots of people *did* shut off their miners, at the next difficulty change, the difficulty would drop dramatically, encouraging people to turn their miners on again. In reality, the people for which mining is too expensive will slowly start shutting off their miners, and the market will reach steady state (considering of course that the price of btc affects this equilibrium)

It all depends on the hash difficulty when you start mining. Look for conservative estimates (over estimates) on how many units will ship. figure the total hashrate they would all contribute, and figure the difficulty at that point. *Then* use that value to calculate your profitability.

The assumption being that people exchange dollars for bitcoins in order to buy ASICs, driving up the price on exchanges? I'm not sure that actually happens much. Don't most people use paypal or bitcoins they already have in order to buy ASICs?
@_date: 2013-02-14 05:00:18
They probably won't. One potential factor is that new bitcoins will be disproportionally mined by ASIC owners starting soon. if ASIC owners are more prone to sell than hold (compared to the current distribution of miners), it might cause an increase in supply that could push the price down.

why does a 10-fold increase in hashrate have any impact though? It shouldn't affect supply or demand at all will it? ... Hmm... unless ASIC owners will be less prone to sell than current miners, since the supply will be more concentrated in their hands.
