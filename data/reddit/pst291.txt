HOLY JESUS it worked.Oh my days this is huge

Yes this was my problem,in a closed system if you put $50 in a box regardless of how much change you use its always gonna be $50 but if money can freely flow thru then i figured a profit must be attainable. That was the mindset

Thats just "not quite" what i said

Basicly what it does (or as its untested yet what it appears to do ) is allow you to take a profit by buying initially then splitting funds into 6 or so separate groups use these funds to force an average to allow a profit on one side and a loss on the other.the profit outweighs the loss hence a profit is made and this is all done without the price of the trading pair actually moving.so if you buy in at 45 sats you sell out in the final move at 45 sats.(or 46 if you can get away with it)   
The live test is taking a while longer than it should as im being very exact with figures but the whole process should take a half hour and be ready to begin again.
