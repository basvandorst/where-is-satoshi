I bought some toys for my son's birthday from purse (pokemon toys and little big planet 3), best buy gift cards from Gyft for a ps4 and gave to the millionaire makers winner.

I just sent you an email.

You can use your discount with gift cards. It'll be pretty sweet if Target gift cards are 20% too!
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:55:14
Target Mobile employees don't get those discounts, so I'm excited to see something hopefully better than gyft's 3% discount!

From what I understand you can upload a picture of your id to remove the limits.

I'm not sure about the virtual gift cards, I don't know why it would be any different but I'm not the person that would know the answer to that. I've tried bringing up gyft/bitcoin to a team member and they didn't seem too interested. It's a bummer to see them buy things without a discount with a credit card. I use gyft instead of a redcard because I'd rather support bitcoin and sometimes when the price is greater than what I paid I can stretch my funds a little further.

I used Gyft to buy target gift cards to grab school clothes for my kids, then ordered window wash replacement line for my car and snacks for school lunches from purse.io.
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:29:20
I can understand that. The problem is I'm way too impulsive and never make lists, so when I go to the store it was pretty cool to be able to have a gift card instantly. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 20:26:25
I'm really disappointed that Gyft isn't zero confirmation anymore. I would take less of a discount and use egifter if I were to buy an Amazon gift card. I still use Gyft here and there, but I'm still a little bummed out from buying a gift card after I added up my purchases and the gift card not being ready when I got to the register. A warning would have been cool, but no. I ended up just paying a different way so I didn't have to wait in line again. I now use egifter instead when I can.

Why isn't Bitcoin a payment option?
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:36:13
I had to cancel, then reorder an item before with Dell and they send a check in the mail for your refund, not bitcoin (I emailed and called multiple times). It takes about two weeks I think from when the order was cancelled.
I wish you luck - I bought from Dell again after hellish experiences in the past because they accept bitcoin but probably won't again unless there is a good enough deal. Even then, it might not be worth it if you ever have to talk to Dell again for anything.

I signed up awhile ago but my bank isn't supported. When they do I will use this.

There's a coinbase link (coinbase.com/Crounton) in the info if you want to send a Bitcoin donation that has the address and qr code.

Orbot worked great until I updated my phone to version 5.0.1, and now I can't activate it anymore.
@_date: 2015-04-10 22:25:39
Happened to me today when ordering pizza. It freaked me out a bit because I'm used to it showing up right away. I closed and reopened the app a few times then got the email from gyft and it appeared.
@_date: 2015-09-21 00:44:29
egifter.com is another option that offers a few merchants you won't find on gyft.
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:36:54
Totally worth it!

Thank you for posting this - after seeing this yesterday I scoped out their website and decided this morning to go hit a few stores to get the trailblazer rewards and buy some bitcoin. I just got paid and usually just use coinbase or circle to buy a little bit of bitcoin. Unfortunately I was 0/3, because the places I went to don't have qpay anymore. I emailed support the addresses, and they sent me $15. Their support replied right away and they offered to send me $15 for the trailblazer rewards. Tomorrow I'm going to try to use a different location near me to get more of the $5 rewards, and will use this service as long as the transaction runs smoothly when I complete my next few buys.

Thanks for your post and comment. I just listened to this episode of the podcast and donated. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:21:57
I see that. I'll definitely mention Align to them next time I have the chance.

No root, stock 5.0.1 Verizon HTC one m8. Every time I try to start orbot (long hold) it goes back to saying "orbot is deactivated." Any ideas on what to do to get it working?

I get paid by an employer with transfer wise, because it is the cheapest way they found to send money and convert GBP to USD. I have mentioned bitcoin in the past, but honestly they haven't given it any consideration because transfer wise is simple. They have paid me before through PayPal, and the GBP to USD hurt. Until the process is simple and volatility is under control it isn't really an option.

I use gyft for whole foods &amp; target gift cards for groceries. I would like to be able to buy gas with bitcoin.

I'll put one on my car. PM sent!

Could you transfer the flash file to a computer that isn't/won't connect to the internet again? That way, you connect the questionable device to an environment that you shouldn't have to worry about.

I've gotten requests for paypal/gyft trades. Not being able to look up the users rep is why I am thinking of deleting my buy requests. I'm pretty sure PayPal/gyft was a scammer.

Mario Party 10 from Dell... Not as cool as some other posts but the pre-order comes with a $25 gift card, so I'm getting back half of what I paid towards my next purchase.

I'm still bummed out meetups stopped in my area when I was finally able to start attending!

I had about 4 btc in a wallet on my computer that I paid about $10 each for... Then the Moore, OK tornado in 2013 decided to remove all but my kitchen. I was pretty disappointed that November.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:56:28
It's a small reddit!  It was just a house... my brother was there when it happened and survived - that's all that matters.  I didn't even think about those coins until they hit 1k per coin. I was a little bummed but it's not the end of the world.  I did move away from Moore though, and now keep coins in different places so if some disappear they are not all lost!

I agree. After my son (4 at the time) started bought a game when I was on the toilet I found out how difficult it is to remove payment info from your account. Even though I work at a store that sells these subscriptions I don't think to buy one until I have to renew and end up renewing with my cc. The last time I did this my son bought skins for minecraft (now he's 5 and I'm convinced he can read more than he lets on to).

Asking to pay with bitcoin is what got me back into bitcoin. About a year ago I had a customer where I work ask me the total of his item with tax. I rang it up and told him, then he purchased a gift card with bitcoin, then let me scan his phone to complete the transaction. He then talked with me about bitcoin for a second and told me about a local meet up. Totally blew my mind and got me back into bitcoin! Even if it isn't enough to get the store interested in accepting it the people you talk to might check it out.

I used to sell Sprint/Nextel phones and had customers that bought from us because they were a NASCAR sponsor. The races really exciting events to see live (I don't watch on tv but have had a blast at races!) and they have a massive loyal following.
