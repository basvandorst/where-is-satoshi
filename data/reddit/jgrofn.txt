Because its all fun and games, until its not fun and games.  I used paypal for many years and had no problems until some scammer on ebay created a dispute and paypal sided with them despite all the evidence and seized my money.  It can be very convenient but it definitely has a down side.

You're getting happy endings at the wrong place if its not worth a $10 tip.

The draconian laws in the USA actually have quotas for banks to report people considered "suspicious" (suspicious activity reports or SARs) and can be closed down if they don't meet those quotas.

The glory of the regulatory capture of the US government is that you either submit to their draconian FINCEN regulations or masked gunmen kick down your door and drag you away to a dark hole in the name of freedom and democracy.

Its not just banks, nor is just for $5k in fiat cash.  There is no minimum threshold.  $10k is an automatic trigger.

Note the comment I replied to regarded gambling, not finance.

That's completely false.  When you place a bet and its pending, you have equity, which has tangible worth.

You have no understand of what equity is.  Hope to see you at the card table.

It is legal and common practice to buy and sell equity/insurance on a pending hand.  But even lacking that, there is equity, or expected value, in any pending wager.

The difference is the internet isn't private, wasn't built with private money, and isn't maintained with private money.  The land that the cables run over and the spectrums used to broadcast signals are publicly owned, and the public has a right to have a say in what is done with their property.  If i make demands on you because you want to run your trade caravan (or network cables) through my backyard, I'm not interfering with the "free market", I'm exercising my rights in regards to your use of my property.
The issue with Mastercard and Neteller is entirely between two private corporations, and cannot be compared with internet regulation.  I agree that there are no truly "free" markets, but there is no comparing net neutrality regulation with the interactions between private corporations.

I don't think we need drug prohibition, but unfortunately we are stuck with it because of the infinite wisdom of our government.
