No.. it won't be anonymous. It is pseudonymous. It is private. And 'anarcho-capitalists' do not really believe in a republic. They're anarchists if anything. They believe in the law of the jungle. The biggest and most violent win. That's not a world structured by law and order. I'm not contradicting myself and no, I can't teach you everything you don't know about government and economics. The Libertarian who designed it expressly calls it 'a republic'.

I think you've got a lot to learn about economics and government. But above all, I don't think you should be listening to what people think about Bitcoin and money and governments on Reddit. Bitcoin was designed by a libertarian. Libertarians are capitalists. Bitcoin is a republic, not a democracy and it is not designed to go against government regulation, or law, or to destroy governments, or banks, or society. The fact of the matter is that most of what people believe about Bitcoin is wrong. It was carefully designed to operate inside of the law and inside of existing regulation. Decentralised issuance was a tool to decentralise power. It must be neutral. That's why it's been so successful. People like to imagine that it's anarchist and/or anonymous. It isn't. It never was.

Seems to me that different people have different ends in mind. One camp wants lots of full nodes to validate transactions. This camp seems to want to take control  from the hands of business, governments and banks. Their focus is on 'lightning fast transactions between users using Bitcoin as money'. It's somehow... anti-society. It assumes that Bitcoin is a tool to 'get around' society, banks, governments and business. But... nodes which don't mine, won't make profit, so there's no incentive to run them at scale. So they won't. That is a losing strategy in a free market.

Then get your teeth into what this is really all about.
