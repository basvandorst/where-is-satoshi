If they store everything centralised then they are vulnerable to attacks. Example: transfer of funds is done on an sql database rather than on the open blockhain. 
Fortunately there are exchanges that store coins in cold storage to prevent attacks.

Turkish lira kept going down for these past 10 years and banning tech from US is going to make things harder. I think that Turks should invest some money in Bitcoin before its too late.

Agree. What's the scope of having blockchain on a centralised system...

What really worries me is that the network with the pools really looks vulnerable. I do understand the concept of pools but I don't think that was the original plan for POW and hash distribution. 
Can't the developers impose a hash limit on pools?
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:56:58
But miners are blindly mining what the pool is providing right?

Yes that's what I thought. Obviously everyone can compete and thus having low fees. For sure BTC needs to increase the block size at one point. I am not doing any propoganda for Bitcoin Cash because I respect all kinds of technology. I'm just thinking of the future.

Good luck

The problem is the cost per transaction. If you paid your friend via cash, there's no transaction costs. If you go to a restaurant and they say 15euros, you just pay 15 euros not 15 euros + transaction costs. Maybe off chain transactions (lightning Network) will remove this problem but everyone needs to be paid in the end.

I am interested to create a lightning node on my pc but first I need to setup my network correctly to ensure no one can hack my entire network.

Bitcoin should become ASIC resistance. I do understand the risks of having to create a hard fork every 6 months to adjust the hashing algorithm but Bitcoin was created to be mined by the common people and not by some rich guys... Apart from that there's the imbalance of electricity cost globally.

1 hour for 6 confirmations. I think he used a third party or something.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:34:59
That's why Bitcoin is important. It is censorship resistant. People have the right to speak. It is the basic thing in a democracy. You have the right to choose and to think about issues.

From my understanding he didn't yet launch an attack.
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:25:27
Very good news
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:59:23
I don't agree. Example: A restaurant must serve everyone and must ignore race ; An internet company must provide internet to customers ignoring their political views; An electricity company must provide electricity to customers ignoring their political views. In a democracy everyone should have equal access to basic stuff. Banning people is definitely not the way. Obviously the law should always be respected. 
Politics were, and are going to be dirty. That's why we need decentralized systems to improve democracy. 
Bitcoin is not some random code on GitHub. It's a vision that we must protect and use.

Yes. Bitcoin is the foundation of everything.

You have to generate an address for every transaction.

Yes there might be whales but in the long run they will be phased out. The more distribution of coins you have, the more people are dependent on such technology, the less the price is volatile. The fact that you are here means that you are still interested in the technology. You're just angry. I am also loosing money but I strongly believe in the ideology.

Sell to what? There's wont be any fiat coins around xD
@_date: 2018-07-15 07:18:41
It's clearly you don't have respect for technology and the developers that spent hours coding. If you want to make quick money then just go and work.
