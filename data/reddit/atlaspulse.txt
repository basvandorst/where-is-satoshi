This new index, the CC10, measures the live value of 99% of the Crypto market. It has enormous potential.

China would matter less if the order books on the exchanges had more depth. That would also reduce volatility and increase adoption. More long-term confidence of crypto viability will help.

Cause and effect. Difficulty follows price. It's a lagging indicator. Same is true in gold.

Yes, I’m the founder. That’s no secret nor is it a revelation.

If that were true, velocity would be constant. It isn't. It contracts into strong price action.

Because the coins have no previous address

Thank you. I read your piece, it was excellent. Halvening leads to price stability (lower volatility) not price appreciation. SF important in the early days, as you say. But the impact of the SF model is actually halvening - not the price doubling.

You might be right. 1 in a million or so. But probably wrong.

102% of coins mined have been sold over past 12 weeks. Possible because over time, miners have built inventory. They have been reducing that for much of this year.

high number of small tx - not just speculative traffic

If the 60% of HOLDers wanted to sell, they'd be bought by others that wanted to own BTC for different reasons. It takes two to make a market. If the buyers were productive, and the market was healthy, the price would remain strong. If it was a get out now situation, the price would collapse. Obviously this would need to take place over a reasonable time period.  
I do not see BTC as a currency. I wrote that in the piece. It is an asset.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:27:40
was taking your point on 60% selling at the same time. Although you did say moving not selling. Apologies. Moving, if productive, would see the price rise, not fall. That' s because it would reflect a strong economy, and there would be high demnd from the outside world which would coincide. Obviuosly wallet shifting would be unproductive, and presumably be neither bullish nor bearish.

SF = 1/inflation. Same thing. Low inflation brings confidence and stability to the supply side. This is the most useful observation about SF.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:29:15
well put. SF leads to price stability not price appreciation.

Price slipping today.

Indirectly as lightening reports to the blockchain but doesn’t measure quality. Can’t be sure how lightening influences price. Spread betting and futures etc will impact liquidity, but will have less impact on price. Lightening impact unknown at this point. Hopeful to assume off chain can carry the chain.

You'd squeeze the market, that's for sure. But if you bought every single bitcoin, you'd loose everything as you'd kill the network in the process - they'd be no one to trade with! $20bn god for it. $200bn maybe too much.

12 week velocity lowest since mid 2014. Current reading 464%. Healthy market above 600%. Average closer to 800%. Low readings in 14 and 18 were followed by 50% falls. Needs to pick up soon.

Single tx. Hover over the square on the site and you'll see the breakdown.
@_date: 2019-10-14 18:56:21
sorry should have said!

Need a desktop. Point mouse on the yellow square. It says one tx.

not much interest in this despite the $500 price move that followed.
