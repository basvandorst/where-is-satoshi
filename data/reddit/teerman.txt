How is this supposed to work? Regulating the exchanges?

It can be copied but only with the permission of the database owner who could limit access for the purposes of replication. You also have the issue of how many replicas you need to make the data persistent to a high enough degree. A block chain wouldn't have this issue as it is by nature public, immutable and highly persistent. 
Agreed though that a blockchain is over kill for most applications.

When I say blockchain i am referring to the ethereum blockchain.

I find myself thinking this with most blockchain based applications, it seems to be a solution looking for a problem. I guess in this case the blockchain gives a degree of transparency that a centralized database would not.

What exactly is network spam in this case, lots of transfers with low fees to wallets owned by the same person?

A database can also just be turned off by its owner, data on the blockchain is persistent and publically available as long as a copy of the blockchain exists.
