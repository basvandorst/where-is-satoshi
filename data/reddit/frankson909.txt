In Europe it’s coinbase for most of the people - u will read a lot of annoying comments about their support, bit I never had an issue...

price went high: 0,5 BTC = 5000$?
@_date: 2018-09-10 19:58:41
...sold at 7000 but it kept going... ��
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:46:11
it was a joke ;-)
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:35:26
it’s now worth around 70$ - but I think nobody will buy it for that money

yes I know, cards cards cards in the US. But we have a difference over here:
I remember like ten years ago it wasn’t easy for me to get a credit card. That was more like the holy cow for business people and all were scared because you have to pay it back at the end - totally different than just spending your plus from the normal account - if this is gone you know you’re finished.
Even having more than one Credit Card is not the standard in Germany

why? you can choose it!

So I did some research too:
Yes we have a limit for anonymous payments above 10.000€ in Germany. Every payment which exceeds the limit one has to show his ID.
500€ Note is going to disappear end of 2018
All the governments trying to get rid of paper money. I can tell you from my work that especially people from sweden for example are paying 90% with their card - even 3€ for a coffee...
Until it still exists I’m using cash all the time when possible because I don’t like them to see on what I’m spending my money...

10.000€ in germany too - as far as I know

what does that mean? How my mom is hitting 2500? 2500 what?!

In my opinion don’t put gun owners onto the btc blockchain, but throw every gun in the world to the rubbish bin! As a european I will never understand what is so wonderful in the freedom to own a gun... Which country has the most gun accidents, kills, amoks...? Feel free to downvote ��

I’m going for the 5000 - keep them until BTC is down to 2500, then I’m going to buy 2 BTC.

It looks more like the binance app...
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:36:53
looks shopped

In the Euro Area it’s safe to buy from coinbase. As told before, don’t leave them there. Get a wallet, cold storage, ledger or something - not your keys, not your money!

I don’t know

In for the tech.

Burger King Germany is NOT accepting BTC. I mean you can not walk into a shop and buy via BTC. There is a delivery service, Lieferando, through this service you can use BTC - but only on their website and not in their app.... No huge adoption, the service offering this since a long time
