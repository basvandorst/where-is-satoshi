The biggest problem is governance, both sides are jostling for control of the protocol and disguising it under a block size debate. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:41:28
I think he is just having fun, Bitcoin needs more of this.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:10:06
That's where I see it going, traders have realised it will peak again so we wont' go as low a the last bear trend.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:30:13
hyperbole engaged
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:00:48
So purely political reasons...Oh and just because you say it's so doesn't make it happen.
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:22:24
And massive buy orders, the price rose as we approached the deadline..
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:03:39
If, whats and buts. It doesn't have double the support at the moment so stop make future predictions with your crystal ball....This subreddit has been flooded today with this nonsense, you are either part of it or encouraging it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:13:24
He's trolling to an extent, both subreddits can be toxic. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:25:44
The voting sytem is so open to abuse, it's a circle jerk for different agendas.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:57:26
You say above miners have absolute control currently and then say they wont have with the new proposal either, which is it? Whichever way you look at it the change gives miners more influence over the block size, that may not be critical now however it could be in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:03:33
They don't have absolute control. There is a 1mb size limit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:05:35
If Segwit and lightning would work wonderfully in a BU unlimited majority client, why not in a core client? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:00:15
He is thinking about the long game and the tx fees.
@_date: 2017-04-05 07:36:48
A wide belief in your mind. I've read the other thread about 75% signature discount and there is nothing there to substantiate your view or claims. It's your opinion, that is all.
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:26:44
His videos and viewpoints are still extremely interesting, maybe your point of view has changed since 2015..
@_date: 2017-04-06 10:03:33
Exactly, the damage this will do to their business is another matter. If it's true...
@_date: 2017-04-09 19:11:38
Lol, redditor for 0 hours
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:59:02
Everyone is a Bitcoin and trading expert on reddit.
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:51:16
Thanks, thought as much
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:29:58
I'm glad I bought it when people like you told me it was dead two years ago. They have managed to get agreement with the miners, Bitcoin can learn from that at least.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:32:26
I really don't understand how someone with no coding knowledge is seen as the figure head for BU.
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:03:53
This man knows
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:11:46
I've read complexity of code is a perceived concern of some, I'm not saying it is. Would you clarify your last sentence, it doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:17:49
100 Bajillion dollars
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:35:02
One of the main concerns has been complexity of code, Litecoin devs have stated that they are not concerned and I presume the implementation will help to allay fears.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:08:13
Well you haven't, everything agreed in that meeting had been proposed previously by the Litecoin devs. Only an idiot who hadn't done their homework would think otherwise and go on the rant that you did without fully understanding the facts. 
The reason Bitcoin consensus keeps faltering is because of people like you who just want to see continued hostility as opposed to an agreement which suits all parties.
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:23:31
That highway can be shared with other coins., I can think of one that needs a few extra lanes.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:23:53
What you mean they agreed to increase the block size if so required, something that was already agreed upon.....you obviously didn't do your homework
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:52:12
He just ignored that fact and added his own take on it- Alternate facts :)
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:59:34
This proposal makes the most sense to me.
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:01:30
Serious question, if one were to travel to Japan and cash out their Bitcoin, would you still be liable to pay tax in your country of origin. I think I know the answer :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:33:03
If they wanted a level playing field they wouldn't be against it being blocked. It's as simple as that.
@_date: 2017-04-09 19:58:02
yeah, like there is no difference between 0 hours and 2 months
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:24:53
Who said I was bag holding :) You sound like you don't even like crypto
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:10:38
You are delusional, a group agreed on a way forward. Somehow you are morphing that into a government!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:32:31
An average of 75% during the two week period. I have no doubt there will still be a couple of twists and turns and someone will attack that hashrate to make money, that could happen on the positive side too.
@_date: 2017-04-05 07:59:57
There is, you don't accept it. That is something entirely different.
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:45:10
I was merely pointing it that's it's your opinion, rather than fact.
Segwit discount provides an incentive for users to upgrade to an optimised transaction scheme.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:40:35
Any exchange that does not approve verification submission within a month is not worth my trust, withdrawing funds is painful and deliberately slow. This is the biggest warning sign to me...
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:11:38
I'm all for on ramps, however they are taking 8%. It's worse than what a bank charges to transfer money.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:35:29
Doesn't this kind of contradict the whole point of crypto?
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:43:33
Down voted for complaining about totally unreasonable wait times for verification?  Maybe someone from Polo could explain why this process is broken?? It's almost as if there are shills in this thread....
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:46:28
Bitcoin trending at almost the same levels as 2013. Sell
@_date: 2017-05-01 10:59:30
Her inflections made me nauseous, hey ho more the merrier
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:10:11
I'm talking about the 8%. It's more than a bank takes.....
