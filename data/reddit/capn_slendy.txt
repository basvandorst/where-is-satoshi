Seriously, there isn't any information on how to mine namecoin by itself.

Can anyone modify this to work in firefox? Most of the javascript should carry over. I would do it myself, but I don't know enough about firefox's javascript engine.

Yep, more mainstream users.
The discussion on Theory of Reddit  basically came to the conclusion that at around 20k subscribers, most subs boiled down to:
1.Post funny/emotionally-loaded/Meme content that is mildly/distantly related to the original intent of the sub.
2. ???
3. Karma
At that point some members that feel the sub has strayed to far will create a "true" sub  or something similar.

What other currency system gives you the ability to track where any of the currency goes at all times? If address registration and "validated" coins become the norm, it could be much easier to track who is spending which coins.

I don't know what to say :,) Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:11:59
Right, that's what worries me. If address registration or colored(tainted, marked, validated) coins become the norm, I feel like a large portion of the community would drop bitcoin like a rock. I think those ideas need to be opposed vehemently before they gain any traction.

But the implications of this are that after bitcoin is adopted, that it will be regulated like or even more stringently than current bank transactions,  that control of the market and exchanges would become much more centralized, and that it will likely lose most of what made favorable over fiat currency and big banks in the first place.

Don't forget to put the wallet within a hidden, encrypted volume within an an encrypted dummy volume. That way if someone forces you to give them the password for it, you give them the password to the dummy volume, and they are none the wiser.

Yes you can?
    &lt;a href="bitcoin:1J2HK1NmnBS7TdvqrcbcfGzE66bmHARwPx"&gt;Just like this&lt;/a&gt;
I know this is supported at least in bitcoin-qt and litecoin-qt has the same functionality.
[Here is the relevant info](
EDIT: You meant iOS can't do that, not that the functionality for bitcoin links didn't exist. Sorry. At least some more people can read about bitcoin links now.

Seems like a crock of shit, all the linked didn't seem particularly useful. And the linked bitcointalk post didn't go anywhere. Even if Bitcoin was funded and rolled out by DARPA or DARPA-related entities, the couldn't have much direct control over the protocol other than trying to leverage the market or large orginizations like the Bitcoin foundation.
