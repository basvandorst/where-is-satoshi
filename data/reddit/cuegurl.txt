It's down again after being up for only 6-ish or so hours.

So I guess, once they're hacked, it's over. You lose everything. That's rather unsettling...

Probably hack success.

To be honest, I am almost thinking that they're running off with all the BTC

How can they be down for this long? This is incredibly unprofessional, will remove my assets as soon as they're up again.

Any idea what the legal implications there are for being hacked?
If a bank gets robbed, it's THEIR loss and they can't just go "Sorry, you got robbed.", how would an exchange handle that? Could they even repay if they got hacked?

Thank you very much, I really appreciate and am really really glad there are people who understand that life is not always smooth sailing....

Aww. Now I almost feel bad for assuming the worst. 
I'm glad everything is fine, though.  Your websfrontend has some decent security measures, I'll be trusting that your backend does too.
Can I ask something, though? What would happen if you do get hacked one day and lose everybody's money. Do you have some kind of insurance? I believe it is imperative that exchanges do have some sort of insurance policy. Especially since there is no government behind Bitcoin thus nobody would bail exchanges out, like they would with banks.
