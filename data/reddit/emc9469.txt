Butterfly Labs Jalapeno (around $320 at the time) 8GHz of hashing greatness.  I will turn it back on if I'm forced to, be warned.

Wife and I use Bitcoin to settle bets when playing Shut The Box.  Buying health for small fee as we don't have to exchange that dirty dirty paper money.

I'm going to continue using breadwallet.   If there is a fork will evaluate what is happening before creating a transaction in any wallet.  You can always move private keys to a new wallet if they don't handle the fork to your liking.

Just to clarify, it's not 2 weeks that bitcoin adjusts difficulty, it's every 2016 blocks.  Which comes to 2 weeks at 10 minutes.  If it takes 20 minutes per block it could be up to 4 weeks or more before adjustment.

I think you are missing something.  Think of it like this. I send you a bitcoin transaction for $1, it's completely valid and you can push it to the network at anytime you want.  But I've indicated to you that if you hang onto that I'll send you another one for $2 that invalidates that first one.  For whatever reason we agree on, watching a video, a tip, paying for coffee.
Another way to look at it is like the old gold standard.   I give you a $10 bill, (off chain) it's not real gold until you goto the bank, but it's verifiably as good as gold.  At some point in the future I give you a $20 bill that invalidates that $10.
You or I are both free to end this relationship (channel) and exchange for gold at the bank at anytime.   It's gold standard 2.0 because nobody block or decide these transactions are no longer backed by Bitcoin because of maths.

I like the idea but how do you know if the payment is correct?  If the beer is $5 is it ok if i send $4.50? what about $4.95?  The conversion value in my wallet may not be the same as the one in your point of sale system.
Think BIP21 - URI Scheme is what you want to look at and propose extension to.

Multiple miners could collude and put bitcoin into a spam pool based on their relative hash power.  They would all get a percentage of this investment back on their mined blocks + higher fees all around.  If they were a majority would probably be worth the cost.  I'm saying this after doing absolutely zero calculations.

Nothing about that seems frightening to me.  I don't think I fully understand the technical details or why you care what people are doing with their money.  It's my understanding this is an  open source protocol.  Great thing is you don't have to use it if your not comfortable.

Dear MSM,
Please stop writing articles about the price of Bitcoin.  We know when it goes up and we know when it goes down.  We know how much it went down.  We know this before you do.  Your article is worthless after a few minute of being published.

I agree it's not fud but it is a wallet issue.  There are many cases where I'm fine with a 2, 3 or even 7+ day settlement.  I have no choice but to drive up your fees because I can't reduce mine.  I've just now heard of Green Wallet but kinda suspect that there are multiple publishers in the ios store and not a lot of reviews.  I'm open to other iOS options to do my part to reduce fees.

Why do people use localbitcoins and pay a premium?  They don't want to identify themselves to an exchange is one reason.  You don't need social security # and checking account to make an Amazon order.  Plus you can use paypal, credit card or any payment to make the order.
Your Grandma gives you $500 Amazon card you want $500 worth of things or $400 worth of Bitcoin?  There are reasons someone would pay a premium vs using an exchange.

Bitcoin has value because...fuck banks. Fuck your bank if you want fuck.

Hard to say, never is a mighty long time, I'm here to tell you.  I would say any transaction, even 0 fee, has a chance of being confirmed in some time frame that is less than never.
You would need to look into how various clients/miners handle mempool expiration.  Also depends if your wallet is re-transmitting the tx periodically.
There is also a "child pays for parent" method.  If another transaction is dependent on your transaction confirming in theory someone can create one that pays for yours.  Miner would include yours to get the fee from theirs.

Regardless if Segwit is the solution how can you blame a group of developer(s) that maintain an open source project for anything?  Do they owe you something?
Some don't believe in an on chain hard fork increase, whatever their reasons, so they aren't going to do it or push for it.  Pretty straight forward to me.   Either you have to do it, pay someone to do it, or convince someone else to do it for you for free.   Seems like r/btc is using blaming and playing victim as their way of convincing change.  Either their tech and ideas are shit or they like playing victim.
