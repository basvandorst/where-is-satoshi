is the point of this sub to promote bitcoin adoption? thats what it seems like sometimes...
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:16:50
more importantly, why would you want to read the Guardian?
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:22:30
it's pretty clear that it means compared to older generations imo. not saying the article's good or anything tho.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:15:30
Yeah, running out of alcohol sucks, but you shouldn't be too hard on yourself.
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:47:57
But why is it good for our economy? And how is it easy? Is this sarcasm?
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:59:09
this is OnLy oNe IMPorTanT ThIng that MAKE DIffeRence Between WalLets !! 
Sorry but I'm finding it hard to take your post seriously with that many grammar mistakes.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:02:16
Exactly lol. The title is misleading and makes it sound like some professional fukin economy dude thinks that banks are actually going to buy bitcoins. Actual quote is:
 "Last December veteran economist and CEO of Blockchain Peter Smith said that central banks will begin holding digital funds as part of their balance sheet in 2018.".

99% of people can barely remember their facebook logins, doubt the majority are going to remember how to manage their own bitcoin wallet :P
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:16:27
On a side note, biometrics are definitely improving recently, and could be a possible solution to keeping a secure wallet. But it obviously wouldn't work well for criminals due to the lack of anonymity...
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:14:50
It's not just the bad grammar, but how the message seems very exaggurated
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:55:03
Cryptocurrencies made stock market gains look insignificant!

When the next global financial crash happens, people's retirement funds will too.
I don't trust that my retirement fund will still be there in 30-40 years. A lot of shit is gonna happen in those years.
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:58:11
it's technically true globally, look it up :P
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:17:13
Inaccurate pic. If it was really adding an 0 then it would be worth 00000 now, and that doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:47:55
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:55:22
Oh ok, that makes sense I guess.
There could still be an issue if a single entity owned like 5%+ of the entire wealth of bitcoins though.
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:44:00
exactly, early adopters would just be the new oligarch
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:54:19
so like 90% of people on this sub then :P
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:55:57
Yea sure...
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:23:38
america wants people to stop sending money overseas so the system based on ripping off other countries won't fail.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:06:49
I agree with him about the sub tho tbh :D
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:56:49
Good, people should be paying their taxes lul, it's the law (preparing for the horde of downvotes)
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:00:04
It might be because total amount of debt doesn't really mean anything. If two countries owe each other $500b in unpaid bills, the net debt between them is $0. One of the countries might take longer to pay it back than the other, but you can't really tell from just the number. Another country might refuse to pay it back, what happens then? (surely bad things)
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:58:58
This is pretty fucked up. If bitcoin did magically become the world's standard currency then people who own 1million+ bitcoins would have more wealth than most rich countries.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:04:51
A lot of loans are not a choice though, e.g. student loans / houses. It's ingrained into society to take out loans for certain things. The high cost of these things forces people to go into debt for a long time.
@_date: 2018-04-12 09:12:28
fuck bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:58:56
couldn't this be done for any other poor country as well?
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:02:07
I think you're failing to see his point. Gold is yours to keep as well, but it doesn't stop banks from representing gold in numbers on a screen.
