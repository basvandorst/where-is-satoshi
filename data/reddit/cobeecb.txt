Cypherpunks write code. Adam Back writes tweets.

Exactly. There needs to be incentive, a discount, to get people to switch from 16 digit private keys.

This woman is the personification of "fake news." She says she invested in infrastructure companies and shifted to investing in bitcoin companies in 2013. Which companies did she invest in? Is she on the board of any of these companies? Or was she a PowerPoint monkey (aka Associate)?
She tries to market her personal brand of "women in tech" on her [website]( I'm all for women in tech but the two foundations she's "executive director" of were both founded by her and has no other employees. They literally do nothing. 
Her current ["VC website"]( is more of the same. I haven't seen so much bra stuffing in digital form in my life. It's literally a web of nothingness.

purse.io supports US, CA, etc without making you buy corporate fiat
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:33:03
This is cool but can you save any money like Purse.io? If not, why wouldn't you just sell btc for Fiat?

I've bought bitcoin on Purse recently and did not have a problem. Their support was nice and informative. Having only tried Coinbase, Purse was far easier to buy bitcoin IMO but I'm new to this. Still not at a whole bitcoin yet :/

New user here. For the longest time, I thought I had to buy a whole bitcoin.

Also, what's Btc is short for Bitcoin or is it something different?

How does one control a decentralized currency? Asking for my government...
