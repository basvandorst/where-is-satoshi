Actually NXT already surpassed Bitcoins liquidity within 2 months of it's existence :)
Sorry, but the future has arrived.

You don't "earn" things through mining, you waste resources. Bitcoin is responsible for 0.03% of all climate emissions on this planet already. 
And it's not like your "average man" will mine any Bitcoin, the big mining farms get all of those, you have to invest way more money to mine Bitcoin than to forge NXT.
NXT was open for 2 months to ANYONE who wanted in. It could've bene 5 guys or 50000000 guys. Market decided.
NXT already got better distribution than Bitcoin. 
It's time people wake up and realize that mining is oldschool and detrimental to the environment and a complete waste of time and resources.
Plus Bitcoin and most altcoin suffer from the 51% attack. NXT don't even suffer 99% attack.

Because it's primitive?
You still have to use centralized exchanges like Mt Gox and Silkroad to trade with it.
We have seen time and again why this is very, very bad.
Cryptocurrency is now entering it's second generation with NXT and other 2.0s which have built in decentralized exchanges where you can trade cryptos, assets, whatever without ever involving a third party. Plus it's 100% anonymous unlike Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is basically just a very cumbersome way to POTENTIALLY save a little cash on not having to pay fees but due to the volatility you'd have to be insane to put your money into Bitcoin to USE it
