This is not a good idea, it's just postponing the inevitable. Bitcoin is different to the currencies people are used to. Instead of endlessly inventing new terms for fractions of a btc, people should wrap their heads around the idea that a deflationary currency with a finite supply needs to be divisible the same way that their inflationary pounds or dollars or euros are necessarily worth less year after year.

Bitcoin as a technology is still the preserve of the technologically progressive, a demographic that correlates with disposable income. Nobody's going broke as the result of a Black Friday sale. It circulates currency. People will spend money and buy things. With more of a push in favour of Bitcoin-accepting retailers, Bitcoin will have more share of a pie that will be baked with or without it. If you want Bitcoin to succeed, you must be agnostic about the transactions it's used for: the most successful currencies are used both above and under the table.

The existence of a deterrent IS a form of protection. Something doesn't have to be 100% effective to be a protection. Credit card companies choose what jurisdictions to operate in based on where they can turn a profit, which is largely driven by the laws of that jurisdiction. I didn't posit that PCI-DSS was a direct result of American federal law, but if identity theft was not a crime in your country the credit card issuers would probably not operate there.

Uh. Actually the law provides statistical protection: it reduces the number of identity thieves to that proportion of the population who are criminally inclined and organized enough to attempt it. It also mandates things like PCI-DSS. 
Essentially it's like herd immunity: if a sufficient percentage of the population are vaccinated the chance of any single person becoming ill is reduced whether they themselves are vaccinated or not.

Independent businesses are more likely to be run for the sake of continued business, whereas VC-backed startups are more likely to have been started with cashing out as the main objective. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 01:15:08
What differentiates Google and Snapchat from the field is - wait for it - owners dedicated to building their businesses who had to accept VC as the lesser of two evils. Snapchat would have folded because they couldn't afford their server bills. Page and Brin wanted to retain ownership of Google rather than going public. 
Both are culturally very much in the former bracket. They were examples of engaged business owners who were trying to build something, rather than fatten up a cash cow to sell. I'll admit I was hasty with my "name one" challenge, but even you should be prepared to admit that the vast majority of startups are created to be sold: the company is the primary product for sale.

There's a lot of room between making a profit and making a bigger profit, and that's where should comes into play. Breaking even is an imperative: they *must* break even in order to stay in business. Must admits of no alternative. They *should* improve efficiency and customer satisfaction, but there are plenty of companies with a dominant market share that discharge their obligation to their shareholders by cutting costs and to hell with the customers. 
There's no must with the shareholders. The company should make them a profit, but if they don't then the shareholders should unload their shares. Again no must without specific conditions: they should unload poorly-performing shares, they must buy better-performing stock if they want to make a bigger dividend than they would with their previous investment.
A should should be qualified, but a must must be.

That's erring on the philosophical side. Most people are used to inflationary currency which they peg to real-world items, whether it's a pint of milk, a gallon of gasoline/petrol or whatever. At the consumer level the value of goods fluctuates more than the value of the currency they use to buy those goods, and the currency is finitely divisible.
