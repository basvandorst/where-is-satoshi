*CORRECTION: You hate the Bitcoin market.
You can only blame yourself for selling off your coins at a very low, non-profitable price without waiting longer.

I stop around 70-ish and up. One of my payouts was $0.13, so I was using it as a reference. If you keep going the system will sorta hault your payment and let your uBTC keep going.
I didn't make it though, so I don't know the exact details.
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:53:53
It definitely wouldn't be too high, given the way the prices have been going up and down this year, and that 2020 is only 6 years away.
I think 1 BTC would be worth around *$15,500~$16,000* in USD by 2020. Then again, it all really depends on how bitcoin community grows - the more investors, miners, and enthusiasts the higher the price.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:52:16
I spent no money at all to make this $1. Just days of visiting websites and having generous people sending me pocket change with the changetip system.

That's why I mentioned the [other one.](
It's hosted on your side, it simply gets conversion rates from blockchain.info and then charges it to the user and you receive the BTC amount to your wallet.

They pay every 60 uBTC you collect, and I usually stop around 70-ish uBTC so I get about $0.13 for free every session I do.
Some have complained its slow but in my case, I've gotten payments within about 2 minutes with instan confirmations.
@_date: 2014-08-23 06:35:54
Is there really any argument here though? I'm no expert, but for *customer covenience* companies accept payment in other currencies and turn it into their main currency.
E.g: a Japanese tech company of course operates and deals in Yen [¥]. However, they have established a global customer base, and offer to accept USD[$] and Euro[€] and at the end if the day, they convert it back into Yen because their company is in Japan, therefor it operates in the national currency there. Bitcoin is just another currency, the problem comes in when you realize it isn't specific to one country/continent.
This is why a lot of hot-headed people go to claim it as property. Inadimate objects are what you treat them as, this includes both PHYSICAL currency and DIGITAL. If a store/business operating in the US is accepting BTC, of course they convert it to USD. They do this, while their conversions *help* BTC grow. If all businesses and officials recognized BTC, there'd be no need to convert it. Until there is a nation that makes BTC its official currency, it is going to be obvious people convert earned BTC to their nation's currency. Unless you're a BTC only business, that is that manages to operate and deal solely on BTC alone.
Basically, in the end they're all currencies: yen, USD, euros, *and* BTC. I think the continuous, senseless arguments that "if you pay in BTC you're just paying in dollars" goes on *probably* because people forget BTC is a currency and a protocol. But, I highly doubt that..

Sorry for the noob sounding question, but I feel like I missed something big on a day I wasn't browsing the web.

Then mining seems to be your go-to here.
I've honestly haven't used any USB miners, as I have a spare computer that runs the Bitminter client for me and has managed to mine me up 0.0000012 namecoins and 0.00004 total BTC (not because it's slow, I only used it a few times because my internet provider sucks).
Though, having the USB miners/servers are a good way to mine up some fast, just make sure you don't buy any of the Butterfly labs ones - get one from a trusted company. Just note though that the USB miners and/or servers can be pricey themselves, and they will require a lot of wattage and if you really want your machines to solve problems and get blocks, you'll really need to invest in a very good and reliable internet service.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:50:48

@_date: 2014-05-30 07:32:28
I could tell by looking at the links. If spam like that keeps happening everytime one major piece of news about Bitcoin gets released, then will most likely need to start banning words from posts as well (to start off, how about "dish").
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:21:49
Are you talking about the "Tweet for BTC?" that is shown on the homepage of your Blockchain wallet? If so, just to let you know: that only works once. 
You'll get about 0.0001 BTC for it. The message has to stay **AS IS** as well for it to work, and a confirmation and transaction can take a while before you will see the BTC in your wallet.
Again; this only works once, and isn't mentioned (to my knowledge) at all in the Terms of Service. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 05:41:36
It's kinda like something I think of as the "Big brother, little brother" theory.
Say Bitcoin is the big brother - the first born in a sense of speaking and the oldest. All the other altcoins (other cryptocurrencies) are the little brother(s), newer and been here less but gaining their inspiration from their big brother. 
The little brother knows it's big brother has lots of friends - he was here before him and has been around longer, so whenever the little brother (the altcoins) get new friends (new people in the community) they'll be extremely happy, because it makes them feel like they're being like their big brother and could eventually have more friends then their big brother one day.
Something like that, that's how I think the Bitcoin community is separated from the other altcoin communities.

@_date: 2014-09-04 18:45:21
OK. I mean, stuff like this (to me at least) makes it seem like everyone who is invested into BTC is trying to make sure it get's forced down the throats of everyone. BTC is awesome, but it doesn't mean everyone should start using it, investing, etc.
That's just strange if you think everyone should.

Take the 4 you have now, and turn them into more than 90. That's how all currency works; it's a true miracle to be able to work from little to even nothing and end up with hundreds and thousands of dollars (or in this case...BitCoins)

A little too much at once, wouldn't you think? Making the jump to accept BitCoin is a big step in of itself, but then giving discount for paying in a specific currency? That may take a little while and *a whole lot* of convincing..
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:45:45
Ah, wow. I love it when authors of expensive novels detail things of someones interests and then bluntly insert "In my new book for $50 I blah blah blah."

@_date: 2014-06-04 22:04:12
You could check out the [Oxwall software.](
It's open source and social based, but you can config it around to make it focused on commerce only and use plugins like Shop Pro and Cart to sell things and then use any of the current two Bitcoin gateway plugins to accept bitcoin payments (one is a bitpay powered one, the other uses info from block chain to let users pay in BTC directly to your wallet)
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:13:50
Never used woocommerce or any bitcoin-related plugins for Wordpress, so I wouldn't really have an opinion. Try reading the reviews on it, though.
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:59:38
From my own opinion, I don't care if it ever becomes a worldly-accepted currency all Governments trust. I actually like the idea of having the USDollar *AND* having BitCoin.
Of course no one is going to accept any cryptocurrency as a new form of fiat while just forgetting about the actual, physical world currency in effect now. So, if Bitcoin stays as a protocol that hosts BTC as its digital currency, and USD stays the way it is (and all other physical currencies for that) then I believe that your proposed fairness shouldn't be enabled. The only reason early adopters benefit is because they wede pioneers to it; to a technology that runs a digital currency - that *is* something that can be treated as stock.
Think Oregon trail as an example; everyone who survived the journey got land and were able to start up settlements and businesses. No one else could get dibs from there on unless they purchased it out (hence why people see BTC as a Property over a currency).
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:13:40
Unfortunately, not too many are free. People work hard on those things, I know from experience. The shop ones aren't free either.
I figured you had some budget set aside since you were starting a web commerce website.

It depends on what your resources are and what you'd feel more comfortable doing. Already have cash, bank accounts, all that fancy stuff? Buy and trade BTC on online markets like [ANXpro](
IT or Computer-savvy person who has a bad-ass graphics/video card and reliable processor AND fast internet connection? Get some mining software and let your machines have at it with programs like [Bitminter]( or maybe go into "mining pools" and work to solve blocks with other miners.
Whichever sounds best to you really. Pick your poison and enjoy Bitcoin!

So, what? is filled with a bunch of crappy stories and posts - banned list or not. They're sorta like TechCrunch; only stories about the business behind people and places that make technology. Same for all I ever see is mainly post about Bitcoin ATMs being released and new online stores that use bitcoin, rather than anything serious about the cryptocurrency itself.
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:45:01
No, I don't think the owners of those companies would allow it. Bitcoin can be integrated into your own system very easily if you have a experienced team of programmers with you, so Facebook and Amazon (PayPal basically sees anything to be like Bitcoin "evil), can just integrate the open source software themselves rather than just buying out those who already have.
Then again, over the past two years, especially with Facebook, we've seen how much money they're willing to throw away just because they don't feel like creating their own system...

I'm sure all cloud mining providers have their little hidden fees within them. They'll pay for the hashing that you can use to mine faster, but they'll be deducting big chunks of what you mine up.
Not only that, they probably all have advertisements plastered all over the place to gain some physical revenue from you as well.

What you're looking for is called a *freelancer.* More specifically, one that accepts payments in *BTC*. They all have different contracts, policies, etc., that you have to read and agree to and they charge different hourly wages too. 
As for


Most freelancers won't accept to work with you unless you give, **in detail,** what you need to be done with your project. It's all about trust and if you deliberately give little to no details and tell them you don't trust them, they won't want to work with you at all.

The problem is, how will the homeless get the money to print out QR codes and/or purchase smartphones with service to use wallets? I mean, you could start by trying to put together a foundation to give smartphones (pre-paid would be best) and service cards to homeless people - that would take a lot of money though but I'm sure some prepaid smartphone provider would love to have that support shown by them.
Then, in the meantime, we could teach those that are in poverty/homeless how to use Bitcoin (such as make purchases, transactions, set up wallets) at a public library while they wait to get a phone.
I'd love to start a foundation like that - give some phones to homeless people in the area and teach them about BitCoin, maybe start each person off with $20 worth of BTC and help them learn how to invest in it so they can go from living on the streets to living in a nice apartment or home thanks to a digital currency and a little bit of caring.
@_date: 2014-06-11 17:43:17
