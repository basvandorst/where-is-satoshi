It will certainly shake all the weak hands out of the market.  But if hodlers hodl and new investors with stronger hands buy discounted BTC, we could win in the end.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:05
Literally the million dollar question.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:32:21
Sure there is.  If you sell a little now you can buy back at the low.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:39:52
Doesn't this open the door to "insider trading" in the sense that tips to FUD could make shorts very profitable, thus fucking with Bitcoin's legitimacy?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:44:42
 Because it has the bitcoin name association I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:57:55
She had a nightmare you sold all your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:19
I see stabilization around 7-9k but this is based on intuition only and no real information.  Hope that helps.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:41
Exchanges could use a different denomination like a milibit or Satoshi...
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:45:06
Well it would be interesting to live in complete anarchy...I guess...on second thought...maybe a little state is good...I like a little order.

Andreas blocked me on Twitter and I don't even know why.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:08
Is this another BCH psy-op?
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:18:41
Oh ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:30:21
Right.  Doesn't this prove that BCH and BTC can work hand in hand together?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:24:55
They're meant to reassure the poster that they made the right decision.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:50:54
What? Oh God no!!  Please don’t report me. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:40:00
Honest question:  Do you really think bitcoin is bubbling or do you hope it is bubbling because you cashed out?
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:08:37
So no manipulation. Ever.  Never.

I got a weird DM from some guy names Andreas who said I should sell my BTC now.  He said he's kind of a big deal and liked an old post of mine and was just wants to help.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:45:10
It will get really confusing if all the big dog exchanges decide to name b2x the real bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:56:59
Ah.  I should have known that.  Thanks.

@_date: 2017-11-08 20:01:57
Is there a way to look these curiosities up on the block chain? Like is there somewhere where you can look at the "top wallets"?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:23:34
When you set it up, it gives you a recovery seed consisting of 24 (I think) words.  Keep that recovery seed and if your Trezor gets lost or destroyed, you can still access your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:46:00
A demand for convenience maybe. There are still some boomers who can barely open an email. Then we’re back to square one. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:20:20
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:31:58
Possibly. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:29:39
Prove it by sending me one.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:21:49
The first bitcoin was actually mined by a guy named Mario in 1985.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:41:09
What am I looking at here?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:52:58
If he has a lambo then yes he secretly bought some BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:47:53
Holy shit!  I always wondered if that guy sat in a casting room as the only white actor and was like “This is all mine.”  
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:48:08
I suppose not. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:36:08
I think 10k will make BTC seem unattainable. Many will say, “I can’t afford one coin.  I guess I missed the train.  Oh well.”  But I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:45:21
But a two-day redditor told me we're going to the moon today.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:26:27
Not unless they know your pin code.  You'll set that up also when you start using the device.  
Edit:  I think if they are expert hackers they can downgrade the firmware and upload a program to access your seed but they would have to be very high level.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:39:32
Why would it dip before the fork? I thought everyone wanted in so they can get their free coins.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:17:50
Wow.  This cleared up a lot for me. Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:58:34
Can you explain the scaling problem?  I see people talk about it, but I never know what it specifically refers to.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:34:23
$3,900 after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:12:43
I tried sending a bitcoin but it said invalid address.  Are you sure this is the right one.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:49:41
1 trillion dollars?
Edit:  Nevermind.  My bad
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:12:07
Could this happen?:
1.  The US government tips off big banks that they are going to regulate/ban bitcoin exchanges.
2.  Big banks short bitcoin.
3.  Government publicly regulates/bans bitcoin exchanges
4.  FUD casues panic selling
5.  Bitcoin price drops
6.  Banks make big money on the short
7.  Bitcoin dies
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:11:28
Bitcoin notes coming soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:59:56
Honestly I did the same thing so I can have equal amounts of each.  I got in after the August fork so I didn't get the free coin.  Maybe you should hodl it just in case too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:46:42
But what does that mean?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:32:31
No idea. BCH was around $700 per coin in beginning then dropped to $300ish
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:54:30
Look up Trezor on Amazon.  It's an online wallet but your private keys (codes that allow you to send away bitcoin) are stored on a little USB device that you have to plug in before sending.  It's very secure.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:13:20
I think it was identified as not safe on bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:10:59
I bought one at around $1300 yesterday because I got into Bitcoin after the August fork and didn't get the free coin then.  I wanted equal amounts of each just in case.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:01:46
The world is on fire but muh BTC
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:51:40
Does that mean there are 21 million people with at least one bitcoin in the world?
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:54:52
Someone will say they wished they were in crypto way back in 2017 some day. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:47:41
So have you sold everything (or most of everything) because you know it is going to crash?  Serious question.  I'm not trying to insult you.  I just want to know how confident you are.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:30:53
Hopefully goes down to $3,000 so I can buy some more sale coins.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:57:47
Yea, I just realized that.  So I wonder how many people in the world have at least one bitcoin,
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:41:49
Did something happen?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:06:08
Nah.  With so much ample cheap food and housing, these are more "Teach a man to fish" times.  Maybe you can quit your job and dedicate time to educating people who make bad life skill decisions or something, but the world doesn't need any more gibs.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:00:05
This wreaks of advertising. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:37:50
Well isn’t it when early investors at the top benefit from late adopters at the bottom. 
Don’t get me wrong. I love bitcoin but I couldn’t help but wonder. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:48:26
Im just asking. Just a little curious. But if bitcoin gets as big as we want it to the cost will be negligible I think. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:15:14
Wait until the Fork. A lot of volatility incoming. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:45:26
Just buy 1000 BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:40:29
I was wondering what you were going to do.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:47:11
Why the hell would you want a mortgage when you can buy it in cash??????????????????????????????????  This makes me think this is fake.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:39:03
That may be why the BTC pump is so big. After Fork and everyone gets their two coins a lot will dump out and price may fall. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:37:38
Seems like it would be a psychological moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:26:38
Cool. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:00:25
Typical. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:03:08
Depressing for some reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:59:53
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:08:45
Yes.  It's just like any wallet.  You send bitcoin from coinbase to your Trezor wallet address and just leave it there.  
From what I've gathered, Trezor will most likely give you access to S2x coins once it has been deemed safe so it could take a while.

But I like human beings.  I miss them.  I want to engage with other unplugged human beings.  And not just a small group of outliers...I would like to see the internet completely destroyed, even for just a couple months to see what happens.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:43:44
Sure.  The internet is us...hiding under our beds typing without fear...low risk, high reward.  When we get out from under our beds and get face to face, we are different people.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:36:29
I'll take it.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:04:40
As a noob I honestly don't understand.  How do you run a bitcoin?  Are you referring to the wallet?
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:56:16
I prefer the concept of foreigners over some universal cohesion.  Sounds pretty boring if the world is completely acquainted with each other. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:53:46
Yea but at least we were more human then. Maybe we were a littler simpler - for the better. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:15:39

@_date: 2017-09-28 16:38:40
Shit.  I have a Trezor hardware wallet because it's supposed to be safest.  Is this is a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:09:24
That's true.  If it starts going back up to late 2017 levels, I'd probably get pulled back in.  We'll see (hopefully).
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:34:53
They don't want attention drawn to their wealth.  They know it essentially makes them look evil so they try to look normal.

@_date: 2017-09-28 18:03:12
I guess every fork is a faction, right?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:26:13
I get that but couldn't  they ban Coinbase for example?  To at least slow things down?  Why don't they?  I don't see the gov't panicking at all.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:26:17
One can have a bias against an enemy.  And it's nice to see some passion.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:37:01
I use a Trezor.  Is Trezor for or against Segwit2x?  
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:19:28
Only put as much in as you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:21:28
Is my bitcoin safe in my Trezor? (I know it's not technically in the Trezor so no need to explain).
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:21:26
Hey genius, I'm just asking a question.  I'm all for Bitcoin - I just want to know why the gov't doesn't fight back against it.  They absolutely could ban the exchanges so why don't they?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:56:24
What exactly is a pump?  A pump in this context seems superficial and misleading.  How does BTC get pumped?  Serious question as I'm a newcomer.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:20:53
You're American right?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:23:06
My question is why did the gov't get freaked out and bad the liberty dollar and make arrests but seem not to care about Bitcoin? They may not be able to make any specific arrest regarding its founding but they could ban and regulate the shit out of it.  Why don't they?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:19:02
This was my reply.  I mistakenly thought I clicked reply.  Thanks.

@_date: 2017-09-27 18:19:51
Thanks for the heads up.

Waiting for the halving in December/January.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:49:39
And they want customer information for what? Taxes?
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:38:32
Shit.  I have a Trezor hardware wallet because it's supposed to be safest.  Is this is a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:29:43
I know.  I was using it as an example because so many people use it.  If you want to put a dent in Bitcoin, you would start banning the ways people buy it.  Why don't they?
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:59:24
I'm not trying to say I'm 12, but when I was 12 I probably would have said, "Thanks man!" or "Thanks bro!" or "Thanks dude!" You are clearly a foreign man.  Just saying.  
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:10:05
Does using a Trezor mean that I hold my keys?
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:16:01
Anything above their buy-in is a big deal for new people and new people today are still in early adoption phase.  And what is with the last paragraph? Do you even have a girlfriend?
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:37:24
So after S2x, if the price gets really volatile and halves, where is the best place to buy?  
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:48:59
Know I do not.
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:21:17
I think it's a valid question in a Bitcoin forum where everyone brags about toppling the banking system.  I can't imagine anyone with common sense that has not asked the same question to themselves.  
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:35:28
12 year olds call people "friend"
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:40:21
What was the point of this?
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:05:46
But where do they capitalize?  Transaction fees? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:10:33
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:02:38
Just speculating with all the volatility that will probably occur after S2X.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:54:13
I'm a holder.  They aren't going anywhere.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:24:30
But if it's such the threat to the dollar and economy like we think it is, why don't they ban exchanges like in China? Or make it illegal for businesses to accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:13:00
Ah the blonde robber.  So brave.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:30:42
Nobody give Hamid any bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:11:58
Come on man.  It was a good idea and you can start over anytime you want, but just admit it.  Are you in Russia? India?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:34:06
Don't people just sell it on Coinbase or other exchanges?  Doesn't seem that hard to do.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:19:21
What about my Trezor?  Can I just leave my bitcoin on Trezor?
