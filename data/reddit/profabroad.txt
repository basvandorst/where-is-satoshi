Not everyone is from the us. Some countries don’t treat gains differently from income. So you want to rebalance and take some profits now some later so you don’t end up in a higher tax bracket. Japan is like that. They count gains as misc income unless you hold for 5 years and it’s still not clear cut to get any kind of long term cap gains. Though corporations can get different tax rates for capital gains.

I'm in Kyushu and we have nimoca. I understand that icoca has interoperability with nimoca. So does it mean that your system will work here as well? The interoperability also goes for pasmo and suica according to Wikipedia. So that would mean basically anywhere?
I would be willing to upgrade my phone for this if it works.

I think the law is not on the side of the bitcoin trader in this case.  I saw the episode as well, but the problem is that he has to sue the person who cheated him to recover his funds.  It is his fault that he didn't keep record of the person who deposited money into his account fraudulently.  In this case, each transaction is considered separately, so if the bitcoin trader was defrauded, he has to seek settlement or persecution of the person who caused him harm.  He can sue for the money he had to pay to the truck buyer as well.
Also, most of the information Judy gets is in the written responses, not the questioning that you see on the show.  So, I guess that he did not explain the situation well, though I still think the law is not on his side.
Full disclosure, I am not an expert in this law, so I could be wrong.  That is my armchair understanding, though.
