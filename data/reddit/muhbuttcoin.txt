I agree, I was a little harsh. Not all blame should fall on the employees and Andreas. I do think however that their mea culpa is an insufficient way of addressing what happened.

You assume total and complete knowledge in your first sentence. The factors you list are definitely important, but it definitely doesnt paint the whole picture. In 10 years the internet could be radically different and the concept of P2P could disappear (goodbye, net neutrality). The United States could ban bitcoin. China could ban bitcoin. So many things could happen that you can not account for.

There are just as many if not more people saying "more coins for me" while in reality most of those people arent investors and are not buying anything, just trying to counter the fear by creating an atmosphere of greed.

In finances, and life in general, past performance is not at all a guarantee of future results.

Volatility is a huge problem, its the signs of a very immature market and shows that most participators in the bitcoin trade are speculators who have no particular preference whether bitcoin crashes or bubbles. Would you like to have a currency where one day you can buy a car with your savings and the next day you cannot?
Deflation... another huge problem. Why would you spend your coins if the scarcity and therefore price increases by doing nothing? When everyone holds, it ceases to act effectively as a currency and everyone gets hurt. Inflation on the other hand encourages those to spend and invest in order to avoid losing wealth.
The echo chamber sure is loud today...

What is your source that there is "more progress and acceptance" for bitcoin? Might that source be biased?
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:45:43
History is important to consider only in cases where the conditions surrounding that history are identical to the situation you are trying to predict. At that point you are no longer doing historical analysis but future analysis, and since very rarely are situations identical, historical analysis can be very misleading. This is a golden rule in finances and market analysis. The smallest differing factor can lead to wildly different results than history might lead you to believe.

I agree with you first of all that bitcoin has great future potential, and that *forward looking* perspective is not a stupid thing to bet on. But betting that because of a past pattern that crashes and bad news are meaningless is not a wise strategy at all.

From your own source the lawyer says 150,000 attacks not transactions. Basically ddos which is perfectly feasible, IMO probable, and also in line with their claims since day 1.
Edit: thought I was talking to op, but point stands

Thats not how security concerns should be dealt with, although thankfully smarter people have already considered this potential flaw.
Security through obscurity never works out well.

Thats not hard evidence, that barely fits the bill of being considered circumstantial evidence. Hard evidence would be along the lines of mtgox demonstrating control of the bitcoins for a reputable auditor or government agency.

I think you may be deluding yourself then. Capital gains is the tax that the richest rich people pay, and it has been lobbied to death already. It is already the lowest percentage tax bracket out there except for taxes on people with income less than ~$20000.
Those people who bought in at $10, and cashed out at $1000, they get to pay the lowest tax bracket possible on their gains. Did those people honestly expect not to pay taxes on that?
If bitcoin sheds itself of speculators and maintains a somewhat stable price, the IRS wont be getting anything from capital gains anyway. I think at that point they will revise their interpretation and treat it like currency.

Bitcoin still allegedly served as a medium of exchange to facilitate the transfer of gains from illicit activity into dollars for alleged criminals. If I were to use real estate, which is considered property under tax law, in the same way, it would also be considered money laundering. Criminal law is a way different animal from financial law.
@_date: 2014-03-11 05:10:24
Do you have any hard evidence otherwise?

While many of the posts here are obviously trolls, and I'm risking being put in a karma graveyard, I think there is a lot of legitimate anger at all parts of neo&amp;bee, including the CEO, the employees, and you. It's not enough for everyone involved to wash their hands of it and blame the CEO. You were all willing participants in this scam, and you lent the company your credibility without any due diligence to avoid a disaster.
There are lots of things you can repair with an apology and a long winded post on the Internet. Unfortunately your reputation is not one of them.

Very smart post, thanks for the quick refresher on tax law. If the usage of bitcoin eventually transitions from hoarding and pump and dumping into typical currency usage, I'm sure they will re-evaluate their interpretation.
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:02:46
While I agree with those dismissing OP's conspiracy theories, open source and being reviewed by "tons of people" does not mean it is secure, as we learned with OpenSSL and the recent heartbleed exploit.... According to bloomberg the NSA knew about heartbleed pretty much as soon as it was exploitable while the rest of the world had no clue.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:41:07
I'm not making any predictions either way here, but tbh your post comes off as dogmatic and cultish and its not what we need around here to improve bitcoin's reputation.

I don't know the details of the mtgox debacle, but a ddos component of the attack has been claimed and reported since mtgox's first public statements. What type of ddos attack there was, and what role it played in a possible theft is another matter which few people are qualified to debate.
Opinions below, I am not your lawyer, and this is not intended as legal advice.
Lawyers and wealthy business owners simply do no go into court and tell tons of lies. Considering the abysmal conviction rate of those accused of financial crimes, why would they? Do you think courts would convict anyone of stealing bitcoin? Is such a theft even possible to prove absent a confession or similar piece of traditional evidence? Perjury is the fastest and likely only way to prison for these folks.
I think the bitcoins were stolen from mtgox, just as they are claiming in their court filings. And even if I did not think that, absent any hard evidence, it doesn't really matter what I think.

You will need coding skills to understand the blockchain beyond non-technical summaries (the source code is publicly available to study). Also you will need to be well versed in modern cryptography to understand the private-key/public-key system of transaction reporting and verification by consensus.

So you expect free money and usage just because you made something and are attempting a half ass viral marketing campaign? How does that make you different from everyone else here?
