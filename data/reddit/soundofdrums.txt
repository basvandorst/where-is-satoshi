Between the Bitcoin Bowl and people giving Bitcoin for the Holidays, we're moving on up in the world it seems.

When you own fiat, what do you own?  It's not backed by precious metals anymore.

In practice, it's really just scanning a QR code and entering how much you'd like to send over.  Definitely not as bad as it sounds when you look at the technical side.  It's kinda like trying to explain what the dollar is by explaining how the Federal Reserve works. :)

The internet access in the US is not billed by amount of data used, and that's not what net neutrality is about.  Anti net neutrality laws and regulations, like the ones the FCC is planning to implement out of laziness, would allow charging a premium for a website to have faster speeds.  The actual application of this would be a reduction of every website's speed unless they paid for "premium" network speed to the providers.

When GDP started being thrown around, the business world's struggle was to get people to stop doing things like reading to your own children and growing your own food, right?  GDP was a measure of their success in monetizing everyone's lives.

They're all really nice people, if anyone is wondering.  I've worked with them before for non-precious metal related business.

Does the CNG mean Compressed Natural Gas, or does it stand for something else in the native tongue? 
Would be pretty forward thinking to not only have CNG and Bitcoin, kudos to the business owner if so.

After payment processing it comes to us as cash.  We would just figure out the drive out price with everything and it would be paid as such.

Good question.  BTC will stop being valued in other currencies when it stabilizes, which i would estimate as 1-5 years after the supply stops increasing.

CHristmas spending.  People are spending and selling bitcoin for Christmas.  February we'll be above $1250 minimum.  I expect more than $1500.
