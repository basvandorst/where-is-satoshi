i think this has to do with the fact that in North America its impolite to talk about money.
it's cool to talk about new tech and gadgets.
it's not cool to talk about esoteric internet shit, because we live in a scientifically illiterate society (am i just being an asshole?)
it's really really not cool to tell someone to switch currencies which is an esoteric brand new technology.
i was weary in 2014, didn't buy because i didn't understand the robustness of p2p.
my 'smartest' friends don't know shit about bitcoin or just aren't interested.
so adoption is slow and that's fine by me.
also the fact that scaling is obviously an issue right now (but like a light switch will vanish real real fast w lgntng) makes it seem like a joke.

1.not nearly as reckless as those putting large amounts into bitcoin?
wow, you must be out of your damn tree. the banking bailouts of 08' (let alone previous bailots) were much much larger than the entire market cap of bitcoin and shitcoins. you are stupid.
2. so because people are irrational, we need people to regulate people. right. cuz that's been working.

@_date: 2018-01-11 21:51:24
good point. i'd known that but when i did this napkin-math i hadn't considered this point.
so since the actual circulating supply is probably 85% of the 16million (who the hell actually knows) the effect of inflation is higher. the worth of each coin is higher. interesting

@_date: 2018-01-08 03:24:36
it depends.
if you think bitcoin will actually be a popular worldwide currency, we are most definitely early adopters. if you take majority in its literal sense we are nowhere near majority.
reddit has 500k subscribers, let's make an estimate from that number i think it would be liberal to say that 1/4 english native speaking bitcoiners subscribe to reddit. 
so thats 2million for north america and england.
add 3 million japanese
3 million chinese
2 million indian 
2 million south korean
let's throw in another 10 million for everybody else.
basically im doing order of magnitude thinking.
even if 50 million people hodl right now, that's really nothing.
considering how powerful remittance markets are.
off-shore banking (joseph poon [ln] twitter just mentioned this market)
and then money storage away from fiat aka savings accounts.
personally i'm of the opinion that irl retail using bitcoin is 'like taking a boeing down the street'.
but it's definitely still undervalued and that's because people still don't think of it as an actual form of money.
if it were an actual form of money and global, it should be on the top of this list: lopp.net/m1/rank.html
but it's not even close to that yet.
bitcoin is technical, it's easy to fuck up still, i've been waiting on an unconfirmed tx for a week, you've got to know what your doing.
i'm not smart enough technically to know whether lightning will do anything, but i hope it will and i believe in the ability of layer 2, but that's just me crossing my fingers.
i've been hodling since november 2017, just educating the fuck out of myself, as we all should be.

i starved too and just let my money sit in my account cuz i didn't know what to do and as a classic idiot 'didn't like money' until november 30th when the massive bull-run woke me up to bitcoin, i did research and hopped on. i also knew about bitcoin in 2013 and even went as far as registering with kraken back then, but didn't have real money back then to invest. and didn't blink an eye when someone told me i was too late in februar 2017 (1k price)
