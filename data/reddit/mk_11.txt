Maybe I was not clear enough. in Greece with capital controls any card that is issued as visa or mastercard from any 4 banks like Alpha bank, Eurobank, National bank and Peiraus bank, EU and IMF has closed all the others, you can only withdraw 420 euro per week. So with wirex we could use it better because it is issued abroad, and capital controls don't work on it. This easy way I can get 2.500 euro per day to do my work around. And btc is not accepted to pay taxes or lawyers here if you run a bussines. Or the employers don't want it. You must also know that paypall also is not working here, because of capital controls. Bitcoin the wirex card is accepted through paypall.

Hello have a nice day, Did you manage to make the arragements for accepting BTC ? 
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:21:47
My opinion is that we lose the big picture here, something is wrong with this situation. I follow the debate between the dev and my conclusion is that the banks would like to be benefit from the bitcoin effect. Is there an easier way than to persuade 2 people from the foundation to limit down the price of the bitcoin ? The point is the bitcoin costs more than the cold pound so for the banks to get involved with the blockchain without the bitcoin as they understand it wasn't possible , so their best effort is to try and as today seemed they had managed to create a big price drop. Nobody notice that the project has the Xt at the name , and the symbol is not innocent , im sure that means Nasdaq is behind it , also the bloomberg in the market shows the Xbt /Usd rate . I believe it is obvious the conspiracy !!!

Finally they manage to divide the community and to manipulate the bitcoin ! Well done to those who are in the side of the banks.

The Greeks are to be null average age 55, what is the appropriate way to convince them of the use of digital currency;
@_date: 2016-02-24 09:02:42
The use of BTC is what should determ the regulator to put in as a currensy or as a commodity.
If someone stores it , then it is commodity.
If another use it to pay things then is currency.
We have come infont a multipurpose innovation with BTC.
I think it must have both properties.
