You might want to consider using Melatonin instead for sleep aid. You can purchase it in the vitamin section of drugstores.
Congratulations on your investment success! Should be fun times ahead... :)

Their processing times and options are listed on their [funding]( page. Cavirtex charges a higher fee because they are a much more established exchange.

EMT and it took ~27 hours

I had the same experience. Been using LibertyBit for a month now and quite happy with the site, although volume is still small.

Congratulations! Seems to me that educating the public and convincing (or creating) more merchants to accept bitcoin is what is most needed.

This same sort of question gets asked often. [Here]( is the response I gave less than 24 hours ago.
Best of luck in whatever decision you make!

Favorite thing: The global adoption/support  ---
Least favorite: The uncertainty with how they might be regulated by different countries

Their EMT fee is $2, with a $1000/day limit.

I agree and have been using [LibertyBit]( instead since they change a 0.5% fee per transaction, regardless of volume.

I've been using [LibertyBit]( and am quite happy with them. They have much lower volume than cavirtex, but only charge a 0.5% fee.

It hit $225CAD on libertybit.com!

I had the same hesitation initially, so I just moved a bit of money in there. Been over a month now and although the prices may occasionally differ from the other sites, they usually fall into sync. Volume also has been increasing as more people learn about it, increasing trading opportunities.

$260 CAD now!

Last week people were asking if it was too late to get in at $100. 
Next week people might be asking if it will be too late to get in at $400...

How very generous of you!

I've been using both sites and have had positive experiences. Wish CaVirtEx would lower their fees though...
