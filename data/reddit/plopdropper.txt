I got the urge to buy an Antminer S9 with all of my coins when BTC was at £6.2k Im wishing I just held on to this coins now. Hopefully it works out in the long run, but who knows. I'm still doing my weekly purchases tho and I'm up 33% in two weeks which is crazy.

The same day Bitmain announces new miners, which have to be paid for in BCH.

Well I'm going to get a more tailored reply to this situation if I ask directly from someone who knows, I can ask the question come back to a detailed reply later on. It actually is easier. And nice contribution mate, bet you feel a lot better now.

Can someone explain to me what fiat actually means in the financial sense. I'm aware its a word used in this context but I've never actually looked it up.

Well now I know what to reference when I'm sending money to my mates online. Writing 'cocaine money' was getting a bit predictable.

Do you know if mBCC is another crypto? that is what my default balance is and is the address I used. If i sent BCC to a mBCC address will it disappear?

Wouldnt the funds show after the forst confirmation, or is that dependant on the wallet im using?

Mmmm Grub

Yeah I noticed that. The app does refer to bitcoin cash tho and nothing of bitcoin connect. Someone in the reviews also mentioned it to the devoloper. I think it may just be a typo (hopefully) still no sign of coins tho.

they also have just plain BCC and uBCC when you go into the settings. Appreciate you taking the time to reply. Ive emailed shapeshift and the devolopers of the app.

Just checked and it is definitely a BCH wallet. In the comments of the app on the app store someone else has had the exact same problem. The devoloper suggested resetting the block chain on the app. Is this safe to do?

Better make sure the DARPA chief doesn't mysteriously die of a supposed heart attack any time soon.
