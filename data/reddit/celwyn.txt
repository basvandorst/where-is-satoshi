But you know that bitcoin lost more of it's value this year than the ruble?
Bitcoin looses value because of mining. Currently each day Bitcoins worth $1.200.000 are newly produced.
Even with the best news (eg Microsoft) there isn't enough investment to offset mining.
Prices will only rise in 2016, when the block reward is halved.

On this great news Bitcoin will certainly loose at least $50 in value!

The continued loss of value, even with the best news possible?

Simply because everyday 3600 Bitcoins are mined. At current price this equals 1,200,000 $ every day.
If on any given day less that 1.2 million Dollars are newly invested in Bitcoin, then Bitcoin looses value. It's money printing pure and simple.
We will see rising BTC prices only with the halving of the block reward mid-2016.

The price can't go up, because bitcoin is produced at a constant rate. The value of the mined bitcoins must equal the value of fresh investments in bitcoin, otherwise the price goes down.
At $300 that would mean that more than 1,000,000 dollars has to be invested each day just to keep the price.
This is a design error of bitcoin. It would be better to link the block reward with the change in mining difficulty, so that when the hashrate goes down, production goes down too, stabilizing the prize.

Looks like the end of Scamcoin is near. Satoshi cashed out when the price was $1200, and now the bubble is gonna burst. Soon it will be under $100.
Down, down, down it goes.
