Thanks for posting this. I never really understood why cash-settled futures should affect BTC that much.. turns out it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I have a hard time seeing how BTC works. It's digital money, but if your bank account can go up and down 30% per day, how can the average person have a budget or even buy bread without first checking to see if BTC is high or low?

Easiest way is sell Bitcoin high then rebuy at a lower level.

How can you be an automatic teller if you don't do the things a teller does?
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:29:16
No. You still report it as income. You simply use the block chain as your bank. Anonymity would be useful to protect the owner, given millions a month may be going into one or two wallets.

@_date: 2017-09-13 01:47:06
Good points. Given the need for security and discretion with BTC, you might get a lot of underreporting of bags/income as well.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:10:24
Thanks for this explanation. I had the sense as growth becomes faster the dips will recover faster, even if they're deep, but wasn't able to explain the underlying economics.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:53:03
It's weird. You'd think an all cash business (in the US) like dispensaries would want to shift to crypto ASAP as they can't store the money in a bank and are really big targets, but it doesn't seem to be happening much at all. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:40:28
There's a few, but they seem to either be scams or abandoned projects.

You're right - if it hits a bank, it's money laundering. That's the problem crypto solves - it takes the bank and money laundering out of the question.

@_date: 2017-09-16 20:45:49
I agree. Look at all these tokens that are just placeholders until their block chain is built. They promise to swap out the temp tokens later for useful ones, but what good are the temp tokens *now*? They're useless; We could swap some rare tulip and then exchange it later for the real coins and it wouldn't really make much of a difference.

The data shows young, lower income white guys mainly have btc, which is the same demographics that I would guess are Reddit's. It's also possible that the two of a bit.

My debit card wouldn't work either if the power went out.
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:37:42
They would accept Bitcoin as payment like a cab or anyone else. Do you mean it would be hard for them to convert back to fiat? What if they used an anonymous coin?
By going digital you vastly reduce your security costs and overall risk. Dispensaries could give a 10% discount for using crypto and that would be a win-win for everyone.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:10:51
I think we're going to see this pattern a lot. I've read a lot of forex traders shift to crypto after markets close on Friday, then the money gets shifted back by Monday (or sooner).

Makes sense. I also don't think we're going to see crypto debit cards gain widespread use anytime soon. No way a single Mom is going to wait until BTC is up to buy her groceries.
A macroeconomic shock is a major economic event outside the market that changes market dynamics. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:47:50
So true. I bet the brain probably responds similarly to gambling.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:44:02
I agree. But if you're a single Mom making $30k a year, maxing your credit cards, working two jobs and using free time to cook, clean, help with schoolwork, drive kids to games, etc I don't think she's worrying about a global financial collapse.

@_date: 2017-09-04 03:05:18
Here's my elevator pitch:
Imagine you a own a dispensary. You're making $250,000 a week in cash. Everyone in town knows where you live and that you a cash business that can't be stored in a bank. You've been in business 10 years and have $15 million in cash hidden in the walls, buried in the backyard, etc. How safe do you feel? What if i told you that you could store all that money legally in the cloud and it would be 100% secure. Not only that, your customers will give you money going forward in digital currency. Yes, it'll be a little bit of a hassle to get you setup with our [TenX / Monaco / whoever ] partner's debit card so you can easily spend the money, but think how much easier you'll sleep at night.
On the regulatory side:
Our coin establishes smart contracts with the IRS and CA so that dispensaries can't under report their revenue, and tax is automatically paid through the contract, increasing tax revenues.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:33:05
Right, so it's not really an ATM, but still super cool!
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:19:40
It's funny because it's true.
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:29:11
You could. But mj has been available in dispensaries for 20 years in California, yet they haven't adopted block chain. I'd do some focus groups with dispensary owners to find out if the problem is awareness or something we're not thinking of.The other thing to look into is whether Canadian dispensaries will be able to use banks. If they are, it's less of a pain point; if they can't use banks like in the US, crypto coins are a lot safer than literally hiding millions around your house.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:17:01
That's some pretty big FOMO.
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:41:04
Yep. Get paid in crypto and use a debit card linked to crypto that TenX is using. Solves a massive problem.
You could partner with Weedmaps, pull in dispensaries' menus, allow people to order/pay in advance, tie in delivery, and use Civic to confirm their medical recommendation/identity. 
Adds convenience for the user and security/safety for the dispensary.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:36:26
We also call this spot "crossing the chasm" because it's where a massive amount of products fail to gain widespread adoption and die off. Hopefully cards like TenX or Monaco will fix adoption, but I agree these are definitely times to focus on improving value and usability to pave the way.

@_date: 2017-09-16 01:27:12
So does that mean it shouldn't hit much resistance going back up, or does it mean charts don't do great with macroeconomic shocks?
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:22:52
That makes sense. So until we get price stabilization there's not going to be a shift to a cashless society.
Turns out BTC is already pretty mature market though, according to this MIT study: 
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:29:49
That doesn't tell us sentiment, so it's hard to say what will happen. It could be a lot of people trying to figure out how to cash out, or a lot of people looking to buy in. Hell it could be a bunch of people trying to figure out what Bitcoin is after reading about it in the WSJ. Hopefully it means lots of new people replacing China!
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:08:27
My first decent dip, but my mentality is we're either going to $500k or $0, so im trying to look at this as a Bitcoin fire sale or a time machine that lets me go back and buy in earlier than i did. Hopefully that's the right move...
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:14:45
Check out Blockfolio for your phone - you can set one time or persistent alerts for any coin on any exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:20:29
One way? I can deposit, withdraw and transfer funds through an ATM. Seems three-way.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:19:27
I have a hard time understanding how the average person will spend currency when it can swing 5-10% on any day. Isn't that essentially like potentially experiencing 5-10% inflation on any given day due to dilution of value?
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:55:50
The best time for you to invest in Bitcoin was several years ago. The second best time for you to invest is today. Use dollar cost averaging and you don't have to worry as much about the crashes.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:45:45
I'd like to know this too. Are people trading and looking for a 2% or 20% return?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:56:04
That makes sense, thanks.

I get that. But can I store bitcoin and litecoin *at the same time*?
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:47:31
Cool, thanks! Just ordered one from Jet.com. Do I need one for each currency or will one Trezor store BTC, ETH, and LTC?
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:16:46
I'm looking to invest several thousand over time in Bitcoin, Ethereum and some alt-coins. Are Trezors safe? Can you recommend a site that allows me to store multiple types of coins?
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:51:12
I checked the website, but it makes it sound like you can only use it with one currency at a time, which is why I was asking.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:06:03
Thanks!
