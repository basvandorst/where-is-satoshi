SAY BUY BITCOIN!! Haha love this guy 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:02:05
I’m telling him don’t attempt to trade. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:04:22
For when it goes down to 0? Why do people alway have to say that on here? Bitcoins value may decrease but it is NEVER going to 0 or even close to that.  Shills
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:06:18
I just see that so much on here it seems like FUD to me. Just increases overall negativity in the sub.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:00:10
Don’t listen to random internet strangers. Just hodl
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:32:21
This is so true.

Excuse my ignorance but what does the lottery have to do with anything? The money is still in circulation..

Morocco is a monarchy. There is little to no opportunity. The wealth distribution is ridiculous.

If the incentive is that their bitcoin becomes worth much more they will work very hard. Self interest makes the system stronger.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:50:43
Right 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:37:20
I can’t take the damn crash metaphors anymore!
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:49:18
Ok sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:32:21
Oh lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:02:21
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:04:39
He’s saying how can it be a bubble when we aren’t even at 1% adoption. 16k might seem overvalued to you but when you realize how much fiat is circulating as appose to bitcoin then you will see how one bitcoin can have so much value. Just my 2 Satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:24:06
For what reason? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:08
They didn’t understand

@_date: 2017-12-01 14:38:19
You’re not wrong.

Coins available to mined is halved every 4 years until the last bitcoin is mined in 2149
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:04:42
I’m a fellow hodler and Idk what he is smoking. He says litecoin is speculative as if bitcoin isn’t still at that stage. This is cult like behavior that makes me dislike some ppl on this sub. Technology wise yes litecoin may compete, but majority of the trust of crypo market lies with bitcoin. That’s not to say Ltc doesn’t have a bright future!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:40:19
He must be very sad
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:12:21
I’m assuming you meant drama wise it was more than a dip. I think your comment is mis-understood. Thanks for helping the newbies!
You’re still a Karma whore tho :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:39:37
Great analogy 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:17:11
I’ll take 10000 of your finest bitcoin at $1 please

It’s not just “artificial rarity” that makes it valuable. You people will never learn I swear.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:07:06
Please buy some rn then so I can buy more

That’s hilarious for some reason 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:08:18
A lot of people boast about their bad luck lol. It’s everywhere. Buy high sell low that’s the motto here
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:35:02
This makes me happy for some reason 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:42:24
Super weak hands

I don’t even get the point of the joke? Are you implying that mostly African Americans take advantage of Black Friday? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:49:53
Check your exchange account equivalent
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:13:59
Wow. I clicked that expecting a joke. I have no words. I’m done with reddit for today.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:48:10
No way..
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:23:44
When you do try they just shrug it off like you didn’t just reveal what you just did. That’s when I’m like you know what fuck it, I’ll go get rich on my own.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:40:52
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:19:46
Exactly ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:16:34
Exactly. If you truly believe in it just buy and enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:48:53
He just said not on the return trip..
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:21:58
Why? It’s a fact about bitcoin as of right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:47:22
Truer words have never been spoken
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:04:52

You my friend have not experienced the full wrath of a real dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:56:16
Thank you. I assumed so.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:45:22
What is the best platform to do your kind of trading? How can I start? As of right now I’m just holding but I’d like to play with some of the money I’ve already made. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:38:50
Excellent question. And insight.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:29:05
Yes. Dollar cost averaging is your best bet. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:16:31
In Morocco you can get one for .2 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:20:43
It’s not going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:12:07
Nah at that point he was giving a friend a ride for gas money lol. Just because he drives for Uber doesn’t make him Uber’s slave. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:12
That’s some backwards thinking you got there. If it rises in price or even maintains its value why would you not want to buy in? So you’ll wait for months and you think as soon as you buy then it dips the “dip” you’re looking for? I don’t get that though process at all. “If it keeps rising, I won’t buy”
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:28:47
That’s rough 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:41:11
You obviously know know nothing about bitcoin and why it has value in the first place. Do some research.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:22:49
What website is that? If you don’t mind me asking 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:14:29
SOMEBODY GET YO MANS

A trip overseas are way less than 1BTC now..
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:14:53
General rule of thumb. Price goes down if you buy, price goes up if you sell. Hasn’t failed me yet 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:51:37
Me too! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:43:14
Where did you get such an absurd assumption. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:54:13
Smh tighten up
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:14:34
I was driving, I just pressed share on the article post bc it was big news. I don’t care about karma, just wanted to spread the news.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:16:01
Not intentional. Calm down 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:54:37
Trust me, me too. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:08:57
Be careful what you wish for.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:13:13
Lmao 
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:37:59
Indeed 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:39:36
Not to be rude. It’s news that benefits the crypto community. I don’t see credit being taken. Who’s to say his investment wasn’t a direct result of the integration? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:34:35
You just send them to your wallets “receive” address.
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:48:12
I lol’d
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:45:56
It’s okay old man. Don’t let him discourage you.
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:56:51
Yes you can. Try coinbase or gdax
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:13:10
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:27:51
Yeah that’s how markets work.. I’m asking why 
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:09:16
What circumstances would lead to that? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:37:35
You must be new here... and not know how adoption works.
