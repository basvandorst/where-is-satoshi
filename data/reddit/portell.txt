Thank you for the link, I will take a look.
That is what is also so crucial is being able to tie customer to payment and payment to account, especially with something like a phone, as I do offer real Canadian telephone numbers, those numbers need to be able to have customers and addresses tied to them for emergency services.
So in theory, I could just use the persons telephone number as the unique or part of the unique address.
It all really does come full circle.
Thank you for the lead!

At the end of the day to pay my own costs it will have to be converted into Canadian currency.
While I would love to be able to stock pile the coin, it's likely going to be hard to do that in the beginning, as it would be great to see the value go up! 
In the end I would like to be able to provide people with what I hope to be is another way to use the currency. So what I am after is a really user friendly way for people to pay for their monthly invoice using the bitcoin.
So what I'm guessing your saying is, 
do I want to just accept bitcoin with unique addresses for each customer, and then have more stock of bitcoin.
Or do I want to have a payment processor translate the bitcoin to cnd on the spot.
I see the difference. And I suppose I am stuck on that one, The payment processor seems to be fastest way to get the currencies converted, but with just taking the bitcoin directly and converting it later or leaving it, might be a more secure way to manage it.
I suppose I am looking for a way to integrate. As currently, it is not a complete web solution that is hands off.
I suppose I am looking for a simple way to say "hey I accept bit coin as payment"
with either option to pay through the web portal,
or with an invoice link.
So I think I am leaning towards integration.
Thanks for your comments, what do you think I should do? As I am a one person team.

So with a cloud PBX, what is happening is traditionally a PBX is on site. The software and switch are located on the premise of the business.
What I am doing is removing the need for an expensive on site switch.
I am hosting the switch in the cloud so that, the businesses phone system is not inherently tied to the business HQ.
This allows for many remote extensions and portability of your office solution.
