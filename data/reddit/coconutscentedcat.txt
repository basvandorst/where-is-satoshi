Agreed. Didn't Ross Ulbricht  have an entirely different personality online, as DPR.

I put money into it and it goes either up or down in value. As far as investing goes it's just like a stock. The vast majority of people are not buying BTC to use it; they're buying it as an investment. There are plenty more proven ways to invest money wisely, but everybody wants to become a quick millionaire. The gravy train has passed, if these people think it's going to x100 in value or even x1000 than they're truly delusional. It's like investing in Facebook now and expecting to make huge profits, because it made people filthy rich in the past. *rant rant rant*

It's ridiculous that OP is 'investing' (gambling) his life savings into BTC because he believes in it's future. I believe in the continuing success of companies like facebook, google and walmart, but I don't invest my net worth into them. 
BTC makes people feel like investors and stock brokers. It's just another stock... there are millions of those, except the others don't make it on memes and the front page of Reddit. It's naive to invest so much into btc

But why didn't you buy in at $13? Now you have to work 40hrs a week until you're old and grey. Why u do dis to urself cloudwarmer?? u could have had it all

You're being result-orientated. The result of the investment doesn't confirm that the investment was a wise and calculated choice. If I put 100k on a blackjack hand at the casino and win with 48% odds am I dumb for making the bet? I won! how could I possibly be dumb (your logic).

And a fair chance of losing significantly more than inflation would have lost you.

What good alternative is there? coinbase is having problems right now so I can't deal with them. And people on localbitcoin charge ~15% fee.

I don't think I'll get non-bias answers there

from what I can tell you cannot do this on poloniex

But I feel that the value of btc is bound to go down.. There have been few things in the history of man that have increased in value non stop. 
Maybe if there's a big delay in implementing SegWit the value may drop significantly. Or maybe a flaw will be found that will scare everyone off. I mean.. what are the chances of it being smooth sailing from here on out?
The only problem is that when drops it will probably rise again very very fast. I need to find a way to get an email alert when btc value drops past a certain point.

When you say digital withdrawals do you mean moving the btc to your wallet is free?
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:19:27
trading or fortune telling?

oh its 20% for credit card lol

Hoping for a big btc scandal to happen for it to really drop, then I'll join you guys and sit on it for 10yrs.

What's the cheaper alternative if I choose not to pay by CC? Coinbase  seems good, but it looks like they're having problems right now. Bitstamp is a lengthy process of depositing and withdrawing..
Man, I'm finding it hard to buy BTC as a first time buyer.. what a time consuming process
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:30:42
Hmmm the sellers that I checked so far charge like 15% fee. is this normal? seems pretty high..
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:00:32
Well, apparently SegWit is suppose to be implemented in a few months and I'm sure that will increase the value. I'm hoping a big dip will happen before then

How could anyone know the answer to questions like this?? What do you expect? If we knew the answer to such questions we'd be billionaires. Cryptocurrencies are unpredictable, the variance in change is huge, it's a volatile market. 
Ask this question and then flip a coin for the answer, it will be about as accurate as any reply in this thread. And asking this question in a sub where many btc investors frequent will mostly get you bias replies.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:02:09
don't you think its enough of a gamble to merely hold btc? and you want more gamble??
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:10:16
omg 2700 .. I can't wait for the crash, so that I can stop regretting not buying earlier.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:02:57
because 'steady' is a 25% increase in two weeks. in investing steady is 8% over a year. inb4 another dip
