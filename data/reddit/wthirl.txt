I was helping my parents with their windows 10 problems recently and i normally use linux and OSX. Holy shit that program has morphed into horrible monstrosity. Everything from windows 7 to the new stuff has been packed in there. It's actually unbelievable that people still use it as much as they do.

You're fucking foolish writing this on a 7 year old account. This could be worth a lot of money in the future. Imagine waking up in the back of a van with a hood over your head with someone about to cut your fingers off. Thats happened in the past for far less money.

If bitcoin reaches 150k per coin that results in 4.5 million. People will be on the lookout for old posts like this. Bitcoin is a fluid asset so being kidnapped is an excellent way for people to get your private keys out of you.

This guy is in poland anyway. I realised this by a 10 second glance at his account. A few more minutes would give me his city, then it's becomes a game to narrow it down. Then i spend 2000 euro for two security men to take him in the back of his van with me and ask him politely for his private keys.   
The sheer and utter terror of this experience would all have been avoided by keeping his fucking mouth shut.
