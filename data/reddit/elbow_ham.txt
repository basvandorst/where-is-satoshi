Well, they might be designed to be more modular, instead of throwaways, but technology is a bad example because of the rate of innovation.

it's not clear what you're getting at here
if you're talking about creating a new, separate block chain, that's like suggesting facebook or google create their own separate network for their services
on top of that, mining bitcoin is heavily incentivized which leads to the incredible hashing power that secures it-- non-monetary blockchains are incentivized to be attacked, not secured.

Who cares?  A transaction is a transaction, whether it's people stroking themselves with the blockchain or having risky fun that the government otherwise forces you not to--

@_date: 2017-03-25 09:57:39
I'm pretty sure that the Core developers's bizarre aversion to all things not exactly according to their complete control is the issue here.
THEY are in a position to show good faith by compromise--show their benevolence through action--not anyone else.  Unlimited and other options are just ways of exposing bitcoin's anti-fragile nature and aversion to central control.  It is inevitable, with the way the Core devs have been acting.
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:20:34

We have a fundamental difference of opinion.


Imagining you can somehow stop that from being the case--by outlining the rules for how the next scam has to work--and pretending to have the public good at heart is perhaps more evil than fraud itself.

coinbase and the user each get an exclusive one, and a shared one.  coinbase's copy of the shared one is encrypted with a user provided password, so the user has control of 2 out of 3.  coinbase also has an open source vault recovery tool for access to the coins if coinbase wer to go down.
I use it, I like it.  The 48 hour wait period with multiple confirmation e-mails before the transaction hits the chain is a nice touch.

Glad to hear it, his documentary on Napster was also quite good.

it will go away with maturity
i'm not completely informed on it, but BIP 70 should solve that problem--allows merchant and customer to communicate directly using bitcoin to synchronize payment
bitcoin is still a baby, and the impossible part is already solved.  the rest of this stuff is just fixed through work and experience
edit:  as an example does  make you think facebook?  this stuff takes time, but the vision is there

except the new boss is accountable via the blockchain, doesn't get to dictate monetary policy, and the fractional-reserve too-big-to-fail perverse risk incentive system is defeated
oh and getting in the way of innovation no longer is a thing
bitcoin over 5 years time &gt; history of banking

Isn't the invoice process through coinbase/bitpay a bit cumbersome for merchants?  So generating an invoice that doesn't get paid (like you've done) is kind of annoying
I'd love to see a shopping cart system where a QR code is right in your face the second that they have all the relevant info (like shipping address)--before even picking a payment option--but I don't know how feasible that is in a world where simple DoS attacks give people hacker cred

as one of the earliest big bumps in bitcoin awareness, they were happy to talk up and support the freedom aspect of the technology and the buzz flew around like whoa
but the reality is that it's still too early, and compared to microsoft and dell and whatnot, wordpress and bitcoin don't have much to offer each other at this moment

Could be because vaping has exploded over the past year (I'm guessing many of these vendors are very young companies) and entrepreneurs in this space are open to libertarian ideals.  Seeing governments all over the world scramble to accept lobbyist money and propose completely ignorant regulation that would destroy the vape market for that area may be opening eyes.
It's been amazing seeing this free market in action-- the rate of innovation in quality and safety along with the stigmatization of irresponsible vendors and products is a beautiful thing.

Once upon a time people would plug PCs directly into their modems and windows didn't come with a firewall.  That's where the nostalgia comes from, I think :)

that you trust your own judgement on this and call it "bit-coin" technology is cute
