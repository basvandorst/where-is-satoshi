Whoa, what softball just happened here?  I just got a question on reddit for astroturfing purposes! The documentation pointed me to this subreddit for more information. I suppose my question is: is this real gullible? Where can I find someone that thinks it wasn't staged?
I've heard of softballs before, but thought it was just play psychology, what can I actually do with this stuff? From what I've read so far, this stuff is free from any believability or truthfulness? How is that pandering?!

People desperately lying about Bitcoin in a desirable way in a subreddit that had adherents predict that [a BTC would be worth thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars, in 15 days' time]( and that's lowballing the estimates, in this thread [here]( (and in other predictions as listed [here](
That's unpossible!
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:32:19
This. [When BTC hit $1000 on MtGOX, people that said they had them were pumping them and not dumping them.]( Only people that were talking about them as non-owners were saying people should sell high.
"Bitcoins are worth real money." - I have a five figure sum in the bank, accrued after over a decade of saving by my wife and me. BTC is down 90% from just three weeks ago. We have savings because we'll need to pay the mortgage and all the other bills should either of us lose our jobs... if my savings were only worth 10% of their value at the start of the month, I'd be shitting bricks.

Hello, people I have never met because I'm in another country.
Some of you have lost a fortune, but know this: don't blame the people guarding the rabbit hole. But I'm going to talk about the media and pundits in disparaging terms; you know, the people that were urging caution all along. Sure, knock yourself out, blame them. But definitely don't blame the exchange that may have cost you everything from proper money to your cachet in ideological debates, 
and don't blame Bitcoin for existing so you could flush your cash away in this manner, 
and don't blame the (hang on, I have to use quotes) "bug" (which I'm putting in quotes because [even though Rupert Murdoch's press reported the thing]( because IT WAS MAGIC THE GATHERING THAT GAVE THEM THE STORY TO PRINT, it Totes McGoats isn't a thing, so don't trust MtGOX but don't blame them either).
Yours with love,
Someone that has no vested interest in pumping the value and validity of BTC in people's minds. Apart from the bits where he is the co-founder of the Bitcoin company Coinapult, worked as Director of Marketing at BitInstant, and was founder and partial owner of the Bitcoin gambling website SatoshiDice until he got out for more Bitcoins, millions of dollars in Bitcoins until the value went south like a Canada goose in winter, and now lives in Panama. Well away from you ~~rubes~~ soldiers of FREEDOM!!

You'd think, by now, they would wonder WHY it's so easy to pick holes in their arguments. 
Arguments where they have to invent scenarios that don't gel with reality. 
You know the scene in Se7en where Brad Pitt asks Kevin Spacey if he knew he was losing the plot slowly (or did he just notice it one morning as he was masturbating into his breakfast cereal)? It's like that. Do Bitcoin aficionados, do Dunning-Krugerrands, get an inkling they've put their money in something that attracts con men because it has no safeguards and it might not be the best idea in the world, or do they only notice it when their investments get wiped out in an avalanche of fraud on Mt.Gox, or flies away from their hive mind with Neo &amp;amp;amp;amp; Bee?
Do they stop and think "maybe everyone is bullshitting to make this look good, like I just had to. Oh shit, maybe this is a bad thing to be involved in"?
Considering their lack of empathy for others, and their wish to put this as the way people do business, I hope they don't. I seriously hope they all read this, think it's just a load of shit, and continue to think that things are great with Bitcoin. Riiight up to the point where some organized hacker group in Slovenia or Russia or wherever finds a way to clean out their wallets because they left their private keys in emails that can be accessed online. Or they install an app to manage their BTC that has a Trojan designed to search out those lovely piles of crypto. Or the exchange they has money in, or the servers the paper wallet company they used to print off hard copies of their stash, get hacked and cleaned out. Or the value just tanks and they're left with Internet money as useful as Zimbabwean dollars from 2008.

TIL the Weimar Republic, Argentina in the 1970s, Peru in the 1980s, and Zimbabwe a decade ago didn't have business infrastructure behind their currencies. No businesses totally invested in the currency in the hope it would remain [a reliable store of value.](

Well, Bitcoin holders. You've seen the moral integrity of the people you've allied with. And now you've seen the price of your crypto holding rise a little and slide a lot as people abandon the sinking ship like rats.
And when rats abandon **a sinking ship** ...well, you have to admit it. They DO have a very good reason for their actions, don't they.
So you have to ask yourself a few questions. With the backlog of unconfirmed transactions at a few blocks in size, any sudden sell-off could happen and you'd not be able to get out of the exit because of the mad rush that's already blocking your path. 
Someone could have caused the next slide already, like the one that [took it from $210 to $170 in the blink of an eye in the early hours of yesterday morning (US time zones)]( and the data just hasn't caught up yet.
