Thanks.   I'll say, this has been a pretty good little lesson though in miner fees.   
It's been coming on 72 hours, no confirm, and multibit somehow (or I did it) managed to rebroadcast so it's back up on blockchain.info.
I've been eyeballing using a double spend tool to re transmit with a higher fee, it's just, the whole thing seems kind of sketchy to me is all.
If anything, I've done me some learnin' through all this.

Thanks, checking out them now.
I guess at this point I need to accept it's not going to confirm and I need to let it age out.  What I don't know is if multibit rebroadcasts when I restart it or leave it running.

UPDATE:  As soon as I posted this, I went in and looked at the transaction (still showing not confirmed) in multibit, but looking at it on blockchain.info now shows it as:
*Transaction rejected by our node. Reason: Transaction was previously accepted but has been pruned from our database.*
I'm in the process of "reset blockchain and transactions" in multibit, but it's still showing there as unconfirmed, and on blockexplorer.com as a legit transaction still unconfirmed.
So......I have no idea what this means.   Has it aged out?   I'm kind of confused on how to read this.

Thanks.   Looking into it, but I'll wear the blame for this by having the fee too low.   What I can tell is it's timed out (48 hours) @ blockchain.info.
What I don't get is it's still showing on blockexplorer.com and in the multibit wallet.   Is it just a matter of relaxing, closing the wallet and letting it sit for a few days waiting for it to age out across the network??
