You cant predict the future and how far the bull run will go. Getting into bitcoin is a good idea, but whether getting in *right now* is hard to tell. The potential profits or losses also depend on how long are you willing to hold. I believe 100k is possible, but it can take years to get there. If you are going to do it, remember:
Don't invest more than you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is considered to be a high risk investment. 
Don't invest more than you can't afford to lose. Aka don't invest ALL of your savings, only a part of it.

Wealthy people have bodyguards for a reason.

Good job posting this cursed meme, look at what you've done
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:16:41
Haven't checked the price for 2 days and now seeing this... damn.

Welcome to crypto, where noone knows what's going on. The reality is, its Magic Internet Money.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:21:31


Expect it doesn't always stay stable, like during an economical crisis. Or if your country is under sanctions, its currency loses value, sometimes drastically. Every economy is a big bubble anyway, we still use it. 
Mass adoption of btc supposedly would stabilize the price enough for it to be used as a currency, not just to store value. Its not gonna happen overnight either, for a long time there will be both btc and normal currencies, btc will just be an option.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:48:51


There is no guarantee this will happen. For a long time it will most likely be both dollar and bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-15 09:34:32
I mean, if you have the money to more to a different country and know the language, sure. But that could be a problem for many.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:00:16
everything is temporary
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:14:38
Its back!

That doesnt mean its ok to scam people. There is 0 excuse for twitter to promote a scam.
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:17:16
drama is fun

Trolls are not scientists, they are trolls, they say its zero without building any model behind it. They just say it because they feel like it.
@_date: 2018-11-30 00:10:04
Maybe not the best idea to post this information on reddit.
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:36:09
Nice scam
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:33:41
Because they can be sued for promoting a fake Elon Musk account as a real thing.

The problem is that one company monopolizes the services, it can now control the whole market. Of course you can still use other companies, but since they are not as popular, you will never be able to compete with other people. So with making videos for example you are forced to do Youtube to make money, and your financial situation is under their full control if it's your primary source of income. You are at their mercy, and they can punish you if you have "wrong" opinions or even force you to say something you don't want to say. It's not as bad with coin exchanges, for the time at least. There is more choice and they have less leverage. But you can see where it will go.
@_date: 2019-01-24 00:02:53
Oh well. Good for him, lol.
@_date: 2019-01-12 12:44:41
They need to define "soon".

@_date: 2019-01-09 22:49:05
Ok, I want to know more about this.

McAfee is gonna lose his dick :(

Now seems like the best time to buy.

You say it like regime change will make it all magically go away, and NOT make it a million times worse.

Pretty sure Sargon of Akkad, who was banned from Patreon, is not a nazi.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:05:51
Cheap bitcoin yay
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:53:23
Probably just spam, report to reddit and twitter.
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:55:59
right now it's gaining speed
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:08:27
You can easily "clean" bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:45:24
That's why there is a rule: don't invest more than you can afford to lose. This isn't a nightmare for those who followed the rule. It's just a bear market. It will get better in a few years. Or won't. Still not a nightmare. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:05:44
Yes, because it's bitcoin and it's very unstable and constantly jumps up and down. It's been 3k several days ago, now it's 4k, and slowly growing, gaining steam.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:50:13
You mean 21 million Bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:25:49
You can buy any altcoin, then sell it back to BTC and there you go. It's cleaned. That's the easiest method, but not the only one. Look it up. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:54:27
It did the wrong thing.
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:33:13
That was clearly asking for consent, so it's not assault.
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:56:42
it will go up and down like it always does, but the amount it goes down will be less that the amount it goes up
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:44:46
Moon?
