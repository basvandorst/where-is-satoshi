Aloha old school terminals with a windows xp box acting as the server. 90% of the environments we walk into have this.

Uh... you still have to report those capital gains because they are realized during that transaction. If you dont, you could find yourself in trouble.

I've reached out to them before and asked them for some sort of integration with bitcoins... I'd like to see them integrate with Coinbase actually.
If anyone elses uses freshbooks, please take a moment and ask them to consider integration with some sort of bitcoin related processor... Thanks!
If all else fails, I need to leave freshbooks... they did a great job, but they're just not meeting my needs anymore as I'm finding new clients who are willing to pay my invoices in bitcoin.

I think supply is high due to liquidation to assets... which is a good thing... I think this is temporary as we get use to the flow now of bitcoins into commerce instead of a strict hording pattern.

Wow, looks beautiful... will definitely consider visiting for my next vacation!

JP Morgan the underwriter does not allow that account type. There is nothing wrong with becoming a voip provider. We've been an email provider for years and our new segment disqualifies us to move to quickbooks online (In our attempt to house all financials in one consolidated place)

Thanks, I guess I'll try them next.

What if the transaction is say $1000 usd... the client pays it in bitcoin, I hold them and they go up or down. Now the client does their accounting and says, I paid them 1000 usd... how do I match that record (or dont I) at the end of the year if I was to get audited.
Maybe these are questions for an accountant.

The clients I have want full touch POS systems, do they have anything like that?
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:41:17
Thanks! We should meet up, we're taking a careful approach to this since we know from marketing, that if you blow it the first time around, it's more difficult to integrate that client later even if the technology has become mainstream.

Uh... I have a real business, and you can call my phone number to verify... I'm a one man shop tho, so hopefully one person could verify, and I dont get 10k redditors calling my phone.

What do I do at the end of the year when I'm holding BTC and not USD and it comes time for taxes, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:43:29
Now that is pretty sweet!

Not the case. The machine I access all accounts from is a sandboxed OS used for no other types of use besides financial. Full security audits done regularly. Firewalled on inbound and outbound traffic, on the machine and at the router. Separate physical network as well from other devices, no wifi, no remote access, etc.
This is most definitely an external case of either spoofed emails, or password leak by btc-e
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:15:13
So if I need to pay my taxes in USD... and I cash out some of the BTC to USD to pay my taxes, am I also responsible for the capital gains/losses at the time of pulling money out exclusively to pay taxes?
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:49:57
I got the same ones... super scary... setup 2FA and they stopped and I no longer worry about it. I also setup 2FA on my email as well just in case.
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:04:30
I'm looking into that now.
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:01:33
Oh cool, thanks! I'll take a look at this tomorrow morning :)
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:53:08
Thanks, that sounds reasonable!

@_date: 2013-11-06 01:26:47
You cant end the story there...
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:05:06
But what about accounting? What do I do at the end of the year when I'm holding BTC and not USD?
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:59:10
But what if I dont want to convert to USD, how do I account for the changes in value of currency? Do I have to convert some to USD to pay taxes? Is there capital gains on top of that conversion if I convert back to USD?
