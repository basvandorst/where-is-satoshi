It happens.  I was banned on quite a few subs bc I was leaking out the secret of Bitquick.co while the mods of other subs kept referring people to LBC

Not a smart idea.  I've been part of the BTC revolution since 2009.  Not worth it
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:04:47
Not a lot of people trusted it

Yeppers.  Only way to get it tonight is thru a high taxing site.  To be honest with you, it wouldn't matter if you got your coin tonight or tomorrow because 99% of vendors don't even ship out til Monday

If only people had gotten into it when it first came out

all i know is this, LBC and Paxful are always high fees.  BTC ATM's are way high as well as Virwox.  Only reason I use Bitquick.co is not many people know about it, takes roughly 30 min to 3 hours at the most to receive your order and only 2% in fees.  You can also really only use Bitquick though when banks are open.  Also no ID verification

I would suggest waiting until tomorrow.  If you live in a big city that has banks open on Sundays, go on Bitquick.co and make an order and follow instructions.  Otherwise use LBC or Paxful and get charged out the yin yang

Does this site you mention support banks in USA?

Just use Bitquick.co they charge 2% in fees
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:24:29
Bitquick.co because coinbase is garbage.  Try uphold.com and also Gemini.com
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:48:24
4% is a lot.  The site I use is only 2% and the other day I spent 80 on btc and that 2% was $15 in fees
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:17:11
Bitcoin ATM's charge like 18% or something high like that

Nothing will ever replace a bank.  Crypto currency in a strange way is actually money laundering with zero rules and legal for the most part

@_date: 2018-02-16 19:52:24
Yep it always does
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:14:29
That's still a high rate
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:08:31
Haha wtf?  Chris Farley lol
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:42:29
Nobody has heard of Bitquick or used it?  Coinbase sucks
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:40:20
Bitquick.co ALL THE WAY
