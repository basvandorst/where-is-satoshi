Of course, even if it goes to $100 I'll keep them. 
I'm not an expert (I bought $50 in 2016 and $1k a few days ago) I think that the idea/technology is great, even if there are some struggles now (fees, time of processing a transaction, etc.) And has a good potential value, will see if it will recover some day.

Thanks mate! I appreciate!
Anyway I knew that I could lose this money, I wasn't counting on it. Don't understand me wro'g, I don't like to lose money, but that was a valuable experience.
Maybe I'll buy some more when it will do some double ultimate dip combo...
or not :)

Bought ~1k$ at $19,500, I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment.

I'm curious to know what would be the odds to generate a private key of the wallet where you accidentaly sent your bitcoin cash.

I don't have 2m to burn, sorry, only $1000 worth.

I think that we can go deeper, all the panic sells, mark manipulation, fud, etc. I most probably buy some more later.
Anyway, I always bought etf every months without giving a sh*t, but I never experienced such a loss!

Already subscribed. Anyway I already made some nice losses on the market 20-ish years ago. For now I'm only investing in ETFs.
Anyway WSB is a good source of quality memes.

Consider that as a tax for learning. Some people would say that it's more a tax for dumbness. I'd rather believe I learnt something...

We'll see, it may or not. Probably, maybe, we don't know or we would all be rich ! :)
