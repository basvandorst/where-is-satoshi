If you think it'll hit $1B USD in 100 years, then it's current price of $15k is a steal. Are you taking out loans to buy up as much as you can?
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:57:20
Wow, thanks u/GallowBoob, for shitposting this insightful content.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:08:44
Why not all three? You buy a game for BTC, then it plummets 30% and Steam is left holding the bag.

Arguing with someone who proves your points for you has that effect. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:17:39
What, pray tell, is the manifestation of foreclosure?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:22:20
Y'all are fucking dumb. Here's the fake account: 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:19:49
I haven't bought BTC in over 6 months. But don't worry, your unnecessarily snide comment doesn't further my point. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:24:07
With bulletproof steps like this, one has to wonder how we even got into the 2008 mortgage crisis. And correct, eviction. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:05:21
Just say "held" FFS. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:42:00
Yeah, that's entirely the problem. The culture of this sub values memes over discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:57:04
Yeah, BTC isn't working. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:50:18
I disagree the holidays are having any effect on BTC posts. I'm subbed to a fair number of ETH and BTC, and the shitposting is dramatically increased in the BTC community. Anecdotal, sure. But check yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:50:33
It's called dollar-cost averaging. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:44:30
Percentage losses would look similar - what is this supposed to mean?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:33:23
Let me know when life hits you. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:30:47
And why would anyone pay for anything in BTC/LTC when the market says it's for investing. There is a fundamental problem with crytpo right now that I haven't heard anyone address. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:31:59
Literally reread this chain. You complained that I was confused about eviction over foreclosure. I ask you what occurs during a foreclosure, your response: eviction. Do you smell burning toast?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:28:49
No, a crash is defined as any significant loss of value. Losing 1/4 of value in several hours would be considered a crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:51:37
There is zero nuance to your ridiculous position. I’m not even sure you’re aware of what your argument is. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:39:33
Really? Sounds like you don’t know how mortgage loans work. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:56:30
He put a lien on his house, so the mortgage lender secures the property rights until the terms are met. But you know what a mortgage loan is. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:40:44
So you’ve never heard of a mortgage loan?
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:19:55
This post and these comments read like folks who are new to investing. Looking back 6 years ago and chuckling about a sale? Pick and stock in the F500 from 2011 and you'll most likely get a similar result.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:34:18
This is 100% not how markets work. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:15:12
That's not a good thing. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:21:54
July, 2015 actually. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:45:15
If people like paying more for electricity than they'll get as a return on the altcoin, then sure. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:59:49
ETH a few years ago was worth like a buck, so not sure how it was worth it at the time. It only became worth it years later during the bubble (and now) if you held onto it, which it looks like you did. The difficulty back then was also incredibly low, so it looks like you made out pretty well. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:43:07
Even better!
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:01:54
Hey shithead, stop trying to intellectualize your hate. You're not that smart. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:46:28
Honestly who's using that machine. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:06:19
It's called smart given the value of cryptocurrency is absurdly speculative. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:04:01


You're a redditor, not a pioneer. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:16:07
So LN is just a pre-paid card? I hate pre-paid cards.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:49:00
Hollywood is knocking. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:30:50
Which "bitcoin" companies are you referring to?
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:34:22
Thanks Warren. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:13:12
This guy jerked off and BTC went up...you can't explain that!
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:07:56
Bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:19:33
We call this market capitulation. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:27:17
Sure, if it rises above those prices again.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:29:27
He was making fun of your awful tomato analogy, not complementing your critique. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:12:21
Did you forget to reply under the wrong account this time?
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:48:43
What? I can't hear you over the sound of hypocrisy.  
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:05:47
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:17:16
Lol Fuck Che Guevara. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:56:42
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:56:11
Annnddd it's gone. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:45:39
Make less sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:29:00
God I hope so 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:52:56
Jesus Christ. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:10:36
Are you wondering why your fake accounts aren't working?
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:55:10
Decentralized !== anonymous
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:54:29
We can go deeper:
`!!new Boolean(!(!!decentralized == !!anonymous))`
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:25:16
That's too bad. Before this comment, only he looked like a moron. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:48:35
You don't get irony, do you?
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:43:13
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:54:34
Oh that's right, you're the Vermontrer who made that terrible tomato analogy. How high were you when you wrote that?
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:41:05


lol keep me posted on your lawsuit.
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:20:37
Ew.
