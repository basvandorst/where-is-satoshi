Federal Reserve issues much more and without audits. As to Tether, it is likely used by "whales" as an instrument of convenience. There is no reason for Bitfinex to risk their very profitable business to non-backed printing of USDT.

Given that Bitcoin rose from 10k to about 20k in about a month, its current USD rate is enormously healthy. Apparently.

Don't you trade crypto relative to fiat? And why don't you measure your crypto based on how much material stuff or services you can get for it?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:15:00
The speculative mania actually speeds up adoption since it attracts more interest to the instrument. Segwit and bech32 are technologies. And average Joe doesn't want to get too deep into those details, he doesn't care. There should be some other attractive aspects besides the technology. Yes, the hype was a bit unhealthy, but it brought more interest to the crypto. And no, the growth before May of 2017 was relatively intense, just look not at absolute numbers but at charts.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:20:12
No I just want to have financial security, which means some nice significant savings. I don't need lambos even if I can afford them. What's the use of it? Attracting sluts? I have better use for my time. Can you drive it anywhere except on an autobahn (if you're in Germany) or on a race track? No. Maybe I'd get myself a nice car, such as a Maserati. But a lambo? Fuck that. Actually lambo dreams are cheap narcissist dreams. There's much better use of one's money. "Lambos" have become a vulgarity of narcissist delusional get rich quick lunatics.

Convincing about what? Unsubstantiated wet scary fantasies of hysterical pussies having a period? Sorry.
Think for a minute that a company like Bitfinex is hated by banks very much, and that is should be obvious to anyone who wasn't born yesterday. Now imagine there exists a virtual currency pegged to US dollar, or any other virtual / crypto currency for that matter. Now imagine how much Bitfinex would be accepted by banks, and what would be the reason for Bitfinex to invent Tether in the first place - right, the hate of banks. Now imagine the requirements of auditors when this kind of balances is involved, and their conservative requirements for banking. Again, just use some reason.
Now also think about how this is all relevant to the price of Bitcoin, and why Tether would have been used to pump the price of Bitcoin. I don't see a good reason to think it was the case, but I see good reason why Tether is a convenient tool for many - those doing arbitrage among many others.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:16:03
It is a pure worthless assumption that Tether is not backed by real USD. Any proof of that?

I don't care much about Tether, since I don't think it has much influence on the price of crypto. The idea that Tether was used to pump Bitcoin is nonsense, comes out of thin air, and has no real foundation other than fantasies of hysterical sissies.
Yes, the hysterical sissy fear that Tether can somehow harm Bitcoin can bring the price of Bitcoin even further down. But, again, this is all hysterical sissy FUD, nothing more.

People will still buy what they need - i.e. food, shelter, clothing, education, medicines, cars, etc. They will just resist the temptation of buying what they don't need. And that's absolutely normal - this is actually _healthy_ for the economy, the environment, and basically for everyone. Well, maybe except for some companies that want to sell more stuff that is unnecessary for many people. When people think twice before buying an item, what can be better for the economy in the long run? Absolutely.
Also, how does limited supply of gold cause hyperdeflation? By your logic limited supply of anything should create deflation. But in nature, there is no unlimited supply of anything. Thus, naturally, anything of value must be in limited supply.


I hope you are not trying to say that the Great Depression was caused by money hoarding.


Those who were hoarding obviously became richer by 30%. Those who didn't have savings didn't become richer.


However, multiplying dollars 2x (or how many times was the dollar multiplied since 2008, for example?) doesn't make anyone wealthier, obviously. So if you destroyed half the dollars, you'd get closer to the value of dollar it was before the so called QEII (which is just plain fraud, by any reasonable definition).

Most people are not in just for the technology. You can't be "just" for the technology if you're seriously (relative to you) invested in it. Money is not free. If you had bought Bitcoin for $10 a coin some time ago, you might be "mostly" for technology, but even then, make no mistake, you can't be in crypto "just" for the technology.
For myself, I'm in for both - money and technology. I do not believe that there are some people who are considerably invested in crypto and don't care about fiat price movements. This is bullshit.
However, I don't give a shit about lambos.

This is stupid FUD from nowhere. Read here 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:29:20


No. I was replying to your comment in which you basically said that if people hoard money they do not consume "enough", which is bad for economy. This is apparently flawed.


Why? Gold is in limited supply - yes. But the price of gold can go higher and higher to match the limitedness of the supply. What's the problem with that?


If the money goes up in value then one's savings go up in value. This makes people richer. Richer people = better economy. When people throw their money on unnecessary stuff, this causes overconsumption. This is bad for the economy in the long term. Less savings &lt;-&gt; poorer people &lt;-&gt; unnecessary consumption &lt;-&gt; worse economy. And also more debt.

What you're saying is that you don't care much about how much resources you've got behind your bitcoins, but, rather, how many bitcoins you've got. But this sounds a bit absurd.

This is seriously lunatic/delusional, like most of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:09:55

But do we trust Bitcoin as a store of value if it goes down by 50% in a matter of a couple of weeks? If you are a monk who doesn't need much then yes, you're just a technology enthusiast. Or if you just keep 5% in Bitcoin - sure, you don't care about its fiat value, it's just your occasional hobby.
My point is this sort of posts is delusional. Most posters here must actually be delusional and/or plain mentally sick.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:18:34
Right, if you only invested 5% of your capital you don't care. But if BTC goes down to $2k a lot of people will get devastated. Ideology is fine, but not when it reaches the level of fanaticism. If BTC goes down to $2k people will stay away. Why? Because there's such a thing as money necessary for living, earned by work.

What you call mania didn't just begin out of thin air, there were fundamental reasons for that. Wider adoption, wider realization and understanding of what crypto can bring to the table. The main changing fundamental behind the price increase is wider adoption and wider recognition. Nothing just happens for no reason. But yes, the price had to undergo a serious correction, since it had been rising too quickly.

The fee issues aren't really issues. What was brought up by the BCH shills was a non-reason. Litecoin had already existed before BCH came, and Litecoin had already had everything BCH had to offer, except that it didn't have the name "Bitcoin". The "fee issue" disappears when the network is not being spammed. When it's not spammed by BCH shills, one can send bitcoin at 100-150 sat/Kb with relatively fast confirmation. Also, Ethereum already has everything for cheaper transactions. Monero as well, and there are faster and lighter coins than BCH. BCH is a scam built by a group of narcissistic individuals wanting to become Bitcoin and take all its fame. But while no one knows who Satoshi is, because BTC is truly decentralized, everyone knows (with enough easy insight) that BCH is a pump-n-dump shitcoin.

What you're saying is that if there's no constant overconsuption the economy is going to be hurt. But then such an economy is flawed. People should be able to hoard and consume only as much as they _need_, not as much as they are driven to consume by advertisements. Overconsumption is bad economy. If unnecessary consumption makes an economy suffer, such an economy (based on such a model) is unnecessary itself. Sustainable consumption is healthy economy. What is taught today at universities in economics departments is far from real science, but closer to nonsensical absurdity.

Your comparison is inappropriate. You're trying to compare apples to oranges. Makes no sense. Use some reason please.


My main points are that
1. There is no good reason to panic because Tether might be (but might NOT be as well) involved in fraud.
