Any sources for this? Sounds very conspiracy theory-esque..

That’s called inflation.  If it wasn’t for inflation, any loan you have ever taken out would be paid back with money worth increasingly more, effectively increasing your interest rate.  I’m sure you’d rather that in fiat?

Gold is actually quite divisible - that’s one of the many properties it has that makes it valuable.  Also, gold is used in most computers so you are using gold when you transact or mine bitcoin :)

I think your view is inherently biased, but to each their own. Great chatting with you!

What you are describing would have the same issues as using to the gold standard.  This was tried and resulting in capital being extremely concentrated into the hands of a few individuals (trusts/corps) in the 1880-1920s.  The interest rate you describe is far too low, as it would have to at minimum make up for population changes.  If it doesn’t, you end up with more and more people fighting for a fixed amount of currency.  BTC having a finite supply is what drives this (similar to gold).

Understood 100%.  I know I am biased in my own right as well!

.. except it isn’t a currency.  It’s legally considered an asset similar to a commodity.

Great point !

Too bad bitcoin isn't a currency... its an "asset"

Except it isn’t.  It’s not even anonymous...
Edit:  I’m hoping I missed your /s

Except owning a stock gives you ownership rights to a company, and in some cases, even voting rights!  That has value. Bitcoin gives you.. ownership rights to a string of letters and numbers ?

Coin star is owned by a holdings company called Aspen Parent, Inc. which was incorporated in 2016 in WA.  I smell big tech money.
