I agree. And the funny thing to me is when I try to explain it to people I just say fuck it, if they don't see the future why should I try to convince them. They will see sooner or later.

Yikes how bout now still small potatoes "in a big bag" lol
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:42:59
So if we arent going to see anything below 6k, why would I buy at $10300?  I will wait until it gets to $6001 to buy more, that way i will get more instead of buying at $10300. lol
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:45:33
hope you didnt fall asleep holding the bag.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:33:59
Lol I seen it on a long time ago, so I had to look it up I guess it serves a purpose actually.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:10:28
But just as people are accumulating you also have people taking profits. So it depends on how many buyers and sellers. The more buyers than seller prices goes up, the more sellers than buyers price g ou e down.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:36:51
That's the thing with bitcoin. The market cant be saturated. That's why when prices go down you get more bitcoin than if the prices was higher (discount). Its not like fiat, fiat the more people that have it the less valuable it becomes. Dont believe me ask people in Venezuela 10,000,000% inflation.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:40:19
I would suggest buy every time it goes down, at a price you feel comfortable at. Because you stated "I'm expecting it to go back up" so that's a now brainer. But never sell for a loss
@_date: 2019-07-01 01:44:04
Accumulate, its not rocket science.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:31:22
I do the lower it goes the more I buy.
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:36:54
Its dipping as we speak.
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:47:38
I would hold until the prices goes higher than the price you bought in at. Never sell in a bull market.

Bitcoin is going to $8500. If I am wrong let me know. This is not TA I just understand btc price swings. And the ath is $19500 for this year.

So why does china have a strong economy? Because they have a high demand for goods. Supply and demand is what keeps an economy going. You can produce a ton of goods but if the demand isnt there then what. Your left with an economy. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 00:22:54
Your only as strong as your weakest hand. So basically you have to weak hands.
@_date: 2018-09-08 01:16:28
I remeber when BTC was up and I would come here for quality advice and trust me I learned a few good things. But now its just a bunch of people arguing about opinions. You cant say someone opinion is wrong lol. Thats what they believe or how the feel. Instead of arguing try to get an understanding why that person feels that way, maybe you will learn something. Because this shit is hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 02:48:53
The dollar wont fall because it is valuable. What makes the dollar valuable? Demand. How do they create demand? Inflation. So until bitcoin is demanded it wont be valuable.
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:12:18
Wrong, from here to 20k isn't bubble territory, but anything else is. So from here to 100k is definitely bubble territory.
@_date: 2018-09-07 01:47:25
My new saying if your not buying your lying. So if I ask someone are you buying btc and they say no. Either they don't believe btc is the future and they are just in it for who mknows, or they are embarresed to say they bought btc.  bought some. # Buy da dips.
@_date: 2019-07-27 04:55:45
What I have noticed about TA is they play both sides of the field. They say bitcoin is going to go up but if this and this happens then bitcoin is going to go down. So basically they leave themselves open to be right. And like I say even a broken clock is right twice a day.
@_date: 2018-09-09 02:29:17
Is that what they told you have you seen are gold supply. Lol we aint got none.
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:33:52
Well I use Poloniex, and when people margin trade they need coins to borrow, so that's were I come in. You get a percentage of what the rate is. recently I bought doge coin and was earning 1.2%. But that's in doge and not btc, btc will be lower but you still make a slow steady profit.
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:17:35
Might be chicken or hen.
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:58:49

Well Thoroughly researching an asset, perceiving it may have long term value and buying a reasonable allocation in a diversified set of investments is not hoping for a miracle. That's making a calculated bet on the success of an asset. 
Is not the same thing as putting your money in and hoping for a miracle.

Every country has an economy, and how in the hell does the economy get stronger? O wait the just push the strong economy button and wala now we have a strong economy. Well I will be sure to let the people in Venezuela know about your strong economy button.

An economy still needs demand, so no matter how you look at it demand makes the dollar valuable.

Do be shocked when it spikes past 100k.
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:29:21
Thats what Im saying. Thats why it doesnt bother me when people say the market is crashing. The reason its crashing is because it is being manipulated.

Every time an exchange gets hacked, just tell uncle same you had some coins in that exchange. It will put an end to corrupt exchanges.
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:00:56
Well I have had not problem with Poloniex, But I did lose my money to Lakebtc, and almost lost my coins on binance. So I suggest to us an exchange that is in your country. Me Bittrex and Poloniex.
@_date: 2018-09-11 03:36:27
Big rig miners wont hit a point where mining becomes unprofitable. They started early. Thats like saying whales will stop buying bitcoin when it becomes unprofitable, they also started early.
@_date: 2018-09-09 02:34:52
Bitcoin must be down. Lol relax and buy more thats what I do. And if I lose all my savings hey at least I tried.  regrets  what if's  you booboo  is the future
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:28:23
I have use [cex.io]( but my bank blocked them. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:34:24
Yeah. On the moon.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:13:43
Yea but you have to look at it like this. If whales hold the majority of Bitcoin and there are only 21 million. When it comes down to purchasing items like million dollar homes and cars they will have to use the majority of their coins depending on the price. So in order for bitcoin to be useful the price of bitcoin will have to increase tremendously. Think about the guy who used thousands of btc to buy pizza, and how things are different today. So as more people adopt bitcoin the more valuable it becomes. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:28:27
Because people will take profits leading to more taxes for the government.
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:22:11
No, when your  account gets hacked with 2FA enabled.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:26:20
But if your just holding why does halving even matter. Your just going to hodl yourself through it.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:58:33
You make more or lose more daily than a normal bank account. I make $7 A day loaning out coins. Seems like nothing but I don't get those returns from a bank.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:27:10
But it gives you a starting point to base your theories on.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:52:55
Well like I said in order for bitcoin to be valuable their needs to be a demand for it. Thats why the dollar wont fall because there is a demand for it. Who cause economic problems? Banks and Governments. So if bitcoin eliminates those two then the economic problem is solved. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 03:18:00
Binance system got hacked and couldnt access my coins but they fixed it, and the same thing with lakebtc, but I am still trying to withdraw my coins. So I would use exchanges in your respective country. That way if something does happen you have a little chance.
@_date: 2018-09-04 08:18:22
Well your friends are idiots. If they are willing to invest in something only if it's worth mire than it's currently worth, then they don't know how to invest. "I'm invest in that stick but only if it passes 100k". From 7000 to 60k is a 53k profit, and 60k to 100k is 40k profit, and 7k to 100k is a 93k profit. Lol hope you dont filler your friends advice.
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:02:15
I disagree, not because I don't think we will but because when ever I  say or do something the opposite always happens.
@_date: 2018-09-11 04:09:09
yea let me get in my time machine and get it off my brain phone. LOL
@_date: 2018-09-07 01:53:01
You guys need to learn how to make BTC and other coins work for you. Instead of just putting your money in and hoping for a miracle. I hope btc goes up and I hope it goes down. Dont be afraid to make your own choices, educate yourself but at the end you make the moves and live with the outcome.
@_date: 2018-09-08 02:51:20
Yea but why hassle with many currency's. That like if every state in the US had different currencies what a disaster that would be.
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:59:24
$8000 is a key number, so until then relax.
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:57:18
Reminds me of the beginning of August.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:24:01
The reason why the price is dropping is so whales can accumulate as much btc as possible. And then they put sale orders and when people stop buying they increase the price to bring in the new bag holders. Then when no more bag holders are willing to play they drop the price to bring in the "buy the dip" guys or gals. Then when all the "dip guys and gals" are not willing to play they then lower the price to "shake out the weak hands" ( accumulate more coins for cheap). When the hodlers are the only ones left then you see the price increase. Whales don't hodl if they did we all would be whales.
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:42:46
Lol we said the same thing just different ways.
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:15:03
2009,2013,2017. 2021 is the next bull run so sit back increase your holdings and enjoy the craziness that we are about to witness. When btc hit ath in previous years it took time to get back and surpass the previous ath. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:16:58
So your saying in two years its going to go back up? So why stop buying now? Or why start selling now?
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:32:52
Im going all in. You better be right.

Lol I paid my barber with bitcoin. But I was embarrassed because he didn't receive the payment right away. So I do believe I lost his interest in btc. I believe in the technology but some people are comfortable with the ways things are. So for now people want fast transactions and unfortunately bitcoin doesn't offer that.
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:08:27
well my longs a re being rekt in alts, so I guess bitcoin evens it self out

That my point so imagine if Bitcoin changes everything for them, and they figure how to use bitcoin to make it work. Everyone else will follow.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:37:48
when a bank make you keep a minimum deposit in your accout that is a fee just because they dont take it from you they are still holding that minimum.

Here is  a new challenge called the Bitcoin challenge. If you think the price of BTC will go up in the future buy and if you believe the price will crash in the future sell. Why are we criticizing each others difference of opinions. Nobody knows. You may have an idea but it isn't for sure. Let discuss how we can make BTC useful and more accepted among our peers.
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:14:35
Well some people us USD for drugs and legal things as well. What are you saying.
@_date: 2018-08-30 21:55:30
To me Venezuela is headed in the right direction. If they can pull it off and show btc can function as a currency, you will have wished you bought btc. Let's Go Venezuela pave the way.
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:25:43
You sound like some one who is invested in it but still talk bad about it. I bet you go to the casino and put your chips on red and black. Lol. Have you ever tried to buy something with bitcoin, the concept behind it will catch on its awesome, yeah it needs some upgrades but its new technology.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:05:49
you pay taxes on the profit. So what you bought and sold at. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:00:29
Yea but your here for financial advice lol.
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:13:26
Well thats like saying people aren't going to buy because prices are down, or people aren't going to buy because the prices are to high. Some people have different agendas. The less people that are mining the less difficulty. Some people may be trying to get as many bitcoin no matter the cost because they know the potential it has to be in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:15:01
bitcoin will be usable, but it will never be a currency, just like gold is not a currency checks or debit cards will never be a currency but bitcoin will be another form of payment.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:06:46
Zimbabwe dollars lol
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:28:57
Well with bitcoin I am my own bank, and if you take the money away from the government they have nothing, Middle east have armies and police but are nothing because they have no power which comes in the form of money. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:40:45
So printing more money is a bad thing for us? Right
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:44:19
O I forgot to mention debit cards were introduced in 1960 but didnt really take off until the 1990's. Thats 30 years. So btc and fellow crypto's have 22 years to get it together.
@_date: 2018-08-31 03:32:52
So you just waste your time predicting the price of bitcoin and you are correct most of the time???You just gave me an Idea. I am going to post the winning lotto numbers  before they are picked to show you guys that I have them figured out. LOL
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:39:05
The reason why they cant see it is because they are waiting for the banks and government to say crypot is the future. Until then people will continue to pay the banks every pay check they make, then the bank will let you borrow your money when you need it.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:12:24
So how much are we up since last year and the year before and the year before that, better yet how much are we up since 2009. So your statistics mean nothing when you dont show the whole picture.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:14:35
they do its called McDonald's 
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:57:41
Yes you can. So when they came out with steam powered engines were they trying to reinvent the wheel? No. They were taking something and making it better. Or when they created electric motor they are not trying to re invent the wheel. Have you used a debit card in Iraq or the middle east. Good luck. So crypto is bigger than your everday purchases at your local stores. And whether you like it or not crypto is the future. So you can invest while you can or you can sit back and predict the future the choice is yours.
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:22:16
From my experience mining is good but it does require alot of your time. Because I didnt know anything about mining so I was always checking the equipment. And one day I got a flashing red light didnt know what it meant. So I had a bitcoin shop in Colorado fix it and I sold my antminer s9 for the same price I bought it for. And just invetsed the money from that into btc. My thing was mining btc you are paying about 350 a month in electricity, so I just invest 350 a month in btc. But if you have the time and the room for the equiptment mine. But let me tell you those antminers are loud.
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:03:28
Lol there wont be any dominating currency. Any country that has currency  will back bitcoin. Thats what I dont get when people say bitcoin isnt backed by anything. Well neither is your debit card. Your debit card isnt backed by the Government. Crypto isnt a currency it is another form of payment.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:01:09
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:27:14
well good for you. not everybody is a premium customer.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:53:24
And when there are no more people to buy the dips, that is when the price will start to increase.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:42:02
Alright bitcoin is about 9 years old. Debit cards have been around since 1966 and there are some countries that don't accept them. So in 2008 when btc came out how much was it worth. And how much is it worth now. Bitcoin is here to stay when the tulip bubble popped the price didnt go back up or increase a bit.
When the perfect bitcoin is created "any coin" that gives us everything we are expecting then that's when you will see mass adoption. Right now we are in the trail and error stages trying to figure out what works.
I got into bitcoin last year heard about it when it was $700 we I got verified the price was $2000. I bought in and held through the forks. I could of panic but educated myself and thanks to my fellow Bitcoiners they taught me how to Hodl. And when it hit $20000 I took my initial investment. Then I started trying to find ways to use btc in my everyday life.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:18:48
wow heard this song on pandora this morning. Made my day. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:33:15
Lol tell me how long you can have a bank account with no money in it before they close it. Yea USAA is different because they are dealing with military personnel and families who are retired or active so they are making money of those disability checks, and GI bill checks, and deployment checks that you are depositing so of course they aren't going to have a minimum balance. Lets see we can charge this guy a $15 minimum balance or give him a free account so he can deposit those disability and benefit, checks every month. Lol the more money you deposit into a bank the more money they make. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:50:34
Bitcoin is the future. I dont care what anyone says. If you look at the way we communicate with each other it has changed over the years. Even how we get information, and how we listen to music, so why is the way we pay for things going to stay the same forever? Its not. I have noticed when people dont understand how something works they say its a scam. But how is being in control of your finances a scam. Its not. So if you are invested in bitcoin for the tech or to get rich well this is your chance to buy more, and if you are looking for the price to go up so you can break even just sell now and save yourself the heartache.  the dips  is the future.
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:42:11
Dont forget you have to pay taxes on the interest gained, also the banks charge you a fee to use your money.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:58:28
Btc makes people contradict ourselves. Me for example I hope the price goes up so I can see my investment make a profit. But also hope the price drops so I can buy more coins. Other people invest in btc but then say btc is a scam. lol The one that gets me are the ones who are invested but when the price is dropping they sell, and then when the price starts to go up they buy back in. WTF Lol Anybody else wanna chime in with some contradicting stories.
@_date: 2019-03-01 04:28:56
Instead of waiting for someone to post past year performance, why dont you do the research and enlighten us. Give back, be proactive.

Hopefully your not related to those guys who said the internet will never have widespread adoption. But if you educate yourself, you will see the world is changing from the way we shop to the way we eat. Everything is becoming more and more digital using that same technology naysayers said would fail (the internet). If you look at all technology that has improved our lives started out slow, some almost didnt make it but it did. So i look at btc the same way it might take a while but we will get there.
@_date: 2019-03-01 04:31:41
They already did but they used Venezuelan bolívar.I think they purchased 2 doge coins.
@_date: 2018-10-13 01:12:21
No prob. why would the price increase this year what new has happened to btc to make it a must have.? Nothing. Dont get addicted to maken moeny off bitcoin, get addicted to accumulating as much btc as you can possibly can. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:54:40
Everything is a joke lifes a joke. WHy sit around and cry about it get in or stay out. Cry because the price goes up to fast cry because the price is to low. WTF. Stocks are crashing BTC is a joke. Like I said everything is a joke.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:51:45
Because they want me to buy more at a discounted rate.
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:19:17
2020, so accumulate now because when it gets to 20k you are going to ask when is the next dip so you can buy in.
@_date: 2018-10-12 03:27:36
I think they are still tyring to shake out the weak hands. So i think we will see this pattern for a while. We might see a run but I dont think ath run. IMO
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:55:32
Whales are bored and need more money.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:43:03
No, but if I did I would have bought a ton of BTC in 2009.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:16:14
The only way they can shake you empty is if you sell.When You sell You lose your Btc and money.
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:22:31
Lol thats why I said God.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:43:50
Its called sticking to your guns. If your gonna play a game you cant quit because you are losing, and if you do lose learn from your mistakes so you can win next time. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:15:16
agree. I believe in crypto, I do everything I can to spread the word. Its more than a get rich quick scam. Its the future.
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:59:24
So a whale rather sell at $7500 than $20000 how does that make sense. whales buy and sell. They buy low sell high. The average joe buys high and sells low thats how they make money. So from 20k to 7K i'd say were low and I am going to buy until it hit Zero. Note to self as long as whales own btc you are in good hands. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:37:50
Thats why I said you learn from your mistakes, Thats why I dont go to the casino anymore i play bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:43:14
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:09:35
So what about $9999.99 what does you anal list say
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:51:46








@_date: 2018-06-10 20:33:58
Fragements, because if the price goes down then you could of got more at a better price. So I would set a time on when to purchase and not a price. Because if you put a price to buy at you may be waiting a while. I put $50 in a week no matter the price.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:19:55
But thats the thing you may say let me cut my loses and sell then a few minutes or days later it goes up a $1000 and you say I think btc has recovered and you buy back in then btc goes down $200. There is never a right time to sell.
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:22:24
I think its funny reading people's opinion on why the price of bitcoin is so low or why it was so high. Well here is my opinion on why the price was high. The price was high because people seen an opportunity to make huge profits on their investments so everyone wanted in and that drove the price up and the earlier you got in the higher your profit.
The price is low because people wanted to cut their losses, and others don't want anything to do with bitcoin because they feel it is a scam. And all this TA and charts are just for show nobody know shit about this they can say they do but even a broke clock is right 8.33&amp; of the time. So until the next big craze if you want to make money off bitcoin you better learn how to day trade and if your in it for the long haul then hodl.

Not true.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:24:15
Your strategy is all wrong. Your strategy should be to own 1,2,3 however many bitcoin you can afford with out going broke. So if you think about it, and put $50 a week for 10 years that's $24,000 dollars saved or $48,000 in twenty years. So its a win win. But in order to profit off of bitcoin you need to have as many as you can afford, so if your watching the price you will lose in the end but if you set a goal to own bitcoin you will be well off.

 In March of 2009, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner let it slip that he was "quite open" to the idea of an eventual move toward a global currency run by the International Monetary Fund. Although many were surprised by this unusual announcement, the idea of a world currency is certainly not a new one. In fact, one of the most frequently cited backers of a single currency is the legendary economist John Maynard Keynes.

Nope your actually early. Welcome to the party.

People are funny they claim they understand btc and in reality they dont. Imagine an auctioneer is looking in your window and without you noticing he is listen to your conversation and hear you say how much you value a photo and you are willing to pay anything for it. So that auctioneer tells his buddy "hey this guy likes this photo and is willing to pay top dollar for it". 
So they start the auction with the picture already over priced and they see you put your bid in, now they know you are willing to pay anything so one auctioneer acts as a bidder and is always bidding higher than you until they feel you are losing interest then they sell you the over priced painting.
So whales do the same thing they look at all the shorts and long and they manipulate the price so it goes up and people lose their "shorts", and when people see the price going up they start buying in, and they start putting long positions. 
I bet if we stop betting on bitcoin it would skyrocket because everybody would benefit from the price increase, but when we margin trade some benefit on the price to be low and some high, so until then Im buying the dips. Its not the whales that is hurting bitcoin it MARGIN TRADING.

I dont think they have to actually sell coins to manipulate the matket. They put in buy and sell orders which raises or lowers the price of btc. I think. But us little people are trying to get rich quick thats why and how the whales are able to manipulate the market.

But you make no sense if they pumped the price all the way to $20,000 why would they sell at $7,500. The time to buy is when the whales buy (which is now) and the time to sell is when the whales sell. Its not hard. Don't be fooled. A "Whale" is the same as bank they are in the business of making money.

 So if I got into BTC because I thought it was a good investment and the price is down what am I supposed to rant about?? How bad the technology sucks?? How the owners at the local gas station refuse to accept it as a form of payment because of the volatility? Or should I rant about how I was trying to convince my barber to accept bitcoin as a new form of payment and paid him with bitcoin for a haircut, which in turn took him 3 hours to receive payment, or how bout I rant about how when he did receive payment he could not withdraw the money into his bank account because it would have cost him more in fees then what he had.

You cant base your predictions off trends, if that were the case President George W. Bush should have died in off based oh the   **Curse of Tippecanoe, "**  For the next 120 years until 1960, presidents elected during years ending in a zero (occurring every twenty years) died while serving in office, from Harrison to [John F. Kennedy]( (elected 1960, died 1963). In addition, two losing candidates from election years ending in zero, namely [Stephen A. Douglas]( who lost in 1860, and [Wendell Willkie]( who lost in 1940, would die before the next presidential election occurred, meaning that had they been elected, they too would have become victims of the curse." History doesnt always repeat itself.

You got it if you think btc will go down you short if you think its going up you go long. How much return you get is based on how much you put in. Its easy to do but I would do it because you will lose money. As soon as you go long the price will drop, and as soon as you go short the price will increase good luck.

It doesn't matter what products get launched if the price is manipulated on how the market is feeling products mean nothing. Last year the whales made there money off new money, but this year is different there is no new money hence the low volume, so the whales are making money off margin trades, and if we stop margin trading we all win but until then the whales win always. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:09:05

Ok guy's say the market is being manipulated by whale. Let me ask you a question, when the price of btc drop do they lose money? Yes. So why would they want the price to drop? So they can attain more btc. So when the price drops whales lose money just like the rest of us, but the buy up the coin everyone else is selling. So if you wanna be a whale you have to think like a whale. Buy,Buy,Buy.
@_date: 2018-06-27 23:17:02
They sould make it easier for the rest of us. They should have a bear coin and a whale coin and whatever coin is doing good it should reflect how bitcoin is doing. That would eliminate everybody's analysis. Bear coins are selling like hot cakes, buy more bitcoin that easy.

I understand that, but it was awkward trying to get someone to accept bitcoin and in order to do so they have to jump through hoops to get set up then when they finally get all set up they have to wait to receive their payment. So imagine if it was a random barber and I was trying to pay with bitcoin I would not have been able to leave until the barber had gotten the payment.

Your right it's a sucker rally, people waiting for the the price to drop and when they realise the price is slowly climbing that's when they will buy in and you will see the price correct and the will get scared and sell (sucker).
@_date: 2019-04-06 00:10:46
Just wanted to give some advice to noobs. Do your own research because when the price of btc is going up everyone will look like a genius and that they know what they are talking about. But when the price drops you will see nobody knows what they are talking about I mean nobody. So do your research find what strategy works for you and have fun. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:01:07
And that's why most people dont like btc. Because it won't go away like the critics say it will. So instead of jumping on board with the rest of us they just fight reality. Btc is  here to stay.

People are arrogant when they say bitcoin is dead. I get it you dont believe in the technology or understand it existence, but BTC is not dead. We dont even know how to store btc without it being stolen, we dont know how to use it without screwing something up. Imagine giving someone that had been incarcerated for the last 50 years a smart phone. They would have the same reaction and say the internet is stupid and it has no place in the future. But when they finally realize how to use it they will say its the best thing ever. So the same applies to BTC, we need to learn how to use it.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:53:04
You have lots of learning to do. I put money in every week so if last week it was 6k and now this week its 4k, would you call that losing money? I would but you have to educate yourself on ways you can benefit from btc taking a dip.

When the price went from 1000 to 20000 how many people were invested and how long did the price stay around 1000 or below.

Invested that into btc which was around 1700 and invested every payday total was 3k. Then BTC ran up to 20k and I sold on the way down at 17k. But I lost money during this time but its part of the game. Whatever got you interested in btc you should focus on that and if that interest is no longer there you should find another hobby.  luck

If you are invested in cryto for the long haul or day trade this is the perfect time to buy. I bought in last year when it went from 700 to 2000 at the start of last year. Was a newbie buy low sell high. But I realized what BTC is about I stuck it out and took some profits at 17000. Now I am buying and hodling, I understand the game so if you are a newbie buy and hodl this is the best time to invest and you will see home unstopable this crypto stuff is.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:28:31
I get what you are saying but but its wrong. More adoption will not make it less volatile, and it does'nt matter how volatile it is people invest in what they think they know about. If less volatility had anything to do with it everyone would take their money out an put it into a savings account and earn .00001% a year. The problem is transactions, right now BTC cant compete with the banks and thats whats hurting it. Another problem is people dont know what they are getting into when they get involved with crypto's and when they see those big ass dips they get scared and leave. But your in the ball park, just playing the wrong game. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:39:09
You are always going to leave money on the table. The problem is you are in it for money but hoping btc goes up. Like I said before there are more ways to make money with btc, just gotta figure it out.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:56:04
Well thats why Bitcoin and crypto will be valuable because right now people dont see the need to seperate themselves from the banks but in the future when the shit hits the fans people will realize crypto is the best bet. So us early investors are buying dips and selling high and stressing for no reason. Bitcoin is the future.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:27:38
Also doing the speed limit is safe but sometime you want to go faster to get an adrenaline rush. What im trying to say is different stroke for different folks. You play it safe others feel btc and crypto is playing it safe as opposed to stocks. Some people believe playing the lottery is safer than investing it stocks or btc, are they wrong? No. Why? Because that is there opinion. So let me enjoy my roller coaster ride. Thanks
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:44:01
Look at bitcoin as a house. Say you buy a house, when the housing market crashes do you sell your house lol no you hodl on for the ride.  on tight
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:52:54
Lol answer this do you own any beanie babies. I you do some of them are going for 5,000- 75000. So thats a bad example because what you have just pointed out is bitcoin is going to be worth way more in the future than what I bought if for. Thanks for the encouragement 
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:40:10
Had to upvote.
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:03:12
But would you give the same statement to a person who got in at 1200 and sold at 18k. If you can get bitcoin at a discount get it take advantage of the opportunity. Even if you bought in at 7k if you buy now you still can make a profit.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:50:33
You have it backwards, I was selling when the prices was going up. Man that explains why your losing money. When the price was going up I was selling, now the price is going down Im buying. When the price was going up you were buying now the price is falling your selling to minimize your loses. Well lets put it like this you have already lost most of your money you might as well hodl on to your coins.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:40:05
Pretty much. Look every time it goes down people start crying and start to panic. So you can say you know whats going on but in all reality your guess is just as good as the next. O and the dumbmest investment advice is HODL. Bought bitcoin when it was $10000 and it ATH at $100,000 and corrected back to $5000. But I hodled lol yea dumb advice.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:13:35
Technology. Technology is the new gold so invest while you have a chance. I been in crypto for a little more than a year. Now ask yourself what is yoyr debit card and bank account backed by???? Technology.
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:46:44
I would pay him the 200, and keep the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:19:03
I think its funny people will buy bitcoin when it is at an all time high but when its low they say bitcoin is a scam. Lol If your going to go in then stay committed. So the lower the price the better. Buy more, But never invest more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:32:24
If you sell now then you lose. If your going to buy back in a few days then you should just buy as it goes down instead of trying to time the market, Because as soon as you sell the price is goin to rise and then you will buy back in and thats when the price will start to decrease. Lol So can you please sell so the price can go up.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:24:39
Not really because I know what profits I have made and I understand the idea behind bitcoin. Its people like them that are waiting for the government to say "ok crypto's are safe to invest in." Well by then it will be way to late. Because when everything goes away from money then people with crypto will have a head start. Mark my words everything evolves even money. And banks were never supposed to be in charge a our finances but we let them, so now its time to gain back the power.
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:14:10
Has anyone received there 1099-K and if so what good advice do you guys have on filing taxes. Lol I just received mine and I wish I made that kind of money, but now I have to pay taxes on money I didn't make. Any advice. Thanks
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:03:08
The reason why you dont see mass panic is because we realize btc Always comes back up and when he does you better hodl on to your undies because it will be bigger and better than the last one.

Get ready for the weekend pump.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:09:07
tell me what is the usd backed by.
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:24:36
LOL sounded good. The dollar has value because the government says it has value. But when other countries start printing USD like China [ China prints other counties currency. So when china starts printing counterfeit USD, the dollar will become worth less unless you get it from the United States. So the US government will look for another alternative. Same thing happened with gold. People got tired of carrying heavy coins around so the dollars was created. People got tired of carrying dollars and coins around so the debit card was created. So it just a matter of time until we adopt something else.  So this is an attempt for the government to gain as many bitcoins as they can. Hodl 
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:00:17
Correct but some people cant accumulate as much as others, so they complain that the price isn't rising fast enough. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:08:15
yea bitcoin wasnt in there. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:28:13
Well i invested 4000 at the beginning of 2017 and when btc hit 20000 I cashed out and made a 12000 profit. I have had 10000 dollars invested in a bank for a whole year and have not seen that kind of return. So I am not concerned with the 99+% of people. The banks proply tell us not to invest in bitcoin then invest our money into bitcoin. Bitcoin is the future 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:11:15
I dont gamble with bitcoin. I actually use bitcoin to pay my barber for haircuts because the banks steal your money. banks own your money Good think Im a banker at bitcoin because I own my money.

@_date: 2018-03-31 21:17:45
Buy hodl repeat. Its that easy Doesnt make sense discussing the price, it has been down since January, so expect the price to continue to go down and buy on the way to the bottom but don't invest more than you are willing to lose. Its that easy. Dont get caught up in all the hype about the price because if you are in it for the money then the lower the price the better. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:28:59
Yes they do. Ever heard of a 401k
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:34:20
Not really. That means we get to buy more at a discount.
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:30:17
 From big cities to remote villages, smartphones have become wallets, with most transactions in grocery stores now carried out digitally, leaving many printing plants short of work. Just a matter of time my fellow bitcoiners.  beleive the hype Hodl tight. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:21:40
Im confused I didn't lose money, My 1099-k said I made $4.3 mil and I am no where near that amount.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:41:08
how bout the short term.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:17:48
So why cant these same principles be applied to bitcoin. Yea but the dollar is guaranteed by anything. If a country says the usd at worth anything then what. Dont put your trust in the gov and banks. Keep your options open. All I am saying is they say bitcoin and cryptos arent backed by anything well neither is the dollar.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:29:59
Just remember Apple, Pandora, Intuit, Blogger and IBM all crasehed when they first started. Now look at theses companies, we dont know the future of crypto and btc so invest and see what happens. Im betting btc will be worth more than $50000 by the end of the year. Now that btc has exposure when it hits 8500 and stays that is when the price will skyrocket.  believeme just watch
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:00:03
More money printed less valuable it becomes. Thats why Bitcoin will be worth trillions.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:18:08
Its funny how win the price goes down people blame the "FUD" and when the prices goes up its because of "new money". So this drop must be because of BTC fork. And when the price increases its because of "fomo". I think Im catching the hang of this lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:08:38
People are afraid of power. We need the government to tell us its safe before we invest.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:27:03
Rule  buy the dips 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:55:59
Lol I didnt say hodl and become rich. I invested when it was at 2000 last year and bought low and sold high because I was a newbie but I settled down understood why i was invested and when btc hit 20000 i sold at 18000 took my initial investment and left the rest. And what will I fail at investing in something that I feel can be beneficial in the future. Lol thats like saying someone is wrong for having an opinion. why are you concernd you must be failing lol
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:58:43
Neither are computers or atm machines or printers or phones or back packs or shoes or socks or beepers or internet or cars. Who are you get with the times think outside the box for a minute. BTC can be the greatest thing but we are hodling it back. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:56:19
So what is the dollar backed by.
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:48:51
Well if you invested in the stock last week when it "crashed" that would be the real winner. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:54:11
You should educate yourself on why gold is popular. It was used because it doesn't react to chemicals like others do. So it was ideal for making coins back in the day. So basically its valuable because society says it is. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:15:33
is that correct
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:07:07
Well that's a great strategy to have. Buy bitcoin and watch your money vanish without trying to minimize your loses. You can even lend you btc to other people if your just going to sit on it lol. Like I said YOU have lots of learning to do (im my I love Lucy voice).
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:26:15
If the whales get the amount of money they are expecting then the price will drop and if not the price will rise.
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:45:02
I am not a bitcoin expert but if you look at the charts bitcoin is in a correction, not a crash. The highest price in Jan was 17.5k then dropped to 10k, in Feb the price started at 7k and increased to 11.3k, in march it started at 11.5 and were at 8.4k. So i wouldnt be suprised if it went up to 16k by the end of April. IMO
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:52:01
People ask me "hows the coin doing I don't hear you talking about it as much." And I tell them "well when the coin went from $1000 to $19,000 and I tried to tell you guys to invest and you were to afraid, so what sense does it make to try and convince you to invest when the price is going down." 
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:15:21
The dollar is backed by gold and the government and banks have the peoples best interest.

Next year??? Look at your history I was reading that btc has corrected everytime to at least 80&amp; and passes it previous ath. So if you wait til next year you will miss the moon ride.
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:27:38
I think people short because other people are selling. The people selling are trying to cut their losses so they sell lower than the next person. Think of it as an auction but in reverse. And the people who are shorting are just betting the price is going to continue to go lower than what they put their order in at. But it also work the other way, when someone buys btc and they want to sell for a profit they sell higher than the next person, and if someone thinks the price is going to continue to rise they go long.
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:28:36

Its a matter of time before bitcoin is incorporated. Just went to the movies and my wife bought the tickets online. We get to the movies and instead of standing in line we walk to the ticket taker he scans my wife's phone and we go straight to our movie theater. So imagine if they scan your phone and you are able to pay for the tickets right their. The question is when will this technology be utilized. Thats how I know bitcoin is here to stay.

My advice dont use any exchange that is not in the US. Learned this the hard way r/LakeBTC lost my bitcoins. I had 2 way enabled, password kyc. Withdraw and deposit history gone, all my btc were gone the only thing left was $31.40. It was an inside job because when I try to log on with my email and password it reads invalid. I didn't change my email and I still receive notices from r/LakeBTC to my email address. So stay away from foreign exchanges.

Those who work in finances are afraid of change, they have been doing it this way for years so when something new comes along they say it ridiculous. But if you look at all the big companies moving to technology to run their business it just a matter of time before they adopt bitcoin in those everyday activities. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:39:25
Well if someone say they are not in bitcoin because of the technology well they are definitely not in it for the money.
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:11:04
No sarcasm here most noods buy at a time like this and when the price starts to drops 200 to 600 dollars for some reason they panic and sell. So I'm pretty sure you haven't experienced a drastic correction yet. So Im saving you the heartache. So this gives you at least another year to wait to buy in.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:03:27

@_date: 2018-07-18 03:56:10

So people who own bitcoin don't like movies.
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:01:54
I would say 1 BTC. Because whatever the price s thats what You have. If btc is 1mil then you have 1mil. Most people don't understand a million dollars is not a lot of money. You spend that much on a child from birth to 18 years old. So I would say one bitcoin for every kid you have or plan on having. And If you don't plan on having children then 1 BTC will do ya.
@_date: 2018-07-16 01:34:29

So tell me why so many millionaires go broke? They have more than a million dollars and they still end up poor. A million dollars is not alot of money. Well its like asking a pilot is a million gallons of fuels is a lot of gas he'd probably say no, but if you asked that same question to a race car driver he would say yes. More money equals bigger and nicer things.

I understand but when you invest thousands in BTC and you see your stack going down that's when you will understand yourself and bitcoin. Its not about investing more than you can lose, but sometimes people rather cut off the limb instead of trying to stop the bleeding. But what ever you do when the price is down dont sell. And when the price is up dont buy. This is not financial advice.

@_date: 2018-07-08 00:09:46
So what do you think we will be when bitcoin moon. No matter how you look at it they are still millionaires. And they are people like me and you who have no idea what a million dollars is. A house alone is $250,000 (in CA)a lambo starts at $199,000 thats almost half. Dont get me wrong a million dollars is a good start but with today's economy a million dollars is easy to spend is all im saying. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 03:40:08
Yea but you really have to think if you had a million dollars the avereage american would blow it. Thats why they tell you if you win the lottery hire a financial adviser and lawyer, because we dont realize how little a million dollars is. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:37:31
So what I dont get is when bitcoin goes down people call it a bubble and compare it to the tulip craze or the beenie babies. But did the beenie babies every come back and be worth more than current years or did the tulips come back and be worth 100x more no. But bitcoin has. So when you pop a bubble how is it able to inflate again. So its would be a correction. Think about a balloon if you have way to much air you can let some out and if you have to little air you put some in you balancing and correcting the air in the balloon, but when it pops thats it game over.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:37:26
Im not defending the banks. I thinks its funny they let you borrow money under certain conditions but do whatever they want with your money.
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:00:17
Why in the world would a bank lend you money that you don't have, and if your bitcoin loses its value then they will definitely not be getting their money back. If they lend you money to buy a car they can at least repo the car and sell it to recover some loses. Imagine if you got a loan from the bank for $100,000, reinvested it all in bitcoin doubled your money and paid your loan for a $100,000 back. Lol that's what the backs do with our money.

@_date: 2018-04-13 03:48:21
I am pretty sure OMG will go lower in the future. Buy low sell high cant worry about anything you dont have no control over.
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:15:13
the "o" makes an long "I" sound. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:04:40
well let me tell you that I predicted 16k by the end of the month. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:32:33
Well if you believe that is what bitcoin is worth then dont buy until it reaches that number and if you are correct then you will be able to buy bitcoin at your ideal price and if not you will kick yourself for not buying earlier.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:19:15
Yea but how many trades did you make.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:30:37
Congrats to everyone who bought the dip from 19k and held all the way down. Bitcoin is the future yeah it might drop below 6k but just know it will come back up. You have to understand the game before you play.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:08:28
Lol well if you bought on the way down when it hits 10 u will be a happy camper.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:47:00
So what do you suggest wait until it hits zero to buy in. How will bitcoin not work??? Bitcoin is ahead of its time right now we are in the debit card stages bitcoin and crypto is the same as debit minus the banks. So if you think bitcoin will never reach its alltime high and surpass it then you must have been the naysayer that said bitcoin will never be valued over a $1000 dollars. You have to sit back and see that sometimes things are bigger than you and you mind capacity. Just because you don't understand something does'nt mean its not going to work.
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:06:50
All the above.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:12:27
Thats what I dont understand how do people buy in at ath but when the price declines they just sit and wait. Buy more u are already invested. You bout in at lets say $19000 the price is $6900 buy more because when you get back to 19000 you will be on top. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:10:32

All the above
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:28:39
I did
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:11:29
Yea but vague is what scares me lol 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:53:23
But it's not that easy, Because most people were waiting for the price to go up before they bought, now they have bought the price will go down and they will sell rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:07:53
so the previous all time highs don't mean anything 30k your weird.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:07:46
you are an idiot even a broke clock is right 2 timesca day. I understand you have an opinion but don't make it seem like u just can predict the market. In January of last year when bitcoin was under $1000 did u predict the price to be to be $20000, prolly not you probly waited for the price to crash and it kept going up and when u finally got the balls to get In the coin started to decline and when you start selling your coins the price will start going up.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:03:31
Well i buy lets say I invest $50 a paycheck no matter what the price is doing, and set a 3-5% increase. Try it im not saying everytime the price goes down buy, just set up a payment schedule to invest. Currently I have 17 orders since march 7 waiting to be filled. Its a waiting game you gotta be patient. And never sell to buy back in.
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:11:11
we need to come up with a way to confuse the bots and make them lose money. Us against them.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:59:14
You are a troll if 800 makes me a $100 or $200 thats good, your in the wrong place you need to go to brovada for those kinds of return (quadruple).
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:16:49
So does gold have to be used everyday to have value? So what about countries that use their currency on a daily bases but the currency losses it value how do you explain that. The dollar or any currency controlled by man is hypocritical. They make the low denomination bills easy to attain and the higher one harder to attain. So it a dollar is worth a hundred dollars then it should cost at least a hundred dollars to make right? Is not then that would be hypocritical.
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:40:45
If you want to see the price of bitcoin rise hodl and buy, people who dont believe in it dont deserve to have it. Let them sell and lets  make it harder for them to get back in.Set sell orders at 9000 or higher. Lets make them feel our pain.
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:41:13
U are an idiot. Thats called the shift of power. The banks took the power from the people thats why everything is so effed up. “If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks…will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered…. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.” . . . “Paper is poverty. It is the ghost of money and not money itself.”– Thomas Jefferson, 1743-1826. If you google quotes from president about banks and the all say the same thing banks are bad for the people. And how are they wrong? Banks approve home loans for a person they know will not be able to pay off a loan. So invest in bitcoin because the banks will and when the drive the price up and u didnt invest well you will be left behind I promise. Invest in cryptos it is the futures banks will be obsolete. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:45:35

@_date: 2018-04-13 00:14:11
When the price drop whales buy more coins? So what do they need with a bunch of coins that are declining? Nothing. Thats why when they have bought up enough coins they manipulate the price to increase and they sell at a higher price for profit. Its not that hard if nobody was buying crypto then thats when you know crypto is dead until then buy low sale hig, sell high buy low, hodl what ever makes you happy.
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:42:37
what I do is buy on the way down and set limits 3-5% profits its slow but you will increase your bitcoin. And at the end of the day bitcoin is what i am after.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:14:30
Yes cointracking saved me as far as gains and loses were concerned Im just worried about my 1099k and the 209000 dollars it said I grossed lol What if the government created bitcoin to generate more revenue in taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:04:43
Bitcoin is pure manipulation, if you have bots you have manipulation.

Can I get a lambo for my quilt.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:06:02
The price is dropping thats should be the time people buy yea it might not come back up but you are still buying more coins at a discount. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:29:37
Well you ca still use bitcoin as an invest ment without it reaching ATH. I you cant figure out how to make bitcoin work as an investment then you are in need of some help. Bitcoin hit 6000 buy bitcoin hits 6500 sell bitcoin hits 5000 buy bitcoin hits 6000 sell bitcoin hit 6500 buy bitcoin hit 6700 sell it doesnt have to reach ATH to make a profit.
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:53:50
IDK can you enlighten me. The less people selling the higher the price, just like the more people selling the lower the price. Its easy hodl.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:51:49
Lol if you have to ask that question dont use it.
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:16:42
Okay well the first debit card was issued in 1966 and became popular in the 1980 and 1990's which means banks have had a lot of time to figure out new ways to charge you for using your own money. So this is just the start. So call it what you want just dont miss the train ride to the moon.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:55:28
with 8k I wouldnt get a wallet because you will probably lose everything needed to access your info. With 8K  stick with gemini, or poloniex. Buy high sell low, repeat, then create a reddit account and give advice like an expert. Welcome tobitcoin.

I stick with US based exchanges.

@_date: 2018-04-14 03:49:24
Dont get me wrong I am not an expert. But bitcoin is controled by the people, we dont realize if we hold that drives up the price, but the whales who own the majority of the bitcoin know that they can control the people (not bitcoin). So they sell a bunch of bitcoin at once which drives down the price and at the same time while the price is crashing they buy more bitcoin. So when the people who are afraid of losing more money sell their coins the whales buy them all up, and when there are no more weak hands to sell the whales start to drive up the price because they bought the coins at a discount and they need to sell the coins. If you want to get rich like a whale you have to think like a whale.   
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:24:03
Well we need to make the boys crash every time.
@_date: 2018-04-11 04:04:03
dont buy as soon as you buy you will make the price drop. Lol
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:14:17
We dont know that we hope it doesnt. lol
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:35:58
I woke up in a lamb bikini. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:14:42
Ok if you take a look at amazon. Look how they are putting so many companys out of business. So the same thing will happen with bitcoin. Why do you think so many countries are trying to ban bitcoin, why are so many banks trying to ban bitcoin? The reason why is because bitcoin is a threat to them. How is bitcoin a threat? Because it takes the power from the government and banks and gives it back to the people. And if these quotes are from the 1700 and they still hold truth to them what does that tell you. I am not talking about inflation I am talking about how the banks steal your hard earned money. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:17:29
I beleive bitcoin needs test the $0k support so we can start to see an incline in the price. lol You guys are weird when the price is going down you buy and hodl when the price is going up you buy and sell its easy. So right now we are in a bear market its fine if you are losing money but you should not be losing coins, That is were alot of people mess up because they are losing money and coins lol pick one or the other in a bear market.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:15:14
Actually I think it was call ReDDcoin with to D's not redcoin. But that was the coin if Im not mistaking that coin is used to pay youtubers if you like their videos. But I think its reddcoin let me know if that was the correct coin.

Whales don't manipulate the market they manipulate the people, feel sorry for people that are buying right now shoulda bought the dips.
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:01:56
Ok well since 2009 to now why does the price keep going up because there is a demand for it. Ok well I keep investing and you figure what it is your trying to do. Either shit or get off the pot, 
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:13:25
Why is it greed just because someone is trying to make money of an investment, Is it greed when you look for a job that pays better. If you want to talk about look at your banks and government. This year the US government is expected to make $25 billion from people who invested in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:07:00
Well if you are talking about buying you are to late. This is the time to hodl and sell.

Yea I am trying to take the taxman down but I still have to be legit in doing it. So did anyone receive a 1099k. It said I made 209000 something and that was not true downloaded all my transactions from the exchanges imported to cointracking and went to the taxman. I just dont want to be caught off gaurd and faint in their office when they say I owe taxes on 209000 dollars. Lol
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:08:59
Do you, smoke, drink eat fast food, spend money on dumb crap I do. So i stop chewing tobacco and started investing, also I stop checking my facebook account and started checking my exchange account it more beneficial.

Ohh you said "pup's" I was like thats alot of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:50:25
if you are not selling for a profit you have lost. so now you are justifying why your decision is better than the guy who is holding there coins like an idiot. The money is already spent hodl.
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:13:58
They all will report to the IRS, so just learn from this tax season and pay your taxes, if you don't want to pay taxes on crypto don't invest it.
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:56:11
That's not what they are afraid of because they are banks they will always find ways to make money. What they are afraid of is losing power and control over people. Same with the government. When power and control is lost you have nothing but an opinion, kinda like us.
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:00:24
When you buy crypto currency you will lose money, but if you sre losing money and coins then you are doing something wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:09:11
So can you tell me what a debit card is backed by or what money in a bank is backed by numbers. So if I go to a store and want to purchase something how does the person know that I have the funds to cover my purchase? They dont call the bank and say hey does he have money in his account. It is all numbers. in the 1800 gold was worth $19 an ounce now its a little over a $1000 why is gold so high? Who knows. But just because you dont believe something is worth a certain prices doesnt mean its not. Crypto are the future and if you don't think so we you are in bad shape. If you think about it debit cards are backed by money, gold is backed by money cryptos are backed by money. But bitcoin is putting the power back in the peoples had. I just traded a few coins and made a little profit but the banks do the same thing with your money and they keep all the profits how is that fair. Bitcoin and cryptos are the future embrace it change is good.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:51:00
Lambro, lambro, moron, moron, ra-ta-ta
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:20:08
No I get that. What I am saying if someone is willing to buy a coin for $19000 and the coin starts going down just look at is the money is gone, lost, bad investment right. For example from the drop at $19000 I bought on the way down and Im going to sell on the way up. Buy low sell high. 18000 is lower than 19000 and 17000 is lower than 18000. So its not were the price is at its were the price is going. That's why I believe people have weak hands because when the price is going up they buy when in actuality they should be selling. So right now is the time to buy imo and Im not selling anytime soon, at least until the price is above 10k
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:43:31
Yea but if the market is being manipulated why are they going to just lower the price. They also benefit if the price increases not just decrease. So in order for the whales to profit the price has to go up. People talk about MT. Gox selling at a low price well he is probably buying them back for his personal stash. Then drive the price up to make a profit. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:10:50
Well its better to state that you are refreshing or repost an old article. Because if not you can cause panic and spread fud.

@_date: 2018-12-10 06:44:19
Maybe its a bot. Trying to gauge how people feel about btc.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:14:33
Spreading fud can actually be beneficial to btc  hodlers. Because fud drives the price down, and that's when hodlers buy more. Then the weak hands realize it was just fud so they buy back in and that drives up the price then fomo kicks in and now the hodlers are sitting on the moon.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:07:02
Not necessarly. What if he only bought one btc at $10. Lol

By the way I made $30 off $100 from shorting BTC yesterday. Not bragging but you will not get those kinds of return through the bank. Im in bitcoin for both the money and technology. If not i wouldnt be here.

Lets see you broke even so your not in the red bitcoin is going up and is expected to go up. Um I say sell.
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:40:29
The reason the price is going down is because they are trying to drive out all the weak hands. And its probably working.
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:24:44
Im not sure last year as we all remember hit ath. So I made a profit so im not sure how loses went. But im sure I will find out this year.

@_date: 2018-12-06 04:57:31
So Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and John F. Kennedy are all Presidents who were against the Banking system that have been assassinated. So they must have knew that Bitcoin was going to be the future "bitcoin enthusiast" as you call them.  [
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:26:12
So investing is greed?
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:10:34
Well i bought in last year and made a profit. Thats why im still here. So you didn't do you research. Its ok just hodl it might make you rich.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:38:52
Are you comparing BTC with cash back. First off the bank pays you 2% so you can borrow there money at 11%. So who wins lol. Maybe the more money you spend the more cash back you will get. And you say bitcoin is only ten years old, well how old is gold and how much is it work today. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:02:46
Yeah but all this finacial colapse didnt start happening until the banks got involved. So when the banks colapse bitcoin will be like gold. Only you will be easier to weight you will never have to melt it down to have smaller quantities and you can send it anywhere in the world using the internet. Have you ever tried to buy something on amazon using gold? Beleive me it sucks.
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:58:56
I sold at 18k Bought at 1700. Now I'm buying all the dips.  just money.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:31:41
So I dont understand what you want us to do. Its like watching a football game and your team starts out great then they start getting bet then they show signs of coming back. So when our the coin is doing bad it ok for us to complain, but when the coin starts showing signs of recovery we are not supposed to show emotions. I would hate to see you watch your favorite team play lol. You probably tell your wife or girlfriend dont crying when you hit them in the eye, but yell at them when she dont say "i love you'.

@_date: 2018-12-10 06:53:39
Gold is valuable because we say it is. The dollar is money because it was backed by gold. But now the dollar isnt backed by anything but the governments promise. So if china says they wont accept USD then what. How much could you buy with $100 in the 1980? You get much less today. And it opposite with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:04:47
Well good thing I hodled my bags from last time lol.

lol. Hope so
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:23:55
Cointracking.com is awesome. I used it to file my taxes last year.it tracks buys and sells gains and loses. It cost 170 a year for the unlimited version. Then you can print the information and take it to the tax man. But it save time.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:12:02
So you are the reason bitcoin is down lol. Thanks can you fomo some more so i can get bitcoin at a discount.
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:35:15
I think people are selling bitcoins to buy Chinese gifts for Christmas.
@_date: 2018-12-16 04:10:57
they also cant do it because we have are hands fool hodling these heavy bags. lol
@_date: 2018-12-03 03:22:28
I expected btc to hit ath in 2020, but it could happen a year earlier. But I know that it will go back up not today not tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:28:54
Its better to invest when the price is low instead of when the price is high. Ask people who invested at 15-20k they wish they would have got in at a lower price. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:57:17
Banks and governments collapse when the lose power of the people. So if bitcoin takes there power they will collapse.Just a matter of time.
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:30:06
I dont understand the madness. People are invested in btc but are crying because the prices are to low. They want the price to hit $6k so they can buy in.
Whales buy when the prices get lower and lower and lower and sell as the price increase. Others wait for the price to settle at a higher price range so they feel the coin has stabilized, then they buy in as the coin increase without taking profit. Then when to coin starts crashing they sell and say I will buy back in when the coin is more stable. I call it insanity.
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:23:13
How does it work. I have been tipped before but not sure how it works
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:22:09
So why are you here.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:40:52
Agree. When i got involved at the begining of 2017 I new nothing about btc. Then I bought an antminer S9 and learned quick. I promise btc is not a scam. People arent afraid of what they know (fiat), they are afraid of the things they no nothing about ( bitcoin).
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:16:01
You get it.

So if you buy in at $3000 and it hits a new all time high man hold up. You cant follow what everyone else is doing you have to be a leader. What I learned is do the opposite of the majority when there buying im selling, and when they are selling I am buying.

What's the right direction?
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:03:30
Lol then when it hits 6k what are you going to say. People know this isn't the next bull run but are happy to see value going up. So let us enjoy the moment.  GANG
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:17:30
Thats not true. I had my funds stolen from LakeBTC, I wasnt up to anything shady but just dont know who to tell. Im just going to claim it on my taxes as a loss.
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:11:58
Well thats the problem if I knew who to report it to I would. Also the exchange is located in Thailand or China.

Also with Gemini if you do a wire transfer not bank  transfer, but wire transfer you can withdraw usually the same day if you do the wire in the morning so your bank can process it the same

@_date: 2018-12-16 04:19:45
hope so.
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:20:12
That's fine so can we get excited along the journey or no?
Edit: "I know you children are very emotional with your Bitcoin instead of", you forgot your comma after Bitcoin. So what's your first language again? LOL

This meme is why I invested. Didn't know he was going down thought he was going up.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:41:43
Lol thats why they say dont time the market. Because when you finally get the courage to get in the price drops. The real questions is do you have the courage to hodl and tough it out.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:50:24
Yeah knowing who you are sending your coins to before you send them. What I am starting to understand with bitcoin and why so many people oppose of it, is because bitcoin make the individual responsible for there funds instead of an institution. You are the security against your coins being scammed. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:38:36
So will you be sending me bitcoin or cash. LOL
@_date: 2018-12-31 08:03:05
Monday dump is coming. Brace yourself.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:42:24
So is gold worth $0. And why is it so valuable. Or you dont know that either. Do you know anything. Lol
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:36:51
Does the same apply to the internet. I dont think you understand how technology works. It waits for no one. So if 80 years old better catch up.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:32:27
So what your argument on gold? Bitcoin is the future thats why it has no use now, because we dont know how to use it. So all that you type may sould inteligent ( which its not). Because at the end of the day its your opinion (not facts) so your kind of right because thats how you feel but kind of wrong because there are no facts no proof no research 
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:20:46
Yea but when someone hits the jackpot your ticket is worthless and also lottery tickets are only good for 180 (in CA). Also you are contradicting yourself, saying you were foolish for buying btc. If thats the case you should be foolish for owning something that you believe is a scam. I get it you lost money but thats because of your lack of knowledge. So if you wanna make money do your research.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:59:40
Idk that's why I asked. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:07:30
Where my bitcoiners at. Dont worry just Hodl.
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:45:13
I like that movie with Chevy chase
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:47:59
Well you still wrote it incorrect. So you should practice what you preach. Learn grammar before you try to teach it, and learn bitcoin before you give advice.
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:44:09
So do you think they stopped get out the week hands at 10k or even 7k no. They are going to get as many out so they can buy as many as many bitcoins as they can. So dont be a weak hand.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:04:40
It doesnt matter. The only thing that matters is you buy before fomo kicks in and sell before panic sets in. Ask the people who bought in at 20k if they will buy now, you may get a yes and some will say no. So like I said it dont matter. Buy base on what you beleive is going to happen.
