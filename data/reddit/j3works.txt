Usually, it's better to buy corporate bonds **at face value** *before* a company risks default (much less does so)...buy BFX at some pennies on the dollar, OK, go for it. At face value, though??

At current pricing, the BTC market cap is $9.3-billion. Not much, by financial standards. 
Note the growing big-money interest addressed here:
Wouldn't take much commitment from them to move this dial a lot, and that's before counting 'main street' entering the picture.

That central banks printing fiat like it's going out of style via 'QE' in a currency war will eventually have it's desired effect - debasing of all that currency.

I used them too. Worked great.

This is how Cryptsy (remember those lovely people?) behaved too after supposedly being 'hacked'...right up until the CEO bagged it to China with all the funds...class action suit still in progress.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:41:54
Other way around...how much will real stuff be worth in *terms* of dollars? That's the point of CB's seeking to inflate the dollar by printing $3-trillion more of them to 'stimulate.' EU, Japan, and others are doing the same with their currencies. China threatening the same. 
The point is, major countries have been engaged in systematically weakening (diluting) their own currencies relative to each other since 2008 as a means of trying to grab more exports to artificially pump up their sagging economies...all this does is build in future inflation, which will benefit hard assets (precious metals, etc.) and cryptos, I believe. Especially BTC, with its inherently deflationary supply algorithm. That's all. So, my point is not that all fiat will become *'worthless'* necessarily, but it will be *worth less* in a meaningful way. My bet, inside 3 years, looking at economic developments.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:42:41
I'm new to the details of this debate, so forgive my ignorance here. Your point seems easy to see. Why the fight? Just let txn costs go up some and keep Bitcoin as the most secure chain for larger transactions where the fee is cost efficient. Let small transactions in volume go to other platforms. Why so hard?
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:40:40
Free fall?? Really?
Keep your eye on stocks, bonds, most commodities, and fiat in the days ahead, if you want to see 'free fall!!'
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:55:42
If we think about it more in terms of 'when will fiat finally crash (fiat down = BTC up) under the weight of supremely stupid monetary policies,' the event is surely getting closer.

Even creditors (much less depositors) only get hurt by 'insolvency' *after* the failed company has lost all its equity and turned over control. Only *then* do the company's assets get sorted out in court, and those with claims against the assets take haircuts. 
Here, Bitfinex seems to be circumventing (or self-deciding) their own loss and just passing out the balance of the loss to depositors *of their own authority*, and without regard to their own impact. That's a 'bail-in' of EU proportion, straight from Brussels!

"Bitcoins are worth money, but they are *not money* as it is traditionally understood."
Curiously however, the author never cares to define 'money' in support of his assertion.
How about this, Money: A medium of exchange, unit of account, and storer of value (vs. leaker of value, like fiat) that is fungible, divisible, durable, and limited in supply. 
BTC? Hmmm, looks pretty good to me. He can keep his 'traditional fiat currency' and his 'protectorate' banks.

Might be worth pointing out that illegal markets use a lot of US cash Dollars too, so are they opposed to the public having access to cash as well (quite relevant today)? In fact, if the mere 'possibility' of doing something illegal with something is sufficient grounds to ban it, perhaps we should ban curtains in household windows...that way the government can 'verify' people aren't doing something illegal in their living rooms. After all, do people who close their curtains at night 'have something to hide?' It's the same [wrongful] principle.

Cryptsy withdrawals in the major currencies (at least) have been frozen for many days now. Many trouble tickets have been submitted by users (three by myself) and the canned reply is below. Deposits are still taken in just fine, but no warning about the freeze. Bad sign. Avoid!
 "Currently we are experiencing problems with our withdrawal system.
If you place a withdrawal for BTC LTC DASH BTCD and a few other coins, you may experience delays. 
We appreciate your patience while we resolve these issues.
If you would like to cancel a withdrawal, please create a "new" ticket and choose "Cancel Withdrawal" 
from the ticket type."

Depending on the amount you are thinking to hold, you could look at setting up an IRA LLC (self-directed IRA), sometimes called 'checkbook IRA's.' They give you a pretty full level of control of investment vehicles like this.
Mechanically, this option works - having said that however, there are details you will want to weigh up first. Realistically, you'll need a CPA involved to ensure you keep inside IRS rules for such things, but done properly, I think they can provide a good option.
One such company is Pensco Trust Company. They have info about their program here:

What is the referendum about primarily, in your view?
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:58:32
Very interesting. I appreciate this perspective on the issue. As an outsider, it seems the financial markets view this through the lens (however miopic) of: 1. Will this help or intensify the banking problem, and 2. will this lead to PM Renzi resignation and likely a new anti-euro government. 
With your insight, it may be that these two points are just byproducts, and the referendum will be decided more by whether citizens favor more or less power consolidation in government.
May I ask your opinion of the outcome and why, as one with internal perspective? Thanks.

I've been waiting for 8 days now for a withdrawal to be completed. And we're an existing, fully onboarded corporate account. Maybe I should contact Synapse directly too! I'm losing confidence in their system. Any suggestions? How did you contact Synapse Pay? I thought their system was supposed to be 'automated' once put into place - apparently not.
@_date: 2017-04-20 11:23:23
Fair counsel, but most issues being raised here (myself included) are much longer - 8 days and counting for me on a standard transaction withdrawal as a fully-onboarded account already. If this continues through tomorrow, that will cost me 2 weekends! This isn't FUD. It's a serious operational problem. I will be quite happy to post when it eventually clears.
EDIT: Our funds just arrived. Reportedly wires didn't go out for some time due to outages at Digital Ocean. Can't confirm that part, but after 8 days, our wire transfer posted. Woohoo.

I'm having a similar problem. Definitely do not leave funds there!
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:45:56
First, you really should summarize your point directly, not expect people to read random pet articles. I did read it, however, and don't agree with its premises or conclusions.
Essentially it argues, problems stemming from lending are somehow Bitcoin's fault, even though that would be the case for any honest money (vs. this 'elastic' crap that cheats the honest earner). Don't lend beyond 100% reserves, problem avoided. Go beyond a 3-person economy, problem reduces.
Key issue is to understand an honest vs debased money system. Bitcoin is honest money. I'm happy to store in that and exchange in that. So-called lenders and borrowers, pay your satoshi and take your chances, lest we recreate a new system of banking bailouts in the name of 'too big to fail'. In this scheme, somebody will lose their shirt...it ought not be the saver/earner. Thank you Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:45:23
Inflation is theft and corruption. It steals from savers who earned their money and advances whatever a corrupt government wants, usually themselves. Move to Venezuela if you think inflation is good. Blah, blah blah.
@_date: 2018-07-03 11:16:33
“Ofc people lose faith in it then”
Why is it so understandable that people ‘then’ lose faith due to inflation if inflation is so good? Is a little bit of cancer good, just not too much?

@_date: 2016-10-23 06:44:40
Alt coins don't yet have the attention nor trust of broader masses to serve as an 'escape route' as I described...this thread is addressing Bitcoin with its very significant network effects and history.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:13:50
Easy...currency adoption is not a binary issue (i.e. 0% or 100% usage, on/off, pass/fail). It surely wasn't for gold, paper, plastic, and not now either for network money...yet it grows, and grows, and grows.
Every key disruption proceeds by an S-Curve of adoption, but hey, feel free to wait for the '100%-ish' usage; late adopters are fine - just don't expect to then get it anywhere near the current price.
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:18:27

@_date: 2016-10-22 18:10:23

@_date: 2018-04-21 23:01:17
It's a simple (i.e. seeks no other objective) platform of trust for transfer of value and has the most proven security. Period. Complexity equals risk. Lots of great ideas working out in crypto, but if you want to store and transfer value in the most proven and secure way...Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:23:26
Engineered honesty vs. engineered dishonesty. Pretty clear contrast.
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:09:35
Not to mention, you actually possess and control the Bitcoin...maybe you get access to that bank account 'value' when you want it, with enough time, permission, and expense.
@_date: 2016-10-22 17:06:55
Most likely, it's the result of the Yuan getting ever cheaper relative to the USD...check out a chart on your favorite service. Now that the Yuan is officially in the SDR basket of international currencies (as of early October - they had to 'behave' until then), the Chinese are probably going to let their currency weaken even further to try and shore up their economy by boosting exports...Very likely we will see even more capital trying to escape China soon, and BTC is known to be a good method to escape the inevitable gov't capital controls!
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:02:58
Good counsel. Violate it at your own peril.
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:28:35
Don't miss the forest through the trees...Bitcoin is the best and most proven decentralized platform of trust in cryptocurrency. It is demonstrating increasing value and adoption. The usability layers and network effects that develop which add to its core capabilities are amplifiers, while those that seek to offset Bitcoin's advantages (say some sort of censorship layer) will fade into irrelevance. I see no reason to doubt Bitcoin's objective and success even if it does not 'defeat' fiat per se (i.e. become ubiquitous to a predetermined degree).
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:55:23
Oh, no...NY ban Bitcoin!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:52:18
Bitcoin isn't a magic wand to cure all social ills. It's just an honest financial ledger (money) system. As you say, "I don't trust people. I trust numbers." Well, this part is solved.

Currencies generally have cross-market values, so there is not one answer, but many. For example, what is gold 'worth' - well, that has one answer in terms of dollars, another in terms of Euros, another in terms of yen, etc.
So also with btc. Various exchanges quote a btc-usd market, a btc-euro market, btc-yuan, etc. You can even find btc-gold and btc-silver markets. One day, might have btc-commodity markets.
In the end, btc is a currency (working towards true money, actually) and will get used to price all these other things as a unit of account, including whatever would follow the dollar if it fell out of use.

@_date: 2016-10-23 01:19:15
Not necessarily. People have a reason to be quick about getting out of trouble (ie. before brewing capital controls bite), but they don't have to be quick then about moving from BTC into other things in short order (ie, a dump). Most BTC holders are quite comfortable letting their value store up there.
To your other point, I don't believe such a dump has played out yet, probably for the reasons I mentioned...no focal point incentive to race out.
@_date: 2016-10-14 02:03:38
Your goal is understandable - getting the funds away from fiat risk.
My approach is to do so too, but in a sensibly diversified way. 
First, I committed to a 50/50 split between precious metals and crypto currencies. Both have their place and their advantages.
Then I split those categories between gold/silver (pick a percentage you like) and BTC/altcoin (pick what you like). I hold the largest crypto % in Btc (most secure and stable), and gave a minority to a couple others I follow.
Just one approach, but don't hang everything on one product, no matter how much you like it.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:46:04
Oh, brother...I've never really understood this whole 'analytical' approach to valuing a proven platform of trust in a world of justifiable distrust. How, exactly, does someone model the value of trust, anyway??
