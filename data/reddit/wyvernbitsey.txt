I'm not doubting it's existence - I'm wondering why.  Going rate for real-estate loans in the US is like 3.5%.  Margin rates from US brokerages are more than that, but not double digits.
Why the huge delta in rate?  It has to be related to risk.  I'm just not clear where that risk is coming from.

but the supply could be easily increased and the delta of margin motivates it.  You can get a HELOC @ sub 5%.  A delta of 20-95% annually is crazy.
It has to be more than just supply/demand - there's got to be risk of everyone would be doing it and the delta would come down.

not in dollars - but you can deposit BTC and there are plenty of fiat-&gt;BTC exchange mechanisms.

how so?  Why are the different?

default - by the party you lent to?  how so?  The exchange prevents them from just withdrawing and running w/ the funds.  The margin limits are pretty tight and the exchange auto-cashes you out if you fall below.
Or - did you mean default by the exchange?  If they get shut down by a govt or similar and you can't withdraw...or they get hacked?

that is exactly the kind of depth I was looking for, thx.  Based on this, it does look like 'easy' tracability is backward looking, though...if you know where it went it's easy to find where it came from.  The reverse is clearly possible because the chain is finite, but runtime O(length of the whole chain), yes?
