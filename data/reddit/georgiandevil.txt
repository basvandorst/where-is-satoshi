If the business model is to profit from fees it only makes sense to create the biggest pool to take fees from. The more people in, the more money that can be taken from them as they conduct transactions. It's when exchanges fudge their business model and begin to favor one of the offerings in their portfolio over others that bad things start happening to companies and people. Money always makes people stupid. Big money, even more so. Sloppiness fueled by hubris and greed is never rewarded.

Theoretically they'll be stuck in limbo until the market drops making those bids desirable again. The system doesn't presently scale well unfortunately. A time out function for fees would be a good stop gap.

I'm not sure. Perhaps a time out is built in as in these posts from 2013 seem to indicate. 
It may also be because of some other factor that doesn't meet the minimum requirements for transactions. I'm honestly not sure. Sorry.

The solution to transaction fees is in the way they are created. The problem right now is that those seeking to make a transaction must bid high enough to get the attention of the miners if they want their transactions completed in a timely manner. What has to happen for these coins to become viable, spendable currency is that the bidding needs to be done by the miners. If those seeking to make a transaction automatically are given the lowest bid price and the miners are then required to bid low in order to pick up fees it will ultimately drive the price of fees down. The side effect could be a lower priced coin however. But still a more stable spendable coin.
Right now though the system is broken. Prices are being inflated because of the structure of the fee system. In any event, I just hodl.

This is not the guy you want to be the face of your fledgling coin. Exchanges shouldn't take sides.

The big Bitcoin Cash holders are trying to get out in front of this right now and unload their holdings before this update is released. That's why they are pumping their coin.
