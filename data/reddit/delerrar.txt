Sorry do you have anything to back up your claims about TOR? From everything I've read about i2P says that there hasn't been enough open source researcher into its safety to make any claims about it being better than TOR. 
So I'd be really interested in reading anything you have about it being better than TOR.

I'm not sure if he's got anything to back it up honestly. I'm a bit perplexed by his answers.
Still really curious to read what he's read. I'm sure it'd be interesting.

Thank you for the links. I've read all of those already, unless I'm mistaken though those specific attack vectors have been known for a long time and have been sorted out. But I could be wrong. I'd love to read your literature on i2P that makes you so sure of it's superiority. As I can not be sure of what you have read I can't exactly google it now can I? That's why you ask for sources, so that you can read exactly what the other person has read.
I also like the implication that I'm going to jail and am an idiot for asking a simple question. I've already outlined what I've read by googling i2P, and that is that it hasn't had as much extensive testing as TOR meaning we don't know where it's vulnerabilities lie. We do with TOR. So help me out and let me read what you have, I'm genuinely curious. I'm also going to add that I don't do anything illegal so I'm really curious to know why I'm going to get raped in prison.


That's not how this works. I didn't make any claims, you did. Then I said "huh, that not what I read. Could you link me to your source?" Then usually the person I'm having a convo with links to their source and we all live happily ever after. You on the other hand didn't do that and instead provided me with a link to information warfare and then proceeded to call me an idiot. Usually that means someone's talking out their ass. Are you talking out your ass? If not please link your sources, I'd enjoy reading them.

I've been asking for his sources on i2P being safer that TOR as I have not read anything that makes that claim. He's been unwilling to provide them to me which makes me think he's talking out his ass.

Ya and it sound like if they'd have been on i2P (in its current form) we'd have way more busts. and it's not just 2 cherry picked responses. One is something that happened and the other **is from  the i2p designers themselves** where they list 17 possible methods of attack on their network. The first and simplest one listed is a brute force attack where they have this to say.


There are at least two exchange points in the US that I'm aware of, both operated by the NSA. 
Or how about a harvesting attack? Something the devs once again tell us they aren't adequately prepared against. 


They even say their only way to stop this is with more users and some router side limits.
Even i2P is vulnerable to Sybil attacks which is what caused the issues with TOR. 
Again I'm all for i2P but this it's safer than TOR right now stance of yours has no basis in reality and hasn't been actively proven. When a Hidden Service get's really big on i2p and draws the attention of the feds I guess we'll see how safe it is.

Fine. Here's a question for you, what is your [response to i2P de-anonymizing TAILS users?]( Or how about what the developers said about their own network?


I'm down with i2P but it's just not at the level that TOR is yet and sounds like it is still small enough to find users easily.

What? You're the one making statements about TOR being unsafe, I just wanted you to link to what you've read because I would be interested in reading it. But then you linked to an article on information warfare. 
I also have absolutely no idea what we are repeating and rehashing. I feel like there's been some crossed wires somewhere where you think I've said something I didn't say.
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:37:18
Ok.... I'm still going to need a source on your claims that TOR is unsafe an i2P is better. The article you've linked me to has nothing to do with i2P or TOR so it doesn't do me much good.
I'm open to TOR not being the safest anymore but I'm going to need some proof.

Didn't your market go live in January? Evo has been up for a year. Your idea has been around longer sure, but your market hasn't.

Ya it's too much effort when there are better alternatives. Thanks for helping me out.

I'm out east, more specifically the Montreal area. I may have to go the localbitcoins route. 
Hadn't looked at quickbt they don't seem that bad. My issue isn't so much privacy as not wanting to provide proof of residence and my drivers license out just to be able to get a hold of BTC. 
Thanks for the heads up about quickbt.
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:16:08
Thanks for the help! Just did a test with quickbt and it worked perfectly.
