no.. or rather, it doesn't have to be. if you pick your input transactions you can only pick the ones you want, ignoring the 'dust' ones. the bitcoin-qt interface doesn't let you choose input transactions though.. so you'd have to use some other client.

well they (bank of canada) can still create as many dollars to back them as they want - it's just that other (non-central) bank's won't be able too play too.

well when they were using dwolla they would only be doing a few wires between their us account and japan.. with the vast majority of customer payments being processed through dwolla.. when dwolla stopped working they would have had a  huge increase in wire transfer requests.. i wouldn't be surprise if this soured their banking arrangements.. if a few thousand extra wires suddenly hit the bank and many of them might require some manual processing - it might well annoy somebody.

can you explain a bit about how it works? does someone at joinsnapcard order the stuff for you using their own credit card? if it's automatic, presumably it doesn't work on all sites? but the video makes it seem like it does..

It's just a comment on the blockchain.info site.. it's not really any more relevant than anything we say here.
