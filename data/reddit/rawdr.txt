It's only "trustless" after you personally research the concepts and understand them yourself. (Even then you are still trusting that the hundreds of separate groups of people that program and audit the code aren't actually conspiring against you, until you've done so yourself.)
This concept is exactly what they are asking about. So I don't know why you think it is strange that one should ask why or how you trust Bitcoin. It's literally the most important aspect of it.

When you say private key, are you talking about a 12 word seed?
Edit: if you are, then click the extra options on that page and choose the checkbox for "BIP39". Then it will ask you for a 'derivation path'. Try: m/0'/0
Read through this for more info if it applies to you: 
No matter what, trust that if you have the private keys to where the coins WERE and also where you attempted to send them, you ought to get your coins back... It just may take time.

I downloaded it recently, in the US. Also, Bitfinex.
Edit: forgot Bitfinex does not support US customers anymore

Both your BTC and BCH exist on the private keys that held BTC at time of fork. If you send your BTC to an exchange, your BCH will still be on those original keys. You'll have to then use a BCH compatible wallet to separately send your BCH elsewhere.

I use Google Assistant. Activate assistant and there's an option, "What's on my screen?" And it identifies the QR code.
But obviously this won't work for all phones unfortunately.

I think your question IS your example  If you had a computer that could brute force any hash instantly, you'd have it find the private key to any given public one and that would be Bitcoin-breaking.
Edit: Also I'm not sure it's true that any btc address can be encoded using the 12-word protocol. It's probably a method to derive a btc compatible address, but all possible combinations are probably just a subset of all possible btc addresses.
