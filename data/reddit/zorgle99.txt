If people flipped coins to decide whether to make a trade or not; someone out of the many millions of people who attempt flipping will by chance make a shit ton of money doing it: that does not indicate that person has a skill nor that his method works. This is how gambling and lotteries work, pure chance, someone wins, but very few: those people are simply lucky, don't look to them as examples.  
This is also known as survivorship bias; you can't just look at the winners, you have to look at the losers doing the exact same thing and it not working. Looking at "winners" is an inherently flawed method of reasoning.

Elliot waves are still TA, sorry.


And you utterly missed his point about the Pareto distribution, pointing out an anecdote is in no way meaningful at all as a response to that; his argument is over your head.

Wrong, with enough people guessing, someone is bound to guess right purely by luck.  You clearly don't understand statistics and probability.  This is not different than millions of people playing the lottery and one or two of them guessing correctly.  When enough people play a game of chance, even over many years, someone by pure chance is going to guess right enough times to get rich: that's not a skill, it's just how probability and chance works.


Wrong.  You've shown you don't know how to think logically, you ignore the millions who guess wrong and your lack of mathematical thinking has you thinking the guy who guessed right has a special skill; you have no understanding of how chance works. Poor thinking like this is why trading exists, you lack the ability to logic it out so you fall victim to superstitious thinking; you'll be one of the millions who'll lose emulating the strategy of someone who simply got lucky because you don't know how to think.
