Too many characters in your username mate, we standardised on 16.

How does running a non-mining full node client do that exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:37:06
I was disappointed they didn't go all the way to the top.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:38:59
Great arguments there. Really backed it up with solid technical analysis. No hint of bias whatsoever.

Everyone's coins are a bounty for quantum computing right now.

You're bamboozled. You need to research more. How do you know when the final dip is? It could easily go below $1000 over the next few days. By then hash power could have switched to the more profitable chain.

Ha, Reddit admins siding with mods about vote brigading and censorship. So rich. Ever heard of a false flag operation? Probably you won't even see this comment because it will be deleted.

Could have bought a lifetime contract with 60 TH/s on pool.bitcoin.com for $25K which would earn $84 a day (297 days to recoup investment). Or a bunch of antminers. What a waste.

I'd just convert my country to electric cars/trucks/trains/planes as fast as possible.
Pre-mined coins have no credibility whatsoever and the market price would reflect that.

You won't get banned for sarcasm.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:06:31
But at a cost of a reduction of security for Segwit.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:51:38
It doesn't do jack. Unless you have 20 exahashes of mining power connected to it as well.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:30:59
I bet 250,000 BTC that 2X wins and streamrolls 1x.
See, anyone can make ridiculous bets if you don't have the funds to prove the bet is legitimate.
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:57:37
If you no longer have the majority of the hash rate and you decide to do an emergency POW change to keep your chain alive then you no longer can claim the name Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:14:12
Why does a blocksize increase suddenly make all these companies now have to be AML/KYC compliant with whitelists and blacklists? Preposterous.

"No work being done" is because the code is in a code freeze until the November fork. If you know anything about software development you can understand why code freeze is a good idea right before the upgrade of a 100 billion dollar network.

Miners are the ones who have invested millions or even billions in specialised ASIC equipment in keeping the network running. Nobody else has invested that much. Now you want to kick them out? Who are you? You're nobody. You literally have no skin in the game in comparison. It's the height of arrogance. The only coin you create by changing the PoW will be considered an altcoin. You'll have to compete with the original Bitcoin for market share and find people to mine your altcoin for you to keep the network running. Why don't you just switch to Bgold?
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:21:04
Think it's complicated now, just wait until you add Lightning Network to that flow chart.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:45:39
If there's no replay protection and 90%+ of the hash power follows the 2X chain then the 10% chain effectively stagnates and dies, thus the 2X chain is an upgrade and continues on without major drama keeping the BTC brand, and ticker.

I would also check to see if the whitepaper uses a comma before an and. That email looked to be out of place and poor writing style whereas the whitepaper was well written.
From the email:


From the whitepaper:


redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes."
The email writer would have probably used 3 commas there before the ands. The email is from a different person. Slam dunk fake.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:49:50
OK sure, just wait another 18 months for that right? I could also just use Bitcoin Cash or any altcoin to do the same thing without the vaporware.

To get a morning coffee you need to set your alarm for 6am. Then send Bitcoin to your local cafe. Then go back to sleep. When you wake up at 8am, check if it's confirmed. If not you need to increase the fee with the Replace By Fee feature. When you get to your local cafe at 8:55am you can pick up your freshly made latte before starting work at 9am.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:05:51
If you can even call r/bitcoin a community anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:10:31
It can also be 10thed.
