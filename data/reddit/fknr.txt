Not much good to pseudo-advertise a local business on a worldwide website.
But if anyone needs their will, powers-of-attorney, or trust done and you're in Ohio, give me a personal message and I'll hit you up.
I just get a paycheck so you won't be doing me any favors, but I can definitely discount some services for you.

Lol no. If you're in columbus, happy to have you tag along on some hearings if you want some court room experience. For some basic ones I can even let you handle them as a law student if the court approves it and as long as I am standing over your shoulder.

None of that is even close to true. The value of bitcoin has gone up because there are vastly more buyers than sellers.
Everything else is pulled out of your ass.

Yes. But no need to realize short term gains.
If I receive and liquidate, I'm paying (according to current tax code) short term cap gains taxes.
If I hold longer than a year, I pay a much lower rate.
Instead of fucking around with it, I'll just let crypto be my payment. If possible, I'll pay in crypto and let the seller figure out the taxes.
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:06:35


I appreciate the support... but on this small point alone, lawyers generally don't do good business if they are suing their own clients.
I'd more likely lay the file down and tell the client that until they pay me, no further work will be done.
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:03:30
Somehow.... I escaped with the payment confirmed.... whew I got lucky!
I'll take your advice seriously. But I accept checks from clients all the time. I have no idea if they'll bounce 10 days later.
But if they bounce (or if the transaction isn't confirmed), then I don't do further work for them until they pay me.
It's not like I'm working up their wills, powers of attorneys and trusts while they're in the office with me. This is a multi-week relationship.

I dunno, I'm a lawyer not an accountant. As a lawyer, I understand what accountants are telling me (most of the time), but I don't have the full picture that they do.
So basically I try not to liquidate crypto until I have enough to buy an airplane.
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:49:30
if you're gonna take it, you've gotta take it when you take it. If you want to cash out immediately, take the transaction cost and cash out.
For me. I've always told myself, bitcoin payments will always be bitcoin until such time that I buy myself an airplane. Then I'll figure out the taxes and such.
Altcoins I'll take, but I'll convert to bitcoin except for Eth which I think has proven itself to be non-speculative to the extent that crypto can be considered non-speculative.
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:58:15
I agree to an extent.... My personal belief is two fold: 
1. Bitcoin is king. There will always be a king of Crypto. I am not sure if Bitcoin will always be king. But today Bitcoin is king.
2. Crypto is here to stay. There is too much value in the ability to (1) hold value -- see Venezuela; (2) transfer money beyond borders without being searched; and (3) of course the black market.
Secondly, I believe that there will ultimately be ONE primary crypto (Bitcoin looks to be the one now, but that could change but first to market and the momentum it has is a huge barrier to cross -- BUT there's a LOT of future ahead of us), but I also believe that there will be 1-20 altcoins that do something better than Bitcoin does that keep major market share.
You aren't going to find that Bitcoin or any crypto can do EVERYTHING people want. So you will end up with a primary transaction coin (Bitcoin now) and some other coins that offer additional features. You can honestly think of them as second layers.
I don't think there will be a coin out there that has 17-layers that can do everything from POS processing, contracts, all the way down to settlement layer processing. I might be wrong, but I bet it will be 2-20 coins that "solve" the various issues in harmony rather than 1 coin doing it all.
So if you believe Crypto has a future (and I think those barn doors are open) then you are left with which coins are going to do it?
As I said, Bitcoin is king. It will probably be king until a major financial institution uses some other coin (not usurps, but uses). Eth is clearly a contender as a "smart-contract" deal. But there are some others out there with promise. But all those that pretend to simply be "better than bitcoin" are losers. You have to offer a different product and most coins are simply offering cheaper or faster transactions. All within the wheelhouse of Bitcoin.

Those stupid banks that replace your money if someone steals it (and it’s their fault). Those stupid banks that pay you money to hold your money there. Those stupid banks that make it super easy to pay or transfer cash to anyone else who deals in regular currency. 
The opponent is not banks. Banks will be a part of bitcoin someday. 
The opponent is shitty governments. Venezuela for example.

Technically you are right. But the irs couldn’t care less about most 709 gifts. Unless you are at risk of hitting your lifetime exemption (in the millions) your gift is tax free for the giver and the acceptor. 
The irs wants bill gates to file 709s. They don’t care if joe bitcoin does it for a mortgage. I mean I suppose they care but there’s no tax to collect so why would they waste resources punishing people?

The easy answer is that wall street will eventually get their lawyers to establish a proper ETF for crypto currencies. Crypto will become part of many people's diversified portfolios. 1% here, 2% there.
Currently bitcoin's market cap is ~ $120 billion.
Add in institutional money.... 401k's, mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.... and you easily add a quick $500 billion in new dollars in bitcoin.
That will at minimum force the price up 5x and likely much higher.
If you believe that the SEC will eventually approve wall street to include crypto into managed funds, then every dollar you put in prior to that date is going to be worth so much more after.
If you don't believe that the SEC will eventually approve it, then you are right to be skeptical of $100,000 bitcoin.
I believe that SEC approval will indeed happen in the next 2-5 years.
Because of that, I also firmly believe (if SEC approval happens) that I will see $1m bitcoin in my lifetime.

I don't. Long term it doesn't matter. Either BTC will be a viable commodity or it won't.
If it is, it will be worth $1m / coin in my lifetime. So I don't care what it is today.
If it doesn't become viable, then it will eventually go to zero or near-zero. In which case the money is gone.
Which one do you believe in?

Bitcoin is much closer to replacing gold than it is to replacing fiat.
Bitcoin will be a reserve currency, and it will be an *accessible* currency for people in troubled nations (politically or economically).
Bitcoin may well save millions if not billions of people's lives.
But being capped at a particular number means that it cannot replace fiat currency ever.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:06:57
I agree with you about BTC being a hedge against fiat...
But I don't think there's going to be any weakness in the US market for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:47:26
You answered your own question about gold. It is not low-friction.
It takes a lot of effort to move gold. In difficult areas of the world, it is near impossible to bring it across the border.
Bitcoin can be moved across a border by simply remembering 6-24 words in order.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:46:32
Okay, I like that there is a TTL on transactions.

It's not a dumb question but your question's answer does require some underlying knowledge about how economies work.
First, as a baseline, all economics are a voluntary exchange of value whereby both parties *increase* their current holdings.
I would rather have a particular gallon of milk today than $3.00 in my wallet.  
The grocery store would rather have $3.00 than that particular gallon of milk.
We have both gotten more value out of the exchange.
The Fed prints currency at various rates in order to stabilize the amount of currency in the market and keep prices from being a daily shit show.
Imagine if a grocery store was BTC based? They would have to re-price every item every single hour because BTC can move up or down $400 in a matter of minutes.
But that doesn't really answer your question yet. It only explains why the Fed needs to adjust its printing schedule from time to time to dial in the amount of inflation.
Your question was "Why does a currency need to be inflationary?"
The second part of the answer requires another fundamental understanding of economics. 
The baseline of all economics is creation of value.
All underlying value is created by work. You put in your time and effort (to grow crops, to clean a pool, to navigate through a courtroom) and someone pays you for that time and effort.
As populations grow, more people are doing work and more people need services. 
Imagine a small village of 10-20 people. Maybe 10,000 $1 bills could be sufficient to make all exchanges among people for all time. 
Now they meet another village of 10-20 people, and another village of 10-20 people. [Population Growth]
Suddenly, those $1 bills are getting spread pretty thin. If you've only got $4 in your pocket and you can't split a dollar bill, you're not giving up 25% of your wealth today for a good or service that only cost you a hundredth of your wealth a few years ago.
So what are the solutions?
Solution  [Most Countries]: Print more $1 bills so that a dollar continues to buy about the same as it did last year.
Solution  [BTC]: Divide the BTC further and further so that you can spend smaller portions.

Nothing can go up 900% / year forever. We all know this. It's insane. In fact the mere fact that it HAS gone up 900% this year should clue EVERYONE in that we are in a bubble right now.
It's going up (so much) this year because of new money. Some of that new money has no attachment to btc at all and will take profits when they think it is smart to do so.
When that new money takes profits and the price drops $1000 or $2000, a lot of old and medium aged money will sell to save their profits too. Could be a 30-50% drop. Or less. Or more.
However... when that drop happens is hard to say. Will it happen tomorrow? Or will it happen in 6 months when BTC is at 15,000 and it drops down to 5k again?
No one knows the answers to these things. 
Predicting is hard, especially about the future.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:06:24
Correct, but bitcoin can bubble just as much as anything can.
We may be in a bubble now and it may crash down to $100/btc tomorrow.
We may be just raising new floors. 
Personally, I believe that once institutional money comes in, we will see BTC go to a minimum of $50,000 in short order.
But I also believe that if institutional money comes in, it will affect all major cryptos. The ones that are chosen to be part of ETFs will skyrocket. The remainder will be left in the dust as fads.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:41:49
No one is going to use bitcoin as a transactional currency during the year that it rises over 900%.
That's insane.
Why would you buy a coffee in march with BTC when in December the same BTC can buy a laptop?
BTC will never be used mainstream transactionally until the price stabilizes. 
The price won't stabilize until all (or most) potential players are in the market.
The more adoptation it gets the more players in the market and the higher it rises.
We WILL see a big drop when some players take profits and others sell on fear of the drop.
But as long as the fundamentals are there (real world transactional acceptance) then BitCoin will eventually be worth $1million / coin.
Bank on it.

I 100% believe you're right that it is a good indication for long term growth.
I also believe it has no bearing on whether we will go through a correction, or even a crash in the coming weeks or months (or maybe we'll get lucky and things will just stabilize for a while).
I don't believe that the futures market will directly affect the BTC price but it should be bullish in the sense that it brings more attention to BTC and therefore more investors may start putting money in Crypto, therefore indirectly putting positive pressure on the price.
The real "boom" (if we can even call anything after a 1,500% price increase over a year an additional boom) will be when ETFs are activated and people can sink part of their portfolio into BTC without having to have technical knowledge or set up their own wallets.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:23:09
Right? If there's "free" energy, any miner is profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:39:07


That doesn't change the equation.
As long as the population (by coin volume) of bitcoin buyers is greater than the population of bitcoin sellers, then the price will rise.
That's fine. But it also means that there's little use for it as a transactional currency. Like I said, why spend X BTC today for a coffee when in 1 year the same BTC can buy a laptop or a tesla :-)
Furthermore, the price cannot stabilize with a finite sum of bitcoins and an increase in economic activity.
Fact of economics. This should not be controversial with anyone knowledgeable in basic economics. 
So the only conclusion for the time being (it could change, but for now) BTC is a replacement for gold, or other limited commodities. It will not be transactional unless fundamentals change.
I'm not advocating for those changes. I honestly like BTC as a holder of wealth rather than transactional. But if BTC wants to be transactional, it will never do so once it hits the cap of 21m coins.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:08:19
If an ETF is approved by the SEC then we're looking at an easy 500b increase in market cap.
If the SEC does it, then every other major world market governing body will do it. Another 1t market cap.
BTC = 1m / coin in my lifetime (37 yr old)
IF (and only IF) the SEC approves it to be traded.

Many (and I propose most) Trump supporters do not consider themselves "hypernationalistic", merely patriotic.
I'm giving my own opinion here, but I think it applies to many if not most Trump supporters but: I believe that Obama felt as "leader of the free world", as they say, he needed to act as a neutral arbitrator of the "free world" which sometimes led to decisions that impacted America poorly.
I also believe that Trump does not worry about being "leader of the free world" but instead worries about being leader of "America". And thereby acts in the best interests of America.
From my point of view (and you are free to disagree that my point of view is wrong), but from my point of view, that isn't hyper nationalistic, that is simply serving those who elected you.
It's no different than if you are the head of a major company that is dominant in a particular field. (Google perhaps?).
Running with this off-the-cuff-analogy, would your shareholders want you to act in the best interest of all the competing advertising companies or would your shareholders want you to act in the best interest of Google and let other advertisers act in their own best interests too?
The answer is obvious, but would you call that hyper-self-corporate-interest? Or simply proper?
At any rate, this isn't a forum for politics and I'd appreciate if the mods delete MY comment and all the other political comments in this general thread.
