Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?

We do use AC now but DC is much safer.

That’s cute, she wants to primary the speaker of the house and one of the most popular politicians in the country.

lol this isn’t civil disobedience, it’s money laundering.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:19:14
Same with your assumptions and biases. I’d rather trust the word of an official report backed up by two years of high-level investigation over the rants of some dude online.
Your narrative was made up by Assange to cover for the Russians.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:49:05
Well it backfired. Wikileaks only served to elect the most corrupt and untrustworthy administration in history.

Venezuela used to be the richest economy in LA before Chavismo ruined their country. 
Inflation like that isn’t common outside of grossly mismanaged economies but it still happens often. Even if it’s not drastic like Venezuela inflation is universal.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:10:41
Seriously? You are saying that Venezuelans had no savings to lose? 
I’m not sure why you are being such a contrarian asshole but you most likely have some ulterior motive that I don’t want to fuck with. 
Enjoy your weekend friend.
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:04:19
You didn’t say anything that is true, champ. 
I’m just puzzled as to what your motivations are for belittling the need for all folks to hold inflation proof currency?  Maybe you are an ignorant gringo that thinks Venezuelans always ate grass, or maybe you are a chavista that is mad about hearing the truth of what your regime did to the country of Venezuela, or maybe it’s some crypto drama bullshit that I have no understanding of. Please enlighten me.

I think there is a difference between transparency and weaponized selective leaks. 
It turns out that not only was Assange self-serving but also serving the enemies of the US. 
Do I want republican emails leaked? Not if the intent is to hurt our country.
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:19:31
Republican senate is covering for them. But we already know he is corrupt. His nepotism is blatant. His cronies are given high level positions without being qualified. The nuke deal with Saudi Arabia is full of corruption. He blatantly breaks the emoluments clause of the constitution. Etc. Etc.
Not to mention that they lie. All. The. Time.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:27:38
Maybe you are playing a role of the ignorant gringo because of your username?
@_date: 2019-04-13 17:49:11
Venezuela had something like 1,000,000% inflation in one or two years. If common folks held an inflation proof currency instead of the bolivar they would have kept the purchasing power of their savings instead of losing it all.
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:00:42
Not sure but I read about it here. 
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:51:20
The report has evidence that he is a Russian agent. Assange had access to GRU files that contained stolen emails from the DNC. Then he lied about Seth Rich and made up a hoax to cover his tracks.
Being a Russian agent doesn’t mean being a member of the GRU, it means working to advance Russian interests. It’s clear to anybody that Assange is working to advance Russian interests.
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:21:52
Just because they haven’t charged him with being a Russian agent doesn’t mean they won’t.
He is being charged with hacking a government computer and will be extradited to the US. 
My guess is that the US gov will use the threat of espionage charges to get Assange to talk and to ultimately bring down all the Russian operatives he has been working with.

Of course, didn't mean to belittle the march of progress.
But with your answer in mind, it seems like the tech has to be able to handle mass adoption before it happens, right? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:27:28
Noob question: does Bitcoin have the technical ability to compute hundreds of thousands of transactions a second?

Thanks for the reply. I am still learning about Bitcoin so that is why I qualified my statement as being from an outsider.
I am open to having my views corrected, let me explain my opinions further:




I don't think it is a reliable way to store value because of the volatility. Yes, it is gaining value today, but nobody knows if it will keep going up, crash, level out, or fluctuate wildly forever. Uncertainty is not good if you are looking to safely store your life savings. Now, if you are looking for a high risk/ high reward investment Bitcoin is great.


You say it does. Can you elaborate? I am under the impression that if you want to spend your bitcoin you have to sell in exchanges and deal with fees or do a private auction for under market value. Is there another way to have the value of the Bitcoin available to be used at a moments notice? 


You aren't banking on mass adoption? How come?
I do agree that Bitcoin is ground breaking technology and I want to see it succeed. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:31:19
From an outsider's perspective it seems odd. Bitcoin isn't really a good way to store value because it is volatile and considered risky. Bitcoin also doesn't have good liquidity and it is still a bit technical for the usual consumer. 
At the moment it seems like the majority of the value is based off the market's enthusiasm for Bitcoin, as opposed to Bitcoin's present capabilities.

It's fine to have an opinion based on your gut feelings, but this is clearly an echo chamber. I'm already getting downvoted to hell for saying that maybe it isn't a shitcoin just because it's new and unproven. But no, in this toxic environment everything has to be a shitcoin. There is no nuance to this discussion.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:21:26
Sometimes it seems like people here just look at the name of a project and if it doesn't start with B and ends with itcoin then it is a scam and shitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:59:41
So either new ambitious concepts work perfectly from the start or the are scams? It's a miracle that Bitcoin got off the ground with people like you around.
