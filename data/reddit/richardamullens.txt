The developers are paid by blockstream and have sold their souls for a mess of pottage.

There are lots of core developers working for blockstream and they have sold their souls.  You know it, I know it and everyone else knows it too !
@_date: 2016-04-15 04:10:37
Serious.  Sometimes we have to make compromises when working to support our families but if these developers are so talented, there's no need for them to hijack this revolutionary technology and destroy Satoshi's work.

What was once reliable is now hit and miss.  Bitcoin has been damaged by selfish individuals.  As for decentralisation, I'm no longer mining as it's not clear bitcoin has a future.

It was not an attack, the queues of transactions were the result a number of block solution times of 60 minutes.  When this occurs transaction backlogs build up. It is a statistical phenomenon and can happen at any time and will happen more and more often.  You can see a similar graph at  (look at the size over a 7 day period in the bottom left graph).

At the moment, legitimate transactions are being discouraged by the increase in fees at times of congestion - so people are discouraged from using bitcoin.

Ignorant would perhaps be a better description of you.
@_date: 2016-11-01 01:33:51
Brecause you don't listen perhaps ?
@_date: 2016-11-01 01:14:38
You only have to look around to see that that the rest of the community does not accept your implication that a blocksize increase would make bitcoin vulnerable to attackers, governments and other centralised parties.
@_date: 2016-11-03 08:16:12
pointless talking to you.

For an English person you are not very well educated.
@_date: 2016-11-03 08:14:49
You can be an arrogant idiot all you like but it doesn't alter the fact that many people consider that the biggest threat to bitcoin is not a blocksize increase but the company blockstream and your ilk.

Some say it is because mining pool ViaBTC has declared an interest in Bitcoin Unlimited and in consequence miners who want on chain scaling have moved to that pool.
I don't think that ViaBTC is using BU software yet though.

I recollect Jihan Wu saying that he would not activate segwit unless a Hard Fork increasing the blocksize was also included - so unless you increase the blocksize this all seems rather academic.
@_date: 2016-10-25 23:36:08
Via BTC aren't blocking SegWit.  It isn't even ready.
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:25:47
Please credit us with intelligence.  We don't confuse off and on chain scaling and we know the limited benefits of segregated witness if it is accepted by the miners and the wallet providers.
The real nub of the matter is described in blackmarble's answer to nullc.

I have a 70Mb connection and that is by no means the largest I can afford as a retired person. I can go out and buy a 5TByte drive without any qualms.  The vast majority of the time my bandwidth is underutilised.  When my adult son returns he runs a bitcoin node - it and some film streaming has a negligible effect on responsiveness.  In other words I can run a node with almost zero marginal cost.  The true cost of running a node is the technical effort and ongoing administration required.  I am not inhibited from running a node because of cost but because of the benefit when bitcoin remains hobbled by inadequate transaction bandwidth.

Bitcoin has been taken over by imposters.  At last, Harry Seldon like, Satoshi Nakamoto reappears to correct the course of bitcoin scaling.  It's no wonder that the villans of the piece are in denial.
@_date: 2016-05-21 14:10:03
If transactions do not confirm because blocks are full, people will lose trust in bitcoin and go somewhere else.

China want consensus.  They don't wan't disagreement - but if you threaten the stability of bitcoin you will be ditched in a flash and good riddance in my view.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:21:27
The truth is we don't know who Satoshi is - but many people believe Wright's claim.

With your evident lack of knowledge of the English language, I think we can disregard your analysis of what it says or said on the wikipedia page.
@_date: 2016-07-04 23:05:50
I don't think so. Gavin probably believes it too.
@_date: 2016-07-04 04:53:58
Wrong.  I believe it.
