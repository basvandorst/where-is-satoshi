@_date: 2013-06-13 21:52:31
I agree but they just name all virtual currencies in case some might think that they are not involved in the same regulation. My take is that they want bitcoin to survive and with people registering with fincen it makes the integrity of bitcoin greater.
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:58:30
when did you sign up with them?
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:17:54

We have a batch upload tool where you could upload multiple products at once using a CSV file. You could also add your top 10  or 20 products individually so that you dont need to upload your inventory entirely. If you need any help with adding inventory I will be here to help you out as well :)
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:35:29
how is the withdraw schedule, are you able to convert back to fiat fast? i know with mtgox that is the main issue.
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:18:57
can you load a wallet.dat file onto multibit?
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:38:11

ah i see, so Cointerra is the only bitcoin company filing for IPO then? What the difference between creating an ETF and filing for IPO, (IPO you sell shares of your company) and ETF (you create your own exchange?)
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:46:44

So far our only option is Coinbase, and good luck with their instant approval process, i still havent been verified after trying 3 times. 
Other than that you have localbitcoins as well.
For campbx they dont take wires either.
We really have to fix this, we're making it hard to buy bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-06-09 16:17:09
Yes so rank is a new feature we implemented to rank products on our homepage. To build rank you have to get orders, provide a lot of information about your product, upload high resolution photos, and have high views of your product. What do you currently sell?
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:14:11

@_date: 2013-01-25 16:55:18
I agree with you 100%, every conference ive attended whether for bitcoin or any other industries, the connections and friends I made are worth more than the ticket itself, I plan on going to meet and greet with everyone and put a face to them, I'm not going to sit down the whole time and listen to speakers talk about what we already know online. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:49:33
this is great, have you tried withdrawing by bank yet?
@_date: 2013-07-23 00:10:40
do you want to buy bitcoin or litecoin? also where are you located
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:23:06
i agree, people should offer discounts when selling products for bitcoin, not many have done so but they are definitely starting too. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:55:18
bitmit is more like ebay (auction based) and coingig is more of an amazon (fixed price)
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:14:57
i was going to go but came to the san jose conference instead, let me know when the next one is!
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:51:02

@_date: 2013-02-20 02:29:15
Oh ok, currently i have a light color background which when it fades out makes it hard to read since its almost all faded out most of the time. Also another issue that I have is that i set it to open on startup but it never does, not sure why this is happening.
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:50:58
many sellers that want to sell products for bitcoin can signup with  and create a store in minutes
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:20:29
this is awesome, best buy is going down, i haven't shopped there in ages, I mainly buy all of my stuff on amazon. I recently launched a site called  to make it possible to buy products with bitcoin, we have around 400 products that have been listed by sellers but with the daily growth we've been having we will be able to provide a big list of inventory soon so it can be your one stop shop to purchase goods with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:54:07
people are buying stuff on  
@_date: 2013-05-31 00:13:19

@_date: 2013-07-15 00:36:38

you can setup a store on  it would a lot easier and you can reach more customers
@_date: 2013-08-01 20:11:09

@_date: 2013-04-16 18:40:31
I agree
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:44:51
you asked for merchants to submit their website, coingig is a marketplace for sellers to post their products
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:58:02
this is so cool, i havent seen many 3d guys put their products for sale for bitcoin, really weird. you should open a store on  and reach a bigger customer base :)
@_date: 2013-07-10 23:37:19
I agree, could you recommend some tips besides having a complex password and enabling google authenticator? do you keep your bitcoins inside campbx always? or do you transfer them out as soon as possible?
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:23:57
hah thats true
@_date: 2013-06-18 21:03:13
So this order came from a different seller, Jakes_Asics, not from RunBTC.
All buyers are allowed to place reviews on any product regardless if they have escrow on or off, this can be done in the buy orders tab when you login. The reason why you cannot leave a review right now is because we have closed Jakes_Asics store and removed his products.
Our policy can be found here,  which is on our homepage, on the support page that policy is outdated and I have just modified it with our new one.
We are completely sorry for this terrible issue that has come up, we are working on this so that we can prevent it from ever happening again.
I have contacted you directly so we are able to keep you updated.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:54:27
you guys can setup a store on  and sell your jewelry these aswell
@_date: 2013-06-06 15:27:48

@_date: 2013-09-20 03:44:06
upgrade to the new version, samething happened to me
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:55:17
Hi Mememtori, I am one of the owners of Coingig, I have contacted the seller, we have all of the sellers information so we are going to report him if this is correct.
@_date: 2013-08-28 15:20:06
hah awesome
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:47:27
Good question, so with coingig you are able to create an actual store and promote your business by adding your store logo, adding multiple social channels, having a custom url. Bitmit has slightly more traffic than Coingig but both are very popular. Having a website is also beneficial, many businesses have both their own website and also list their products on multiple marketplaces. You can see Coingig as more of an Amazon as oppose to Bitmit which is more similar to Ebay where it's auction based.
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:38:04
So it is a marketplace for people to sell products to any country, it does not have to ship to US customers.
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:13:45
yea i just got the newest version 8.4
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:19:51
you should register on  to have an official store and sell from there
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:15:13
my team and I launched a new website called  it is a great place to spend your bitcoins, we have many products and growing daily, there is a lot you can buy with bitcoin now. It allows stores to open up an account and sell their products. Check us out! :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:05:00
A great alternative is  the majority of all sellers are moving their inventory over.
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:32:05
im having this issue also, there are apparently banking issues that have nothing to do with coinbase.
@_date: 2013-05-08 02:11:23
 woo! :)
@_date: 2013-09-30 18:25:36
is 50btc instant buy ever coming back?
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:53:21
thats so cool haha
@_date: 2013-09-09 20:40:12
you should add a store on  to sell these, they look super cool!
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:25:11
great idea! it's best to get people to change the wifi name in public/popular places where they offer free wifi. such as pubs, restaurants, etc that take btc
@_date: 2013-06-26 13:34:04
if you are selling products you can setup a store on 
@_date: 2013-06-04 20:38:39

you can also sell your magic products on 
@_date: 2013-03-15 19:18:04
My response from them:
Thanks for reaching out and for taking the time to send along your feedback. Although we don't accept Bitcoin as a form of payment on the site, I'll pass the suggestion along to the rest of the team that there's interest in having it as a feature. At Kickstarter we are constantly working to improve the experience for both our backers and creators. Community feedback like this is what keeps us motivated. Thanks for being a thoughtful backer and member of the Kickstarter community.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:42:17

@_date: 2013-07-29 23:34:42
they should open a store on  too so they can be the leader in bitcoin baby products
@_date: 2013-10-15 01:35:27
if you sell products online you can setup a store on 
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:03:36
that is true, you got a point. hopefully the investors realize the potential and invest in actual bitcoin also, this could also cause the twins to purchase more bitcoins if the demand is high.
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:04:29
anyone have a link for the october bitcoin conference in atlanta?
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:51:00
my guess is that they aren't considered an exchange but just an online wallet
@_date: 2013-08-09 16:22:50
love this guy, hes good
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:10:23
i would recommend coinbase.com, as they are located in the US and are pretty good.
@_date: 2013-07-11 02:51:42
is Coinlab.com an exchange also? Has anyone used them? What makes them different?
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:15:59
this is a great alternative, but if you want to setup a store with fast and easy setup you can sign up with  and not rely on bitpay or having any web development knowledge
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:21:36
you can buy products on 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:24:28
you can also setup a store on  and sell your products on there as well!
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:45:50
@_date: 2013-07-16 01:13:46
is this real? how does this work?
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:19:39
yea too many damn facebook questions, the interviewer should have been punched. they answered all the questions very well, i just wish there were more bitcoin questions.
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:06:50

@_date: 2013-07-03 13:17:49
@_date: 2013-09-17 00:41:18
have you guys thought of opening a store on  you can capture a larger buyer audience
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:32:15

@_date: 2013-07-15 19:50:03

@_date: 2013-09-13 15:55:19

@_date: 2013-05-29 15:16:45

@_date: 2013-07-06 21:26:50

@_date: 2013-05-24 17:03:14

@_date: 2013-08-30 00:54:05

@_date: 2013-04-23 21:12:24
you should post up yours
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:31:24
really cool clips! you should open a store on  and add have another place to distribute your product.
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:50:41
whether bitcoin drops to $5 tomorrow, i have already lost my trust with banks and would much rather keep my cash in a virtual currency i can take with me anywhere in the world and be my own bank, something so revolutionary as the internet won't come around again for decades to come.
@_date: 2013-07-13 01:09:56
hm im a bit confused, if you can help me that would be awesome. Right now I'm not verified with any exchange, I'm still waiting with Campbx, Bitstamp, and MtGox. I want to day trade with large volume of bitcoin per day, which route should I go?
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:07:47
looking good!
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:03:49
this is awesome
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:14:06
thats awesome, congrats! It has grown to a very popular game, it will definitely go mainstream soon. By the way, are you guys taking any sponsors inside the game?
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:47:08
you should sell this on 
@_date: 2013-07-24 18:58:33
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:24:26
Coingig.com - The Bitcoin Marketplace :)
@_date: 2013-07-15 16:12:11
actually no, i can't even get passed step 1 which is a simple questionnaire about your name and address. Which neither of them have never changed, their support doesnt help me at all get passed this problem, they don't take ID or utility bills, and they expect me to keep using them after they have made a ton of money off of me for all the bitcoins i purchase and they can't help me get passed a simple problem.
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:07:12
Thanks for that, I will try that to see if it works!
@_date: 2013-07-29 23:38:21
where did you buy it?
@_date: 2013-07-10 03:55:19
I'm not too sure about it, it's hard for them keep up the zero % markup thing for long, last i heard they didnt reach their goal
@_date: 2013-05-26 22:04:56
go coingig! :)
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:20:43
this is the best route to go, i trust bitstamp
@_date: 2013-06-18 22:51:00
After investigating further into this seller, he is indeed a scammer and the buyer is being honest. We have tried to email him multiple times and it looks that now he has deactivated his email since it keeps getting bounced back and it is not deliverable. Here is the sellers blockchain address as well that we have paid him at  he appears to be receiving funds from faucets as well. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:04:06
we're all getting there!
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:25:58
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:21:15

@_date: 2013-09-11 21:27:27
does bitstamp has the licenses and all to be able to work with users in the US? Something that MtGox was shut down over here for
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:48:48
i saw that they are located in the UK, are they really from slovenia? were ultimately trusting the web and their reputation when we sign up with them and give our money.

I love your first part, I have a similar setup, which is honestly the best way to stay secure.
For the second part, that is good if I decide not to trade that day or that week its better to transfer out the bitcoins, great idea. Thanks for that, I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-06-29 03:28:33
Thank you for the support! We wanted to build a great service that we know the bitcoin community will need and do the best we can to contribute to this economy. Even though our idea/service isn't something revolutionary, bitcoin is, so we built a new business with an old business model, like you said. We look forward to building our business and providing the best customer service possible!
@_date: 2013-10-15 22:37:06
 has a ton of stores that all do international shipping
@_date: 2013-08-14 03:15:52
have you created a wallet yet? for new people i would suggest setting up an account with coinbase.com and you can get a better grasp on how it all works. once you sign up with them they give you a wallet address which is used to accept payments, consider this like your "email address" where people can send you bitcoins
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:25:38
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:36:01
oh great, yea the first time you input your address the system will automatically create you an account and send you an email with your temporary password, it could be in your email, maybe in the spam folder.
Yea we agree, we will be looking into that and find a better solution to make it easier to read, thanks for pointing that out!
@_date: 2013-08-09 16:23:30
this is great!
@_date: 2013-05-12 16:31:33
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:33:36
there are many shirts for sale on  and its all btc based. OP should setup a store on here also.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:18:00
how would this work, does it charge automatically after giving permission? do you have to have a balance with coinbase?
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:35:47
is there a limit for withdrawing bitcoin with non-verified account? since i plan on converting back to fiat with coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-22 04:03:40
a lot of small businesses are opening shop at 
@_date: 2013-06-06 23:16:26
oh really? you might have already be registered, you can try the forgot your password at login to retrieve your password.
How long ago did you receive this error, do you remember what it said?
@_date: 2013-07-26 01:23:59
yea sometimes it takes 30 mins for it to send over 
@_date: 2013-07-31 01:05:05

@_date: 2013-07-01 22:22:10
I agree with you here, but then again some people would rather just buy physical precious metals instead of ETFs, in the same way any user could buy "actual" bitcoins instead of paper bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-24 00:33:40
great site!
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:14:16

@_date: 2013-04-17 20:29:47
we just finished upgrading our site with the following:
1) Coingig has taken the proactive steps at improving the performance of our site and recently implemented SQLAlchemy as our backbone database framework. This framework is used by many major sites such as Yelp, Reddit, and Dropbox. This upgrade will allow us to introduce new and exciting features for buyers and help sellers increase future sales.
2) Password field can now support special characters so users can ensure their account is secure.
3) Email field for login is no longer case sensitive so you can login in all CAPS.
4) Product title and description now allows the use of all common punctuations such as . ? ! : ; - ( ) ' / , &amp; $ * _
5) We have updated our FAQ page with more questions for new and existing users, coingig.com/faq
6) To everyone that needs support or has a question please don't hesitate to look at our support page support.coingig.com for any unanswered questions or to post one that we have not provided.

as far as i read its all by wire to deposit or withdraw, unless you use sepa which im guessing is another form of bank transfer.
@_date: 2013-07-13 00:23:49
got it, and if you want to withdrawal bitcoins to another wallet does that limit still apply?
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:19:40
please explain
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:40:13
I hope it stays stable, keep the speculators out and let bitcoin businesses run smoothly.
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:12:45
you can use  and post up your inventory there as well
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:27:42

I think I have the most fun whenever i send payments, it's so fast and seamless there is no doubt that bitcoin is going to change the way we use money. don't want to sound spammy but I have a site called  where sellers come and list their products for sale. You should check it out and see if there is anything you like :)
@_date: 2013-07-13 22:45:51

@_date: 2013-05-23 18:00:32

@_date: 2013-07-12 15:38:59

@_date: 2013-07-13 18:31:38
I would prefer a good US trading platform since none exist
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:42:34

@_date: 2013-05-06 23:23:17

@_date: 2013-04-12 17:15:12
So are we! 
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:17:52
how do you guys deal with chargebacks?
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:54:47
this is a really cool idea, but id rather pay for an app and be able to add the addresses that i want the balance to since i have multiple wallets. right now im using btcbalance.net, its decent but if you can come up with a cool app like that site, i will buy it.
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:21:57
anyone in the world can make a store easily using  and start accepting bitcoins for their products. they can also set shipping for any country they wish to send to.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:27:19
oh awesome, yea thats what I meant, im sure you guys will be getting tons of people that want to advertise on it. please let me know when thats ready so i can check it out :)

@_date: 2013-07-30 02:24:32
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:10:34

@_date: 2013-08-28 15:39:16
that tells us that when they do bitcoins will be at $1000
@_date: 2013-07-24 03:33:41
you guys should sell on  too
@_date: 2013-06-18 21:39:05
To prevent this from happening again is to have all sellers have escrow turned on and we will need to wait for buyers to receive the item and leave a review before we can release payment. This can also become a difficulty if the buyer actually receives the item and says they didn't and say they got some other product instead. With this in mind we are going to work on a full proof system to stop this from ever happening again.
@_date: 2013-07-30 22:39:44
thanks for this service!
@_date: 2013-06-18 20:11:29
We have recently updated our refund policy 2 weeks ago to help avoid this issue if it ever came up and it seems like it did. We only issue refunds to buyers if they purchase from sellers that have Escrow turned on. For those that have it off we cannot refund them. In your case we cannot refund you and can only block that seller and publish all of his details on the internet for everyone to see. You said that the first product you purchased from him was real? 
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:14:34
even though my mac is new, it could be a bug with bitcoinqt

@_date: 2013-06-12 00:38:22
@_date: 2013-08-21 03:47:36

@_date: 2013-05-31 16:35:55
thats awesome, congrats! this is your first of many more once you get hooked on it. you should open a store on  you'll like it
@_date: 2013-07-14 21:03:18
I am in the same boat as you, where are you located?
Its becoming rather difficult to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-11 02:04:40
thats really cool, they should open a store on  also
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:40:44
not bad, do you have a verified account?
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:50:02
would love to get something like this involved in Miami, Florida. Any advice on how to get this setup?
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:19:10
thanks for noticing that! we just fixed it :)
@_date: 2013-07-12 03:16:27
@_date: 2013-08-25 21:56:12
who do they host with?
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:28:21
we do charge a fee, but when compared to big sites like amazon and ebay we are significantly less. With these fees that we will charge it will go towards unlimited image storage, unlimited inventory for sellers, better reporting and analytics for products, increased bandwidth and security. These upgrades will all be benefited by the users.
@_date: 2013-07-15 19:52:30
is it hard to search for products?
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:55:24
oh wow, thats awesome lol. hopefully they actually read these surveys
@_date: 2013-09-05 18:40:21
whatever happens, BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2013-06-08 21:58:35
Hi Joe,
I think the reason why you got a refund was because the payment amount sent for the order was not complete. If the amount doesn't match with the order we will refund the buyer. You could try again and send the full amount to get the item sent to you.
