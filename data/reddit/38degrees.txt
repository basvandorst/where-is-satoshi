That's a simplistic way of looking at it. They _can_ have those things because in reality banks have not been private enterprises for a long time, there is a symbiotic relation between every major bank and the government.
The bank received a fuckload of welfare, and we can safely assume this was not the first time they "blackmailed" the state.
Whatever people want to call this system, whether crony-capitalism, socialism-communism, fascism, doesn't matter, but it's not a private bank operating in a free market.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:57:44
The thing with decentralized exchanges is that they can be covered by one million regulations, but there is nobody to regulate. Once LN works smoothly, the only bottle neck is the legacy fiat system, which cannot prevent you from wiring money to another person unless we go full totalitarian. I won't exclude that possibility, but it will only drive an even bigger wedge into the already polarized positions between people who love to regulate every aspect of other people's lives and those of us who care for our freedom.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:36:39
Your assumption is backwards.
Segwit is active on the blockchain and LN uses Segwit transactions, but LN does not require Segwit adoption to be able to use it.

Use a decentralized exchange like Bisq. Unfortunately being legit is making yourself a target and potentially things will get a lot worse from here on, before they get better.

As another poster points out in this thread, the definition of money transmitter is intentionally so vague, that it can be made applicable to anything.

LN is a new layer on top of Bitcoin, so if one of the wallets does not implement the LN protocol, it won't be able to participate (on that protocol level).
Think of the internet, which uses TCP/IP on top of Ethernet. Bitcoin is Ethernet and Bitcoin nodes can communicate in the raw Bitcoin protocol, or use LN (the TCP/IP of the Bitcoin protocol).

I'll stick to vague. If a good bunch of intelligent people cannot figure out what is required (which most discussions on the subject prove), the law is not clearly expressed (as in the definition of vague).
If it is supposed to be all-encompassing, you could describe that in a clear way. You could write it like: anyone who receives and transmits anything to anyone by any means is a money transmitter.

We seem to agree. I neither claim that banks are states. Just that both institutions are in a complex, symbiotic relationship. Neither government nor banks could be doing the harm they are doing without each other.

I am very aware that is how every common form of governance works. Bitcoin is however not governed that way. It is (maybe the only remaining) true free market. A free market is defined by voluntary interaction. As soon as you introduce force and coercion it is no longer a free market. Maybe that is the way Bitcoin will go. We'll see. If so, I predict most people who made it what it is today will drop it like a hot potato and look for the next voluntary currency.

Ah the cult cop out. Nice. You're still working off of your checklist I see.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:24:55
The ideal decentralized situation for Bitcoin is when there are many independent miners. For many reasons it has already significantly shifted from thousands of independent miners towards bigger and bigger mining companies. 
(The reason we are even having this discussion is because a few big mining companies can block what the overwhelming majority of users wants.)
When you increase the block size this will not really hurt big mining companies but it will hurt small miners, driving even more of them out of the market and thus you are decreasing decentralization.
The price is really not worth it at the moment, especially when there are other scaling options available which don't hurt small miners.

It would be an interesting experiment. My guess is that most miners would come back to mine BTC within a week, as the new BU altcoin they started mining plummets in value. The economic majority does not want BU and will not support its price. So they would be burning electricity for a worthless token and either have to come back to BTC or go bankrupt. Money talks.

@_date: 2017-03-24 11:11:21
Yes but we were not arguing about whether anyone can leave or not.
Okay I was referring to the economic majority as users, but sure miners are users too, let me try to clarify the point I was trying to make. Bitcoin as a whole is a free market, but the mining ecosystem within Bitcoin is not. Miners create blocks but do not have to store them, so you may run into the Tragedy of the commons, i.e. a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:43:05

Bitfinex allows you to split 1 BTC into 1 BCC (Core) and 1 BCU (Unlimited).
You may also do the reverse and combine them back into BTC. These tokens can be bought and sold on the market. Current prices are BCU ~180$ and BCC ~800$
BCC will automatically become BTC after 31st December 2017.
BCU will become
a) worthless after 31st December 2017 if no hardfork
b) If hardfork: BTU/BTC-unlimited (also worthless IMHO)

This is not about big mining companies hurting small miners but about decentralization.
Increasing the block size hurts small miners more than big mining companies, which will lead to less decentralization.
Think of a mining company in China for example, who has a fast internet connection. Downloading the new blocks of a few megabyte every 10 minutes in a couple of seconds is a not big deal.
Now compare a small independent miner in a less developed part of the world for example. Or your neighbor who has a few miners in the garage as a hobby. They have a slow internet connection or need to share it with the rest of the family, but can still compete today, with 1 megabyte blocks every 10 minutes. If the block size increases, they will still be downloading the last block to work on or block the internet connection, while the big miner has already solved the next one.

**Every** user node decides for itself which consensus rules to follow. So yes, some miners can choose to adopt new rules and start mining a new block chain. Just like every other user node (currently &gt;90% of user nodes run Core and less than 3% run BU) can choose to ignore it and stick to the current consensus rules. Then the free market will decide which chain it values more. It would be very disruptive and messy, but I could live with that.

SegWit is the best tested solution to allow necessary upgrades to the protocol and bugfixes all in one package. It effectively increases the block size and will allow new features to be introduced that can even further scale Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:18:09
This is it. Developers have influence, not control. Like it should be, they can influence users with reason to choose which client to run. That is what they have done and the overwhelming majority chooses the Core client.

I don't think that is even close to enough for such a controversial issue. And even if, you cannot provide an optional feature that changes the consensus rules of a decentralized network without breaking the network.

They are [Chain Split Tokens](
You split your BTC into BCC+BCU and sell the BCU. The BCC will revert to BTC in the future as per the contract in the link (or you exchange them back to BTC on the market before that).
They are like futures on BTU/Rogercoin. If you want to sell them before they go to zero, this works fine. People are still paying around $175 for one Rogercoin, already down from $300 a few days ago.
Edit: Make that $167
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:32:20


Yes, you also have to account for the trading fees and order book depth.
BCU/BTC has the most liquidity atm, so if I had more BTC to spare I would split them and dump the BCU for BTC on that market for a nice 10-20% profit. Keep the BCC and sell them later or wait until they expire back to BTC.

We normally use the word politics to refer to how people feel matters should be governed by a perceived authority. In an open source community there is no authority to govern matters. There can only be leaders. Politicians/rulers govern and their subjects have to obey. Leaders merely lead, and people are free to follow or not.

Bitcoins price is floating freely - Tether claims to be pegged to USD. To achieve that, they would have to have $1 in stock for every coin out there. Which they claim to have, but I would be highly skeptical of that claim until I could verify it.
They are also centralized, which throws the most important advantage of a cryptocurrency out of the window, and makes them as vulnerable as companies like eGold and Liberty Reserve, which were taken down by the US government.
If you want a crypto pegged to the USD, look at NuBits, who uses a very intelligent system with shareholders and interest rates to peg its value to the USD. I do not condone putting much money into it tough, because it is all just a concept.

Bitcoin is a protocol. Core and Unlimited (and Knots, Bitcoinj and at least 10 others) are clients. A protocol is not planned, it is designed. The reason it is hard to change is because it breaks the network that all client implementations connect to. With TCP/IP the packet size has a maximum, but you wouldn't call TCP/IP centralized.

I agree, the core issue (pun intended) seems to be in the mindset of the supporters from both camps.
Whereas the original Bitcoin supporters and experts understand that decentralization is the most valuable asset that Bitcoin has, the other camp, in their unlimited stupidity, seems to think that reducing decentralization by increasing the costs to run a full node, at this point in time, with attacks coming from all sides (and IMO it hasn't even truly started yet) is even an option.

Great, we agree that it is already possible to change consensus rules on an individual basis, by changing the source code and recompiling.
And we seem to agree that it would break the network ("it will make your node dysfunctional").
Isn't this what has already happened hundreds of times when altcoins are created?
Do I understand your proposal is to make it explicit in the GUI (like a setting in the preferences dialog or a big slider)?
Depending on what setting(s) I predict that the result would be thousands of hard forks (altcoins) immediately.
Even if people could somehow come to a consensus which one of those is still Bitcoin, I really have a hard time imagining how this would not result in a big mess with thousands of valueless cryptocoins.
On the other hand, nobody is stopping anyone to fork Bitcoin and implement it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:56:53

Edit: I am sorry we couldn't fulfill your expectations and summarize discussions of the past years in a few reddit posts for you, your highness....
Block size increase is linearly scalable compared to exponentially, which is bad by itself, but in the meantime it also hurts decentralization which is very much needed to guard against all kinds of attacks that will be coming.
Block size increase is like putting a larger engine in your car, while Segwit is tuning the engine to get more performance and LN is putting it in an airplane.

You talk about a schism in the community, but I think we are way beyond that.
When Bitcoin was invented, there obviously was a homogenous community of people with the same values and goals. But that has long been diluted by a huge influx of, frankly, people with less and sometimes completely wrong understanding of technology or economics.
By now the people involved are way too diverse, with different values and goals, to be talking about a community.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:40:33
I think it is a social attack, arguably the worst one so far, but I don't see it as a bad thing. This is all expected, if it has value it will be attacked. Bitcoin is very valuable and that is only slowly being recognized by the public. If Bitcoin cannot survive this, it isn't decentralized or strong enough. But I think it is, and after it has survived it will again be much stronger and we will all be much wiser.

Let's imagine I fork off the main chain tomorrow because I want 128MB blocks. My new hardfork won't be used by anyone so eventually the difficulty drops through the floor. Now anyone can generate 10 blocks per minute on a laptop and my hardfork will have a longer chain than Bitcoin.

To add to the irony of it all, this is exactly the same way Central Banks work (and the reason Bitcoin was invented): print a lot more money than is warranted to prop up the currency.
Of course we all know that the difference is that with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Crash, unlike with Central Banks, there is eventually a limit to the inflation. Would be interesting to see how Bcash handles that without increasing fees. Maybe they come up with an EIA (Emergency Inflation Adjustment).

Thanks I didn't realize that is how it works.
Antpool does mine SegWit transactions it seems, like in blocks 481953 and 481939. Both blocks are not completely full though. So that invalidates the theory that they are still using ASICBOOST.
It could be a misconfiguration issue (in general or after disabling ASICBOOST) now that SegWit has activated. But how come it takes so long to fix?
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:59:24
Just a quick and dirty calculation of how much profit in fees they lost:
(4 x 100 kB + 6 x 1,000 kB) @ 400 sat/byte = 2,560,000,000 satoshi
25.6 BTC @ 4,000 USD = 102,400 USD
Nice one!
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:32:39
Upstream is probably a lot less. Still he will not be running a full node for very long if blocks get up to 8MB and your internet connection gets blocked every now and then because of the heavy traffic.

First Segwit is an upgrade to use the available space more effectively. Second everyone is going to be able to create payment hubs, that offload small transactions from the main blockchain. It doesn't make sense to save every small transactions on hundred thousands computers worldwide until eternity. If it were even possible. Every transaction takes at least 10 MB worldwide. Suppose every coffee purchase were to be saved.... That is madness.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:59:46
To do it correctly, you'd have to look at the mempool distribution at the time the respective blocks were mined. My calculation underestimates the missed transactions but overestimated the fees so yours is probably fairer. I'd say a figure between 125k and 150k should be correct.

In the end it is much more profitable. And as a plus you no longer have to feed the craving for attention of the average Bcash warrior. Just let the free market do it's work. It has a long track record of rewarding the smart and crushing the stupid.
As you said, if prices stay where they are now, in 13 hours it will be 4x more profitable to mine Bitcoin anyway. In the meantime, extracting value from the new chain lowers the price and makes mining it even less profitable. We'll see if it can become profitable again, how soon and for how long, but if it does, it will be difficulty raped into oblivion again. Bcash doesn't stand a change if they compete for POW with Bitcoin.

Bcash will hardfork to remove EDA sooner rather than later anyway. In the meantime and after that there will be more hype and crash cycles.
I think there is a better and ultimately more effective way.
You can defend Bitcoin by using the invisible hand of the market. If you believe Bcash has no long term value, as do I, in other words, the market is irrational right now, then the market will eventually adjust to that. You can use that to your advantage by selling your Bcash for Bitcoin (no naked shorting). If you are good at it, you can use the pump and dump cycles to extract even more value from Bcash holders.

Not at all because the rules don't apply to the rulers and their cronies. So it is quite natural to see more money flowing to the top when things get more centralized. Which is, as you said, what we are seeing.
I don't mind the terms left and right, but these words have lost their original meanings so it is hard to have a meaningful discussion about it. The differences between the new meaning of left and right has become very small and above that it doesn't consider any other options.

That the amount of transactions is still low, but climbing way too fast in my opinion. This link shows even better that something is not right, the blocksize hangs around 2MB.

Shapshit has still not fully implemented Segwit after months, which if they did would immediately reduce the fee pressure for all of us.


The contrary is true, in a free market it is imperative that people call out bad actors to inform others so they can also make an informed decision.


This is definitely not about a blocksize increase and never has been. The fact that you say this makes you look very uninformed.

Ok good luck. If not running Windows eliminates the problem, I would take it step by step from there. First maybe start Windows in safe mode and shut down. Then check again. Then start Windows normally and shut down without running any other programs. Check again. That way you can easier try to find the program that messes with the disk or directory that contains the datadir.

Yes, something like 100 blocks on the 2X chain have to be mined within 2 weeks is what I heard. If not, the deal is cancelled.
In other words, if 2X is succesful, Roger wins. If not, his opponents lose.
(That is not even considering the opportunity costs they incur. While the rest of us may get lucky and be able to sell 2X coins on an exchange, they have to keep their coins locked up).
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:52:55

I guess you could start with the BIP:
And some general technical information about Segwit:
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:26:56
But if she had looked into Bitcoin and had actually understood what it was, she would have understood that the price would probably go much higher. At least that is the conclusion many early adopters reached and were proven to be right about. Instead she brushed it aside by default ("as if" I said) like most people in 2014.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:08:28




Okay this gives you a clue that the problem is with you 'chainstate' directory. Maybe check permissions, available disk space, is it in the default location (~/.bitcoin/chainstate) ?


Although this refers to another directory ~/.bitcoin/blocks
Another thing to check is if you are not running other (bitcoin) software on the same directory that could corrupt your databases (Segwit2X, Bitcoin 0.14)

I don't have to answer to you, bro. I consider it a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:00:03
This has been discussed a lot in the past. One of the most quoted research papers is this one afaik:


Segwit is a gradual blocksize increase up to 4MB.
Segwit2X doubles that to 8MB.

What really pisses me off is that there are people _actually_ being censored today in the world. Some are paying with their lives.
Folks who use an appeal to emotion by conflating fair moderation on an internet forum with censorship, are discrediting real victims of censorship by inflating the word censorship for their petty political games.

@_date: 2017-11-04 23:59:24
Well yes, the increase in price has been predicted despite the nay-sayers through the years. Everybody knew it could also go down, and it did a couple of times, but it was either 0 or a moonshot and the odds were and still are very much in favor of the latter. I should know, because I have been following it since before that time and you obviously haven't.

@_date: 2017-11-05 18:23:01
I would check first if the problem is gone without switching from Windows to Ubuntu. If so, there is something funky going on in Windows that corrupts the datadir. If you ran Bitcoin Core 0.14.x on it, for example, that would absolutely corrupt the chainstate directory because 0.15 switched to a new format.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:16:30
Bitcoin Core v0.15.x supports Segwit from the command line already. GUI integration was planned for v0.15.1 but had to be postponed to deal with extra defenses that had to be prioritized due to the 2X hardfork shitshow.
You may thank any of [the people and companies who are pushing for the NYA and Segwit2X]( for that.

No that is not normal. They should pay an appropriate fee and use the new and more efficient transaction format, but they may be underpaying to push for a Bitcoin fork they support.
The seller should be able to show you the transaction ID or you should see an incoming transaction on your receiving Bitcoin address. If you post it here (only if you don't mind the privacy loss!), then people can check the fee.

I didn't say anything because it has all been discussed ad nauseum already.
SW is a blocksize of 2-4 MB depending on the kind of transactions. We'll have to wait and see how this plays out when wallets have enabled SW. Then implement Schnorr, MAST and LN before making a decision about further blocksize increases.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:37:46
It smells like a fraud because it is a fraud, though not the futures themselves but the whole concept of 2X was flawed, that is why I'd call it a scam/fraud. The majority in the space, including all leading experts, have been tirelessly saying that since the inception of 2X. It didn't stop a lot of people from gambling, but that is on them.
I agree that the people who have been pushing 2X until the end deserve the disrespect their have earned.

1. Yes I would support another blocksize increase if the core developers are in agreement that it is safe.
2. I don't think anyone knows at this point. There are so many variables and new things in the pipeline that could affect the outcome.
Note that the reason most wallets don't have Segwit support yet and the reason development resources are taken away from implementing all the good stuff in general, is because of the attacks/forks that are happening. So it is kind of ironic that those forkers are pointing their fingers.

The growing size of the blockchain is a nuisance, but the real bottleneck for running/syncing a full node is CPU and bandwidth (network) usage and the size of the database for unspent coins that your node has to store.
The blocksize is a cap on the amount that all of those can grow and is in fact already too high to stay within the average increase that computer hardware capabilities grow.
Increasing the blocksize even further decreases the number of people who can and are willing to run a full node.

So it looks like they finally did after people kept nagging them for months. Maybe if they were more active in the community instead of attacking it and calling everyone toxic I would have noticed.


It is not. Many 2X supporters even publicly admit this.


Core is the leading software client that implements the Bitcoin protocol. But Core developers do not decide the Bitcoin consensus rules. Even if all those experts that have been building the leading software client didn't have valid technical arguments against 2X, they understand that they cannot make an agreement on behalf of all users. That is something that NYA/2X supporters obviously don't understand. Which is why at this point I would prefer it if 2X supporters just fork their altcoin and leave Bitcoin altogether.

I've noticed other high correlations between Segwit2X proponents and (with no connection intended) irrationality, agreeableness, emotional/virtue-signaling individualities and managerial/non-technical backgrounds.
The divide in my opinion is primarily driven by philosophical/political differences over the technical ones, although the latter is what is being focused on. That is why any hope of reconciliation is unlikely unless taboos are identified and confronted (the same issue plagues contemporary society).
Nobody so far is able or dares to analyze that mine-field, but it is clear to me that the fork wars and Segwit2X in particular are not really about technical implementation details of the Bitcoin protocol.

Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 already disconnects 2X nodes, unless they hide their identity. Nothing you can do against that right now. After the fork they will obviously be disconnected.
Upgrade to 0.15.1 for even better defense against malicious nodes. It is currently available as release candidate on

Different developers are forced to deal with different stuff due to these hardforks.
Like for example implementing replay protections, chain splitting tokens and futures (exchanges), emergency upgrades to deal with fork attacks on the network (Bitcoin Core), public developers are facing daily social attacks by trolls, etc. etc. etc.
Segwit support has been implemented on the command line level in Bitcoin Core since 0.15, but the GUI is not ready. That was planned for 0.15.1 but thanks to 2X this has been postponed to 0.15.2 at least.
All in all the amount of man hours the community has wasted are beyond imagination.

Great that you found it! You can save your setting in bitcoin.conf in the datadir. However if you start bitcoind/bitcoin-qt with a non-default datadir, you need to tell it at start-up on the command line where to look. That's unfortunate, but I never heard of a different way to do it, except to compile Bitcoin Core yourself with a different default datadir.

Hmm that's about 24k BTC.
The buying of BCH has been relentless for the past weeks. I don't know about other exchanges or BCH pairs, but I follow the Bitfinex BCH/BTC pair. The buy orders are constantly being topped up, the bid depth never goes below 4000 (nor above 6000) above 0.10. Someone must already be burning money. I have no idea how to approximate how much tough.

This is not just having a change made without their approval. It is a major engineering decision. They have made elaborate arguments for years why this change will destroy the long-term vision many have for Bitcoin.

Am I right that if you had only a few % of the BTC hash power, you could send BCH to an exchange, wait for the deposit to clear, sell it for BTC and withdraw, and then reverse the payment by producing a longer chain without the transaction (aka 51% attack)?
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:24:45
Storing and securing the blockchain worldwide across thousands of computers costs real money. This has to be paid for by the block reward + the transaction fees. The block reward is inflating the supply of Bitcoins, so holders pay it as their Bitcoins value is diluted. The transaction fees are paid by the people who use the service of the miners.
So the cons of higher transaction fees are obvious, it costs more to transact. The pros are that the blockchain is more secure, less chance of manipulation. If you are storing or transacting lots of money, that is kind of important to you.
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:51:10
As an anarchist you can also be expected to have moral decency. You have a choice, you either accept open source rules and you can use the code, or you don't use it.
But those people aren't anarchists anyway. So in this case, I don't see a problem if state force was used against them.

Fees are not really that high. They have been dropping steadily the last week. Transactions with 20-30 sat/byte are being confirmed. Segwit is being rolled out and currently around 1% so that should lower them even further.
Does your wallet allow you to set the fee manually?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:13:55
Yes that is a real possibility. And it should frighten you. It tells you a lot about the American government, which should frighten you even more.

The reason to compare 2 different time frames was to be able to early spot a trend.
If you don't like my comparison of 24-hour-average and 10-block-average, here is an update. It is now 18 hours after I posted this. The 3-hour-average of SegWit transactions is now also higher than the 3-hour-average of BCH transactions. The 24-hour-averages are closing in very fast.

You are right, I was looking at the current hash rate ratio (1%) but should be looking at difficulty ratio (15%) (which under normal circumstances would find an equilibrium at the same percentage? Not sure)

It was an attempt at sarcasm, like OP.
But seriously, this is what I take away from most of the high fee complainers. They want free stuff and offload the costs to others. In case of Bcash, the transaction costs are shifted to the hodlers (through extra inflation of the money supply) and the yet less tangible cost of centralization.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:50:48

Can't you though? You can always do a double spend before the locked transaction becomes valid. Unless your hodl strategy involves throwing away the private key.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:22:42
So 8 transactions can fill a block.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:02:06
Then you are going to have to wait a long time if you don't have them at an exchange yet.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:58:08
Thanks for confirming that. Why in the hell would any exchange support this crap? At HitBTC you can trade after 2 confirmations (last time I checked). That is a HUGE risk. They could be bankrupted with a few hours.

Does not mean you cannot warn other people about obvious conflicts of interest. That is the ethical thing to do.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:37:32


I know, but even with 12 confirmations it is currently trivial to rewrite the BCH transaction history, if you had a couple of percent of the BTC hashing power.

Ok, what would you like to hear my view on exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:57:12
Actually it is dis-inflationary. It has 5-10% inflation per year atm I believe. But we don't see that in the price because demand is growing much faster.
I have always wondered why people thought this is a problem. Either your wealth gets destroyed through inflation or it doesn't. Easy choice. You just have to think harder before you buy stuff or save your money until you really want it. Why would that be a bad thing?

I think you miss the point that there is no consensus for S2X. None whatsoever. It's not about being difficult to achieve, it's just not there and won't be, because a huge portion of the users and all developers are against it.

I've tried it myself a couple of times for the lulz. There is a reason they don't engage in discord: because they can't. Big blocks means small minds. Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:29:25
The network was probably being spammed while simultaneously an exploit in the software of the Bcash network made it possible for miners to temporarily earn more by mining on the Bcash network. That slowed down the generation of new blocks on the Bitcoin network. Combined this caused a large backlog of transactions in the mempool.
Another reason is that a protocol upgrade called Segwit is slowly being adopted that makes it possible to include more transactions per block.

It doesn't really matter to Bitcoin what a large number of people wants. This is not a democracy. If there is no 100% support by all users (consensus) there cannot be a hardfork. The definition of a hardfork is an incompatible change to the rules that everybody follows. If not everybody follows, the hardfork has failed and it may become an altcoin for a while like Bcash. It will be interesting to see what the Segwit2X altcoin does in the market.

Bitcoin can only change if the overwhelming majority of users agrees to the change. By now it is clear that is not going to happen regarding the SegWit2X fork, by any metric. That is not even up for debate anymore. So calling the SegWit2X hardfork Bitcoin is wrong and fraud at this point.
Of course they are free to launch it as an altcoin, with solid replay protection, and let the market decide.

Yes, thanks for pointing that out. This could happen, before and after the hard fork. So BTC1 and Segwit2X should be considered an attack on Bitcoin.
This change does makes it less likely though, as Greg Maxwell explains, by gradually blocking non-consensus nodes like Bcash and Segwit2X from the network, instead of all at once.
Of course Segwit2X supporters are not going to like that.

Yeah I understand, but it is only cheaper in USD. You don't get more BTC for your BCH than yesterday. You'd have to way for another BCH pump, which may or may not come. Now if you had USD lying around you have a 10% discount compared to yesterday.

If Coinbase declares Segwit2X to be Bitcoin and the market decides otherwise, I have no idea what happens to your coins.

Bitcoin is not there yet to support more than a small amount of transactions per second, no surprise there.
It needs viable scaling solutions to take it to the next level, that are currently being worked out and would have been much closer to practical usage if upgrades to the protocol would not have been blocked for as long as they have been.
For now the only alternative is to pay a higher fee or use altcoins that are not in such high demand.

That is not my quote. Don't put words in my mouth. It is true though. Deflation isn't bad and inflation isn't bad per se either. Bitcoin is inflationary, every 10 minutes 12.5 BTC is being created.

Don't invest more than you are comfortable with losing. Bitcoin could go to zero, but personally I think it will go a lot higher in the coming years.

It would be healthy for Bitcoin if Bitmain moved to the other chain. Unfortunately they are still the majority hashing power on the Bitcoin chain. Even Bitmain doesn't believe in Bcash.

It's been 10% more profitable to mine Bcash before. Last time nothing happened, miners didn't even bother to switch anymore. One of two things may happen next time: 1. If it gets really profitable, like &gt;20%, the chain will be raped again until the next difficulty increase, resulting in another hyperinflation event or 2. The entity keeping the Bcash price where it currently is can slowly lower the price support, to reduce the money they are bleeding by pumping it into Bcash

And I would consider it failed too if it had to go close source. But I am not advocating for closed source. At All.
It is possible to exclude bad actors, or at least make it more difficult for them to use your code, and remain open source. Someone else explained that better than I could somewhere below. It could be done within the context of an open source license.
The thing that is unclear is how it would impact adoption and if it would turn people away.
But maybe, just maybe Bitcoin is unique in this aspect that it would need a self-defense clause in it's open source license to be able to survive ever increasing social attacks.

If you had only a few % of the BTC hash power you could now send BCH to an exchange, wait for the deposit to clear, sell it for BTC and withdraw, and then reverse the payment by producing a longer chain without the transaction (aka 51% attack).

Both forks will be split off from BTC and you will have the same addresses and amounts on the new chain as you have on the original Bitcoin chain.
For both chains it is very much unclear if they will have any value after they activate, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. We'll see when the dates get closer.

I am also talking about what happens before the hard fork.
A gradual blocking of malicious nodes is less likely to disturb the network than an instant one. The Core developers are taking a defensive approach. That is the right thing to do and the reason why the vast majority trusts them with their wealth.

It depends on whether you are talking about monetary or price inflation/deflation.

Yes, you can. Unless the price rises or drops in the meantime, obviously.
Exchanges connect buyers and sellers, so you will see an orderbook with bids on one side (people that want to buy) and asks on the other (people that want to sell). You can take an offer immediately or put one in the orderbook yourself and wait if someone takes it.

There can be no regulation if it is not enforced at gunpoint. Then it would be called an opinion. That is the point I was making.
You either let people alone and free to make their own mistakes, or you are going to have to use force to make sure they do what you define is right.

That seems to be about right. A miner needs to keep it above 0.5 blocks per hour. That is the average of the last 6 hours. Bcash had about 2% of the Bitcoin hashrate average in the last 12 hours.

A huge BTC dump? It seems to me that someone must already be losing massive amounts by keeping the BCH price where it is - that stability looks very inorganic. Dumping lots of BTC seems a certain recipe to lose even more. Yesterdays dump only made a 10% dent with &gt;20k BTC being dumped. How do you think anyone could profit from that strategy? I would love to hear what your thoughts are.

I would add that I don't think this should be absolute, because everybody makes mistakes.
For some of those people, I still think their intentions are good, but they have been misled and made a bad judgment. I would name Vinny Lingham explicitly, after seeing an interview with him, this seems to be the case. A very public statement and retracting support for SegWit2X can still go a long way to save face and regain some respect. Personally I respect people who admit their mistakes.

You are not alone. And you can blame the education system and the media for teaching that crap.

Why are they mining mostly on Bitcoin instead of Bcash, if they believe Bcash is better and will replace Bitcoin?
Kind of the same with the people on They say they don't like (I won't say hate) Bitcoin because of this and that, they fork so now they have their own coin, but 9 out of 10 posts are still about Bitcoin or the Core development team. Why? If you are really convinced that you have a better product, why keep discussing the project that you choose to leave?
I'll tell you why, because it is not about having a better product. It is about attention, egos and power.
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:23:04
Thanks for taking the time to reply. I respectfully disagree with how you describe the Core developers.
Where to start.. Like you said, AA has a LOT of videos. But the total amount of information on Bitcoin and future developments has become so mindbogglingly HUGE, that even if you were working it full-time, nobody can follow it much less understand it all anymore. I think a group like the Core dev team is the best way tackle that problem. Many volunteers, many eyeballs. It is somewhat similar to Linux. Lots of disagreements, fights and attempts to seize control, but in the end it happens to run on most servers, many gadgets you posses at home run Linux under the hood, and it gave us Android. The same will happen with Bitcoin. A group of companies and managers in suits are not going to be able to pull this project forward. They are foolish for even thinking that they can. They desperately need the best developers around the world and those have unanimously rejected them. I am not afraid that they (Barry &amp; co.) will kill Bitcoin. Many volunteers will just start anew. They will however be able to damage Bitcoin and set it back for years if they get their way.
Because you asked, I appreciate this video where AA talks about scaling and the Lightning Network, how it is going to implement a concept "streaming money", instant payment, and many things we cannot even imagine yet. I believe that will be yet another paradigm shift, like the introduction of Bitcoin was. And again most people are completely missing it, like they missed Bitcoin in 2011, and are bike-shedding about what the correct blocksize should be: 
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:24:36

@_date: 2017-09-02 11:19:02
Ironically corporations are a legal construct created by the government that shields the individuals in those corporations from personal consequences of bad behavior.
Contrary to the government, corporations don't have the option to point a gun at you if you don't want to deal with them. The state is the only entity in modern society that delivers such a valuable service, that it has to force their customers to pay for it.
So while it is correct not to trust "corporate entities" or anyone for that matter (buyer beware, do your due diligence and all that) in this case and in many other cases where people blame "big corporations", Coinbase is forced to comply with bad regulations that are enforced through the state.

That is not an issue, that's how it works in a free market when there is demand for a scarce resource (the blockchain). Don't like it?

Here's a crazy idea to make money: find a job and work. Investing is not a sustainable way to make money for most people, especially if you don't understand what you are investing in.
The efficient way to make money is to learn a skill and do actual work that people value and want to pay you for. If you are interested in cryptocurrencies, that is definitely a valuable skill to learn, but takes a lot of work to get to a level where you can provide a useful service for other people.

You lied that Bitcoin Gold is premined, so I corrected you by pointing out that a hardfork cannot be premined before its release date.


The code you linked does not confirm that Bitcoin Gold is being premined. As you said, it cannot even be mined yet and we are also before the set date for the hard fork.

That is a valid concern and Bitcoin is currently testing if the world is ready for it. However, if we lose consensus, we may lose Bitcoin, but the people who built it will not disappear and will probably go on to improve upon the lessons that were learned.

Personally I will not suffer. If disruptions happen, I will wait it out, like with the Bcrash experiment. If BTC1 nodes decide to split the Bitcoin network and fork, they will have their blockchain and I will have coins on both chains.

CoinBase said they will consider Segwit2x an upgrade to Bitcoin.
So my advice is to get your coins off of CoinBase and into your own wallet, otherwise CoinBase may convert your Bitcoin into Barrycoins (Barry 'Silly' Silbert is the fraud behind the NYA/Segwit2x clone).

Right thanks for clarifying. What is also confusing regarding the profitability is that BCH miners can still use ASICBoost, which makes it more profitable (by 10-20% I believe) so a direct comparison to BTC after SegWit is not possible. But I think your ballpark is correct.

Yeah it was hard to follow and diffused over many platforms and threads. Everyone wanted to get in. GMax offered to organize an atomic swap contract (described in detail in a thread yesterday on Reddit) so no trust was needed in a third party.

The point about the definition of a hardfork is not my opinion but the definition. If 100% (or 99% - whatever) of the ecosystem follows, the hardfork obviously is successful. If not, it fails and it is no longer Bitcoin.
In practice the economic majority will never follow 2X. If a substantial amount of your money is in Bitcoin, do you follow a group of renegades or stick with the best developers who have made Bitcoin into what it is today, while maintaining a flawless track record. Developers have unanimously rejected 2X and most would quit if the economic majority fired them. If that happens, I would consider Bitcoin dead and the experiment as failed.
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:28:02
We know that, but he keeps insisting that it is the same code. Whatever.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:19:43

No you are not alone, but people who get it are becoming a minority. That trend has been clear for a while now and it will get worse as Bitcoin goes mainstream. The system/people that made Bitcoin necessary to begin with, are going to try and get involved in redirecting its future, either because of ignorance or malfeasance.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:37:29
If reality changes, the people in charge of those companies should change their minds. But from what I read from the people pushing this hard fork, they seem oblivious to reality and they shouldn't be running such big and influential companies.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:12:48
Another important difference is that all of the top developers who are working on and have made Bitcoin into what it is today, have publicly declared that they will not work on 2X and they have explained their solid technical reasons for that.
2X is stuck with one second-rate developer for now. He has not even released the final software although he is one month before launch and Bitcoin developers have already made him aware of critical errors twice, first in his initial code change to double the size and now in the replay protection.
It is completely mad and reckless to trust a multi-billion dollar system in the hands of these people. Even if the 2X argument were a good one to begin with.

Those reorgs are going to happen no matter what.
The new release increases the chance of reorgs for some nodes now versus for all nodes simultaneously later.
It is a better strategy to slowly start severing the network from nodes that are going to be in disagreement, then to have to drop them all at once.
The latter causes much more disruption.

Correct, you are free to create another altcoin. The people who stay on the Bitcoin blockchain are and will remain in consensus.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:01:31
To answer my own question, probably not:
Example, a quick and dirty calculation, I may be wrong: If every full node (approaching 100k currently) had one 10 GHash USB miner, that would make 1 TeraHash or 0.001 PetaHash or 0.000001 ExaHash. Total hashrate of the Bitcoin network is around 10 ExaHash currently, or 10,000,000x. Those are some seriously mind-boggling numbers.

@_date: 2017-10-28 16:22:17
Interesting, thanks. It looks like I was off by a factor 1000.
So if every full node would also mine with a small 10 GHash USB miner, that would amount to 1/10,000th of the current hashing power. In other words, it wouldn't make a dent.

Age of the computer is irrelevant for now. Most hardware can still keep up with the growing blockchain. For most people the bottle neck is bandwidth.

The confusion seems to always come down to market vs. users vs. miners, and the relationships between them. Sure, ideally it would all even out, so we can both be right.
We are making a circular argument though.
I don't care so much about how Xapo in particular is going to interpret the signals by the market/users/miners and what the consequences for their business may be. More so I care about them being an instigator of this mess in the first place. They and some other businesses deciding to try and hijack the Bitcoin project from the developers and the community is what bothers a lot of users, and rightly so.
That the market will correct it in the end is probable. And if it doesn't, a big chunk of the community will consider Bitcoin failed and go on to try a new approach. It's still an experiment after all and we are learning what works and what doesn't.

There is no hierarchy, except maybe in a way that the opinions of people who have shown that they are capable are respected more. You discuss your proposed change with other people, on forums, mailing lists, chats, write a technical proposal, discuss it further for weeks but probably months and convince other people that it is a good idea. If a majority thinks it is, it will be picked up. If not, Bitcoin stays as it is (and that is by design). Changing the protocol will obviously get more and more difficult as time progresses (you won't be able to change IPv4 even if you tried) and improvements will increasingly be made on the next software layers (like Lightning Network does).

For sure people don't know what they are talking about, but if we can't even define terms there is hardly any use in arguing.
If you redefine hard fork as a complete rewrite of the blockchain, that has nothing to do with Bitcoin anymore and you are the one who has no idea what you are talking about.

@_date: 2017-09-16 17:52:52
Yes. Any. The following graph shows you exactly how many days it takes for 5, 10, 25 or 100% of the current hash power on the BTC chain to rewrite the entire Bcash chain since it forked from Bitcoin. 
And while the hash rate on the BCH chain is stagnant at best and hash power on the Bitcoin chain is increasing, this will likely become more than a theoretical threat in no time. Get your popcorn ready.

Taking Vinny as an example: Eventually he kind of gave in and confessed that he is not very technical. I say he is just a salesman who can convince other non-technical people. Nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't try to change a complex technical system, while ignoring all expert opinions. He is out of his league on this one. Not recognizing that is stupidity.
In my estimation that argument goes for many of the SegWit2X supporters.

Satoshi is building a super-computer that can store 10^65 -bit numbers! That is numbers represented by 10^65 bits, which is more bits than the total amount of atoms present on earth! AND do calculations on them!!
Patented for use by Bitcoin Cash. Because he forgot to patent the white paper.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:08:13
Sure different opinion is definitely possible. But SegWit2X goes a lot further than a divergent opinion about the future of Bitcoin.
The people who signed the agreement are actively pushing an irresponsible software client, that attacks the current network (spoofing its identity, no replay protection) and thereby disrupting both chains and its users. Some threaten to call the new chain Bitcoin and mislead users. This has the potential to turn into a shitshow like we haven't seen yet. They are playing irresponsible games with other peoples money.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:17:19
Who would have thought? /s
25% is still way too high, due to the exchange risk you are taking if you sell your split B2X on Bitfinex (you have to leave your post-fork BTC on the exchange for now). Otherwise it would be below 10%
Every poll in the last couple of weeks has shown that B2X has no user support to speak of, let alone developer support.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:41:59
I wouldn't call the people who forked Bcash devs, and 2X only has 1 part-time dev afaik.
The only thing I credit them for is providing new attack vectors, which Bitcoin has to immunize itself from.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:38:33
I'm not hating, I sincerely welcome them back from the dark side. Part of their core business should be to stay in touch with customers, like surBTC demonstrated here. Not publicly reneging from a failed agreement that is causing such damage and is unnecessarily holding up the entire ecosystem is not good enough.
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:39:26
And hopefully their businesses.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:11:24
If you could trade 2X coins for BTC right now without the exchange risk it would be below 10%


That's because these people are full of shit. Remember who they are and avoid, because doing business is built on trust.

@_date: 2017-09-11 16:22:25
I think the crux is that appealing to sensibilities between developers is becoming impossible now that Bitcoin is important enough to attract every kind of charlatan and other vermin you can think of.
That is a tough problem to solve, if possible at all. People are trying to figure out what is happening and the emotional discussions and fights are the free market figuring out how to deal with an increasingly dangerous attack vector.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:57:39
Me neither, I yell "Watch out for the landmine!"
Like almost everyone involved in Bitcoin is yelling "Bcash and 2X are shit!"
If people STILL want to buy it, there is not really much I can do.
What alternative do you propose? To not sell your 2X altcoin? That means you are sacrificing your own wealth for someone else who could and should know better. I am not willing to go down with them.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:32:42
It starts to make sense if you follow the money. Jeff is being paid by companies who depend on people transacting. Increasing the blocksize and introducing demurrage incentivizes spending. It's a tax on hodlers, like increasing the inflation rate would be (but increasing the 21 million coin limit would be a little too obvious).
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:42:50
That is a really strange question. Consensus = all involved are in agreement. From what I've seen the group you're a part of, who want to do the S2X hardfork, do not even have half. That wouldn't even fly if Bitcoin were a democracy (thank god it isn't). To make matters worse, you only claim to represent a lot of users, but you don't. It's a very sneaky way to force an agreement upon others, which is quite disturbing for someone who calls himself an Ancap.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:21:52
Thanks for the explanation.


Does this (7-8 tx) also make it more effective than it would be with 1 large transaction with BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:02:20
By threatening people with fines, prison or worse, like it works now.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:59:45
Yes, but the counterparty risk is currently priced into the B2X futures. So waiting until just before the fork will most likely result in a lower price.
OTOH we may also see a pump attempt by B2X supporters as we get closer to the hard fork date.
Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:37:33
Thank you, I thought I was the only one with this concern. I am starting to see a disturbing trend with these coup attempts. And it seems that Bitcoin is not able to defend itself very effectively.

@_date: 2017-10-10 10:54:49
On a personal level I think these fork episodes have given a much better understanding of the players in this ecosystem.
Once the dust has settled, this can be very advantageous because we now know a lot better who is relevant to Bitcoins success and who isn't, or in some cases even, a liability.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:49:49
Why are you telling me?
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:20:05


They won't until they have destroyed all paper wealth people think they have. That's what this awakening is all about and why Bitcoin was created. To separate money and state.
The first block in the blockchain includes this text which tells you all about the motive of the creator(s) of Bitcoin: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
Making a decentralized government cryptocurrency is a contradiction in terms.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:50:18


That is difficult, but you'd have to be a fool not to see that SegWit2X does not have it.

Same here, a couple of 1 sat/byte transactions all included in the next block.
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:31:40
It's also a security risk, because once you have used an address for sending, the raw public key is known to the world. Before that only the hash is known, so you have an extra layer of protection.

Many users consider Roger Ver a threat to Bitcoin. Him selling his coins would eliminate another risk, increasing the demand for Bitcoin.
I can see the price going up if this happened. Same thing happened after Silk Road closed.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:04:34
Apart from that, it is also a false understanding of Bitcoin.
The length of the blockchain is irrelevant if different consensus rules are being followed. By that metric, Ethereum is the real Bitcoin. This has been discussed ad nauseam, but I guess some companies in the Bitcoin space have better things to do than follow actual discussions by the people they supposedly provide a service to.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:53:41
I see what you mean to say with your analogy, but I think nuance is important when it comes to the rules of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is consensus based and democracy is not.
Using a hyperbolic example, with communism the people are also supposedly in charge of who rules. But you wouldn't say: "The consensus and the community protect it. It's the beauty of communism."
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:04:32

He didn't close the thread and tried to have it deleted for no reason. It wasn't that it was bad for Bitcoin, but about what it made HIM look like.

Not as long as they keep competing for the same hash power as Bitcoin. Expect it to be the first big crypto you can see going to zero in real time.
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:14:55
Your feelings are irrelevant to Bitcoin. I also don't understand what you are arguing. You admit that there are at least two groups in disagreement. That means there is no consensus.
True that businesses can create a huge mess, but they cannot tell people what to do. Most people that matter for the future of Bitcoin will not support the new chain and these companies will bankrupt themselves and/or face lawsuits if they go against the community.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:52:47
Sure, you say that about any platform and poll that disagrees with your actions. Call people toxic and now they are even crucifying you. You cannot be both the instigator of a contentious hard fork that attacks the Bitcoin network and remain neutral at the same time. You deserve to be called out on your bullshit and lies. Hypocrite.

Technically Luke is right.
By definition it is only a hardfork when all users choose to follow an incompatible change (consensus).

In this context it is important to differentiate between Bitcoin (the protocol) and Bitcoin Core (the most popular client, handed down from Satoshi, that implements the protocol).
Bitcoin Core works like most other open-source projects. Everybody can contribute, but you have to be ready for intense peer review. As long as changes don't affect the protocol, nobody except the users who run the Bitcoin Core client should care about what the core development team does.
To change the Bitcoin protocol consensus rules, the process is normally to make a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) and after extensive discussion and majority consensus by the entire community (not in backroom meetings, like Segwit2X tries to pull off) your proposal may get implemented by the independent dev teams that code the Bitcoin clients, like Core.

That is very irresponsible and not how respectable people handle major bugs. He was called out for it and now everybody is upset at each other.

To your first point, those coins eventually hit the market after the FBI sold them. I think it was more than 100k BTC. This also caused a price increase, contrary to what was expected.
Your second point I can agree with. OTOH we do not know for sure how many BTC Roger Ver (still) has. It could even be the case the he already sold or wasted most of them.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:58:33
