Please explain how Bitcoin exists if you cannot transition from centralized to decentralized. Your statement is self-contradictory and logically impossible.
A question, do you have to KYC (verify your identity) at Shapeshift or other exchanges that deal entirely in cryptocurrency exchange? 
Right now "virtual currency" exchange is regulated when you exchange fiat for crypto, with a few exceptions such as NY USA. That isn't because authorities wanted it that way, it's because it was the only enforceable point from which to regulate the exchange, because these entities must use banks to handle the fiat side of their business.
If the majority of people moved to a transnational cryptocurrency with regional authorities overseeing its exchange in many different jurisdictions, and with no authorities overseeing it in some, and users still control their private keys, it will be FAR easier for normal, everyday users to migrate from a semi-centralized cryptocurrency to a version that is more decentralized. 
THAT is his point. This game-theoretically stuff is make believe theory craft. Ver is entirely right, because he's thinking about it in terms of economics and actual regulation, not as a developer.
EDIT: and no I'm not a Roger Ver fanboy either, but I am concerned because it feels like some are twisting the statement to say something it doesn't for political reasons. The fact is, in two competing realities, one where Bitcoin stays tiny with 100k users for 5 years and is tinkered with and optimized, and another reality where it grows like crazy for 5 years and comes under increasing regulatory/centralization pressure, the second path will get us to a decentralized global currency faster, even if that second Bitcoin needs to fork to upgrade properties that defend it from centralization pressures. 
The point is that user adoption will take the most time and is the biggest challenge, not tinkering with the technology. We should see what the pressures will be at much larger scale and respond to them at that time, not theorize about what they could be and develop around hypotheticals. This is really basic stuff, folks. It's called "premature optimization" by Donald K.

I don't care if he owns a 10 BTC stake in some rinky dink online bitcoin casino but holds 10,000 in BTC.

Neither proposal is a breakthrough or implementable enough to justify distracting development effort away from achievable scaling goals.
The economics of lightning are crystal clear. You must lock up BTC to open a hub. The more BTC you have in your control to lock up, the bigger your hub, and the more channels you can open.
Neither of these proposals move beyond previous attempts at 'web of trust'. If you keep lightning decentralized, routes will fail or become inefficient. If you let lightning become centralized, it becomes efficient, but the byproduct is turning Bitcoin into a hub and spoke model.
Bitcoin isn't efficient because of its amazing 'blockchain technology'. It's efficient because it is immune from the anachronistic inefficiencies and abuses of politicians and lawmakers and moves money as if it were information.
We already have a hub and spoke model. The hubs are called networks, exchanges, processors, and banks.
So, these are probably well intentioned but damaging academic distractions from pressing needs, namely increasing the blocksize and letting Moore's Law scale Bitcoin while we incrementally optimize the protocol along the way. 
These pie in the sky ideas should be developed as stand alone projects, or on alt-coins, not inside of Bitcoin (suspiciously backed by giant incumbents).

Mining pools controlling over 10% of hash rate use it now. It's been more stable for me than core. I think the default blocksize limit of 16MB is problematic and not fully thought through, and I don't think the acceptance depth idea will work in practice, but otherwise it's at least of similar in quality to core.

It's cost effective to regulate businesses of any size that exchange fiat. It is NOT cost effective (read: possible) to effectively regulate small to medium sized businesses that exchange cryptocurrency. 
Yes, Shapeshift has a high profile. It is possible to regulate Shapeshift because the proprietor is very well known. The service that replaces Shapeshift after it is regulated won't be easy to regulate, and because there is no need for a bank account, there's really no straightforward way to enforce regulations.
e-gold and liberty reserve exchanged US dollars for centralized virtual currency. They did NOT exchange decentralized virtual currency for other decentralized virtual currency. You are confused.


Duh. If a transition was necessary, and we don't have any idea if it would be, it wouldn't happen overnight. The transition would be much more like what we are seeing with Monero and dark markets. I don't know if that trend will continue, but that's how it would happen, likely over the course of several years. Alternatively, it could also be a simple hard fork of the main cryptocurrency, with miners moving to the new fork if they operate in jurisdictions outside the control of the powers forcing centralization on the main currency. 


Adademic puffery? While you were researching papers, I was living this stuff.
I now understand your compulsion to theorize about the future instead of rolling up your sleeves and seeing what really happens. That's not a personal attack, but it is a very academic way of approaching problems. 
Unfortunately, you don't build successful decentralized cryptocurrencies with research. You build them with code, an investment ecosystem, regulatory systems, and messy internal politics.

Some of them are full blown evil shills.
What I know is that there are unconfirmed transactions. I know I believe bitcoin should be p2p e-cash. I know lightning networks does not have decentralized routing, and risks creating bank like hubs that verify the identity of users. I know if that happens, the friction from the KYC/ID system will make it expensive and just like opening a bank account. Therefore, 1.5 billion poor adults will remain unbanked and poor. Blockstream's vision is to keep bitcoin tiny, and use LN to scale. That simply does not work without creating the banking system over again. I believe we absolutely should work towards LN, but ONLY as we increase the block size at the same time. We need L1 bitcoin to compete with LN on a level playing field. Let the cheaper option win with the properties it offers. Limiting L1 to 1MB is central control. 
I believe in the saying "follow the money". Blockstream raised $76m. No company raises that much money without a product or revenue. The thing is, they have a product. We are the product...

Remember, there are already implementations of the Lightning Network live by several other companies. Not one of them has been a commercial success. All have been a unmitigated disaster and complete failure in terms of generating revenue.
Why? Because customers have to actually *want* to use products! Products need to solve a problem or fill a need. 
No one wants or needs "banks 2.0". They want decentralized p2p electronic cash that works without permission or central hubs/authorities. That's the entire point! 
Blockstream is a zombie startup. Walking dead. It's a company run by out of touch academics and bad attitude developers who lacked the ethics to turn down money from banking special interests. 
These nuts have lied to and infuriated the mining and user communities across many continents, and they have no path to revenue. None.
SWSF is failing to activate and won't because miners know better. Fool me once, so to speak. 
At this point, Blockstream couldn't generate enough revenue to fight their way out of a wet paper sack. Mark my words, they are done.

Simple, I don't like or trust the people behind it. Blockstream is not going to raise the max_block_size and wants to turn Bitcoin into a very high fee settlement network, with semi-centralized lightning networks running above it. 
I will never let that future happen. No SegWit without a hard fork and a blocksize increase, with a clear plan to scale the blocksize in the future. 
Also, no SegWit unless Greg Maxwell, Adam Back, Peter Todd, and Matt C. are kicked out of positions of power.

Can you help me understand how we can fit 600,000 transactions per day by excluding transactions with long chains when my understanding is that there is only space for a blend of multi-sig and simple transactions for about 200,000, which is about our current usage rate per day?
Are you saying we have room to grow if transactions you don't like didn't exist, when they do?

Your question entirely misses the point, possibly on purpose.
Most are opposed to the group *behind* SegWit because of their tone deaf plans for Bitcoin *after* SegWit that change Bitcoin from electronic cash to a bank settlement system.

Whether this is a "spam" attack or not is largely irrelevant.
Transaction volumes have been growing steadily for years: 
That trend is Bitcoin's growth. No one has been "spamming" for 7 years to make it look "real". Anyone suggesting that is either a lunatic or wants Bitcoin to stay small.
We are running up against capacity limits over and over. It's not a surprise, we warned everyone about it in 2015. 
The fact is, now that we are near max capacity all of the time, it is that much easier to finance a spam attack. All the more reason to increase the block size in addition to SegWit, as a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-11-01 00:22:29
FYI, the drop in hash power was from moving their mining hardware to a new location.
If we combine SegWit with gradual max_block_size scaling that matches hardware efficiencies, I bet we can do it as a hardfork safely.
Is there any chance of core meeting in the middle somewhere on this? Everyone likes the fundamentals of SegWit. The concerns are around the blocksize limit remaining untouched. It's fueling all sorts of conspiracy theories and mistrust.
The best way forward is SegWit + a scaling proposal. Do it as a hard fork. If we do that, everyone will back it. Watch.

You have no evidence this is an intentional "attack".
Assuming it is an "attack", you have zero proof whatsoever that it is politically motivated.
That said, the majority of past and current bitcoin users want to see a larger max_block_size, and a small group of well funded terrorists have blocked every attempt to grow Bitcoin.

This view is that it's worth taking risks to grow Bitcoin and make it a global currency, even if some centralization occurs, because it will be far easier to migrate from a global Bitcoin to a new version with the original properties than it would be from traditional currencies.
Stated differently, decentralized cryptocurrency will become ubiquitous, and it will happen a hell of a lot faster if we scale Bitcoin now, versus stalling and waiting indefinitely.

If your Bitcoin client isn't accepting incoming connections, you aren't contributing to the network. Don't take my word for it, [here's Satoshi saying it in 2009.](


The (flimsy) argument for not increasing the block size is that older computers can't handle the larger blocks. This will (ignoring more users = more nodes) cause fewer full nodes and increase centralization. 
Well, pruning solves this by reducing required disk capacity, thereby decreasing the pressures of centralization caused by bigger blocks. Yet pruning is not necessary or important for a full node?

How do we return the new "scaling consensus systems is impossible blockchain will fill up" Andreas for the old one in this video???
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:28:36
Not exactly.
I agree that both are decentralized routing logic, but both will also naturally favor nodes with a) more channels and b) more BTC locked up per channel. 
For example, Flare's "fog of war" will obscure the network (although this could be defeated by running multiple nodes and having them communicate their perceived network map directly), but the reactive routing logic will still favor larger nodes with more BTC locked up and more channels. That means these larger nodes will (ostensibly) generate more profit from fees, and have an incentive to grow larger. 
The missing piece is that no proposal includes economic incentives offered when running a node that will defeat this trend. The technical design of "how it works" is irrelevant if the design creates networks of bank-like hubs.
Both are great work, but aren't holistic solutions to scaling Bitcoin. My guess is that these types of approaches will become decentralized bitcoin exchanges, where it's easy to lock up BTC to sell for fiat, when a payment channel is more like an order to sell at a specific price.
I also see this as a way for two larger companies to exchange lots of transactions without writing to the blockchain.
Both of these will take demand from native Bitcoin in a manner that isn't terribly destructive, but I don't think they are end-all be all solutions to scaling. They don't solve the incentives for economies of scale with bigger nodes, naturally generating centralization.
I think Flare is much closer to being "real", for what it is worth.

This is false. Satoshi proposed a scaling approach like BIP101, where blocks double in size every two years.

Listen, been here for a while. 2010. Roger Ver has most of his $ in BTC and has for 6 years. Is he honest? Who the hell knows, but he definitely wants it to go up in price long term.
Blockstream got $76,000,000 in funding from Western Un., AXA group, and mega banks. Greg Maxwell was NOT an early developer of Bitcoin and mysteriously appeared in 2012. I saw it happen. He stole github commits from both Sirius and Gavin making it look like he was on Bitcoin much earlier than he was. 
Adam back? Nothing about him and Bitcoin until 2013. He was approached about it by Satoshi but blew him off because he didn't believe in it. These guys want to stop Bitcoin from growing. They do not hold a lot of personal $ in Bitcoin. Back and Maxwell didn't get into Bitcoin until after the price shot up in 2013 (too late) and resent it. Don't trust these two. Core is compromised and soft fork segwit is not a good thing for Bitcoin, it's a poison pill politically because if they activate soft fork Segwit, we will never, ever see a blocksize increase. They already lied about a 2MB hard fork in HK. Adam Back's academically delusional 'roadmap' for Bitcoin has no scaling in it, just optimizations and fancy abbreviations. 
We need Blockstream out of core development. Now. Don't be fooled!
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:45:06


This is an oversimplification and incorrect. For example, if blocks were 10KB, Bitcoin would be limited to a few dozen users. The price of Bitcoin would be $0 again, or close to $0. No one would invest in building exchanges or infrastructure.
There is a curve along which Bitcoin is more decentralized as there are more users and miners, but where blocksize becomes so large that it creates node centralization. This is, and always has been the reason for watching the block size.
We need a minimum system requirement for running a full node, based on a set amount of money invested, say no more than $1,500 / year. That way a hobbyist (or group of hobbyists) can still run a full node, but we can allow more users onto the system as computing efficiency grows.


Send me money right now using a sidechain without using a service promoted by a centralized company please. You cannot, because decentralized sidechains do not exist outside of blockstream marketing brochures.


At what point did I say we should run the bitcoin network for free? I understand economics, fyi. We have developers on the blockstream payroll creating supply quotas. That's not a fee market, it's price fixing (and not in Bitcoin's favor, in favor of L2 layers)!
We need to scale Bitcoin natively. We can plan on using ideas like sidechains and lightning when they are tested and solid enough for general use.

I don't agree on the Lightning Network. There's no decentralized routing logic, which means it encourages centralization and turns hubs into bigger hubs which eventually become Wells Fargo ^TM Lightning Network ^(r) Hubs powered by Blockstream ^TM, ^A ^Linux ^Foundation ^Shadow ^Company ^sponsored ^by ^MIT, ^Linkedin, ^The ^Peoples' ^Bank ^of ^China, ^AXA, ^the ^Teletubbies, ^and ^Satan
No thanks. SegWit with a blocksize increase, absolutely. I back that 100%. I'll take the blocksize increase now though.

Step 1) Aaron Van Worm misquotes ViaBTC, using "trace" instead of "immutable" or "publicly verifiable" or any other commonly used phrase that means the same thing without the negative connotation
Step 2) "Tone" (who is this asshat?) quotes Aaron Van Douche
Step 3) BillyShillson posts "Tone", and voila, FUD! ViaBTC is FinCEN!
Nice try. ViaBTC was misquoted. The point was that transactions through LN will be subject to the record keeping of the two counterparties involved in the payment channel.
That's not an advantage, Those two counterparties can hand over the transaction records to authorities without the sender and receiver knowing about it, or deny transactions entirely. With Bitcoin on chain, there is no counterparty.

Configuring pruning and many other important options are command line.
The title of this thread reads "full node". Port forwarding is necessary to contribute to the network and run a "full node". With 8 connections it's not a full node and doesn't contribute to the network.
That's not FUD. The current bitcoin client is entirely unusable for the vast majority of people because they won't be able to figure out port 8333. If they have any capacity issues, the pruning options are command line, so forget it.
Running with 8 connections it's usable but not ideal. I wouldn't recommend running a full node to a nontechnical friend because of this.

But you do so you will decide on their behalf? 
This is an inexperienced view of someone who has never built or managed something big that grows. You scale first, then you react to the challenges as they become real, making smart decisions along the way, quickly. You never stop growth to plan for growth you don't have. That's how you kill things.

BMW, the car of bankers.
Yes, a lot of miners are furious with Greg Maxwell, Adam Back, Peter Todd, and that Matt guy for lying about a 2MB hard fork.
I'm not sure why that would be surprising in any way. They, well, lied. Repeatedly. 
Now they want to turn bitcoin into a settlement network for bank hubs, while Bitcoin redlines with tens of thousands of unconfirmed transactions, and users wonder what is going on.
Are you living under a rock or something? They've pretty much done everything as wrong as humanly possible for an open source p2p electronic cash project since Gavin left.

In your own words what Satoshi described with open transactions was "basically a conceptual lightning network (minus the routing)".
In the future you envision after abandoning on-chain scaling, Bitcoin remains small and expensive, with fees far too high for normal consumer transactions. The network effectively becomes a mass settlement system for large financial institutions settling huge open payment channels. 
Lightning Networks then become our consumer transaction layer, Bitcoin remains perfect and decentralized, and insulated from the risks of centralization.
The flaw in all of this is the "minus the routing" part.
A decentralized routing scheme is required for Lightning Networks to remain decentralized. The problem is, Flare and Onion Routing do not accomplish this at all. No scheme I've seen accomplishes a decentralized L2 routing network.
Because it will always be economically advantageous to have a bigger hub with more open channels and more Bitcoin locked up, that's why. With high fees, the more Bitcoin you can lock up in a channel, the lower your cost per transaction will be.
This leads to a positive feedback loop, not dissimilar to the loop that used to drive Bitcoin's price higher before the current development team capped its growth.
Unfortunately, the new feedback loop is: 
1) Lock Bitcoin up in payment channels
2) Send transactions, charge users L2 fees
3) Make a profit
4) Goto 1, but with more Bitcoin locked up from the profit in 3 (see compounding interest tables)
The hubs that are successful will grow, and become larger and larger via the wonders of compounding interest. Alternatively, a well capitalized group (ahem, banks...) can simply open up a massively well funded hub, and provide the same transaction services to users with fees lower than everyone else, because of their scale. 
This leads to a natural progression where fewer and fewer hubs survive, mergers happen, and we end up with few or one mega hub. There is no anti-trust here, or Glass-Steagall to prevent this natural push towards monopolization from occurring! 
As sizes become really large, it will become impossible to hide the "real life" side of the operation, and hubs will fall under the scrutiny of regulators. Now we will see collusion, as these mega banks work with regulators to enact "consumer protection" and "anti-money laundering" rules with criminal penalties that are impossibly expensive for small startups to ever overcome (legally). We'll end up with some self-regulating industry association like FINRA or the NFA, or even the BIS for digital currency running the show.
Congratulations. You just reinvented the same shitty, corrupt, and incredibly dangerous banking system we have today! 
See, the flaw in your abandoning native scaling is "minus the routing". You are a smart person and have been around, I can tell. 
You MUST see that I'm right. 
Please stop supporting small blocks. It's a death sentence for Bitcoin.
We need to pursue lightning, and hopefully we figure out the routing, but if we do not, we still need a functioning Bitcoin network on L1 that we scale at a reasonable pace. This rate of scaling can be left up to the miners, or we can put ceilings in place by using the predictable caps outlined in BIP101. No Flex Caps. You can't plan a new product launch or Super Bowl add around a moving target. 
This way we can keep a fee driven but usable Bitcoin protocol that is augmented by Lightning Networks. Lightning Network transactions may be a bit more affordable, and perhaps faster, but there is still growing room on the L1 network just in case.

This infographic isn't using standard terminology. What is a "market" exactly?

That is totally insufficient. If you are not paying attention to who is investing in what companies, and who is being paid by them, you will be clueless. The source code isn't going to tell you that core has been blocking a blocksize increase for years, killing investment in the industry. It won't tell you that GreenAddress paid Peter Todd to ram RBF down our throats, or that Blockstream later bought GreenAddress, or that Theymos embezzled bitcointalk.org funds, sending them to a development shop in Hawaii to build forum software that never existed, with an executive of that development shop later being hired by blockstream, or that mining interests are aligned with blockstream, or that individuals who control the fractional reserve banking system are controlling blockstream.

Excuse me, but this is bullshit. There are all sorts of transactions, and there are legitimate use cases for transactions with long chains / many inputs.

Calling the position "blocking segwit" is self serving and inaccurate.
A large group of Bitcoin users have witnessed the current developer group ignore pleas for scaling for two years. They are afraid that segwit without a blocksize increase will entrench their position even further.
Most people I know are reasonable and want segwit and a blocksize increase (a real one, not the BS of calling SegWit what was promised). Problem is, the technical merits of segwit just don't overcome the reservations about the lies, profiteering, implicit support of censorship, and financial conflicts behind a lot of the developers pushing Segwit.
That's a more balanced look at why some are not going to signal for segwit. We don't trust Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Adam Back, or Blockstream, basically.

No, I'm writing it so you realize that people became interested in Bitcoin because it was peer to peer electronic cash with no trusted counterparties. No one is excited about Bitcoin as a very high fee settlement system limited to 1MB, with some BS "lightning network" used for everyday transactions. We're not stupid. We all know there is no routing logic that will work and preserve Bitcoin's decentralized, trustless properties, and that this is a play to turn Bitcoin into some kind of banking system, where bigger and bigger LN hubs KYC users, and follow the same 20th century regulations as the established monopolies (banks). 
If you think that miners and users are going to stand around and watch because some insidious assholes funded blockstream $76m to disarm a threat to their existing businesses, well, you've got another thing coming.
Blockstream is done, so is Segwit a a soft fork. No one trusts Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Matt C., or Adam Back. The sooner we cut out these malignant tumors, the better.

I'm admittedly a bit cantankerous today, but I'm tired of all this patent BS. Blockstream doesn't earn revenue from the things it is patenting, and even if they did, good luck getting these patents to stand up in court for side chains or lightning. The concepts were all prior art that was publicly discussed on forums and collaborated on by many. Companies that offer services that can be protected by patents do lose something to competitors if they don't patent processs. These companies (eg coinbase etc) are not coincidentally on the other side of the block size debate from Blockstream. That's what really pisses me off about this pr patent  blockstream crap. It appears philanthropic but is patently nothing but propaganda.

Blockstream doesn't make a lot of sense as a well funded startup without the explanation that the majority of their funding is being used to influence the development direction of the Bitcoin protocol to suit their business goals.

Also, you are posting the same theory repeatedly without any evidence, you said the same thing replying to another one of my posts.

This isn't an attack. 
There was ridiculous hype for Bitcoin in 2013-2015 that it would destroy banks etc. The hype was annoying. However, there was also real growth.
Look at the trend in transaction growth, it's been growing slowly and steadily for years.
We hit the limit 9 months ago or so, and we've been using slow period to "catch up" and confirm transactions. Eventually there is a point where you never "catch up". 
Raising fees with a production quota of 1MB is not healthy for Bitcoin's growth. We need to do something about this or businesses and people will switch to cryptocurrencies. 
I have no reason to make this up. I own Bitcoin, that's it!

If there are only 30 seats on the bus in a growing city, and 35 people that want to ride with more every week, there is no ticket price where everyone gets a seat. Capacity problems can't be fixed with a "fee market", they are fixed by adding buses and seats, which in this case means raising the block limit.

Transaction size is set by the user. Multi-sig and transactions with many inputs are huge. Basic transactions with few inputs are tiny. SegWit gives a moderate efficiency by removing signatures, which allows more capacity one time as everyone adopts it (which will take a long time).
If you ran a growing bus company, would you completely redesign your one bus from the ground up to hold 40 people when you have 35 customers and 30 seats, or would you spend 1/100th of that cost to buy a few more buses while you work on building a new bus from the ground up?
This analogy is perfect for the bad prioritization of putting SegWit before increasing capacity.
