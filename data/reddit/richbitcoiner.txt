OP, can you point out 1 paid shill here. Just one?
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:37:20
And yet the price does nothing. Is there anything left that can get the price back up?
Edit: why the hell am i being downvoted? What the hell is wrong with people here!
@_date: 2014-11-08 01:16:33
Can you point out one paid shill here for me?
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:59:47
You missed  Bitcoin is so tiny and after 6 years still doesn't show signs of massive user adoption that they simply don't care. It's not worth their time and energy. 
Not saying this won't change in the future but for now this is the most likely reason. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 14:44:51
Please report this guy for spam. This shit has to stop. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:57:19
Just a bunch of kids who think tipping pennies will make them rich. 
It's a stupid hype that soon will be over.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:42:59
Because it's only a massive threat in the heads of the cultists. You answered your own question. Nobody is banning it because nobody feels threatened. It's that simple. 
The same cultists who will downvote this comment to oblivion. They absolutely hate reality. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:00:25
You are 100% right. 
I am a huge Bitcoin supporter but the stuff i read here every day is just insane. These delusional cultists attract trolls making fun of them like shit attracts flies. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:36:10
And you people keep wondering why trolls come here to make fun of Bitcoiners. 
This is why. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:10:50
JYeah, the only thing that makes sense. 
My god...
How do people like you function in life?
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:45:13
Because it's fun for them to watch the cultists get all crazy. They're playing them. 
Trolls are everywhere on the internet and Bitcoiners are an easy target. Get over it. There is no conspiracy by the bankers or the government against this sub. 
Threads like this are exactly why the trolls are here. It's pure comedy. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:01:49
There would be way more arrests if this is the case. And more reports of sites taken down. 
My guess is it's all related to the few big markets taken down. 40 emails, 30 subforums, 3 chats, 5 tumblers and so on. But since they are this vague it's impossible to know at this point. I just think we would know it if 100's of sites were taken down. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:00:13
Why is this posted here?
Downvoted for asking but no explanation. Nice. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 10:11:46
Where does that 400 number come from?
Is there any evidence for this? Or is this just a case of 1 article making a mistake and the rest just copy and paste it. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:33:57
Reality slapping you in the face. Just quickly leave and it will all go away. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:37:44
Yeah, i'm paid shill. You caught me.
No seriously, it's nutters like you who attract trolls making fun of this sub. But you are too delusional to understand this. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:23:07
You are one of the cultists i'm talking about. So of course you don't think it's funny. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:14:59
What circumstances should we not forget?
Edit: downvoted for asking a question. Again. 
What is wrong with the people here?
@_date: 2014-11-10 13:37:36
Nonsense. I clearly got downvoted because i said something they didn't want to hear. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:38:11
You can't be serious. I'm not even gonna answer that. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:56:38
Can you point out one paid shill?
Edit: funny how i get downvoted yet nobody can answer me. So with this place apparently filled with paid shills you can't point out just one of them to me. Instead you just downvote me so it will go away. Sad. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:28:29
Poor guy. What a fucked up life you must have. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:36:46
After closing sr1 the darknet markets exploded thanks to the free publicity from the fbi. I'm pretty sure the effect will be the same this time. Well done FBI. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:20:58
You are 15, right?
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:08:12
How much longer is this gonna get posted?
@_date: 2014-11-08 10:26:46
The first articles said 4 and a total of 16 arrests. Sounds way more plausible. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 17:28:54
Why even bother asking. Noone knows. You'll just get 20 different guesses that mean nothing. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:07:00
Please stop this nonsense. This sub is turning into a joke. 
If it was my first day here i would think Bitcoin is a meme for 16 year olds. 
This is not what Bitcoin needs. It really isn't. No matter how "cool" you think tipping pennies is. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:52:28
Because the cultists go apeshit if someone criticizes their fantasy world. 
I never seen a group of people getting so butt hurt because of some trolls. 
The problem is that many of these cultists are young kids who hold one or two coins which they are sure will make them rich. Anyone who doesn't agree with that is a threat to them. 
Also they are so far into fantasy land that they can't imagine these trolls not being paid shills. 
It's a huge cringe fest. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:56:57
The bs he came up with. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 12:46:12
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:20:02
Report. That way the mods can ban them. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:21:11
No, i should be able to post normal things without being called all kinds of names. 
Fact is this happens all the time. Anything other than Bitcoin 10k by next month gets downvoted. If you are not sure if Bitcoin will soon go up again youbare a troll. If yiu have anything slightly negative to say you are a paid shill. They make it impossible to have a fair and balanced conversation here. And the mods allow it. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 13:11:20
Being realistic is not the same as bashing. 
When will the cultists finally understand this. 
Not everyone who is critical of certain aspects of Bitcoin is a troll. There is not one post of mine where is bash Bitcoin. 
This is getting so boring. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:18:14
It's a bunch of kids spamming everyone with pennies hoping to attract new people so their coins will become worth more. 
Yes i also hope Bitcoin becomes worth more but not by making it look like a pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:40:47
Can you point out one of them?
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:22:19
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:21:43
It's worthless and a waste of time. You can only use them to circle jerk with but please don't. It's already way too annoying. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:06:08
What do you think of the fact that i got downvoted and got called a troll and what not for making a perfectly fine comment? Do you support such behavior?
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:12:16
Can you point out just one paid shill to me?
Edit: yeah just keep downvoting all those annoying questions. Fuck facts and reality. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:07:32
Oh well, if he says it then it must be true. You convinced me. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:31:31
No, i'm talking about Bitcoin cultists. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:48:30
Get real. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:02:50
Get real. 
This sub attracts trolls because of the batshit crazy cultists that post here. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 10:37:07
I found this. 410 hidden services taken down. 
So this could be anything really. Emails, forums, anything that is hosted on Tor. 
I'm pretty sure they're making it look bigger than it is. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:17:02
How old are you?
