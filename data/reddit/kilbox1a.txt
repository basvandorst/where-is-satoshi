On the tangent of VPN's.
I have never used one as a blanket solution to privacy. If I REALLY wanted total privacy, I'd be living underground, in northern Canada, without a shred of technology. I use it because my ISP already sells customer data. (It's a stipulation in the service agreement contract.) We can't disagree, realistically, because they are literally the only provider that provides anything above dialup for 100 miles. (Charter Com). 
I don't want my ISP to sell my data. So I avert it the best way I can. 
Why does the US have to suck as far as internet privacy goes? We suck almost as badly as the UK.

The statement of paying off your kids' student debt is justifiable enough to end the post right there. Good on you.
Being a young adult with a substantial amount of student loan debt, it really hits in the feels, no matter how much gratitude your child shows on the outside, it's times two on the inside. I guarantee it. Even more if they have had the debt over their heads for awhile. You are a good parent. My pops would have sold it and pocketed it. We need more cool people like you OP.

*I'm proficient in computers, and understand the basics of segwit but don't really understand what it would take for pools to support*
What would they have to do to have the entire pool cluster support it? Would miners themselves have to do anything?
I know I'm a noob. But it would help my understanding of the Bitcoin network as a whole since the the backend of pools (aside from actual miners) is still kind of a mystery to me.

I am hodling, because: 
I think cryptocurrencies in general is an amazing idea. 
Idk really. 
I thought it was a really cool thing when I first heard about it, and still do. 
I'm a back yard investor of sorts so the keeping up with the market for the reason of me having vested in BTC is a cool thing. 
I've always loved the stock market, and Bitcoin was a way to keep me interested in investing, due to the underlying technology involved.
And being 13, with the family computer having a 5970, and running on a pool when everyone was sleeping, free money back in 2011, when having a job was impossible.

I do a bit of both. 
I barter a lot. 
I have friends that live long distances away, and cash in hand isn't feasible. So they just send me BTC. 
Like I have a few servers in a Colo (for my part time job), I have a couple friends renting them out for their own use. They pay in BTC. 
I also have a monthly buy set up on coinbase. But I'm switching to Gemini, after my last round gets put in the wallet and transferred to my hardware wallet.

I actually had a meeting with my local CU when I first started investing in Bitcoin, they had to bring in the IT guy since the manager didn't know what it was. what the manager said after he had an understanding of what it was: "it's not our money, so we don't tell you how to spend it. It's exactly like a wire transfer out, when you buy it. So we don't mind at all".
