When it takes more work to move your daily wages than to earn your daily wages.

Look up the definition. Capitalism is voluntary and all parties involved must do so in mutual benefit.
Take a look at the Merriam-Webster dictionary:
an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.
Again, cronyism and capitalism are the opposite of one another. 
I’m not wrong. Please learn things.

I’m going to have to disagree. Government isn’t just another economic actor.
It has (or at least should have) a monopoly on coercion, or the use of force.
Using that force to gain an advantage in the market is anti-free market and therefore not capitalism.

I’m not sure if “crony capitalist” is the correct description. If it invokes cronyism then it is not capitalism. 
They’re just cronies, plain and simple.

Tax rates, regulations, and corporate welfare are the opposite of capitalism.
If Buffet uses these items he is NOT a capitalist.
Many conflate pro-business and capitalism. They are very different schools of thought.

Only about 40 years. 
Still, a capitalist that is crony isn’t a capitalist.
One cannot be for voluntary exchange if they’re willing to support mandated exchanges.

I also find it entertaining that we probably agree on the evils of using government to allow a few connected individuals to have an advantage over all others and profit from it.
Yet, you’re so jaded to the word “capitalism” due to your programming you’d prefer to argue over your redefinition of this ancient concept.

Last attempt, because it just doesn’t appear you have the reason enough to understand this.
Capitalism is the use of a free market system. Lobbying government to gain an advantage is anti-free market (and in my opinion evil).
Therefore, it isn’t capitalism. 
It really is that simple to understand.

Generally the premise behind a “free market.”
If there is not coercion in the market then it is voluntary.
So yes, there are words regarding voluntary.

I’m not imagining a thing. I’m simply explaining what capitalism is.
I’m well aware capitalism does not currently exist. 
I’m also aware that as nations trend toward capitalism poverty decreases.

To my understanding, one cannot transfer BTC into or out of Robinhood. That means any trading done in Robinhood is done so by BTC provided by Robinhood alone. 
It is an exchange wholly separated from all other BTC transactions and will have little to no effect on the market except for those times RH purchases BTC to be made available in their private exchange.

I’d like to think Jefferson would have been an early crypto adopter, being opposed to the central bank and all.

Further, if one cannot transfer their BTC out of an exchange I would always be suspicious the BTC doesn't exist.

That is like asking if President George Washington knew the US Dollar would be used to facilitate the purchase of drugs in back alleys.
When trading, individuals voluntarily exchange items of value. Currency is a store of value. It is used to facilitate trade. Sometimes that trade is what the government considers to be illegal.
