Are you sure? Capital gains tax doesn't apply, but other taxes very well might depending on whether it's considered an asset or money. The whole thing is up in the air until there's clear direction from your country's tax authorities.
Just because a website says certain taxes apply doesn't make it true. Even if you hire a professional accountant, their advice is just that: Advice.

You won't make the market freer by introducing new barriers to freedom.

There are still famines because there are still countries which haven't reached the stage of industrialised market economies. It's ridiculous to blame the west for ending their own starvation but failing to do it for everyone else.

One example please. And keep in mind union oil is a counterexample.


Absolutely not, it has a huge effect. Chiefly to allow cartels to protect their position in the name of "competition."
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:22:25


Correct, which is why we should get rid of the piece of regulation available for destruction.


* They don't have a monopoly
* What was so much more horrible about the 2014 internet compared to the 2017 internet?

And you should be seriously concerned about a man with billions to spend trying to reshape your society.

What changed? The only thing that changed is Obama's 300 page regulation which virtually no one has read (including the people who voted on it) and now it's changing back.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:39:02


Sure. Getting the government out of the game would be a good start. Most blockages I can think of were government mandated.


I think he's brazilian, but it doesn't sound crazy to me.

Why is that fortunate? People can be real fucking idiots.

It's removing one rules saying ISPs can't sell fast lanes. The only ones whining about it being removed are the companies who built their own fast lanes and their useful idiots.

There is such a thing as a market socialist, and some of them are communist, it's just that they're rare as hens teeth.

This from the guy who thinks the government is going to protect him from monopolists.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:35:10


Except that it is. He literally gave examples of how NN works in practice. Even if NN were about protecting small businesses in theory, it's not going to work out that way in reality.


It restricts innovation by giving the government control over what commercial arrangements are permissable or not.

For example: Net neutrality


That's like saying you're not willing to put out the fire in the kitchen until the fires in all the other rooms are put out.

More accurately, a law requiring all forms of transport entering times square to be vetted in case someone rides a Zebra.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:14:57


Well... yes, they're the ones selling it. Are you against bakers deciding who gets bread and who doesn't, or uber drivers deciding who gets transport and who doesn't?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:17:18


No, but if it were easy to sidestep such power structures (eg. underpaying taxes) I suspect most people would where it benefitted them.


In the case of net neutrality, the bandaid is scrunched up inside the leaky pipe causing a blockage.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:49:02


In the long term? Censorship resistant meshnet projects. Tor is a good start for now.
In the short term? Supporting deregulaton efforts like axing net neutrality.
I will say this though, I'm seriously impressed by the propaganda campaign Open Societies Foundation and Big Data pulled off on that one. They really suckered all the millenials in.


To a much lesser degree


See above


Which means less FCC power. The other option is FCC plus NN which means the FCC controls the internet almost entirely.


I would say that the pro-NN position is completely blind. Seriously, most of you have no idea what net neutrality is, or what the causes of the problem are.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:42:08


Only in the sense that Net Neutrality rules would probably make meshnets illegal, since each node operator couldn't hope to fulfill the reporting requirements of a public utility. So getting rid of them makes it just as possible to build a meshnet as it was before.
It's not even new tech, they've been running WUGs in South Africa since the 90s and Romania's internet was built by volunteers building LANs. The tricky part is decentralising it, ensuring strong encryption and monetising it.
Oh, and as far as I know, none of the major meshnet projects are even considering instituting net neutrality.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:51
You don't need to built national infrastructure to make a new level 3. And the Romanians built their network up from local village LANs, so I'm pretty sure you're wrong.


You have this exactly backwards.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:30:20


They certainly are if consumers can be so easily brainwashed into accepting regulatory capture.


From what? Forcing Netflix to actually help pay for their massive overconsumption?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:26:31
So unregulated and free we need 300 pages of regulations (voted on with 48 hours notice).
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:47:39


Correct, they're in control of something much more important: Food. And yet for some reason we don't need bread neutrality, if a baker is being a dick we just go to another baker.


I agree, and increasing government control of the internet certainly doesn't achieve that end.


I'm ok with that because I know the days are numbered of any service provider that tries that shit. I'd be much more concerned if the government had the power to step in and prevent competition from replacing them.


I agree. And by far the largest corporation trying to control cyberspace is the US federal government.

I think you're grossly underestimating the amount of computers in third world countries. Even if they've never owned a desktop, they sure as shit have a smartphone.

Welding torches are also pretty easy to come by in India...
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:31:15


I'm against the concept of net neutrality, but those are also good arguments.

I'm guessing he asked them to download some smartphone wallet.
@_date: 2017-04-17 22:19:54
Honestly, I wouldn't expect it to do away with income tax: Most earners have their tax payed on their behalf by their employer. It's much more likely to erode other forms of tax like capital gains and sales tax.
