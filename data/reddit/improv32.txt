Almost everything in the block is hashed. The payout is called a coinbase transaction, and appears as just another transaction in the list, so it is hashed. If it was not hashed, then how would the network know who the mining reward belongs to?

This. It's more economical, and works independent of the Bitcoin network.

It's funny, because there's no evidence that Mt. Gox was ever an an actual, functional MTG exchange.

Look at the date axis, it reads: 4/1/2013 7/1/2013 10/1/2013. That means, depending on the date format, this data occurred over the past seven months, or this took place over seven days in *January*.

That's a perfectly reasonable prediction to have made, given the circumstances. The run-up to the current $1000+ price was sudden, unexpected, and unclear if it will hold.

If they were going to do that why wouldn't they make merchants record banknote serial numbers right now?

This is friendly, but it doesn't explain how mining verifies transactions, nor why it is necessary for mining to occur.

Users need the block chain to calculate transactions

That's when you hand someone money physically, the distributed exchange is in-person transactions because fiat only works in physical form. All online fiat exchange is done on faith of the intermediary.

To add on to the escrow bit: multisig addresses allow for safe and secure arbitration by a mutually trusted third-party, who by nature of the system cannot take your money, only decide to finalize the transaction and give it to the recipient, or return it to the sender. This will allow for an open market of arbitrators based on a public reputation system. An early version of what this will look like is already here: 
The problem of chargebacks/fraud-protection is often glossed over by bitcoin proponents, but this is a very real need to prevent rampant scamming. The way bitcoin deals with this is actually an *improvement* over the current system, I wish it was highlighted more.

I think what other people were concerned about is the malicious nodes providing fake Blockchain data, tricking the lite client into signing a transaction which was not intended, but I'm not sure how feasible that would be.
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:10:50
I always hear this response to that challenge, and it's not a good one. A medium of exchange is still needed just cause the power went out. Power outages are fairly common actually.

With hardware wallets, the transaction is generated on some other, less secure device, which sends it to the hardware wallet to sign. That way the less secure device can send bitcoin without ever knowing the private key, keeping it safe inside the hardware wallet. Generally, a hardware wallet will present some sort of confirmation on the device itself to the user, that it was the user intended to be signed.

Miners determine for themselves which transactions to include in their blocks. Higher transaction fees provide an incentive for miners to include your transactions in their blocks, since they receive those + the coinbase (currently 25 BTC). If you don't include a TX fee it may still get included anyway, it's really a shot in the dark.
@_date: 2013-05-10 04:18:35
I believe that only applies to miners.

Not entirely true, the "bitcoin hash" is just double sha256. I believe that the default auth system for Django apps uses 10000 pbkdf2_sha256 iterations, so they would be quite fast at cracking those.

You could always just include a TX fee lower than that, electrum suggests .00002 as a sufficient TX fee, which is still less than 1 cent at current market price. It's not free, but it's *far* better than what PayPal would charge.
