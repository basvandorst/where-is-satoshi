Bitcoin doesn't work on annual cycles. Better to look at 2 years prior the 2016 halving and one year and a half post the halving. That would be good logic.

I've been in crypto since mid 2017. This is to be expected - Embrace the bear as you would embrace the bull, because long term the sun will shine.
For those who sold with a view to back cheaper - well played.

Im with you...At some point this month or next month, halving fever will rise....so too will the btc price.
Always an easy hodl.
Ive seen severe dips and severe pumps.

Bitcoin Mempool.
what's happening ?
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:58:00
perhaps best to just buy Bitcoin. let a few years elapse then trade it. history has proven this to be very successful. there is a btc halving event in may 2020, best research this as well as other fundamentals which have proven to steer the value of drastically.

If there is a time that I believe people will begin to trickle into Bitcoin it is between mid November to March. I expect that to be a big period of growth. Why - severe halving growth.

with a view to buy a correction I did it once during 2017...the fomo'in back in was a relief. but overall not a nice feeling.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:33:13
the fact that month by month we are edging closer - tenuous but relevant.

Around June, let me remind you of the comment I spouted frequently:
I would rather BTC bart for a few months than continue to rage past $14k because it is beginning to look like a  mania bubble. 
It since barted between $9k and $11 for the past 2 months. Because I think long term I am happy to see what I wished for. This past 2 months has left BTC on a perfect platform to at least look like organic price growth. 
BAKKT and ETF have come at the right time.
@_date: 2019-08-22 08:21:57
The Market may seem boring...I.e. bitcoin barting and alts slowly draining BUT it has to be this way. One thing is for sure, this market doesn’t stay steady for long. 
I think the crypto market is just refuelling for some big price action in the next few months. Of course BTC is going rally !
@_date: 2019-08-29 06:49:31
bitMEX is great at what it does. It will be far better once some legitimate competition comes along (binance leverage, bakkt etc).
@_date: 2019-08-19 12:00:04
I would guess September is going to be a big BTC growth month.
1. U.S. Binance traders will move into BTC.
2. Halving
3. Bakkt launch and marketing on the 23rd of September.
4. Continued global economic woes.
Love thy Bitcoin

Wow it's been a super year so far.
Long term trajectory looks on mark.

"The BoE (Bank of England) will possibly raise interest rates."
Dude, the global debt based system is broken and the only for for it to stay above water is if the masses are spending. Raising interest rates discourages spending. I'm confident interests rates will not be raised by the BoE.
Bottom line - recessions even depressions clean all the dead value out of the global monetary system - let it happen. I appreciate it is a contrarian view but it is very much a cruel to be kind situation.
I really think BITCOIN could be a silver bullet if these times prove to be testing.

**Bravo! well said
Despite much needed short term volatility (it can always go up!), Bitcoins long term fundamentals are iron clad!**

Tries way too hard. Given what he/they created and how he/they created it (bitcoin), as if you would announce yourself to the world in such manner.
The dickhead behind this went too hard on the 'hal was my friend' and 'look I know cryptogrpahy'.
The best indication of who Satoshi is would be the ability to move the funds connected to his/their alleged wallet.
DO NOT BE FOOLED.
@_date: 2019-08-29 09:16:19
Yes and there is a well-known post going around where some random person has correctly guessed the price regions of bitcoin.
Because of bakkt, halving, libra and global economic crisis bitcoin will grow to new highs in the next 3 months.
Lets not forget the 12th of Sept as many a shitcoin may be sold for btc from u.s. customers.
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:51:36
weekly trend still shows higher lows. i think september will see $12k as bitcoins new support.
white hot bullish.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:02:42
LOL. As if.
It read like some board opportunist trying way too hard to seek out someone who could help them hack Satoshi real wallet.
It was cringworthy

can Bitcoin pump to $16k on Halloween therefore keeping the prophecy alive...odds are against it...but don't rule it out in this crazy market

Both a necessary evil....for the time being.
@_date: 2019-09-09 06:03:05
You know it is. 23rd bakkt, may 2020 halving coupled with the fact BTC is a deflationary asset in a world of inflation that is on the brink recession.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:37:09
not yet .... wait until mid sept to end of oct
@_date: 2019-09-13 12:09:17
This week the ECB said they are going to print €20 billion each month beginning in November (qe / inflate). Next week the FED and the PBoC release details of their monetary strategies. The following week BAKKT will launch - oh my, what a coincidence.
Always follow the money trail and stay hot on the heels of central banks, they hold the power.
@_date: 2019-09-17 06:46:39
Okay. I’m all BTC. I respect the coin that rules them all. But there is no denying alts have had a great week. 
IMO, this is due to everyone selling the Bakkt prelaunch and reverting back to their original positions. This could be a massive fake out, because if Bakkt has strong sales then alt money will flood back into BTC.
Alternately Bakkt might be hype ?
All I know is the miners have drastically increased the BTC network hash power and they are expecting an increased jolt in every measure - price, usage, etc.
I’m open minded but my position is with BTC...something is brewing, the alt flurry is a fake out.
