Are you sure?

There you go. Stripped from all references and comparisons to cryptocurrencies.

You could add it as an annotation (they might have removed those) or just leave it in the description and change it once in a while. How convenient is copying a bitcoin address from a video anyways? You can't copy paste. You COULD make it a QR code though.
What I would do personally is mention it's in the description and change it every now and then. Or just not change it... just don't use that same address elsewhere.

I'm more concerned about the "Leaking Paws" news story below it

Think credit cards. A lot of people don't know how they work, they just know what they can use it for and how to use it. They only know what they NEED to know.
Bitcoin is not simple right now. It is in early development and adoption, just like the internet was in its early days. It's complexity is keeping it's usage down and people stick with what they are used to and can be used everywhere. People who are into bitcoin right now are enthusiasts. They learn the ins and outs of how it works that people will not even remotely need to understand when it comes to mass adoption and usage. Unlike the era when the internet was coming to fruition, media covered bitcoin quite grandly while it is still in it's infancy state and already available globally. This created a period of time where price speculation and investment opportunity skyrocketed bitcoin to popularity.
It is still not easy or mainstream to use them for purchases. The value of bitcoin is in its futureproof use. IF it becomes more used, there are less bitcoin available. Demand goes up, price goes up. When its adoption is more stable and most people have money not only in local currency but also bitcoin, then the price value of bitcoin in comparison to local currency will definitely be higher. There aren't even enough potential bitcoins for everyone to have 1 bitcoin. We have to use fractions of them (which they are designed for). If it becomes massively adopted, we will be dealing with satoshis. Anyone who kept something like 1 bitcoin, will be rich.
Note that I say IF and not WHEN because anything can happen. But IF bitcoin is used massively as an alternative because of its advantages over local currencies, the value of 1 bitcoin HAS to go up. Just because bitcoin thrives it does not mean local currencies die. I, in fact, believe they should both exist alongside each other.

What? Bitcoin is decentralized. There is no owner.

If you're talking about CPU power, Moore's law was mostly at a halt from Intel not having competition. AMD has kicked Moore's law back into gear these past couple of years.

That analogy only works if you are dropping in a glass of salted water

It's backed by what people say it's worth. It has purchasing power and as long as people accept it, people will use it as a currency. It's kind of circulatory but it used to be back by gold; now it is debt and central banks regulating the printing of money.
Consumer spending, supply and demand for goods will affect the worth of currency. If people have less of it or a harder time obtaining it, businesses need to lower their prices to accommodate so people can purchase their goods/services, thus increasing the value of the currency.

That's the thing. It does require government approval because it would be fraud. But you are still trusting a higher party to NOT do that. It is done though, as another user pointed out, to adjust for inflation and other factors

I'm not interested in economics enough to read up on it, sorry. I was mostly in this discussion for the reasoning why "people are dumb and don't believe in bitcoin" when it's not as simple as that. I didn't mean to get into the details of our monetary system, but more the psychology in people who trust it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:06:31
Ah yes. This is what destroyed the Zimbabwean dollar if I'm not mistaken? It was overdone. I believe the US runs in debt and just prints money to temporarily "solve" the problem whilst worsening the issue for the future.
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:51:43
Yes except it can't be maintained by printing more money. It has to be mined, which follows a curve similar to gold. There is a limit.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:35:57
A big reason for that is because of how abstracted they are from the way money actually works in their daily lives. Printed money or minted coins with ASSIGNED value. There is no actual goods backing the value like there used to be (gold). Third parties controlling their money. Credit cards make them feel safe because a third party provides certain protections up to certain values if anything goes wrong. This is what they are used to and what makes sense to them because it's the way it has been for a long time. Change is scary and they don't actually see what's wrong with current systems.
The current monetary system is almost a virtual currency at this point because money is moved with numbers from database to database. Someone in banking could just create money out of thin air. The only reason it doesn't happen is because banking is a business and it would be fraud. The books need to balance. We are trusting specific people and organizations to not completely devalue money and cheat the system.
Bitcoin is balanced by the system. It doesn't need to be audited and checked for fraud. No one can just say they have x more bitcoins than they have because all the books are completely public and backed by cryptography making transactions unalterable.
I think things will chain once cryptocurrency and the blockchain have enough abstraction layers to make it as easy as credit cards and a way to safely store their bitcoins like they do with money. I think people feel safer making someone else responsible for their money than themselves. Bitcoin right now isn't mainstream enough to have a form of "bank chains" where people can store their bitcoin and feel safe about it. It's not for everyone yet and there isn't a REASON for first-world nations to stop using their current trusted form of currency.
I'm going to stop here before I write a poorly-written endless essay, but I think I got my point across. In short, I agree with you, but I think it's important to understand why most people don't quite want to jump in at this point.

Hm yeah, I can see why bitcoin as a currency is not viable. I guess I was thinking if the possibility of a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin becoming a mainstream international currency became true in 50 years or so, the value of bitcoin would magically be more stable. I can see why that isn't the case now.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:03:03
Exactly! Countries that are struggling with their currency see bitcoin as a safer option for storing monetary value. There is incentive there to adapt to bitcoin more quickly.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:39:22
Ah ok. I just felt like bitcoin's fluctuations are managed by the market/mining which are more natural and decentralized rather than giving the power to a third-party who can sharply affect the value themselves.
With bitcoin, as the supply decreases, the value will naturally increase per bitcoin, but we will just use fractions of a bitcoin. All the other factors will affect bitcoin the same way it affects money without the possibility of increased supply on demand by people in power.
I don't believe that bitcoin is a stable currency right now. Merchants who accept it are pricing them based on their local currency value and trading them on-the-fly to avoid getting caught on a downswing. The Bitcoin network is what I think is safe and the whole point of the initial discussion was about people feeling safe using a digital currency on the decentralized network aspect and the method of storage.

I wasn't talking about the teller. It goes higher than that :P
