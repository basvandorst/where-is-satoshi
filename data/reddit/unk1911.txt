Did anyone call the number listed on this letter and speak with an agent? I got the 6174-A letter today. I would like to get some more specifics from them about what is out of line, as I used the bitcoin.tax website to help prepare my taxes, not aware of any ommissions.  Hoping they call me back with more details.  There are no details in the letter itself, which made me question the validity of it at first, but it does have the last 4 digits of my tax id, so I guess it is "legit".

well the good news is,  after about 3 weeks,  my transaction fell off the mempool. at that point, i was able to right click and 'abandon',   that resolved the issue for me.   next time i will be very careful when setting the fee...

there is an episode on the showtime series DARK NET, called MY MONEY  (S2 E3 [ , in which a web cam model tells her story.  she started camming to help pay through college. paypal closed her account because they disagreed with her "business model". soon after, she discovered bitcoin and continued running her cam business, made enough money to pay for college, and then some.  it's a success story....   what does it have to do with this thread? alex jones is a menace to society. we disagree with his action.   however, i don't think it is fair for me (or for paypal) to stop the bastard from transacting, in essence stripping him of certain liberties/rights.  this is precisely what makes bitcoin great. as long as bitcoin exists, the paypals of the world will not be able to stop anyone, whether it's a a webcam girl trying to make a few bucks or a right-wing conspiracy theory nutcase, from exercising his/her basic human liberties.

friend, know this: i'm on your side.  i also love bitcoin. a lot.  but, the chart you show displays averages, which smooths out the highs and the lows.  i speak from experience, because i was there, transacting, and i definitively remember having to pay the equivalent of $100 for one of my bitcoin transactions to go through.   it was a very exciting time to be following bitcoin but not so exciting a time for doing boring business-as-usual transacting.  it is because of this very reason, and they have cited it in their press releases, that groups such as Steam, and some others, stopped accepting bitcoin payments.  high transaction fees was a practical concern for groups trying to do business online using bitcoin.
as for what caused the high fees, whether it was the surge of enthusiasm for bitcoin or perhaps bad actors on the BCH camp or the Segwit2X camp,   isn't that part of the story irrelevant?  in fact i think it slightly weakens the argument.   until there is wide adoption, i don't think it's fair to compare the two methods on the merit of their relative transaction costs.
@_date: 2018-08-31 01:18:49
with all due respect,  as recently as last november/december, before there was talk of the lightning network, while enthusiasm for bitcoin was skyrocketing, the btc mempool was very clogged up. the tx fee rose to \~ $100.   it became impossible to practically use btc for small purchases... also some wallets that didn't properly adjust to the new fees would assign too small a fee and some peoples' tx's would get stuck in the mempool for weeks if not months.   fee accelerator services became popular briefly, they would charge a bit extra $ to get those stuck transactions moving again...

@_date: 2014-09-28 16:36:25
i had the same question/issue--  bitcoin is accepted when the item you are buying is sold by newegg.  for example, the following item is sold by newegg and you can use bitcoins to purchase it:
however the following item is not sold directly by newegg so you cannot use bitcoins for it:
so in summary:
  if you see the text: "Sold and Shipped by: $vendorName"  you cannot use bitcoins.  
  if you see text "Sold and Shipped by: Newegg",  then you CAN use bitcoins.

ok i think that makes sense.  in my mind, the spread is akin to a credit default swap-- it's like when bear stearns was crashing in 2008, the CDS spiked up.   it's essentially counter-party-risk premium that traders/investors are willing to pay in the event the company goes under,  and right now with withdrawals frozen, there is a big question-mark hanging over gox's solvency.    with that said, i agree with you that they will most likely recover from this int he end.   it happened so many times historically for them...

i wanted to run a full node on my one of my light virtual servers but realized the blockchain now needs about 37GB of space.  my virtual server only has 40GB of space in total unfortunately so i decided not to run it.   could the growing size of the blockchain be the reason why there are few full nodes? 
also as a parallel thought:   if the blockchain "compresses" well maybe i can create a separate compressed partition and store it on that partition or something...

in my case [i live in the u.s.], i read that it may be possible to write off these types of losses as a "capital loss" and at least get some marginal tax benefit from it [i.e., offset my income/earnings against the losses for a smaller tax bill], although i have to look into this further.
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:47:26
i think the difficulty here though you have to be able to clearly/prove that this was a theft / that there was criminality.   if they say there  is a "technical glitch" that is holding things up it may be more difficult to make a claim that it's a loss... does that make sense?

i'm sorry sir but you are in the wrong.  in the eyes of the i.r.s.,  what you do with those coins is immaterial but once those coins leave coinbase: (i.e., event=withdrawal),  it becomes a taxable event.  end of story.
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:30:29
i naively thought the same, and then i read the most recent i.r.s. subpoena.  in there, they are paying attention to any transaction that went from coinbase's addresses out to extnal address.  in the eyes of the i.r.s., those tx's re taxable events.  
i'm not saying i agree with this in any way, i'm just telling you what i read in the paper.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:12:47
good advice, except that in the u.s., when you transfer your bitcoin out,   in the eyes of the i.r.s., this becomes a taxlot / tradeable event.   you are now accountable for properly reporting any short term / long term gains/losses on your tax returns.   how annoying is that, right?   that is one argument for keeping the coins on coinbase: just so much less hassle.  and coinbase offers coldstorage solutions.

in nyc i was able to successfully order food (for both pickup and delivery) via foodler.com.  the way foodler works is you load up your account with bitcoins and the $ is stored as usdin your account and then you order food with usd.   not as many restaurants are available via foodler as via seamless.com but still there's enough of them near home and work to make it worthwhile.  i would recommend it.   also one nice thing they do is they use mt. gox exchange rates for converting your btc to usd,  and as many of you know, rates on mtgox are typically around 8% higher than the other exchanges, so it works out pretty nicely...  also foodler itself will often offer 15-20% discounts when you order for the first time from a restaurant [just like seamless]...
actually while writing this, i just had an idea:   there's an "arbitrage" opportunity here.   (i.e., buy btc with coinbase at a discount [relative to gox],  and then buy food on foodler with mtgox rates, at an 8% discount! :) )

don't get me wrong i love bitcoin-- we are on the same side-- i just think the meteoric rise in price signals trouble ahead and could indicate a speculative bubble.  sadly, it's the guys who get all excited and start buying at high prices, who get burned when the speculative bubble finally bursts.  i do hope i'm wrong-- and as i said, i'm keeping a quantity that i do not intend to sell-- in case it does keep rising.

no i don't think you understand the initial setup:   i did not spend the coins between 7 days and today. if anything, i added coins to the main wallet.    however, the backup version of this wallet does not reflect these things... if anything, the backup wallet is showing a quantity that is LESS THAN the quantity i started with in the main wallet 7 days ago. this is somewhat disconcerting...

a couple of thoughts regarding the recent rise.   for one, it seems to be correlated with the run up in the u.s. equities market.   we had 34 sessions where the dow had no correction below 1%. finally this week we got 2 down days, but outside of that, it's been "smooth sailing" or rather "smooth drifting" upwards.  the bitcoin is also doing the same.  if i was a serious investor i would be scared shitless. (both on the DOW and on the long BTC side).   btw, does anyone know if it's possible to SHORT bitcoin, given that bitcoinica is out of commission?  without an effective way to short btc,  the price can experience an extremely painful correction that can send the whole thing crashing down in a few minutes.   lastly,   and this is just a personal observation from years of investment experience... but this thing looks a lot like a classic pump and dump. does no one else see it like that?  so i am personally being very careful with this. i was lucky to have acquired a small quantity of bitcoins when they were cheap, about a year ago,  at around $4.  with the recent run up the price, i have been steadily selling them off daily, in small doses.     i do plan to never sell a certain amount-- but outside of that, i don't think this sort of movement is sustainable over the long run.  there will be a very painful correction,  and it may hurt some folks who got caught up in the excitement...

although the only true test would be to keep the backup wallet as wallet.dat, then erase the locally stored 10GB blockchain, and then have the client re-download the blockchain and essentially recreate all the transactions as they occurred historically overly the last year or so... and perhaps then the balance will show the correct amount...?  the only issue with this is since the blockchain is so damn long/huge, it can take almost a day to complete this operation...

i agree with you. although the initial crash was potentially fueled by mtgox's trade matching engine being unable to handle the large volume,   they probably felt really bad about getting rich from the chaos that ensued from the issue they were responsible for so they decided to remove the fees,  but that only gives people more incentive to trade a lot MORE frequently,  causing the engine to lag even more... there has to be a better way...

imahotdoglol:   i have completed the empirical test.  the results do not agree with your writeup.  (i.e.,  the backed up copy of the wallet contained the correct balance even though i had executed a transactions after i backed up the wallet).   how do you explain that....? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:31:49
i just read this:   the thing is that this doesn't explain it either, because i've only had 20 transactions since i backed up the wallet... the wiki page says if you do 100 things after you backed up your wallet, you will lose bitcoins:
Securing the Bitcoin-QT or bitcoind wallet
Bitcoin transactions send Bitcoins to a specific public key. A Bitcoin address is an encoded hash of a public key. In order to use received Bitcoins, you need to have the private key matching the public key you received with. This is sort of like a super long password associated with an account (the account is the public key). Your Bitcoin wallet contains all of the private keys necessary for spending your received transactions. If you delete your wallet without a backup, then you no longer have the authorization information necessary to claim your coins, and the coins associated with those keys are lost forever.
The wallet contains a pool of queued keys. By default there are 100 keys in the key pool. The size of the pool is configurable using the "-keypool" command line argument. When you need an address for whatever reason (send, “new address”, generation, etc.), the key is not actually generated freshly, but taken from this pool. A brand new address is generated to fill the pool back to 100. So when a backup is first created, it has all of your old keys plus 100 unused keys. After sending a transaction, it has 99 unused keys. After a total of 100 new-key actions, you will start using keys that are not in your backup. Since the backup does not have the private keys necessary for authorizing spends of these coins, restoring from the old backup will cause you to lose Bitcoins.
Creating a new address generates a new pair of public and private keys, which are added to your wallet. Each keypair is mostly random numbers, so they cannot be known prior to generation. If you backup your wallet and then create more than 100 new addresses, the keypair associated with the newest addresses will not be in the old wallet because the new keypairs are only known after creating them. Any coins received at these addresses will be lost if you restore from the backup.
The situation is made somewhat more confusing because the receiving addresses shown in the UI are not the only keys in your wallet. Each Bitcoin generation is given a new public key, and, more importantly, each sent transaction also sends some number of Bitcoins back to yourself at a new key. When sending Bitcoins to anyone, you generate a new keypair for yourself and simultaneously send Bitcoins to your new public key and the actual recipient's public key. This is an anonymity feature – it makes tracking Bitcoin transactions much more difficult.
So if you create a backup, do more than 100 things that cause a new key to be used, and then restore from the backup, some Bitcoins will be lost. Bitcoin has not deleted any keys (keys are never deleted) – it has created a new key that is not in your old backup and then sent Bitcoins to it.

but i think this is simply not true.  so if i start with 1.00 btc, i copy my wallet.dat,  i then send someone 0.50 btc and then have someone send me 0.25 btc,  then my main wallet will show 0.75 btc.   if i then transfer the copied wallet to another computer and start up the wallet thick-client,  the balance should also show 0.75 btc.   you disagree with this premise?

i am going to try this out right now,  just for my own sanity...

the trade book doesn't have much depth to it,  it makes it possible for a couple of relatively insignificant entities to move the price of the entire market wildly either up or down.   hopefully some day the bitcoin market/economy will grow to the point where this type of manipulation will no longer be possible... thus giving some stability to the virtual currency... for now, the volatility is fun if you are trader/investor but not so much if you are using bitcoins to actually pay for something.

your post makes absolutely no sense.  china holds a massive amount of us bonds,  about a trillion usd.  the last thing china wants to do is to devalue the dollar.  doing that would be like shooting yourself in the foot.

i doubt it... because nothing really changed in the last 7 days... no additional addresses were added/removed/imported/etc.
see what makes this complicated is that i have almost 5000 transactions in this wallet... which makes it hard to debug.
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:18:09
it is not sustainable/practical to backup after each transaction, obviously.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:07:54
ok... although your understanding of the transaction flow is probably accurate,  i would like to empirically test this.   it should be very easy to do.  
if what you say is indeed correct,  then making backups of wallet.dat or extracting the private key and storing it somewhere on a piece of paper has to be done with the understanding that the original wallet has to be "abandoned" afterwards, because if you DO NOT abandon it, and keep using it, and over time, you will "bleed away" some of the funds, which will not be evident if you continue to use the original wallet, but if you lose your original wallet.dat due to hard-disk failure,  the backed up copy will only contain a fraction of the funds...
