Trezor is more isolated and secure, android for usual transactions. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:03:17
Really nice approach on things, I like most of them.

What is so special about this miner named KnCMiner ?
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:57:06
I think it's not worth it. I think more time will be need to start profit form it, invest it in bitcoin purchase, it's a better option. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:17:21
This guy knows with tricks and "magic".
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:51:59
I don't think so, it could help but not really resolve it. There are other factor that indicates that.
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:10:20
  take a look on this.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:34:22
I never used Brave browser, where I can find some more info about it? Thanks.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:43:06
Try the support, perhaps they have reasonable answer for this. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:39:48
If we look back a couple of weeks, I think it will rise over $600, but no one can tell for sure. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:19:28
Use Electrum or MultiBit HD, there's no need for syncing. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:20:30
I think it's pretty much the same for a while, more fee provide fastest confirmation. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:08:58
Change you antiviral program and hope be more aware when you install something on you PC in future.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:33:30
I see you point in there and it rocks. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:49:16
Never thought that way, clearly this could happen. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:09:56
Cos it on my own, I keep the coins and can stay anonymous.
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:11:26
Try with MultiBit HD. It's better wallet. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:19:13
Circle, gemini or hard wallet like electrum, via mobile by Breadwallet or Mycelium. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:55:15
Wait until next week, hope it will be fixed. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:01:06
Yes, it's true, just I'm a MultiBit user and that's way mention first. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:31:25
I think localbitcoins is the best option. I'm satisfied so far. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:13:10
I think 50k will be enough for me. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:15:18
Miners will do it and gain a fee from every transaction. Maybe it will be less paid but still equipment already is here. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:13:58
It's a really nice video, I enjoyed. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:20:51
Yes, you can, you have resolve this by now, right?
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:54:25
I think sometimes can go up to 20%, so 9% is fair enough I hope. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:07:23
This is awesome idea, i was searching for some stuff like this the other day.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:30:39
How soon will be that?
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:12:23
Circl or purse.io. Nice and easy. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:22:18
So what stop them to that again?
@_date: 2016-06-08 20:00:36
Satoshi from future? I stop reading after that. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:23:27
So for almost a year, can't wait. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:04:27
It's not bad at all, actually is really really great. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:26:07
Of course I'm, can wait for the games to start. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:17:27
I think it's already resolved and will be available soon. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:05:38
Coinify.com or circle.com 
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:35:43
