Nice shell for a BFL miner in the corner there.

It may happen to coincide that it shares an intriguingly similar public key.

Oh dear, looks like it's time to upgrade my water cooling loops again.

Well, this made front page.

I asked the same question a while back. Turns out it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 26,959,946,667,150,639,794,667,015,087,019,630,673,637,144,422,540,572,481,103,610,249,216.

So how's life on the edge?

So if the code can handle greater difficulty, that brings up the other point I made. What happens when there's more than one block with the same hash? Or would the code also increase the number of bits in the block hash?

[I think BFL finally delivered.](

Oh that's nice. Looks like Detroit is starting to get competition now.

Yep, saw that when I was looking over coinmap. Place is called Cassava. A whole chain of pizzerias there takes it but it's through Menufy or something like that so they're not explicitly accepting it directly.

The only way to destroy them for sure is to send them all to 1AWewiNPTfvKA5dopSKi6EnfmyEXBgRXH9. Deleting your wallet.dat only "hides" them but they will always remain unless you send them to that address which will automatically forward them to a cryptographically inaccessible location.

Hey, if I buy any of these through eBay, can I pay with bitcoin? Paypal and I no longer have a business relationship and most redditors here can probably guess why. Also, when are you auctioning 1-10?
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:50:09
At first guess, I'd think something to do with business account policies. The idea of a business account is to allow employees to bill travel directly to the company. I'd take shot and say that having Bitcoin Builder treat users as "employees" isn't exactly kosher by Uber's standards.

Whether or not BB returns leftover funds isn't exactly of Uber's concern though, is it? All they should care about is sending BB a bill at the end of the month, just like any other business account, and receiving payment for said bill.

Time to 1099 all the users then, that'll make it legit enough and no one should have any issues with it.

Still waiting to see Whole Foods on that list.
