It's a good book but I do remember a couple parts starting to make some conspiracy theoryish claims that weren't really backed up with evidence. It didn't really affect the overall message though

It's only that way in English because that's how we say it out loud. It's November 2nd, 2017. We don't say 2 November 2017. As long as we don't do dates the way the Romans did in okay with it.

Fuck I knew I should have taken off those glasses

I sent bitcoin directly to them
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:28:37
lol classic
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:20:59
It was on chain, haven't set up my node yet
@_date: 2019-04-23 23:26:32
It was btc directly. Confirmations didn't take very long. They were good with two. I was having more trouble getting good internet reception than anything else. Fee was equivalent of like 35 cents.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:21:31
Not even CLOSE
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:31:45
About .0045 BTC with two drinks. Was surprisingly cheap
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:29:06
Just bitcoin. The reception wasn't great in the restaurant and they don't have public WiFi so I had to WANT IT

I'm still playing with it, I've been using Alton Brown's plus a little bit of powdered milk. Now that it's nicer outside I can finally get my propane grill based pizza oven jig. Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2019-04-23 07:02:50
Thanks juneburger. Always feels good to be assured :)

They're not prescription glasses they're blue blocker glasses that I wear for sleepy purposes.
I know I'm a pretty good lookin dude but this picture isn't my finest moment, lol. I'm confident in myself and I do just fine thanks for your concern.
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:56:05
It was pretty dang cheesey by anyone's standards.

With any luck I can make people regret not being me now
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:24:54
I did not.
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:55:59
There's so much stereotype going on here it's not lost on me, don't worry. I have a poorly maintained pizza blog too to round it all out.
PizzAndy.com if you're interested

She gets more than you I'd wager
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:29:32
Just visiting :) glad to spread the word!
@_date: 2019-04-25 04:13:21
but not blockchains it would seem
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:01:09
I am what I am. Take it or leave it

no u
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:53:21
I don't live in the area I was just visiting :) Thanks for the offer though!
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:57:54
I'm offended in so many ways right now
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:58:31
Around .0045 BTC, Miner fee was like the equivalent of 40 cents
@_date: 2019-04-23 23:28:28
Don't live in LB I was just visiting an old friend, I'll pass along the tip though!
@_date: 2019-04-23 07:26:40
You'll just have to take my word for it unless you call them
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:27:18
They were fine with just two
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:34:37
Oh I mean, don't tell me what to do!
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:38:04
Shit, with replies like this I regret it already
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:25:38
This was a massive pizza even for the US. We were all surprised how big it was
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:28:09
Nah it was on chain
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:28:24
Guess I'll have to pull something else out of my repitoir
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:49:22
Ideally you'd have a full node to verify but manage your own private keys at the very least
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:16:44
FREE MARKET BITCHES
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:47:56
I'd do it for probably like 10-20 BTC depending on how fast it's needed.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:40:37
It's a good book but there are some conspiracy theoryish undertones. I listened to it about a year ago so I can't specifically remember what thing made me feel that way. Most of it is solid though
