Wow, thanks for that. I feel like the litecoin community is confused. The gold standard amount of confirms for btc is 6 based on the chance of it being fraudulent dropping. The fact that many ltc sites wait for 6 seems to be a mistake then. To have a similar amount of security they should be at 24 it seems.    
I feel many people with ltc think the amount of confirms is equivalent, rather than it just being four times as many increments.

Until someone makes a scrypt ASIC.

You can also easily steal stuff with zero confirms.  
A 2.5 minute block is a four-fold increase in confirmation speed compared to bitcoin...  
Although the scrypt change seems to be more of what makes it safe against large bitcoin mining pools than an advantage of the currency. Many pools could just switch to a small sha256 currency and corrupt it instantly. Can't do that with litecoin.

I'm confused at your position. I agree with the merged mining point, that is what I'm saying is an advantage in terms of the survival of litecoin-- its not an advantage over bitcoin.  
And the zero confirmation thing is obviously the same as bitcoin at zero confirmations, its the speed of confirmations that makes it better for litecoin.  
 &gt;It's only a four fold increase in speed on the first block.  
What? I may be misinformed. Correct me if i'm wrong, but I thought btc is 10 minutes for every block and ltc is 2.5. So a very prudent 6 confirmation transaction would take 15 minutes for ltc and an hour for btc.

Agreed, and it is likely inevitable if litecoin survives. Kind of funny that one of the original stated reasons of litecoin was that cpu mining was  the best for scrypt so normal non-gpu using people could mine it. Then GPU mining was discovered to be 10x better than using a cpu. Eventually ASICs will take over. Sort of sad really.
