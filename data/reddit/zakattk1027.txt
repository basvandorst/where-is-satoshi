I had to dump all of mine around 6900 usd bc of the expenses. Im really hoping for a low bottom some time around next weekend

I think BTC will dip hard, then sky rocket again once everyone flips their BCH back into BTC

There used to be more of them. Out in the suburbs, in Rockford, etc but you don't make much for having them in your place of business

People have a really short memory, or they're new and are scared. Either way, I really wish there was a crypto sub that was only news related. Reading all of this crying and  toxicity is getting real fucking old

I'm fine. I didn't do enough to understand what crypto currency was prior to two months ago. My biggest issue is with the way in which people view the "investment". I don't ever really plan on cashing out. I want to continue buying, then once Ive exponentially grown my purchasing power (measured by USD) I'll spend btc directly with retailers who accept it.
