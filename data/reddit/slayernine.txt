It is good for paying out a big class action suit against it for losing money?

I have no idea if it is insured.  Wait I'll look it up....
*"This insurance policy does not cover damages resulting from a specific user's loss, such as the losses resulting from a compromise of the customer login credentials. Coinbase's insurance also contains standard policy exclusions (e.x. force majeure). Should information regarding this coverage materially change, we’ll update this and other relevant pages in a timely manner."*

There was a sign in attempt from Ukraine about an hour before the BTC was stolen.

I have two factor on the email account.  The 2FA is still enabled on coinbase.  I even have 2FA required for all transactions on Coinbase.  I don't even understand how this could have happened with these settings. I haven't been getting any notifications from Coinbase even regarding this transaction.  I only happened to check my account this morning and saw it.

Hi There!
Thank you for bringing this to our attention, I have put a hold on your account’s ability to login for the time being until you are certain that your account is secure.
We have a few questions that will help us begin isolating the incident:
1) Did you receive any unexpected messages from Coinbase or other services before the attack and during it? (Either emails or text messages)
2) When was your last successful login before the attack, and what was the last transaction you authorized?
3) Is there any other information you believe may help us?
If you have any questions please let me know and I’ll be glad to help. We look forward to hearing back.

Sorry, yes I did right away I emailed them.
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:02:54
I was only using Google Authenticator.  I've never used Authy.  When I got an email from Authy I went and googled who they were.  I was careful not to click on any links in that email.

Update: Mike and Authy support can't fix the compromised account and have suggested to make a new one...

I heard back from Authy! They have your phone number correctly associated with your e-mail but for some reason the fraudulent phone change disassociated your Authy profile from your Coinbase.com account... At your convenience, please create a new account on coinbase.com/signup. I’ll take care of closing your old account once completed. Thanks for your help here!"

Didn't do that but... I did leave my password manager open overnight on my desktop.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:13:30
I've been talking to Coinbase support for awhile now.  They gave me back access to my account after over a week of going back and forth.  However the 2 factor authentication with authy is not working and appears to be compromised in some manner.  This is very concerning and I suspect there is security issue related to Authy.  I can reset and re-register my phone with Authy but coinbase 2 factor still doesn't show up in the Authy app.  SMS codes from Coinbase don't come to my phone anymore despite the registered phone showing up as my phone number.

I appreciate the reminder but it looks like that would not have helped much.  I suspect an attacker gained direct access to my desktop via Teamviewer.
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:33:19
I'm feeling super paranoid about a virus ATM but I've been through my computer at work and home as well as my phone.  So far I've found nothing.
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:29:24
This is probably the best answer to this problem.
@_date: 2016-06-28 03:51:17
Update: I was using Google Authenticator and somehow an Authy account that I did not control was set up and used to authenticate the 2 factor.  Coinbase support and Authy are unable to fix this issue and have suggested abandoning the account.  I think the attacker may have exploited Authy in some manner.

I'm a bit worried that mass refunds will just screw over the people who can't get refunds because BFL might go out of business due to the refunds.
@_date: 2013-09-19 17:40:44
What if I actually want to still get my order?  I still don't feel convinced that I should refund my order.  I'm fairly confident they will ship my order eventually.  I would never buy from them again but I think some of you guys are going a bit overboard.
