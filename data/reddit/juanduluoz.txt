I'm not surprised.  Brian the little bitch armstrong has been doing everything in his power to fuck with Bitcoin.
1. Supports segwit2x,  claims "I want to see what the market decides"
2. Launches Bitcoin Cash when it was directly timed with a difficulty adjustment and mempool spam.
3. Pegs Bitcoin Cash to $7000 per coin, stops all trading then broadcasts to the world bcash is coming.
4. Refuses to implement segwit as a way to "punish" Bitcoin
5. Uses Bitcoin in the most inefficient way possible.
6. Dedicates resources to "Toshi", instead of Bitcoin
7. Does not own Bitcoin.  Only Eth.

LTC has 2.5 minute blocks and segwit, which makes it faster and gives transaction ids you can actually count on.   Bitcoin Cash is a horrible instant "cash" platform, same as Bitcoin.  WHY?  Because blocks can take anywhere between 1 min to 2 hours.  Commerce on-chain was tried in 2012-2015, it wasn't successful because it's a shitty experience.    Bitcoin Cash wants to re-live that failure.

I can imagine exchanges having LN channels between each other creating a huge pool of money used for arbitrage.

Breaking consensus for a short term scaling issues has a horrible risk/reward.  Bitcoin is thinking big and a little fee congestion was predicted years ago.  Please note that 90% of the fee congestion is from miners jamming the mempool to push prices up, and then mining their own transactions. 
Miners are processing their spam, and the highest tx fees.   The graph is obvious.  Take a look.

Segwit gives us that in 4 weeks.  Hardforks are against the bitcoin ethos of immutability.    Majority of early adopters will not support a hardfork unless Core leads it, with science, not emotions, or appeals to Satoshi.

Higher bandwidth, storage, and bootstrap time all cost money and time.   We know from life that when the cost of something increases there will be less of it.   Increasing costs WILL have a centralizing affect and nodes will concentrate into the hands of the few who can afford it, in the richest countries.
Increasing block size with a hardfork, is such a ridiculous thing to do at this stage. 
Bitcoin isn't Snapchat. It's not a fad being built for rebellious millennials. 
Bitcoin has to survive the long haul.  Even if fees increase to $100, it means it provides real utility to those that use it.  If you want the next trendy coin, jump on Eth or Dash.  You won't be missed here.


Yes, that solution is segwit.

Because it has an amazing promise.   Digital gold.   
I understand that young people have a hard time understanding such a phenomenon.   But the basic principles of Bitcoin are solid.   The only thing that sucks is that it's difficult to scale AND keep it decentralized, which is exactly what keeps the principles from changing.   Bitcoin is proof that we can spontaneously create our own store of value based on technology and does not rely on banks. 
Governments and banks have gold.  That's the foundation of all the money they create.   If all their influence fades and everyone forgets to pay their bills, they still hold gold.
Bitcoin is the digital version of that.    We have to make sure this foundation is solid otherwise nothing else matters.  If you split bitcoin, then it means it can be fragmented again, and again, and again, until it resembles our broken ass governments.
We're not hardforking.  
Scroll down to BCU/BTC and see what the market thinks of your ideas.

Scaling on-chain to meet "mainstream" adoption is suicide for decentralization.    Decentralization is the most important attribute of Bitcoin and ensures it can't be cooped by special interests.   If this sacrafices short term adoption.  So be it.   
In the long term, Bitcoin will be unstoppable, while all other crypto-chains end up in datacenters, bitcoin will be the only one that can be ran at home and nearly any place in the world.   That's the big difference between Core devs and pretty much all other altcoin devs.    Bitcoin isn't about getting rich quit.  It's about remaining being decentralized for eternity.

@_date: 2017-03-17 22:31:21
I can't think of any market when a symbol is reused for an instrument so similar, that it would create mountains of confusion for purchasers and users.  
BU is basically a buy out and complete replacement of management, development, consensus and software, but still attempting to keep the same name.  
Have you read BU's Articles of Confederation?  
IMO, It's a complete disgrace to Bitcoin's ethos. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:33:09
Your views are counter to Bitcoin.  Either you educate yourself, or fork off!  You won't be missed.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:49:49
BU is not a really a solution.  They are acting malicious to try and hardfork bitcoin to create a precedent so that they can change anything they want in the future.   That's their entire mission.  
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:17:41


I'm not assuming anything.  I know that without a doubt, since I'm a software engineer, that Bitcoin's decentralization will be threatened by scaling on-chain, due to the simple fact that it is a flood network system.


I've heard this for the past 2 years.   Stop being a chicken little.  


It's not that 3 tp/s or even 10 tp/s is the limit, it's about cost increase over time in bandwidth, CPU verification, and bootstrapping new nodes.   
The biggest issue with BTC is that it is designed to resist hardforks.  So unless 95% agree, we're at a stalemate.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:22:52
Segwit it is!
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:39:24

@_date: 2017-03-18 23:21:07


of course,  big-O


Depends on which part of the system you're talking about.  There are various levels of complexity in Bitcoin.


We do not care.   That is not important.  The systems integrity is far more important than on-chain TP/s.


This is not expected by the engineers designing it.  Keeping Bitcoin decentralized and immutable is the most important property of the entire system. 


NO,   51% of miners can attack the chain and rollback transactions.  That is all.     
The reality is that miners can hardfork anytime they want.  The issue that everyone fails to grasp is that the moment they do, they'll be creating an altcoin with an empty order book and no network effects.   
So we tell miners, go ahead.  Fork Off.  You'll be mining worthless coins, because you're no longer supporting the rules that the economic majority wants you to inforce.   
If they refuse to support the rules we define, and try attacking us, then we'll change the PoW and mine with GPUs again.
Miners are expendable.

That's pretty contrived.   
Barrier to entry is low, there is a small profit motive in running a node, BUT most importantly you'll be able to transact instantly with anyone else on the network for fractions of a cent.   This should give rise to lots of new services like gambling, asset swaps, etc.   All trustless without 3rd party risk.

You are 100% correct.    Bitcoin is the only rare thing on the internet and that's the killer app that the internet has always needed.   Provable scarcity.  Now everything else is possible by building on top of it.  Identity, Property, Money.  All of the silos can be broken down and decentralized.  
Why can't Peter Schiff comprehend the value of this invention?   Is it because he doesn't understand the internet?  Is his view of money too limited?

they need nodes to replay their blocks on their centralized shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:49:23
Garzik refuses to add any protections into their client to ensure a clean split, so what's likely to happen is the the segwit2x will be sybilled to death, because they won't be able to find any other compatible nodes.   
Luckily Core devs are adding immediate disconnect from any nodes to look like segwit2x, to ensure they split without being a nuance to the real bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:34:08
There is no reason to attach known identities to the nodes.   Give me a list of nodes that want to open channels and the amount, and I'll connect to them without any other information.  
We're building trustless systems, without 3rd party risk.   Monopolies don't have any power because the system has perfect competition.


@_date: 2017-12-13 17:32:33


Are you sure about that?  Because Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies work as a medium of exchange.  Why would we need to use fiat currencies printed by private banks, when everything of value has token, and these tokens can be swapped nearly instantly with anyone else on the network? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:14:26
So let's build LN, then see the topology and use cases evolve, then go from there.   It's completely pointless to hardfork when majority of transactions aren't even using the more efficient segwit tx type yet.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:37:49

@_date: 2018-03-29 17:27:44
All loans, are simply pulling future earnings into the present.  There is a limit on this for humans, because we die, however, the government lives for centuries, so it's ability to pull from the future and have its populace pay the bills extends further than we expect.  But it's all the same, there's a limit and eventually debt repayments overtake all, causing stagnation and default.
A rich society, would have a balanced government budget, and its populace would have a possible savings rate, instead of increasing debt.

The positives are hilarious, because it's all about managing the issues created by having a variable money supply in the first place.  


Wouldn't be an issue, if the government didn't have the ability to spend what it doesn't have.


Wouldn't be an issue if banks couldn't create money out of thin air and centrally dictate interest rates.


Would balance itself out naturally if the central banks and governments could not change the variables of the economy each time they wanted to get elected.

You seem to be saying that debt is essentially for prosperity. Which is an idiotic statement unless you never plan on repaying the loans. The US has pulled more wealth from future generations, than most countries and it might make it look "prosperous" today, but eventually all growth will stagnate as the cost of repaying debt squeezes all budgets and brings everything to a halt or default.

Hey EFF, if you don't support corporate takeovers of FOSS then you should NOT be using Bitpay to process your Bitcoin.   Bitcoin allows you to run your own node and not rely on third parties.    Bitpay is trying to use its coorporate influence to change bitcoin the same way corporations used the W3C to add dirty DRM.
Drop in replacement for Bitpay.

A few people who mine and run bitcoin related businesses met up in new york last year and decided they want to hardfork bitcoin to make the blocksize 2MB. It became the new york agreement(NYA).   Engineers however, thought it was a bad idea, warned it would split bitcoin in two, cause people to lose money, cause confusion, etc.    NYA people don't care and still want their hardfork.
The mess you're looking at, is an attempt to rebase hardfork code from 0.14.x to 0.15.0, which resulting in massive merge conflicts that need to be resolved by hand.
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:02:28

Yup, the way hashpower fluctuations on bcash proves that.

Seriously go fuck yourself.   
You are short sighted and don't understand the order of operations.  Bitcoin can't become a currency without being a stable store of value first.   Once Bitcoin is the defacto store of value because of its immutability, fixed inflation schedule, globally accessible, and deep liquidity (reduced volatility), then we can talk about "currency"  but that is years if not decades away.     


You have no idea what you're talking about.     You can't start with a "currency" and work backwards.    The USD started by being backed by gold. In fact, most countries around the world bootstrap their currency on the back of gold.   Is gold a currency???  Nope.  It's merely a base store of value that majority of humans agree too.  A shared delusion.    Bitcoin needs time to create it's own narratives and shared delusion that it has value.  
Being able to buy shit on openbazaar with bitcoin, is the lowest priority.

What else is there to gain?   
Immutability and scarcity are worth trillions.  Hedge against inflation is huge.  Hedge against government issued instruments(fiat,bonds,treasuries) and as non-correlated asset as Peter Theil, Mark Cuban recently mentioned. 
Anyone who thinks spending is required for Bitcoin to be a success is either young, or broke.  Because if you've actually had any experience in real life saving money, you would appreciate the properties of bitcoin the ensure that your hard work is not being inflated arbitrarily.  I rarely spend Bitcoin the same way I don't spend my 401k.


Ya, you're right.  Currency is worthless.  You get it, then trade it for something else.   Anyone that actually makes money exchanges it for stocks, real estate, bonds, paintings, etc.   Currencies are shit by design.   It's a low barrier and not something to strive to become.

Bitcoin is not going to change to save your app. If you thought Bitcoin would have low fees forever and remain decentralized then you have no idea what Bitcoin is.


AKA, a global incorruptible store of value that has trillion $$ market cap potential.    Bitcoin is not simply a payment network, like VISA, or Paypal, that we scale up for all of these pointless apps.  It's much bigger than that.   Just look at what Peter Thiel has to say about it.   Small blockers have known this for years, but now other people are starting to wake up to what bitcoin really is what it means to the world.

"regulated" currencies are the problem Bitcoin is going to fix.  
Their "regulation" is actually market manipulation which results in supply/demand imbalances.  Just because all our junk is denominated in USD, GBP, JPY, etc, doesn't mean they aren't changing in value.
If we had deflationary currencies the price of all goods would be going down, but instead all gains in efficiency are being stolen by the printers of fiat currency.    The reckoning is coming.  Bitcoin's bubbles will continue, until fiat collapses into a default spiral to infinity.

No, we need more of this.  We need to politically shame BU and all of its supporters because they have caused nothing but drama and bullshit over the past 2 years all because they're too stupid to understand how bitcoin actually works.    Seriously fuck those guys.  
They've been bitching about 10 cents fees for over a year, saying how it's stalling adoption, and yet the price continues to soar.
They spewed so many damn lies all because they want their fucking hardfork and big blocks.   Now Segwit is here, with a block size increase, running smoothly on litecoin, while BU just suffered another catostri=ophic bug in their highly touted xthin blocks.   I've seen nothing but PURE fucking incompetence and hubris, come from BU, Classic, XT, folks.
If you ever thought that BU was even a remotely good idea then FUCK YOU TOO.  
I'm so sick of dealing with you fuicking imbred dumb fucking noobs who don't understand anything except sound bytes and cling onto every conspiracy theory that comes along.  Herp derp  "Muh censorship", therefore BU must be a good idea????

What are your issues with layer 2?     I like LN because of instant microtransactions.  I have several app ideas that can thrive on such a network, but are impossible on-chain, no matter the blocksize.
I don't believe the criticisms of segwit because it's already running on litecoin, viacoin, and a few others.  I've followed the development of it since it landed on Elements Alpha like 2 years ago.

You're thinking adversarially because you have the historical context of previous attempts that were squashed by governments.    For Bitcoin to survive, it must be small, nimble and able to run anywhere.  Essentially a coachroach.   


We have not won yet.  Banks and governments look somewhat cooperative, but until we have hundreds of bitcoin exchanges in the US, it's far too easy for the government to choke out Coinbase, Gemini, Poloniex and lay the smack down on crypto currencies.   
Bitcoin is the foundation that all other cryptos are built from.  Not just code, but the idea and shared liquidity pools.   Bitcoin should have the safest most conservative roapmap and the most decentralized, because if Bitcoin can be subverted, then all the rest can too.
We can't play lose and fast with Bitcoin.  There is too much at stake here.  Sovereign immutable digital gold is off the charts innovation and is changing the face of finance forever.

That's like saying having a large savings account, doesn't mean your part of the economic majority.
Savings is wealth.    Majority of coins haven't moved in years.   Are they not relevant any longer?  Are they not part of the economic majority?    The churn of coins in day to day activity is tiny and that's what all of these services cater to.
The economic majority are definitely the hodlers.

IMO, Our current devs have the right priorities for bitcoin to ensure it can last and remain decentralized at the network level.   If the network isn't decentralized, then nothing else matters.  I don't care how many devs, commits or clients exist.  If nodes cost $20k, it's dead to me, and no other metric will change that.
The only two metrics I care about are node decentralization and miner decentralization.   Everything else is second.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:01:34
Why does he pretend like Segwit is something "new" and is catching everyone off guard?
Majority of the ecosystem is ready for segwit, we've just been waiting on miners.  That's it.  Why does it venture off into this 2x bullshit, when blocks are not full and all the services below can take advantage of segwit in a few weeks.  Segwit is a softfork too, so if you're not ready yet, you can upgrade at your own pace.
 
He's clearly selling a narrative here.

After we've softforked all the features we can, then we'll have a look at what kind of hardfork can be done.    DOing a hardfork at this stage, is wreckless and retarded.


Segwit raises that limit to around 1.8 - 2.2 mb.  So obviously we won't be at 1MB forever.


You can't replicate immutability.  Bitcoins resistance to change is the only reason it's worth what it is.   That's how we got from $1 to $2500.   Segwit2x can fork off, but when they do, they just made an altcoin with another 21M digital tokens.

Bitpay and Coinbase aren't doing anything novel.  It's only a matter of time before Newegg and Steam process their own payments on their own nodes and cut out the middleman.    I agree that Bitpay and Coinbase are helping the ecosystem grow, but we don't NEED them, like we need decentralization.    If nodes become too large and combersome, then Newegg, Steam and many other businesses won't ever be able to cut out the middleman.   
They want big blocks because they want to keep their position in the economy.  Once we build efficient level2, we'll go right around them and they know this.
The entire purpose of this blockchain movement is to remove all 3rd parties and replace them with smart contracts.

The inflation schedule created the demand to hold Bitcoin.    Ethereum doesn't have that.  Eth relies on usage metrics and speculation of future usage.  We have yet to see any dapp solve a real problem, which requires real gas usage at scale.   All we have are ICOs shifting value between peoples wallets with a different name on some token.  None of them have generated any real demand for their tokens other than speculation of their future use.     I'm sure some token will actually garner usage someday, but  we have no evidence so far.  
Meanwhile, Bitcoin's value proposition and utility is clear.  All this Eth hype reminds me of the Counterparty, NXT, Bitshares platforms that had great promise, but failed to deliver..

Right, and this is achieved through Bitcoin's well defined inflation schedule.  If bitcoin remains decentralized and doesn't hardfork to the whims of the miners, masses or figure heads, it will outperform all other cryptos over time.   In the short term, I have no doubt that Eth will climb to astronomical levels,  but Bitcoin will win the long game.
