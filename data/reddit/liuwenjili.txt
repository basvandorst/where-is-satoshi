Why do you think we need to use bitcoin on a daily basis to buy food etc? Why do you think bitcoin's ultimate goal is to replace fiat? Why hodling mentality is wrong? supply and demand, at the right price, hodlers will sale. How many bitcoin does hodlers control vs whales that manipulate the price? do your math, 1000 hodlers dump 1 bitcoin simultaneously at the moment is 10 million--- maybe drop 1000 dollar on price?  Bitcoin is not going to die anytime soon unless the every government on the planet ban it.

bitcoin is still to young to be used as a currency for daily transaction--- the volitility will drop overtime. Also, there's a new interpretation of bitcoin's function as store of value (which is not satoshi originally proposed), but that concepts seems more reasonable. THE VALUE of bitcoin is where human as a whole believes it. You don't pay with gold but you still consider gold as an asset that can be changed to fiat for daily usage. Bitcoin will evolve over time. You are right, for doing business, fiat settlement still makes more sense right now --- but when China launched cryptocurrency, and libra somehow manage to lauch as well. You will see a adoption of those as a method of payment, especially for international settlement. Yet, bitcoin will still find its place in a new world. 
It is not impossible that US ban bitcoin, however, it will take majority of the world government ban bitcoin together for that to happen.  For example, China banned trading etc in China--- I can tell you my Chinese friends who are interested in crypto found their way to get their hands on bitcoin through all kinds of methods and can turn bitcoin back to Chinese Yuan without any issue (the fee is higher though). So unless majority of the central govenrments ban bitcoin together (like if you have bitcoin you would end up in jail), bitcoin will continue to survive and thrive and find its place in this world. As for using it for business, it still make more sense to use fiat (if you are a long term believer in bitcoin's value, then whatever you earn today with bitcoin may turn into more profits down the road)

Very interesting post--- just registered with Kraken (US). did not wire transfer any fund yet. Their support staff seems nice though.

I am a bitcoin believer. I believe bitcoin will continue to thrive, but I just don't think I will be alive when bitcoin evolves, maybe my kids or grandkids would see thay day.
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:14:08
very unlikely to be honest. Bankster/central authority as gangsters will not let power go back to the people. Greed will overtake what BTC stands for. Still, hodl to the end of the world.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:46:09
Use a trading platform like kraken or coinbase pro.
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:36:30
your coin is not insured on coinbase, your fiat is up to 250k. not your key not your coin though. I keep coins on coinbase over a year now without any issue, but traded from time to time. planning on hodl part of it with a ledger soon
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:41:23
it is the first thing for me
 second one is should I buy bitcoin now
third is should i buy a house
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:38:49
You are still seeing bitcoin as a way of payment/transfer. I partly agree with you on this. bitcoin is an "asset" which could potentially become widely adopted as store of value, especially for the rich  --- gold has been around for thousands of years and it is still here. We do not buy stuff directly with gold but if I give you gold and ask for some USD say at 80% of market price, will you trade with me? fiat has its issue but we are going to use it without any other options. Satoshi's vision may never be fullfilled but bitcoin is going to live and serve another purpose. I want to make money with bitcoin but at the same time, I believe in bitcoin. Even if bitcoin is banned throughout the world, I am still going to mine with my computer.

Use coinbase pro. I used coinbase pro and kraken. Coinbase pro is easier to use with slightly higher fee. then transfer to ledger. both platform are pretty safe for storage at this point. Haven't loss any satoshi yet.

I don't think I will be alive to see that day, if it comes.

I guess we will wait and see the market reaction. My reaction will be like throwing a rock into the sea.
I am sitting back and wait for the dip that may or may not happen and the moon that may or may not happen. I don't know why I like bitcoin in the first place anymore.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:27:16
I didn't put any money in yet. still using coinbase pro for now.
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:43:45
Just my thoughts (could be totally wrong)--- this could be another fake news + pump and dump case. (they are not open for business and postpone the openingdate of btc etf). If this time it did get approved and launched, then we moon sooner than expected or get rekt by whales. either way, it is good for bitcoin.

Here's the thing. If bitcoin fails in 30-40 years when he retires, he got nothing but bitcoin. But if bitcoin prevails, he will have at least 10x if not more than what he can get with the super fund or whatever you call it. This is like gambling your life to be either nothing (10% gold) or super rich retirement. Do you have the gut to take that risk? He took it and so far, it is ok.  Do you think bitcoin can be better in 30 years? I bet you do but are you willing to bet your life on it? Now, that's the real question. His choice and he will live up with it. He already made up his mind with 90%.

True whales are not going to dump bitcoin unless absolute necessary. bitcoin is a tool for them to manipulate the market, make them more money. Holding it only make whatever is still circulation worth more. The question is, as ordinary people, we may have less than 1 bitcoin--- how are you going to gain financially as the market mature?  We will never make as much as what they make, but a couple of bitcoins may secure your retirement plan down the road. Adoption is not your concern, whales will do it for you. The adoption of crypto is a game between traditional finance system and a new gamer in town. We can pick which one we want to use, but they will both exist for a long time until one wins. The only good thing about bitcoin is you can actually own it without any central authority mess with it. your money in the bank is just credit for other people that you trust the bank will give it to you when you needed. If you know how to store bitcoin properly, your bitcoin is your bitcoin. Yoi can trust the blockchain that your bitcoin is there and only accessible by you. 
Adoption of any crypto as a method of payment is not realistic at the moment due to volitality. The retails that accepts bitcoins right now are in for the long game.

There are skeptical people here who still think bitcoin is not going to thrive. I tried to convince my coworker to invest in bitcoin. One guy knows bitcoin back in 2013 starts investing---he knows bitcoin because his friends back then tried to convince him to invest when the price is below hundreds. All his friends are in pretty good postion with money to travel around the world, new house, new car etc. Note we were all college students back then. 
I tried to convince the older coworker, he knows the market by looking at charts etc and told me the price is going to drop in the next two years and not going to recover. Even a bubble of 50k USD per bitcoin is nonsense to him. 
I hope I get a chance to say it to his face--- I told you so.
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:02:23
Ride the wave. In any market, there are whales--- how you invest your money is none of my business. I am just simply stating bitcoin is likely to continue to grow in price with volitality. Hodl mentality is kind of right instead of trading. I traded for a while but only been able to made hundreds of dollars without significant gains. 
I am not putting faith in whale manipulation. You need to believe in bitcoin youeself. this is a new market that grows from nothing to 100+ billions in 10 years. Us ordinary investor has tiny influence on the price. Even if I could buy 10 or 100 bitcoins, the price won't move much.
I am telling you it will evetually breakout and never look back.(I am not sharing the source of this information publically, as you won't believe me or him anyway). If you really want to know, pm me and I will share his name. Good luck to you all who downvoted. It is a risky investment, but the gain is way more rewarding if you get in and get out at the right time. 
Mining is more of a hobby for me to contribute, even I lose a couple of dollars a month of electricity is ok.
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:47:01
I originally planned to invest \~20%. Then I talked to my wife about it --- then 20% becomes 80%. She did not really understand bitcoin, I just told her that it is very likely to perform very well in a couple of years.

Thanks. If they are so good at investing, they should be at a beach somewhere instead of lurking around.

To the whale--- bitcoin is just their status. You are not going to see billionnares waving their money around, they don't need to. We know the richesst man on earth have tons of money that they don't really spend, but it is theirs. Same as bitcoin, but those whales are most likely stay private. There will be more instituion investment in bitcoin to stir things up. 
The thing is even if a complete relaunch from block 1, whales who own mining farm (or they can make a mining farm larger than any ming farm right now) still has tons of advantage over us, and it will also not be a fair game. Bitcoin is here because we understand the value behind it and willing to play by the rules. The truth is satoshi's vision is more of an ideal world than reality, but the concept of an asset that is not controlled by central authority is what makes me believe bitcoin the most. As long as majorities of us miners stay decentralized, we can always believe in bitcoin. Whales are there because they have the capital, if their money is not in bitcoin, it will be in other markets--- stock, etf, gold you name it. They are here because they see the potential in crypto. We are most likely not able to remove oligarchs, but bitcoin provide us a new way to store our tiny wealth and gain significantly in the near future. 
I do want to see bitcoin succeed and evolve, but I am skeptical of it actually happening. 
For me… I am in for the retirement fund and my babies' college funds. aftet this bull market, most likely I will take my investment back and hodl the rest for 10+ years. If bitcoin failed in 10 years then I didn't lose anything. If I win, my family will be at a much better position and I will be under a lot less pressure financially.
We are in a world that evolves rapidly. Think about it, car, pc, internet, cel phones changed our way of living. Now we are going to see whether bitcoin could change our life. This is not those tech development, but a chess game between central banking system and crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:39:59
Agreed. The value of bitcoin is "intrinsic" that defined by human --- your understanding of bitcoin is what you think worth of bitcoin. In trader's view, bitcoin is just a speculative market asset for trading; in holder's view, bitcoin is something they precious and hold on for life (until it "moon" in their mind); I view bitcoin similar to you as a store of value. 
However, the majority of humanity still does not accept bitcoin or understand what it is. Like I explained it to my mother, she simply told me she did not trust in something she cannot see. 
Your view of bitcoin is all that matters, and one day as more and more people share the same view, bitcoin will evolve. Bitcoin has been evolving and "dead" a lot of times. Yet, bitcoin is still here and face future tests (governments, regulations, quantum computers, etc). I am in bitcoin because I want financial security for my family in ten or twenty years. Why do people invest in stocks? mutual funds? real estate or any investment at all? To make money is the ultimate goal. Invest in bitcoin is just a way to bet on the future of it and hope for huge reward compares to other investments. 
Whether bitcoin becomes a currency is not in our control but determined by governments. A limited supply of bitcoin is not good for the economy as people will be less likely to spend bitcoin and stack their satoshi on a daily basis. This is why I don't believe bitcoin will be used on a daily basis, but the idea of digital global currency is inevitable in the near future (Libra, Chinese digital currency backed by China). Fiat has its problem but bitcoin is not a good solution in my opinion. 
As a store value, bitcoin is good so far. If central banks consider it as an alternative to gold, then we will see some fast price discovery.
