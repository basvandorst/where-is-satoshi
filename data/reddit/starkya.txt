All of which are band-aids (each with serious downsides) to the fundamental issue that proof of work is a really shit and inefficient system once you try to scale it to industrial levels.

Which lets be honest also has issues.
There a lot of technical and efficiency issues to solve before any cryptocoin can become a viable replacement for VISA like digital transfer of funds, never mind outright replacement of fiat currency.
Scaling to millions of transactions per hour without sickening waste of energy is a real challenge.
It's actually disgusting how much energy each bitcoin transaction consumes (and all the excuses made to defend it I've read are pretty moronic).

With proof of work someone would need to have 51% of all mining computing power to have any kind of real influence over the validity of the blockchain. Really they'd need more like 66% if they wanted to maintain their control.
This would allow them to do things like double spend and hold transactions hostage.
So while it is possible it's bloody unlikely.
That said one person dominating a PoS system is also kind of unlikely, if one person rose to dominance and owned 51%+ (again more like 66% to utterly control it) of a PoS coin it would destroy the value of the coin as all users would lose confidence in it, dump and run from it.
So the very act of them seeking to control it by holding a majority stake would make their stake worthless.
The worry of PoS is that several large stake holders (adding up to that 66%) would join in collusion to secretly control the blockchain.
That and as anyone can join as a stakeholder in PoS (you just need to have your coins online at all times, and a raspberry pi can do that for $20 a year in electricity and $30 upfront.

Well let's assume that 1 transaction uses on average 400 bytes (bitcoins 1mb/2400).
So to get 7 million transactions per hour, you'd need to be able to handle ~1950 transactions per second.
So 1950 * 400 (bytes) * 600 (seconds - to give you a 10 min blockchain solve) would require each block to be 486 Megabytes.
At an average hashrate of 150 per day - the size of the blockchain after just 6 months would be 12.77 terabytes.

It doesn't work like that. 
Solving a hash is random, the time it takes is on average scales perfectly with more miners.
Miners are not in competition. It's like rolling a set of 5 six sided dice and trying to get all 6's.  
That's a 1/7776 chance, or ~99.987% chance of losing each roll.  
So after 5000 rolls there's a ~48% chance you'd have rolled 5 6's.    
To give yourself a ~ 99% chance of rolling 5 6's you'd need to roll ~33,000 times.
The probability of you rolling all 6s doesn't change if your mate grabs *another* 5 dice and start trying to do the same.
But it does half the average time until either one of you gets all 6's (assuming you roll at the same rate).
If 1000 people are rolling dice, it doesn't change your odds one bit, but it does reduce the average time between someone (anyone) rolling those 6's.
A thousand miners or 1 it takes the same average number of rolls of the dice to win. 
Edit: Oh and it is worth adding, the "difficulty" to mine bitcoins (as in solve a blockchain) is increased and decreased to maintain a hashrate of 1 winner per 10 mins.  
So to going back to dice, if 1000 people are now rolling dice, bitcoin then says "now you need to roll 6 dice and get all 6's to win". Adjusting the difficulty of winning so that someone wins every x-time.    
And you can't just keep rolling 5 dice and have a winner every 10 seconds instead of 10 mins, as you'd burn through the minable bitcoins (which is fixed, like a fixed price pool) in weeks instead of years.

Seriously, I don't get how anyone could believe for a second that a PoW coin could handle global level transactions like VISA, the energy requirements are just too huge and too expensive for a miniscule number of transactions.
If bitcoin had to handle ~7 million transactions per hour of VISA the entire planets computing and energy resources would need to be dedicated to it.

Each block has a limited number of transfers.
With a proof of work system increasing the TPS needs either more blocks mined faster (right now it's 1 per 10 min for 2400 transactions), or larger blocks.
The former is a huge energy spike, the latter makes storing the blockchain unfeasible after only a few months for anyone except large networked servers.

Yes but pure PoS leads to possible centralization, the very thing that cryptocurrency is supposed to avoid.  
Which is why many coins are looking into a kind of hybrid system.

I think most Americans who've never left America don't appreciate the biggest benefit of "free" (at point of access) healthcare.
That for 99% of working adults (who pay for the system), the worry and stresses of healthcare vanish. We don't have to worry about unexpected medical bills, or trips to the doctors. We don't have to worry about our insurance premiums or deductibles. 
Even if the actual bill per capita was higher (which it isn't it is almost half the US cost) it would be a price worth paying.
No one should ever have to worry about their life being ruined, or hell even their month due to an unexpected medical event or simple accident.  
Hell the only thing in my life that has the potential to hit me with an unexpected bill that might hurt me financially is my car (mechanical failure - it's insured for everything else) everything else is insured.  
The second biggest is probably a huge emphasis on preventative treatment, which is cheaper for the system and better for the patients. 
Sadly our right wing party is systematically destroying it thanks to the influence (monetarily and political) of US (and US inspired) private companies who want to profit here too.
