yay for generosity

Bro.. you do realize, at this very moment, there are sales taxes being collected on bitcoin transactions?
is right, this type of rhetoric is a cancer for @_date: 2013-03-30 06:52:21
Cool, thanks.

Remember Friendster?
Edit: Okay, so you covered this when you mentioned Prodigy and Compuserve (My bro racked up enormous bills on Compuserve more than once). But it actually is a blow to your argument. There's nothing stopping anyone from making another cyber/crypto currency that could really ruin BTC. Also, deflation.

Thanks. Is there a good Firefox plugin you can recommend for this?
@_date: 2013-03-13 08:10:53
Can you elaborate on the browser plugin option? And how it works? (Redundantly verifying certificates through third parties? Or what?)

Good way to look at it, except I think there will be disappointment for anyone expecting some final outcome. BTC is not going to end centralized currencies, and whether or not BTC itself fails, the proof of concept is already here IMO. BTC 2.0 would rise like a phoenix from the ashes of BTC's dead end.
There will be more decentralized currencies on the horizon, regardless of BTC's fate. Think of it like Friendster, Myspace, and Facebook merged with USD, EUR, and JPY. Sort of. It'll be an interesting ride, no matter what. The possibility of new currencies sprouting up with fundamentally different structures of creation is definitely uncharted waters, but I see no reason to think other people will not try to duplicate or improve upon what BTC has done.

Motherfucking THIS. I'm at the point where I am contemplating how, if I had just invested a few thousand when I started thinking about it seriously, I could pay off my student loans by cashing out now.

Totally agree. I don't really think any economic school is correct. Their prescriptions work better or worse in different contexts. But who cares? Bitcoin is cool as shit no matter what your economics or politics.
I'm right there with OP in finding it weird to be so interested in something the gold hoarder crowd is so enthusiastic about. I guess it fits nicely into my fuzzy area of liberal and libertarian sensibilities. With a heavy dash of excitement for technological possibility and DIY ethic.
Seems like the Austrians can't fathom why BTC might catch the interest of anyone who doesn't flip out about fiat currency or worship Ayn Rand/Paul, Ron.

Thanks bro

What software are you using for mining? I was thinking of trying it out, but I wasn't sure if there's decent software or if I should try to code my own or what.
@_date: 2013-03-13 09:09:12
Since the earlier post about how BTC works was like a month ago, I'll ask here. There are a couple points on which I am not clear.
1) I'm curious about more specifics regarding mining. How is the computation the miners are doing useful? Is it just a mechanism for slowing the "minting" of the currency, and a motivator for supplying infrastructure for the blockchain? How is the hash or whatever miners are trying to solve determined? How is its complexity (which is surely increasing over time) determined?
2) "[The miner] gets [his reward] from the voluntary fees that are included in each Bitcoin transaction." "Also, every time he publishes a block he's allowed to write his name in the new block and assign himself 25 newly minted bitcoins." So, if the miner gets both of these, he gets more than 25 BTC, yes? Now, how are the voluntary fees volunteered, when, why, and by whom (a transaction's sender, receiver, or both)? What would be the motivation for voluntarily giving fees to miners? Sounds sort of like a voluntary tax, lol.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:22:22
You're stretching on your use of the word voluntary. If there's no other way to feed yourself or your family but to submit to this system, it's not really voluntary. It is not reasonable to expect everyone can get into the owning class, either, so that's not a solution.
You want to know why people seek such an employment relationship? Because they have to. And those that don't end up begging, hustling, or thieving. There certainly are some of those people, too.
Brainwashed? Or resigned? If you look for it (say by asking the unprivileged), you will build a huge body of evidence that "resigned" is a great description of the economic life of a great many people.

You just can't call it a dedicated operating system. Give baby-step instructions on how to make a bootable CD/DVD, put in a troubleshooting section for people who may need to change their BIOS to boot DVD drive before HDD or for people without an optical drive to make a USB booter.
If you can get them that far, the rest of everything can be done with the easy-to-use software OP is talking about.
Edit: This is a way cheaper solution than hardware wallets, which I am not saying should not be created. I think both are good ideas.

We are ASICs. We are legion.
We decide transactions. All bitcoin are belong to us.
