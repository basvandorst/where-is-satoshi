It dipped almost 30% when it hit 11K...
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:46:29
Yes, I know it's done 90-something% dips...  Doesn't change the fact that you said a few hundred when it was a few *thousand*.

He specifically calls out BTC, not BCH...
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:05:47
Asking that question is blasphemy...
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:07:20
I don't think it will get to $10...
I don't think it will get to $100...
I don't think it will get to $1,000...
I don't think it will get to $10,000...

And upside down...
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:18:44
Or we can try to reinforce correct terminology in order to mitigate misinformation...  It wasn't a crash.

RemindMe! $1,000,000 BTC

Give it a couple days...
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:03:03
Most of the exchanges are getting hammered today and are up and down...
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:04:06


Can't you do the same with Coinbase?  I mean, it's a hold for a couple days, but you get the price you hit buy on.

Quality shit reply 10/10
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:21:58
No...  [Not really](

This doesn't always (often doesn't) translate into IT spend.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:47:23
I think you're being conservative with that 200 number...
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:48:49
Chase, and some other banks, will often block a first time transfer to known exchanges...  Let your bank know you're doing it so it doesn't disrupt your trade.

If I remember correctly, fees are from 0.1-0.25%, depending on trade volume...

If bitcoins were never used, they wouldn't be at this price...

More specifically, tweeted about [talking to Buffett about cryptocurrencies](

Do you want to correct their statement, or just quote them with snark...?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:25:42
It's not like they were the only exchange down...
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:33:42
Let's not assume it's the IT department's fault...  Not even a CIO is in sole control of their budget.  And, beyond budgetary constraints, you would have to assume they fully understood the mass of incoming new users.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:23:49
That's assuming they have the infrastructure to scale that high...  I don't believe they're using someone else's cloud.
The number of new users hit a record high because of all the 10k attention.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:23:02
Thanks...  I'm casually learning the ins and outs.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:13:00
[Here you go](
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:58:18
All of them are crashing...  Think of what kind of surge they're getting right now with all the media attention.  I even had a random friend, who doesn't know I have any coins, text me asking what bitcoin was.

Previously asked questions:
...is now $10, is it too late?
...is now $100, is it too late?
...is now $1,000, is it too late?

He's bonkers...  He's bound to do it regardless of this Bitcoin bet.

Served to him via enema by three third world prostitutes...  Seriously, he's that messed up.
