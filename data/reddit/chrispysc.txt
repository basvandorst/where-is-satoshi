I was curious what Meganet was so I googled it. The first result, meganet.com, is just a site full of ads and presumably some other stuff that my extensions hopefully filtered. So people, don't go there.

You could try making this exact post on the subreddit. It will certainly get visibility to the point where managers might very well contact you. The subreddit is like the subreddit in that it is the central hub of news/information and practically interested in the scene visits it.
Just do your research on the teams. [Here]( are the teams currently in the LCS. Some of the teams already have a lot of money going into them - like TSM &amp; CLG, Cloud 9. These guys are the top performers and get insane numbers for personal streams. I'm not 100% sure on their finances but I'm pretty sure a 5k sponsorship would be a drop in the ocean to them. If you could sponsor Dignitas or Curse it'd be great - they're well established and very popular teams but again I don't think they're in desperate need of sponsorship or money. Even the lower tier teams of the LCS, teams like Team Coast and XDG appear to have at least 4 sponsorships already.
Sponsoring an up &amp; coming team of amateurs would be such a crapshoot but the potential reward if they found success would be huge. Plus you could get them to change their team name to "Satoshi Warriors" or something awesome like that.

99% sure that CoyeTipBot and CoinyeOfficial are the same guy. He's not actually a TipBot... he's just logging onto his other account and typing in the "tip bot" format.

The North American League of Legends scene revolves entirely around Riot's (LoL developers) LCS. It's essentially the pro circuit, where the top 8 teams battle it out each week through the season. The viewership for these weekly matches are insane, 150k-200k people watching it for your average weekly match. The Starcraft numbers in comparison are tiny. Even the biggest Starcraft tournaments that only happen once every few months average around 60k viewers, maybe peaking to 100k. The Season 3 LoL World finals saw a peak viewership of 8.5 million. Numbers aside though, the SC2 community is very dedicated and passionate about their game and would love to see some life injected into their game with Bitcoin. But I cannot imagine the impact of sponsoring a SC2 team or player would come anywhere near that of a (successful) League team.
The amateur scene of LoL (non LCS) is very cut throat. All teams are vying for that top 8 position and a spot in the LCS. Amateur teams are formed and disbanded regularly... it would take serious scouting and dedication to find an amateur team worthy of sponsorship. These are mostly college students, forgoing their studies trying to make or break it in the harsh world of Esports. Some of the smaller teams of the LCS (XDG, Coast) would almost certainly accept a sponsorship... but at the same time some of these teams are also at risk of losing their spot in the LCS and in doing so might very likely disband altogether. It's happened to a lot of the weaker teams, like Marn and Velocity. They squeeked into the LCS and once they lost their spot they immediately disbanded their team and gaming houses.

If he is Satoshi then I'm kind of disappointed because he's a bit of a sanctimonious prick, isn't he?

I was just thinking the other day if we would ever see an ESPORTS prize of bitcoins, and here we are! These are pretty much the only two foreigners who are able to compete with the Koreans in SC2 these days and this will no doubt draw a huge amount of viewers. Totalbiscuit does so much for the Starcraft scene...

Ah wow, that button would be awesome lol.

Canadian pizza driver here - I gotta chime in. I make minimum wage, 50 cents a delivery and get to keep all the tips. The hours are also very flexible and it's one of the most relaxing jobs I've had.
Delivering pizzas is honestly awesome - the only downside is that it ruins your car.

Last night CBC radio had an interview with the guy that lost $7 million worth of bitcoins in a landfill too. 
He mined them in a week with his laptop.

This story made me so happy for some reason, lol. 
Good for you.

Ha, you know I'm kind of tempted to do something like that now... I don't have a name tag but I could like paste it to my debit machine satchel or something.

So you've just got to pray that the other guy goes through with the deal? I like the idea but... well, at least with there are flairs and stats that can show a trader's history.

Guys I deliver pizza... and I am announcing that you can now tip me in bitcoins when I deliver your pizza.
