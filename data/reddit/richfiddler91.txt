Japan's Virtual Currency Act does not make bitcoin or any cryptocurrency a "legal tender". The act simply defined bitcoin as a form of payment, but not a "legally-recognized currency".

Trade using paxful.com

I am betting it will be the same tomorrow, and the day after.
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:08:06
It's the main reason why people are moving out of localbitcoin and transferring to paxful and bisq. Their customer service is the worst when compared to others.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:26:32
Paxful allows Visa/Mastercard trade as well.

I hope you'd be able to employ proper educators as well. I once met an african college student who doesn't know how to add or subtract negative numbers. I'm not sure if it's because they don't use those mathematical concepts on their daily lives so they don't give too much importance to it, but I believe that they would still benefit knowing those stuff.

I also thought it was because of the anime tweet.

How would you know if the guy is the real and primary owner of the localbitcoins and paxful account? What if the LBC and PAX account he presented to you was bought and is being used to scam people?

You don't actually need a credit card just to buy bitcoins. The most common is actually buying using fiat money thru bank transfer to exchanges. Another is through P2P trading such as paxful. You can trade with paxful traders for 300+ payment methods including Bank Transfer, Paypal Transfer, and even Gift Cards.
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:56:30
I heard there are people making a living doing these.
@_date: 2018-10-04 08:42:24
both take the same time for confirmation. I could say that bitcoin is more useful and accepted by more people compared to bitcoin cash. You can trade bitcoins to P2P trading platforms like paxful and/or localcoinswap and more .. there are also some P2P trading platform that allows BCH trades, but mostly of them are mainly for BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-08 10:01:13
Paxful is a relatively safe place to do peer-to-peer bitcoin trading. Not because there are no scammers, but because their customer support is responsive and trade moderators are really good with their job.
I once entered into a trade chat with a phisher and reported to the support team. Moderator was swift to confirm that the link was a phishing site and immediately suspended the trader.

Google Play Credits are non-redeemable and non-transferable.
So you mostly cannot sell your google play credits for BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:39:49
I'm 100% sure trading outside the platforms is against their TOS. So the ban is justified.
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:24:40
It's nice that paxful is looking for countries their presence can provide positive impact and not focus only on places where they will profit big.

I wonder if we will ever know who/what Satoshi Nakamoto is/are.
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:19:48
bitcoins, guns, cannabis .. they're all the same. They are not "bad" as they are. It's all about how people use them.
@_date: 2018-10-31 08:05:05
cool! do you already have an up and running platform? can you have me updated as well when you're done?
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:41:23
Well, to be fair, other platforms operating the same way as paxful also have their fair share of amount of scammers. I can even hypothesize that scammers from all platforms are just the same people maximizing their reach.
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:41:07
I can vouch for paxful. I have bought some bitcoins using paypal before. Paxful Escrow will hold the bitcoins from the seller so they can't just run away from you. If the seller does not release the bitcoin immediately after you confirm your payment, you can file a dispute during the trade so the moderator can release the bitcoins for you.
Although selling bitcoins using paypal is a different and longer story. You'll have to be a little cautious as some cheaters and scammers have been using paypal to scam btc sellers in all P2P trading platforms.

The speaker's assumption is your data will be stolen for sure, no doubts, one day. His statement tho is not backed up by statistics or any proof. Yes, there are people who are making efforts to hack on the system of the institutions stated, but countermeasures are being developed to prevent this.
As to paxful's capability to protect their user's data. They did not risk on doing it theirselves that's why they hired a third-party company whose primary existence is to do KYC and verifications.
the article said:


No, it is not the essence of money laundering. Money Laundering is an act where you try to disconnect the correlation between the money and its original source, which is illegal in nature. AML measures are being implemented in order to prevent and maximize the risk of doing illegal activities.


The article you cited talks about the approval on the Finnish Parliament of a new act to govern Virtual Currency Service Providers. Localbitcoins has implemented KYC since last year.
 [ 


You can still buy or sell bitcoins from people who have posted an offer without going through kyc.


if you're actively avoiding kyc, you can still trade using other payment methods. Hence, it's not implemented to everyone. There are still ways to buy and sell bitcoin on paxful without triggering id verification. Hence your statement " Paxful has gone full KYC " is false.
@_date: 2019-04-10 08:22:37
what's wrong with KYC? Also, Localbitcoins implemented it way before paxful did. And as far as i know, they do not force everyone to go KYC unless they trade a significant amount.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:22:55
first and foremost. most platforms require you to be of legal age to trade in their platform. but who cares about that? lol
second, let's clear some things. "transfer" is different with "trading" on peer-to-peer trading platforms like paxful. Transfer means you are just sending the bitcoin from your wallet to another person's wallet for nothing in exchange. Trading is the act of actual buying and selling of bitcoins.
  
When trading, p2p platfom vendors usually apply mark-ups on their offers. If you do not agree to the mark-up of one vendor, you can always look at other vendors' offer until you find one which is acceptable for you. These mark-ups are not dictated by the platforms, but some regulate them.
It is great that you're into cryptocurrency at your young age. If you're still in paxful and want to know more about how things work there and what's new, you can check the r/paxful subreddit. If you decide to use other platforms, I advise you join their subreddits as well.

understanding private keys give you the peace of mind that nothing bad can happen.
insurance provide you the peace of mind that just in case something bad happen unexpectedly. it reinforces the concept "better safe than sorry"
@_date: 2018-11-18 16:35:49
I don't think that's what OP is trying to achieve here. I think what he wants is for everyone to be aware of this scam, and unfortunately how LBC's system allows things like this to happen.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:31:09
I was just thinking... Would mass adoption of bitcoin somehow stabilize its price?
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:30:40
it did not take me more that a minute to know the answer to your question. read the article maybe. you'll realize how stupid you comment is.
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:19:50
you can trade bitcoins for gift cards from P2P Marketplaces for bitcoin trading like [paxful.com]( 
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:10:17
you know you can also try other platforms without asking people to download anything right????
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:21:15
then what could it be?
@_date: 2018-12-03 13:05:38
wouldn't it be nice to have these everywhere? is there a way for a business establishment owner to host one of these?
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:22:05
it's either investors are exiting or people are trying to manipulate the price. How likely is it for btc price to drop as low as $1500 before the year end??
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:15:25
BISQ SHILL. you're so obvious.
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:14:35
I believe they are not to encourage or promote people to use any specific app or platform as this is r/bitcoin and not r/bisq .. just in case you don't understand how this specific subreddit works.
