"value is based on thin air"...I think he's thinking of the US dollar

Are you wanting espresso or drip? I've got a programmable Breville called "the infuser" (BES840XL) and it makes AMAZING espresso. It takes a little practice to dial in, but I love it. There's a slightly more expensive version that has a burrito grinder built in and I wish I would've gotten that one because I'm using a manual grinder currently. From what I've seen and experienced, Breville makes really nice things that won't cripple the bank

Bitcoin bought my espresso machine. Not a car, but I'm on my way!

Because laymen won't invest themselves completely in a currency where a cup of coffee is 0.0...01 coin. You are right, it doesn't make sense to sensible people, but most of the population isn't fully sensible

It means liquid physical dollars.

That's a great strategy

Until the price finally settled at a low enough price to become a viable currency for the masses, then the only hodlers that didn't lose money are the early adopters

Cash used to refer to any liquid finances, I'll agree with you there. In the modern language with such diverse technologies creating their own liquid/semi liquid finance, cash is used to describe the bill in your pocket.

Cash hasn't been King for many years

If you like to buy high and sell low, then yeah
(No, probably not a great time to buy more)

Whether you do or not, the value still changes

Moon! Moon! Moon!

Oof, right in the wallet

Buy and sell. That's the only way to get rich. (Assuming mining leads to selling)

No, too real :'(

Curious: what was the choice for the (periodic number) and (molar mass)?
