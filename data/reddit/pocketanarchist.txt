Someone decided to cash out and had presence on all the exchanges 
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:20:47
Oh you! 
@_date: 2013-10-22 01:48:11
Added as friend, I'm going to do the course someone else linked then I'll hit you up when I'm finished. Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:08:39
well that makes one of us! Thanks for the Au!

Hmm. It is negligible compared to many other fee schedules and frictionless transfers are as realistic as the friction free physics my brother teaches to grade 10s. I don't like the idea of encouraging middleman for transactions, but the necessity is understandable and the devil is in the details, are the fees truly voluntary? I'm far more comfortable with your scenario that options currently in widespread use. I'm new to all this and learning lots every day.

Awesome!

I rather spend the dollars I have that will be worth less tomorrow than the bitcoin i have that will likely be worth more tomorrow

I had been doing that, but the price fluctuations this last month are putting me into a holding pattern until things calm down. I understand it is incumbent upon us to expand the user base and promote use; it's hard to do when coin value can jump 20 bucks in a day
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:28:58
So there's that
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:02:20
Have I told you I loved you?

Cavirtex is great, but some have had to wait more days than they'd like for their deposit to be credited. You could try LocalBitcoins.com

The authors odd word choice certainly embiggened the article. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:06:14
Exactly what I'm looking for, thanks.

The whole point of bitcoin is the frictionless transfer of wealth. Why encourage rent seekers?

Holy crap I didn't know gyft was a thing
Edit: Dammit, just the states :-( 
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:25:09
You're right, just simple avarice as I watch the price rise

Bitcoin paranoid just buzzed me with 162 cad$ on bitstamp. Yay! 
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:51:17
I use cavirtex simply due to geography, in the UK I would use bitstamp. LocalBitcoins.com is also awesome and is where I started. Ensure you purchase off established vendors by reading feedback, cash and direct deposit generally get you the best prices. It will feel odd at first.

SA is still around? 
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:32:18
Grabbing popcorn, anyone else want some? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:08:50
That is a glorious idea, and would keep my frittering to a minimum 
@_date: 2013-10-03 03:58:39
What a world this would be if everyone were so ethical
@_date: 2013-10-22 15:07:56
I use my mobile to visit the exchanges... 
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:24:54
Good work! 
@_date: 2013-10-14 04:23:21
I wish instead of travelling this summer I had bought some more coin. Ah well
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:15:53
Oh ok. Perfect thread for me. You've made many comments in this thread, so I'll just ask you. I've gone through the FAQ, but I'm more a verbal thinker; I need to bounce my ideas off others to really get them. Is there a bitcoin for dummies that can get me more comfortable with the subject? 
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:07:04
Does wiki's Wikipedia intro contain the many criticisms leveled its way? [nope](
