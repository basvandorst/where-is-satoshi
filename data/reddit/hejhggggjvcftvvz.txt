Second layers are essential when we need to scale, but blocks will be expensive.

Nightly backups on the chain.
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:22:40
Bitcoin can crash hard. We do not know! 
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:07:57
Ln is useless because segwit doesnt activate til later this week!  ;)
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:09:20
It's not quite ready yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:25:49
Behave. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:24:05
It is very experimental. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:26:21
So an advesary in an off chain route can sometimes see what anyone can see (forever) on-chain? Sounds like an improvement to me, what am I missing? :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:16:24
Correct. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:22:40
Bitcoin can crash hard. We do not know!

Hail our glourios leader Roger Jong Ver!
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:19:15
This one is kinda loony, but r/btc is batshit cray cray. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:46:56
Except it doubles block capacity.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:14:07
TCP/IP didn't kill IPX, the Internet did?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:32:59
Wait a few days and bitcoin has capacity for millions of tx per sec, if we are going to be smart-asses about this. But lets not go there Lasse.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:13:40
Dude, stop this shit.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:21:02
There is a pretty big limit to Bitcoin. It scales poorly. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:13:21
Not compared to node centralization risks. No, I do not agree.
Both will have centralization pressure, scaling on-chain will be worse in my mind.
But you never know. I have been wrong in the past :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:57:20
It is not artificial if changing a parameter decreases its decentralized properties, this might sound like I'm nitpicking, but that distinction is key to understanding that argument. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:12:13
That name was picked quite late in the history of bitcoin. 
It is the smallest unit of bitcoin. 
There is no reason... 
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:34:47
Bitcoin is more often forgotten about than stolen, when it comes to the personal stash stored locally. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:24:22
Paris Hilton?
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:56:34
It matters because the truth matters, it matters because CSW patents blockchain technology, it matters because he is probably trying to defraud innocent people and heirs, it matters because he convinces powerful enough people, it matters because he is fueling the fire that has scorched the community for too long already. 
Unless we point out the obvious, he is a fraud. Do not argue with this scammer. Argue with someone else, from who CSW stole his arguments. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:38:27
That's nice that you got a warm welcome, you are very welcome here as well. Have a great day!
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:55:14
Well your knowledge is limited. All systems have scaling issues.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:53:06
Sounds like a true idiot.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:48:02
Sounds like a legal nightmare. :) Maybe it's not a realistic request?
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:57:28
How do you sell what doesnt exist? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:43:52
Sounds like a horrible place. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:36:36
You kinda have a point there, let us see if the paper agreement works out early August. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:20:08
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:52:57
I kinda agree, but I also kinda dont. I dont know!
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:29:17
Yes! We are doubling block capacity with segwit, as well as enabling ln.
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:32:40
I agree! I think PoW change is a new coin (yeah, I know there are subtleties, but what the actual fuck?!) 
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:42:11
Keynesian beauty contest 
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:20:12
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:59:49
I like Luke but I dont like this argument. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:50:41
Im sorry but pow change is a stupid short term move. For what? To prove a point? PoW algorithms are best when they are simple to implement as an ASIC. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:12:10
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:03:19
Bitcoin is game theory, cryptography, mining, transaction scripts. We can build lots of things with this, with or without the bugfix. Without your permission. :)
Sell your coins if you think ln will ruin it.

Yeah, it does bother me somewhat. Bothers me very much a lot, actually.. :(
Perhaps you can move between sidechains? Have not read up on sidechain technology enuff.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:16:05
By just increasing the blocksize, we wont reach big scale. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:52:34
Lots of core devs did develop hf code, which is what they agreed to do.
Miners have yet to activate segwit sf. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:21:58
They do work on hardforks, dynamic blocksizes, help miningpools relay blocks, privacy improvements, just about everything.
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:48:35
Where does this trade happen and how is it enforced? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:26:48
Ethereum has 10 million users?
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:19:51
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:03:30
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:18:12
Don't know. How do you sell SegWitYx bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:52:57
Incentives to join the largest pools increases with the blocksize. It also becomes increasingly harder to validate the mining work, like we have with Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:15:10
You might be mistaken here pal.
We love Bitcoin and want to keep it decentralized.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:38:11
I guess it is like antropogenic climate change, you can recognize humans have negative affect on the enviroment, yet you do not become a serial killer. 
Mining is centralized.
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:11:32
All the transactions in a block expensive? 
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:33:50
Absolute value is up, you talk market share. Absolute value is almost all-time high, you talk increase compared to a different kind of blockchain (with a smaller "marketcap").
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:37:25
You cannot strictly use logic. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:23:59
This is kinda how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:13:48
Ok, sorry for being a douche.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:54:07
How can you penalize an group of pseudonymous users unless each pseudonym admits to belonging to said group?
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:12:42
Please, no need for insults nor appeal to authority. The incentive structure is there, asics are a thing and a simple algo should be better for decentralization once moores law wears off :)
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:55:57
Complicated algorithm though. We need a simple one like Bitcoin has. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:12:39
Just like Bernanke the last time then. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:57:27
Store the signature and validate against the pruned blockchain. Did you understand what I said?
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:20:47
It has been a great strategy for people like me who are not clairvoyant. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:36:06
The sentence before that, you store your own signature and validate against the (perhaps pruned) block. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:48:42
No. You source me! 
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:46:17
Welcome back.
@_date: 2017-06-30 05:32:45
He is like a human Kitler. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 05:34:37
When? Really? That's nuts if true! 
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:34:53
I doubt it is him. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:43:28
Link to patent? Or number?
