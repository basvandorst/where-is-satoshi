The idea of stabilizing crypto by backing it with fiat is like using my pants to hodl up my belt. Literally no one could have seen this coming.
How many BTC Tether has should never be a matter of speculation. The question is whether Tether has the USD it claims. The supply and functionality of BTC are unaffected. Sounds like a problem for people holding USD or Tether to me.

I am not currently able to exhaustively research the historical usage of the word "hike" in mass media to describe the Federal Reserve's increase of interest rates.
It does seem ubiquitous, though, and [this]( at least confirms a rise in the use of the term "interest rate" that is correlated with a similar rise in the use of the word "hike". "Rate hike" has negligible usage by comparison but you can see that its usage in absolute terms has experienced a similar increase recently.
I wouldn't care if a single reporter chose the term, but its overwhelming usage reeks of a talking points memo.
The euphemism still has the same effect on the reader whether or not it is intentional.

1. It is not sitting at 9k. It has increased 177% in six months.
2. If you meant why doesn't it go up faster:
Partly because new supply from the block reward continues to meet demand.
Every 10 minutes (six times per hour on average) a new block is mined and its miner is rewarded 12.5 bitcoin.
    24 hours / day * 6 blocks per hour = 
    144 new bitcoin created every day
New supply will be halved regularly until it ceases.

If the Federal Reserve ever made an increase that wasn't called a "hike" that would have greater explanatory power. When *every* increase is called a hike, then it can't be to emphasize the sharpness of any single increase.
The current situation makes it seem that the dictionary is missing a definition: "An increase in the context of Federal Reserve interest rates."

That's a different question than the one you asked and the one I answered, but I'll give it a shot.
Crypto, or at least bitcoin, addresses the problem by making it impossible to spin money out of thin air. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, and that's that. Existing bitcoins are not created by some authority figure saying they ought to be, but by proof of actual computational work that is non-trivial.
It is technically possible to fork the blockchain to attempt to create value out of nothing. You see how well that's working out.

It's based on promises that are provably false.
Banks issue IOU's for *x* amount while only having *y* amount. *y* is less than *x*.
The only way for banks to keep their promise is by printing more money. Increased supply causes it to devalue, which is practically the same as not keeping their promise in the first place. "We will pay you *x* but it will purchase less than *x* when you get it."

You would need a "key"- the information needed to convert the blockchain info into an actual image file.
In the situation of warez, law enforcement / DMCA takes down the forum (or at least the forum posts) and the encrypted files become useless blobs to anyone who doesn't have the password.
In this case, law enforcement / DMCA takes down the software used to view the images in the blockchain.
Essentially, the criminals have the choice of illegally hosting the images or illegally hosting the viewer software. At some point they have to get the pictures out of the block chain, and that's the vulnerable point.

Here's a suggestion: The relevant definition is, "Having power concentrated in a single, central authority".
What you could say is the name of the single central authority that prevents you doing whatever you want with the bitcoin source code and your hardware.
Note that your inability to force *other* people to do as you would like doesn't mean that Bitcoin is "centralized" but rather the opposite. (If you could just make people run your fork, that would make *you* a central authority.)
So go ahead- if bitcoin is centralized, then point to the central authority that's forcing you to run their code on your hardware.

I'm tempted to draw an analogy to saying you like banks, but dislike the tellers, so let's just get rid of them and use a big bowl of money and the honor system. However, cryptocurrencies are unprecedented in many ways, so that analogy is probably broken on a fundamental level, however tempting it might be.
I always have to check myself when I start thinking "Bitcoin is like..." because that's probably not true.

Crypto in general and Bitcoin in particular have reduced the faith contingencies require, and promise to do so further.

I notice that you make reference to minting coins without mentioning that the dollar is no longer bound to any precious metal.
It's fashionable to claim one's taxes are collected at gunpoint, but anyone can opt out of paying taxes without even opting out of many of their benefits of paying taxes. Those with less than a certain amount of income don't have to pay taxes, and still get to enjoy sanitation, roads, etc. that taxes finance.
If you are above a certain level of wealth, that implies acceptance of the social contract by virtue of benefiting from maintained roads, a market of consumers with basic literacy (result of public schools), and other tax-funded programs.
I don't expect bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) to magically provide all the things that taxes pay for while also making taxes no longer exist. Removing the power to devalue the money that people have earned by spinning more of it out of thin air is plenty good enough for me.

When the middle men and the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities introduced by the fiat currency central banking is largely reliant upon are factored in, in terms of efficiency, bitcoin is practically a perpetual motion machine by comparison.
(Parenthetical aside: It makes me laugh that people count "it runs on electricity" as a strike against bitcoin. What do you think powers your bank account? The philosopher's stone?)

It seems just as valid to say that consumerism is so unnatural to human beings that it requires the creation of an artificial environment and constant behavioral enforcement to maintain- along with the occasional bailout to keep the leaky vessel afloat.

The line is the current price.
The bars in the background are the volume being sold. You can see that right after the price broke 7100, a ton of BTC was sold (or bought- can't have one without the other), bringing the price down.
I don't know who sold. It seems to have happened simultaneously across all exchanges (Bitfinex GDAX Bitstamp Kraken CEX.IO HitBTC itBit, at the top of that page, let you view different exchanges). This makes it seem like a lot of people sold. No way to be sure.

I can't find data that would permit an apples-to-apples comparison between bitcoin, which is still experiencing birth pangs, and the equivalent volatility of the Zambian Kwancha at its inception in 1964.
However: You act as though volatility in a currency while it keeps a roughly static mean value is the same as volatility in a currency that has an upwards trend in value.
Since most people would not hesitate to adopt a currency that is worth *more* the longer they hold it, *upward* volatility does not present an obstacle to adoption, which is what you claimed in [your original post here]( regardless of the respective absolute volatilities.
My accusation of cherry-picking referred to your picking one of the few time spans that would depict bitcoin's volatility as trending downward.

At the end, though he does tell the questioner, "You may be right", and his reply explains why it won't happen, not why it can't happen. I think Antonopoulos may be right as well.
That is, he say that a 51% attack is unlikely, as you say, because of how incentives are aligned. But rational incentives don't apply when the state is holding a gun to your head.
To me the appeal of changing the proof of work is to change the argument against a 51% attack away from "it won't happen" and toward "it can't happen".
It is possible that making the change preemptively is against the philosophy of anti-fragility, though.

You really want to run this out in a bitcoin subreddit, I can tell. Okay...
As you must know, genital mutilation, as practiced in Muslim countries, impairs the function of the genitalia. A circumcised penis, if anything, functions *better* than an uncircumcised penis (source: [Center for Disease Control](
Since I'm feeling charitable, here's some more information that you also seem to lack: The penis and clitoris are homologous structures. The *literal* equivalent of the Islamic practice of removing the clitoris would be removing the entire penis, not removing the foreskin.


That was levity. Since my self-worth and identity aren't bound up in this issue, I'm comfortable joking about it. Since you don't seem to be aware, it's impossible to have "negative seven people".


I have no idea how you sound (I imagine it being high-pitched and whiny, though), but your words and ideas are certainly those of an idiot with insecurities about what's in their pants.

Yes, seven people actually went out and got circumcised because the people decrying circumcision are so miserable. It's even more amazing when you consider that four of them were *already* circumcised and had to regrow their foreskin just for the procedure.

There should be a bitcoin wallet to raise funds to get you a "CASE IN POINT" forehead tattoo.

How much does it cost to talk out of one's ass on reddit in this economy?
I am trying to do some price discovery on your comment.

My understanding is that Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin with a proof-of-work that is designed to be resistant to specialized mining hardware, and hence more decentralized.
If I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will jump in and correct me. That will probably happen even if I'm not wrong, though- this is reddit, after all.

Which they will, when no one wants to use their centralized cryptocoin.

How much of the rising transaction cost is a true increase and how much is due to the cost being measured in dollars despite being *paid* in bitcoin?
I hear that bitcoin is increasing in value relative to the dollar, so that would account for some "price increase" even if the actual transaction fee in bitcoin remained constant.

Like when the U.S. government decide to take away the toy of alcohol?
Or are you thinking of the war on drugs the U.S. has been losing since it started?
If a government can't take booze or weed by lying and calling them poison, it won't be able to take money by lying and saying it is a weapon, either.

I like the volatility.
It gives an incentive to look past the next fiscal quarter.
Maybe people will do some good that outlives them for a change.

Knowing Apple users, it's time to sell some bitcoin at quadruple the market rate.
