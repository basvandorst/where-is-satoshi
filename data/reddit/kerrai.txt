They aren't known to anyone except the voter. Here, I'll try rephrasing:
Government collects the same info they collect for voter registration, but also a public address.
Government sends voters public address 1 votecoin.
Voter sends 1 votecoin using a Darksend procedure to his preferred candidate.
Voter knows who he voted for, Government does not know who voter voted for.
Alternatively, if the system allows (and I'm not sure if it should), Voter could choose to regular-send the votecoin rather than Darksend it. This would make the vote of his public address public info, meaning that the government and anyone else who knew the identity of the voter who owned that public address would know who it voted for.

The government receives less information than they sometimes would have now. They only know you're a registered voter, not who you voted for--mail-in votes, for instance, are less confidential than this system.
This system isn't only applicable to governments, anyway. You can use the same thing with voting shares of stock, non-profit memberships, etc.

Did you receive the coins to the address you withdrew to? "halted" is purposely a bit sensationalist, although I believe mostly accurate. A more precise way of putting it would have been to say that many recent BTC withdrawals have not actually been sent.

This is a real possibility.

You can just merge this cryptocurrency system with those to improve on both. I'm not sure precisely how to implement VAV, but it seems doable.
What is why you're skeptical? Being able to buy votes or the protocol-builder choosing anonymous or non-anonymous? If it's the former, I'd submit that it is equally (and as easily) possible in nearly every voting system. The latter is not a problem--it's a choice. One would assume we could get it right.

That wasn't my intent, to clarify. I put a disclaimer there in order to point out that I did not know if it was a real conversation. The headline is my own writing, and if you believe it is inaccurate, I apologize. 
Could you clarify what in the title you disapprove of? It seemed like you were stating in the IRC that learning that MtGox had been using automatic timed reissues instead of manual ones had helped move you from believing they were unlikely to have sustained significant losses to believing that it was possible they had lost significant funds.
Did we already know they were using timed reissues? I didn't know that--so that information alone is, to me, very important. I assumed that many others also didn't know.
EDIT: Can anyone confirm/deny the timed reissues info being known previously? Because if that's new information to the public, I believe we should've been informed of that awhile ago.

Any system like this allows for the sale of votes, regardless of that. You can just buy their coin; have them send it to you or have them send you their public and private keys. You can still make that illegal if you like, but it's definitely unpreventable.
If whoever was running the voting decided to force anonymous-voting or non-anonymous-voting, they could--just write it into the protocol.

Second important piece: they HAD decided not to fork. However, they were promoting v1.2.5.f, an alternative blockchain (non-conflicting, and therefore not a fork) that would have completely frozen the hackers assets. This had a real possibility of happening.

I recognize that they're changed from their original form. Right now though, the article says:
"Coin Report still sells “press releases” on the site but they at least use nofollow. I’m going to remove them from the list because they are at least trying."
Which makes it sound like you disapprove of this practice. If you don't, why call them out in this fashion? It makes you seem preferential.
If you do disapprove of that practice, I'm interested to know why, as to me it seems to be on-par with banner ads and so on.
The list also makes it seem as though CR is less than trustworthy as a result of this practice--being cited as probably trustworthy by the list, as opposed to trustworthy, after all.

No, but fiat banking has been around for a long time. Bitcoin has nearly 5 years under its belt. The story could develop into:

I imagine it wasn't rounded off, and that was the problem.
If you have an exchange with no fees, optimal bot coding would be to always beat the spread. You make your money through consistent, continuous volume and mostly ignore price fluctuation.
This bot just followed that, it seems to me--it did a good job, too. With no fees, it would've been making .01CNY/2BTC over a volume of ~40,000 BTC.
Another possibility is that there were actually two bots running, but one of them had a bug that caused it to accidentally be the taker if the spread was .01CNY.

I think CoinReport deserves a spot as a 'good player' on your list, and not just because I write for them (full disclosure). Hosting no-follow'ed press releases is essentially just a less obtrusive form of advertising than banner ads. It puts a product in front of customers for a fee, and gives the company paying for the space some perceived legitimacy (I assume CoinReport does work to vet the companies it uploads press releases of). If CR is vetting (or at least doing so on a beyond-cursory level) the companies involved, I don't see any issue with offering to sell that service, and I don't believe it reduces the journalistic integrity of CoinReport or its independent staff of writers for them to do so.

Eliminating voter fraud in a provable manner without revealing voter identities. Voters input their identifying info (needs to be unique per person) and a public wallet address into a program, program checks the validity of their info (the same info you need to register to vote) hashes some specific portion of their info and sends a coin tagged with their hashed info as a message to the address they submitted from a specific other public address. The sending address represents the 'meaning' of the vote; from one address for a presidential election vote, another for a particular congressional election, and so on.
Double-voting is easily prevented due to the hashed info--simply scan the blockchain and investigate whether or not a particular hash was issued already by the same vote-issuing address. If so, contact the individual whose identity has been compromised and work with them to fix the issue. They can also uncompromise their identity at the same time by issuing them a new ID
The whole process would run on a CoinJoin-like framework. The vote-issuing address sends out votecoins without concealing them (allowing anyone to check), but the actual voting process uses a Darksend procedure. As such, your individual vote is unknown (unless you wish it to be known!), and voter privacy is protected. The leaked information is simply whether or not your address moved your coins--and you could build the system to default the coins to being Darksent to an abstention address if not allocated elsewhere.
The voting procedure would be for a set of addresses to be publicized--one for each candidate, one for abstentions, and potentially even ones for organizations who offer to vote for you by proxy. You can build this all into a website or piece of software with the end user being basically unaware that they're using crypto--they just need to click bubbles to vote. Clicking the bubbles sets up a delayed-transaction that casts their vote at a precise point in time in the future. Any unallocated votes are automatically sent to the abstention address at the exact same time as the votes are actually cast.
The end result is a near-fraudless (this system combats ID theft well, but not perfectly) voting system with no need for recounts and no electoral ambiguity. You can just check candidate addresses. It also provides precise measures of voter apathy and makes third-party candidates more feasible, which are both excellent aims in creating a fairer and more transparent political system.

I think it's quite clear that the move on Bitfinex at 4 AM was manipulation designed to cause a margin call cascade. It's not hard to profit from it, just as in your example with oil, so someone did it.
It also has a side-advantage for the manipulator--clearing out a lot of selling pressure that would have occurred during a future rise. Those positions are forced closed, so their owners are not selling to collect profits later on, causing a faster (and bubblier) future rise.

I've supported Bitfinex for a long time and am glad to see that they've taken this step. I hope that moving forward they will continue to do their best to provide the public with further proof of their assets.
If you agree, that means that we should be pushing as a community for them to perform a more complete audit that checks their fiat holdings in addition to their cryptocurrency holdings in the near future.

I think they've written off the BTC from MtGox in their heads. When they get it back, many of them will hold it, likely in cold storage, I expect.
But yeah, it's price positive and price negative. Adding supply is negative, renewed faith is positive.

I added a bit to the post, but: Bitfinex stores Bitcoin on Bitstamp to route their orders through there. They ran out, and had to refill it. When it ran out, they stopped putting orders through Bitstamp. As a result, 1 large sell order prompted a cascade of margin calls, resulting in a flash crash to 100. The trading engine auto-halted to prevent further margin calls from going off and bringing the price to 0.

Yep, when I ran an online business, our website prices were the default, eBay prices were ~12% higher, Amazon prices were ~18% higher. People don't realize that merchants have margins they need to hit. If there's someone taking a cut from the seller, you are paying for it as well.

No, it's fine, you're completely welcome to be that guy--that guy plays an important role: questioning OP. Yes, I am definitely (and relatively transparently) using his AMA to promote my own AMA. I wouldn't say I did a lot of it though--just this post and one other.
I am an authority on nothing, as is everyone else when they start out. If you take a read through [my blog]( or [my book]( I hope you'll see that I'm articulate, well-informed, and capable of explaining and presenting Bitcoin well to an average audience.
That's why you should care about my AMA. Mr. Lawsky is going to post an AMA, and it is going to get a lot of questions. He is a busy guy, and as a result a lot of the questions he receives will go unanswered or be posted or thought of after he finishes his AMA. In addition, he won't be perfectly equipped to answer every question he gets asked. Mr. Lawsky is capable of and should be answering questions specifically about his views and his reasoning regarding the correct regulatory approach to Bitcoin, and perhaps about other aspects of his job. He likely won't have time to answer the more 'normal' questions--like "Why is Bitcoin useful?" or "What can Bitcoin do for me?" However, those questions will pop up in the collective Reddit consciousness quite a bit--and they'll want to ask them. As a community, we want someone who will do a good job, represent the community well, and provide solid and well-written answers to their questions. I believe I am quite capable of doing so, and if you agree with me, then I hope you are seeing my point.
I was already planning to do an AMA to promote my blog, because I'm a very young person with a cool job (trading Bitcoin and blogging), a cool past (professional world-travelling trading card game player, successful entrepreneur), and I just wrote a brief "What is Bitcoin?" e-Book. I figured that those things are pretty enticing or interesting to the average viewer, and so there might be some people who wanted to ask me questions about my experiences.
As a result, I'd be much happier killing two birds with one stone. If Mr. Lawsky is doing an AMA this week, and I expect people to have Bitcoin-related questions that he won't get to, then doing an AMA after his ends sounds like a win-win-win to me. I get more people looking at my AMA, the people with Bitcoin questions have (hopefully) a good source to ask for information, and the Bitcoin community benefits by having good answers on Reddit at a time when Bitcoin is increasingly coming into the mainstream view.
And don't worry about being that guy. Bitcoin *is* that guy to the rest of the world.

Well, Karpeles is not exactly the best PR guy I've ever seen, so there's that. In addition, the bankruptcy may have been forced--there were class action lawsuits and protesters outside his office, after all. There may be laws in Japan that required him to file bankruptcy.
They are in bankruptcy negotiations that can allow the business to survive, though. So it's not true that MtGox is guaranteed dead. He filed what is essentially Chapter 11, from my understanding--reorganization.

Physical voting locations reduce voter turnout by increasing impediments. Having to schedule a ride or use public transit or get off from work prevents some of the most impoverished members of the population from utilizing their political voice. Letting them do it simply from a computer at any point over a several month period will result in far, far more votes.
I also reject your suggestion that non-transparent systems (like privately counted ballots) are immune to intense ballot corruption, regardless of how carefully you select a staff. Moving to a pseudo-transparent system that allows each individual voter to figure out if their vote was counted correctly is far and away the best solution.

You can buy up to $3000 worth of Bitcoin at level 1 verification, which just requires you verifying your e-mail, activating 2FA, and adding a bank account. Then they just wait to give you your coins until it clears.
I have had a Coinbase account for a while, so I don't remember perfectly, but I thought you didn't need to wait to actually buy--just to receive.

What do you see as distinct between buying someones votecoin and paying them to mail you their legitimate, filled-in absentee ballot to have you submit it for them (which, apart from the paying them part, is AFAIK legal, IANAL etc.)?
I don't think it's realistically possible to prevent two individuals from conspiring to dual-confirmable voter fraud.
You do definitely have the option to make the system Darksend-capable and prevent coercion that way. I don't see how a Darksent-VAV system isn't readily workable--just layer another set of public and private keys on top that check if each transaction is anti-vote or vote, then check to see if they conformed to the rules a little later.

Coinbase has changed their referral program a few times in recent months--my recollection it has been:
1. $5 to the referrer and the referred after $100 purchase
2. $1 to the referrer on sign-up and identity confirmation
3. $5 to the referrer and the referred after sign-up and identity confirmation
4. (current) $25 to the referrer after $100 purchase
I think this most recent one is probably the worst of the bunch--not because it's bad for me (the opposite, in fact)--but because it offers no incentive for new users to get started. So I decided to change that, and offer my own special referral deal--I'll kick back $10 of the referral if people go through it and send me an e-mail.

If someone was selling or buying something legal on Silk Road, should they receive their money back? If so, then in order to have seized those funds legitimately, the US needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each users money was either intended to be used to traffic in illicit goods or was the proceeds of trafficking in illicit goods. They can't just "assume" it was because of where the money was held. That's not how our legal system works. Until they do so, the seizure will remain illegitimate--to believe otherwise would be akin to believing that seizing an entire banks funds because some number of its customers were drug dealers is legitimate.
A pretty clear example where this holds up is the example of a person who had deposited money but made no purchases. In what way can you claim that person was breaking the law?
