Holy shit, this is huge! OpenBazaar could really be the killer app that takes bitcoin mainstream and its great to finally see some decent money being poured into the project.
Im a fulltime eBay seller myself and i would do anything for a better alternative. Out of all the bitcoin startups that have been invested in, i think OpenBazaar is one of the most usefull projects we have in the works.
I cant wait to see where this goes, keep up the great work guys!
Im pretty poor from ebay constantly robbing me of all my profits :p but here is my little thank you regardless.

I was expecting a reply about it not being anonymous as well, but your both right. For most use cases the ability to send a payment without having to link your name, address or cc information will be enough for most people unless your trying to pull off some highly illegal kingpin kinda shit :p

@_date: 2015-06-14 13:47:18
It annoys me more when people are all like "How could ONE bitcoin ever be worth a lot of money?" like they think it's the equivalent of a ONE dollar coin or ONE apple. No bitch, referring to 1 bitcoin as 1 bitcoin is meaningless and your taking numbers of a "thing" too literally, it's also 1,000,000 bits or 100,000,000 satoshis or 1000 mBits or 1,000,000,000 slutbits so shut the fuck up and deal wit it.
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:15:51
Im sure in some places yes, definately.
I think overall tho the types of markets that will be first to adopt bitcoin (both merchants and customers) are areas that people want discretion and anonymity when paying for a particular good or services.
Bitcoin is a digital form of cash, so areas that currently already have a preference for cash will make use of this technology best with the added bonus of it being digital which will allow these areas to expand beyond the limitations of cash requiring to conduct business in person.
Just like we have seen with the silk road. It doesnt nessesarily need to be illegal goods either, there are plenty of areas where anonymity is preffered that are perfectly legal.

Yeah it does seem a bit obsolete what they cover in the film, althought one reason I want this to come out so bad is so I can show friends/family who know I'm interested in bitcoin but really have no idea what I'm on about. 
So I think it will still be good for showing people that don't know anything about it (and that is the majority of people I speak to)
I think waiting for it to rise again is rediculous, no one knows when or if that is going to happen, I hope it does but we don't know how long we could be waiting for that.
I just wish they would give their fans some indication of what they are doing to get this to the public, surely they arnt just sitting around doing nothing about it, so tell us!

I think business adoption is definitely going to help but each individual company is really only going to be marketing their own services.

Why? Dont you want bitcoiners opinions on those topics? Its related and this is by far the largest crytpo community on reddit.
@_date: 2015-05-25 08:22:45
Yeah thats how i usually purchase mine. But Bpay can take 1-3 business days. Sometimes i buy from localbtc if i want it instantly but theres a pretty big markup usually.
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:40:53
Yeah i know i should be using it more often. I do try to use it most of the time when i can online, im from Australia tho and we really dont have many merchants in my city. Im waiting for the day that it gets easier to buy and spend bitcoin quickly over here. I often have to wait days to purchase bitcoins so buying it back can be hard and while having to wait i run the risk of price flucutations.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:11:51
Yet we can discuss mastercards new p2p plans? The seagate thing seems pretty major it would be nice to get bitcoiners opinions. If dogecoin was getting billions invested i would expect to be able to discuss it here as well with people supporting the coin im also supporting.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:33:24
Its similar technology but centralised and premined. I personaly dont think it has a chance but i also dont know much about it. Prob due to the fact we dont seem to be able to discuss it :p 
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:32:49
To hit mainstream on a global scale a 3 billion dollar market cap is miniscule and not nearly enough for any major use of the technology. So yeah price matters
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:14:39
Haha yeah i think thats it. I used to enjoy big enough news to be able to tell my friends who arnt that into bitcoin.
Sure theres plenty of stuff going on but nothing that would grab the attention of people not interested in bitcoin.
Its a little depressing :p 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:29:24
Im definitely in. A bitcoin rally type thing would be great as well. Like the whole anon moment when everyone from behind their computers got together and realize all the likeminded people in their cities.
It would be a beautiful moment :)

I think your all missing the point entirely. Im not saying bitcoin is some miracle cure for piracy or justifying piracy im saying it has helped shift my thinking a little. Your all trying to argue that piracy is immoral when i dont even disagree with that and never said i did.
Paying someone with bitcoin feels a lot more personal then any other payment type i have ever used. For this reason it has made me actually stop and think. Oh this guy is actually trying to make a living here and now wants to be paid personally. Yeah sure ill go ahead and pay him.
Its not some miracle cure but i dont think anyone can deny that bitcoin feels a lot more personal in general, wether it change tipping people on reddit, donating to someone who created something on youtube to a donation address or paying someone in bitcoin on their website, it definately has a more personal touch to it then any other form of payment i have used in the past and makes people feel a little more connected. When i have pirated in the past i havnt stopped to think about the people behind it.
Everyone is completely missing the point of this post and turning into a moral debate on wether piracy is wrong or not, i never stated it was the right thing to do in the first place. I merely stated is the nature of bitcoin has made me feel more connected to someone when making a payment therefore actually stopping to think about what im doing while pirating.
This post started off with people agreeing with the personal connectivity bitcoin makes people feel. That is what i was going with here. Then a couple of people got out there pitchforks and began "wa wa piracy is bad your a fuckwit" and then it just spiraled into a debate and bashing me for something i never said was right in the first place.
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:17:24
Australia is probably one of the worst countries for piracy in the world. Its more of a problem of not having access to content legally which is why we all seem to do it. Im not speaking on behalf of everyone here but definately the majority of people i speak to pirate like its just a part of life.
None of us are sitting around thinking "omg yay, i love ripping people off" it has just become the norm over here after having years of rubbish access to media. We just got netflix like 2 months ago, go us. Oh but wait, netflix it is still rubbish because we cant get access to much content unless we are behind a vpn.
It has just become a social norm over here, and yeah it is a problem but when something has been going on every day for a while now then we kind of get to a point where we forget it is even illegal.
I have a lot of bitcoin, so it is not a problem of money. Its a problem with our shitty television network and late access to the latest movies/tv shows.
So in saying all that. In a country were piracy has just become a normal thing to do on a daily basis, i now feel a desire to pay for some of my content because bitcoin is the first time i have had the ability to pay a content creator directly over the internet just as if i was going to walk up to them and hand them cash. This is a good thing.
Bitcoin doesnt change the fact that our media access is shitty, but it has helped in breaking me out of a bad habbit because i WANT to pay for someones work and now i can pay them DIRECTLY. It could have a big impact over here.

You could say that, im not ashamed of what your calling me i just feel more of a desire to support an artist when i know 100% of my money is going to them. 
The same way i dont generally give to many charities, its not that i dont want to help it is more that i dont know where that money is actually going to end up. So it really depends on the charity. Bitcoin can help in this way as well in supporting people directly.
Call me an arsehole if you wish, i just rather know exactly where my money going.

@_date: 2015-08-13 14:30:22
My reasons for why i pirate are not even the point of this post. The point of this post is to show that the personal nature of bitcoin has actually made me stop and think about it and could possibly do the same for others. I never said piracy is good, the post is made specifically because i am aware that piracy is not good and i do it anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:07:49
How is it usually treated though? Say for example you make 200btc of sales in the year and stock purchases are all in fiat say around 20k. How is the 200btc counted in tax? At the value of the time of each individual sale or at the value of btc at the time of lodging your tax report?
If a business accepts multiple currencies then mostly at time of sale its converted straight away to local currency so it is treated the same. However if you holding a separate currency entirely then how does this get reported in determining your profit?

Depends on the receiver. Some places will acknowledge the transaction after a single confirmation, some 6. Your transaction can have 100's of confirmations on the block chain, it will keep being confirmed over time, what really matters is what the receiver wants to wait until it declares it as a finalized payment.

@_date: 2015-08-12 20:12:09
Its not a justification for piracy. I never said i think piracy is a good thing, i said i didnt feel guilty about it.
What im trying to point out is bitcoin has changed my thinking and helped me go from a pirater who hasnt really thought much of it to a paying customer who appreciates people's content. 
This is because now that i know i can send my money directly to someone and i just wanted to point out that i thought that was pretty powerful.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:32:48
I just feel like the bitcoin community is literally one of the only people in the world who actually have the power to get money to them so why not do something to help? Obviously not every one in greece is going to jump on and sign up. But with the help of some local btc traders etc we could get cash to these people.

Nah well my issue is that even tho i can open up two instances of electrum they both automatically open up at the same default wallet. Was hoping i could have one open up automatically with one trezor and the other open automatically with the other. But if i set up one trezor in one instance, close it and open uo the other electrum app it always still opens up the last one i used
I dont neccesarily need them both plugged in at the same time was just hoping i could set it up so each copy of electrum opens the desired trezor i want to take a peek at

Your post deserves more upvotes. This story sums up just one of the many reasons bitcoin can completely change the world.
Decentralised employment - free from discrimination or favoritism. A person may not have the "qualifications" but they may have the skills, and we are entering an age were we can find channels to be rewarded for those skills. On top of this we now also have the ability to be rewarded from a job or selling a product without the need to link our identities or have banking access - something that just was not possible before the invention of bitcoin. 
So many people in the world today have skills and talents but can go their lifetimes without ever being given the opportunity to be rewarded for those skills, whether thats because you live in an underdevloping country or not, unemployment is a problem accross the the globe.
I one day see a world where anyone can put their talents to good use and get paid for it. 
Projects like OpenBazaar are the beggining of this concept, while this is focusing more on the market of goods it still has the ability to hand out a contract for services of any kind of work. 
I dont think most people grasp the impact of these kinds of project.
Bring on decentralised employment!

Citicoin is the dumbest fuckin thing ever. 
The only way a 'banks' coin will work is if every single bank in the world band together to create seamless crossborder transactions by creating one single 'bankcoin' that the average joe cant buy into. This would never happen.
Your other option is if all the other banks decide "oh cool, citicoin lets jump on board and utilize this other currency and help Citibank make huge profits in the process"
Oh wait, banks are greedy as fuck and would never do this either and will all start trying to make their own damn coins and we'll just end up with the same lame arse finanical system with shit loads of barriers we have today but "YAY!! its now on a blockchain".
Meanwhile the smart banks will be like, "fuck it we better use bitcoin" and all the other bankcoins will go wee wee wee all the way to FAIL. Because Bitcoin is DECENTRALISED and any cunt and his dog can use it if they wish.
Citicoin will be the first of many failures.

Bitcoin is still very different from using merchant services and has a lot of requirements, more of a set up process and of course a bank account. Any artist anywhere in the world can create a page and start receiving bitcoin for their work just as if they were busking in the streets and taking cash, except on a much larger scale.
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:20:14
Lol, Where the fuck are you fools even getting the idea that i think piracy is a good thing? The whole reason i wrote this post is obviously to point out that its NOT a good thing and that bitcoin makes me feel more connected over the internet on a personal level and has made me more likely to pay for content. Your all arguing something that i agree with... calm the fuck down people.
If someone came and asked me if piracy was a good or bad, regardless of the fact that i do it anyway i would still agree that it is a bad thing. Why would i have even posted this in thr first place if i thought piracy was good?
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:38:15
Yeah.. Its better then staring at 31 bitcoins in limbo for weeks on end not knowing the result which from the sounds of it is what seems to happen to others. That would just be torture in my opinion. I would rather them just gone and done with and finally put my gambling habbit to rest. I managed to pull some back out at least from my initial 20 i sent over

Hey guys, there have been a few technical issues experienced in SatoshiDice over the last week. I first encounted an issue myself when i went to withdraw a very large portion of coins 31.17 and this withdrawal bounced setting the maximum i could withdraw to 0. 
My only way i could withdraw any of my balance was to get my balance higher then this.
E.g if i did a few bets and got my balance to say 33.17 it then said i had 2btc available for withdrawal. As you can understand this tempted me to continuing making some bets in the hopes to at least recoup some of my original deposit of 20bitcoins back, however the point is my original withdrawal of 31.17 should have been broadcast to the bitcoin network in the first place and i would be sitting here very happy with myself if this was the case. 
It was a very large amount to walk away from and we have still not not heard back from SatoshiDice in nearly 3 days and they have not been seen in the forums since July 11th. No responses to emails either.
I would refrain from sending any amount there before this bug is addresses, especially if any large amounts are being considered.
Fingers crossed we get a response.

Thanks man, might just keep them with circle. Although only thing i don't like is when i make a transaction i can't seem to find the wallet address to track in on the blockchain. Not sure if this is just me, do you know if there is a way to find the public addresses for transactions? They only seem to have their own transaction id's.

Originally i was intending to keep some bitcoin and convert some to AUD but i think i may be better off converting all to AUD which would make things easier. Doesnt stop me from buying more bitcoin :D
@_date: 2015-07-28 10:15:16
Do you think coinjar would be safe to sell them?
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:38:37
Yeah i want to keep them in separate houses/places. Just dont know if i trust anyone enough to hold that power lol
@_date: 2015-07-12 08:58:54
The same reason everyone else shouts they have achieved their goals in bitcoin holdings. Not trying to show off just happy about it

I used coinjar, and they dont have an option to adjust the fee. Have had a few issues with them tonight think its time to ditch them. Cheers for the help

Look up big wins in satoshidices leaderboard my same username should be there.
@_date: 2015-07-11 10:10:17
Ended up taking an hour, thank fuck for that, was a 4btc transaction :s 
Edit- for 1 confirmation that is, luckily it was satoshi dice 
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:48:42
It could be that when i initially withdrew the 31 that it hung on the transaction screen and didn't go through properly, i don't think it gave me an error either it just hung on the loading circle for a few minutes. Maybe this caused the server to think the withdrawal went through and affected the balance on their website, however did not actually physically broadcast a transaction out?
This is what i am hoping, hopefully it works out in the end... meanwhile i will continue shitting myself

Welcome aboard, we have 4 new bitcoiners so far this year... OP's post should have been upvoted more guys.

Unfortunately all my friends are against it so far :(
Only person i have been able to get into it so far is my sister, so my friends just think we are the family of nutters.

Well if that happens then i can give 20 bitcoins away to charities :)
@_date: 2015-07-12 12:29:18
Good call, im happy for you :). I waited 6 months without buying and then i jumped on just before the rise to do the same thing, definately keeping in touch with the reddit community has its benefits. You can always feel it :)

I lost just over 6 bitcoin from my initial deposit of 20. So got nearly 14 back 
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:35:56
But is there any way to bring up my existing wallet created from mytrezor into electrum? It only gives me an option to select new wallet or restore, and then asks for the seed
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:47:03
I think bitpay may work with Australians, ill have a look into it. I guess if its all entering my bank account it will then also be picked up in xero and i can treat it the same as i would currently. Do you know if bitpay sends individual sales to bank or a combined amount at the end of the day?
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:59:01
I would say i have made at least 20-30 deposits and withdrawals over the past week and not had any issues apart from one hotwallet error on a large win that got sorted. However this is so far the largest amount i have had in there and all of a sudden this new error i have not encounted before has come up on my largest win? That just seems strange to me, and i really hope i am wrong and i will more then apologise if i am wrong and rectify my claim. 
I am merely making this post as quickly as possible so that i can protect myself in the case of being scammed as it seems odd this has only just happened when on the one occasion the largest portion of my coins so far with them are coming up with an error.
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:05:15

@_date: 2015-07-13 13:14:42
Hmm, it doesn't seem to be working with me. I'm pretty sure it used to be like that but they may have changed it. Im getting the same thing in both the webbased client and the app.
Edit: it shows the address if it is an outgoing payment, however for incoming it just says "an external account"
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:32:26
Problem is im running a business with little cashflow, selling some of it could help a lot with that in the short term, but i do beleive price will be rising soon.
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:05:20
@_date: 2015-07-18 22:57:11
Thanks. I guess my reasoning was the fact the balance was set to 0 at 31.17 anything higher then that amount i was still aloud to withdraw. So for example 32.17 in my betting balance was aloud to withdraw 1 btc. I figured my only chance of getting any of it back was to try and get as much above that amount as possible so thats what i did. From my initial deposit of 20 bitcoins i was still able to get back just under 16 btc back by doing this so at the end of the day i only lost just over 4.
Doesnt change the fact that the 31.17 should have worked in the first place, at least now i can just move on from it and not have to wait around hoping they are 'maybe' lost. At least now i know they ARE lost :p and thats that
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:33:30
Aww damn i missed that, good to hear 
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:53:32
Yeah i just sent them an email.. hopefully i get a response.
















Yeah im a f**ckin idiot, i thought maybe there were different balances for different accounts, didn't realize it was a site wide thing. I thought there available funds would have been a lot larger then this being a fairly popular site. I suppose the 15 lost are my own stupid fault but i really hope i get these 10 out soon.
@_date: 2015-07-08 07:12:00
Iv had this song stuck in my head all fucken day, thanks mate

Thanks, ill take a closer look into bitpay
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:35:18
I hope so but i am very worried. Maybe the 31 i tried to withdraw before the 5 has caused an issue. Fingers crossed 
Edit: no i am just about to email them. The only reason i did this first was i was worried I wouldn't get a chance to take these screenshots in case they actually wipe the account on screen as well before i got a chance to take the screenshots. I have emailed them before with hot wallet issues and not gotten a response so i didnt not want to risk the wait. Will keep everyone updated
@_date: 2015-07-26 08:17:10

Im paranoid satoshi dice will run off with my coins or something if it's stuck there too long, or my browser will fuck up and lose the cache and i won't get back into my account.
@_date: 2015-07-18 21:55:35
I dont know what my logic was at the time.. i was distraut. I had hit withdraw nearly 25 times over a few hours to see if it got throuh, i was sending emails and making posts on the forum and getting responses that i may never hear back from them. I dont know what the fuck went through my mind at that stage but i just took one more look it and just set my bet to 10 btc and clicked the button a bunch of times until it was gone. 
I just just thought they were gone anyway and there was nothing to lose that i hadnt lost already..
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:25:59
Where have you heard it being overly profitable? Its mainly large companies now who are profiting the most, it is still possible for you to make a profit but you would definately need an ASIC.
Its good fun to get into and definately helped me learn a lot about bitcoin but the profits were very minimal, then again im in australia and our electricity prices are rediculous.
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:19:01
I really wouldnt bother on any computer, even with a high end $10,000 alienware pc you would get next to nothing.
You will need to look into ASICS, depending on your country's electricity prices though it could easily end up being unprofitable.

I know that you definately have to be carefull how you go about it. But just hitting like will often show up on friends feeds, so you dont actually have to share it. There shouldnt be anything onnoxious about you simply hitting 'like' on something your interested in. Sharing is a bit different tho, i rarely do that 
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:09:01
Im not saying thats what bitcoin needs, i beleive it will happen eventually either way. It was just an idea to help speed the process, why not do what we can?
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:57:32
I dont even have a bitcointalk account at all. I just stalk it :p 
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:17:54
What if we raised the money ourselves and sent it on to him to do it? Do you think he would be interested?
Iv seen a few TED talks on bitcoin, they arn't bad but i think Andreas is one of the best speakers we have in the bitcoin community and definately has more of an ability to get everyday people excited about bitcoin over a lot of other speakers, the other talks are interesting but not overly exciting.
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:06:01
If you like something it often shows up on friends news feeds. Thats all i have been doing is hitting the like button. I think i would annoy people too much if i shared everything :p

I was so excited about this documentary before it came out, i did enjoy it but looking back now i think it was way too "OMG BITCOIN IS AMAZING" without giving much reason as to why it is a good thing and just followed a bunch of dudes companies who got rich of it.
Not exactly the greatest thing for bitcoin i dont think, the morgan spurlock episode was prob one of the best so far. It asked alot more questions and was still quite positive.
I look forward to more feature length documentaries, im sure there will be better ones to come out in the following years.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:14:38

@_date: 2015-03-15 13:45:59
I dont think so at all, theres also half a million members over at bitcointalk, i would say about half of serious bitcoin users might subscribe to reddit or bitcointalk.
So i would say we are close to 1m. Then probably quite a lot who might own some bitcoin but dont really give a shit and dont bother following the space at all.
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:38:16
I don't think implementing bitcoin in this way would stop the clueless well-paid guy from paying his subscription though.

Exciting, congrats :) I myself have recently just hit 10btc myself, my average would probably be around the $350 mark. Iv lost a little but probably saved money overall that otherwise would have spent on other things.
Im now happy with the amount i have and probaby wont continue to buy more (maybe ;) ), im just looking forward to seeing where this awesome technology takes us.
@_date: 2015-02-09 08:19:25
Yeah fair point, i dont know exactly how the mining difficulty is calculated but if the price dropped that low would the difficulty drop back down to what it was when it was originally that low?
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:00:53
My friends dont laugh at me nor do they agree bitcoin is this amazing thing. I just try to explain the benefits and potentional of bitcoin while still explaining its not nessesarily 100 % going to take off (even though i personally beleive it will). I think this makes them more agreeable to what i have to say about it, as no one wants to hear someone rattle on saying they are correct about everything. Just let them have their own opinion, throw some knowledge in every once in a while and i think eventually people will come around.
@_date: 2015-02-25 13:04:52
That's the point I'm trying to make though i think bitcoin would give more of an incentive to pay for it for a lot of people who would not normally even think about paying for it. I personally would much rather pay a small amount to be able to go on a well designed website with categories, thumbnails and previews etc, pay $0.50-$1 to then download it rather then download some random porno off pirate bay. It's convenience for a price, just like iTunes is convenient. I used to pirate all my music, now i just pay for it in Itunes because it's easier to get individual songs then torrents. If i want an entire album i would probably go pirate bay.
@_date: 2015-02-09 09:00:20
I just think the price is reaching its bottom, when companies like cex.io are pulling services due to low price / low profits isnt that an indication of what will continue to happen with an even lower price. Just because it was less then a dollar one stage doesnt mean it will survive if it hits that again, it was still only being introduced so of course it had to start somewhere. 
After a new technlogy has gained massive media coverage, adoption and new investors jumping on board the last thing you want is for a major price drop and decline in mining. I just dont think it would be good for bitcoin.
Im not dissing bitcoin, i invested 5 grand into it recently, i did that because beleive it has massive potential and i want to see it suceed and beleive it still will. I have no intention of pulling my money out if it ever begins to drop that low, i just dont think it can happen and survive. Bring on the downvotes but a new technology that ends up being an eventual success should continue to increase in popularity and rise, not go completely  backwards to where it first began.
@_date: 2015-02-25 11:44:19
I don't really mean implementing this on streaming sites though but rather the actual producer's sites like brazzers.com. They don't actually have any advertising on their website, their membership fees range from $10 a month (for 12 months) to $30 a month for complete access to all HD content.
I'm sure the people who want complete access who are already willing to pay those subscriptions wouldn't even bother with purchasing individual videos but i think it would get more of the 'tight arse' porn users to start paying (like myself :P ).
For 50c a video via bitcoin, if you were a daily porn user that could work out to be about $15 a month your paying them instead of going on a free streaming site.
I'm sure they generate a f* load of income through their subscriptions but i think most people would just stream their lower quality / cut down clips on a site like pornhub rather then pay brazzer's monthly. So the streaming sites are the ones making ad revenue (I'm sure they pass this on to some of these big production sites though)
I think people wanting to pirate the videos would more likely pay for a month or get a 1-3 day trial and just rip the entire sites content.
I don't know, just an idea i guess. I just think something like this would turn me into a paying customer as opposed to a non paying customer which i currently am.

Arnt a lot of miners already pulling out because of the latest price drop? I think if it drops much bellow $100 its dead, i hope that doesnt happen but i dont think bitcoin can survive that much of a loss in value.
