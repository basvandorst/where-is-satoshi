At this rate.. $1000 lol. But I don't truely believe that, Bitcoin has potential. I don't want it to spike crazy high just to correct, I hope we can see it reach 20k at least and stay steady around there. It would be nice for a stable, yet higher, price so that people investing can make a buck and then have it stick around as a more stable currency so it's practical to use it. I've never used my shift card even though I'd love to, just because it's so volatile.

I've never heard of hacks on Bitcoin or any coin, can you throw a link or two this way? I'd be interested in reading more
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:33:02
Nobody truely knows. If you believe Bitcoin will be successful, buy. I think of it similar to stocks, even though it is not a stock. If you invest in currency, it should be because you truely believe in the principles of the coin you are buying, and you think it will be successful. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:41:09
We just need some nice 10k swings every few hours to really get the blood moving
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:40:46
I was up 200% because I bought at 7k... Not more than I could lose either but man losing those sweet sweet profits hurts like a mf
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:33:14
So... People that thought they were going to get rich in 4 days?
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:34:12
That's what your dad said, boy did he regret it

I agree, I don't think Whales on this market would let it go that low. But can we really expect another 10x gain in a year? It isn't sustainable to keep going up 10x every year forver, right? Because once it goes up that high, why wouldn't tons of whales sell because they made 10x profit, and call it a day? Then when it drops, people get scared, and sell, and it drops more. Like right now. Then whales come back and buy again at a crazy good price to them. I can't see it just going up and up and up, it has to stop somewhere I would think. Just my two cents
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:00
Exactly. Abandon ship? That mentality just hurts everyone more

Tell me now, how the heck did you screenshot that?! It blocks screenshots for me :(
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:15:46
The fact that Bitcoin could actually die this fast is unbelievable. It was fun while it lasted guys...
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:36:29
I'm on mobile right now and won't have a chance to check later, but this is very interesting. Are these all credible sources? I'd love to have a good reason to believe it's gonna be even 100k, much less 400k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:58:24
You don't need to know, just buy. Everyday just buy $1 in random currencies, you might get lucky. Mabey you'll get a free movie ticket out of it. Or a snack at the theaters if you really make out
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:47:35
Idk if making a bank is really worth it though. I mean that's kind of the point of Bitcoin, to get rid of the need for banks. Sorry man but your killing my Bitcoin vibe. I'll take the Rover and some phat ass though
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:59:37
nah I appreciate you guys. Daily was a great idea, its the quantity of people that ruin it. Its like reading YouTube comments, 90% of the people commenting just don't know enough for their own good regarding bitcoin. Not that i'm some expert, but I dont try to act like I know anything either. Mentor Monday is much better IMO, generally speaking. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:43:35
I failed at saving multiple times. But having something similar to stocks that was so easy to use was awsome to me. The potential for growth and the principles of Bitcoin drew me in, and my desire to save for my future has kept me here. 19 years old and I do my best to put my excess income into Bitcoin instead of blowing it on fast food. Bitcoin is my means of saving my extra cash, and I hope others do the same. Once all the kinks are worked out, and all the price stabilized and all the coins are mined, I hope to see this as a true universal currency everyone accepts. Until then, I'll hold and hope for a price increase as others hop on board. It's a great community and the potential is there. Let's see what happens

This is hilarious. Thank you lol

Well it's defined by how much he thinks it will go up. Whatever he wants the answer will be correct!

@_date: 2018-02-09 01:15:00
Woah I didn't hear anything about that. Can you point me to some more info on this? I know what Robin hood is but how can we tell how many people will be buying in? Or is that just a good guess based off the high interest shown in Robinhood?
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:01:26
Valetines day*
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:02:51
So your enforcing the dip? I mean I know we don't make a big difference but buying keeps the price up
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:59:16
Eventually maybe. I hope not soon, that's not sustainable, but hodl for the long term just in case, ya know?
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:06:25
Agreed... I hate going on here but I do anyway. Then I leave disappointed. This daily talk is horribly toxic. I just come on hoping for that xxxtra rare comment that actually contains useful information, and usually find one after sifting through a few hundred.

More determined by when I decide to buy or sell than anything I think. When I sell, the market usually skyrockets.

For the pics tho

It did have a pretty good spike though while Bitcoin was crashing. One of the few coins in the green last week
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:50:34
Lemme just taste that sweet sweet $10 coin price that once was... Then beam me up Scotty, to the moon!
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:22:45
Wait why did nobody say this to me
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:07:38
You sir, are the prophet of prophets. Learn me your ways, as I only know how to buy high sell low. How do I break free of this curse?
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:08:54
Nah, if it comes as fast as I do we are all screwed. But even Bitcoin has more endurance that a one pump chump like me

You can buy it with drugs on the dark web, no verification needed!!

I mean, people can root for whatever they won't. It won't make it happen lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:55:53
Ah, yes, wise sir. Your price prediction is well backed, and I will follow your advice random redditor /s

Golds price is manipulated by the media!! Oils price is manipulated by the media!! Everything is bud. Other factors play in as well. But of course people's opinions would effect the success of a company or project. What did you expect?
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:12:37
I invested in a fishtank for this reason. I bought a Dory fish and she has been teaching me whale for longer than I wish to disclose. Some say movies like finding Nemo are just for kids. Well when I'm a BTC millionaire, I'll attest otherwise. The whale plans I have deciphered from her teachings have done nothing but aid in my inevitable riches.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:00:56
Nah, wait and buy at 18k. Don't you know the principle? Buy high, sell low, like the rest of us! (JK I bought at 6k in November or whatever)
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:31:50
Same here friend. The lows suck and are scary, but when it rises it really feels worth the hodl
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:56:03
I mean... Bitcoin isn't exactly easy to understand when you get down to the technical aspects of it. I wouldn't expect a short report to be a perfect ELI5. It is a bit hard to understand, yes, seeing as the subject matter is hard to understand when you get into the details that OP got into. However, for the short report that it is I think you did a pretty good job OP. Good luck! I don't have much critical advice on what to change, sorry, just thought I'd support what I thought was a pretty good summary.
