What? Yes they do if they make over $x amount.
Do most minors have jobs that put them over $x? Well, no.
Regardless you still pay it then it gets refunded back to you.

or being needlessly divisive is stupid regardless of race creed or sex.
All it does is perpetuate the us vs them mentality of people that feel strongly about it one way or another, does nothing to bridge gap's, offer explanation(s), make reasonable assumptions create new channels of communication.
Not everyone is interested in discourse on the subject, most are stuck on their side of the fence and not interested in conversing further.

what if I just withdraw enough to buy a drink instead? 
you come off as one of the nut jobs screaming about the government being after them for exposing them when in reality your neighbor is just trying to give you a heads up about your malfunctioning tail light. 
All of those things are done already in a much larger way with other types of funds, why is this one special

what is this segwit thing and why is everybody mad. 
is it still feasible to mine bitcoin, if I go out and buy 100 s9's? 
where do they "come from" with mining?

cheers :)

I was looking for the gpu's off Newegg, where it took me awhile to actually think of 'amd' Then adding 470 which gave me what I was looking for. I assume it would be same thing if I was looking for 1070's etc. or models numbers I'm not sure I could search past it. 
and sure I'm happy to help ya out.

two things will, awareness and adoption. 
If I were to start using bitcoin and the seller didn't take btc, when I was out without buying anything is what will spur adoption. 
I don't see what that has to do with your original point, though.

I mean, I agree that you could spend that money on those things. 
we also can probably agree that the currency is in its infancy, further than that it's the first of its kind. 
I'm just saying, it's a pointless discussion to have. 
now that there is atms for bitcoin specifically its finally in public eyes. the gap will continue to close and it will hopefully one day completely eliminate my reliance on a bank. 
Maybe not bitcoin, but it will be at the very least the father of whatever breaks them.

I immediately used your site to search for a 470, in fairness I got an error- didn't read it and almost closed the website. 
but from reading other comments you support Newegg, thought that was weird so I searched 480, this time I read the error- it's not a word? 
I'd recommend you fix that, also as someone that doesn't use usd (and considering the website, I suspect people want to pay in btc) doesn't it make more sense to display the price in btc (maybe usd in brackets?) 
the thing with a search engine is your kind of trying to guess ahead of the user and a lot of it is challenging especially if you haven't worked in it before, but it's almost just as much about behavior. I too caught myself almost giving up searching for a gpu before I figured I'd give it another try.

Hmm I thought that's how it worked the "12.5 lottery". then if you mine as part of a pool you share it. 
I do have a ton of reading still to do, and long before I piut any significant money into it. 
Thanks so much for your in depth answer, it's getting late here so I may bug you a bit tomorrow! 
Thanks again
