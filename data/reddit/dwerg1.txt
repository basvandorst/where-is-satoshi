It will never be pure hub and spoke. I'd also guess that it won't take many incidents of a massive hub failing and affecting many people before common practice is changed. People will try using large hubs, but if they're inconvenienced a couple of times by it they'll spread out and make a more interconnected network.
I think it will evolve just fine and it will adapt into a very robust network.

By losing value. If Bitcoin becomes widely distributed and used by most people for most things, then dollars will lose value. During a transition period as more and more people use bitcoin, then bitcoin will take over the value of fiat currencies. The fiat currency becoming more and more obsolete will be used to pay off the loans that created them.
Basically loans will be incredibly cheap to pay off as a bitcoin reach astronomic values in relation to fiat, this has already happened to many of the current early bitcoin hodlers. For fiat to be "sucked up" this cycle just has to continue until all debt is gone and fiat is so worthless we'll be throwing it at the banks.
I'm not saying it will be like this if bitcoin even does take over fiat currencies, just how I imagine it could happen.

That's one of the stronger arguments in favor of bitcoin not being a bubble, I believe this. However, the internet did not escape a bubble. I understand the fundamental difference that the dotcom bubble was about stocks, but I don't think bitcoin is immune to a similar effect.
What's worth noting is that the internet is worth a lot more than it was at the peak of that bubble. The expectations for the internet was higher than what the people could make of the technology in a short enough time. I similarly think the bitcoin price and expectations is getting ahead of what will evolve out of the technology in the time people expect.
There's several things that needs to improved about bitcoin and in time that will happen. But if that's not delivered within the expected timeframe, if the development is not fast enough then the price will adjust to match what it currently delivers. Now the price is adjusting towards what people believe it will deliver in the future, people might lose faith of it doesn't come fast enough.
I do fundamentally agree with your argument though, but it doesn't guarantee this isn't a bubble. A bubble doesn't have to mean the end of something, it may be something that happens along the way.

Ah, it may seem like it, but in fact I'm very interested in the blockchain technology. I cannot control or reasonably predict the future of bitcoin, if a crash comes there's no damn thing I can do about it, except maintain a positive outlook on life despite it. So yeah, memes lighten me up so I don't also invest emotionally and take that for a rollercoaster ride too, I've tried that before and it ain't fun.
I could invest more, but I don't find it to be wise yet. Again, anyone thinking it's a good idea to stake their current economic well being on bitcoin are idiots. It's no certainty that it won't fail. There is a stickied post about not investing more than you can afford to lose, that's a wise way to invest into anything.
Anyone saying they're not into it for a quick buck are lying. Sure some are in it ONLY for that, but I'm not one of those. Of course I'm in it for a quick buck, but that's not the only reason.

Lending can exist without inflation, but nobody is used to the idea that zero or even negative interest can be profitable with a currency that steadily becomes more valuable. With bitcoin you can't print money, but you can divide it. It's kinda the same thing in reverse. 21 million doesn't sound like much, but you can in theory divide infinitely. The smallest amount today is 1 satoshi, but it's technically possible to divide further should there ever be a need for it. So according to math you can create infinite units by division, just like you could "print" infinite dollars by increasing the total number.
I think the main difference is that with increasing the amount of money, some authority needs to control the limit. With division the value of the currency regulates itself and an authority cannot abuse it. A unit steadily increases in value for various reasons and can be further divided to pay for less valuable things.

How would they effectively cut off funds? You explain that one, because I can't see how they could prevent thousands of individuals from donating to WikiLeaks.
Hubs themselves are semi central, but taking down a hub doesn't take down the network. There won't be one central hub that could be taken down to kill the network. There will probably be thousands of larger and smaller hubs creating a web of channels between them. That's decentralized more than well enough to make it practically impossible for the government to do shit about it.

I'm not against governments mining bitcoin and contributing to the network with nodes. Would be great as long as many different governments are a part of it and they don't all agree to a point where they could gain a majority of hashing power.

Back a few weeks ago when I started my adventure the first thing that hit my face was bitcoin.com and their wallet app on Google Play. I didn't know better until I sought out a bitcoin subreddit and got here. The real bitcoin community has a stronger position on reddit, it took me a few days before I found r/btc. At first I was giving their arguments the benefit of doubt, but seeing Roger Ver raging like a 4 year old and giving the finger was more than enough to stay away for good.

That argument just proves they don't understand why something has value, they don't understand that something has value because people either want or need something. That applies to everything, not just Bitcoin which has value because of the technology and especially as more businesses accept it as payment. When money can be exchanged for things and things exchanged for money, then the money has value as a universal store of value.

I have a GTX 1060. It does have a lower hashing rate than GTX 1080, but has a better power to hashrate ratio. This is because GTX 1080 uses a type of memory (GDDR5X) that's less efficient for Ethereum mining, BUT it's still profitable.
My single GTX 1060 has mined 0.025ETH in the last 7 days (that's currently $18). Your GTX 1080 will do more, but probably at a slightly higher cost of electricity. You'll still get more in return than you spend on electricity, unless it's crazy expensive where you live.
Bitcoin is pointless to GPU mine because of ASIC's being vastly superior in terms of hashrate. But there's no ASIC's for Ethereum, GPU is the best way to mine it.

If John sends 1BTC to you from a paper wallet containing 1BTC, then you'll receive 1BTC (minus transaction fees). If John now hands over the paper wallet to David, then David can of course access the paper wallet. However, prior to handing to to David, John sent the entire balance of that wallet to you, so now it's empty.
Think of it in a physical sense. John has an actual wallet with $100 in it, he then opens his wallet and hands you the $100 bill. After that John gives the wallet to David, can David then take out a $100 bill from the wallet he received from John and put in his own wallet? No, John gave David an emptied wallet, because before giving the wallet to David he gave the $100 in it to you.

I misunderstood what a 51% attack can actually do to the bitcoin network. No they can't change the rules, but it would have a negative impact in that they could effectively make it useless as long as they have a majority of the hashing power.
Your point is still valid though, but in another sense. The miners already exist with their current hashing power, but the people could fight back by running nodes and mine. If enough people do this we could have a greater combined hashing power and take the network back to a decentralized state.
It would still cause disruption, but it probably won't kill the network.

This type of heat usage is not unusual here in Norway. Except for in the middle of the summer it's cold here. There's garbage treatment plant near where I live, they burn garbage, treats the toxic gases and the excess heat is used to keep the walking street in our city ice free at all times. Some of it also goes to heat buildings. I work at another local factory, we produce some waste heat that we sell to the same network.
I mine some Ethereum at home, it's practically free. Any waste heat contributes to heating my apartment. If I didn't mine 24/7 I'd just spend that electricity on an oven anyways. Basically mining is a way to get paid for heating my apartment.
Mining is really suited for cold countries that would spend that electricity anyways. That firm will earn money in both ends, by mining bitcoin and selling the heat generated from it.

Ok, so they order people with a channel to both WikiLeaks and the VISA/PayPal hub to close their channel to WikiLeaks. Still won't matter, transactions will just be routed yet another layer out in the network. Again, they'll have to shut down their node and not be a part of the network. A few centralized nodes cannot harm the network if restricted.
You still don't understand networking. Another point is that if the US government is too restrictive then either they'll move their business to another country or more likely there will probably already be good hubs in other countries. People simply choose a node that isn't being fucked around with. Fees and transaction speed is unaffected by physical distance, you won't have to use a US node to pay US stores. It's all a part of the same global network, a small handful of nodes cannot control the millions of possible routes a transaction takes to reach the recipient.
You assume people are going to accept shit like that when it's incredibly fast, cheap and easy to change nodes. At some point the governments will realize they can't do shit to control the network and will give up shutting down nodes.
Neither the government nor an operator of a large hub has any particular leverage to pressure consumers. If they try they will just lose most of their user base in a very short time. People will move over to nodes that aren't being fucked around with. Nobody is forced to use a particular large hub and being able to reach anyone in the network doesn't depend on large hubs.

There is two kinds of people, I agree with you on that. But they'll save or use regardless of inflation or deflation. In the case of those hoarding BTC I'd imagine the result would be that as long as it's locked up in some greedy persons wallet, the rest of it in active circulation becomes worth more. So the rest of us would benefit from people living to just increase their fortune.
Sure the rich get richer just by hodling, but so does everyone else too if everyone uses BTC as a currency. At least until the hoarders start spending their money, or possibly they're passing it to a heir who is a spender. In the other case rich people may die without passing on their private keys, basically locking money forever and increasing the value of the rest of it.
Anyways, I think we have enough consumers who value physical things to keep the money circulating.

This isn't about security in the sense of securing transactions. MD5 hashes are mostly used to verify that 2 files are exactly the same, because identical files produce identical hashes. If one file file produces a different hash than another means that they're not the same.

You send $2 to Starbucks plus a tiny fee, then in their channel to McD it sends $2. So the total for Starbucks is $0 plus fees, so they basically profit from people using them to route transactions through.

Do you know much about solvents? Give me a sticker and I'll find a solvent which will make the glue as slippery as oil. The "silver shit" on a scratch ticket is different, that's not like a sticker. Holographic stickers are usually plastic with those holographic features and then some glue on that plastic film, it's then only a matter of picking a solvent that dissolves the glue and not the plastic film. If it's the scratch ticket material that's more like glue that has been printed on, it's soft and dissolving it would simply remove all of it, thus it is significantly harder to conceal tampering.
Holographic stickers are tamper resistant in that you can't just scan it and print a copy, the easy route is out of the question. However, it's not very hard to dissolve glue.

To turn your own arguments right around. Which nodes will be easier to shut down? Ones that millions of private individuals can run on their home computers or ones run by businesses who will do whatever the government says?
In lightning network you're not locking up money to make it unavailable, you're making them available. The hubs don't hold the money, they merely act as a connection between you and others.
You can open several channels and pretty cheaply IF EVERYONE STOPS TRANSACTING LIKE FUCKING IDIOTS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN!!! 
Bitcoin cash developers will likely adopt a strategy similar to lightning network, because it's fucking genius. Bitcoin core is getting the sustainable upgrades, if it needs a little extra then the blocksize can still be increased. I'm betting bitcoin cash will just rip off the hard work and get their own lightning network with zero effort.

I think the only FUD in these cases comes from the fact that eveyone thinks it has gone up more than it should have. I certainly could feel the discomfort around $20k, but I didn't sell then and I didn't sell as it rapidly went down. I pretty much know it's going back up.
I wish I sold at the high though and bought back around at 11k or something, maybe played around with the volatility some. I was at work watching the price go up and down by over $1k in short periods, I was guessing right all day. My Trezor was at home so all I could do was to watch the wonderful opportunities go by.

So, GDAX covers fees on Bitcoin transactions out of the exchange. If I then transfer it to a SegWit address and I later want to transfer it back to GDAX, I pay fees, but do I pay reduced fee transferring from SegWit wallet to a legacy wallet on GDAX?

The amount available for lending doesn't need to increase. The value of the currency increases, meaning if you lend out 1BTC with zero interest, then by the time the loan is paid back you still have 1BTC but 1BTC is worth more, so you've profited. Say a house in the future might be worth 0.01BTC, if you have 1BTC you can lend out to 100 people so they can buy a house. If there's zero interest and BTC slowly increases in value you'll still end up with 1BTC when loans are paid back, but by that time a house could be worth 0.005BTC. Then you can lend out to 200 people so they can buy a house, and on and on like that it goes.
The numbers are simplified to prove my point, I'm not suggesting the deflation would be like that in the future. Point is that you don't need to increase the amount because the same amount can be traded for more goods in the future. The advantage is that to lend out money you need to actually have the money, unlike today when they can in theory make up a number which could ruin the economy if done recklessly.
So, with bitcoin you wouldn't make more bitcoins, just divide it into smaller units as the value of it increases, to maintain its utility in buying cheap products. Everything gradually becomes worth a lower amount of bitcoins as the value of bitcoins increases. It's just the opposite of how it is today where everything becomes worth a higher amount of fiat as the value of fiat decreases.
It's math, there isn't a flaw in my reasoning. It's just how economy could work with a currency where a fixed amount increases in value. If you think about it long enough, I think you'll see what I mean.

I bought my first BTC (~$3000 worth) using GDAX. I think GDAX can be trusted enough to carry out the trade, but there's no way I'm storing my BTC there.
Regarding security measures I think properly setting up a cold storage wallet is the most important. I ordered a Trezor hardware wallet, it hasn't arrived yet so for now I'm using Electrum (software wallet). There's the option of using an air-gapped computer (never been connected to the internet), but that can be impractical for most people I think. The last option is a single-use paper wallet, but that takes a lot of precaution and ideally an air-gapped computer and printer to create in a safe manner.
The easiest and safest option is a Trezor hardware wallet. I haven't used any other exchanges yet, only GDAX so maybe others have some better insights. Just don't use Coinbase unless you like paying fees, you can get BTC on GDAX with zero fees to buy and zero fees to get it sent to your wallet.

That is true, but besides the point here. While you cannot be completely sure if 2 files are identical just because they have the same MD5 hash, you can be absolutely sure they are **not identical if their MD5 hash is not the same.**
What's pointed at here is the MD5 hash being different, thus you can be 100% certain the two APKs are not identical. You can't produce two different MD5 hashes with two identical files.
EDIT: Sorry, re-read my previous comment. I said it's used to verify if 2 files are identical, this is indeed incorrect. It's as I say here a way to be sure 2 files are not identical **if** the MD5 hash is different.

Sigh, here we go again.
I'm not defending the shit thrown in the direction of Bitcoin cash, but come on, using that name is sleazy although it's not illegal. Roger Ver is just fucked up, I can't get myself to respect that personality and all he does is throw shit at Bitcoin all day long while glorifying Bitcoin cash.
Regarding technology I don't see why we should be wasteful with digital resources. I get the whole Moore's law shit, storage and bandwidth will be better and cheaper, blah blah. But seriously, half a gigabyte blocks to reach 3000tx/s. That's over 2 ~~peta~~terabytes of information every month, that's crazy.
Bitcoin cash is a result of impatience, the easy way of increasing blocksize will always be chosen. I'm sure Bitcoin might need some blocksize increases, but that is NOT the entire solution to scaling. If we can't get other solutions to work then increasing block size is a waste, it will fail.
A rapidly growing blockchain will lead to centralization. Who the fuck will go out to continuously buy storage because of shitty resource wasting coding? Nobody. 
"Private off chain networks"... Bitch please, it's not private, it's not entirely off chain and it's not centralized. They just need to implement the lightning network already, fucking idiots all over the place spend no effort even trying to understand it. So they resort to stupid simplifications that leads to misinformation which keeps creating more idiots. Lightning network is a genius way to scale, but I have to say the current examples doesn't dumb it down enough, idiots don't understand.

The cost is slightly more than just one hop. I tried the testnet lightning network, connected to the suggested node I paid 10 satoshi transaction fee. That's so little you can't measure it in cents. I tried using a channel to a node further into the network, I paid 250 satoshi, that's 4 cents to be routed through a few more nodes.
You can do the math now. 4 cents to route your transaction through the network or 20 dollars for a one time transaction on the blockchain?
I expect the average consumer to have 1, maybe 2 channels to hubs. Only one will be needed to a single hub to reach any other hub, that's the part you don't seem to understand. You don't need to connect to every fucking hub out there to transact with people using those hubs. The hubs will carry your transaction between them for an incredibly small fee compared to doing it on the blockchain.
If you open a channel to a hub and fund it with 100 mBTC, then you can spend those 100 mBTC in hundreds of microtransactions to ANYONE in the network for a negligble amount of fees. If you do the same on-chain you'll be paying more in fees then the total amount you're sending, if it's hundreds of small transactions.

You'll notice when it's stable, when it doesn't fluctuate wildly or quickly changes value. You're right about mass adoption, I don't think it will calm down before it's distributed enough to the point where most people have some. This could take a very long time, I'm thinking years.
For now bitcoin is stuck being what it is, an asset with low utility. It can't really grow in its current condition and I'd argue it has grown too much for it is capable of now. Good thing is that it can be upgraded. The lightning network looks promising and is necessary for bitcoin to continue adoption. Next step (it will and already is overlapping) is for businesses to take bitcoin as payment. All of this will take time.
In the end though, bitcoin shouldn't be valued only relative to a dollar. It must be rooted in the actual value of products and services eventually.

I think the economy would have to adapt to the usage of Bitcoin some way. Haven't thought out exactly how it could work, but it would be very different to how it's done today.
There would be downward pressure on wages, but what you made last year is worth more instead of less this year.
This is an interesting discussion and I think this will be relevant the day bitcoin has a chance to replace fiat currency. I don't think the economy would work anything like the way it does today due to the properties of bitcoin, but I think we'll quit our pessimism and find a way for it to work. Do I have all the solutions? No. Do think solutions exists? Maybe.

Are you familiar with how networking works? If they cut off 60-90% of the channels it has no effect on the ability for anyone in the network to send money to WikiLeaks. If they cut off 99.99999% it would still be possible, even if there's a single lightning node with a single channel open to the US part of the network it will be possible. All the transactions would just be routed through that node, not only to reach WikiLeaks but anywhere else in the rest of the worldwide network.
You don't have to worry about opening a channel directly with that node. You'll already have a channel to anyone in the US network and you'll be able to reach anywhere in the world. Because your transaction will be routed through the network, from one node to the next until it passes through that single node with a channel outside the US and is further routed through nodes until you reach WikiLeaks.
Economic sanctions work because money is controlled by centralized institutions who is then controlled by a centralized government. Bitcoin and lightning network isn't an institution you can pressure into doing your bidding. Companies running nodes can be hit and major hubs can go down that way. But what do they do when those larger hubs are replaced by thousands if not millions of private individuals running their own nodes?
There isn't a damn thing any government can do to stop this except for pressuring ISP's to collectively shut down the internet or physically cut internet access between the US and the rest of the world. That in itself would also have a massive impact on the economy and any government trying it is basically digging their own graves as they revert to the dark ages.
It MUST be 100% water tight or else it's completely ineffective in stopping transactions. You'll probably see thousands of nodes with channels open across the borders, so many that no government has the resources to enforce laws against it.
You pay $20 to open a channel to ANY node in the network. Once that channel is open you can send to anyone in the network until the funded amount is spent, even if there's 100 nodes between you and the recipient. Hubs are not a weak point in the network, transactions will just find another route.
The US governments only option is shutting down internet access entirely for the entire country. It will economically ruin them. Facebook is fucked, Google is fucked, Microsoft is fucked and Silicon valley would become a post apocalyptic ghost town. Massive industries that heavily depend on the internet. They won't do this to shut down a few donations to WikiLeaks, it's too expensive and more destructive than WikiLeaks could ever be. This is the only way to stop the lightning network channels from crossing borders, it won't happen.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:34:39
Ah, but this is where we get to where you don't understand. Networking. It is very unlikely to be separate networks, you can see already today on the testnet that it's one large network where you can reach everyone in the network.
VISA can close their channel to WikiLeaks and it won't make WikiLeaks less reachable. The transaction will automatically be routed another way in the same network that VISA, freedom activists, all businesses and you operate in. If you have a connection to a VISA hub, you donate to WikiLeaks and VISA hub has a channel to both, then it's no problem. But you must understand that a VISA hub doesn't need a channel directly to WikiLeaks as long as anyone in the network does. Your payment will then just be routed through the VISA hub to any one of the potentially millions of channels connected to that hub and onto the next node that DOES have a channel to WikiLeaks. The VISA hub can NOT control payments being routed through existing channels to nodes that doesn't have that restriction.
What you're thinking is simply not technically possible. To put it another way, you don't need a direct connection to a major hub at all to pay anyone in the network. Your friend can have a channel to the VISA hub and you a channel to your friend, you'll still be able to pay anyone using lightning network.
Think of channels as roads and nodes as intersections. The VISA hub will be one large intersection. Say they close the road to WikiLeaks because government says so, what do you do? You drive through the VISA intersection to another intersection where there is a road going to WikiLeaks. If the next intersection doesn't have such a road you'll just keep driving until you find an intersection that does have a road to WikiLeaks.
So you see, shutting down a few channels in a major hub will have zero impact. It would be an intersection to thousands if not millions of other nodes, many of which will probably have a channel open to WikiLeaks.
Find a piece of paper and draw this. Draw nodes as dots and channels as lines between them. Now you probably imagine the VISA hub as a central dot with lines connecting many other dots. However the fact I think you neglect to see is that not all those people connected to the VISA node is a dead end. There won't be just a few massive hubs because it's impossible to monopolize the lightning network, anyone can participate and open channels to fucking anywhere.
It will most likely just be one major network where practically everything is reachable from everywhere. I don't know how to better explain it, but you're wrong about how you think it will work.

I'm not sure what happens if your node goes down. Or worse, if your node and the node you have a channel to both goes down. The latest state of the channel has to be stored somewhere and it's not on the blockchain, so I assume it's kept by the nodes. I also assume a channel remains open until closed. The smart way is to store the latest state of the channel on the HDD/SSD and not in RAM only. So if one or both nodes go down the channel remains open until one of the nodes requests closing it by sending the latest state.
So your node going down would in the worst case just inconvenience you if you're about to pay and power happens to go out at your home. Once it's back up it would just continue working and the channels would still be there, unless the other party tried to close it.

And in that "plenty of time" they might have gained customers at a rate they haven't been able to keep up with. Not only does it take time to train staff, it takes a portion of the current human resources. Meaning they have even less resources to deal with present problems in order to have more resources in the future, and resolve more problems.
Not a good situation for the customers in the short term (and people are understandably very impatient with money), but as more staff is trained it will be exponentially faster to train more.
What takes time and resources here isn't hiring, that's a relatively quick process. It's the training to make sure everyone does their work properly that's time consuming and resource intensive. You really want everyone to do their work properly, if not it may significantly worsen their service because all their new employees don't know what the fuck they're doing.

BTC is just BTC? Wouldn't you have to call it something else to do fractional reserve? They can't print more BTC, what they have is what they can lend out. They can't give out more BTC than the ones in circulation.
So with that in mind, who in their right mind would take a loan in BTC? It's a limited supply where some bitcoins will slowly be locked as private keys disappear for various reasons, so naturally the ones left in circulation will be more valuable with time. It could be very expensive to take a loan in BTC even with 0% interest rate. Also, with no interest who would lend BTC? It's a lot less work and risk to just keep it.
Loans work because of inflation. There is no such thing in Bitcoin (not counting the miner rewards), there is no incentive to risk lending out money. The interest would either be too high for most people to bother taking a loan or too low for anyone to bothing giving loans. It can't work.

Damn, this made me think about how loans could work with bitcoins. If you can loan bitcoins (if used as commonly as fiat is today) then interest would really screw you over as you owe an increasing value, but will probably get paid less salary as the value of bitcoins steadily increases.
Obviously that's a problem and I just read about the arguments about why deflation is bad, it mentioned that with deflation the interest could reach zero causing nobody to lend out money. But I find that to be a limited view, if money increases in value then it is profitable to lend out money with zero interest. A loan might even have negative interest for anyone to take it and still be profitable, if the money increases in value slightly faster than the negative interest eats away at the loan. It would basically be the same as it is today, except they can't recklessly print you some fresh money for a loan, just divide up the existing money and increase the value of the currency. It would also seem as a positive experience as you'd see your loan "shrinking" by itself, although this is an illusion because while the number goes down each number is worth more.
I think the reason why people find loans and deflation to be such a "problem" has an explanation in psychology and what we're already used to. Today there's inflation and positive interest to make loans profitable, that's what we're used to seeing and negative interest sounds like a dream and with an inflating currency it really is a dream. The psychology part  I think has to do with simply feeling positive towards a growing number, without considering that the larger number doesn't necessarily buy more things than the lower number in the past.
tl;dr When people say loans can't work with bitcoins, they think of how loans currently work with an inflating currency. They don't consider that there's no mathematical obstacle preventing zero or negative interest, while maintaining profitability of lending money.

@_date: 2017-12-23 04:29:25
One flaw with that thought. Nodes taking higher fees get less traffic. It's competitive, so it will never be ridiculously expensive to use and there's no technical limitation reducing the volume and driving prices up. Nodes are also forced to act nicely as there will be thousands of other nodes out there. It will act more like banks who have their hands tied behind their back, you don't need to trust the intermediary nodes. Be it banks, government, large companies or anyone else running the node, they can't do anything about the money moving through them.
People are just creating problems that doesn't exist out of thin air because a failed lightning network is in their interest. The things you mention won't practically be a problem that would make the lightning network particularly vulnerable. The network can perfectly well survive a few large nodes going down and large nodes can't abuse their channels, unless they want to lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:54
Every node would in practice reach every other node in the network, period. Direct channel to the recipient is not necessary. Direct channel to a hub is not necessary, there could in theory be 50 nodes between you and the hub and another 50 between the hub and WikiLeaks. There would probably be thousands of routes bypassing large hubs altogether. They can inform nodes directly connected to them all they want, they can shut down channels, but they will NEVER have the power to cut off a participant from the network.
Remember, there's economic incentives to make channels and route traffic on the network and anyone can do it. While it costs to open and close channels you're not addressing the fact that nodes will collect a small transaction fee for every transaction. While companies will be able to invest more money to open more channels and earn more in total, there is a limit here. They must make enough money to cover the cost of opening and closing channels, but most transactions will be automatically routed through the cheapest nodes possible. There will be strong competition, but the lowest fees will still be profitable because nobody would want to operate at a loss. What does this mean? It means that it would be profitable even to the average person to run a full node with many channels. So your assertion that only large companies will run hubs is plain wrong.
You clearly don't understand lightning network, either that or you don't understand humans.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:17:56
No. You open a channel to a lightning node, that node presumably have channels open to other nodes which again have channels to even more nodes. Your transactions to everywhere can reach through the network of channels between nodes and goes through your single channel to another node. You just need at least one channel open to a node that has channels open with several other hubs.
You can have a channel open with Starbucks and their node would probably have channels open to several other nodes. So you travel to the other side of the planet and could still pay for something there through your channel to Starbucks. Because Starbucks may be connected to a McDonald's node, all McDonald's nodes may be connected to each other and the local shop my be directly or indirectly connected to the McDonald's node.
It's a network, it behaves kinda like the internet. It gets routed through several points. But you just have one cable which it all goes through to a hub which is connected to many other points and other hubs with even more points. So everything is reachable anywhere because of interconnection.
Basically it's more like 1000 transactions to anywhere reachable from the node you opened a channel to.

I'm European and I don't have extra features. Auto buy and sell is basically what limit orders do. You set a price to sell for and when someone is willing to pay the price you set it gets sold. Opposite for limit buy orders, you can set a price below market price, go to sleep and if the market price dips down to your limit it's automatically bought at that price.
Creating a limit buy order below market price involves zero fees, if your order is above and gets immediately filled you pay fees. It's the opposite for limit sell orders.

Sigh... I'm well aware of this already happening, I'm saying it can't happen on the lightning network because it's vastly different from current centralized systems.
The hub cannot see transactions, except which channel it came from and which channel it goes to. Meaning that if you send through them, they'll see it coming from you, but they don't even know if you sent it or someone sent it through you. The same goes on the other end, they'll see what node it goes to, but they can't know if it's the end point or if it's just going through that node.
So they can't know starting points and end points of transactions. However, there is a map showing all the nodes and all the channels. So they can know which nodes connected to their hub will also eventually lead to WikiLeaks, that is one very very deep rabbit hole. Going down that rabbit hole they'll discover that they'll have to close channels until their hub is unusable in order to prevent WikiLeaks being reachable. At which point users stop using a hub that's disconnected from the network, because nobody can be reached.
Answers to numbered points:
1. Time and effort is small, there will probably be websites ranking nodes, so it would be easy to find good nodes. There's no area restriction, it will be a worldwide network, meaning you can reach everywhere from anywhere. Lightning network doesn't give a fuck about borders.
2. If your node is unusable as would be the case if it had no channels to the rest of the interconnected network, then you have the option of closing the channel or keeping your money locked up being unable to spend it anywhere.
3. If the node becomes unusable (no channels to the major network) you'll have to close it. If you have no channels you can't use the lightning network so you'll have to open another one, preferably to a node less vulnerable to destructive policies.
100% of the users of a hub will notice it if the hub closes all channels capable of reaching WikiLeaks. Why? Because it will have to be isolated from the world wide web of lightning nodes to make sure WikiLeaks is unreachable. It's like making a LAN, it's a network, but you can only reach the participants in the LAN. It will isolate the hub from the network rendering the hub unusable.
So as I said. It's not TECHNICALLY possible to have a large hub and block out any specific node in the network without disconnecting from the network and making the service unusable.
They can close down channels to nodes with direct channels to WikiLeaks, but they can't do shit if the nodes connected to the hub serves as proxies themselves, just carrying along a transaction to another node that doesn't have a direct channel to the hub but does to WikiLeaks. So they can ban nodes with channels to nodes which has a channel directly to WikiLeaks, but add another layer. This can go on and on until they realize that every node in the network can reach every other node in the network and it's impossible to operate a hub on the network with such a legal limitation.
If the US government made such a law then every large hub in the US would have to disconnect from the entire network and shut down business as nobody will use a node that's severely limited. Both consumers and businesses would have no choice but to use nodes in other countries, because US hubs are impossible to legally operate.

Even if there will be massively large hubs, the network does not depend on hubs. If lightning network becomes huge, many shops will probably run a node. They'll be connected to each other and some larger hubs maybe. Then inevitably some international company will have channels to their shops im foreign countries.
If the average comsumer is connected to 2 major hubs then the government will have to take down the entire hub. Making it close a direct channel to wikileaks is not enough, because it doesn't have to go consumer -&gt; hub -&gt; WikiLeaks. It can go consumer -&gt; grocery store -&gt; US hub -&gt; McDonald's -&gt; McDonald's in Germany -&gt; hub in China -&gt; some random dude running a node -&gt; WikiLeaks.
It could very well just skip hubs entirely. Consumers will be idiots if they open channels to massive hubs, they will learn that the moment it's taken down. It's not about hubs refusing to close channels to wikileaks, the government can't prevent WikiLeaks from being reachable at all because hubs don't need direct channels. If one hub refuses to block WikiLeaks but another doesn't, then it will just be routed from your hub to the other hub and then to WikiLeaks. Or your hub to another countries hub and then WikiLeaks.
There will probably be millions of different paths that can reach WikiLeaks, the government can't shut it down or even limit it without killing the internet.
Users will have to pay to open channels anyways. When you have used the amount you funded to the channel you'll have to close it, broadcast the total amount you've spent to the blockchain and then open a new channel. It will be a lot less than $20 if everyone used lightning network today, the reason it's so expensive now is because people barely even use SegWit and there's a lot of transactions on-chain.
Bitcoin Cash transactions would be fucking expensive too, if everyone was using it. Now it's cheap because most people stay away. The government wouldn't be able to take down the lightning network either, it would be just as hard as taking down the bitcoin or bitcoin cash network.
Any sanctions against large hubs would result in many smaller hubs and no difference to the average consumer. A network like this is extremely adaptable.

I thought about this some more, there is a flaw in my reasoning. Who would lend out money for zero or negative interest when they could just as well hold onto their money. Maybe loans won't exist at all in the future or at least be very unattractive.
Increasing the rate of inflation increases the interest rates, some people say this stimulates the market. I'd say that's partially true, nobody talks about the downside of it. It encourages debt, the money that enters the market comes from loans. With deflation people just had to save up some, let it grow in value and buy what they want.

What happens if there's a channel between two nodes and the hard drives on both nodes breaks? Who knows about the current state of the channel? Will both parties be refunded after some time? How is the closed channel broadcasted and added to the blockchain if both nodes that gives a shit about it failed simultaneously?
Does the channel just get lost and the money with it?

This misunderstanding seems to be common, but it's not how a network functions. Let's compare lightning network and the internet.
How you think lightning network will work is comparable to thinking you need an individual cable to every website you use. A cable to Reddit, a cable to Facebook, a cable to Google and every other single website you're using. This would make the internet useless.
In reality you just need 1 cable to access the entire internet. That single cable goes from your house to your ISP which just acts as a routing hub that connects you to other hubs which have a bunch of users connected to it. This makes it possible for you to reach anyone else connected to the network.
Lightning network works in a similar way, so from a user perspective, to pay someone is as simple as going to a website. On the internet you use an address to reach your target, in the lightning network you use an address to reach your target. The payment is routed through the network until it reaches it's destination, just like how information is routed back and forth between you and a website you're viewing.
You just need 1 channel to pay anyone who's part of the same network. So if you open a channel with starbucks and fund it with $30 worth of bitcoin, you would probably be able to reach the entire network through that single channel. Why? Because a business who runs a lightning node could have direct channels to customers, but will probably have channels going to the rest of the network because not everyone wants a direct channel. So would any other business and thus you can use your $30 worth of bitcoin anywhere they take lightning payment.

I bought in at $8400 and sold half around $17000 approximately 3 weeks later. Got back my investment and I'm now playing with "house money". I've not been in this for a long time at all, but the recent bottom just above $10k was entertaining. Unless it goes to 0 I have profited, so I kinda hoped it would go further down. I believe in the long term growth of Bitcoin, it's not going away anytime soon and I "know" it will go back up.
Sure, "lost" a nice amount of value compared to dollars at the bottom of that dip, but I'm sure it will be back up and go beyond soon.
I think Christmas will have a similar effect as Thanksgiving had, people get together and talk about whatever their current interests are. After that there will likely be some serious buying pressure. The time from such events seem to be 7-10 days. The new year will probably give a price boost followed by a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:39:09
You're still not grasping how difficult it will be prevent people from donating through LN to WikiLeaks etc.
If a legal limitation is put on the amount of channels then again, you'll see the network being comprised of nodes with less channels than the limitation. Such a legal limitation would ironically just further decentralize the lightning network, with more channels between nodes rather than many channels going into a few nodes (hubs).
Also, if the US government puts a limit to the amount of channels, then everyone would just make channels to non-US hubs. Sites such as WikiLeaks would then still be reachable instantly and also everyone inside and outside the US, because everyone is in the same interconnected network.
Again if any one of the nodes on US soil (likely a lot more than just one) is connected to a node outside the US, then there IS a path to route money through the lightning network to WikiLeaks. It will take the user exactly zero extra effort, because the path is AUTOMATICALLY figured out.
To be absolutely clear. People will NOT have to open a new channel at all. If you're connected to say a small hub with 4 channels, yours included. Then you can reach the other 3 connected to your hub. If one of those 3 is another small hub with let's say 5 channels, then you can also reach the other 4. Say one of those 4 has a channel to a hub in Europe that has let's say 10 channels. Then one of those 10 has a channel also going to WikiLeaks, then you'll be able to reach WikiLeaks.
In reality there will be many many different paths to take across the network. If the small hub you opened a channel with to begin with is taken down, then you'll be cut off from the entire network, not just WikiLeaks. So you'll have to stop using it or open a channel with another node. It will ONLY affect those who have a direct channel to the node being taken down, and they'll have to open another channel anyways to pay ANYONE in the lightning network. If nodes are taken down by the thousands (extremely unlikely) then you just open a channel to a node in another country where they are allowed to operate undisturbed. You will then be able to reach ANYONE in the network.
Are you beginning to understand how the US government can't do shit about it yet? They can try, but there's no chance they'll succeed and any attempt at legislation is so simple to circumvent that the end user will hardly even experience a difference. They would effectively stop 0% of the funds.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:39:51
The largest hubs would also have the most incentive to stay online. Think lost routing fees, extra miners fees for channels closing and even more miners fees to open the channels again. With hundreds, thousands or millions of channels you certainly wouldn't want the node to go offline.
Sure, they can be taken down. What's the consequence? You might be unable to reach some stores you want to pay or everything if you have only a single channel to that hub. This will last you the time it takes to find a better node to open a channel with, so the time it takes for the blockchain to confirm the new channel.
So not only would the big hubs lose on all the fees I mentioned, the people they service would rapidly stop using their node and move on to better nodes.
If large hubs become problematic then people in the network WILL adapt in such a way to eliminate or drastically reduce an issue with centralization. I think we'll see hubs, but no huge central point of failure. Probably many many smaller hubs that are interconnected, so if a few fail it will only temporarily affect a small number of people.
Bottom line is that if I ran a LN hub I would definitely want it to not go down. I don't worry about minor appearance of centralization, it will correct itself.

It's not a bubble before it has collapsed, so there's no way of knowing if it's a bubble before it's too late. It can very well stabilize at the current price or continue going up and stabilize at some other price point.
Even if it does take a huge hit I strongly believe it will persevere in the long term, so in that case I might lose on what I already invested, but be able to buy a lot more at a lower price. I believe it will come back up later anyways if it collapses now.
If this is a bubble it will pop somewhere between now and the launch of the lightning network. If it does pop it will shoot up with the announcement of the lightning network, because then Bitcoin then actually will be tremendously useful as a currency. If it doesn't pop it will either stay around the current value or continue going up until lightning network comes, then it will shoot up like crazy.
I don't really see a likely scenario where bitcoin goes down in value and just stays down indefinitely, unless someone hacks the security of the protocol (also extremely unlikely).

Good luck detecting some random words written on a note, some words underscored in a book or even better, a brain wallet. Unless you're dangling a Trezor/Ledger or have a bunch of QR codes in your luggage, they simply cannot detect digital currencies at a border crossing.
So if this became law it would impact legit users, it would still be impossible to catch a criminal/terrorist "bringing" cryptocurrencies. Because it's not something people have to physically bring, it's on the blockchain accessible through the internet, without having to carry any physical objects.
Whoever wrote that garbage doesn't even understand the basics of blockchain technology. Their best bet for catching criminals is by taking advantage of the fact that the blockchain is publicly available, tracking addresses and try to find some way to connect suspicious addresses to real people. Banning crypto and tightening money control at borders will definitely turn it into the criminals favorite currency type, it would make their control even worse.

Oh ffs, you just had to be one of those bcash shills. You have delusions about how lightning network works. There will not be any large fucking hubs and even if there are the hubs do not need a direct channel to WikiLeaks, can you just fucking understand that now??
You can have a channel to anywhere in the network and reach anyone. The hubs will most definitely have channels to someone else who has a channel to fucking anywhere.
Block size will probably need to increase, sure. But it can't increase into fucking infinity, people won't run nodes when the block size is massive and the blockchain takes 5 years to download. I know technology moves fast, but not fast enough to keep up with insanely huge blocks. The lightning network will drastically decrease that as only opening and closing a channel needs to take up space in a block, and that space is not much. You can do thousands of instant transactions between opening and closing a channel.
You don't fucking understand, you don't want to understand. This discussion is over, go research lightning network or shut the fuck up and don't talk about shit you know nothing about as if you knew.

Your question wouldn't have the outcome you think it does. If the US government says that then it will have zero actual impact. The lightning network doesn't give a fuck about national borders. If we assume everyone will obey (which they will not), then all the nodes located on US soil could shut down their direct channels to WikiLeaks, and it would still be instantly reachable. How? Say you're connected to one of these US hubs, then that hub could have a channel open to other hubs and nodes in other countries. Those hubs and nodes could then have an open channel to WikiLeaks that the US government can't do shit about. Thus you'll reach WikiLeaks anyways by routing through nodes in countries that doesn't have delusional governments.
The only way to prevent WikiLeaks from being reachable is to make everyone shut down channels going across the US borders. Effectively banning lightning network entirely. The only way to enforce this in a practical way is to shut down internet access tighter than North Korea, I don't see that happening, at least not without an entire nation of angry people wanting to see politicians heads on spikes.
In your scenario you probably wouldn't even need to switch to another hub. Your transaction will just be routed through a non-US node and reach the recipient in a few hops anyways. Your hub doesn't need a direct channel to WikiLeaks, it can take any indirect route across the entire world.
EDIT: You could also just switch to another hub, located anywhere else in the world, in less than an hour. Or even a channel directly to WikiLeaks and using their node as a point of entry to the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:09:10
You don't need to trust a larger node. It can't take your money and the larger nodes will have even more of a reason to stay online, or they'll have to pay to close all their channels and pay to re-open them. Centralization will probably happen to some extent, but LN also encourages anyone to run a LN node. Centralization also isn't a huge problem here, there won't just be one massive central hub, there will be possibly thousands of smaller hubs making up the network. I don't get what you worry about.
It would be an "expensive" transaction to open a channel, imagine the on chain traffic drastically decreasing from today's level, it won't be expensive. It's only outrageously expensive today because every single transaction is on chain, and there's a lot of them which there won't be with lightning network.
Last point, locking up money in a payment channel. This is mostly a non-issue. Most people should be on the network eventually, but if you have no choice but to pay on-chain then you can do that too, it's cheaper than opening and closing for a one time transaction. Therefore, don't lock up all your money in a lightning channel, I'd ask the idiot why he isn't connected to the lightning network though.
This is going to be great!

We might end up with such hubs. They would not be able to freeze funds indefinitely. In the case of a dispute the channel can be closed and settled on the blockchain, they cannot hold your money hostage.
Even in the case of a Visa hub, American Express hub and PayPal hub, they would be strongly incentivized to not do such things. Today it's burdening to change payment service, but with lightning network they'd lose users FAST!! The network doesn't depend on massive hubs, it can function with thousands of smaller hubs being interconnected. If a big one goes down or misbehaves you get refunded and can open a channel to a better node.
Also, take into consideration reputation. People will talk about their experiences with larger hubs, this is the internet and information spreads like a wildfire. Combined with the simplicity of just making a channel to hubs with good reputation, you'd have to be fucking stupid if you run a large hub and try to limit anyone.
So I find it extremely unlikely that anyone would attempt to mess with the system like that. Because unlike today where the payment providers can do whatever the fuck they want, they cannot if they start running lightning hubs without taking massive losses. So even if there's a few major central hubs (I doubt the network will be held together only through a few points), such centralization doesn't pose much risk at all.
While they technically could make transactions difficult for you, it would be comparable to a business just screaming "my competitor is better and it's easy to switch".
Unlike an ISP which is basically just an internet hub which is connected to other hubs, you don't need physical cables in a lightning network. Switching hubs is a lot simpler and cheaper than getting another ISP to put cables to your house. So the lightning hubs have virtually no leverage to make your life miserable.

I think bubbles are a hindsight phenomenon, you can't be sure it was a bubble before it pops.
Some say it is a bubble based on historical chart patterns on various assets, but past performances doesn't predict future performances.
Some say it's not a bubble based on a range of arguments about the properties of bitcoin. I can't deny that those arguments are stronger than those simply assuming it's the past all over again. Still, it could be a bubble though. The price of bitcoins is still rooted in the faith of a species known to change its minds.
If people collectively think that bitcoin is a great thing for the future then the price will continue surging, but if some flaw causes people to lose interest then the bubble will pop.

Bitcoin is speculative and inflexible today. It may not remain that way in the future. With a wide enough adoption I think the value of it will drastically increase before it slows down and stabilizes to a somewhat predictable rate of deflation. It probably won't grow much in value every year once it's widely used.
I think bitcoin can become a means to an end eventually, I'd imagine markets are capable adjusting price of a commodity according to supply and demand just as before. Just because a price number gets adjusted down every year instead of up, doesn't mean the actual value of it decreases, especially if the value of the currency increases. Today it's just the opposite, price numbers increase as the supply of money is inflated, it's not necessarily worth more.
But yeah, today and probably for some time, bitcoin will increase so rapidly in value it will be used as an investment vehicle, it's unrealistic to believe this rate of growth will be sustained in the long term though. It's still in it's early years, this is something untested and different from the currencies we're used to. Maybe only time will tell how bitcoin affects the world in 10 or 20 years, it's pretty hard to predict when there's no past experience to reference.

This, I think this is how bitcoin will take over as a currency. It won't happen suddenly, it will happen gradually. There is an increasing number of stores out there who accepts bitcoin. People start spending bitcoin and by immediately replacing it, no potential growth in value is lost. At the same time more dollars are pumped into bitcoins increasing it's value relative to a dollar while also spreading the currency around to more people.
The spread is important and it won't happen if everyone HODL. The money needs to move in order to be distributed, and in the case of bitcoin that means trading it for goods and services. To use a fiat currency to replace spent bitcoins is a temporary effect until people start getting wages in bitcoin. If or when we reach that point I think the currency has come full circle.

Ok, let's contrast this to how it is today. If they take down VISA today, what happens? You can't use your VISA card and there is no alternative way for you to use VISA, meaning that you need to use an entirely different solution, some of which others don't accept.
If they take down PayPal today, what happens? You can't use that option anymore, you can't pay anyone who accepts it by using that method. So maybe you use VISA, what if you don't have that? Or what if both gets taken down?
What if the handful of widely accepted centralized payment systems are pressured by government to accept absurdly strict rules that harm the market? Yeah, you can't do shit about it, we know this.
What if that handful of payment providers started running lightning nodes and the government did a similar move? People could still access the lightning network because it does not depend upon central hubs, it is decentralized even though central hubs are possible. It would happen once or twice before people learn to not use major central hubs, because they don't need to and the practical implications are nothing. The entire setup of lightning network will incentivize people to use secure and reliable nodes and stay away from vulnerable ones, such as a massive centralized node would be.
So how about those on-chain solutions then? Say the handful of centralized payment options got shut down or severely restricted, and your option is on-chain bitcoin payment, what happens? Are you going to stand in line and wait 30 minutes for your transaction to be confirmed? You can increase block size, but it's still too slow even though it's cheaper. Lightning network as the name suggests is near instantaneous, just as fast as VISA (I've tried it).
I think it's more likely that people will have a channel open to the place they shop most. Then business will have more than one channel going to several hubs, to ensure 100% uptime and safeguard against a hub going down. If it's a chain they'll probably have channels between their own nodes in addition. There will be random freedom activists running their own nodes and thus securing the uptime of the network. Even I would run a node to link up the network if lightning network became reality on the main network.
You can't have the same infrastructure on bitcoin as with USD or any other fiat currency. No government can control the bitcoin network with or without lightning network. Taking down lightning nodes will make no difference, there would still be thousand upon thousands more out there. If major hubs even come into existence and government interferes it will just be the death of major hubs, the network will continue as usual.
If you go to a store to buy something, but the "VISA" hub has been shut down, what do you do? You open a channel to any one of the thousand upon thousands of other nodes out there within 30 minutes and carry on business as usual. If the current centralized services got taken down you'd have a lot more trouble, waste a lot more time and probably pay more than the cost of opening a channel just to transport yourself to the bank. The lightning network is vastly superior to VISA and PayPal in terms of vulnerability.

My mother in law thought it was a scam and compared it to when her brother got scammed by Nigerian emails. I was speechless. I found no point trying to convince her otherwise. She doesn't believe I'll get my money back and much less does she believe I will profit.
I could sell now and have more than doubled my investment (got in at €7100), but I'm hodling longer. She'll see it's no scam when it's way too late and I've made a considerable amount of money.

That at least doesn't reflect my approach to how I'd personally handle deflation if BTC became a dominant currency. I won't stop needing or wanting things even if my money increases in value, especially if BTC became the most widely used currency I'd have to use it. It's great to know that if I'm saving up for something it won't lose value faster than I can save up due to inflation and increasing prices. There's no joy in keeping a number in an account, even if that number can buy more after some time.
If BTC is widely adopted to the point where almost everyone have some I don't think the value of BTC would increase rapidly. It increases rapidly right now as more and more people get a piece of it, but at some point I think that will slow down a lot.
Right now of course I won't use my BTC because it's increasing in value at an insane rate, and because I have an alternative that will be accepted as payment anywhere whereas BTC is not at that point, yet! But the day I can get paid for work in BTC, pay taxes with BTC, buy my food with BTC and buy my PS4 and TV's with BTC, then I will most definitely not hoard it all.
I cannot see your pessimism on the basis of how I believe people would handle their needs and wants. I can't believe most people would starve and stop wanting luxuries for a virtual number, I think money will continue moving to obtain those things. Money is worthless if I can't get something for them, money is a means to get them, it's what I can get for money that gives them value.

Sorry, I have misunderstood how a 51% attack works. They could probably still cause a lot of damage by halting transactions, effectively making the network useless for the duration they maintain superior hashing power. Like a huge DDoS attack.

The way it seems now this might be a speculative bubble, but on the other hand there's tons of people waiting to buy at a dip with faith that it will rise again and reach new heights. So in the event of a sharp price fall I think it will bounce back up pretty fast.
I'm no expert, I'm in fact very fresh to cryptocurrencies. So I might be totally wrong here, but this is what I've gathered in a weeks time.

SEPA transfer (Europe) took me less than 24 hours to transfer, from confirmed sent to arrived. It gets confirmed sent pretty quick if it's sent while bank is open. Of course weekends suck because it won't be sent until bank is open on Monday, so that takes longer. All my transactions arrived at coinbase around 8:20AM with only a few minutes variance.
I paid no ridiculous fees, transferred from coinbase to gdax with zero fees and bought bitcoin with zero fees. This was less than a week ago, pretty happy about that now.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:57:55
I'm curious, how is that estimated? By looking at bitcoins that haven't moved in ages on the blockchain or is it just an educated guess?

Nice! Next time don't keep your seeds or private keys as an image on your phone though. Any app with permission to read your media files (a lot of them) can potentially send those pictures to scammers. Safest way to handle it is to write it down on paper at home and store it somewhere safe.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:46:29
I don't have a hardware wallet, but I seriously consider getting one. It depends how uncomfortable you feel about having a small fortune exposed to potential hacking. There's no doubt that bitcoin is becoming an increasing target for hacking, if someone gets your private key and address you can wave goodbye to your bitcoins.
I know I feel very uncomfortable even if there's a small risk there's an undetectable keylogger or something on my PC. A keylogger could be all it takes to rob you, antivirus greatly reduces risks but brand new hacks may go undetected so risk is still there.
Another option is long term storage in a paper wallet, but many precautions must be taken to ensure the private key isn't exposed during creation.
Edit: You really should google bitcoin wallets, read about their strengths and weaknesses and make an informed decision.

Yeah, just make a small deposit. Once it's received by coinbase (it's added to your account so it's not lost) you can withdraw everything to your bank account. Not sure why it is this way, but I guess it might be to ensure your bank details are correct so you don't withdraw to the wrong account.
I can imagine someone withdrawing and typing their own IBAN number or something incorrectly, that would suck. But if you confirm your account by sending from it first you can't fuck it up as easily.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:15:32
Not more than you can afford losing. If anyone could reliably predict highs and lows they'd be very very rich. In reality nobody knows for sure, but it will probably go up a lot over time. Still this is a risk, something unpredictable and major that's not even known at this time could later crush bitcoin. So yeah, don't invest more than you can afford losing. If it's money that would put you in a very difficult position if you don't have it, then it's too much.
Don't get too carried away, you know how much you can afford to lose.

Does it show prices in an alert like bitcoin checker does? I find it extremely useful to just pull down the bar and update exchange rates without going into the app. The only issue I have with bitcoin checker is that the alerts often time out when I haven't checked in a while so I have to manually refresh.
If you're not sure what I mean then download bitcoin checker to have a look.

They can change the bitcoins within reasonable margins, reducing the risks. I could have found a way to do this safely, surely larger companies can figure it out too.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:40:31
If you put a limit buy order below current price you won't pay more than what you put it at. If you put a limit sell order above current price you won't get less than what you put it at. They remain until fulfilled or cancelled (unless you've chosen the other options).
What you risk is the price never dipping down to your buy limit and the price mooning while you sleep. Or if you're selling the price could crash while you sleep so you'll have to sell for even less or wait until it goes back up and reaches your sell limit.
There's risks, you're kinda betting that the price will swing your way instead of run away from your limit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:14:06
That would be what ends up happening if you had placed a buy order I think. You'd buy the 2 at 10k and the 3 at 11k which is your maximum price, so the average is the what you'd pay for each if you sum it up.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:25:03

You can use bitcoin to pay for many things, even Steam accepts bitcoin. It would help a lot if larger companies like Amazon etc. accepted it. I think it's just a matter of time though and I think the card companies think along the same lines.

Thank you for this. I'm new to bitcoin and I'm consuming large amounts of information to ensure I will secure my bitcoins when I do invest. I will go for a paper wallet generated offline, I've got good control of papers. I'm planning to hodl it for a long time.
Now I'm waiting for my bank account to be verified and I'll probably wait until the next dip.

And bitcoin is based on something that depends on no single country's economy, in the future it may depend on the global economy making it immune to any single country collapsing. That's an advantage if you ask me. Anyways, other currencies aren't less virtual, they just depend on other factors to give it value.

Some companies already takes the risk. Other companies watch them and eventually joins. I think it will go gradually as more and more learn about bitcoins and see how other companies are better off for it. The risk won't go away by nobody taking it, a business is a risk anyways and they need to continue taking some risks to grow or they'll stagnate.
Some major companies are already involved in bitcoin. It's just a matter of time. I don't expect mainstream adoption over night, but it will slowly integrate with the mainstream economy.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:38:57

Did you add a bank account and send a small amount to verify it? Might be what's missing if you bought using a debit or credit card.
Not sure how it is in the US, but here in Europe I sent bank transfer of 1€ to confirm my bank account. After that I can sell bitcoin and transfer money from coinbase/gdax to my bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:49:31
And if all companies think like you do, then nobody will adopt. Good thing is though, there's only 21 million bitcoins maximum. Some will lose their wallet so the money goes out of circulation. So inevitably there will be less bitcoin for each person, making the remaining bitcoin more valuable.
If every business was negative towards bitcoin then sure it could crash, but that's not what appears to be happening. The opposite appears to be happening. I'd love to buy stuff with bitcoin, but more companies need to accept it. If more people hold bitcoin and want to buy things with it, then it puts pressure on businesses to accept it as payment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:20:40

It took me less than 24 hours to deposit money on coinbase using SEPA transfer. So anyone to anyone on Europe, send the money in good time before your bank closes, if it's withdrawn from your account it will likely arrive early the next day on coinbase.
I made multiple deposits and they all arrived around 8:20 with only a few minutes variance.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:04:36
I have read about hodling since I bought last week. It was just about to drop below the price I bought in at, I panicked.... Luckily I keep my bitcoin in a wallet outside GDAX, the exchange crashed hard and transaction took forever. By the time my transaction was confirmed the price bounced up again, so I just lost txfees. Stupid, but less stupid than if I sold off my bitcoins.
So thank you whoever spams transactions and thanks Coinbase for crashing and having me rethink my decisions. Next time I'll just HODL.

A central bank has no use for cryptocurrencies, they have control over their coins. The entire point of cryptocurrency is to let cryptography replace the trust needed in a central bank not screwing everyone over. It makes their jobs obsolete.
