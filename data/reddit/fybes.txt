There are some great books to read too. Look through amazon and find some that have gotten good reviews. Many, many YouTube videos that describe Bitcoin and Blockchain as well.

I’m holding and not looking for the next few days. Too much drama. No way do I have the experience to try and day trade or swingtrade. I’ve got plenty of fiat in reserves and a a few good jobs and I’m in BTC and Crypto’s for the long haul. I think it’s going to be a rough several days. Your life is bigger than this. Sleep, take care of yourself, take a walk and hang out with people you love. Who you are is bigger than the money you have in play.

Emc3, and I’m ashamed of myself.

Yeah, we’ve seen these before.

I’m interested in this to the extent that btc affects the prices or health of the overall crypto market. If btc might stall or make a significant retreat, what happens to the coins (prices and future existence) that represent real, viable projects?

Probably so. I've been watching the markets for a while and there always seems to be a dip during the weekends. And from what I'm reading / researching, that dip will be greater due to the Aug. 1 date. I'm no expert, just trying to do as much DD as I can.

Is it related to volume I wonder?

I did google it. You do it and post the info...bet you get nada.

That's a good point. Didn't think of that. Don't know if the coins I'm buying are paired with either of those.
