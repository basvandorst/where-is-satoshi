how do you send zero fee transactions using the bitcoin android app or mycelium? 
@_date: 2016-08-26 14:44:26
true  with bitcoin core zero fee transactions get through (i've done many)  but it usually takes anywhere from 2-4 days to confirm, on rare occasions they luckily confirm within a few hours.  shows formula on transactions are prioritized (the real determining factor for confirmation time)  the higher the coin amount being transacted the higher the priority, the more days the coins have sat still, the higher priority.  Zero fee transactions usually are not a problem if your sending more then 1btc, less then 1 btc have fun waiting 3-4 days to confirm, but if time is not really important,  who cares

yea i found coinb.in

they both have to sync, just not all apps will tell you they are syncing in the background. all the phone cryptocurrencys apps dont store a full copy of their respective blockchains. upside: saves you from downloading 10-80GB  downside: the full copy is kept on central servers that your apps are syncing with.  Your also not allowed to send zero fee transactions as "punishment" for not keeping a full copy of the blockchain

bitmixer was never reputable in the first place.  only grams helix and payshield are reputable

yes,  when all the bitcoins are mined the miners will still get all th transactions fees in a block that they mined
@_date: 2016-09-15 00:57:47
thats why you should wait for a confirmation when buying btc in person or if your a store owner accepting via paper address, wait for a confirmation using blockchain.info   this can also be done slower using bitcoin core by sending a slow transaction (below recommended or no fee) when restarting the bitcoin core app using the --zapwallettxes=2 flag. when bitcoin core restarts; the unconfirmed transactions will not show up in your wallet but are still floating around in the bitcoin system/mempool. You then send a fast (high fee &gt; .0001btc) transaction that should confirm first, negating your original slow one
