The people who think Ulbricht should be free are really interested in all drugs being made legal.  They don't actually care about Ulbrict, at least they won't say that or admit it to themselves.  These people just want to be able to buy heroin or meth at a corner market legally. 
Saying Ulbrich is innocent because their were corrupt agents stealing money just agrees with what they want, so they push it.   Thats all.  Even though agents stealing Bitcoins from Ulbicth has nothing to do with Ulbricht being a drug trafficker. 
Ulbrich was convicted on drug trafficking charges, not attempted murder.

You don't really get that has nothing to do with Ulbrichts case do you?

Ulbircht was convicted on drug trafficking charges, not attempted murder. 
Plus, the attempt to hire the hit man was not entrapment, Ulbricht initiated the request for the kidnapping and torture, and Ulbricht bumped it up to murder all on his own, without the Force encouraging him to do so.  If Force had said something like "hey, you should kill that guy for stealing Bitcoins, want me to kill him for you?" That would be entrapment.

No he did not plead guilty to anything.  He was convicted by a jury. 
"Ulbricht was convicted of all the remaining charges after a jury trial that concluded in February 2015"

This is obviously the logical and correct answer!
Capitalism is bad so lets invent a new type of money.  That'll show capitalism.

Completing tasks for 3rd world minimum wages is a waste of time.  Working at McDonalds pays better.

His rights were not violated.   Any issue you have with Ulbrichts case and two corrupt law enforcement agents being involved has nothing to do with his civil rights or Miranda rights.  It would be court issue.

MechJeb is the way to go.  I know I can't dock to orbiting spaceships without it.

Not breaking federal law also helps.

Mechanic Turk is an Amazon site where people pay other to do insanley mind numbing tasks, mostly date entry related.  And the pay is shit, people are offering $0.01 per task completed.  
Most of the tasks is to extract data from a shopping receipt, item numbers, purchase amount, number of item. 
Example: "Given an image of a receipt extract store phone number, date, and the list of product codes and prices (get bonuses for long receipts)."   Reward $0.01  (per receipt)
Also seems to be people trying to build captcha bypass databases.  Such as "Please look at this image, outline an object, and enter the object's name."
Also "Type the text from the images, carefully. Productivity and bonuses guaranteed."
As far as I can decipher, Mandaring wants to set up the same type of website and pay in Bitcoins.
