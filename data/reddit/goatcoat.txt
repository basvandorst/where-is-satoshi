No kidding. Some people have forgotten that the true value of currency is exactly what you can get in exchange for it, and I think Steam no longer taking Bitcoin because of high transaction fees and volatility is indicative of future vendor behavior. A few people are going to get out at the right time, and most people are going to be left holding a lot of Bitcoin that they can't use to pay for goods and services and that nobody else wants to buy.

From the article, it sounds like the big problem is that they set up a mining operation using space and electricity they weren't paying for. That is kind of dumb of them.

Well, I've been informed that you can save a lot of money in transaction fees by doing what he didn't so he's not necessarily a dumbass; he just gambled and lost.

That was a serious comment. I really don't understand what the benefits are of handing over your bitcoins to someone else.

That doesn't sound so bad. What if you offer 50 cents instead? Will it just take longer to go through, or will it never go through?

How does keeping the money in the exchange avoid transaction fees?

I am completely out of the loop here. :/

How bad are the transaction fees? Is it a flat fee per transaction or proportional to the value of the transaction?

I'm not very experienced with Bitcoin, but why not keep your coins in your own wallet on your own PC unless you're buying or cashing them in?
