She will spend all the profits on perfume. And she will scream on you for losses.

I am 100% comfortable with the price movement ... from the business point of view. Meaning we need to implement financial management + long term view.

I come to the understanding.  From the layman and business point of view. I dont have to understand or read all about it.
I just need to hold at least 0.1 BTC. Lock it away. I have a life need to attend to. Even of I spent all the time read and understand about BTC. I am not helping to build the ecosystem.  I just dont want to be a watcher. By just holding 0.1 BTC, I am in the ecosystem.  That is sufficient for me. 
If you own 0.28 BTC and HODL, you can be certain no more than 1% of the current world’s population can ever own more BTC than you. A modest investment of $1,830 today can ensure you are a 1%er in a future Bitcoin world.
If I am not in the top 1%, i think i just be quiet.  I just Occasionally read about it. Don make too much noise. Don act as though I am holding tens or hundreds of BTC and make noise for attention or simpathy. Don spread FUD. Let the Eco evolves and hope to see the light in 5-10 years time. Don spend my whole life savings on BTC. Accumulate slowly over different price range and don be greedy and Gamble. Must adapt myself to the ecosystem. The Eco will not adapt to what I want. Just relax.
