Based on the convoluted Fibonacci diversion signal along with clear signs of an inverse double triangle resistance, I predict the current upwards trend is going to reverse and result in a price stabilization at $4000, with a strong linear support at $3957.259
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:54:47
It was a notification on the Coinbase app when I try to buy
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:56:25
Just waiting to release my 13k meme haha
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:30:47
How late we talkin?
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:02:42
Damn it just keeps going up, makes it tempting to  fomo buy some more haha
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:09:28
I just meant would it be smart to wait to buy for a dip, as in, is a big dip likely? Not that I was scared of one haha
@_date: 2019-06-14 14:13:09
Anyone think there will be another dip or are we just going up from here? I know no one knows, just want your educated guess ;)
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:52:10
Looks like it could hit 13k in the next few hours. Of course there’s always a chance it’ll dip back into the 11k range as well.
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:53:32
That’s no guarantee :)    Plus what if it dips hard before that?
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:59:19
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:03:40
Just smashed $12,500. Damn.
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:41:48
Any reason why it always hits 13k in increments of 69 minutes?
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:06:55
$12,600 now.....
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:40:35
Well it’s always possible to take profit and then buy even more bitcoin when it drops :)
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:04:41
I like it so far! Fees aren’t the best but it’s super convenient.
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:14:28
You think we’ll break 13 tonight sometime?
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:28:20
Yeah you’re right lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:32:03
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:15:09
Should I buy??? I’m just scared it’s gonna break 10k
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:38:55
That’s what I’m wondering, I wanted to take some profits before it probably drops a little, but idk if I should hold on a little longer
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:10:59
Do you think my account is no longer usable now? Should I get my btc off Coinbase as soon as possible?
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:03:10
Damn 13k is being difficult
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:46:24
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:10:15
Not directly
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:38:34
No problem. Also I’m sure you already know, but I wouldn’t recommend keeping btc on cash app for any long amount of time
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:26:39
Time to hop on the train?
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:26:45
Should I buy now?
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:35:25
I just used cash app and it was instant. Only thing is that in order to withdraw the btc from cash app you have to get verified which can take a few days. But you can buy right away and you don’t have to wait for that.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:51:41
 Hey don’t talk bad on Missouri!
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:16:01
And we’re gone lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:29:00
I’m glad there’s someone with some sense out here!
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:10:33
You think it would be wise to sell now and buy back after correction? I know no one knows, just wondering what you think about that move.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:08:24
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:01:48
I know, just wondering what people best guess was :)
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:22:01
$11,420 bois
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:04:38
I feel
@_date: 2019-06-15 00:27:21
Are you still of that opinion?
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:01:21
That’s a possibility
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:31:41
Made this for you guys 
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:53:38
For making trades, if you just want to hold it for a long time then you could go straight to a personal wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:24:15
Anyone think we’re getting back to 13k sometime soon?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:29:03
Think we’re at the bottom of this dip?
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:33:43
I need accuracy down to the seconds man, check your ball again
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:12:52
Get them on the stove top ASAP.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:31:53
Buy on Cash App, then transfer to Coinbase Pro if you want to trade, or just transfer directly to wallet
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:47:44
Just bought a little on this dip. Hope we blast back up now :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:24:21
Oh ya
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:45:03
It will drop somewhat at some point, but I realize it’s risky to try and time that drop
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:29:10
I just released. Let’s gooooo
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:49:14
We gonna keep going up or is there a decent correction coming soon? What’s your opinion fellow bitcoiners?
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:18:26
Will do, thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:48:33
For instant buys I use cash app, then I transfer to Coinbase Pro.
@_date: 2019-06-15 00:25:04
I feel your pain, I sold at an even worse time though lol
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:46:50
I love this lol
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:33:54
Makes sense, sounds like you have a good plan. The reason why it’s hard for me to resist trying to time the market, even though that’s risky, is because I don’t have a lot to invest. Because of that, it’s tempting to try and  invest what I can at the best moment, so when it goes up, I get the most gains possible from my small investment.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:39:29
Hmm yes that’s an idea
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:42:58
I’m depressed I didn’t buy some at the bottom.
Is it worth getting any after it just spiked up? It’s so painful to buy in now though ahhhhhh
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:51:38
But isn’t there a high chance it will dip momentarily after this big climb?
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:06:22
Wise words. Shouldn’t I wait for the weekly/monthly dip then, which will most likely occur, instead of buying now?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:54:38
Haha yeah I suppose maybe is the best any of us can say unfortunately
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:38:29
It’s not just washing over me, I’m taking a swim in it.
