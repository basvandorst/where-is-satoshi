Fun fact? That child actor is the same guy in the famous fedora tip picture.

I think this is getting needlessly messianic.

I just saw that pop up too. I was able to test them last week before I could get their verification with a buy of 0.005 BTC was told it would be in my account by this friday. By the time I got verified for instant buying, I was forbidden to buy any instantly until my first sale goes through.
So I've been anxiously awaiting Friday so I can finally instant buy and then this. So no way to instant buy and no way to fund my BTC black friday shopping spree. Disappointed.

Oh. Ok thanks. Selling all now.

To be completely honest, I would glance at my bill pile and dream for two seconds before declining those digits.

Well, they won't be charging fees, but they won't be selling any BTC either. So it's still true.

This is normal if you aren't using their instant buy. You'll be happy in a week if the price goes up.

What was their story? You made it go from one person getting in big trouble to just a person getting in some trouble and very relieved.

I'd say pulling a half million dollars off a 5k investment would be a nice jumpstart to the rest of your investing. I'm sure you thanked your friend for the tip.
