Isn't it the same with bitcoin that there is one guy who has the majority of all coins? Capitalism I guess lulz.

So Etherum has a bigger resemblance with "real" currencies in contrast to Bitcoin.

Paying taxes is not a 1 to 1 transaction, you understand that right? Taxes fund things that benefit the society as a whole. Furthermore they are used to ensure a social baseline, meaning that everyone has access to basic necessities such as health care, housing, unemployment benefits and so on. You probably live in the USA therefore I guess you can't get your head around that. Unfortunately social welfare is not something desirable in your culture.

Sorry I am new to all of this, are you talking about Bitcoin or ETH with your comment?

In the US it is much better until you get sick and fucking die because you can't afford to go to the doctor. Or they are much better for the people until you want to go to university and have to take on crippling debt because of that. Sure my friend, sure, you are right. 
By the way I live in a low tax country myself because I believe many countries in Europe go a little too far with their social welfare concept and this brings, in my personal opinion, a lot of downsides that I do not like at all. But that doesn't mean that I don't understand the benefits either. I am not saying the US is broken, but the government needs to rethink some priorities in their budgeting.
