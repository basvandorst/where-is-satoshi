Keep it.. Think long term, not short term.

Simply diversify.. Take some of your profits and put in to a 401k or IRA, have liquid assets, start some sort of flipping side job (buy/sell), etc etc.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
For everyone balls deep in crypto, I hope 100% it works out wonderfully for you.. BUT I always recommend diversifying

Best thing to do is just talk about it and how you are interested in, maybe considering investing.
Do not tell people to buy, and do not say you own any.
That’s the easiest way to avoid this crap.. Dealt with it multiple times myself.

Good for you, and I’m very happy for your success and willingness to share.
If I was donating that much, I would 100% be donating to different animal organizations...
No kill animal shelters, and organizations that are trying to save wildlife.. Black Jaguar White Tiger is one that is doing great things out of Mexico.
I’d also be giving money to boys/girls clubs, and shelters from people who have suffered from domestic violence.
Another good one is Fight for the Forgotten.. Justin Wren (an MMA fighter) is involved with this organization, they dig wells for villages in the Congo. Awesome stuff.
Once again, you rock.. Nice knowing there are decent people out there still lol
Happy holidays

I remember when BTC first started, I used to go to this website and watch them get mined, I think? It was just a white screen that had little bubbles popping up with a number inside it.
I don't remember buying any, but I always question myself.. Like maybe I did and just forgot? Lol

Isn't the stock market a 7% rate of return?
Something to think about/consider... As usd and other currencies phase out (no idea when/if this will happen), I would have to assume the ROI for BTC would increase.
Either way, and 8% ROI is great long term.

China backs their money by gold.. Russia and China trade oil in the Chinese YUAN, they’re taking a stand against the petro dollar. Which would crush the USD.
Gold is a great buy, as is bitcoin.. I don’t think it’s a this or that thing, it’s a buy both thing.

So what did you buy so I can drink the koolaid

A bank account in Coinbase is only like 1.5% and CC is 4%... While I do agree that it’s a fairly significant hit to the initial purchase, I still think it’s better than saving to get 1 big lump sum and buy all at once.
I’m sure there are people more knowledgeable than me with better options lol
These are US numbers for Coinbase btw
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:34:37
I agree with this.. If you can afford $100 per month, buy $25 worth of BTC every week.

Just make sure you’re rebuying what ya spend :)

I’ve read about a few investment people/firms saying Q2 2018 the stock market will be taking a hit, pretty significant one at that.. I would imagine that bad things happening to FIAT currency and stocks would be beneficial for crypto.
Seems like the more the world goes to shit the more valuable cryptocurrency is.
