Agree.  There is interest from EU Investment Funds, and I would say Bitcoin is being embraced here in Canada by the technology savvy investment crowd.  There are so many features missing from bitcoin like modern market making principals and some undo function (on unconfirmed transactions) that will most likely be missing until the client comes out of beta.
I have heard in design circles that "utility trumps fidelity until a product reaches commodity".  This probably makes no sense outside of my brain, but I think Bitcoin is at a point where it has incredible utility for those who are using it now, however it must increase fidelity (ability for amateur users to interact) before it can be more widely adopted.

A few years is eternity.  I agree that the level of competency required is still far above the 'normal' user.  My tech savvy 60 yr parents are probably 6 months away from having a wallet and my 70 yr old neighbors are probably a year or more away from using BTC at all.
Market making is going to be critical in the coming cycle, then we will see wide adoption of devices like Bitcoin ATMs and further incursion of merchant services.  Personal wallet technology will expand and likely be ready for 'normals' to use daily within 6 months.  That will be the 'Windows 95' era.
More exciting IMO will be the 'Windows 98/XP' era when a social contract is established for time/฿ conversion and issues like minimum wage are addressed.  That will be the tumultuous time as social conventions of government and finance will need to be rewritten.

Is there somewhere I can go to see an explanation of how money is created in Canada?
This is where I am at with it, if you have some time I would be interested to hear your thoughts:
1.Government asks the central bank to issue a bond for $1000CAD.
2.The issued bond is deposited in a chartered bank (RBC, TD, CIBC, ScotiaBank, BMO - do they also allow credit unions?)
3.Chartered bank withholds $100 (10% is a guess, I cannot seem to find an exact capital reserve number for Canadian banks) and in turn loans out the $900 as traditional loans, lines of credit, credit cards, mortgages etc.
4.The money is then redeposited in banks by the recipients of the money, the bank holds some of the money as capital reserves and the process starts over again.
My concern with a system like this one is that debt is an incentive for the banks.  Most people don't use their credit to improve economy, they buy a new TV or a more expensive home.
I know the bank does a lot, but they also charge a lot.  Not only do banks get to charge interest on the money they lend, there are also monthly service fees (which have gone up by more than 5% per year for me for the last 3 years).  Then there is merchant services where customer's payments are loaned to businesses and payment takers as short term loans with at least 3% interest (if the monthly service fee for a terminal is included the total taken off gross revenues can be as high as 18% for the smallest businesses).
I guess the old geezers in the video scare me a little bit when the central interviewee is Paul Martin, long time Canadian Business Man, Former Finance Minister(long time Cabinet Minister) and Former Prime* Minister.
Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Your questions are highly valid, in fact the answers to them are still being debated, this is what I know so far.
**So, I don't plan on using it to do anything illegal, so is there really a reason for me to invest in them?**
Legality and investment are two different questions to me.  
First Legality:  The USA has some interesting guidelines when it comes to virtual currency, I recommend doing a sub search for FinCEN if you live there.  If you are in Canada, we are pretty welcoming of Bitcoin, in fact the Royal Canadian Mint had a challenge for developers to create a virtual currency called the Mint Chip Challenge.  Of course it is important to keep records of taxable financial transactions and remit when necessary to the relevant governing body in your jurisdiction. 
Second Investment: **Only "invest" what you are willing to ~~loose~~ lose**.  Even uninsured bank deposits can be confiscated in times of peril, be aware of the limits of the investment vehicle before you start.  Think of buying Bitcoins as establishing a new trade route for yourself, just like opening a bank account for the first time, or charting new waters to buy spices.  You may not need it today, but perhaps you will in the future to send money to a friend overseas or you might want to use it the next time you travel to Berlin.  Opening and funding an account at a Bitcoin exchange took me about 6 hours here in Canada, however some people report taking 4 days to turn their dollars into Bitcoins.
Once you have coins, there are securities available to provide you some monthly, weekly and even daily return, be sure to visit for more details.
**What are some of their legitimate uses, and how many places actually accept them?**
My partner and I sell cupcakes a street market for Bitcoin, although nobody has used it this summer.  There are a number of sites you can check out and services available.  [BitCoinStore]( is a fancy computer shop.  There are lots of consultants and servers also accepting Bitcoin.  Berlin Germany seems to be a bastion of Bitcoin, and there is an open air exchange happening in New York City called Satoshi Square along with a few bars and shops.
**And if I do decide to give it a shot, what are the best ways of going about getting them?**
That is more difficult because I would need to know what region you live in.  In Canada I would recommend the VirtEx exchange (full disclosure, I am an investor), but there are many other avenues.  My first Bitcoins were obtained from mining with CPU and GPU infrastructure back in the days of 1 million difficulty - those days are long over.  Mining is not very practical for the average user right now as hardware is expensive and difficult to obtain.  The ever increasing difficulty also means that mining requires constant investment to stay viable.  I would say buying your coins from an exchange is a really great place to start.  Check to see if there is a meet up group in your local area and bring a friend.

This is an idea I have been tossing around in my head for a while, I am curious to know your opinion.
Would a mirror government be appealing to you?  Something free, open and online, perhaps even similar to Reddit where citizens could come and debate with the ability to up and down vote various policy proposals.  Of course there would need to be checks and balances and a lot of design work before it could function.  But maybe if we build it, they will change.  I see it as an open source, distributed government.
Perhaps it could start as a democratic Bitcoin authority with a voluntary donation structure that would fund and operational needs like servers and utilities.  Of course it would be small scale to start, like a model UN.  
I like to think that the world would like to change and live with more economy, there just hasn't been a model developed and demonstrated that works better than our current system.  What you said about technology being our hope for social change is spot on.

I am getting 25.37% over the VirtEx spot price this morning.  They are using the Mt.Gox API, in which case it would mean 2.6% over the CAD spot price on Gox.
The price dichotomy between VirtEx and Gox is going to be interesting in September.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:53:49
Interesting analysis MdaMan.  There seems to be a manipulation down on VTX to a bottom at ~฿0.12.  That would put the valuation of VTX at $30millionCAD with a ฿/CAD spot price of $250.
I am still mid term bullish on VTX and I will continue a strong buy down to ฿0.12.  The pivot will occur with any positive announcement from VTX or their first quarterly report (est. Q3 2013).  I see VTX as an insurance policy against a ฿ price correction (as an exchange with fees on the front end CAD VTX will profit in either ฿ direction).  
There will be a price correction on ฿.  The correction will either occur at or near $500CAD (psychological sell price for a lot of investors); or the correction will occur when miners receive their BFL ASIC Mining units and sell ฿ to cash to cover their opportunity loss from waiting for units.
FULL DISCLOSURE AND DISCLAIMER: I am not an investment professional and all information here is IMO and should not be considered unless you are willing to accept the high risk of a volatile FOREX market.  I also hold shares in all of the funds on Havelock.

Old news indeed.  There used to be a show here in Canada called "Air Farce" that called out a lot of media silliness, all be it in a very juvenile way.   It has since been replaced with "The Mercer Report" and "This Hour Has 22 Minutes", however the state owned network CBC has become much more controlled by the political leaders in the last decade through budget cuts.
Podcasts appear to be a bastion of free thinking, what is your opinion on them? Is it best to just take it all with a grain of salt?

You could include some research on other payment gateways outside of PayPay (like Moneris, Elavon, Beanstream, etc..) and how their fees compare to bitcoin (include exchange and transfer fees in your comparison).  This is also a good place to mention Ripple (I will give you 100 ripple if you want).

Is there an index for BTCT, Bitfunder and(or) Havelock to see how securities are performing in context with their host exchange?  Especially some data visual to see movement against volume.

You are right. I have been looking for ways to take bitcoins offline and trade the offline vehicle for money.

I am sure there is a back log of traffic from the nuttiness of the past 72 hours.
When I submitted my documents to become a verified user there, the process took at least a day or two.

I would give the whole process a 10/10.  The guys running the phones are not people with time to BS, have your words chosen carefully before hand and you will get very quick service.
