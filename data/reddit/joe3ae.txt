You're comparing two different things is his point. Yes you could sell twitter to somewhere else for that price but in the analogy if everyone started dumping twitter shares no way in hell would 9b come from that.

and that's the point. It's also not unique to bitcoin. It's a terrible analogy.

Since you're new to bitcoin you're not used to this while people who have been here go through this shit all the time, this is nothing new and will guaranteed happen many times over.
Too much of bitcoin is tied up by whales and traders, until more people start buying up coin and hold, like yourself, to stabilize the price it will just be a cat and mouse game of up and downs.

Not that I disagree but what about forking with blockchains is any more essential than forking any type of source code. You make it sound unique to crypto.

What makes you think that, we aren't really any higher than we were 11 days ago. Where is this new influx?

and you'll find hoards of people saying the exact same thing 2 years ago when BTC was at 200.

In the us you can freeze your equifax score I believe. Many people do this to prevent fraud or try and prevent certain lookups in order to get credit cards. May be a long shot but call them and tell them to freeze it and hope they will look for an alternate score provider.
