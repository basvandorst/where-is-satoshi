But we should all just go ahead and take *you* seriously?
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:37:41
I think the guarantee was that they'd pay dividends of up to .0035 BTC/share, which is what the IPO price was. What it meant was that you'd make back whatever you invested if you bought at that price or lower.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:58:41
So what you're saying is we shouldn't really take either of them seriously, considering neither of them are credible.
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:32:53
462 shares. Also held until the bittter end.

Bank account number and transit number is all you need for this. They never ask for the physical address of your main branch.
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:49:24
I really wanted to use VoS, but I'm not willing to provide such personal information (employer's name, address, contact details, full bank details, ...). Sounds like an identity fraud nightmare. Why can CaVirtex get away without knowing these details, but VoS needs them to be verified?
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:55:15
They definitely don't ask for employer information.  
I'm pretty sure they don't ask for bank branch name and branch address either.

Yeah, it did seem sketchy, but I went through with it anyway. They called me a day later to confirm I was real and the guy I spoke to seemed very genuine and helpful with any questions. I've since traded ~100 BTC without issues, though I do hate the fees...

Cool site. I think shorter times between races would be great, especially during times that you have a lot of visitors (if this is consistent). I also noticed I can open up the bet windows even after the race has started. Although it does stop me from betting, it might be better to disable the UI entirely once the race starts. There's also that "Still Here" timeout which seems to trigger every 5 minutes. I'm guessing that's for security?  
Also, I bet 0.01 on all 3 horses. There were no other bets. I was returned 0.02955 btc. How was that calculated?
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:16:49
I think this has at least a small connection with there now being a Litecoin-accepting SR.

I would love to be able to complain about a 0.6% fee. I pay a 3% fee both ways when trading (Canadian). I always calculate my net profit minus fees before making a trade, although for the most part, I keep on hoardin'.

Pretty douchey response to getting a BTC tip. I also hope you don't actually think it's "ironing."

Nvidia GPUs are garbage for mining, unfortunately. I'm not sure GPU Bitcoin mining is even worth it at all at this point. A lot of people have switched to Litecoin mining.
@_date: 2013-02-24 14:29:09
Exactly, and if you already own a decent video card from a gaming PC, there is basically no investment being made. I still GPU mine. It's fun seeing 0.08 BTC being added to my wallet daily, especially when the value goes up. I'm okay with ASICs being delayed.

After converting to local currency, can it be withdrawn if you're outside of the US? Is there a separate rate/fee for doing that?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:57:18
Pretty sure that's not what happened. His transfer of $35.1k already went through and the coins were technically purchased when it did, they just weren't released. Now, Coinbase is showing the value of those 40 BTC at $21.9k instead of $35.1k. So he bought them at ~$880, and they're now worth ~$550. He lost $13k.  
OP: Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:37:47
Yup, it's all sold out within 30 minutes. Insane. This isn't small pocket change we're talking about, this is people willing to spend $5000-$7000 and not see anything for it until June.

Seconding your point  I have less than 4% of my wealth in Bitcoins. I at one time had as much as 10%, but after constant stress and losing sleep at night, I pulled out sooner than a high school boy. Now, I basically forget I even have the coins, although I still keep my eye on the charts. To me, this is a long-term investment, and bubbles are expected to happen with something so innovative. I'll just keep holding.

Not that I'm suggesting OP does something illegal, but in what way could anyone track that you made capital gains from selling BTC, especially if you haven't deposited those gains into a local bank account yet?

I'm also in Toronto and constantly looking into projects involving Bitcoin. For starters, I think cavirtex's fees are pretty insane nowadays, so if you're trying to build an exchange, definitely keep that in mind. I work full time as a developer, if you need help with coding, etc., drop me a PM.

Definitely don't panic buy right now, but consider selling over the next few weeks/months. This new high will get a correction sooner or later. I sold half of mine at around 21, and don't really regret it because.. well.. where else are you going to get &gt; 100% ROI? (I bought that half at $9.50)

I run a 7970 and 2 5850s for a total of about 1.2 GH/s or $140 a month. It may not seem like much, but if my computer is at home printing money (that seems to be continuously increasing in value) while I'm at work, why do I care how little it is? It's still practically money earned for no work.
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:28:02


You're forgetting that the majority of people interested in cryptocurrencies are also techies. A lot of us have experience with computers and hardware. 


They could be saving money and building it themselves. There are hundreds of videos on both YouTube and Newegg showing you how to put a computer together. Every aspect is covered. You're targeting the portion of Bitcoin-users that do not know how to do this, and sure, to them, it probably seems better to just buy a premade rig than it is to watch about an hour of video and gain valuable experience in computer hardware WHILE saving money, right?

What a scam... The buyer won't see this product until the end of the year, IMO. Remember that Avalon chip samples were supposed to be shipped 4 weeks after chips were ordered - no one has received these sample chips yet. Also, batch 2 and 3 seem to still be shipping, so who knows how long it will be before Avalon chips are in the hands of the many people who have purchased them, let alone built into an Avalon clone.

It seems like they're in the usual "producing units, no communication" phase. They do this during every batch until the very end, then Yifu starts appearing on the boards again. I'm also waiting for a refund and what can I really do except... wait? Just take it easy for now OP, and make sure you do have a ticket open in their system as Yifu does read them AFAIK.

They're so difficult to get, aren't they? It's also pretty shady that the ship dates keep getting pushed back. A lot of folks on Bitcointalk are calling Avalon scammers, BFL less so because they post frequent updates on shipping status. I guess we'll see what happens.. and keep GPU mining until then.
