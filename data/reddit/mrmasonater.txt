I'll be sure to keep this in mind, thanks.

This was a great help, thanks heaps.

Black Market Reloaded, another Tor market.

Nope, I know some HTML and CSS but that's it, sorry.

Can we collect the bounty in Bitcoin?
Just kidding.

IMO I had never expected The Armory to do particularly well, as it was up against the market of BMR, which was already well established. BMR has far more in terms of options in stock, and is generally better priced anyway.

Thanks heaps, I'll be sure to look into this.

Thanks so much, I'll be sure to look into this.
Does the fact that I'm with SGE Credit Union make any difference?

This sounds great, one last question, is there a minimum age requirement?
I appreciate your help heaps, by the way.
@_date: 2012-09-12 07:33:14
Ah well there you go.
@_date: 2013-09-24 12:41:36
Oh right, I was too busy trusting buzzfeed with all my financial decisions that I forgot to notice bitcoin wasn't a thing anymore.
@_date: 2013-01-10 03:24:01
Nup, added it as a new wallet.

I'd wait, but I'd set myself a desired profit margin I want to achieve. Once it hits that, I sell.
If it goes higher, I've made my money, congratulations to everyone who's made more.
I like your way of thinking though, it makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2013-09-24 13:39:12
Yeah that's a fair point, but what investment isn't going to be based around even a slightly volatile market?  
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:36:17
You make a fair point, hence why I'm looking for things to influence my decision. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:10:58
Still, at prices that small, a modest investment could become worth it, however you're right. It's a huge gamble.
@_date: 2013-01-09 14:48:02
Thanks, you've been a great help. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 02:44:40
I like the way you think.
@_date: 2013-01-09 23:52:01
Yeah definitely, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the help.

I always use cash transfer over gox or any of those other sites, so I can't say I've faced the same problems
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:35:31
Yeah that's a good way of looking at it, thanks. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:05:18
Yeah that's what I'm worried about, everything could crash just like that.
I like your idea of investing spare cash though.
@_date: 2013-01-09 15:28:02
Very counter intuitive, thanks a lot.
@_date: 2013-09-24 13:18:01
I've already bought and spent, so if I did buy again, it'd be to tuck away and sell when it reaches a nice price.
What you're saying makes sense though.
@_date: 2013-09-25 02:56:12
Yeah I remember when I first got into it, I was like "holy shit $6? No way am I paying for that". 
How I regret that.
@_date: 2013-01-09 15:17:50
Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
