Cool thanks for that tip. I'll see if I can find that discount on their website.

Thanks for the advice. I'm going to transfer everything to breadwallet
I have a reoccurring purchase of $10 per week bought on Coinbase. Is there a way to automatically transfer this to my Breadwallet?
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:35:05
I feel like that makes it easier to lose

Which is why my comment was limited to ease of loss.

"Eventually every asset will be on some sort of blockchain"
Doesn't this lend credence to he who must not be named?

Can you explain what this means to a layman?

What other Cryptocurrencies are they going to?

Breaks out?

LOL Trump Coins??

Doesn't Breadwallet do this?

What I don't understand is the reason mining needs to exist at all.
Just so more people could have access to bitcoin to get it off its feet when it was just getting started? It seems well distributed now and has a market.

Got it. Thanks
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:42:05
Thanks. 
So even though it would likely never happen it is still better to transfer my Coinbase bitcoins to a  Breadwallet
Edit: Unless I then transfer the key back onto Coinbase? Maybe I'm still misunderstanding

You're talking about expansion over time. I'm talking about a fixed number that never changes.

PS I think first person who posted in this thread is shadow banned. Nothing shows up.
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:26:02
Ok, so eventually it will in fact be a fixed amount? 
This confirms my preconceptions in my original questions
