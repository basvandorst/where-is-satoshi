Well, that was fun!

I think I know the answer, but is doing something like this ie sending from yourself to yourself with no transaction fee and then reseting and sending to yourself again at a different wallet with a small transaction fee or simply using whatever method to double spend to yourself and then send from the new wallets possible?
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:21:27
Why would they want to do that? Coming up with ways to create more transactions would be their best bet.

Obviously it is up to you, but If I was you, I would cash out her initial $500 investment now and keep it safe or return it to her and then decide if you want to keep to your deal of her forgetting about it for 5 months.
Or tell her straight away the current value and talk to her about it and decide together, leaving the final informed choice up to her. 
It may just be me, but it makes so much sense in my mind to cash out 50% right now. It is win/win. She has $1k (double her investment) and still has $1k invested (again double her investment).
What does the future hold? who knows but when you find out the answer you got there with 0 risk from this point on.

He could be an aussie. An aussie would be just as comfortable using British as American and would also use the word 'Bloody'.

I don't know about the OP but for the last 2 days BTC-e has stopped withdrawals and many people transferred 1000's of btc and ltc to vircurex
only to have vircurex shutdown the website. Both sites refuse all communication.
Someone claiming to be from vircurex is posting on the bitcoin forum saying his hosting company shut the site down and it MAY be up by monday. They are not allowing access to anyones wallets or confirming the wallets are safe.
There is no hack... but something is fishy.

Bitcoin to credit card. ie issue a virtual credit card with the btc value in usd minus fees.

People are probably most excited because for 3+ years they have been investing time, money and effort into something they wholeheartedly believe in even tho everyone else called them idiots and now it is exploding. 
When you believe in something so much and then finally everyone else catches on... And now you not only get to feel vindicated but you are actually able to cash out some spending money, it is pretty exciting.
The other exciting thing is just watching how the experiment turns out. If it goes up or it goes down I am going to be interested either way.

Congrats man, that is amazing. I hope you help out a few family members etc. Remember that it will go quickly tho. Don't dump it quickly  :)

Yeah but you remember it wen't up to $74 from $0 right?

He is the one with the problem. He can love his currency as much as he likes. I don't think anyone has an issue with that. The problem is he is just trolling the subreddit.
I think the OP meant if he continues carrying on the way he is or gets worse rather than lets ban him now.

I guess instant is a misnomer, It takes a little time to travel through the network for example.
I don't know what you mean about fiat to exchange. I can use paypal, neteller, moneybookers or bank deposit to get money in an exchange. Instantly in the first 3 cases and up to an hour for bank deposit.
Receiving bitcoins I can instantly transfer them to an exchange and instantly convert to USD. I can then initiate a withdrawal to paypal, moneybookers or neteller. Admittedly if I want to withdraw from those to my bank account it takes 24-48hrs, unless I use my neteller debit/credit card to withdraw at any atm worldwide.
You can store your money in the exchange as btc or USD. So even if for some reason you live somewhere where it takes time to withdraw if you don't want to risk it falling you just store as USD.

I have no problem with people hating on bitcoin but whats the issue with circle jerks? I look around this sub and I see a lot of smart, rich people with their hands on other smart, rich people's dicks... And I think I like it!

Considering they do like 90% of the litecoin trade it doesn't paint litecoin in a good light either. Assuming this is true of course. I have no reason to doubt the OP tho...
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:28:14
If you buy the exact amount of bitcoins for USD that you need for a transaction and then send them to someone and they then sell those bitcoins for USD Then the value does not matter.
If you buy the btc and keep them in a wallet or the receiver of your transaction doesn't cash them out straight away than you are playing the market.
So, as a way to transact business they are fine at any price.

it is interesting that it was done in the increments the deposits were made and the address has only ever received the OP's coins
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:19:22
and is it just me or was it transferred in multiple amounts all the same as the deposits?
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:11:18
bruteforce sure, but not vs a phrase list.
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:50:55
If quantum computers end up being useful enough to mine up all the coins wouldn't it then only take like a couple of efficient quantum computers to hold the system up?
Assuming it doesn't kill encryption all together, like say we can't find a encryption method that can't be broken by quantum computing.

its all back to normal now. We managed to save it.
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:16:14
Yeah it is not exactly anonymous when you have to use real names at the end points. But you can make it difficult, perhaps even completely anonymous inside the bitcoin network. Just because Bob deposited money and Alice withdrew money doesn't mean you can link that Bob sent Alice money.
Also, as an example here in my country we have services such as  I can walk into a bank and deposit anonymously AUD into their bank account and receive it in an anonymous bitcoin wallet.
Tumble it through the network for good measure than send to someone.

That's just it no one really knows. His best bet is def to sell 1/3 to 1/2. If you sell a half then you just hedged your bets each way and assuming it is  as much as he is making it out to be if it skyrockets he still profits quite a bit and if it drops he still profited quite a bit...
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:30:40
Aye! I leave my screen sitting on bitcoinity so it is the first thing I see when I open my eyes.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:54:15
The merit is transferring instantly to anyone anywhere on the planet anonymously.
