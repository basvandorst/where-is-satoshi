As to bitinstant, I'm in a small enough town right now that I don't have access to a CVS... although I just realized Wal-Mart was an option. Durnit. What I also didn't like about bit instant was that 4% commission they charge. Perhaps I'm allowing that to affect me too much.

I took a look at bitfloor and have already put in the order with my bank to transfer $1,000 over. The wire should be finished today, so hopefully it all works out.

I've been attempting to get money into MT Gox for about a week or two now so I can buy... assuming OkPay will finally verify me maybe i can get some money transferred over to OK pay by wednesday... thent o mtgox by friday... and hopefully have some bitcoins then, though i suspect some shitty situation will draw this process out by another two weeks. getting to a point where one can even acquire bitcoins is a real son of a bitch.

I bought $1,000 worth at $13 in october or so. Once it started climbing rapidly earlier this year I told myself I'd sell half once it hit $26. I never did and I'm glad I haven't so far, but I know a pullback is coming.  I really wish there was a way to know what was driving this.

Ah, perhaps i should pay more attention. I guess I've been seeing more of that, just didn't realize it was becoming that frequent.

I've got a little over $5,000 usd sitting in MT.Gox. Whats the most cost efficient way of getting that $5,000 in to my hands?
EDIT: In case anyone reads this down the road... I put an ad up craigslist and sold them locally. Went through $5,000 worth of funds in about 5 transactions.  Meet up at starbucks, get cash, withdraw funds to their bitcoin address. Badda bing badda boom.

Clearly, smartass. That doesn't answer the question of what is driving demand so much that the weighted average has increased over 10% in a day.
