Yeah pretty funny
There's another reference at 21:20 when the crypto market crashed which is also hilarious haha

Good thing Payfair is adding Bitcoin in 2 weeks and no KYC is needed for that, finally can buy bitcoin directly again!
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:12:53
Yeah and it doesn't help that they vote against uncensored internet
@_date: 2018-07-26 01:04:15
Of course they run on Ethereum, Bitcoin has no Smart Contracts, or does it?
@_date: 2018-07-14 08:40:59
Only the fiat is decentralized and the escrow, the  crypto is still centralized

It's a p2p site for selling and buying bitcoin (and altcoins).
Their coin is unimportant
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:26:47
Bullshit. They use normal Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:41:28
Yeah they really should change the default.
However their Bitcoin is more anonymous since LBC requires KYC now.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:12:07
Use Payfair instead

E.g. you buy Bitcoin
The BTC goes into escrow, you transfer the money to the seller eg with bank wire, so the money never touches the crypto world and goes directly to the sellers bank account.
After completing the deal the funds are released from the escrow into your wallet.
Convenient for cashing in and even more convenient for cashing out

Payfair platform will solve this as it is the same as localbitcoin but without KYC and more cryptocurrencies!
