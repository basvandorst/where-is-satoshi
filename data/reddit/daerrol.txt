if BTC becomes the main currency there will not be gains in the 40000% or whatever, since holding a single stable currency rarely results in much real movement.

are you high? Also no one holds fiat cash, that's terrible idea. I really wihs people would stop talking about inflation as if it hits people's savings... Bonds, stocks and other products are readily available to hedge inflation. Holding cash is just dumb, like really really dumb.

IDK man I don't buy into the crazy I just try to unpack it.

I'mma try to sort out the narrative here as far as I can tell:
The concern is Gov't bailouts and the general policy of "mild inflation best inflation" eventually depletes your store of money. The gov't bail out and the general way banks lend/create money are examples of this inflation at work. 
Bitcoin, being decentralized will stop a lot of this manufacturing of money, possibly all of it. This means that your bitcoin's real economic value won't decline where fiat money is at the whim of higher powers. Thus you can safely store your wealth in it.

Everyone freaks out about inflation here. You know buying indexes, individual stocks, corporate bonds, public bonds, and derivatives have been around for basically ever and some of thse are several orders more stable to store wealth in. 
*Note stable means they won't be skyrocketting up or down, just chugging along with inflation

Everyone talks about bitcoin replacing banks... That makes almost no sense. Are mortgages and loans just not a thing in the future?
