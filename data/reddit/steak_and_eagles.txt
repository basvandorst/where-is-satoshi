I can't tell how serious you are, but it seems very by the long responses. Do you believe the only way anyone can use bitcoin as a currency right now is if that person earns bitcoin through their employment or through mining?
That's just not an option for everyone. I've sent crypto to relatives in other countries with fewer fees than I would have had to pay to send fiat- that's value.
What are you proposing? Not touching bitcoin at all?

With this mindset, you don't seem to believe any alternative currency (crypto or otherwise) adds anything? If I want to keep converting $ to bitcoin because I believe in it, and spend bitcoin to utilize it I'm dumb. If I want convert $ to bitcoin in order to hold it, I'm not actually helping bitcoin?
The fact is that bitcoin is a store of value just like USD, but highly volatile in its nascency and with distinct advantages in an increasingly digital world and independent of fed-determined production rates. Without crypto spending, there is no hope for adoption. Without bitcoin holding, it is just additional fees (except in situations that fully utilize the advantages of the blockchain, international exchange, etc) over traditional fiat. 
The finish line were all looking for (I imagine) is a crypto currency that can do anything that the USD can do *and more*. There's work to do to get there. If anyone thinks that it makes no sense to be involved in any crypto before that point, that's fine. Most of us believe that for us to get there the best way is to promote the one we fundamentally believe will be a long-term solution, and push retailers and consumers to understand and accept it as a valid and functional store of value
