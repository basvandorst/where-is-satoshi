@_date: 2014-10-19 02:30:16
Hedging is when you make a leveraged trade opposite your long investment or business.  
ie - you are mining gold at 100 oz per month.  So you buy a put contract giving you the right to sell 100 oz at a given price.  If the price goes up, you lose on your put insurance but your 1000 oz are sold at profit.  If the price drops you exercise your put contract (or sell it for profit and either store or sell the gold at lower price).  
same is done in any commodity or business.

The dollar is required for most international transactions in energy markets at the backing of the US Navy, until they are defeated, the US Dollar will be the safe haven play.  
And be prepared, when interest rates rise and the stock bubble bursts and real estate falls again, there will be a 'flight to quality' and USD will rise, which will pressure bitcoin/usd further down.

and there's the ignorance and bias, which is why i say, OP's person I have never cone across.

If the US ever totally bans it, it will become as expensive as cocaine.  Banning bitcoin would drive the price up.

This community will answer this question, I just want to remind you that Krugman said the internet was a fad that would be no more impactful than fax machines.  He's type of economics and market commenter that, if you always do the opposite of what he says, you'll likely come out ahead; a contrarian indicator.

KYC laws will mean you need a non-bank.  Best I could imagine is craigslist/local-bitcoins and find a seller who has square or some other merchant account.

These kids who think this is simple profit taking by small players and early adopters (and not government of wall street manipulation) are criminally stupid.

If you have not sold you have no losses to report.

What an incredible spazz.  Dying?  Because it gave up 75% of its value after running up TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PERCENT in a short time?!  Get real.  This podcaster is a douchebag.  I never listened to him before and I never would now.  He's nobody.  Fuck him.  
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:07:29
You are giving one right now.  You hijack a thread with repeated obnoxious requests for proof that is very inconvenient to compile and unnecessary because the question is long settled.  Its absolutely juvenile.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:38:06
yes.  anyone who bought at the top and sold now deserves what they get.  thats very few people who are that shortsighted, ignorant, and emotionally out of control all at the same time.  most buyers of bitcoin did and are doing great.
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:27:59
I get that.  
But I care more about having a true free market currency than I care if grandma statist uses it.
@_date: 2014-09-25 17:59:05
thats ok.

Newspapers have no ethics.  When something on the internet fits their narrative, it's accepted as truth at face value.

Yes.  There's a philosophical bias or an ignorance about the tech, or a hatred for the people that like bitcoin.  But I have not seen or met any honest, informed objectors.  At worst ambivelance but true opposition I have not seen.

in economics inflation is a decrease in monetary value or an increase in money supply.

Atlas, dude, it's ok to shrug your shoulders.  These people are nothing but leeches.

It could.  Dont listen to people.  Most people are wrong about most things most of the time.

Their credibility is 0.  Their rep is telling people they are passing along an interchange fee on debit transactions that does not exist, by law.  No credibility means nobody should be doing business with them, even if they think the fee is ok; companies that lie are companies that defeaud and fail.  period.  this is a disaster waiting to happen.

There is a big player.  
With an agenda beyond simply his own profit.
Probably a government.
