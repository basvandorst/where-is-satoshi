I don't, really, just a one [maybe more in the future, but not regularly] time thing for a small amount of BTC. I'll look into it, though.

You're really expecting to find anything remotely specific that could constitute anything like a stock photo, probably not, unfortunately.

EDIT: removed everything else.
I signed up for YouTipIt, but they have this rule that I can't withdraw the BTC for 45 days, which is just ridiculous, I may be doing something wrong, though.

I edited my post from before, but like I said, I don't really want to have to wait 45 days.

This will not work, because really, no one is going to buy them...

Yeah I have this problem buying anything via paypal that isn't a website. People always complain/want cash inperson etc because of this part of paypal.

That's kind of what the original one was, but how does that have to do with anything?  This is r/bitcoin

I bought mine at $3 each. Really wish I bought more than 10.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:00:02
Yep, I'm out too.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:21:21
Yep me too, had about 6.5 in there :(
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:56:08
Heh, I still have my 10.3 that I bought at $3 each. I think it's time to cash out. I'm scared that this bubble is increasing way, way, way too fast and that they are going to crash in about 6 minutes.

You're 17 and have a fiancee?

The other guy said you were '95? Anyway I take it back, that's not too young at all.
