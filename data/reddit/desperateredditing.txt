was asking that people publicly post their order ID.
EDIT: Bitinstant has fulfilled my order and gave me a little extra coinage.

3, 4, &amp; 6, good sir.
Bitcoin is something special and we're all lucky to be a part in this wacky experiment.

But if you were to tumble them it would be complicated and time-consuming to follow the trail.
It doesn't make you completely anonymous, even after being tumbled, the same way encrypted data can always theoretically still be decrypted.
That's my understanding of it, at least. Feel free to point out my ignorance.

Complaining here again as I am really anxious about resolving my order.
I placed a $450 order on 04/01 and I have no idea what is going on. I have yet to receive it.
The lack of feedback is unsettling.
EDIT: Order fulfilled and then some.

On a similar note, NASA should allow us to donate BTC to them.

Seriously. There are naysayers in every facet of life.
Just don't forget why you're here, be smart about moving your money, and don't forget to enjoy the ride.

It affects sales and purchases exactly how you think it does. Many merchants unwilling to gamble on the market value of a coin cash out ASAP.
There is a need in this time of volatility for companies, such as Bitpay, who will handle floating price fluctuations for both sellers and buyers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:37:48
It's anyone's guess. No one knows what the fuck is going on.

If deflation of Bitcoin is stopping you from spending, does inflation of any other currency cause you to spend more?
You technically miss out on any deflation Bitcoin experiences when you hold wealth in other currencies/assets. At the same time, holding Bitcoin exposes you to the risk of it losing value.
So if there is no guarantee about how much a Bitcoin is worth from day to day, why not "cash out" on your investment in the form of goods that you were already going to buy in the first place?
So long as you are getting more that what you put in, you are doing better with Bitcoin than without it. Everyone, including people doing well with Bitcoin, feels regret for potentially not retaining or maximizing their buying power.

There is nothing stopping you from making your own. Anyone can easily fork the source code of Bitcoin and make their own.
The difficult part is convincing everyone that what you have is better. Do not underestimate the power of the network effect.

I'm still waiting on an order placed on the 04/01 to be corrected. Glad to hear that people are getting their order + extra BTC for the delay in their order.
Should my issue go unresolved, however, my next deposit is going to have to be done elsewhere.
EDIT: Order fulfilled and then some.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:25:02
Not without a proper pestering on my behalf.
Their contact page looks different today; contacting them returns an automated response. These changes may imply things are at least happening on their end.
I'll report back if things are resolved.

Some people claim that their newly made orders are working.
So far, though, I'm still waiting on a $450 order placed on the 1st.
EDIT: Order fulfilled and then some.

The market surged back quicker than most news sources report. Today's price correction may very well do more good than bad to the layman's perception of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:06:59
Refrain from using all caps.
It makes you look bad and it makes us look bad.

Where is the $120 coming from?
Sounds like that number may be coming from Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:15:52
Awesome. How does the assembly look?
IIRC Unofficial BFL News reports that assembly has begun. Supposedly the boards being assembled are developer boards, which would mean another delay for us customers.

Krugman does have a valid point about the current hardware's inefficiency to run SHA256. The ASICs will greatly reduce the real world power costs of securing the network.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:37:19
So I should expect my $450 order from them in a couple of days?
I am glad things have worked out for you, OP, but as it stands I cannot recommend Bitinstant to anyone until they resolve all the orders that are still completely fucked up.
Sucks for Bitinstant, as CampBX has my biweekly business now.
EDIT: Bitinstant Order fulfilled and then some. I'll probably go with standard exchanges from this point on, nonetheless.

If only they accepted Dwolla.
EDIT: So it would appear they accept Dwolla. My bad.

How much of a loss or profit depends on many variables.
1) How much does your electricity cost?
2) How fast can your hardware mine?
3) How much hashing power does the rest of the network have upon your time spent mining?
4) How lucky are you/is your mining pool?
5) How much will a bitcoin be worth whenever it is you go to sell/exchange it?
Mining a measely .01 BTC a day may very well be worth it, or it may not.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:08:26
Hold &amp; spend, my friends. Merchants doing well with bitcoin will inevitably attract more merchants.
Someone hurry up and release a Bitcoin debit card FFS.

Bought in most of my coins at ~$25 and have already gotten, in the form of goods, what I've put into it.
There's no reason to bother selling especially with the strong rebound going on at the moment.
I do look forward to buying things with my BTC though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:56:36
I'm still waiting on my order as well. Getting in more direct contact with this gentleman would be very nice.
EDIT: Order fulfilled &amp; then some. I'm only sour that I didn't get to buy anything with these coins when the price was higher. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:24:47
It's hard to say. Orders predating mine have been resolved; orders made after mine have been fulfilled.
One can only hope that they are processing newer orders correctly.
