Your username is connected to your bitcoin wallet at the ChangeTip site. If the bot sees that someone tips you, then it adds that amount of bitcoin to your wallet. $1 @_date: 2014-12-11 12:45:59
I would advise against using bitcoin as a purely speculative investment, but if you insist on doing so, then treat it like spent gambling money and write it off as a loss (even though you may very well see gains eventually)

I am not arguing about the nature of the activity on his Twitter account, but I noticed he was here right after you linked to his Twitter and I found it funny.

He did write it, but it has no bearing on whether the original essay was fake or not. More buttcoiner disruption of this community. I feel like they are more active than the bitcoiners here!
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:28:09
I feel like tipping over social media is the best way to advance adoption, but I work for ChangeTip so take that into account. It's just easier for someone to take an interest in learning about bitcoin when they suddenly own a few dollars worth.

I can say with absolute certainty that none of the egg accounts have any kind of relationship or affiliation with ChangeTip. I think a lot of the growth that ChangeTip has seen is from the activity of bitcoin evangelists who realize along with me that it's a great outreach tool, and they have no problem with going full-throttle with the tipping.
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:57:59
There's a lot Chris doesn't know about the situation and so he is filling in the gaps with a lot of sensational hysterics. That's not to say that a decentralized system wouldn't be ideal, it's more the fact that he ignores the usefulness of centralized systems to spur large-scale bitcoin adoption in the meantime. Chris doesn't seem to get that roads need to be paved before they can be reliably driven upon.
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:54:36
Bits is good for adoption because it relates the unit to bitcoin immediately by means of the "bit" portion of the name.

The bot responses go from public to private PM after the bot has been called 3 times in a single post. This is to help avoid spam.

You're absolutely right! William Shatner, Snoop Dogg, Wil Wheaton, and Joe Rogan have all setup their accounts and collected tips. Now it's just a matter of them tipping in return!
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:32:04
What do you mean? They got William Shatner to open a ChangeTip bitcoin wallet on reddit for a tip of one bit. I think he counts as a millionaire.
