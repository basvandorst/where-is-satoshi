@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:17
I've been thinking the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:55:29

It was bush
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:49:46
I'd like to use a lifeline.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:37:45
I'm sorry to hear that man :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:47
Wtf is happening 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:04:36
What happens if it goes backwards?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:04:38
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:05:17
mmmm... personal space
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:13:54
Expected a shitpost. Was dissapointed.
Thank you though
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:24:25
LOL 
This one is great
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:42:56

@_date: 2017-11-02 20:26:07
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:25:18
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:59:37
We also hit ATH about... Two days ago. So the person you would have told to wait on Sunday would be buying at $200 higher today....
Just saying
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:41:17
Bitcoin trolled this guy lol, it dropped to 9k
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:43:39
Bigger title
More people see it
The "bamboozler" in the comment section just got bamboozled.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:06:06
Your post is a godsend. Thank you so much!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:11:43
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:56:15
O tho it'll skyrocket because most people immediately sell their alt coin from fork and buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:26:08
It will always be over 9000
The meme will always be usable.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:06:55
Apparently large enthusiasm is a problem.
People are happy something good is happening so it's obviously just all bullshit and Bitcoin is going to fail after going up from 10¢ to $7000 over the course of 6 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:08:07
Futures market? Jesus Christ.
BTC growth up to 6000 was caused by what then?????
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:26:06
It's like he goes to Walmart or something, buys some socks for 2 dollars, and as he leaves they announce that socks are now worth 50¢
That's what I imagined 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:39:31
Yea i know
It's just funny that it hit 10k-11k and then dropped.
It's almost as if it hit 10k+ to get him to go through with his word and then go back down lol :P
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:55:25
I have 135 bitcoins.
In my dreams.
*Assumes fetal position and cries*
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:23:56
I use ripio
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:06:49
Oh didn't know that 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:07:14
This isn't Pokemon go, my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:03:00
Funfair is nice
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:57:10
Really helpful, man!
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:54:01
Do bears shit in the woods?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:21:48
I thunk the same thought.
Just hodl. We all know that Bitcoin is the key to financial freedom. In the long run it will succeed no matter what they try.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:34:23
Good song.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:04:31
Sorry I have never seen a post like this :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:40:23
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:54:10
I just purchased 57 million bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:22:45
Someone's fucking with Bitcoin. I can smell it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:10:37
Y'all talking bitcoins I'm just here buying satochis
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:30:14
It hurts so fuxking much man.
Still gotta hodl.
Thank you btw, that was fast af.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:46:57
Hey thanks man! I'm learning so much every day on this subreddit. People are pretty patient
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:09:21
I would have sold. Shit. I would have been a retard.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:10:45
Thanks for the motivation man!!!! Hodl me tight.
Bad joke.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:16:35
Awesome!!! Thanks for the help. I'm moving them to my new electrum wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:50:57
Idk I just try to be careful. My brother tried that and lost 100 dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:32:07
Yea I do have to do more research 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:39:17
I have a feeling long dark hodl 2 Is coming, it'll be shorter but a harder hodl because the values are very different now.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:04:32
Is kraken better than coinbase for price checking?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:47:17
Thanks! Never would have imagined bitcoin.com itself had an agenda!
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:18:01
Plox splain
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:17:45
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:17:44
So Bitcoin wallet is a no-no?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:01:12
Much hate on the commercial...
Not understanding that the general population is stupid...
Stupid people like this...
Will make currency seem more legitimate...
That's my humble opinion
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:44:40
When it goes up I brag to my friends.
When it goes down I buy more.
But up or down... I hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:50:16
It's an addiction!
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:15:30
Thanks for the correction.
And yes, very cheap
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:08:44
Buy now, it's going to soar.
I think
Who knows
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:54:28
Ripio is a service in South America, where I live right now. I can't use pages like Coinbase because they're not available here. I even tried to proxy and what not but it's pointless because I wouldn't be able to link my bank account anyways.
I don't know of any other services for south america atm.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:08:04
I'm pissed because I don't have money to buy right now. 
Bitcoin what are you doing
Bitcoin no
Bitcoin stahp
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:58:18
I'm a very slow learner
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:54:58
Only service I could find in south america.
I was able to transfer from their services to a personal wallet so the transactions are legit but I won't be using them to store, of course!
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:46:26
I've had the same experience. Living in Arg at the moment. Passport and everything. They don't really care. Idk.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:47:34
Thank you, checking out .org now
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:30:16
I have no idea what that means lol 
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:08:15
I thought so too, but I can't find a wallet to use that allows me to work with multiple currencies. At least software-wise.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:51:37
"...unless you do a lot more research."
I'm trying man. That's part of why I'm asking questions here.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:14:21
I have nothing else that matters to me atm. I don't want to buy new shit, I don't have a GF or wife to spend money on. Im content with my life and I'd rather see my money go into an investment that seems to have a future.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:52:22
It's a joke. I'm implying that I can't afford even 1 bitcoin, so I'm buying installments of like... 0.008 BTC every other day :(
