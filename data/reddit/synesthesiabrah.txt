Ohhhh. Your title made it sound like you bought the BCash in 2010 lol
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:01:06
Ta but it didn’t exist until like 2017?
@_date: 2019-07-24 13:27:37
How did you buy BCash in 2013?

Some of the poor some of the time lol.
The entire population of the US *could* pick themselves up by their bootstraps but we both know that isn't happening either.

Do you have any evidence that a deep state exists?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:41:19
Fucking poor people, when will they learn to not be depressed and stupid amirit?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:16
The Coinbase iOS app doesn't even let you view LTC lol. They really need to update their app IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:18:11
I'm assuming you thought I was being a dick, I wasn't. I just checked again and I can only find BTC and Ether.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:19:06

I'm an idiot... I was thinking of Coindesk's...
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:32:51
How did this become a bitcoin meme lol? I remember seeing this on the front page a while back IIRC. Might have been from this subreddit not sure.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:01:55
I'll tweet something but I don't really understand twitter very well, I never use it lol. Is Andreas going to be notified of this hashtag? If I tweet this hashtag, is he going to know people are thanking him or are we all just talking to nobody lol?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:43:48
Within 20 years? No. Within 100? Probably. 1000? Almost definitely.
@_date: 2019-07-05 23:04:21
Ya so evidence like do you want me to google the word for you or?
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:55:20
Never said that lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:45:37


Aah interesting, thank you. I assumed that's kinda how it worked but that was a very good analogy thank you.

Have you ever played with FrodoLoggins on Battlefield on PC?

Hey it's me ur cousin
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:05:30
Super helpful, super knowledgeable, super nice dude. Then Roger Ver decided to make fun of him on twitter for not being a BTC millionaire like himself. Then the community donated around 850k to Andreas. Andreas is now laying low and reflecting on what just happened.

I love BTC but you people are fucking mental.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:17:16
Posts like this are why everyone thinks we’re retarded.
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:14:23
If you were truly woke you’d know cookies are a liberal conspiracy.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:27:40
Wow what a conspiracy you disingenuous fuck.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:25:56
And the reason stated was?
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:03:53
I’m calling you hypocrites.
EDIT: Because the lesser of two evils is still evil lol. Just cause something’s less evil than something else doesn’t make it good all of a sudden. And noTrump is not the lesser of two evils...
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:20:45
Which user? There’s no way in hell this is real...
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:26:46
You seem to be making feels based arguments. Do you have any evidence for a deep state existing?


Government agencies illegally spying on citizens does not mean there’s a deep state. It just means some people spied illegally lol.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:14:31
Do you have a link?
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:16:01
You need to stop assuming things lol.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:14:18
Alex Jones and now time travelers. And you people wonder why the majority of the world thinks we’re crazy...
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:28:31
You have 0 evidence for things you believe in, just feelings. You’re batshit insane.

Wants mass adoption but doesn’t care about what people think of bitcoiners. Also believes in the illuminati...
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:56:06


Why so?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:37
I would assume that would slow the drop/make bitcon go back up but I don't know a lot about bitcoin. As to how stopping transactions on only 1 exchange will effect the price of bitcoin in a positive way is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:55:35
Yes this please.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:24:47
Isn't the L3+ an ASIC miner that mines LTC?
Also, who is BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:14
What are they doing?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:51
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:34:10
What’s it like being an NPC?
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:10:41
If you believe the illuminati is real you are retarded. Full stop.
@_date: 2019-06-13 13:10:40
Yet half you loons like Trump lol.
@_date: 2019-04-16 20:05:47






Why are you asking me that?
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:32:31
Mildly ya, yet I can have a conversation without going off on unrelated tangents. You should work on that.
@_date: 2019-04-16 20:07:20
How the fuck did you get all that from his comment? He clearly only commented about not liking Project Veritas...
@_date: 2019-04-16 22:28:49
Yes. This particular investigation. I'm not talking about this particular investigation.
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:31:34
Are you autistic or something?
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:22:42
Cool. But I'm not.
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:15:22
Project Veritas? Are you fucking kidding me?
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:54:24
Because I don’t like PV? No I’m not a commie...

Zerohedge, lol.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:20:39
Un. Ya no shit. People are transferring to/from exchanges during a sell off...
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:32:27
Bull fucking shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:28:35
Wait so a 51% attack is happening right now?
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:09:23
Did you make this chart like a month ago? How can anyone take this seriously?
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:21:21
You’re right. I don’t like that a person can actually think that taking pics and posting them on twitter is enough to protect people from things that cause cancer. Oh. Wait. He doesn’t believe that...
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:03:37

Nigga that's years in crypto...
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:44:31
I don't know. A lot of people here are commenting about a 51% attack and Ivan on Tech had a live stream about it (that I just catched the last few minutes of) titled "Will Bitcoin Keep Crashing? 51% Attack - Programmer explains". So Im just trying to figure out what's going on.
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:25:27
He's too surface level to be smart. Cashing in on the Koch Brother's welfare checks isn't smart, just opportunist. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:33:15
Learn what?... Perhaps you could educate us?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:27:54
Being protected against fraud is bad /s.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:36:37
Hi thanks, is this still applicable?
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:32:14
Ya this is a scam, OP keeps deleted his posts.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:50:40


Gee, what gave that away?

@_date: 2019-05-05 04:12:47
Spreading doctored tweets to smear Leslie Jones as a homophobe. Inb4 "But Milo the "journalist" didn't know the tweets were fake" as if that's any excuse.
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:17:52
Great at what, lying and pandering for fame and money?
@_date: 2019-05-06 15:47:31
It’s been a while but IIRC she really did make racist tweets. Of course I do and she should have been banned from Twitter.

More than Dave Rubin.

If by thousands you mean like a handful or two ya sure.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:25:05
Name one person who’s said that lol like what are you even talking about?
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:39:55
Oh please...
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:16:18


based on their opinions. 
And your evidence for this is what exactly?
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:58:42
Ya no shit lol
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:31:28
No really lol I’m genuinely curious.
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:00:16
Never did that, try slowing down the next time you read.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:43:14
Ya no it clearly started before his speech...
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:09:09
Found an NPC
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:29:44
Please show me where said that BTC is evil because someone he dislikes supports it. 
Sorry Dave Rubin's money grubbing triggers you.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:13:07
When have they given other frauds a platform?
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:24:14
What else do I need? Coinbase doesn’t want to do business with a lying smearing doxxer who surrounds himself with controversy wherever he goes. If that triggers snowflakes like you I’m not sure what to tell you other than you’re against freedom of speech.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:26:37
Ya I mean the truth is like that sometimes...
