I think that there is a valid point here.
There are a number of people on reddit who's response to the MtGox collapse has been effectively ...
" Ha Ha Told you so, should have listened to me, now my bitcoins are worth more. lol!".
The overwhelming fact that escapes their deluded minds is that in order for them to buy bitcoins in the first place - there have to be exchanges.
And for exchanges to work to the reddits satisfaction: someone has to be constantly offering bitcoins at a price the reddit will buy.
In other words, if everyone only ever used exchanges to "quickly buy BTC for USD" &amp; then squirrel them away in their offline wallets, then there would be no BTC to buy because no one else would be trading.
I also believe that their stupidity is compounded by confusing a regulated currency with a regulated business. Sure, we don't want Bitcoin to be controlled by governments, but this doesnt mean that exchanges shouldn't be regulated.
I don't believe a bank connected to Mt Gox should be liable in any way for it's losses, but equally it is probably true that if Gox didn't have such problems with it's banks it may not have got quite such a bad reputation.
Don't forget that in order to get any fiat in or out of a Bitcoin exchange you need existing banks. Bitcoin is nowhere near as independant as you all wishfully dream.

I'm glad not to have cracked your delusional carapace.
Feel free to wander off.
For anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature ...
Check out the "long tails" in BitcoinCharts
For the last 18 hours I have been "Gaming the market".
That is to say I have been repeatedly placing small (0.01 BTC) bid orders at just below (0.1 USD) the ask price.
This has had the effect of making the price/spread look better than it is, drawing people/algos in
Most times,it is really just spin.A large sell order conquers all.
But the decision to place an order (even within a computer) can be influenced by market conditions.
So. Its not foolproof, but there is certainly a positive correlation between the use of my algorithm &amp; the state of the MtGox algo driven market.
What I am asking for is someone who has experience of these LargeBank/Forex/StackedOrders.
I do not understand what is their rationale

There is also the issue of trading while knowingly insolvent.
This is a criminal offence. Karpeles must be pretty sure he can "claim not to have known".

Ignorance is Bliss for many years.
But ignorance is a mental state &amp; the world continues without needing it.
At some point there needs to be a re-evaluation: and it is rarely beneficial.

What I am asking is "Why it is being used"
what are the mathematical justifications for it
and how to defeat it in MtGox.
I am asking for real solutions not the usual reddit self-aggrandisement bullshit.
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:44:38
Excellent work. Best of luck.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:00:41
As I have mentioned elsewhere.
You have an opinion - and that is fine.
But we have now basically come done to the wire.
For everyone there is a penalty for being wrong.
There is a penalty for inaction as well as action.
If you are wrong and MtGox are solvent you will not make money &amp; everyone else will.
Personally I have no more information than everyone else,
but my guess would be that even if they are insolvent we would get back 80% of BTC/fiat &amp; since Gox BTC is now trading at 25% of Bitstamp this seems a pretty one way bet
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:38:27
Very Good

MtGox is being taken down by a sophisticated forex trading program similar to ones used by GS.
You either fight it now or abandon your dreams of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:14:58
I lost Btc in Gox. 
Frankly I'm just waiting to see Karpeles "do the sit down dance in the electric chair at Sing Sing".
Bring on the popcorn.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:11:41
You are obviously not appreciating the problem.
MtGox (whether it is good or bad) - is under attack.
It is under attack by a forex trading program similar to ones used by GS.
So it's not some silly attack.
The point is that because it is an external attack they are willing to lose money.
It looks like they are willing to lose enough to bring MtGox down.
They have bought the BTC years ago at no cost and are prepared to lose it.
It will bring down ALL of bitcoin &amp; every cryptocurrency.
I know everyone hates MtGox ( I've got $22K stuck in there myself) ....
but we MUST defend it (even though we hate it)
because bitstamp &amp; btce will be next

Considering oneself one of the selected few is very dangerous because one tends to mis-assign probabilities.
We are all sheep in many areas of our lives because we do not have the time to examine everything that we are told and to uncover that most of it is simply lies and propaganda.
Before criticising me, check out "Edward Bernays" and in particular a documentary by Adam Curtis called "The Century Of The Self".
One of my friends has a print out of the list of propaganda methods on Wikipedia. He watches the news and shouts out "Number 23!" or "Number 37!" or whichever is appropriate.
He watches German TV. I've found it works in Britain just as well.
Also he's not "unprofessional" since he's not being paid.
He is merely impolite
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:22:13
What I am asking is:
a) why do people use stacked orders - ie what is their mathematical rationale
b) how do we defeat it?
PS I am a Ph.d in Mathematics at Cambridge UK. so I am not thick.
I am actively trying to stop them crashing the mtGox Market.
Unlike you.
Wake up to the real world.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:16:30
On the contrary. Markets in the short term react to sentiment, but in the longer term react to value. At present Gox BTC is about 25% of Bitstamp. This would imply that they have lost in the region of (APV) $450 million of BTC without noticing.
Deliberately raiding their cold storage to pay for present losses whilst still trading while insolvent &amp; pretending all is well.
It doesn't seem terribly likely.
Once you realise that 75% of your BTC is wiped out you come clean and give up and avoid jail.
I am NOT suggesting sticking any more fiat into Gox, but if you have it there already it seems a one-way bet to buy Btc at the present prices.
So for some the panic in the herd could prove lucrative.
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:40:05
I actually have about $25K stuck in MtGox both in fiat &amp; BTC.
I am as pissed off as anyone.
However I believe that someone else (other than themselves)
is trying to drive MtGox out of business.
The price is being driven down not by people like you &amp; I but by a trading program run by a bank/hedgefund/whatever.
The point is that they are prepared to take a loss to drive out competition.
If MtGox folds Bitcoin will be set back years in the public mind.
The world is unfortunately not run by facts but by perceptions.
The MSM is controlled by the establishment.
How often have you seen a mainstream news article praising Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:36:24
"professional" in the UK simply means being paid for it - as opposed to amateur.
I also used to have the opinion that it is only worth taking notice of people who can make a living from charging for their advice - since obviously they must be correct because otherwise they would be out of a job.
But then I looked at politicians, economists &amp; journalists.
I still recommend looking into Bernays - basically he commercialised his uncle - Sigmund Freud.
The US tobacco industry had a problem - women didn't smoke. They were losing half their customers. 
From Wiki:
"One of the most famous campaigns of Bernays was the women's cigarette smoking campaign in 1920s. Bernays helped the smoking industry overcome one of the biggest social taboos of the time: women smoking in public. Women were only allowed to smoke in designated areas, or not at all. If caught violating this rule, women would have been arrested. 
Bernays staged the 1929 Easter parade in New York City, showing models holding lit Lucky Strike cigarettes, or "Torches of Freedom". After the historic public event, women started lighting up more than ever before. It was through Bernays that women's smoking habits started to become socially acceptable. "
What? Sheep? Me?

The bubble after SR was because all those who were on the sidelines now felt it was safer to invest in BTC. After MtGox crash &amp; burn, most people will conclude that it is even less safe to invest in BTC. BTC is basically at the maximum price it can be given an assumption that it will take a lot of VISA etc money transfer fees. Unless it's acceptance increases dramatically in the next year the price is at a bubble.
All governments &amp; MSM are against it - with MtGox failure they can now bring in more regulation - taking it out of the hands of the libertarian &amp; putting in back into the establishment.

There is no "likelihood" that Gox is incompetent. That is a fact.
They may or may not be insolvent.
But many "facts" can be given "spin" depending on one's point of view.
So (fake headlines)
MtGox CEO resigns from Bitcoin Foundation! 
Will MtGox CEO now stand down?
Is takeover imminent at troubled MtGox?
Rumours fly of possible merger!
Will iGox now dominate Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:51:54
Depressingly plausible.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:50:10
Yes .. Obviously anyone can setup evenly spaced limit orders.
But what I am asking is WHY???
I have no understanding of why this is considered to be a good move by the the parties trying to bring the price down
please explain mathematically

I'm beginning to wonder if an interesting comparison might be made to the Amanda Knox trials.
Most Americans believe she is innocent.
Most Italians believe she is guilty.
Everyone has a congitive bias to believe what they wish to be true.
Personally I believe that the forensic evidence shows her not to be guilty of murder; but she still lied &amp; tried to frame her boss - so is neither blameless nor squeaky clean.
The Italian judiciary sent her back for retrial because of the compelling circumstantial evidence; and re-convicted her.
But we all know that forensic evidence is better than circumstantial. 
Don't we?
85% of drivers think they are better than average.
We all know that WE are not biased, it's just other people that are.
The interesting thing about trading is that you HAVE to put your money where your mouth is.
If you think Gox is solvent this is a unique opportunity to quadruple your money - you don't get those odds very often.
If it goes wrong - then don't risk more than you can afford to lose.
If you think Gox is insolvent &amp; you miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ... and you are wrong ...
You will feel sick for the rest of your life.
Everyone will laugh at you because they made money &amp; you didn't.
So the question is...
Do you feel confident?
Well do you? ... Punk?

"They also mentioned they did not include the rest of the BTC in cold storage as a liability in the bankruptcy filing because they intended to return it to account holders."
