I would say probably yes. I cant confirm but if I can do it with other exchanges, then you should be able to do it from another state.

New York has always been strict on investment stuff. You really don't  have many options. Maybe try buying local on localbitcoins.com?
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:06:10
You are not investing. If you are relying on an Investment to pay off debt you are basically gambling. This is EXTREMELY bad.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:09:09
That's the cost of doing business outside of the system. You get no protection. No real price discovery. Privacy has a price.

Depending on where you live in CA, $130K isn't as much as it sounds.

Bitcoin has "died" 300+ times.
Bitcoin has dropped 80% and came back stronger at least 5-10 times already. No other asset has done this and still lived to tell the tale.
Yet people keep saying it can be shut down or suppressed in some way. I don't understand.

 [LeibaBronstein]( is certainly correct. 
An asset will make money.
Liability does not make and often costs money. 
This is literally accounting 101:  [

The market will correct itself at some point. The only people likely to be buying in the near future should be Millenials and if nobody is buying because we have no money, then prices will drop. 
But then again maybe not if the FED keeps up its money-printing operations at this rate. That money has to go somewhere and usually ends up in stocks, real estate, business or anything that rich people already have alot of.

Dang, if only there was a way for governments to infinitely print and control all the citizen's money that isn't based on anything but air and faith.
Oh wait...

Fair enough. But the world isn't in a real estate bubble-like 2008. Just certain cities are in a bubble. Vancouver, Honk Kong, San Fransico, Los Angeles, etc are undeniably in a bubble.  If shacks are selling for $1 million dollars, that's the canary in the coal mine.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:18:12
Yeah I'd also say that 9k-11k is a good buy area. Based on bitcoin's stock to flow ratio, we should see a 60k bitcoin at the very least a year or 2 from now. Just buying 1% of a bitcoin at a time every week because that was all I could do at these prices. I just kinda think to myself for every $100 bucks I put in, I could be getting $600 in value back.

It seems like Powell is genuinely trying to do what is best for the United states financial interests and he can see what is honestly coming. 
Steve Mnuchin of the US treasury on the other hand is ass backwards. He literally said that the US Dollar is not laundered as much as Bitcoin. As if drug dealers are caught with piles and piles of Bitcoin instead of dollars in those drug bust pictures.
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:24:44
Fed just cut interest rates. Is ironic you mentioned this.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:35:10
Bitcoin doesn't have to be accepted by any government if they don't want. People will choose to simply not conduct business with their local currency and choose bitcoin instead and watch the money they could have made blow up in their faces. It will be like watching cars go by all day while governments are still riding on horseback.

Dang it. Wrong one....
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:33:48
I certainly do not have any dependents whatsoever. I do anticipate that a recession is close. Either next year, or the one after. No one can truly predict how bitcoin is going to react in a recession, because bitcoin was created in response to the last recession and there is no history to gather from. I expect bitcoins price to rise in a recession, not the opposite.

@_date: 2019-08-03 13:57:20
Sort of the same I'm doing. I would liquidate some in an emergency, but only as a last resort. I'm pretty dang sure we wont see another $3 or $4k bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:42:24
I certainly would agree. Should I buy a sports car now? or should I save and wait a year or two when it goes up in value and buy a house with the same amount? the dilemma...
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:34:11
Gotta risk it for the biscuit. The only people invested in Bitcoin who are in the red in the entirety of Bitcoin's 10 year history is anyone who bought between January and July of 2018.

Damn man, i need to get like you. You are seriously serious.

This is actually encouraging to hear. Thanks for saying that.

Institutions and governments cannot under any circumstance control the price. However, they CAN control everything outside of it. Making it illegal to own, reducing demand, and indirectly reducing the price that way.

BTC hash rate all-time highs, bitcoin is stronger literally than its ever been.
Edit: every

if hashpower stays the same, probably not. But it won't.
BTC goes up in price, Miners get more money. Which incentivizes even more miners to mine. 
It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Satoshi Nakamoto thought this through very well.
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:56:09
Hopefully l, I never have sell and one day I can buy homes and cars with BTC directly.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:40:56
So true though. Even though i have a sizeable amount of BTC and sites i can spend BTC with, i still ending hodling it.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:36:24
I suppose the risk depends on the time frame. I'm in this for the long haul. I'm not going to sell in 1 or 2 years. I plan to hodl indefinitely. If I planned to only hold for less than a year, then I would say yeah that's super risky.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:35:55
They will come. If they don't know now, they will.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:52:03
Step 1. bitcoin goes up in price. BTC dominance goes up too. Altcoins go down against BTC.
Step 2. People FOMO in, Price goes to new all-time highs, Whales start to sell, BTC dominance goes down, Altcoins go up against BTC.
Step 3. Long ass bear market of 6 months - 2 years. Fundamentals are bullish, yet price still down. Price hits yearly all-time lows and randomly gets a huge pump of 10-20%, the bull market begins again. Repeat step 1. Rinse and repeat.
IDK where the price will be at, but thats how the Bitgame goes.

That is pretty extraordinary coming from the head of an organization that controls all of our money.

Moving coins from coinbase to a ledger device is as easy as sending coins to another exchange. Device setup takes time though, but once set up, its ABC 123.

Yes I do have some USD reserve. About 2 months pay roughly  for emergencies. But not too much, because that could be extra bitcoin I could buy.

Sounds like their math/calculations are all fucked up. is what it looks like to me.

We still need government. Anarchist societies don't last long. 
HOW MUCH government is the real question.

Something like that yeah. its an oversimplified process of course.
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:10:00
yeah $1 million aent enough for a lifetime. If you are under 30, $2 million probably won't be enough either. should be set with at least 3.

Oh geez, that bad? Yeah I'm better off keeping it in cash or hoping it grows quickly enough to roll it over to a Bitcoin IRA.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:27:26
Which is why I still have the 401K. It just doesn't make any money compared to bitcoin. I'm in my mid twenties so I still have room to take risks without significantly affecting my financial future. Which is why I'm making such a big play on Bitcoin.

First time I've heard that. I like that, it makes sense. Kinda solves the diversification debate depending on your investment time frame.

I mean technically it can. You could just buy bottles of Oxygen. Probably gonna have a sales tax when you buy it.

Who knows, one may just be able to live off the price appreciation of bitcoin alone after 1 million dollars. It likely won't stop at just $1 million.

Its not bitcoin cash or BCash, its Bitcoin Trash.

Because bitcoin is digital gold. 
When the world is filled with uncertainty, traditionally banks and governments turn to **hard money like** **gold** like China and Russia are doing right now. They literally doubled their gold reserves in less than a decade. I expect bitcoin to be treated very similarly to gold. Just look at the price of gold right now its at all-time highs for this year. Most people think that people will flee to the US Dollar and that is mostly true, but even JP Morgan themselves stated that the US dollar's status as the world reserve currency will not last.

If they print money to infinity (as of recently, they are now), we will have massive inflation. Look what happened to Zimbabwe and Venuzuela when they printed Trillions. They literally had a note that was 1 Trillion (not 1 Trillion real US Dollars). You end up in situations where you have to bring a literal duffle bag of cash just to buy milk.

This would basically be impossible. How can you put something on a plane that does not physically exist, yet still accessible from virtually anywhere? Do you see how badly legislation does not understand new technology? They can't just say "we must search your belongings for undeclared possession of Bitcoin". This isn't drugs, weapons, or cash that they can just confiscate. This is the beauty and power of bitcoin.

They are already buying bitcoin. 
JPM Coin? Come on.....
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:47:05
I dont understand. A government issued custodial wallet there is no reason to for it to exist. They dont have to force you to do anything except pay in USD what you owe. No USD you say? No entry, or straight to jail. The dollar or its equivalent value is the only thing that needs to be enforced. 
Government: "We know you left the country with $50K in BTC, where is it?
Me: "ahh sorry I lost it, cant find it"
Government: "that's totally fine, no problem. We will simply accept the equivalent value in US Dollars. Thanks! "

90% crashes are a naturally occurring event with BTC. People will still buy it, including me as its own history has foretold.

Of all the assets I own as a 26 yr old, more than 50% of all my liquids is in BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-18 12:55:52
Nah, bitcoin should have been dead by now. And I should have sold by now, but I didn't. Being only 26 yrs old, it is not like I have 6 figures saved up. I could lose the entire investment and wouldn't stop me from buying a house a year or two from now.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:47:55
Nah I think the miners who can continue to mine profitably will continue to mine. It is as simple as that. Those that can't afford it, won't. It will end up being a few key mining companies similar to gold. 
If an asset continues to produce profits, again and again, you are saying they will just stop making money? No business ever in their right mind would shut down a business that is making money legally and everyone is getting paid.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:26:48
Yes, this is exactly why I took on bitcoin in the first place (among other reasons). This is right at the age I should be taking risks. I work in I.T. so I have a healthy working class pay and you are exactly right I have been working and saving since I was 22 yrs old. Though I first purchased bitcoin when I was 23.
I have been DCA $100 on a dip here and there for years and now I have slightly more than 1 BTC spread out in a few addresses/locations starting from zero JUST before the run-up to 20K when it was around 10K or so. I am very excited about this tech as the internet has changed so much of my life. Found work, found love, found passion, and now I've found internet money.

Man, I can only imagine how much it cost for "[River.com]( domain lol.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:50:57
The only way to stop bitcoin completely and for certainty is to shut down all of the internet. Not just in one country but in every country.
Even then, it can still continue to exist as long as there isn't an apocalypse event and computer technology is still around (it will).
You can't tell me profitable mining companies will stand up and say "Nah, I don't think I want money anymore". Bitcoin should have been dead SO MANY TIMES by now.
