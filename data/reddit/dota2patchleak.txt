Are you retarded? yes you must be retarded.

That's now how it works because you can buy Bitcoin or another crypto with that printed tether.

LN isn't around though, just because there were testnets doesn't mean that it's around, the expected deployment is at least 1 year away.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:02:27
sadly it has high rates

It IS a scam, even if what they say is true, it IS a scam. Bitcoin gained value from adoption.
Tether was created on the idea that it was a 1/1 with USD (1$), this means they can basically print free money.
Let's say that their claims are true and they do have 1.6bn, they created tether and suddenly they have 3.2bn, DOUBLED their money for free.
Worst of all is that they can continuously keep buying BTC with tether and it takes little to no effort.

What are you talking about? If you sell you still have to pay taxes, if you hold and you money increases in CRYPTO who can tell how much you gained unless you do a transaction? much smarter would be to hold.
I'm not American but that would be the logical way to do things, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:37:21
Fudder lol every single news is FUD:
Also, of course they printed more USD than US government morons, do you not understand that you gotta create the tokens to start a currency?
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:54:32
Do you not understand the study? the more people buy BTC with USDT the worse.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:21:34
They were wrong so many times they have to be on board now either they lose credibility if crypto ends up being a major player in a couple of years.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:46:05
I have alt accounts, So?
I am not the guy above, you're just proving how much of a moron you are.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:38:09
Where did they get their 843 cryptocurrencies today? we're at above 1,000 and that's the ones listed on coinmarketcap...  
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:32:49
Just like how bitcoin is promising lighting, the ethereum devs are also working on solution towards that, until Bitcoin Core doesn't get lightning out working for EVERYONE, then sadly Ethereum deserves the top rating.
I'm surprised that Ethereum didn't get a B+ compared to the rest of B's it's still much superior.

It's so weird with Elon though, he already had experience with paypal on working with online payments.
And while I respect that he said something like a friend donated me 1BTC and I forgot about it a while ago blablabla.
This is coming from the same guy that created paypal to fight visa/mcard/amex. Went all in on solar power when nobody gave a shit about it, went all in on electric cars and fucking resurrected the space industry out of being dead the last 30 years.
You're telling me that he did not believe in a new interesting payment system? he just got 1btc and forgot about it? think about it, while it is understandable that he wouldn't take credit for bitcoin why would he not have invested into cryptocurrency a long time ago even worse, why couldn't he be nakamoto?
I'd imagine he'd be one of the only people that couldn't come out as Nakamoto simply because if he did it means that he saw the death of paypal (and visa/mcard/amex) already and expects them to die in the near future which would be a loss for him.
As it is right now, bitcoin gained massive success.
Not saying that it is entirely true, but there are many reasons and things that are incoherent with the fact that Musk doesn't even talk about crypto.

As I called it yesterday... It will be 8k if realistic, 6k if pessimistic (I got told that I make shit up, lol)
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:48:13
will definitely go down to ~8k if you want to push it ~6k before it rebounces.

You don't get hit as much if you're rich yeah but you still are paying higher than everyone else, and the market knows it.
Bitcoin is in the process of dying right now.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:42:50
This will be the new FUD, release news about how they won't regulate then artificially create fud once they do announce that  they will regulate which is obviously going to happen when Germany is the head of the EU and everyone knows how strict German people are.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:56:19
Not really there's a lot of information on 4chan right now.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:29:37
So you're expecting people to donate to you by feeling sad. "redditor for 2 weeks", no posts yet somehow you say you bought bitcoin in 2011.
The only way someone in 2011 would've found out about bitcoin was mostly reddit (and a few other forums) but mostly reddit.
Unless you are a technical user but I'd doubt that considering how you *lost* your bitcoin.
I see that you also aren't American (using ’ instead of ' is a clear tell of someone who doesn't have the key in his keyboard since it's foreign) which leads me to believe that you're just a guy trying to scam people feeling sorry for you by offering you to donate a bit so that you can help your "aunt".
I'm sure I'll get downvoted because "he didn't even ask" but there's a lot of clear tells that this guy is just seeking that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:26
While I agree, 4chan leaks have the address of the supposed Satoshi Wallets and they're moving, go on /biz/ and check the threads for yourself.
Tbh a smart man would've sold the coins offline as to not crash the price and lose money while trading yourself. (Which I believe he already did and the man selling coins right now is a 3rd party)
The crypto market crashing the same day goldman says that they're setting up to start trading is a very weird coincidence, are they buying on a 50% discount just as they decide to start trading? very weird huh.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:11:35
Good, follow your own advise and ruin yourself.
Downvoting me (Clearly it was you since it's been 12 minutes in a thread with 260 comments and the only reply is you) just proves that you're just another one of those scammers trying to get people into buying like morons increasing the price for you.
I really hope that there's regulations put in place soon so that predators like you can go back to the alleys where they belong.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:32:13
please stay out of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:55:39
You sound like someone who invested a lot of money and is scared as fuck of it crashing lmao
If you don't want to lose money learn to invest instead of crying to a subreddit. Putting money on something and then not looking at charts is the most irresponsible thing one can do.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:36:41
I wanted to buy 54$ to start day trading in cex.io turns out you can't buy less than 0.01 btc... what the fuck.
Whatever I'll just buy bcash have fun with your unusable coin
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:45:54
Near future? Yes, definitely the issue is that this is talking about bitcoin reaching 1 million that would only be doable if all major investing firms AND governments started using bitcoin as their main source of investment/savings AND if there are no regulations imposed on bitcoin, but honestly I don't see that happening, most of Bitcoin's growth has been because of regular people buying not because big firms are buying into it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:47
I think we're a year or two before major players or even the governments themselves completely ban the coin and the price crashes, we're still not that close though.
Also remember that the more the price increases the less smaller buyers will get in earnings by investing let's say 100 or 1000$ into buying satoshis, at some point people will just decide to invest in stocks instead because bitcoin won't be as profitable.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:12:38
a.k.a tether and banks
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:30:40
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:23:19
What the fuck are you talking about moron
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:13:18
you take money out and you still pay a tax, they thrive from this lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:01:23
The discussion was about exchanges, you start arguing about how not everyone is American, what does AMERICA have to do with EXCHANGE'S TAXING YOUR TRANSACTIONS? Are you retarded?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:15:09
Then what are you investing into? If you invest into Bitcoin but you don't believe in it being an electronic peer 2 peer cash system then you should take out your money and put it on the crashing stock market.
