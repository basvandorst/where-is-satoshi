I am also one of those who got hooked up with this "new and amazing thing" people are speaking about. I also try to keep up with new stuff out there. Never want to stuck in my confortable zone. But after a while I found out its so much more than interesting thing. It is much more..

I dont know why this thread is made because:
* Circle cannot get around what countries has regulated concidering bitcoin.
* Fast and good custom service
* No founds lost.
I rather would choose title like: My country do not like bitcoins and this is why!
btw: What country you are living in?

Ouch, well I dont think that the price is really so bad. Because the design and because memes. I love your chairs so I would not feel bad to pay 1BTC. I just have a regular, small income from my job so I need sometimes time to think what I really need. But if you ask what price I would not think twice it would be 0.5btc. But as I said, I love your chairs. I love all about them so the price is as it should be.

True. I see this "problem" also kind of opportunity. Like always there will be things we need to re-think. But that is only good.. Problems will always find its solution. And problems will always create new ideas and innovations which will create new jobs, develop old systems and most important I believe also these kind of things will force us think more green. From what we have seen, these problems will only bring good things with them..

Can the problem be something crazy like bad internet connection during sync.? I noticed I lost connection just before fully sync and cause this error after restarting core and getting an internet connected. It should not be but can this be explained because of this. Im using my laptop as a router - I have built-in sim card slot. I have used it long and never have this problem before. But lets see, it will take 2 days again to get in fully sync.. 
To be sure, can I delete anything in core folder. Or lets be more specific, what is most important I need to keep (not even think to touch).. If I need to delete old bitcoin core and start from the scratch.. Or can I even think anything like that? Do I need to force (hope it is with me) this sync get through?
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:29:45

Thank you.. I havent noticed a latest version of core. I will update it. Can I do it now or should I just see how this sync will go? 
@_date: 2016-01-22 12:33:09
Well, My loooong-suffering paid off. I didnt touch my laptop, no updating or nothing.. Just waiting.. It got sync, I saw all my transactions, all my coins are safe. Now updated, did a backup and running just fine..
Thanks all the help I got! 
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:03:11
I agree with you. Well I start to agreeing. I do have (and had) some problems with core recently and it makes me insace.. I think I do not find paper wallet best for me tho, because I do spend, use, coins so only storage is not for me. But something has to be done, I cant solve problems and re-sync core almost other weeks. And its start to take too long to wait and do over again. Its just crazy.. Everytime I need to also wish my coins will appear. I did find core good for my use, but now I see I might look up for something better and easier for me..
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:11:28
I do have a bacon slice under 10 coins..  Trezor, absolutely, I have thinking it for a while. But never bought it..
Also, I did think to run full node also. Not while using core as a main wallet.. But I never got it working. I didnt find a solution so I gave up. I know I need to open port 8333 and I think I never got it done right. I do have samsung laptop with integrate sim card slot. So I do not have any external router and my connection is like mobile prepaid internet connection (using sim card). Its fast thought.. Maybe I will get back to this if I find my stash back to core :P Also I have win 10 so I didnt find any quide to do it.. I tried many different guides I found but no luck..
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:26:25
Awesome. Im back in business! I see my transaction.. Its like 28 weeks behind but still, all my actions are there to see! Thanks to all for your help and advice..
I dont know if these usual and normal but why core is (when startig) looking for best blockchain? Also its re-validating blocks (etc.). I cant remember the specific messages it says.. But I havent seen these messages before. Is this something came up with newest version of core? Shouöd be worrying or just normal thing? Also, I had a message saying "cant find a source of blocks (or something) when trying to sync. It told me that same before it went totally wrong. Now its back to sync but I just scare that message I saw there for a minute or two.. Im just thinking about the future, I do not want to get errors or problems like this.. Also at this moment (Bicoin Core has running like 5 minutes I have only 3 connection, normally I have 8. Might come back to 8 after a while tho)

So I can make a new address in my bitcoin core, give it to exchance, recieve coins monthly without changing address given to them? I will store my bitcoins in core, not using them or anything..
Why there is many different topics about not reusing addresses? What does it mean then? I mean in what cases its not recommended? ELI5 :)
@_date: 2016-02-27 23:12:30
Thanks, that what is was looking for. I can recieve as many action to same address as I want. About the privacy, I do not care it so much in this case. The amounts are small and also Finland is pretty easy country to deal bitcoins. Only what I was worrying were security. I do not use any sending addresses, absolutely not and now I understand what you met. About private key.. Thanks.. I might try this and see how it will go..
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:29:58
haha, You said it! ^^
@_date: 2016-02-27 23:15:05
Thanks for your opinion. About privacy, I am not worrying about it so much. Only because I deal small amounts of bitcoin and just buy them. So I deal with my exchance only. The one thing what I was thinking was security and I can see I should not worry it so much at the moment. Awesome. Thanks for taking time to answer..
@_date: 2016-02-08 14:31:37
Thank you so much! So, and I know im far behind of my first action, its fine I have all blank sheet in core? No recieving or sending address or anything?
Damn, these things make me hesitate to get in bitcoins only because Im not a tech, im a consumer who like bitcoins because of the idealism and the opportunities it brings..
This case is just weird because last time core told me it cant scan the blockchain. So I did download the whole chain but all my action was displayed. Of course uncomformed or unknow but still I saw the info there. I didnt start from the scratch then tho. So yes, I know this is a bit different case so I needed to ask to be sure :)
Cheers guys! Thanks again..
@_date: 2016-02-08 14:53:56
I do and I give my thanks for all the help! It is just crazy feeling while u import the recent backup of your wallet.dat and still core is empty.. But yes, I understand and feel a bit better. Fine when it is up-to-date and coins are back..

Im my opinion there is not YET best, not even good, choise for btc debit card.. If you do not have or cant have a normal fiat debit card then I understand. But for now, its just full of different costs. I recommended to use your fiat card as long as there will be a "full" btc card. (gonna take a long time tho..) In the end you end up using fiat so why hiding it under word bitcoin.. I have e-coin debit card (Finland) and I noticed along the process (buy btc - put them to wallet - transfer to e-coin account - withdraw to card) is pretty "expencive". Also in the end the card balance will be in USD (in future they will offer EUR card too, I think) so there is no reason to load it.. Its like using my normal card. Well, I understand if you like to pay bitcoins and you like to use them too without selling back.. But still, for me its a bit too much work and hassle, also everytime I lost some money which I could use to buy more bitcoins. With e-coin debit card, the order and recieving it was really easy and didnt need anything weird verification processes. That is positive side. THE bad thing is that your btcs will be loaded in USD to card so it wont have anything to do with bitcoin anymore. Cant withdraw them back..
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:12:30
My feedback is that its working like it should be. BIG fault is that when you deposit your bitcoins to debit card it will show in dollars so if the price is getting up, it wont have any effect to card balance (and u cant withdraw $ back to account). In e-coin account they are in bitcoins (of course) and you can send them back to your wallet, if you want. Someone said that Xapo has it card balance in bitcoins? I didnt try Xapo because they need so much information and stuff.. 
So at the moment I will not withdraw bitcoins to e-coin debit card. I have some dollars in it but at the moment btc price is so wild I wanna see what is going on. So if Im sure I will use the card along day or two, then maybe..
Overall card is just fine, big fault is $ balance in card..

I have used only bitcoin core.. When I make a buy I will do a new address (by generating a new recieving address). I do not see it before. Only when it get through and got confirmed. Then it will show in my balance and transaction history sheet. Yes, You do not have to do anything. Coins will come automatically and will be added to your balance. With bitcoin core you cannot be sure if someone will send you bitcoins. No. So it depend on you will you trust this person/service. You will only see sended bitcoins when you will recieve them. Not before. I have windows 7 and I will get pop up when the transaction is confirmed and coins are in my wallet.

Really, I think you need to be online to get the updated blockchain and coins to your wallet. Bitcoin core cant see transaction which are made later than your blockchain has been downloaded. Of course the coins will be yours, you can send and recieve them offline, but will not see (or send) them before you are up to date.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:44:12
Have you read this [Article about OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY]( I do not know if this answer to your question but give some information. Maybe it will give some view of point?

how many days/weeks/years it is still behind?
Edit: Make sure you have enough disk space (more than 32gb), enough RAM to run smoothly and also good internet connection.
If you have no bitcoins AND havent done any deposit yet I would first remove it, check what I just said above and download it again (make sure you will remove everything about bitcoin qt). I did download bitcoin core few months ago and didnt take more than 1 - 1,5 days..

I have e-coin debit card. And using it. But I can understand that it is just a normal debit card. It does not matter if I load my visa with euros or my e-coin card with bitcoins. After all I am using fiat. Its possible that using e-coin card cost more than my fiat bank card. BUT! This is the best way to show my sceptics or not-so-interested friends that bitcoin is also money. Its something I can spend and use - its not something I keep in wallet and hope the best. Its not only some crazy shit you cannot see or touch! And all the time im usind this card (and tell what its about) they are really interested! So I think this is one of the positive thing this card can do! .. in my opinion..

Today I recieved my e-coin debit card..
First I was a bit disappointed about the layout of the card. It seems to be a bit plastic like. So it is not like a my recent bank cards are. Not solid as I should want it to be. So I hope in future they will do something for the appearance of the cards. Card is delivered by MyChoise corporate. I do not know anything about this business but I truly hope it is trusty.. We will see. Love tho that MyChoise has it own CardHolder login where I can manage this card. See the transactions and change the PIN code. I cant do almost anything in my e-coin account to my card. Only withdraws and so..
The verification process was easy. First to get my pin code I can find from e-coin account phone number where I should call to get it. It didnt work. So I did verified my card straight in MyChoise website. It was easy and went well. 
First withdraw was also easy. I did it in e-coin account. No problem.. So now my card is verified and ready to use. Lets see how it will work out.. The withdraw balance got through almost immediatly and I saw my card balance as it should be.. 
All what I think is that I have used to 4 digit pin code. This debit card needs to have 6 digits. I have no idea does it matter? I have no idea will our payment terminal support 6 digit pin code? This is something I have never think about, maybe it does not matter but..
UPDATE: I figured out that this 6 digit nummber is transaction number, not the pin of the card. After registeration in MyChoise website I did call the number provided with the card. As it needed both card number and birthday (birhday was filled when registeration, I think not before given) I was able to get my 4 digit pin number for my card! So yes, now Im ready to try!
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:15:22

And If I replace it sooner than its fully sync when the balance is like it should be? I really cross my fingers now!!!

Unfortunately, due to regulations in the U.S. and India, E-Coin cannot currently ship E-cards to addresses located in these countries. We will begin shipping cards to addresses in the U.S. and India as soon as possible and we will keep you notified of developments."
I see xapo is in same state:
"We have been advised that we cannot ship cards to the United States or India at this time. We were initially advised that these were approved markets. But after some initial invite emails were sent, we were notified that those markets had been reassessed, and that we cannot ship to them at this time. We will begin shipping to those two countries as soon as possible, and we will keep you notified of future developments."

So the free% is: (0,04/1,51)*100=2,65%
You think it is high or tolerable? There is also exchange from EUR to USD and transaction fee all together 2,65% so it is in my eyes so bad after all..

Nice! I was also comparing those two cards but because I felt they are quite similar I decided to try only one of these and fall in to e-coin´s..  
If you watch their sites and services and stuff they offer Xapo seems a bit interesting than e-coin.. But I give a shot to e-coin this time :)

I believe that the first bank who will see Bitcoin as a strong opportunity will success! Its so sad to see how they only think its a threat when there is so much potential to expand their services and number of customers. I will and will always be my own bank when speaking about bitcoin. But I know there is so many people who would like to have third party organization taking care of technical things they do not understand or not want to understand. Its like finding a gold bar sitting next to you and saying " Do not want to touch it because it migh be dangerous..". I cant see what harm it can do if they take it part of their portfolio? Do they scare that people who are against will move to next bank? Why they see it as a threat? And I ask this because bitcoin is already here. Its not like a story from future which might happend if they let. Its like closing eyes for the present.. I know there is a chance that in future people might leave these 3rd parties only avoinding any fees. I know that. But world is changing. Banks should try to follow all the changes there will be and develop their services along the way..

True! Well beside of cash I will have stolen money from card back eventually. But I just tried to make my point that it doesnt matter what currency we are using. There will be always ppl who will steal your money if not careful. But its wrong to blame btc for being stealable. Fiat, gold whatever have the same fault. I hate when people are hanging them self saying its btc - of course it was stolen or something shit. I believe along time the security will be much better. And people know better ways to hide btcs. I believe we should not blame the system - we should blame the users. Educate and stuff!
