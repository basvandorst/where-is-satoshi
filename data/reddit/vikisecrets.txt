The ATM supports both buying and selling Bitcoin for Euros: the fees are 4% for buying and 5% for selling. In the long run I hope we can do everything directly with Bitcoin :)

Don't know the exact fees, but I have seen a 4-5% higher BTC ticker price there.

Excellent talk, everything Saifedean says makes so much sense :) Funny thing is that Austrian economy is not really taught in Austria ;) Austrian central bank is run by Keynesians and money printers :D

Crypto will burst the fiat bubble by educating the people about the monetary system and the biggest scam in history.
