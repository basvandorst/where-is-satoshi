I can't imagine 100% in alt coins. Bitcoin and Link are my mains. Nano, BNB, POE for the last 3%. :)
I've made huge mistakes along the way (opportunity cost losses, but never sold at a loss without solid reason/stop losses), played with alts too much, came in during the 2017 rush too, but I'm still portfolio positive.

This is basically the **argument from ignorance**, where the "lack of evidence" for something is considered to be evidence for the same. 
In other words nothing will demonstrate a problem that cryptocurrency can solve--even if proof can be given it **already** applies itself as a solution. No answer will satisfy him; therefore, cryptocurrency is pointless.
*Also, taken too far, negative evidence becomes an appeal to ignorance, the mistake of believing that because we have not found evidence, it must not exist.*

I'd say I agree at first--for adoption purposes--until people realize or become more savvy about not needing a middleman. People will start ignoring banks as a way of holding their money and new systems will be put in place in order to utilize just Bitcoin.

$20,000 will be hard to make by year's end. If we manage it and break beyond that, $30-80k seems possible.
If we don't get to $20k, then I expect this to happen at the end of 2019.

No fucking joke. I'm even more prepared for a break below.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:30:26
Mt. Gox, an exchange that held over 80% of BTC trading volume, shutdown in February 2014--just after a huge increase in price that would have normally had a correction. With the two events combined; and for the next year and 9 months, price continued to decline until October 2015. Then, price began to rise continuously until reaching a new ATH in February 2017 breaking above $1,150.
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:33:26
My conclusion was 25k--upward at 40k. I'm starting to consider extending this climb to mid 2019 though.

I'm replying in different context here:
If someone says enough words about something they don't understand much about, they'll eventually get something right.
That said, I'll only listened briefly to the video. I could tell he wasn't quite sure how to respond--he was trying to think beyond what he knew. Just because someone committed fraud in the past, doesn't mean they're omniscient.
What I mean to say is that we're interviewing a guy who has no immediate relevance here beyond his infamy over a decade ago. If we wish to apply his "experience" today, then I say, at the very least, he's out of practice.

Start buying at 20k again? Got it!
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:30:54
First test is $9,400-$9,000, then $8,400-$8,000, then a hard test of $6,000-$5,800. I don't think it will break below the previous bottom. 
1) We placed resistance at $5,800. If being up from last year is still too scary, then we would have already broke that from the last hard drop.
2) Many people from last year have washed their hands from the last rise/drop. Those that are still active today have re-bought above last year's price (6k+) and will rebuy at resistances after they've sold at new high.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:14:50
My view... this is a down trend; so that upward trend line is pointless. At the 11,600 area, we needed large bullish volume to break through resistance. Because we failed, we now have a new trend. We'll test supports at 9,400 and 8,400-8,000 and finally a hard test of the bottom. Whichever support succeeds means we're probably back in business.
Just my thoughts. I'm a TA wizard touching his crystal balls. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Edit: Normally I'd say this is a smaller correction, but the volume of selling makes me think down trend.

@_date: 2018-11-14 01:13:26
Higher chance is not an appropriate word. But holding a support *is* a psychological factor. People will buy at these levels for many reasons. And context matters too. In high volatility, testing a support multiple times can make it more easy to break. We're out of that stage.
The issue will be when a direction is taken we'll go back to the, "I told you so" phase. It's all context and probability. The bottom is solid but somebody will be right--even if odds are primarily in one direction.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:20:36
10,400-10,500 is a fib retracement line. We'll probably see some support around there. It might dip quickly below 10,400, meet 10,200 and move up; I don't think anyone can say which support and fib line will hold though. I will say fibs don't usually reverse trends until at least below 38%.
We're  and very low on RSI so we'll likely see some small (1-2%) push back as we did 
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:37:40
First, there is a lot of room for growth in the cryptomarket. If BTC maintains 33% dominance in that growth, it will increase by a lot again. Second, there is still widespread use of it on the dark web--not from first hand experience but it hasn't been stopped, I know that much. Third, BTC is used primarily for alt coins. Even if you sell into an alt, people usually transfer back out into BTC (at least to cash out). While that would be in the form of selling, it could in essence be considered long positions/holds. Fourth, while merchant support is still low, any added adoption is great for BTC's health.
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:52:35
Don't bother. For most, *nothing* will make them feel okay that any other coin exists and do some good.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:40:24
People are starting to get fearful. BTC is struggling to move anywhere because people are incredibly unsure what direction it will take; recent signals are now clearly down.
The last low will be tested and every touch at it increases the likelihood it won't pass. This makes it even more scary than the last drop, but this may be the last. 
Sketchy prediction: I believe we'll hit 5k. After, there will be a rally to 9k where we'll meet resistance, and a fall back down to 5k. That will be the finish, with a huge rally at the end of May.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:37:00
I heard high! Should I buy?!
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:25:06
Which economy--merchant support as a currency or price? I have to assume price given the concept of holding is to investing, and investing is a form of growth. Theoretically I imagine; if everyone held, the price would never move down. 
So, maybe you mean merchant support. Well, if we went with the first theoretical and the price skyrockets, how long are holders going to hold? Someone would eventually "sell" or use their currency. Fortunately, we don't live in absolutes so there's always someone selling.
But holding invests in bitcoin. Holding doesn't depreciate the value. Holding eventually turns back into the market, feeding the system for more holders and users.

There are a lot of people doing shitty TA. That alone would make you skeptical of anything you hear. But most that are good have their TA defined to their trading style. What they say may not work for you. Even then, they're just stacking odds in their favor--that doesn't mean it will happen. It's like making a coin have 70 30 chances.
That said, long term positive predictions for Bitcoin are really just guesses. You need confirmation of a reversal to even assume a positive price will be reached.

Switching from USD to BTC denotations is like switching from Imperial to Metric. (e.g. I'm going 70 KPH... so that's like... 50 MPH?) It won't be easy for everyone to switch. Your mind needs something familiar to compare to first before it becomes normal.

Depending on the size of the loan and APR, a $1000 investment would return better than paying the reasonable debt (to save on interest). "Investing" $1000 on BTC  and selling  nets you $2400--enough for the interest inquired, paying back $1000, and having some change.
What's important is the risk/reward. The more invested, the bigger the risk, the better the reward vs the loan.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:47:56
That's a big flash drive...
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:10:48
Rhetorically, what makes you think it can't? It's just as naive of a thought as someone believing bitcoin could reach $10K two years ago. We like to see numbers--big numbers--like $20K as crazy. It is crazy. And if they ever occur, they're only obtainable in moments of pure market euphoria. 
Look back two years ago when bitcoin was $1K. Without knowing price today, that's a big number in of itself. And *that's* crazy. So why would something like bitcoin--something some people say as inefficient, slow and useless--become $1K. 
Why $300? Why $10? Because people want it? Because market manipulation? Because it actually is useful? With emerging markets, it's hard to say what drives price and what the future will hold. If we assume bitcoin holds as the main technology piece--with no competitor taking it's spot--or as an index of the cryptocurrency market, or as an asset that can be considered a digital store of value, then price can appreciate further.
So how can we determine that appreciation? Well, it's both simple and complicated. We can point out market structure and psychology first, then we can talk about adoption and usage. These things are complicated and take time. The simplest is supply.
Take gold. A limited supply. A supply that grows only in slower increments, surely. Demand either rises or stays the same, but supply always dwindles. The market cap for gold is 6-8 billion. Bitcoin has a known finite supply. A supply that becomes harder to acquire. A supply that dwindles (lost). If bitcoin became 10% of gold's market cap of $7T, it would be (given only how market caps are calculated) $700B cap with a $36.8K price. That alone can explain how an ATH is reasonable.
Imagine if bitcoin was able to magically be spent anywhere. Would it's value go up? What if bitcoin was suddenly an option for wages? Would it's value go up? Is bitcoin anywhere close to those options? Hell no. But then if we ignore supply and market structures, adoption has room to grow. We haven't even made it yet.
*Is there manipulation going on? Yes. But, in my opinion, not in a large conspiracy sort of way that can propel a market in a methodical fashion designed to trick the masses, as some people claim. There are a lot of angry people out there that will go to great lengths to explain their losses in this way.*
I'm gonna end this here now. Got a little too into it. But lastly, I want to add that I got into this in December. I've been hurt more than most. It was too early for me to understand markets and too late for me to make profits. I haven't sold anything during this year and, in fact, have averaged down. Despite how it feels I still feel good about the future.

@_date: 2018-12-12 20:37:25
Look, I get the argument that people need to want it for value to go up but there didn't need to be an adoption case for $20k, so why could this cycle never happen again without adoption? That's rhetorical. It can. We've already witnessed a cycle boom/bust bubble before. Will people start to catch on for the third? Maybe. But it happened twice with value only being speculative.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:55:29
I prefer looking at incredibly conservative outcomes, at least for the short term. You want crypto to be future currency for everything but that's insanely optimistic. There are so many hurdles to break ahead. So many.
