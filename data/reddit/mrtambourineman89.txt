Meh.

Depends on how old you are and your life situation. Kids? Wife? Single teen?

Binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:58:50
Wtf is happening right now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:27
Ok.

I try to watch and listen to everything with an open mind in case I have an incorrect viewpoint. This interview strengthened my position that bcash is a shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:12:43
I'm a young professional who got into it last month. My stories just not interesting so I don't bother posting. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:26:13
You're investing in a technology that will give the people financial freedom back. Is that worth it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:12
Just starting crashing for me.

@_date: 2017-12-29 23:28:18
I got it. Had to sign out and back in and then keep retrying whole updating the 2FA. After the third time it worked. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:56:20
Nice. I teach special education. Would keep doing it no matter what. My BTC returns have more than trippled my teaching salary this month. Make sure to research thoroughly!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:30:25
Are the stats for such a state readily available or is this just basic math? Too late in the UK to think properly. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:20:28
Goal shouldn't be to be rich. It should be to find your passion and monetize it. Find something you love that the world is lacking and then fill the void with your talent. Sounds silly, but it's worked for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:37:59
Then the market will bend to your willpower. Go all in. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:03:04
You'll be in the green in a month. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:58
You get used to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:04:40
What's wrong with a Corolla?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:40:02
The "dip" was yesterday's ATH. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:55:19
I don't intend to sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:21
Diversifying a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:08:01
Dude you need a lady who understands your obsession. My gf and I always play "Would you rather?" With one of the options always being about Bitcoin. "would you rather not kiss me for a month or sell all your Bitcoin?". She understands when I say don't kiss. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:41:37
This letter is insulting. I hope you change banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:56:56
Or did you mean cost for an accountant? Mine handles my biz expenses and personal for about 500. Not bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:53
Can't believe I timed the market and increased my BTC holding. Pure luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:17:08
Did you try other dentists? I once was quoted 8k and went to another dentist who recommended only 300 worth of work. That was two years ago and I've had no issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:30:49
There's no certain in life but at least it's investing in a worthy cause. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:28:07
Not a bad thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:17:20
Dumb money is scary. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:28:19
Most likely. That's scummy though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:37:32
Sorry bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:01:26
Name checks out. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:52:42
Haha I did mean investment although profit is not incorrect as mentioned above. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:06:34
Btc is pro bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:15:22
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:55:59
If you cash out the first year after investing it's significantly higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:34:24
Post history all begs.

Learn hodl mentality vs. trade mentality. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:26:55
Be happy your debt is relatively low. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:03:41
I agree but where do you draw the line? Can someone celebrate a price rise? Is investing 1/3 of your savings into BTC too much if you believe in the tech and have no dependents? Do you just dislike those who are buying without knowledge of the block chain? Just playing devil's advocate. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:17
Still on Pace to be right. So it is said so it is done. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:02
Don't spend more than your willing to lose yada yada yada. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:02:28
I think OP means his amount of BTC which could be hundreds of coins. Still, I don't have the answer your your question. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:32:56
This my friends is why we HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:47:13
It's a rule in the English language to us the masculine pronoun when unsure of gender. This may have changed recently but was status quo for decades. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:02:04
*investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:39:13
Mine was similar graduating 8 years ago. The monthly bill was so low(after saving up enough) that I essentially set it to autopayments and forgot about it. No worries. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:18:15
True. But to them losing an investment might be world changing. To me I'd have a bad day then move on. Wealth is relative. They may be seeking validation and confirmation in their decision to buy Bitcoin. Or you could be right. What the hell do I know. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:42:12
Now you know. Hope you're still in the green. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:21:58
When I look back now. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:58:26
They don't lock in price and quantity at time of purchase? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:47:19
Thanks. Noob here. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:25:08
I'm in. Who's organing?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:45:54
Thanks!

What was the experience like on Gdax as compared to Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:05:32
You may have just realized you are a libertarian. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:55:44
No bought 12,600 worth.

@_date: 2017-11-21 15:51:37
It's just their FOMO showing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:22:50
Sure send it to my wallet. You can count on me!!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:36:27
I had to when I upped my spending limits through my bank account. I'm yet to sell through coinbase though so it may be a different setup. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:25:21
I was unable to verify my ID until I scanned it. Photographs seem to never work. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:57:25
At least you have a hell of a story 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:37
In five minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:43:14
Yeah and I fly to London in the AM. But can't miss this!
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:42:03
Same boat but bought in at double the amount. F it. I dedicated myself to the HODL mindset before buying. And hell, the adrenaline rush makes me feel sooooooo alive. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:28:15
You can but a fraction of a Bitcoin. Invest $10. Or more.
