I think this article is very sparse on detail. Here is a more complete description of this case, which by the way was published hours before wired:

Hi, Author here. Had no idea this painting was in any way controversial. I came across the background story and the painting itself and seeing that it sold for a very high price it makes for a good story.
Coindesk and other coin news websites have called it the best bitcoin related painting so far. I am not sure why you are calling it shitty or in some way insinuating that people are too stupid to see your ways and are swayed by only spam to pay almost 5 btc or 3,000 dollars.
I understand that the seller had one transaction which went badly. I haven't read the background to that story, but if you have something personal against the seller in regards to one transaction, you would be falling very low if you use that to attack a completely different work of art, the people who decided to write about it, the people who decided to bid on it and more generally the whole community, for not doing exactly what you want them to do for perhaps self interested reasons that you may have.

I think the article links to this  unless the editors have mistakenly taken off the link.
It currently shows 90 satoshi per byte, so they seemingly continue to increase. At the time the article was written/researched it was hovering between 50 and 60 satoshi.
The math is in the article itself, 60 satoshi x 500 divided by 100 million is 0.0003 btc or, according to google, 15 cents.
They go up and down in the short term though, but the long term trend seems to be a constant increase.

That's a fake article from a fake website. The real website is siliconangle.com - one l - not sillicon.

So, you relying on the promissory estoppel doctrine? 
"A promissory estoppel is the legal principle that a promise is enforceable by law when the promisor (person making the promise) makes a promise to the promisee (person being promised) who relies on it to his or her detriment."

How is a promise enforced in a court of law? I thought for a contract you need consideration which is sort of non existent here. So on what legal basis can this promise be enforced?

Define defensive in this context.
