Is there a list of wallets supporting  BIP75? I want to know it, for NOT to use them!

I bought my first Bitcoin over one moth ago! But previously I made a 4 months research for to know how the market and the price evolves.
The wallets am using are ledger nano and ledger unplugged +Mycellium and the market Bitcoin.de
Bitcoin is much better option than the banking system, even if ppl complaint about the transaccion time! 
For example: I use two banks accounts (both in the same country) every time I want to buy BTC, I send money from bank account 1 to bank account 2, and it's takes 1 or 2 complete days (2 days if I transfer more than 1200 Euro) and for to move my BTC from the exchanges to my cold wallet its only takes 5 to 10 min. Twice I made it with 0 fee transaccion by mistake, but it didn't  had any issue or delay (maybe newbie's luck).
Conclusion: it would be great when I can use BTC as a normal currency, but here in Germany isn't so popular yet! By the way, I convinced my husband for to buy a little bit more before the halving. Let's see what's happens! :)

Why did they wrote: "...bitcoin-style currency called Ether..."?
I think they should not involve the name Bitcoin on it. They are confusing apples with oranges. 
And am afraid, this is the opportunity they need for to apply hard regulations in cryptocurrencies! 
And BTW This is not fair: 
"We are an anonymous collective concerned with the lack of regulation in the cybercurrency sector."?
am not concern with the regulations, because I don't give my money to everyone that ask me for it! Those who invested on the Dao, should have research! I didn't invested there because:
1)I didn't understand what the Dao was about
2) I don't understand yet what "smart contracts" are, and I don't care.
3) I don't invest in crowdfundings
If you walk down the street, and you give your money to the fist person that ask you for, and then this person runs away with the money, would they say that fiat system is unregulated?
I would prefer they stop with that s***it! Or at least they shouldn't involve the rest of the cryptocurrencies space!

More bitcoins! Buy low sell spend high! Then you can buy more from 1,2,3 and 4!
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:39:57
Green Adress, Blockchain, Airbitz? am not sure if this last one support BIP75, but as far as I know Greenadress and Blockchain wallet for IOS doesn't support it. Just wait, for to have more opinions about it. 
But what I surely know is that a hardware wallet is the best option until now.

Fidor Bank is the only one I know.

@_date: 2016-06-17 09:12:31
MORE BITCOINS!!!! this is addictive!!!
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:07:51
A fault that creators knew and didn't do anything for to fix it! They even wrote a blog claiming that it was safe. The "hacker" was member of the Dao, he knew about this fault, since the beginning. 
That's seems to be more like an scam.

When they realise how good Investment Bitcoin is, it will be too late for them. They will fight for some Satoshis, meanwhile we will Hodl the Bitcoins. The early bird gets the worm!
@_date: 2016-06-19 19:52:24
They will get Daoed! Lol

Wherever much money is ,can be much corruption. Nothing new under the sky!
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:48:56
They earned it, by trusting uncertainty. It is not fraud. They only risked and won! They invested on a new technology, spent their money on it, without knowing if this would be successful. And they won. What's weird on that? 
These people are visionaries

Lmao, and the funniest is that they Hodl the Bitcoins for you for (an small fee, of course)  
These Bankters are like parasites, always taking and taking and giving nothing in exchange.
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:29:33

This is my theory:
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:33:56
Hahahaha, only in "Latin" America? What if I tell you that... there is corruption at every level. But, from the kind of corruption at higher social levels, you will never hear on the news. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:28:27
Until one day you haven't! And yes they can run off with your money, it wouldn't be the first or the last time that happens! Don't trust that much in exchanges! 
@_date: 2016-07-05 07:26:39
Great! How it's work? Let me try!
