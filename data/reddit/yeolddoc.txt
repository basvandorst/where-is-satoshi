Increased risk factor is a good point which also makes it risky for small LN operators. I would assume that economies of scale would kick in at some point and larger hubs can more (cost-)efficiently provide that service than John Doe.


I would like to see that for route discovery. E.g. recommend a longer (any maybe more expensive) route if it will rebalance valuable channels. Thinking about the associated UX brings me nightmares, but it would be great to have.

How do you find out if you use "the real one"?
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:57:39
- Group A has 100 LN nodes, connected to each other
- Group B has 100 LN nodes, connected to each other
- One node from A is connected to one node from node B
This is a centralization issue, those nodes act as bridges for the network and are a risk factor. You can't see issues like that in a visualization like the one you posted or the one you linked to.
Sometimes just looking at a pretty picture is not enough.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:57:13
Good question, let me try:
- Imagine a network topology like one of [these](
- Remove the node that has the most connections
- Pick two random nodes
- The probability that the two nodes you picked are **not** connected via a path through the network is depicted in the graph.
The curve of the graph depends on the network topology, different topology structures exhibit different patterns.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:34:32
Most problems can be alleviated by having a few large LN hubs - probably hubs - providing liquidity and routing.
A payment in LN changes the routing capacity in each direction of the channel. This means that the topology of LN changes after any payment.
Also you may not want to use the shortest/cheapest route but a longer one if that will top-up one of your channels. This is a very significant problem for LN and its UX.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:19:56


or they followed a popular [tutorial]( on how to connect to the Lightning Network.


OP referred to this [image]( to explain what they meant by "decentralized". In this scenario, removing all nodes with only one connection would leave mostly hubs behind.
Arguing that "all nodes with only one connection don't want to make or receive payments beyond their hub" needs more evidence. Otherwise you are just artificially removing the centralized aspects to make it look more decentralized.


This is a rather meaningless metric and can easily be manipulated:
I can create a new group of 10 LN nodes that are connected to each other and connect one of them to the rest of the current network. That node would be a "routing node" and removing it will "split the network in two".
A better metric would be to select two nodes randomly in the network and see how payments between them are affected once you remove a certain node - which is exactly what I did to come up with the 30% figure [here]( 
I think we can agree that it doesn't make a lot of sense to use the current, young state of the network to determine the future centralization aspects of LN. Unfortunately, this post is trying to do that using data that actually supports the opposite claim.

Because it is locked up in the Alice ↔ Bob channel and there are no funds left for Bob to pay in the direction of the coffeeshop. The sum in each channel can't be changed.
If you route a payment through LN you don't actually transfer coins across the channels, you reduce one channel and increase another within the respective channel capacities.
Bob has no funds left in the Bob ↔ CoffeeShop channel that could be reduced.

I see what you are getting at and it might be useful to have this as an additional metric in order to just judge the "backbone".
For a general idea of "centralization" I would not exclude them: Assume BoA operates a lightning node and lots of people have only one channel to them. They don't provide routing yet are dependent on BoA routing for them. Excluding these nodes would ignore the centralized role of that BoA hub.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:11:31


Ouch... excellent point.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:12:06
Route failed means there are no other routes between the same nodes.
Two nodes can be disconnected from each other (= there is no route between them directly or indirectly) without being orphans (= having 0 connections).
That is the difference between measuring nodes orphaned (currently at 10% without SLEEPYARK) and routes failed (currently at 19% without SLEEPYARK).
- Group A has 1000 nodes, connected to each other
- Group B has 1000 nodes, connected to each other
- One node from A is connected to one node from B
Removing one of these last nodes will **not orphan** anybody (everybody still has plenty of connections), but it will **block payments massively** (no payment possible between group A and B).

No. "Closing" a channel requires on-chain settlement.


**Bob has 0.05 BTC from Alice** but still can't spend it on coffee. This is an important constraint for routing money through LN.


**This is not true and misleads people to think that money can be routed across LN above channel capacities.**
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:42:01
Good analogy. **Also both sender and receiver need to be online at the time of payment - much like sending/receiving internet packets.***
The topology is however more dynamic as it **changes after each payment.** Routes may turn into one-way-streets depending on the channel balance and the payment.
Hubs may offer a bonus for routing a payment that will rebalance their channels in a beneficial way.
Example, channels available between:
A↔B, A↔C, B↔C, B↔D, C↔D
Two consecutive payments with the same amount, once via
- A →**B → C** → D and later via 
- A →**C → B** → D
will rebalance the B↔C channel. They might offer bonuses if payments are routed through them in certain directions. Also note that the shortest route would have been A →(B|C) → D, but it's not necessarily the cheapest.
*) Stupid question: Can we "store" LN invoices in the mempool, attached to regular tx? 
*Edit: this probably wouldn't even work because if the route changes the LN transaction would need be updated.*
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:41:58
If you say your interpretation of "decentralized" with regard to LN is depicted in figure B, than we don't have a disagreement, just different interpretations of "decentralized".
You'd be correct in saying that the current state of LN is similar to the structure depicted in figure B, and thus LN should be considered "decentralized".
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:29:20
Sorry, I still don't see the incentive. I'd expect larger hubs to offer lower fees due to higher liquidity.

@_date: 2018-01-27 19:02:28
I read this part


as your argument for why they should be excluded, since they wouldn't actually want to take part in LN but are only interested in stickers.


Sure, adding connections makes a network less centralized.


Do you see how randomly selecting nodes and attempting payments between them is a robust metric against this kind of manipulation?


Agree, but that is not the point of the discussion. The thread is about how the LN does not exhibit centralized/hub-and-spoke characteristics and provides a data visualization as evidence.
My point was that  
- currently the data does in fact show centralized aspects
- but it doesn't matter (right now) because you shouldn't use this extremely young state of the network to predict its future state
My point is not "the LN is going to be centralized, panic!". 




Thanks for proving that this is about marketing and not about facts.

How do you limit incoming network connections to peers you have channels with?  


This depends on the mode of route discovery. In the broadcasting/gossip scenario, nodes will announce channels including capacity and network address. Listening peers would build a local network/channel capacity map based on that information. This should be alleviated using onion routing but knowing your previous/next node was part of a routed payment leaks information about minimum total capacity.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:18:31




@_date: 2018-01-27 12:58:28


Disconnecting those 4 will make ~40% of payments attempts fail.
See details [here](
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:02:00


We wouldn't and we don't.
As long as they connect to random nodes and not to one particular hub, adding those random "dead-end" channels won't affect routing and thus won't change the metric significantly.
But if a lot of these previously unconnected nodes only connect to one hub, than this hub becomes more central in terms of routing and taking it out will disconnect all of those nodes. This will change the metric to show a higher degree of centralization which is reasonable.

Thanks. I think [2] assumes rebroadcasting by the sender. I.e. in order to complete the payment both parties still need to be online at the same time. I assume [1] is just wrong, but they don't provide much info.
The receiving party needs to get the signed LN transaction from somebody, either the sender continues to rebroadcast it, have a third-party to do it, or store it with an agreed upon third-party for retrieval.

@_date: 2018-01-22 17:48:24

@_date: 2018-01-22 23:15:36


Thanks. :-)


On the other hand LN nodes must have access to a private key with associated funds and must allow broad incoming peer connections in order to receive funds. This does not necessarily apply to non-mining nodes. LN nodes might thus be more lucrative to attack. Based on the discovered routes you can even estimate a lower bound on how much BTC this LN node must have the private key to, making it easier for attackers to find "fat" targets.


The more hops a payment will involve, the sooner the chosen path will probably expire - the sender would have to sign a new transaction anyway. Storing LN payments does probably not make much sense in this context. How would you facilitate a payment between two parties that are only online occasionally and not at the same time? Right now I don't think this is possible without trusting a third-party.

Actual LN network will be much more complex, but this serves as a good example to demonstrate how LN is supposed to work.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:16:33
You can only top up within LN by receiving funds (but not more than channel capacity) or routing funds in the same direction. In order to add some "non-LN" BTC you need to renegotiate the channel, resulting in new on-chain transactions.
 [Here]( is a simple example where you can't top up your channel although others sent you funds via LN.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:21:08


This is the price you pay for trustless micro-transactions, low fees and instant confirmation and no risk to lose money. Once the majority of transactions happens on LN the effect will reverse: You would find some on-chain paper wallet but won't be able to spend it as comfortably because you'd have to move it into LN first.


No. Chained transactions are exchanged for every consecutive channel pair. If somebody later on in the chain wants to try to steal funds, that will affect that particular channel only. In LN you **always** have a signed transaction that is a valid and ready to be broadcasted on-chain.


Not sure what you are getting at here. LN is a revolutionary, scalable system that allows trustless micro-transaction with instant confirmation at low fees. As long as you know its limitations, it's our best bet so far. It will almost certainly lead to large hubs (maybe banks), but they only provide liquidity, they don't control your funds.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:28:07
A spending-only channel is probably depleted quite fast. Are you sure about the incoming connections part? I'd assume that you need that also for the tx exchange and not only for route discovery.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:25:28


This is new to me, the data would need to be rebroadcasted by either the sender or a third party. Do you happen to have a link to that answer?
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:28:58


I don't mean to be rude, but I don't think you do. You can't move the coins on-chain while they are locked-up in a LN channel. For all your described scenarios you can treat LN transactions as actual, real Bitcoin transactions.
If somebody wants to exploit your LN channel you (or somebody else) can broadcast the penalty tx and you will get not only your funds back, but all the funds in the channel.

The 2015 Bitfury study also predicted a 25% dropout at 1MB.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:09:21


You can't top-up the channel from outside LN without closing/reopening it, but it might be enough to just chose a different route for another payment:
- Alice (0.05BTC) ↔ Bob (0.0 BTC)
- Bob (0.0BTC) ↔ CoffeeShop (0.05BTC)
- Alice (0.05BTC) ↔ CoffeeShop (0.0BTC) 
Right now, Bob can't buy coffee.
Let's say Alice owes Bob 0.05BTC. She could send it to Bob directly, but Bob still wouldn't be able to buy coffee. If she would route it via the coffeeshop, Bobs channel would be rebalanced and he could buy coffee again.
So you increased your liquidity by choosing a "longer" route. The coffeeshop might not even charge a fee for that cause it wants Bob to continue to buy coffee.


It stays open as long as no on-chain settlement has been broadcasted.


The idea is to have as many parties as possible being connected via LN. You would still need to close/open channels if the other party "disappears" or if you can't find a route with enough capacity to your destination. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:56:03
It's all about capacity. Let's say you opened a channel to a coffeeshop and you spent all that money on coffee. The only option to top up that channel so that you can buy coffee again is receiving money via the coffeeshop (i.e. somebody has to pay you via the coffeeshop).
Twist: that somebody can also be you if you happen to have another channel with a funded route to the coffeeshop.

- One node in A is connected to one node in B.

As long as A) both are online, B) there is a route* between them and C) it has enough capacity in the right direction. This is not a given in LN.
For example, once Bob has spent all his BTC on coffee, he won't be able to buy more unless somebody pays him **through** the coffeeshop node. Just having other channels to Alice or Carol won't be enough.

I remember bandwidth usage being a prominent argument amongst small blockers. Thinking about how in LN every payment needs exchange of two channel updates tx + punishment tx, as well as the increased overall number of payments in LN due to micro-transactions and low fees (and coffees of course), this should be worse in LN than regular on-chain.
Could we include some form of anyone-can-spend so that whoever manages to deliver the transaction to the recipient can claim a bonus?

This only applies to nodes that don't support Segwit. The majority of nodes supports Segwit ([&gt; 8000 Core nodes]( thus they actually process "real" 2MB blocks including data that is being stripped off for old, non-Segwit nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:51:35
Based on the distribution of bitcoins (many have few BTC, few have many BTC), a hub and spokes model is almost a certainty. You can't route larger payments without huge hubs. Once you have these huge hubs, there is no incentive to connect to others.
But again, why shouldn't everybody use the large hubs? You say it's the worst case. What is so bad about it?
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:20:40
Just to add one more data point that routing can get more robust quite quickly just by adding one more random channel per node:
In order to block **50%** of routes you only need to block **2.4%** of nodes right now, after adding one random channel to each node, you need to block **~45%** of nodes.
**If you are creating a tutorial on how to setup LN or give people advice on how to connect to it, please recommend to set up at least two channels (maybe one hub and one "random" node) or to use the [autopilot feature]( if available.**

**This is misleading. Payment channels are only "connected" (i.e. money can be routed through them) if they have enough capacity.**
Alice and Carol may be "linked" via Bob, but no money can flow from Alice → Carol because the Bob → Carol route has no capacity, since Bob has no funds left.
This is what makes routing in LN hard, every payment changes the capacities on the corresponding channels, turning some sub-routes into one-way streets and opening up others.

It is, but it hopefully gets better:

- **one node has 115 connection**

True, but nearly all have upgraded ([bitnodes](




Great, isn't it? Seems like cost of operation is not the only thing that motivates people to run a node. Getting more people to actually use Bitcoin might motivate them also to run a node. A congested network discourages people from using it.

Totally correct. You can't exceed the total amount of BTC in that channel without renegotiating it on-chain.

**This is a response to this [thread](
Lightning Network has only been available shortly on mainnet. I think it is not surprising it displays hub-and-spokes properties at this stage.
Please don't use the current, extremely young stage to predict how the network will develop*.
If you want to show decentralization aspects of a network, please consider using dropout-rate probabilities or distributions as possible data points and choose a meaningful visualization.
This model
- uses the data from the same visualization as the thread in question ( 
- **assumes infinite channel capacities** (i.e. the drop-out rate should be significantly higher when actual capacities were taken into account)
- removes nodes with highest number of connections first (instead of "bridge" nodes which would have an even higher impact)
- tries 10.000 pairs of randomly selected nodes and shows how many times no path existed between them (ignoring channel capacities)
- ignores "sub"-networks with less than 10 nodes (i.e. islands)
You could calculate the area under the curve to come up with a "centralization" score:
- Score in a centralized network: 100%
- Score in a fully connected network: 0%
- Score in a 2D grid: ~50%
- Score in LN right now: ~96.5% (-0.3% vs yesterday)
Calculation of score is explained in my original post.
*) I assume that LN will eventually exhibit strong hub-and-spokes distribution but I wouldn't consider the current, young state to be strong evidence of it.

@_date: 2018-01-25 12:39:47
"Centralized" entities in LN still can't steal your funds, although they could deny opening a channel with you, trying to cut you off from the "rest" of the network. This would create a market for somebody else to bridge the gap and offer opening a channel with you (maybe for a higher fee).

**Please stop repeating this. This is not true.**
You can only send to and receive from somebody else if three conditions are met:
- A. There is a path between sender and receiver via LN nodes
- B. The path is sufficiently funded in the direction of sender → receiver
- C. Both nodes are online and reachable at the time of payment (can exchange signed txs)
OPs case fails at B, since Bob has no funds left in the Bob ↔ Carol channel.

How so? Your funds are locked up in those channels, you probably need to settle them first and then open up new channels. This takes time and two on-chain txs.

I wish more articles would do that.
It also raises awareness for some issues that maybe got lost in the hype.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:57:40
You attempted a proof by **deduction** and ended up in a **slippery slope**:




"Therefore we can't allow fees to increase at all."
The goal of decentralization is to have as many **uncorrelated** nodes as possible. 
**What would you rather have?**
A) 1000 more nodes all running the exact same client, in the same datacenter and by the same person
B) 10 more nodes all running different clients, on different ISPs by different persons
 
The cost of running a node affects decentralization, because some people won't be able to afford nodes.
The cost of using bitcoin also affects decentralization, because some people will stop transacting and won't need own nodes for validation.
**Maximizing decentralization is a trade-off between multiple parameters (node operating cost being just one of them).**
It might make sense to increase the blocksize if the decreased congestion brings more potential node operators to the table than would be lost due to the increase in operating costs.

Centralization would be an emergent property based on the topology. You can't tell if a node is "centralized" based solely on its direct connections.
But if you simulate lots of payment, and a lot of them happen to go through that node and can't reroute once that node is removed, than that makes this node more "central" to the network.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:33:46
Sure, if your definition of LN excludes everybody solely connected via SLEEPYARK. You could still disconnect three other nodes to have the same impact as disconnecting SLEEPYARK.

Thanks for the analogy. Just to emphasise the important points:
- A. Routing in LN does not change the sum locked in a channel

**This is not a theoretical model.** It uses the same current LN gossip data OP used to make his claim that currently, "LN shows no signs of centralization or hub-and-spokes".
Turns out, not only does the data not support their claim, but it actually supports the opposite.

Average node connection is not very meaningful, because this is also true:

Detailed explanation [here](
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:29:43
Assuming there are no other channels than those you described:




Since Bob has a balance of 0 BTC in the Bob ↔ Carol channel, no money can be exchanged from Bob → Carol. Although they are connected via a **channel**, there is no **route** in that direction.
The 1 BTC Bob has received in the Alice ↔ Bob channel is locked up in that particular channel and could be extracted via on-chain settlement.
You can only send to and receive from somebody else if three conditions are met:
- A. There is a path between sender and receiver via LN nodes
- B. The path is sufficiently funded in the direction of sender → receiver
- C. Both nodes are online and reachable at the time of payment (can exchange signed txs)
OPs case fails at B, since Bob has no funds left in the Bob ↔ Carol channel.

Because of on-chain fees and usability, people will tend to only open a few channels. You can only successfully send money to somebody in LN if the amount does not exceed the lowest channel capacity on that route. (see example [here](
This will incentivise people to connect to nodes that have more open channels to other nodes. The more channels a node has the more money is locked up in LN. The more money a node has, the more channels it can provide.

*Sorry for deleting, you were quicker than I thought.*
Smartphones usually don't accept incoming connections, I doubt yours does, and I doubt it's possible for most in non-WiFi settings because you are behind your carriers NAT.
Also, if the idea is to create closed loops on LN, you'd need regular on-chain settlements to put the "vast majority of [your] bitcoin" into cold storage.
That is the trade-off. You either settle regularly on-chain to "safe" your coins or you need to worry about the security profile of your LN wallet (which is much more risky than a regular wallet or a Bitcoin node).

Thanks, I used the amount of failed routes after x nodes removed [here]( 
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:52:28
My point was that unless your income is already split in off-chain/on-chain you either need to regularly get funds into LN (your income is in fiat/BTC and you need parts of it in LN for spending) or out of LN (your income is in LN and you need parts of it outside LN for security).
This creates regular on-chain transactions (probably per month/paycheck) that we should minimize. That **133MB** block size figure was for two-channels per year, topping up every month brings us to **800MB** block size.
This creates an incentive to keep money in LN (to avoid on-chain fees) and maybe at (insured?) third-parties that provide this service for you (banks?).
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:25:52
It moves the focus from
- it is sufficient that you are "somehow" connected to LN to
- the route you choose matters immensely
If Alice had a channel with the coffeeshop, Bob could ask Alice to **not** send it to him directly but **through** the coffeeshop in order to top up his channel.
Do you want to manage that manually? That is a nightmare.
We need work on how the LN wallets will manage that to maintain ratio balances and how this will affect route  selection and fees.

"The" LN is just a bunch of signed transaction exchanging hands. You can exchange as many transaction per second with your channel peer as your network connection allows. It does not affect other channels and thus does not add to any congestion.

This only works if the channels are not depleted, example from the video:
- Bob (0 BTC) ↔ CoffeeShop (0.05 BTC)
- Alice (0.5 BTC) ↔ Bob (0.5 BTC)
Alice can't buy coffee even though they are connected through Bob because Bobs channel is depleted.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:45:09
Operating a LN node is far more risky than a Bitcoin node. A LN node needs to have access to the private key and it must allow broad incoming connections to other LN peers.
Attackers can estimate how much BTC a particular LN node controls (based on channel capacities in route discoveries) and will attack them based on the potential reward.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:41:24
I also don't see it as an issue right now, but the data OP presented actually supports the opposite of their claim.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:35:59
How about we "admit", that SegWit adoption is still at [~10%]( (+0%) and the reason fees are low is that [fewer tx]( (-30%) are being added to the mempool and more [hashrate]( (+20%) was added.
Mempool and fees will start growing again after next difficulty adjustment unless people continue to use bitcoin less or SegWit adoption is increasing.
Stop focusing on alts and try to improve Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:21:45
Actually it is quite centralized right now. Removing **1 node (SLEEPYARK)** is enough to make **~30% of payments fail**.
See details [here](
This visualization is misleading.
- Since LN does not prevent opening channels outside of "hubs", it will never look exactly like the prototyp hub-and-spoke model.
- The type of visualization you chose might make it more difficult to spot hub-and-spoke characteristics.
- The current state of the network is not necessarily a good predictor for its future state.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:27:10
Yes, and also because it is featured in some tutorials on how to connect to LN.
It does not make a lot of sense to use the current, young state of the network to claim "LN is (de)centralized".

Centralization characteristics increased in comparison to last week. Probably because of the tutorials suggesting to connect to one specific node (SLEEPYARK).

Actually this post was not supposed to point out any issues with LN. It is too early to make any meaningful statements about the state of centralization in LN.
This post was just a counter to one thread that claimed the current data would show that LN is decentralized, which is false and (right now) irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:15:15
The metric shows the amount of failed routes based on the amount of nodes removed.
It probably depends on your interpretation of "centralization" in the context of LN if this is a valuable metric or not - the assumption being that a network is more centralized the fewer nodes have to be removed to cause routing issues. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:32:50


The money Bob received in the Alice ↔ Bob channel is locked up in that channel. Bob does not have any balance in the Bob ↔ Carol channel, thus no money can flow from Bob → Carol.
Channels only get connected via routes if the corresponding channels have enough capacity in that particular direction. Bob has no funds left with regards to Carol, so no money transfer in that direction (be it directly or as part of a larger routed payment).
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:57:19


[This is not correct.](
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:09:42
There are a couple of heuristics you can employ, the interesting discussion is probably "What do we want to optimize for" and this involves UX to a higher degree than centrality measurements in graph theory.


**Yes. Another option would be to measure per-node centrality indices and add channels specifically in a way to minimize them.**


 
The comparison is "unfair", because the "added channel" variant has of course more channels and should be more decentralized of course. I hope that the description in the picture makes that clear.
An important note that makes this even more "unfair": The random channels that are being added couldn't have been added in earlier stages of the network (i.e. you have to connect to who's already there). This skews distribution in favour of later random assignments. Nevertheless, it shows the possible impact autopilot-features could have that close and open channels.


Much appreciated, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:29:40
Yeah, I hope it gets better. Though it doesn't change the argument about "the current distribution".
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:48:18
Shutting down large nodes will
- A) affect routing, causing possible disruption or higher off-chain fees
- B) cause large number of on-chain settlements, leading to higher on-chain fees
In the end it would be primarily expensive because you'd have to reroute or use on-chain transactions. No funds would be lost.
Based on route discovery you can estimate the impact ("decentralization factor") of shutting down a particular node. This should help in preventing single points of failures.
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:43:09
**Awesome that you did your own measurement!**
Could you calculate how many payments fail when you randomly select pairs of nodes from the network after you removed SLEEPYARK? Should be around 19%.
If you want to replicate my results, please see my original comment for details. Let me know if you have any questions.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:04:42
You are confusing the existence of a potential path within LN (Alice↔Bob↔Carol) with the ability to make a specific payment (Alice→Bob→Carol).
If Bob would happen to have &gt;= 1BTC in the Bob↔Carol channel he could spend "the" 1BTC he received from Alice and send it to Carol.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:56:56
Sure, unfortunately more connections aren't free.
Assuming the amount of funds you lock up in LN channels is fixed, more channels means less routing capacity per channel.

Please quote an objective metric or are you going for "I know it when I see it?"
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:02:11


I was responding to "I store the vast majority of my bitcoin in cold storage", so e.g. getting your paycheck via LN and "saving" it to cold-storage on-chain.


Because you don't trust your always online LN wallet that needs to handle incoming transactions and that advertises how much BTC is in it.
I guess it depends on where you get your income from. The idea in LN is closed loops, i.e. you earn and spend from within LN. If you built up savings, you might want to put them somewhere "safer".


AFAIK these are limited in the amount that can be purchased with them. If your LN wallet has only 20-30 bucks, then the analogy works, but you probably wouldn't have much fun with it cause it depletes quickly. You then either need to earn within LN or top it up on-chain.


Then you can't really use LN much, what do you do when your channel is depleted? You either need income via LN or top it up on-chain.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:06:32


This is misleading, also there is no "the network", only pairs of channels. People assume that you mean "once I have opened a LN channel to anyone". 
[Simple counter example here](
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:15:03


In my example, everybody is connected to the LN, Bob gets paid by Alice but **can't** turn around and spent it on LN.
I hope that LN topology will be dense enough so we don't get too many of these one-way streets, but these small-world examples help to convey how it works.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:38:14


Correct, you can't pay the other node unless you open a new channel.
According to your interpretation, no payment would ever fail, because you could establish a new channel directly with the target node whenever you need. (Of course you maybe have to settle your current channel because you need the funds locked up in that one). Luckily this is not how LN is supposed to work.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:12:37
Smaller blocks -&gt; more people being **able** to run nodes
Smaller blocks != more people actually run nodes
- Smaller blocks lead to more difficult (CPFP,RBF) and more expensive transactions
- "The more difficult and expensive an action is, the less people will do it."
- Less people using Bitcoin leads to less people running nodes
 
I think it's dangerous to optimize for decentralization **potential**.
Minimizing the cost of running a node while at same time reducing Bitcoins usability is the wrong tradeoff in the context of maximizing decentralization.
You get more people to run nodes when cost of operation is low.
You also get more people to run nodes when cost of using Bitcoin is low.
A moderate blocksize increase might gain more nodes due to increased adoption and usability of Bitcoin than will be lost due to node operators being unable to pay for their node.

Let me know if you find a better one.


If this is your argument:
- A network is centralized only if nodes are obligated to connect to their parent node.
- This isn’t the case in LN.
- Thus LN can't ever be centralized.
Then I'd say you have a weird definition of centralization but you would be consistent in your result. But then you wouldn't need to post the visualization of the network data.
The data that you used a visualization of does not support your argument.

Sure, more connections are always better - this does not mean that one additional channel to another random node will restore connectivity to prior levels.

- You kill node C. 
- A&lt;-&gt;B, D&lt;-&gt;E
No orphans have been generated, yet A and B can't send/receive payment to/from D and E and the ability of the network to route payments is heavily impaired.

How do you establish a p2p connection between two nodes when both don't accept incoming connections?


What do you mean by implied? How is the network info (ip/port) exchanged then?




[Onion routing](


Gossip channel discovery:




** *Edit Onion routing probably does not give you new information about the corresponding peers since you have channels open with them anyway and already know they control x BTC*


Do you have a LN node on mainnet? What's its pubkey? E.g. based on gossip, the "fattest" public LN nodes on mainnet right now with funds locked up &gt; $2K:

@_date: 2018-01-27 18:18:29
Main difference is probably that the topology changes after each "packet" (payment).
Each routed payment changes the channel capacities along its route. Routing a payment might turn a route into a one-way street or make it only available for smaller payments.
This should make route discovery quite difficult I assume.

You are arguing against the end of a slippery slope. Of course it is bad when "the network becomes *too* centralized". The discussion is about which measures can improve the current state of affairs without impeding decentralization too much.
But you don't want decentralization just because it sounds cool. You want it because everybody should have equal, unhindered access to the blockchain.
But right now, high fees make it impossible for a lot of people to use it. **No need for a state actor to censor transactions of its people when they can't afford transactions anyway.**
We desperately need a new scaling roadmap by Core.
The last one is &gt;2 years old and included **SegWit** and a **dynamic blocksize**. We need a new one with MAST, Schnorr, LN and a trade-off calculation on blocksize vs fees vs centralization.

Reducing tx cost and reducing node operation cost make it both easier for a large number of people to participate in the network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:28:53
1. You can't get 100% support for a hard fork anymore.
2. You can't claim to be the original Bitcoin after a &lt;100% hard fork.
Most arguments in the block size discussion are slippery slope: We can't raise the blocksize at all because if we start doing it a little bit we won't stop and end up with jiggabytes.
It's not about technical fundamentals anymore. The best explanation I have is that it's now about identity.
*Which one is the true Bitcoin? Easy, the one that never hard forked.*
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:09:56
Again, you are discussing against extreme positions. Why should decentralization imply high tx fee?
We need censorship resistant tx than can be afforded by most. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:49:30


@_date: 2017-12-24 21:47:24
Increasing the block size on its own is no solution to scaling but it reduces tx fees and makes spam attacks more expensive.
Also LN will need bigger blocks. The more urgent LN becomes the more urgent a block size increase gets.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:45:30
That is an interesting metric for defining spam.
 Is there any use case you know of that would exhibit this pattern without being deliberate spam? 
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:00:52




I agree. I chose route redundancy because it is one of the most talked about effects of "decentralization".


Yes. Although this probably depends on your specific centralization metric.


This also depends on your centralization metric, but you are right that it is more likely for larger network to become more redundant. I think you make an excellent point that all graphs need to be understood in their corresponding context.
I often see "centralization" and its risks being discussed in terms of robustness to attacks. In this context "route redundancy" is a meaningful metric although it is not a centralization metric per se.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:26:37
I agree. It depends on the statement that you want to support or counter.
If the claim was that LN is highly centralized and one or two hubs provide the main backbone infrastructure you would hide corresponding evidence by excluding nodes with only one channel.
[Here's the graph]( you are asking for but I would advise to only share it with a huge disclaimer. Otherwise people might claim that excluding single\-channel nodes is deceptive.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:30:55
Good point, I copy/pasted an old description. The current model actually calculates failures across all possible routes \(instead of random pairs\) in order to provide a stable result.
I will update the description.
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:52:53
This model
* uses the data from [
* **assumes infinite channel capacities** \(i.e. the drop\-out rate should be **significantly higher** when actual capacities were taken into account\)
* removes nodes with highest number of connections first \(instead of "bridge" nodes which could have a higher impact\)
* ~~tries 10.000 pairs of randomly selected nodes and shows how many times no path existed between them \(ignoring channel capacities\)~~
* tries to find a route from every node to every other node in the graph and calculates how often no route exists \(ignoring channel capacities\)
* ignores "sub"\-networks with less than 10 nodes \(i.e. islands\)
**If you** **ignore non\-routing nodes \(i.e. nodes with only one channel\)** **you get this** [**image**](
**If you try to see the effects on a 36k sat payment \(\~$3\) look** [**here**]( Roughly 20\% of routing pairs don't support a payment of $3 due to** **insufficient** **channel capacities.**
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:35:55
I must have misread your article. I understood that you intentionally created graphs that reduced the visibility of hubs in those renderings in order to neutralize those that highlighted it.
I will read it again with your comment in mind.


When you say "data" in visual representations I can't help but think "wouldn't dedicated metrics do a better job here?". Do you have something in mind that is difficult to express in a dedicated metric?
I understand that a visual graph representation can convey more information without being constrained to a single metric but it also runs the risk of being misinterpreted much more easily.
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:53:25
The idea looks solid.
This has a **huge** potential to make BTC market places (like bitcoin.de) obsolete. (No threat to actual trading exchanges because of bank transfer delays and associated risks of volatility)
Edit: For all those arguing one party could achieve a net gain: Please see the paper  The clue is, that **both** parties **lose** if one tries to screw the other over.
Edit  This protocol will be helpful to exchange BTC for **physical goods** (think eBay/Paypals buyer protection program), this is when the infrastructure surrounding Bitcoins becomes more than just BTC the currency.
 Please think of a serious name ("CoinPunk"/"MindControl" had trouble with theirs); this needs **far more** attention from the community.

Any ideas on how to improve it?
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:25:28


Could you give an example of an increase in redundancy that doesn't make the network "more distributed"?


Sure, I would consider this an attack vector as well. DDoS vs. censoring/blocking tx are the same in terms of route availability.


This case would be covered by this graph. Such hub would be highlighted because its removal would disconnect large parts of the network and thus affect the number of successful routes.

Note that the x\-axis starts at 1, not 0. As long as you don't take out any nodes, the routing capabilities are not affected.

You could at least use the total capacities as a start. But you would have to make assumptions about the distribution of payment sizes or sample them. Larger payments would be much more likely to fail early.

According to my analysis, it's is pretty much impossible to send 0.01 BTC \($80\) across the LN at the current stage. The probability of successfully sending a payment between two random peers drops below 50\% at around 0.0004 BTC \( 3 USD\).

So you would like to know the chances of being able to successfully route a payment of size x BTC over the network? It is probably quite easy to do if you ignore that the channel balances change after a payment.

*"This is actually bad news"*, because
- Bitstamp now caches the GET /orderbook for **60 seconds**
- Pusher is no alternative, cause it only list **20 entries**, compared to **thousands** via GET (although they are probably grouped by rounded prices)
This means you can now choose between 
- obsolete entries and
- an orderbook that sometimes has total volumes less than 1 BTC.
Kraken has 100 entries and updates every ~ 2 seconds.
I hope the **60 seconds cache** is related to current DoS prevention and is only temporary.

TLDR: first buy at BitCoin.de then start trading at BitStamp/Kraken
If you want to trade EUR/BTC in Germany with SEPA (no international wire, third party payment processors, ...) you have the following options (assuming you are more comfortable with the exchanges bank account being in Germany):
**Bitcoin.de** (not actually an exchange, but a market place)
    + Buy first, pay later (via SEPA transfer)
    + based in Germany
    o moderate volume
    - Sell first, get money later or never (Buyers can "cancel" their orders without getting banned)
    - Have to wait for SEPA transfer and confirmation to actually close the trade (2-? days)
    - Highest fees anywhere (fixed 0.5%), e.g. you buy x BTC, pay for x-0.5% BTC and get x-1% BTC
    - no API
=&gt; Good to buy first BitCoins with little hassle, **avoid** for trading (I'm not kidding, don't)
    + High volume
    + Good API
    + fast support
    o Moderate fees (0.2% &gt;= fee &lt;= 0.5%), depending on recent transaction volume
    - Ltd based in Slovenia
    - EUR deposits are converted to USD, trading is actually in BTC/USD
=&gt; best choice for regular trading (or few higher volume trades)
    + professional UI, Leverage, Stop/Loss/Trailing Orders
    + Low fees (0.05% &gt;= fee &lt;= 0.2%), depending on recent transaction volume
    + Good API
    + German bank account
    - low volume
    - slow support
=&gt; best choice for casual trading (or many medium volume trades)
    + high volume
    ? has API (can't judge quality)
    ? moderate to low fees (think it's ~ 0.2%)
    - SEPA depositing fees (min. amount 2000 EUR, fees: 1%, min. 15 EUR)
    - SEPA withdrawing fees (min. amount 500 EUR, fees: 1%, min. 100 EUR)
    - Ltd based in Czech Republic

Thanks, while we're at it, can you comment on why the GET /orderbook API is now being delayed/cached by 60 seconds? Is this temporary for some kind of DoS countermeasure? In the past it got you updates every few seconds instead of minutes.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:46:55
Like u/Codebender said. In this case the logarithmic scale is useful to focus on the effects of the first few nodes. One claim is that in centralized networks a few single nodes affect large parts of the network. With regard to LN this claim can be easily countered using the information in this graph \(i.e. removing the two largest hubs only blocks \~4&amp; of possible routes \(ignoring channel capacities\).

Another trap from what I understand about change addresses:
* Having a software-wallet, software shows balance of e.g. 10BTC after some transactions
* Printing its private key on paper
* Assuming the paper wallet contains 10BTC
* Destroying the software-wallet, **losing** &lt;= 10BTC
*Software-wallets have an internal log of change addresses and corresponding keys that are usually hidden. The 10BTC is not necessarily the amount in the wallets address but rather the sum of it and all its change addresses.*
Better way:
* Having a software-wallet, software shows balance of e.g. 10BTC after some transactions
* Create a new (paper) wallet address
* Transfer 10BTC from software-wallet to paper-wallet (software will spend from change addresses if needed)
* Check amount of paper wallet on blockchain.info (should be 10BTC)
* Check amount of software wallet (should be 0BTC)
* Encrypt and archive software wallet (in case you published the public key and someone sends you BTC afterwards)
Don't destroy keys. Check blockchain.info for expected amounts of addresses.
@_date: 2014-04-16 07:55:00
Please make sure you account for
- trading fees
- fees transferring BTC/fiat between exchanges
- BTC ticker price is last trade price (e.g. for 0.123 BTC) and is usually lower than the price you actually pay to buy a specific amount of BTC (e.g. for 1.0 BTC)
Often people see ticker price X at one exchange and price Y on another and think (X-Y)*MY_NUMBER_OF_BTC = TO_THE_MOON_PROFIT; but the price to actually buy MY_NUMBER_OF_BTC is &gt; X (and the price to sell it &lt; Y).
Add fees + some uncertainty to actually execute your order at the desired price and you're left with a loss or no profit worth the efforts but instead make money for the exchanges through transaction fees.
In case you find a pair that actually makes you a profit after considering those things above, there is usually a reason why it hasn't already been exploited by bots/traders. Some reasons might be
- large differences in trading volume
- perceived/actual risk of trading at the exchange
- perceived/actual issues/delays with withdrawing/depositing fiat/btc
Some of these led to the spread between e.g. MtGox and Bitstamp in the past. Some people tried to arbitrage between those two ended up having their fiat/BTC stuck in MtGox and the rest is history.
Although I don't have any experiences with renting a trading bot it speaks for the quality of the bot if their business model is not to actually let the bot run for themselves but to rent it for others to gamble.
**TLDR: If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Arbitrage opportunities are often calculated wrong and/or are often associated with additional risks. Be careful renting bots.**

I see your point. On the other hand, I find it comforting to think of a Bitcoin "base" layer that is fixed, so that additional layers on top of it know what they are building on. Question would be, how do we know if the base layer is good enough for that and at which point it should be "fixed".

This has a fixed growth and is not a dynamic block size/flex cap proposal. I will take a closer look at the mailing list to see what I can find.

I see. So far, Core delivered on most actions mentioned in the roadmap. As I see it, only the "Specification of proposals for dynamic block size controls / flex cap" is missing. This might be the crucial part in convincing those that are afraid that SegWit will be the final measure for capacity/scalability improvements.

Using the price as an indicator for demand (assuming supply is fixed) is reasonable but only makes sense when we have two coins actually being traded on the exchanges. At that point, the HF has already happened and it doesn't make sense to argue about which coin is the "valid" one by then.

This is something that I observed recently as well, probably caused by some here that argue that every hardfork is bad and should be avoided at all cost.

@_date: 2017-02-07 09:02:09


This is what I find interesting as well. This might be because it seems that Core is **at the end of the scaling roadmap**. We need a new one to show that Core won't stop improving scalability/capacity even after SegWit.
**Dynamic block size/flexcap** is already part of Core's roadmap. We need to show that there is ongoing work on that part of the roadmap and create a new one.

I would assume that Core added the scalability/capacity improvements to the roadmap because they saw demand for it, not because "other parties" had "outspoken public campaigns" for it.

I think it's good to being reminded that there are still a few ideas ahead at Core that will help with transaction capacity in the future.
But that document is **not** a roadmap. It is Greg's personal recap of the Bitcoin Scaling workshop, a short history about Bitcoins early years, some potential capacity improvements and SegWit of course.
I think it would be great if Core would supply an actual roadmap - not just a link to Gregs personal post on the mailing list. A roadmap that **concisely** mentions **specific goals** and **specific actions and dates** on how to reach them.
This would help in the discussion with those that are afraid Bitcoin won't be able to scale with Core.

Ah, I see. Yeah, if we had a majority hashrate supporting SegWit it would be fine.

I see. Both link to the same content: 
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:49:42
Could you please show more than 20 entries? It seems like you are already grouping them by rounding prices, but sometimes the total volumes are very low (&lt;10 BTC, sometimes as low as &lt;1 BTC).
Would be great if you could implement something like: Number of entries should be below MAX_ENTRIES and total sum should be above MIN_BTC_TOTAL.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:19:38
I agree.
I think for some, the activation of SegWit as a SF marks the end of all hardforks and thus puts a hard limit on Bitcoins scalability. Remember Core's roadmap from two (?) years ago? They ended up implementing nearly everything that was promised with the exception of a dynamic block size. I think Core could alleviate people's fears that SW is the end of scalability by releasing an updated roadmap beyond SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:31:13
This does not make any sense to me. We need **95%** for SegWit to activate. Are you saying that if SegWit is not activated (e.g. 6% are opposing it) it means that there wasn't any demand for scalability/capacity improvements to begin with?
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:47:52


I tried multiple BIP39 seed generators. All created the same seed - none revealed the address that the wallet provider you mentioned created. I am curious to know in how they have different implementations and who got it wrong.
I think they may use BIP39 only for the seed generation but have non-standard way to generate the passphrase (e.g. passphrase = hash[salt,pin] ). This would basically break BIP39 and interoperability with other wallets.
After looking at their source code, I can confirm they use a random passphrase/salt that is encrypted using your pin. Once their DB is down you lose access to your coins.
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:57:44
I don't want to spoil it for those that want to give it a go. But math helps.

**Core**: HF will break Bitcoins **immutability**
**"The others"**: No HF will break Bitcoins **scalability**
If you want to resolve the divide you either need to show 
that 
- risks of a HF are manageable
- that Bitcoin can scale without HF

This is something I observed as well. Which is also why I liked the HK agreement (SFSW + HF)

I tried to compile a list of goals and actions out of Greg's mail. Could you reread his mail as well and modify my table according to how you understand it?

@_date: 2017-02-06 20:16:28
What do you mean? Is Core updating the roadmap in IRC? Just because they are talking about something doesn't mean it's on the roadmap.
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:05:00


No, this is a **dangerous**. Seriously, don't use it. You don't have access to your account unless you know the seed **and** the passphrase. They only give you the seed and keep the passphrase for themselves.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:34:04
What kind of numbers do you have in mind for this? Like how many users, how many opening/closings of payment channels on average per timeframe?
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:06:52


No. There is no option right now that a single malicious block by a single malicious miner would fork of a majority of the hashrate. The described attack scenario would allow this.
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:54:03
Are you talking about BU?
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:24:53
How would we know what the community chooses or decides? We can't rely on node count. "Community" is ill defined in this context.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:30:27
You think 6tps are enough to handle LN channel management?
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:39:34
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:39:32
Yes, I think it's great that Core delivered on so many items in the roadmap and it would be great to have an updated version to see what we can expect in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-05 21:25:25
This is interesting. Until now I read his mail as just a personal perspective and only attributed the parts where he uses "we" as Core's proposal. Are you saying that because of the signatures I can search and replace "I" with "Core" in Gregs mail?
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:03:02
It would only be rejected by the SegWit nodes which would be in the minority in this scenario. The majority of hashpower would accept it as valid, causing a split.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:03:02
What are the risks of having it activated with only a minority of hashpower supporting it?
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:13:49
The 4MB figure describes the worst case. This is the relevant quote from the roadmap:


@_date: 2017-02-27 01:45:12
Cost of hashpower for a single malicous block &lt;&lt; Cost of 51% hashpower.
Please see the discussion I linked to.
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:06:13


Actually, I'm not sure. Have you read any responses by the miners?
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:55:02
Thanks. I got the same numbers. I'd probably assume more channel maintenance in the beginning than twice per year, but I agree on the overall direction. I'd also like to allow more than 100M channels - but this would probably be a nice problem to have. Let's hope Lightning will be ready before the 5 years are over.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:04:19
This is why I was asking if I had missed something. This is the link: 
What do you think should be added? The list in my original post is copy &amp; paste out of Greg's mail.
@_date: 2017-02-07 09:07:13
I can see point that it would help the development process to know if SegWit will be activated and thus if developers can build upon it.
Core already put "dynamic blocksize/flexcap" on the roadmap which is a very good sign. There are probably already a few proposals on the mailing list that haven't found their way to r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 21:13:41
When exchanges are trading both coins the hard fork has already happened.
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:50:20
I see your point. Do you have an idea how we could "estimate" economic activity that is in favour of BU?
@_date: 2017-02-07 09:36:22


This sounds dangerous to me. 95% was chosen for a reason, no?


Totally agree. I have the impression that some fear that Core will stop with the capacity/scalability improvements once SegWit is activated. An updated roadmap might help to alleviate these fears. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:39:13
AFAIK this is Core's official roadmap. Are you saying that roadmap is obsolete? Is there a new one?

You don't build a robust, anti-fragile network that is supposed to disrupt the global financial network by asking people to "Please, Stop attacking me!"
You adapt to the attacks and change the network. 
If Bitcoin is easily spammed, i.e. a small number of evil actors can easily/cheaply disrupt the network for the rest of us, than Bitcoin has a problem and needs to adapt. Period.

If we could get them to update their bridging nodes they would probably not run old nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:08:23


No. The confirmation times would be 13min/**40min** in this scenario. Plus the majority hashrate will attack the minority chain, making things even worse.


No. Difficulty adjustment would also be slowed down, to 18days/**8 weeks**. But that doesn't matter, because you will still be attacked by the majority hashrate, unless you change PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:50:52


Again, forking off the majority hashrate is bad and will hurt Bitcoin as a whole, not the miners.
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:15:26
This puzzle advertises the use of a certain wallet provider.
They appear to use BIP39 and give you the impression that you are in control of your coins. You are not, they create a random password in their db that is encrypted with your PIN. Once they are down, you lose access to your coins.
**You won't be able to restore your account using the seed anywhere else.**
Please don't use them.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:51:03
How do old clients recognise malicious blocks? 
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:48:59


This is a reasoning I can follow - although not signalling might also mean that they do want an upgrade to capacity but not in SegWit form. However, this is not what said, he didn't talk about a **"small portion of the mining industry"**. He was talking about **"not activating" at all**, which in the context of SegWit means **"less than 95%"** which is not necessarily a small portion at all.
But I agree that it doesn't make a lot of sense to discuss about what miners want to tell us by not activating SegWit and making up reasons why they do it. Could Core please hire a translator and get in contact to find out their **actual** reasons?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:02:53
Is there a node counting service that is not biased towards a certain client?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:13:23


How do you make sure that the majority of hashpower is 
- running SegWit-compatible clients or
- is behind a SegWit-compatible bridging node?
**Right now the majority of hashpower cannot be bothered to update. I doubt that they will update their bridging node but keep mining with their old clients.** 
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:27:38
Wow. This would be like 4.000 new nodes using luke-jr's method. That sounds a lot for a few weeks.

Thanks for compiling a much needed overview (esp. the risk assessment table). Are there more dimensions beside chain split and orphan risk that we could use to assess different fork scenarios?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:48:28
Agreed. Although I would strongly advocate to not use the term "ChinaBU" - you probably did not mean in that way, but it has a certain ring of xenophobia and nationalism to it.

I should have been more specific. I was referring to this:

If you don't treat the risk of a **chain split, slower confirmation times, hashrate attacks and price drops** as disadvantages I don't know what else to tell you. Even if you assign little probability of that happening the sheer damage it would cause advocates against risking it. **Let's keep Bitcoin safe and robust.**

How does this affect the decentralization debate? Having an order of magnitude more nodes surely improves decentralization, no?
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:43:50


~~Using this definition, a UASF would qualify as a semi-compatible hard-fork once a block is being relayed that is invalid to SegWit miners but valid to non-Segwit miners.~~ The following chain split would be severe unless there is a majority of hashrate behind SegWit.
Edit: Wrong, cause I missed **for each chain**.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:31:02




No. Difficulty reset will take 47 days and even after that time you are vulnerable against continuing hashrate attacks unless you change PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:28:57
Still, claiming that miners are "attacking" through inaction is a bad narrative to find a solution.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:52:49
Yes. I could probably even get behind it in a 75% setting if times get rough. But 30% is not only creating a chain split, it will be on the losing side. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:45:42
I see. I think this was before Greg's post and they might even be mentioned already in the roadmap:


The roadmap was talking about specifying these proposals in more detail.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:04:33
Hm... I think I see where you are going at.
Let's assume we activate SegWit with 75% agreement of the bitcoin "economy" (whatever that means) and 25% of hashpower. Some miner broadcasts a block for whatever reason that is considered invalid by 75% of the bitcoin economy and is considered valid by 75% of the miners.
This creates a serious chain split, leaving the SegWit chain with 25% of the hashrate. How would you assume this would be resolved?
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:09:04
What part are you interested in?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:42:35
I don't really care if they protect themselves or not. Who protects the holders that risk losing money because of the chain split risk? It is our money that I care about, not the miners'.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:53:43
Well, Circle wanted to get rid of their Bitcoin users anyway.

Should we ask the "economic majority"?
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:28:38
Most people in Bitcoin worry about 51% attacks. You even ignore the risks associated with a 75% "attack".
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:51:14
Yes, if you hold your private key. If not, move your coins to a wallet that you control.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:26:01


Somebody should ask them why they won't update.


Forking off the majority hashrate is bad. "You are either with us or against us"-attitude is bad. Find a solution by talking to the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:42:15
You are advocating for UASF. I made the point that UASF without a hashrate majority has a high risk of a chain split. A chain split will most likely lead to a loss of Bitcoin's valuation at least in the short term. This is a loss to everybody holding Bitcoin and not only to those that took a side in the Segwit debate. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:31:07


If the trouble makers are in the (hashrate) majority you are going to be in trouble.
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:52:48
Only in the case of hashrate majority. In the case of hashrate minority one results in a chain split, the other results in status quo.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:38:06


If you activate SegWit without the majority of miners, **you will get a chain split**.
Are you suggesting that miners should be afraid of the split and thus should be coerced to update to SegWit compatible clients?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:03:02


What would take longer?
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:00:06
This is the problem. It will not reject the spending of any Segwit tx whereas new clients will correctly verify them and might reject invalid ones. To old clients all anyonecanspend tx are "valid" . 
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:23:34
I'll take a link instead of a copy &amp; paste please.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:36:57
Good point. Are you suggesting to trigger the split yourself to reduce difficulty adjustment? Cause the malicious attacker will cause the split right after an adjustment to cause max reset duration.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:22:28
That is some work and you still risk leaking personal info. This should be enough: 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:48:52
Nice... You found an incentive for an attacker to actually pull this. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:18:54
Yes, but first it creates a split that may or may not resolve. This is why you want to have as much hash power as possible on the "right" side. This split will only resolve if the Segwit chain has more hashrate. The more hashrate, the faster the resolve. Around or less than 50%: no resolve, increased blocktimes, price crash, etc... 
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:32:32
You can't get reliable answers using polls on Reddit. Anybody could just pay a few bucks to rig it in any way they want.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:55:32
This is an attack vector. If all it takes to cause a chain split is a single block, it will happen... Just for wreaking havoc or the lulz or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:37:36
You can't force them to update. Threatening them with a chain split is a nuclear option. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:21:10
Can you show me another source that claims ~40.000 nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:55:28


No. This is different. You don't need a malicious group of miners to pull this. You only need **one actor** to rent enough hashrate for **one block** at **one point in time**. This will create a split for all non-malicious nodes and miners that haven't updated in the whole rest of the network. (In the meantime the attacker can even make loads of money by a leveraged short as suggested by &gt; When you understand that those are the only two circumstances under which this can occur, you recognize that it isn't UASF that's an issue, it's miners, and you develop a solution accordingly.
What kind of solution could protect against that one malicious attacker I described above?
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:51:31
Yes. The miners/nodes that don't understand Segwit  are causing the problem. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:35:27
Please talk to the miners and find out if "they" are against "us". This is a narrative that is not helpful in  finding a solution in the scaling debate. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:44:24


I agree. But the chain split has already happened by then and the damage is already done. Depending on the hashrate distribution the chain split may not resolve at all or only very slowly. Slow blocks and hashrate attacks will affect Bitcoin's reputation and value. The only option to avoid that is majority hashrate at the beginning, not at the end. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:51:07
Nice summary. I would argue that it might even be enough for **Core to update their scaling roadmap**. They implemented everything that was promised in the last one and even mentioned dynamic block size caps.
**An updated scaling roadmap that goes beyond SegWit might alleviate the fears that the activation of SegWit will mean no HF ever and an end to Bitcoins scalability.**
Be prepared for a lot of "if you are not with us, you are against us" narratives from the divide-and-conquer camp.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:07:23
I don't follow. Are you saying that the only disadvantage of a UASF at 10% hashrate are increased confirmation times/block times?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:31:58
If his numbers are correct, I wonder what the others are doing wrong.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:53:00
I mostly agree. Especially because of the


I think it is important to be able to point to the roadmap and say: 
"See, once we have SegWit we can do even cooler stuff like X,Y,Z"

Yes. Exactly the right questions. If only somebody could redirect them to the miners...
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:56:14


No. This is different. You don't need a malicious group of miners to pull this. You only need **one actor** to rent enough hashrate for **one block** at **one point in time**.

@_date: 2017-03-14 10:36:15
The problem is not that some miner or node is forced to process it. The problem is that non-upgraded clients are **unable** to process it correctly (thus treating all Segwit tx as valid), **unless they update**. But if we could get them to update to SegWit-compatible clients we wouldn't have that problem in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:55:07




No, it is not. UASF is a recent idea that came up because miners did not switch. Most companies that signalled readiness did so before UASF was discussed.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:53:08
As long as you control your bitcoins, you are safe. If you have the coins on an exchange, it depends on the exchange's policy on how coins are handled after a fork. Best to be on the safe side and transfer the coins to a wallet that you control.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:19:52
UASF will trigger a chain split unless there is a majority of hashpower behind it. All it takes is one block with a specially crafted transaction that is invalid to SegWit miners but valid to non-SegWit miners.
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:23:57
Yes. But you can't fork only that miner off. If there is one invalid Segwit block, all non upgraded miners will have to fork off although they did not take any part in that attack. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:39:26
How is that effect different from a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:19:09
Could you elaborate on that? It seems like miners would be forced to update either way.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:07:58
Ask the miners why they don't switch.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:38:41
I trust that Core will either find a way to scale without risking the chain split or convince the miners to upgrade.
By the way, did somebody ask the miners why they won't switch?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:44:43
They do. And these border nodes don't know Segwit (yet). How would the border node know that they are relaying invalid blocks? They don't. Miners would need to take action to update them. But miners don't want to update. What now? A border node for border nodes? Same problem and so on and so on. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:24:48
I see. Still I wouldn't consider the actions of one chinese miner as evidence for government involvement.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:00:25


1. Non-SegWit miners can't validate SegWit tx.
2. Non-SegWit miners treat all SegWit tx as valid
3. Non-SegWit miners will treat an invalid SegWit tx as valid
4. SegWit miners will treat an invalid SegWit tx as invalid
5. SegWit miners and Non-SegWit miners will split once somebody broadcasts a block including an invalid SegWit tx
Miners are not able to prevent a chain split, unless they update to SegWit.
If you could force miners to update to SegWit, we wouldn't have this problem.
Unless you are suggesting that threatening with a nuclear chain split option is your solution to coerce them to update.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:15:25
This is an assumption on your part on why the miners are behaving that way. Again, ask the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:34:16


In the described scenario they represent the non-upgraded/non-SegWit miners which are in the majority.
You are advocating for the majority of hashrate to fork off. 
You will be left with a minority chain that has low confirmation times that can be easily attacked by the hashrate majority.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:38:35


It's not your fault. It has only been added yesterday. The original proposal on the mailing list did not include the rejection of blocks that don't signal support.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:10:58
Doesn't matter, damage would be already done.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:59:58


Well, they run old software which does not understand SegWit.
In the scenario we are discussing they are in the majority. Why should they update to a software run by the minority?
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:07:06
A chain split with the hashrate majority behind it will cause serious damage and won't be resolved in a few blocks - if at all. Because, having the hashrate majority, **all non-segwit miners** will mine their chain faster than any other chain. The SegWit chain would be crippled without the majority of the hashrate, would have slow confirmation times, delayed difficulty adjustments, etc...

I share the same concern regarding a state actor attacking Bitcoin. But as long as we don't have any evidence that the Chinese government is actively involved we should be careful in our wording. We might argue about the actual power the miners have but they are still an important part in the ecosystem. We should not alienate them based on fear.

Sorry to repeat myself, but again: How is that **effect** different from a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:02:50
Why the repost?
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:13:51
This does not mitigate the described risk of a chain split. You describe a hard fork scenario where old outdated software forks itself of the network with &gt;50% hash rate. We want to avoid the risks associated with hard forks especially when we don't have the majority of hash power behind us. Currently just over 25% of miners are signalling Segwit support. Do you want 40minutes blocktimes and attacks from the 75% of hash power? This is what you will get if you split without hashrate majority. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:28:37
This is why we need hashrate majority. Otherwise old nodes won't reorg to the "right" chain. 
Also I would argue that there are enough actors that would happily pay for a (few) lost block(s) just to cause a split and hurt bitcoin. We shouldn't take that risk. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:07:59


You are right. I missed the constraint **for each chain**.
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:45:55
They wouldn't know if their chain has malicious blocks because they are not updated. If we could magically update all the nodes we wouldn't have the situation we are in right now. 
Ask the miners why they are not switching. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:01:20
I find this hard to believe, what kind of sources do you have? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:47:12
If you create a transaction that tries to spend one of those *anyonecanspend* transactions valid to non-Segwit miners (e.g. old nodes) they will happily continue to build on it. At the same time this transaction would be invalid to Segwit miners because they could verify you are actually not allowed to spend it. This would render the block invalid on the Segwit chain but valid on the old chain. Thus the split. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:24:33
Exactly. The more hashrate behind Segwit, the faster the resolve.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:35:56
What are the benefits in comparison to a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:02:47
Great Idea. It seems there has been a massive increase of ad hominems and "us vs them"-arguments in this sub despite the ongoing moderation efforts. Pseudonymous BIP would help in this regard.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:48:28
If you activate SegWit without hashpower, you risk a chain split. This is not about a single miner, single node or a single user. This is about the majority of hashpower not upgrading to SegWit-compatible clients.

Nodes can be added and faked easily in huge numbers.
The economic impact is probably more important than the node count.
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:25:05
UASF had only minority support, Bitcoin Classic had a larger share of full nodes once.
**In summary: 13% of nodes, 5% of "weighted economic community", ~0% hashrate.**
50% of Core developers were in favour though.

A miner that does not upgrade is not attacking, although he will continue to build on the chain that resulted from somebody else's one-time, one-block "attack".
Changing PoW will cause even more problems.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:41:46
Let's assume:
- We have 1MB blocks right now
- We have on average 800 "real-use/non-spam" tx in the mempool per block
- These tx are sorted by fee, the last non-spam tx with the lowest fee is called CHEAPEST_REAL_TX
- A tx is 1KB in size and including 800 tx in a block creates a 800kb block
- This leaves 200KB "unused" block space
- Adding spam transactions that have fewer fees than CHEAPEST_REAL_TX does not affect the inclusion of "non-spam" tx that pay same or more.
- Now an attacker wants to affect inclusion of CHEAPEST_REAL_TX by adding a spam-tx with higher fees than CHEAPEST_REAL_TX
- CHEAPEST_REAL_TX is now at position 801 in the queue, but will still be included in the block
- In order to move CHEAPEST_REAL_TX out of the block (and force it to pay higher fees), an attackers needs to move it to position 1001 by adding 200 transactions that all pay more than CHEAPEST_REAL_TX. The cost of displacing a real tx is 200*CHEAPEST_REAL_TX_FEE.
Now imagine we have 2MB blocks and still 800KB of "real demand". The cost of displacing "real tx" is now (2000-800) =&gt; 1200*CHEAPEST_REAL_TX_FEE, making it significantly more expensive for someone to carry out that "attack".
Of course miners could collude and spam the blocks themselves, since they would earn the fees themselves, making the attack cheaper.
If transactions are included at no costs, there is no cost difference in spamming small or large blocks (filling up remaining "unused" space costs nothing).
Once blocks tend to get full and you a have a fee competition, larger blocks are more difficult (=&gt; more expensive) to spam.

If you prioritise decentralisation above all else you should argue for a blocksize decrease. A decentralised coin that nobody uses is useless.

Ah, the Bitcoin civil war, my guilty pleasure. 
**TLDR UASF was a mess (and so was S2X). UASF was a minority movement and never exceeded 13% node count, but a minority movement shouldn't be able to significantly alter Bitcoin's future.**
*Edit: Sorry for the word vomit, skip to TLDR at the bottom if you are looking for a summary.*
The Bitcoin community 2015-2017.
People are engaging in heated debates regarding possible blocksize increases for the last 2 years, and although multiple, popular Core developers support, propose and even agree to specific blocksize increases, no increase is ever released in Core. The community is stressed and tired, but surely the next Bitcoin Scaling conference will make it better.
The next conference comes and goes, the next scaling proposal is discussed and agreed upon (Segwit and 2MB HF) only to be "semi-"cancelled shortly after. Miners and devs pointing fingers at each other claiming the other party did something bad that somehow justifies not working on the whole agreement without officially declaring it to be dead. SegWit activation is still stalling, the community is still angry and desperate for a resolve. It seems unlikely that miners and devs will reach consensus anytime soon.
**The introduction of S2X and UASF**
UASF was introduced in March 2017 on the [mailing list]( because


It was argued  by that UASF could trigger Segwit


The [FAQ]( explicitly warned 


Note how at that point in time, UASF aimed to represent the **economic majority**.
Instead, several companies started to sign the [New York Agreement]( (or Segwit2X) instead. At the time it claimed to represent
- &gt; 58 companies, including 14 exchanges
- &gt; 5 billion USD of monthly transaction 
- &gt; 80% of hashing power
- &gt; 20 million bitcoin wallets
In comparison, UASF had little to no support from economic actors.
**The fight is on**
Unable to secure support from the **economic majority** (5%, i.e. companies that accept Bitcoin or run exchanges/wallets), **node count** (~2%) or **hashrate** (0%), the narratives changed:
- **Companies are now bad** for Bitcoin because they collude in **"backroom deals"** and prepare **"corporate overtake"** of Bitcoin (note that this happened in an atmosphere where miners and Core devs continued to fail to produce a viable solution)
- UASF is now not only about activating Segwit but **taking a stance against evil companies**
- The economic majority is now about **running "full nodes"** instead of companies/exchanges/wallets. The users are now finally in control. After years of helplessly watching miners and core devs arguing and getting nowhere, finally the users have a say. Finally.
It's difficult to imagine that now, but before Layer 2 scaling, **back in the day, most were actually in favour of a blocksize increase**. It was just a matter of "how" to do it best, not "if at all". Adam Back proposed an increase to 8MB in 2019, nullc added dynamic block sizes to Core's roadmap and BlueMatt and LukeJr were working on a Segwit+2MB proposal for Core.
But since evil companies and evil miners are now in favour of a blocksize increase by pushing S2X, surely those that support them must be evil as well. Soon, fights broke out between SegWit+2MB (HKA) and SegWit+2MB (S2X) proponents.
A website called "nob2x.org" emerged to prove that the "economic majority" is actually against S2X. Unfortunately, they listed several companies that **weren't explicitly in favour of S2X as being against S2X**, e.g. KeepKey for example:


This is when the spam of UASF node counts and hats started. **UASF node count continued to rise but never exceeded 13%.** Many suspected those nodes to be either fake or run in the cloud. People cite "almost 15%" as a clear sign of a significant "grassroot movement". In comparison, **Bitcoin Classic and ABC had 34% and 27% at their highest peak.**
**The only metric in which UASF gained any significant support from any group at all at any point in time was support by Core developers. ~50% were in favour of UASF while all of them were against S2X.**
Eventually BIP91 locked in SegWit which in turn defused the UASF threat of splitting the chain.
SegWit2X is cancelled and still shits the bed upon activation.
People realize that they were lucky that SegWit2X didn't actually activate and you probably should have a competent dev team and enough time to prepare a fork properly.
In the end, UASF's goal was achieved (i.e. SegWit activation without blocksize increase) despite its activation (BIP148) having no effect (BIP91 locked in SegWit before). (You have to ask miners if the threat of UASF or the S2X bribe was the driving force.) This led people to become UASF supporters "in hindsight":
**Wearing a UASF hat then meant: "I support threatening a minority chain split in order to force activation of SegWit."**
**Wearing a UASF hat now means: "I support Core. Also: Users should have more say than 'companies' in the strategic development of Bitcoin".** 
It is difficult to assess the UASF support in numbers at that time, especially with regard to the number of people supporting UASF without running a corresponding node.
But it is important to note that UASF did not have any significant support on any known metric and no majority in any metric at any time during the "war". It only exceeded S2X support metrics' for "support by Core developers".
This creates a difficult situation for UASF supporters which claim that UASF is the one and only cause for Segwit activation:
**Either a minority movement of nodes or 50% of Bitcoin Core devs is sufficient to significantly alter Bitcoin's future against the wishes of the community.**
The easiest escape from this dilemma is to claim that UASF actually had overwhelming support, but the numbers simply don't support that.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:03:32

I agree, the economic impact was actually the start of UASF (before the hats). 
But right now Segwit2X seems to have more economic support than UASF ever had; add a few thousand (real) nodes and it surpasses UASF in every support measure.

This is probably the first time that supporters of a certain BIP are relieved that its activation has no effect.
Not sure if **threats of chain splits** are the way we want to push for changes though. Especially if people will be less afraid of them after the Bitcoin Cash fork. 
Also, all these spam posts about running BIP148 will just cause more spam posts about running SegWit2X in the upcoming weeks.

This is not very helpful once different nodes enforce different rules, which is kind of the situation we are facing right now.
The question at hand is, how can rules in the Bitcoin network change?
If your answer is "they can't" you don't need to employ nodes in your argument.
If your answer includes "x% or y numbers of nodes" then fake nodes would be able to change the rules.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:04:52


This is a bit of an understatement.
At &gt;85% you can't really avoid a hard-fork. It you are left with &lt;15% you want to hard-fork because of PoW change or difficulty reset.
There is no option to ignore the economic majority. (Which was UASF's original motivation btw).

[According]( to Frogolocalypse, you start out with a given set of rules which are set in stone. You either accept them or not. If you do, you are part of the network, if you don't you are not - doesn't matter if you are in the majority or not:


This is the "you are either with us or against us" mentality.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:57:10






If you consider UASF a success you should take its support levels into account when considering Segwit2X. I assumed you do. If you don't, please ignore that part.


"Super-majority" of what?
90% of hashrate **is super-majority of hashrate**.
If you are talking about a combined voting (mixing hashrate, developers, nodes and businesses) you need to define who gets how much voting power and why.
You could argue that 1% of nodes should have the same voting power as 1% of hashrate. But is that "fair"? You can easily add 100 nodes (1%) to the network at no costs - getting 60.000 THs (1%) of hashrate is expensive.


This is very dangerous. If you only rely on nodes for this, an attacker could just spend a few hundred bucks and spawn 10.000 new nodes that would not reject those blocks, winning the "predominance".
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:08:03
It gets complicated if you change the model on how to reach consensus every time the proposal changes.
Either economic players have a strong vote in deciding on proposals or they don't.
Support by userbase is neither provable nor quantifiable and is the weakest measurement of support we got.

see dedicated reply.


Consensus has no meaning in Bitcoin unless you are talking about the ordering of blocks. There is no process in Bitcoin to achieve consensus on rule changes. The only non-gameable metric we have is hashrate.


I agree.


I agree. Although this is probably more of an issue for the chain with less hashrate.


I am conflicted about that one but I see how it can be seen as an issue.


Is there a particular feature you are missing?


Just started to skim over it but so far I don't see how that study supports the claim that S2X will lead to significantly more centralization than S1X. S2X has 4MB blocks on average which are considered safe. Are you worried that there will be so many "pathological" 8MB blocks that the "4MB is safe" statement shouldn't be applied?


Community consists of users, developers, miners and businesses.
- Users: Support by userbase is not provable nor measurable but at least there is "some" support judging by user comments.
- Developers: No support by Core **at all**. Although I am not sure if this is also the result of the failed Hong Kong agreement and Core devs claiming to not have been invited.
- Miners: Super-majority 90% support. Without them signing NYA we wouldn't have Segwit1X right now.
- Businesses: Bitpay, Coinbase and Shapeshift and 80+ other businesses signed the NYA. They are massively significant actors in the Bitcoin space and responsible for the most of the commercial Bitcoin adoption we see today.

Regarding storage:


Not sure why you would want to backup your HA failover and your snapshots and your RAID.
But anyway, this sounds like a very specific business use case and hopefully this company has a revenue model that will pay for these very specific requirements.
I don't see how this can be applied as a general argument for "Segwit good, Segwit2X bad". Unless you explain how this relates to nodes run by "non-company" users or how the increase in costs is justified at S1X levels but not at S2X levels.

Just to be clear:
"to spam" =&gt; "adding a tx to the pool with the only goal to make it more expensive for others to get tx in a block"
"more difficult" =&gt; "more expensive"
If you are an attacker and your actions don't affect the tx fees of "regular uses" I wouldn't consider this spam.


Once blocks are full and real tx compete with spam tx for block space it gets more expensive for larger blocks.
Would you agree in my "one-block" example without temporal dimensions that one larger block is more expensive to spam, assuming similar demand (e.g. 2MB vs 1MB blocks at 800KB demand)?
If so, how does this change over multiple blocks? Like you said, CHEAPEST_REAL_TX_FEE will raise over time which will make it even more expensive for the attacker to keep up the attack.
The important metric is how much space does the attacker need to occupy with spam in order to displace a real tx. The more space there is the more fees the attacker has to spend. Bigger blocks provide more space (assuming real demand is unchanged). Thus it is more difficult (=&gt; expensive) for the attacker to spam larger blocks (=&gt; force others to pay higher fees).

You can't seriously use that thread to argue that a majority of big blockers are fine with $20K nodes. That is just ridiculous.

He said that "in the near future [...] [LN] improves efficiency of blockchain usage [...] reducing 1 MB block usage to ~10k." This is the total block size, including **all** settlement transactions for LN.

Segwit would probably be safe because it had a 95% activation requirement.
But BIP148 introduced a new rule that treated all blocks that did not signal for Segwit as invalid - starting Aug 1st. Since the majority of miners did not signal for Segwit at the time, their blocks would have been considered invalid by BIP148 clients. You end up with two chains.

Consensus in the Byzantine general sense is determined by miners using PoW.
Consensus in the common sense is not achievable anymore in the Bitcoin community, because
- the "community" is too large to achieve unanimity
- there is no "consensus" about the decision rule that defines consensus (e.g. majority, super-majority, 99%, ...)
- all methods currently in use to gauge "community" support are vulnerable to fake votes
So we end up with sockpuppets, astro-turfing, Twitter polls, Reddit post spam and in the end a  chain-split that lets the free market decide.

Why does it have to be an either/or? Why does it have to be a their side or our side?
I don't have an issue with bigger blocks as long as there is enough time to prepare the HF and the blocksize does not increase centralization significantly.
Opening a LN channel for 350 million users with SegWit at 7tps takes more than 1.5 years (assuming you won't use the blockchain for anything else and never settle in that time). LN needs bigger blocks.

Overestimating your own position in a negotiation is dangerous.
If you ignore Segwit2X/NYA's effects in activating Segwit you are arguing that
- a minority of users with
- a minority of nodes and
- a minority of economic actors and
- a minority of hashrate
was able to coerce the miners into doing something that they did not want to.
This is not true and this is not what happened. Again, we wouldn't have Segwit right now without BIP148 but we also wouldn't have Segwit right now without Segwit2X.
Segwit2X right now has
- a minority of users with
- a minority of nodes and
- **significant support by economic actors** and
- **a near unanimous super-majority of hashrate**
There was a point - not too long ago - where UASF claimed to represent the economic majority. It failed to do so.
Segwit2X represents a **significant part** of the ecosystem. You can't ignore that.
Of course you can rightfully claim that Segwit2X is rushed (borderline reckless in my opinion) and that it is not developed by Core (which is the most experienced and capable dev team in the space in my opinion).
But let's not pretend that Segwit2X is only wanted by a few individuals in a backdoor meeting and that another minority UASF will be enough to stop it. It will hard-fork anyway and you can't hinder people from forking. Like you said


People buying the chain will determine what Bitcoin is, not a "consensus" that we can't agree on how to define, reach and measure. 


Miners can spin up as many full nodes as they want. So you end up having 20.000 Segwit2X nodes and 10.000 Core nodes, so what? There is no "illegitimate" change to the Bitcoin system because it is permissionless.
We should get used to groups forking off, let the free markets decide. In the meantime we get more experienced in handling hard-forks so they might be not as scary anymore in the future for protocol upgrades.

@_date: 2017-08-09 16:54:02


Which measure do you use to back the claim that Segwit2X has huge opposition, but UASF didn't?
Segwit2X has more support than UASF in every category except node count (which can easily be changed by miners by just spinning up a few thousand extra nodes).
If you are saying that UASF has more "r/bitcoin" support than Segwit2X, than I'd argue that this is probably because Segwit2X is a compromise and people that agree to compromises are probably less prone to engage in fights and trolling in this sub. As a result they would be less visible which might skew our impressions.

**Bitcoin 2X:** Not-Core, hard-fork, rushed
**Bitcoin Core:** Core, soft-fork, planned
In the end, it doesn't really matter. There is no voting besides PoW. The only way to gauge "community" support is releasing the fork and to see which one has higher value on the free market.

Segwit2X is a hard-fork. You don't need to do anything to ignore it. But it might make sense for the legacy chain to prepare its own hard-fork to change PoW and reset difficulty, should Segwit2x achieve &gt;85% hashrate. (Currently at 90%)

Your willingness to fight is admirable. I just think that it might be better directed at "enemies" outside of the Bitcoin community. And maybe consider for a second that there might be quite a few moderate Bitcoiners out there that are not active in these discussions. People with extreme opinions are more likely to express them. Maybe the extremists are the outliers and there is a silent, moderate majority? Who knows.
Neither of us should claim to speak for "the majority", "the users" or "the true bitcoiners". At the same time we shouldn't call those with different opinions "in the minority","enemies" or "no true bitcoiners".

Regarding bandwidth:
Which statement are you refering to in the [video]( Is it that larger blocks have a higher risk of being orphaned?
Hasn't this also been covered in the infamous Cornell study and was considered to be safe at 4MB (Segwit2X) levels?
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:37:00
Thanks for the clarification.
I have to run the numbers for that scenario but I would assume that download bandwidth is probably not the issue in that scenario (you'd need only 0.1Mbps for 8MB blocks - otherwise you'd lag behind for the duration of the attack). Halving the number of connected peers would  also bring your upload bandwidth back to levels "before the attack".
The pathological 8MB blocks would also contain only very few transactions in comparison to regular blocks. An attacker would have to spend very high fees for miners in order to make up for the "missing" transactions.
Not saying it is impossible, but there are probably other attack vectors that are more likely.

Support for SegWit2X is at ~93% now. Even if every miner that signalled SegWit before NYA is actually against a hard-fork (which is quite unlikely) they still have ~60%.

@_date: 2017-08-01 23:58:03


Unfortunately we don't have a process to give them a vote that can't be easily faked. But we do have such a process for miners - PoW.
How about we let transactions vote for proposals with their fees? Miners mine blocks that signal for certain proposals. A transaction signalling for a certain proposal can only be mined in a block that also signals that same proposal.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:03:55
If you think that UASF single-handedly changed consensus without node, hashrate, developer or user majority, then you should assume that Segwit2X can do the same.

The probability to send ~0.01 BTC has indeed increased from ~5% (Feb) to ~%10. (June). But the area around 0.01 BTC is also the one that saw the largest improvement between Feb and June.

50% for **any two random nodes anywhere in the LN** is already quite impressive. 
**The number increased to 70%** if you exclude start/endNodes that don't have big enough channels to begin with. See the updated graph [here](
@_date: 2018-06-20 10:12:13
[It's ~70%](
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:17:19
Edit 
**This shows the probability for a successful payment between random nodes (i.e. even those that don't have enough funds in the first place).**
**If you are looking for the probability that at least one route exists between nodes with sufficient funds, look [here](
Edit 
I removed the updated version of the second graph cause it led to too much confusion. It showed what percentage of routes between two sufficiently funded nodes support the routing of a certain payment. Many people understood it as the probability that at least one sufficiently funded route exists. I have therefore removed the updated version of the second graph and will post a new graph showing what people expected to see.
**[~~Here's an updated version of the second graph~~]( ~~that only considers start- and end-nodes that have at least one channel that is big enough to route the payment (i.e. size is &gt;= 2*paymentSize).~~
~~If you would select a random route between those node, the probability to successfully spend a coffee between these nodes is ~70% vs. ~50%.~~
~~Please note that the y-axis is now linear instead of logarithmic to remove focus on the lower end probabilities.~~
First graph shows absolute number of possible routes. This number grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
Second graph shows the probability for a successful route of a certain amount of BTC. Capacities along the route must be at least as large as twice the amount to be routed (i.e. the model assumes the capacity is split evenly across the two parties).
The probability considers all paths amongst two peers and reports the share of paths with enough capacities vs all paths.
What is interesting to note is that although the number of channel has increased across all channel sizes (first graph) the relative distribution has not changed too much (second graph).
**The probability to successfully pay for a coffee (\~0.0004 BTC) across two random peers along the LN is currently \~48%.**
Please note that this includes most of those channels that were only set up to try out LN without putting enough money into their channels. The probability for a coffee payment towards a LN connected merchant should be higher. 
Data sources, etc. are the same as in my other [statistic posts](
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:55:04
This probably depends on what you mean by "more difficult" and "to spam" in this particular context.
Usually "more difficult" means "more expensive" and "to spam" means "filling the mempool in a way it significantly increases the transaction fees for 'regular' uses".
As long as fees are low and blocks aren't full, it won't significantly increase the transaction fees for 'regular' uses. As such there is no "spam" up until blocks start to get full.

@_date: 2018-06-18 09:12:34


LN exchanges transactions directly peer-to-peer without the blockchain. Without an internet connection or the other peer being online, there is no direct peer-to-peer connection. This makes exchanging Bitcoin transaction via LN impossible in a "cold storage" scenario.
Paper/hardware wallets are cold storage in a sense that you can receive coins but you need to be online to spend them. A LN wallets needs to be online to be spent from as well, but it also needs to be online in order to receive.
A disconnected LN wallet state is "frozen" (is that even colder? :-) - it balance can't change in either direction.
Of course you could turn off your LN device(phone)/disconnect it from the Internet. You could also print out the latest channel state on a piece of paper (although I'm not sure if LN wallets offer this).
It should be clear that this disables further updates to the channel. You (or a watchtower) would also need to monitor the blockchain for a fraudulent spent of that channel.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:30:32
Without NYA, BIP148 would have forked off the main chain on Aug 1st. Depending on how many miners would have switched, different outcomes were possible:
- Majority of miners switched: BIP148 would activate SegWit on its own chain and orphan/replace the main chain.
- more than 12% of miners switched: BIP148 would activate SegWit on its own chain and keep on surviving as a minority chain. Main chain unaffected.
- less than 12% of miners switched: BIP148 would fail to activate SegWit on its own chain.
Based on my impression, it was very unlikely that BIP148 even got enough hashpower to activate SegWit on its own chain, less own enough to orphan the main chain.

@_date: 2018-06-26 15:14:28
Generally I would assume that the burden of proof is on the claimant, but here is my feedback:
1) I require channel funding to be at least twice the payment size, assuming that on average the balance is split equally. Uneven splits (like 49:51 or 25:75) would make a particular payment fail in one direction but would enable a larger payment to succeed in the other direction. What multiple of the payment size would you find reasonable?
2) People are already misinterpreting the results in ways I did not intend to. While adding more parameters will probably make the model more predictive, the increased complexity and it's associated potential misuse makes me cautious of doing so. Probably safer to keep this model simple and refer to its results as an upper limit probability.
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:14:50


No, it doesn't. The channel will only be eventually closed if either party deliberately choses to. The timeout period gives the other party enough time to counter with a more recent penalty transaction. 
**It is not an "automatic" timeout.**

Yes. I think this is where a lot of the uncertainty comes from. 
 explicitly states that node operators should stop running BIP-148 nodes if there is not enough economic support.
But this is easier said than done. Node operators would have to monitor and measure the economic majority, come to the same conclusion and collaborate on their decision to cause a split or not.

Worst case scenario is probably a chain split with hashrate attacks, increased block times, increased difficulty adjustments, PoW change, ...
This can be mitigated by getting the **economic and hashrate majority** on board with UASF.
Triggering UASF with hashrate minority will almost definitely lead to a chain split.
UASF is basically a way to reduce the 95% hashrate requirement of SegWit down to more reasonable levels (e.g. 75%). It does not make the hashrate requirement obsolete.
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:37:30
I think argues that BitPay's lack of knowledge renders them unable to provide meaningful criticism with regard to BIP148.
Based on how often "hard fork" is used in the "chain split" sense, I would just assume a simple slip of the tongue.

When we are talking about chain splits we are always talking about hashrate, i.e. miners. The distinction between hard-/soft-forks makes sense when you consider user nodes that need updating, not so much miners.
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:21:08
Exactly. What matters is not your actual support for a chain when trading these tokens but your perceived chances of their success. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:06:46
I see. Is there something wrong with my calculation?
    UASF duration = 2017-11-15 - 2017-08-01 ~  3.5 month * 30 days/month = 105 days = 151.200 minutes
    min. number of blocks for activation BIP9: 2016
    max. minutes per block: 151200/2016 = 75min/block
    min. hashrate percentage: 100/75*10 = 13.33%
I would argue that even with 14% remaining hashrate you could activate SegWit within UASF time constraints (assuming perfect conditions otherwise).
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:05:14
Orphaning the blocks you don't like. Bam. 100% agree with you.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:53:34
I would wait for the UASF FAQ to clear up on the different levels of support one can offer for UASF. 
Personally, I think it is not in the spirit of decentralization to run multiple nodes as an individual. It's already great you run a single node, but it makes it difficult to draw the line when somebody asks to spin up multiple machines in the cloud or to start up multiple fake advertising nodes.
I also doubt the effect additional UASF nodes have on exerting pressure on miners as long as the functionality/profitability of the non-UASF network is not affected.
This is what I meant by switching vs. adding.
As long as we don't have an idea about the position of the economic majority regarding UASF you can't do much more than signalling interest using the user agent string ("uacomment", see FAQ).
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:43:54


This sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:15:35


It activates around 1 hour after midnight, August 1st and starts to consider all blocks as invalid that do not signal SegWit support. It doesn't care about number of nodes or hashrate.
Edit: Sorry, I have no idea what you are talking about .-)
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:10:44
It's very difficult to predict the dynamics in a hashrate war. The only thing that is certain - the more hashrate the better are your chances. Adding a hashrate majority as a requirement helps with that.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:03:05
I think the recommendation is you as a node operator should monitor the economic majority. If the economic majority is not in favour of UASF shortly before activation, you are expected to drop UASF in order to prevent a split.
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:45:34
I agree. In a project of this size, with people's money on the table, you can't expect to reach 95% agreement.
But we still don't know how to do an accurate, fair, anonymous and practical vote without miners.
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:34:59


Why? They will mine whatever coin has compatible PoW. Exchanges don't care about the value of a coin, they care about the demand of trading it (see ETC/ETH).
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:36:06


You can block it by adding an extra rule that needs to be enforced by most miners. This would make most **old blocks invalid to new nodes** and **new blocks valid to old nodes**. So yes, this could be fixed with a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:00:12
UASF is a method to reduce the SegWit activation requirements. Without majority hashrate support it will create a serious chain split. With majority hashrate it will force SegWit activation. 
UASF is short for **"User Activated Soft Fork"**. Its specification is described [here](
It tries to force the activation of SegWit which is currently (~30%) unable to reach the required activation threshold (95%).
Between August 1st and November 15th, UASF nodes will consider all blocks invalid that do not explicitly signal support for SegWit, thus creating a fork. Within that fork, support for SegWit will be 100% which in turn triggers the activation threshold of SegWit (95%).
**Its activation only depends on the date, not on a minimum number of nodes or hashrate.**
It is often compared to BIP-16 (P2SH) which was also activated using a flag day (~user activated). BIP-16 however had a minimum hashrate requirement (~55%) which acts as  a sort of chain split protection. BIP-148 (UASF) does not have this protection and will most likely result in a chain split (unless a majority of the hashrate supports it).
A chain split in turn will suffer from decreased hashrate, increased block times, increased hash rate attacks, increased orphan rates, PoW change and a price crash.

Yes I realized that as well. Do you have a suggestion for a better title?
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:33:23
Yes. UASF achieves this by forking off the regular (non-UASF) network. The UASF fork will only see blocks signalling SegWit which will trigger the required amount of 1916 blocks during the last 2016 blocks (95%) with unanimous 100% support.
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:09:21
Yeah. It doesn't get easier the more people are involved (and money of course). 95% agreement also means 5% get veto power.
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:10:25


I did not judge any of the proposals - I just argued that they are two different ones which may contribute to the confusion. 


We probably want to know the chances of a successful split before we actually split, not afterwards.


A split without hashrate majority will lead to significantly reduced hashrate, increased block times, increased back log, increased confirmation times, makes hashrate attacks more attractive, might make PoW change necessary and will most likely crash the market value.  
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:10:05
Not sure about your recommendation of PoW change, but I agree about the rest :-)

Chicken-and-egg, this means businesses should not adopt UASF right now until it's in the majority.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:55:52
Good example to show that "vote" in the context of UASF is basically meaningless - and everybody has a different idea of what that means.
I think one "idea" was to count the trading volume of one exchange as some form of "weight" for its vote, but again - not an objective measurement (e.g. what about trading fees, etc...)
The UASF support statements so far list one exchange as one vote - not assigning any weights at all.
Once you have at least the mining majority behind SegWit, economic majority do
@_date: 2017-04-12 11:28:18
I like the LotR memes - can we make this mandatory for showing BIP-148/UASF support?
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:35:36
The extremes would be
- hashrate majority without economy
- economic majority without blocks
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:32:16


The idea would be to trade measurable hashrate against difficult to measure economic votes.
    SegWit = 95% quantifiable hashrate
    USAF+ = &gt;50% quantifiable hashrate +  fuzzy economic votes
If you are certain you can't even get 50% miners on board you are going to have a bad time anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:58:13
When you talk about risks of chain splits you need to consider miners. HF/SF is a terminology that mostly helps when you consider regular nodes (i.e. how do old nodes handle new blocks).
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:24:05
What are the actual numbers excluding miners?
Considering the *"whole"* economic majority, only **38% signal support**. Even when you count those that don't support SegWit but are prepared to face the consequences ("ready") you get **only 72%**. This is nowhere near almost unanimous.
Not sure about the numbers without the miners, could you provide them?
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:48:34
Is this how statement like this are being processed? (Top to bottom)
- They are not affected by UASF
- so, they don't have to do anything to be ready

- so, they signal support
- so, they will fork upon UASF activation
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:27:24
Thanks. I think this was a misunderstanding on my part.
The issue at hand is basically finding a point in time that uses
- ```GetMedianTimePast```to mark a (min) date in epoch time 
- blockheight to find the next block after a difficulty readjustment
If I remember correctly BIP9 discourages this.

It probably makes sense to not being able to "commit" to SegWit and Extensions blocks at the same time. But how does that follow from the ASICBoost fix. In other words:
Why can't ASICBoost fix use constant A, SegWit uses S, Extension Blocks uses E with A != S != E?
AFAIK there is nothing magical about these constants, you just need to have these bytes fixed in order to break covert ASICBoost usage.
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:09:58

**BIP-148 is a flag day fork. It does not depend on node numbers or mining hashrate.** As such there is no Sybill attack involved. 
However, **the call to action** that everybody should run nodes in order to increase the *[chances, safety, core involvement]* of UASF **is vulnerable to Sybill attacks**. Node counts are simply too easy to fake. You want a few thousand BIP148 nodes? Grab a few hundred bucks and spin them up on AWS EC2, distributed around the world at will.
**Add the mining majority requirements (as BIP-16 did) and you at least know that a minimum amount of PoW is involved and the chain split risk is reduced.**
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:30:15
If somebody would control the hashrate majority you are going to have a bad time in Bitcoinland anyways - USAF or not.
Exchanges (as everybody else) follow the money, if users have demand for Whatever-Coin, exchanges have an incentive to offer them.
A ViaBTC exchange would be counted as "one vote" in the "economic majority poll" - not much damage they could do in this regard.

The "forking" that I mentioned in the last post is a given - there is no if. It does not depend on node or hashrate distribution.

You might be confusing UASF (BIP-148) with SegWit (BIP-141). In UASF there are no non-SegWit blocks. BIP-148 makes that explicit: **Non-SegWit blocks will be rejected**:


See: 
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:33:22


If this happens the uncertainty in the ecosystem probably hinders new miners from investing money and covering the lost hashrate.


This also applies to exchanges. It will be difficult to convince exchanges to drop support for the regular/non-USAF chain.
As long as miners are able to receive transactions and sell their blocks they have little incentive to switch.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:39:31
PoW change is your last resort defense measure if you are suffering from hashrate attacks. ("Evil" miners reorg or orphaning your blocks). By changing your PoW you change the problem that their mining rigs are optimized to solve. In turn they can't use it anymore to mine/change your chain.
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:08:56
Exactly. We should have something in RFC 2119 terms, example:
After UASF activation, supporting companies or individuals **MUST** only run nodes that follow the specification defined at BIP-148. They **MUST NOT** run any nodes that remain on the regular (non-UASF) chain.
Companies or individuals that are "ready" **MUST** run nodes that follow the specification defined at BIP-148. They **MAY** run additional nodes that still support the regular (non-UASF) chain although this is not in the spirit of the BIP and not recommended.
*I actually have no clue what that means*

Ah, good point. Thanks.
Yes, you could have 50% in the USAF chain with twenty-minute blocks and still have the same amount of transactions processed per time as before. Assuming immediate SegWit activation after 2016 blocks, 100% SegWit transactions and perfect conditions otherwise (no hashrate attacks, ...). You would still suffer from reduced transactions though in the time SegWit has been locked in but not activated yet (2016 blocks).
Not sure if I get your second question right. The difficulty readjustment is based on the number of blocks, not the amount of transactions. Larger SegWit blocks wouldn't have an effect in that regard.

USAF is "blind". It doesn't care about nodes or hashrate. USAF starts at August 1st and ends at November 15th. BIP-16 was flag day activated as well but had chain split protection which BIP-148 lacks.

BIP-148 doesn't care for support, the UASF FAQ requires an "economic majority".
Nobody knows
- what "economic majority" exactly means
- how it can be measured
- who we should trust to know that it has been reached
I am all in for "unanimous" support and all, but it is impossible to get not only with the miners but especially with the exchanges, cause they lose money in not trading in between the chain splits. 


You are talking about "near unanimous" support and "economic supermajority". According to the FAQ UASF is fine with simple majority.
I think a majority of miners is more important than an economic supermajority. Not sure which one is easier to achieve.

@_date: 2017-04-13 18:18:36
Thanks for checking the numbers.


We could probably discuss why being "ready" for SegWit does not mean "supporting" SegWit, but even if you would treat all "ready" votes as "support" votes:  **You can't claim 77% is almost unanimous support.**
Unanimous support is 100%, 77% is not *almost* 100%.
Maybe you could consider the term *super majority* as a replacement?
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:26:27
Always a good idea to gather more information. I doubt that this is much more resistant to sybil-attacks than other attempts but the effort is much appreciated!
Your main interest seems to be: **"Do you support BIP-148?"**, presumable to use that information to predict the probability of a successful fork/split.
Unfortunately, neither the BIP nor the FAQ define what it means to **support** it. I asked about it [here](
It might be
- I think it's ok to take higher (chain split) risks in order to end this stallmate
- I will run a node that follows BIP-148 once the software is ready
- I will stop running other nodes that don't follow BIP-148
- I will consider the UASF chain the valid one as long as it has some minimum requirements (min. hashrate, min. nodes, min. exchanges, ...)
- I will consider the UASF chain the valid one no matter what.
- ...
This confusion has apparently led to a discussion about what it means that Trezor is *"supporting"* BIP-148 [here]( They will **not fork off** to the UASF chain as BIP-148 suggest but instead will provide nodes that will **support both chains**. Their *support level* has been reduced from "Support" to "Ready" on 
Miners don't care if there is another Litecoin, Dogecoin or UASFCoin network. Miners care if they can't use the existing Bitcoin network anymore for profitable operations.

I agree. I worry that if UASF successfully activates on Litecoin *with hashrate majority* (and thus probably no chain split), people will yell that it's now safe to do it in Bitcoin - ignoring the missing hashrate and the increased chain split risk.
Every UASF supporter should decide between
- adding hashrate majority as a requirement to UASF (like BIP-16)
- prepare for a chain split, hashrate attacks, PoW change
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:56:37
They probably mean "hard fork" in a sense of "serious fork" as a synonym for "chain split".
Maybe they also used it in this sense:


@_date: 2017-04-09 12:08:08


What do you mean by attack? What sources do you have? You link to ViaBTC raising money and Bitfinex having issues with Wells Fargo.

How much hashrate would Segwit have if BU miners would switch? 
@_date: 2017-04-14 11:14:42
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:24:03




**No**, and we seem to have a very different understanding of the documents:
UASF mailing-list:
    non-upgraded miners' blocks will not be orphaned
   
    Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected


**No**, AFAIR even SegWit allows miners to continue mining non-SegWit blocks. A fork only occurs once a malicious miner introduces a not-valid SegWit block. **There is no scheduled fork within SegWit (BIP141), but there is in BIP148.** 




**No**, BIP141 (SegWit) is a soft-fork and has 95% consensus requirement - the **chain split risk is very low**, BIP148 (UASF) does not state any hashrate requirement - as such the **chain split risk depends on the unknown hashrate**.
Regarding the further topics: Please think of yourself as a BIP148 node operator. UASF FAQ asks of you to
- monitor the economic network
- measure and assess the economic majority
- shutdown your BIP148 node at some time if economic majority has not been reached
UASF FAQ asks you to do this to **prevent a chain split**. This is **your and every node operator's responsibility**. This only works if all BIP148 participants collaborate and act in unison. How do they communicate? How do they agree on when to go through or not?
If you seriously say that this is clear and needs no further clarification, then **please** describe how you would perform these tasks - because it's not clear and we should add them to the UASF FAQ.
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:59:47


I agree that we should be careful what kind of discussion should end up in a BIP.
However, **BIP-001 makes it mandatory to describe at least incompatibilities and their severity:**  


**According to BIP-148** - which forks off every other node that does not comply - **there are no backward incompatibilities.** At. All. None.
This is their section about incompatibilities:


@_date: 2017-04-10 13:41:52
UASF will lead to a chain split unless it has hashrate majority.


Yeah, that would be nice.
At the same time you need to deal with reduced hashrate, increased block times, increased difficulty readjustment period, orphaned blocks, PoW change and a huge crash in exchange value.
That's not so nice.
But that is easy to avoid, just add majority hashrate as a requirement. "BIP-16/P2SH was successfully activated that way"
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:16:57
Currently there is a lot of uncertainty about BIP148/UASF:
- initial UASF proposal did not orphan blocks, BIP148 does
- unclear chain split risk
- unclear "support" levels - *"Interest", "Ready", "Support"*
- unclear activation conditions ("*economic majority*")
- unclear communication channel to signal activation
- unclear responsibility of node operators (how to monitor economic majority, when to run/shutdown nodes)
BIP148 needs at least hashrate majority in order to avoid a serious chain split.
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:08:46


Yes, this is basically the debate we had about 5% veto power vs. (near unanimous) consensus.
Unfortunately, we don't have any voting-mechanism as good as PoW that would also work for assessing the rest of the community.

Your response makes total sense and I thank you very much for your balanced view. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:31:39
Efficiency in this context is basically hashrate divided by power consumption. This means either hashrate gets higher and/or power consumption gets lower. AFAIK in the context of ASICBoost it is only power consumption that is being reduced. **This improves efficiency, but does not increase hashrate.** 
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:58:22
This. It's **dangerous** to promote node numbers that can be easily faked as an indicator for UASF safety.
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:11:58
Which suggestion are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:22:34


This is a good point. There are probably studies about the success of open-source projects depending on their governance model.
Assuming that there is a naturally occurring division in these kind of communities it should be treated even more so as an attack vector. Do you have any idea on how we could prepare against this? 
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:40:48
100% agreed. This is the UASF recommendation in question:


@_date: 2017-04-10 20:14:24


Yes, and it worked (BIP-16).
There is a lot of room between a 95%  (BIP-9) and 0% (USAF) hashrate requirement. BIP-16 made it with 55%.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:20:25
1. ASICBoost makes mining cheaper, not faster
2. They still have the same hashrate when they'd mine against segwit, they would just lose the ASICBoost benefit and in turn mine at similar profit like everybody else.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:21:59
Sounds like a matter of perspective. What would change objectively? 
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:30:25
On a side note, I always considered the term "ready" as "I don't want it but I'll roll with it if I have to" in contrast to "support" which means "I want it".
What is the difference between those terms in your interpretation?
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:10:20
Can you add an explanation of what the different kinds of support mean (e.g. Interest, Ready, Support, ...). Maybe in reference to RFC 2119 keywords?
After UASF activation, supporting companies or individuals **MUST** only run nodes that follow the specification defined at BIP-148. They **MUST NOT** run any nodes that remain on the regular (non-UASF) chain.
Companies or individuals that are "ready" **MUST** run nodes that follow the specification defined at BIP-148. They **MAY** run additional nodes that still support the regular (non-UASF) chain although this is not in the spirit of the BIP and not recommended.
*I actually have no idea what that means*
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:12:41
Sounds like The Matrix.
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:05:51
There probably won't be a quantifiable measurement of economic majority. I doubt it exists.
UASF is basically a game of chicken. The goal is not to reach a certain percentage threshold but to give miners the impression that they have more to lose than to gain by blocking SegWit.
Considering game theory it might even make sense to not being able to quantify the support precisely and use that uncertainty to cause more FUD on the miners side, establishing an irrational/unpredictable/crazy actor.
Of course this will make it difficult to signal "readiness" in between UASF supporters. This is probably why signalling UASF in the uacomment is currently more popular than actually supporting UASF (=&gt; forking off the regular chain upon activation)
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:45:21
That's the spirit. User base is done. Any idea how to split the exchanges or wallet providers?
@_date: 2017-04-11 19:31:11
Being ready for SegWit and being ready for UASF (=&gt; forking off every non-SegWit node) are very different.
@_date: 2017-04-19 09:01:57
I appreciate the effort in creating this, though I'm not sure what it exactly adds to the current discussion.
It starts with the assumption that the UASF coin will be valued significantly higher across the exchanges. This is the base of the argument presented in the slides, but it's unfortunately one of the most contentious ones. 
There is no agreement upon how the market will value the UASF chain, in fact, the current discussion about economic majority and how to assess it is at the center of the debate around UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:49:12
Again, I don't disagree. I'm just saying that a prediction market answers the question "Who do you think the majority will choose?" and not "Who do you choose?"

Not everybody will change their view based on new information, thanks for that!
Based on this discussion, if you could send a text message back in time to convince your "former self" what would you write? 
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:18:06
This is a reasonable position.
"User activated/Flag day" BIP-16/P2SH solved it by requiring hashrate majority for activation.
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:17:18




The term "economic majority" was not used in BIP148 probably because it is ill defined right now. Yet, in the discussion and the FAQ the importance of "economic majority" could not be bigger.
Even more so, "economic majority" is described as the decisive factor for a chain split in the FAQ:


For something as serious as a chain split you rely on
- node operators knowing what "economic majority" is
- node operators knowing how to measure it
- node operator to shut down their nodes when "economic majority" is not reached
I am all in for giving the users more power. **But making node operators responsible for a chain split is too much.**
It also doesn't cover the effects a lack of hashrate majority has on chain split risk.
The chain split risk could be reduced by including a hashrate majority - BIP-16 used it to introduce P2SH. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:27:08
I think I see what you are getting at. Could you provide an example that would demonstrate the worst case?

- remove reference to BIP-16 as a successful example for flag day forks as long as BIP-148 has significantly higher risks
- add discussion of potential risks and consequences of a hashrate minority chain split
- define how to measure economic majority
- make clear how node operators should monitor the economic majority
- comply to BIP-001 and describe backward incompatibilities and their severities 
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:18:29
Are you suggesting that a miner could "fake" UASF support by setting the VersionBit during the UASF + SegWit locked-in period and after SegWit would be activated switch back to Non-SegWit mode? What would the miners motivation be for this?
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:12:21
Could you be more specific? Are you considering users that run non-UASF nodes that would follow a non-UASF hashrate majority?
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:55:06
**This is a mess.** 
I think he was referring to UASF as described in the mailing list. It did not orphan non-SegWit blocks and as such did not have the increased risk of a "hard fork" (he means chain split). This was before BIP-148 made it clear that non-compliant, regular blocks will be rejected.
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:37:39
Yes, if other miners start mining on the minority chain (for good or bad reasons) it will increase the hashrate and thus reduce the difficulty readjustment period.
The probability of hashrate attack might depend heavily on the kind of hashrate distribution at the start of the chain split. At around 50%/50% both have an incentive to not lose hashrate by attacking the other chain while at same time they want to kill the other chain in order to become the stronger/surviving one.
Either way it will get dirty unless you get a hashrate majority on your side first.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:37:47
Blockstream good, Bitmain bad. Got it.
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:02:08


Since we are talking about the worst case: even after difficulty retarget you are still left with a useless chain because it doesn't help you with the attacks from the hashrate majority. Going nuclear with a PoW change and difficulty reset is the only option that would help in that regard.
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:52:05


This sounds very different from


This means you will run nodes on both sides of the fork and will provide options for the user to choose from?  
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:56:37
A prediction market does not answer: "Who do you support?" but instead "Who do you think the majority supports?"
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:04:37
Are you arguing to change BIP9's requirement from 95% down to 55%?
This won't be feasible because you'd need Core's consensus for that.
Users don't need to be as reasonable (as Core), they can go for lower requirements.
@_date: 2017-04-12 11:22:40


**No. If activated, non-SegWit blocks become invalid.** 
UASF will fork off the rest of the network that doesn't support SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:06:10
AFAIK ASICSBoost **reduces power consumption** (-&gt; more efficient mining by about 20%). This would give miners an additional profit that they **might** invest in additional hashrate, but **they don't get an increase in hashrate by simply running ASICSBoost**.
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:46:22
What is your definition of a soft-fork? 
@_date: 2017-04-09 11:48:04
I agree that we need at least the big economic players to get behind UASF (and a majority of miners) to be successful. But how do you get to the conclusion that this gets harder everyday?
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:31:29


BIP16 had a requirement of **hashrate majority**:


To judge whether or not more than 50% of hashing power supports this BIP, miners are asked to upgrade their software and put the string "/P2SH/" in the input of the coinbase transaction for blocks that they create. 


There is no such requirement in BIP148. Activation of USAF with hashrate minority will lead to a chain split.
You can't use BIP16 as an example on why the risk of sybil attacks are low at BIP148. Besides being activated at flag day, they have little in common. This is like saying: *"Jumping from a bridge is safe because somebody else did it sucessfully with a bungee rope"*. Add the bungee rope (hashrate majority) to BIP148 and you can make the comparison.
@_date: 2017-04-09 11:36:57
This happens when the discussion is about the characters of people instead of the risks and merits of proposals.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:14:02
Miners are supposed to act selfishly. This also leads to other miners wanting to level the playing field.
We should judge proposals for improvements based on their merits and risks and not on the person proposing them. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:13:06
UASF.io at least mentions the term "chain split". ~~It also doesn't use BIP-16 to give the impression all flag day (*~user activated*) forks are fine.~~
However, the risk of a chain split in the case of hashrate minority is severely downplayed, e.g.:




In short, *"Don't worry, everything will be fine. It's not you who is going to have a problem, it's the others."*
The document does not consider 
- hashrate attacks
- delayed block times
- orphan rates
- difficulty adjustment
- PoW change
- ...
There was a reason "that other user activated/flag day fork" (P2SH/BIP-16) had a hashrate majority requirement.
Also, it frequently reiterates it "requires support from the **economic majority**" without defining the term nor how it can/should be assessed.
It's very useful to be able to refer to the BIP in question so that we don't have to repeat this stuff in the discussions. Too bad they aren't covered by it in the current state.
@_date: 2017-04-11 19:05:21
So... the hardware wallet is ready because it doesn't care about UASF and your chrome application and nodes are not yet ready?
So you support UASF in general and work on getting your app/nodes ready?
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:13:47
It's called the nuclear option because you have to start from the ground up again and it makes no sense to actually do it, but it makes sense to use it as a threat. (see Cold War)
The only way to use it as a threat is either
- to present yourself as a non-rational/crazy actor
- to use it as a response to another threat of similar magnitude
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:59:46


At the current hashrate support, we would have around 2 months of delayed blocks.


This sounds like "We don't have the issue now, why should we have it in the future?". The biggest mining pool right now has around 16%. There are no incentives for them to attack the 84%. Attacking a 25%/30% minority chain after a split on the other hand is a whole different game. 


Pow change, like the other things (delayed blocktimes, hashrate attacks, ...) is something that is not inherent to the proposal but should be considered as potential outcome/counter measure.
These are risks with above zero probability and very high damage potential. They should be considered accordingly when proposing such a change.
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:20:07


Why should miners be afraid if there is a lot of software (nodes) out there running their own (USAF, Litecoin, Dogecoin, ...) chain? As long as there is still the regular network of nodes processing transactions that connect users with miners and exchanges, nothing changes.
**Majority of USAF nodes does not matter.**
**Absolute amount of USAF nodes does not matter.**
**What matters is if the regular, non-USAF network is economically functional/viable.**
You don't change that by adding USAF nodes, you change that by reducing regular (non-USAF) nodes. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:19:25
Want to reduce the risk of UASF chain split? Add hashrate majority to its requirements, just like "user activated" BIP-16 did.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:04:48


Unanimous agreements are practically impossible to reach once the project reaches a certain size. What kind of minimum percentage would you consider enough to adopt a change? SegWit currently has 95% requirement and ~30% support.
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:34:23
I think in 70% of the conversations here, it is not necessary to distinguish between hard- and soft-fork.
But anyway, after a change you get some blocks and nodes that act according to new rules, which can give you trouble in these scenarios:
- Old node handles new block
- New node handles old block 
The terms hard-/ and soft-fork consider what happens when an **old node sees a new block**. 
- A hard-fork change forces old nodes to reject new blocks
- A soft-fork change allows old nodes accept new blocks


This is true. Considering the rule "blocks need to be less than 1MB", when you switch to 2MB, old nodes will reject them (hard-fork). When you switch to 0.75MB, old nodes will still accept them (soft-fork).
**Fork != chain split**
So far I have seen different usages of the term "chain split". It's a little bit fuzzy but I would describe it as an **enduring** fork in the blockchain. Enduring in this case means constant over time with a supporting network behind it. Because it has to survive at least *some* time (which isn't very specific)  there is probably demand in trading both sides which makes it interesting for exchanges to list them.
Blockchains fork from time to time because of the block/hashrate race. These are resolved after a few blocks. **These are no chain splits**. Ethereum introduced a rollback which led to a consistent fork that is still traded on exchanges: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. **This was a chain split.**
In order to assess risks of chain splits, the distinction between hard- and soft-fork is of little use. Miners need to update in both soft-/ and hard-fork-scenarios. You need to consider the whole ecosystem to assess if there is enough demand for both chains to survive in order to create a chain split.
**Hard- and soft-forks might end in a chain split or not, that depends on the whole ecosystem and in large part on the miners. (e.g. BIP-50 describes a hard-fork without a chain split)**
In general, changes usually don't create chain splits as long as there is enough agreement (users, miners, exchanges). This is why it is important to make sure that at least a minimum agreement has been reached. Unfortunately we are only able to accurately measure that agreement within the miners group (using PoW), not within the community of users.

@_date: 2017-04-06 13:40:22


Where did you get that percentage from?
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:25:54
The terms hard-/ and soft-fork consider what happens when an **old node (= old rules) sees a new block (= new rules)**. 
- A hard-fork change forces old nodes to reject new blocks
- A soft-fork change allows old nodes accept new blocks
Considering the rule "blocks need to be less than 1MB", when you switch to 2MB, old nodes will reject them (hard-fork). When you switch to 0.5MB, old nodes will still accept them (soft-fork).
If the implementation of your new rule will make old nodes reject blocks under this new rule it would be considered a hard-fork. When old nodes accept them it would be considered a soft-fork.
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:39:24
Assuming 30% SegWit signalling and hashrate, in order to benefit from the SegWit increase you need to
- wait for SegWit to lock-in (~~2016~~ ~1411 blocks)
- wait for SegWit to activate (2016 blocks)
- have transactions use SegWit format
At 30% hashrate with 34 min blocktime this will take at least ~~90 days~~ 57 days.
Successful UASF needs hashrate majority (or maybe economic supermajority, but this would get dirty).
I didn't account for the 30% headstart in the locked-in period and the difficulty readjustment (thanks @_date: 2017-04-10 14:30:54

LN needs on-chain transactions for channel maintenance (planned and unplanned because of e.g. node dropout). This creates an upper limit on the usability of LN.
Higher fees due to full blocks might give an incentive for larger hubs to broadcast old states vs. their low capacity clients (e.g. when the client's channel balance is &lt; transaction fee), making LN less secure.
LN needs larger blocks for significant adoption. It also needs more sophisticated route discovery methods than broadcasting.

Unfortunately it increases non-linearly because the failure risk increases non-linearly for longer hops. 5 intermittent hops is often around 5-10s in my experience (when multiple routes have to be attempted), which is neither "instant" nor "stupidly fast". 
Unless the whole process is &lt;100ms I won't consider it "instant".

Assuming you mean that one channel can be involved in routing multiple transactions, it doesn't change the fact that channel maintenance is regularly needed to open, close and update LN channels. As these happen on-chain, a block size limit is a limiting factor in that scenario.

It is quite easy when you think UASF single-handedly ~~only~~ caused SegWit:
Either you think UASF had majority support, then I would be interested in seeing evidence for that claim.
Or you think UASF had only minority support, then you should accept that minority groups are able to change Bitcoin.
Edit: sorry, I missed that you actually chose B in your first response:

In 2018:
[Average transaction fee]( dropped ~92%
[SegWit adoption]( increased ~4%.
[Number of outputs]( dropped ~14%.
[Number of transactions]( dropped ~28%.
[Number of outputs - number of transactions]( dropped ~30-40%
[Number of BTC transferred, excluding change adresses]( dropped ~40%
[Amount of USD transferred]( dropped ~50%

The number of outputs per transaction is slightly increasing, suggesting more batching.

There is a drop in the beginning of 2018 in

What is your evidence that batching **increased** and **caused huge parts** of the drops?
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:19:40


Batching should only reduce the number of change outputs.

BIP91 reduced the SegWit activation threshold from 95% to 80% and activated SegWit by combining regular SegWit and SegWit2X votes.

- Jan 2018: 0.19% (17141 of 8.873.120)
Transactions with more than 100 outputs are **quite rare (1 in 500)** so I doubt that a change in their absolute numbers mean much, do you expect their share to rise significantly?
According to [outputs.today]( the ratio of **all outputs/transactions** has changed from 2.6 to 2.94 in the last 4 month.

It's probably difficult to establish if Bitcoin was used less in 2018 due to 
- lack of spam attack
- high fees
- media rush dying out
and I don't think that we can present a good a argument in favour of either of these.
Let's hope that the slow but steady increases in batching and Segwit gives us enough time for LN and other measures to increase tx/second.
Bitcoin shouldn't have to be afraid of the next media rush.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:39:14
I agree for the most parts.


This sounds a bit arrogant and makes compromises difficult. Obviously it wasn't the best option for them. Miners are expected to act in their rational own best financial-self interest and they want the same thing since 2015. **A 2MB hard-fork.** Blockstream presidents were in favour, Core devs were in favour.
SegWit in exchange for a 2MB hard-fork was and still is the compromise. "We could have had Segwit and 2MB a long time ago and by now Core might have gotten around to implementing FlexCaps as well."

I think that most node operators are Bitcoin users that are capable to form and express an opinion on the SegWit debate.
Even when you assume that nobody ran multiple nodes back then (which is probably not true - but anyway), the percentage of node operators in favour of UASF was never bigger than 13% (or 7% depending on which estimates you choose).
If a majority of users were supportive of UASF I would wonder why between 87% and 93% of those users that also happen to run nodes were ~~against it~~ not voting for it*.

**BIP148 activated, you are right, I'm sorry.** I confused the lock-in date of BIP91 with the ones for BIP141.


BIP148 activated on Aug 1st, but had no effect (i.e. did not behave differently than other clients) due to BIP91.
On Aug 8th, SegWit locked-in, turning BIP148 inactive.
The reason your BIP148 node syncs fine today is because BIP148 does not have different consensus rules than other clients after Nov 15th 2017.
I will edit my parent posts accordingly. Thanks for making me check the details.

They are interested in a compromise since 2015. They want the same thing since 2015. Segwit only with a 2MB hard-fork.
In 2016 there was a compromise called "Hong Kong Agreement".
Miners expected Core to release SegWit + 2MB hard-fork in a version of Core. That didn't happen. Now they try again with NYA.
Demanding that miners accept Core's proposal is not a compromise.

Why should they uninstall Core?
The NYA signees could just spin up a few thousand nodes and only have to make sure they are connected to the economically viable ones.
This was the strategy behind UASF: You don't care for the majority of nodes, you only care about the economically important ones. The companies behind NYA represent a significant part of the Bitcoin economy.
When UASF was able to force a protocol change with limited economic backing and no hashrate, why shouldn't Segwit2X succeed with more economic backing and a super-majority of hashrate?

I did not claim to see it. There is, quite obviously, no consensus about it.

UASF even argued to represent the economic majority and that it is fine to force other parties in the Bitcoin space.
Bitcoin is to big to be changed using consensus. You won't get 100% agreement. **Bitcoin is anonymous, decentralized and permissionless. You don't even know how many voters are out there and if they are real or fake.**

"[...] the ability for a protocol change to be successfully implemented ultimately rests with those who accept bitcoins in exchange for value. Generally those will be the merchants. [...]"
According to 






 had the list of companies that supported UASF with corresponding weights just like they do now with Segwit2X. It became quickly apparent that UASF was unable to secure an "economic majority" that it set out to represent.
As a result, support for UASF was not measured anymore in "industry support" but in node counts, twitter accounts and hat pictures.

During UASF that was a good thing.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:16:47


Sorry but this is not how I remember it.
UASF's major argument was in the beginning that it represented the economic majority and that it was justified to threaten a minority fork because the economic majority is more important than the miners. UASF did not gain a significant economic backing (in comparison to Segwit2x) and so it became all about Reddit accounts and hats.
Now Segwit2X actually has economic backing and suddenly the sub is flooded by how bad it is that corporations try to influence Bitcoin. By the same people that advocated for UASF before.
Corporations are the driving factor for Bitcoin adoption. They are an important part in the space.
There are dangerous narratives being pushed in this sub:
- UASF: Miners are evil, economic majority is key
- NYA: Corporations are evil, economic majority is irrelevant
- Segwit2X: Users that support Segwit2X are evil
This feels very much like divide and conquer.

That link is quite confusing, are you assuming a fixed number of outputs and that every new tx with &gt;= 100 outputs ("after batching") replaces 100 tx ("before batching") (e.g. 2 tx with 50 outputs each "before batching" would be counted as 100 reduced tx "after batching")?
What is your explanation that outputs* have dropped to Jul/Aug 2017 levels and are down ~50% since 2018 and ~30% since Jan 2017?
We have two expectations that I think we can agree on:
- Decrease in usage leads to **less outputs* and less txs**
- Increase in batching leads to **less txs** and doesn't affect outputs*
We currently observe **[less outputs*]( and [less tx](
Possible explanations:
- A) Decrease in usage alone explains the observation
- B) Decrease in usage explains less outputs, increase in batching emphasizes less tx
- C) Increase in batching explains less tx, "X" explains less outputs
Of these, A) explains the observed data and is the least complex. C) would introduce a new influencing component "X". If you favour C, what is your "X"?
\*) excl. change outputs
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:41:31
This example might help:
- **A (0.5) ↔ (0.5) B**
- You (A) send 0.4 to B
- A (0.1) ↔ (0.9) B
- Now let's say you also have a channel with Z, and B has a channel with Y:
- **Z (0.5) ↔ (0.5) A** (0.1) ↔ (0.9) **B (0.5) ↔ Y (0.5)**
- Y now sends 0.4 BTC to Z via B and A:
- Z (0.9) ↔ (0.1) **A (0.5) ↔ (0.5) B** (0.9) ↔ Y (0.1)
Notice how the total balances across all channels of A (0.5+0.1) and B (0.9+0.5) does not change because of the payment between Y and Z, yet your channel with B has been rebalanced.

Arguing that Segwit2X will fail because another agreement has failed is not a very substantiated argument, esp. considering that the continuous signalling has lead to Segwit activation.

Node count is used by some as a proxy for user adoption.
UASF had around 13% of nodes and some say it was a user "grassroot" movement that the majority of users supported.
If NYA takes some spare change and spins up a few hundred nodes they could claim the same amount of "user support" as UASF had.
One option to avoid that argument is to increase the number of non-Segwit2X nodes, thus reducing the percentage of Segwit2X nodes and thus reducing Segwit2X's "user adoption".
Once a certain saturation of connectivity between economic actors has been reached, nodes matter little in terms of fork proposals. Above that saturation it becomes a marketing instrument like you assumed.

You are probably referring to [F2Pool](


You could probably argue if it was justified for F2Pool do leave the HKA, but it is their decision, not "**the miners**'".
**Saying F2Pool represents all the miners is like saying luke-jr represents all of Core. Actions of one individual/miner do not affect the commitment of others.**
The reason HKA did not succeed was not because of F2Pool but because Core did not release a hard-fork in a version of Bitcoin Core, which miners expected they would.
nullc made it clear after the HKA, that the attendees were in no position to make promises and it was made clear that there is no consensus for hard-forks at the time and as such "Core" would not add one.

BIP91 and the resulting lock-in of SegWit (BIP141) prevented BIP148 [to have an effect].
~~BIP148 did never activate,~~ no blocks were discarded because of it, no chain split was created.

BIP148 does not affect todays consensus rules ~~, even if it had been activated~~ (Activated BIP148 would only affect consensus between Aug 1st to Nov 15th 2017).
~~You are confusing these statements~~

Thanks, you were really spot on with your 95% estimate :-)
P(R|E) would be interesting to model, e.g.:
- node connectivity/availability (this model assumes 100%)
- balances across channel in favour of the desired payment direction (this model assumes 50:50)
Maybe a real-life simulation would be useful to bootstrap the model, i.e. setup two nodes, connect them to random/"opposite" ends in the LN and route payments between them from time to time.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:59:07
Just for clarification: Did you really think that a 6% failure rate meant that in 6% of payments attempts, your money would be lost?
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:53:58


They increased from 0.085% to 0.19%, they are quite rare (1 in 500).
The number of **all outputs per transaction** does increase (at least longterm, see also outputs.today) but they do not fully explain the 2018 decrease in total outputs. I suppose it is a combination of less usage (maybe even spam?), less hype and batching.




As long as the assumption holds, that - on average - every transaction has one change output, it doesn't matter which address is the change address. It estimates the number of change outputs to be one per transaction, i.e. the number of change outputs equals the number of transactions per time frame.

You can't understand the current situation without considering years of Bitcoin history between miners and Core dev [1],[2]. 
You can't understand NYA without knowing about the Hong Kong Agreement of 2016 [3].
Ignoring history it now boils down to:
- Option A is supported by all Core dev
- Option B is supported by all miners
Assume all other groups are split 50%/50% or aren't measurable in a reliable way.
**Who should decide/be in control of Bitcoin?**
Some assume that **Core devs** were and should be in control. A successful Segwit2X means that Core devs "veto" was ignored - which implies a loss of control which is framed as an attack.
If the fork happens, the market will decide which means that the coin with the higher market value is probably going to be considered the "true" Bitcoin. You can't control the buyers/sellers directly, but you can try and create a sentiment against the other coin. Framing it as "an attack by evil actors" is one method of doing so.
**The exploding numbers of anti-Segwit2X in this sub don't discuss technical details anymore and instead aim to manipulate perceived market-value.**
An actual compromise that aligns Core's roadmap from 2015 (which hasn't changed since) with miners requests from 2015 (which haven't changed since) is not being demanded because you don't negotiate with ~~terrorists~~ miners.

How do you test who is in control of Bitcoin?
UASF was a minority movement and some say they caused Segwit.
Were those in control? Bitcoin is is a permissionless network. It will change as often as people are not satisfied with it. Miners don't seem to feel heard by Core since 2 years ago. They agreed to activate Segwit if there is a hardfork to 2MB which is the same position they had during the HKA. 
I am glad that we are past the point that Segwit2X is bad because of technical parameters and get to the "Core" of the issue - and it's a social and not a technical one. And it's not about "evil" Bitcoiners that want to destroy Bitcoin. That is just a distraction.
**The issue at its center is the breakup between Core and miners.**
It seems like there is an active movement to establish that all miners are evil - therefore there is no need for negotiations. Even worse, some say that miners are not allowed to have an opinion and that they should shut up and just do what they are being told.
This massively distorts my personal sense on who should have which weight in these discussions. It also has the risks of ignoring important players in the game: Miners have a lot to lose and have a considerate amount of power. If they didn't have any power, we wouldn't need to worry about Segwit2X. Ignoring them and and instead saying some Reddit (sockpuppet?-)accounts (with probably considerably less to lose) should have more say in the matter because "we are the users, UASF, UASF, UASF!!11!" does not feel right.
Even more, it gives people a reason not to talk to "the other side".
**Remember, they are evil after all - and not like us.**

Thought about it:
A) Max-flow won't change the probabilities that a multi-path payment is possible for a certain amount (i.e. first graph should be similar). A non-optimal flow would result in more splits than necessary, but it wouldn't fail the payment completely. I think the process I described is basically the Ford–Fulkerson max-flow algo.
B) A better max-flow could reduce the median number of splits/paths needed (i.e. second graph could be improved). I'll check if I can get this implemented. I wouldn't expect notable differences below 0.1 BTC but wouldn't be surprised if the median number of paths &gt;= 0.1 BTC could be improved considerably by this.

This obviously leaves a gap were both can follow the agreement and there is still no Segwit.
You could argue that the HKA has been, in fact fulfilled:
- **Core has no obligation to implement a hard-fork in a released version of Bitcoin Core**.
- **Miners have no obligation to run Segwit unless a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core**.






How do we get from "Core is waiting on community support" to "Miners are actively blocking"?


Miners want a hard-fork since 2015. "We activate Segwit if somebody gives us a 2MB hardfork." HKA did not deliver. NYA is the next try.

This is like determining if Greenland is bigger than Africa by throwing different map projections at each other.
How about finding out what you actually want to express using those renderings (really nice ones btw, I like the one that looks like an explosion the most) and then find an objective metric, e.g. land area in square meters.
Most of the times those projections of the LN are used to highlight centralization aspects as a support for the argument that LN is easy to censor or less robust.
Instead of countering with another rendering/projection we should counter with a well defined metric, e.g. the amount of payment failures after x nodes have been removed.
I feel that switching to these metrics instead of countering with renderings alone would make discussions much more focussed and less tiring.

Note that the currently deployed autopilot heuristic aims for a scale-free network, i.e. the distribution of channels per node would follow a power-law distribution.
This means a few nodes have many channels and many nodes have few channels, i.e. "hub and spokes".
The current model (scale-free network) is quite robust against random dropouts, but not so much against attacking hubs specifically (see my other graphs for attack effects on the largests hubs).
Developing suitable heuristics for the autopilot to achieve
- low number of hops
- high reliability
- robustness against attacks/dropouts
- low fees

@_date: 2018-07-02 19:43:48
There are now three different graphs in circulation that have led to quite some confusion in the community. I hope I can clear this up a bit:
**The** [**original post**]( was about how the network developed in terms of increases in capacity and number of connections. It is very difficult to put topology into metrics which is why I chose to "blindly" select random nodes and see what kind of payments are possible between them. The model will try different routes between two nodes and give you the percentage about how many routes between them were able to route a certain payment. If nodes were adding bigger channels or increased the number of channels, you would see an improvement in this metric.
It does **not** answer the question (1):


**The** [**second post**]( is the result of some people asking me to rerun it using only start- and end-nodes that have sufficient funding. The assumption being that start- and end-nodes with more funding are probably also "more deeply" connected with the rest of the network. The model will report on the average share of routes between two nodes that have at least twice the amount that is being routed.
Assume for a second two nodes that are connected via 10 different routes with 1 hops each (A-&gt;H1-&gt;B, A-&gt;H2-&gt;B, ... A-&gt;H10-&gt;B); only 1 out of the 10 has sufficient funding to route the payment. The metric will report that 10% of those routes are able to route that payment. But as long as that 1 route is available and has enough funding, 100% of payment attempts would go through.
It gives you information about the answer to:


I attempted multiple times ([1]( [3]( [4]( ...) to clear up this confusion, as the second post still doesn't answer the question (1) and served the same purpose as the first post: Trying to get a better idea of how nodes are connected by trying to **randomly** route funds between them.
As the post spread around via [this]( and [that]( (unfortunately without my prior consultation) I noticed that people assumed that the graphs were answering the question (1).
This led me to create [**this post here**]( Although it still doesn't answer question (1), I think it provides a more closer approach to what people expected from the graphs in the first place.
It will select two nodes that have at least twice the payment amount in channels. It will then check if there is **at least one** route between them with sufficient funding along the path and report how often it could find such a route amongst all pairs of sufficiently funded nodes.
It gives you information about the answer to:


For those interested in the details:
- assumes balanced channels (i.e. equally split between both partners)
- assumes optimal route discovery (i.e. if there is at least one route, the algo will discover it)
- ignores LNs temporary payment limit at 0.042 BTC (but you can see where it would cut off in the graph)
Ah, by the way, you can also see how routing probability improves with the number of hops. 3 hops looks quite good so far :-)
I hope I didn't cause too much confusion because of this. In hindsight I can see how the misunderstanding came into place, esp. when considering the shortened graph titles. It is a complex issue that is difficult to put into a concise and understandable title.
I also noticed that this was reposted in "another sub" as a proof that LN can't scale/route larger payments.
Let me be clear about this:
- LN is released on main for about 6 month now
- LN protocol currently does not allow to route larger payments or fund large channels (max. payment ~0.042 BTC, max. funding ~0.167 BTC) for safety concerns
- This does not mean that it can't scale, only that LN devs are playing it safe
- AMP will improve these probabilities **massively**
I hope my post can spark a discussion about what kind of metrics are useful to evaluate LN properties.
Sorry for the long read.

Yes, it needs to be funded at least with the amount you'd want to transfer and it currently needs to have enough balance on the sender side of each channel involved.
Note that if you have more than one connection your channel might get rebalanced by routing payments for third parties, making it less necessary to close/reopen your channels.
Assuming the amount of BTC you want to lock-up in BTC is fixed, the more channels you maintain, the less BTC you are going to have locked up per channel and the smaller is the max. amount you can pay/route via LN. Currently you can't pay a larger invoice by combining multiple routes with smaller capacities, but [it is being worked on](

Interesting, I wouldn't consider LN nodes to be money transmitters as they don't have irrevocable control over the funds.
I would assume that the purpose of the regulation would be risk reduction for customers. If the risk is negligible in the first place, what would a regulation achieve?
This is probably from a naive point of view, but if regulators were out to regulate crypto, they wouldn't need LN as an excuse to do it.

Actually one of my first stat posts were about that (see [here]( and [here]( You could use the number of nodes you need to remove in order to make a certain amount of payment fails and record the area under that curve as a (de-)centralization score.

@_date: 2018-07-06 21:58:15
This graphs show the differences in finding at least one suitable payment route in the single-path and in the multi-path payment scenario.
The process is like this:
- Iterate over all nodes and calculate the sum of each node's channel balances (balance are assumed to be evenly split)
- Remove every node that has a balance sum less than the payment in question
- Between the remaining nodes, select two at random
- Find the route between them that supports the largest possible payment in the direction in question
- Route the largest possible sub-payment (max. the actual payment) across that route (i.e. reduce channel balances along that route accordingly, ignore fees)
- Repeat until payment is complete (success) or channels are exhausted (fail)
- Report the number of pairs where the payment was successful vs. the number of pairs attempted
- Report the median number of paths that where needed to complete the payment
Note that this is a theoretical result that is operating on perfect knowledge. You can take these probabilities as the upper limit of what a perfect multi-path solution could not exceed in the current topology. Actual implementations of AMP will be below these probabilities.
\*) Based on the feedback given by I would assume that the number of median splits/paths listed in this graph are **not necessarily upper limits** and might be improved upon in the actual AMP implementation.
I think this is still useful to get a rough idea about the theoretically possible improvements.

Sure, but they have no control over the funds they forwarded. If your point is that the particular funds in question don't practically leave the transmitter, I'd argue that then there isn't any money transmission at all; only two parties exchanging funds with each other.


Thanks for the quote. Didn't know that FinCEN was so specific with regards to mining. What about the fact that miners include transactions in the block, thus actually manifesting the money transfer?
Both (LN node and miner) are involved in the process to make money flow from point A to point B and none can take funds away from the parties involved.

Excellent question, that is not immediately obvious. Let me try:
As the amount of BTC increases, more nodes are being ignored (we only route between nodes with sufficient funding). If the remaining nodes are better connected, the probability increases.
Imagine 2 nodes that share a bigger channel than everybody else. As the payment amount increases, at some point, only those 2 would be left over. As they are directly connected, probability to route between them increases to 100%.

Onion routing is the process of delivering encrypting messages across an **already known route**.
One issue in LN is how the **route discovery** can scale to global levels. Unless channels become quite big (and thus probably affect centralization) the network topology will change after each payment somewhere in the network.
Number of channels * channel update per time = a whole lot of updates to be considered in route discovery.

No. It only allows you to send payments, but not receive them.

BIP148 and UASF FAQ:

**UASF - The [Leeroy Jenkins]( of SegWit.**
This is paradox. It sounds like BIP148 has a higher risk of success the more its proponents are expected to not back down **no matter what**, e.g. by appearing crazy or irrational (crazy general, burnt bridges, ...).
But arguing that "crazy" UASF supporters should behave that way because game theory suggests it makes them reasonable again. Even could not pull that off anymore.
UASF won't be activated by the "users". It will only get activated if big economic players **support it by DROPPING support for the regular chain**. Unfortunately it does not appear to be in the interest of these big players right now to do this. It remains to be seen if *supporting UASF* while also supporting the regular chain will exert enough pressure - I seriously doubt it.
I am very much in favour of backroom conversations as long as the proposal is specific in terms of responsibilities (e.g. can you "support" UASF and regular chain at the same time?), goals, actions and time-lines and cryptographically signed by its proponents. There were too many agreements made in good faith but badly executed (HK v1.0, UASF - mailing list style, UASF - BIP148 style, UASF - BIP149 style, Silbert/HK v2.0?, ...). 
This is a multi-billion dollar industry.

BIP148 supporters: 
Are Coinbase and Blockchain part of the economic majority?
Is the economic majority the deciding factor to activate BIP148?
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:33:24
Yeah I get that. I also had around 6K nodes in mind. IIRC I first saw luke-jr's 100K number during a discussion about the Classic client, it had like 1K nodes and it was used to argue how small of a market share that was and how like 98% run Core. 
Isn't the source available from his site? If not, I'm pretty sure he'll release the source if you ask nicely. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:38:55
The [site]( you link to states:


Right now there is no economic majority behind UASF.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:50:43
Well, they had &gt;80% and then suddenly around 0% when nonSegwit2X miners started ASIC mining on the Segwit2X testnet. Not saying they shouldn't have prepared for that. But you don't lose 80% hashrate between two blocks on the mainnet. So "horribly wrong" is a bit overly dramatic. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:59:19
Yes, you are right.
But it would be wrong to say that UASF has less risk than Segwit2X. Both are being rushed, but Segwit2X at least guarantees a minimum amount of hashrate support before it activates. This reduces the risk of a chain split.
BIP148 doesn't care about support at all and thus bears increased risks of a chain split.
Please remember that there a two different camps of UASF supporters. Those that care for economic majority ( and those that don't.
**Also please note that 50% of Core developers are against BIP148.**

Where do you read that? Both Segwit2X and luke-jr are talking about a 8MB block size **limit** which is exactly what you would expect as it is 2x the limit of regular Segwit (4MB). Nobody expects Segwit2X to have 2MB block size limit when Segwit already has 4MB.
Let's say the mempool only consists of legacy, non-segwit transactions. The largest block you could create out of that with Segwit is 1MB, with Segwit2X it's 2MB, exactly what you would expect. I honestly don't see any deceit in this.


This is new to me, I have to read luke's post in more detail, will edit later.

Those $50 would be better spent on buying a few thousand sybil nodes.
Nodes are **useless** for voting. We can't even agree on how many there are that should count (luke-jr says 100.000, bitnodes21 say 8.000).
I think luke-jr had some suggestions on how to make a better "user" vote - maybe burning a few satoshi during a transaction on voting addresses?

From the **[Specification](
1. If segwit2x (BIP91 signal) activates at block N, then block N+12960 activates a new plain block size limit of 2 MB (2,000,000 bytes). In this case, at block N+12960 a hard-fork occurs.
2. The block that activates the hard-fork must have a plain block size greater than 1 MB.
- there are old clients that do not know of step 2 and
- there have been no blocks mined according to step 2?
First one leads to  chugging along and  being stuck at 27070.
Why did BIP91 trigger in the first place? I see no signalling at  (Edit: Signaling at bit 4 and bit 1 was active up until block [20306](
From the **[test plan](
The goal is to progress through the Segwit2X deployment lifecycle and:
- Simulate possible signaling/activation scenarios
- Observe behavior of heterogenous client nodes on the network throughout the deployment
- Allow all WG members to identify any integration issues with their stack
- Load test with scripted transactions
	- Simple boundary cases - 1MB / 1.1MB / 2MB / no segwit / all segwit, etc
	- Random transaction load approximating livenet

How much?
There is no agreement on how to exactly measure economic support but it is clear that different exchanges have different economic impact.
An exchange like Poloniex with ~10% of the global trading volume has more economic impact than an exchange like Bitonic with ~0.02% of the global trading volume.
 tries to assign different weights based on their estimated economic impact. This results in around 5% of weighted support by the economic community.

You don't vote with UASF nodes. The economic majority does by announcing support.
The idea was to only signal support first.
As soon as the economic majority signals support, start running software that enforces the split.

Want to show that Core has super-majority? Use luke-jr's bigger count (~100.000).

The distinction between soft and hard-forks is only useful when you are concerned with how old nodes will handle new rules. It has nothing to do with "code as law".

1. Segwit2X has **2X** the block size and limits of Segwit
2. 8MB is the limit, not the average block size
3. The average block size of Segwit is around 2MB
4. The average block size of Segwit2X is around 4MB
So Segwit2X causes an average increase of **100GB per year** vs Segwit, assuming
- blocks are full
- everybody switches to Segwit transactions
- miners don't enforce a soft-limit
At current hard drive storage prices of around $0.028/GB, **100GB cost $2.80**.

The reason we have consensus is primarily Segwit2X. BIP148/UASF provided the deadline by threatening a split on Aug 1st. We wouldn't have Segwit about to lock-in right now if it weren't for both of them.
Segwit2X has major support by economic actors. Bitcoin Cash does not. The more interesting hard-fork is going to happen in November (4MB vs 2MB block size).

You only download a block once - just like you would a webpage. You **should** upload it to multiple peers. Default settings will connect your client to 8 peers. Uploading 4 MB every 10 minutes to 7 peers takes about 0.4 Mbps.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:09:29
The agreement mentions a 2MB hard fork in addition to Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:56:36


This is true but it does not guarantee you safety.
Let's say you support BIP148, run its client and receive money on it after Aug 1st. Then BIP148 fails to get enough hashrate to reorg the main chain and dies later. Your money is gone.
This is especially relevant the less hashrate is behind BIP148. Once BIP148 has majority your statement has more weight as the main chain has a higher risk of being reorged than BIP148 has of dying.
This has been discussed [here](
Note: This is nothing new and is why  warns about activating it with minority support.

Yes, if you don't consider hashrate distribution which determines the reorg probability.
As long as the main chain has the majority hashrate it has less risk of a wipeout than BIP148 has of dying. Once BIP148 is expected to reach majority hashrate I would similarly warn about transacting on the main chain.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:50:30
Yeah, at least that's a measure that is hard to sybil. Although I worry that it is a bad measure of desired results, i.e vote. It is basically a measure of what the people assume what the majority wants. 
I might want chain A to succeed but based on some propaganda I believe many others want B. Then it would be rational to not vote in my own interest and buy chain B instead. It is difficult to honestly cast my vote if I must fear to lose money should I "choose wrong".

@_date: 2017-07-03 23:42:57


It's difficult to assess how many people actually support UASF. Neither hashrate, nodes, exchanges or businesses have signaled support in any significant way.
Still, 52% of Core developers seem to be in support of it and it seems to have an alluring effect at least to some, mainly because **risk assessment is difficult and people are tired.**
We have been in a stalemate for a couple of years now and users can finally get the feeling of actively doing something and being in control by supporting the **User**ASF.
This is why there is a significant amount of rhetoric being spent on convincing users that
- there are evil actors at work
- miners want to harm Bitcoin and take control away from you, but
- the solution is simple and
- they don't need to worry about the specifics 
Usually this is expressed like this:
- "All miners are evil and want to grab control of bitcoin."
- "Full nodes == economic majority"
- "Hashrate is irrelevant"
- "Hard-forks always split the chain, soft-forks never split the chain."
- "If a soft-forks doesn't get enough hashrate and splits the chain, it is not the soft-fork that splits the chain but the miners that failed to join."
- "Switching to BIP148 client is the safer bet, no matter the hashrate."
- "You are either with us or against us."
- " 
To my experience, people using these phrases often don't care for complicated, tiring technical arguments.
**People want to feel in control again.**
**People are afraid miners are taking something away from them.**
Even worse Segwit2X takes the victory **they** were fighting for (activating Segwit) away from them.
**They** spent the times and efforts campaigning for it, and then **those pesky miners and evil companies** come around, make a backroom deal **without us** and just "agree" to activate Segwit? At least they should get some credit for setting the ultimatum.
It is not about assessing the risks of a chain split vs those of hard-fork. Users want to be heard. Users believe that the "U" in UASF gives them a voice and control.

**100% of blocks are currently signalling SegWit support.**
 BIP148 will still activate on Aug 1st (because SegWit has not yet officially been locked in) but most certainly won't split the network (unless miners switch back and start producing non-SegWit-signalling blocks again which is very unlikely).

Ah, those were the times when it was **Bitcoin vs The rest of the world**.
Now it is **~~Core vs Unlimited~~, ~~1MB vs 2MB~~, ~~Pro-Segwit vs Anti-Segwit~~, 2MB vs 4MB**.

He said, 'SegWit by MASF'' I said, 'Me, too! SegWit by MASF with **1MB blocksize** or SegWit by MASF with a **2MB blocksize**?'
He said, 'SegWit by MASF with a 2MB blocksize!' I said, 'Me, too! SegWit by MASF with a 2MB blocksize **Hong Kong Roundtable Agreement of 2016**, or SegWit by MASF with a 2MB blocksize **New York Agreement of 2017**?'
He said, 'SegWit by MASF with a 2MB blocksize New York Agreement of 2017!'

What down/up speeds would you expect using Tor?
**Edit 
I found a source that claims 50% of measured speeds are faster than 1.6 Mbps - does that match your personal experience?

This is indeed an interesting use case. How does a node setup behind Tor differ from regular setups (e.g. default number of connected peers, ...) ?

It is really difficult to do that. You don't even know how many nodes are out there. Luke-jr says 100.000, bitnodes21 say 8.000.
Also it is really, really easy to sybil nodes. You can just make a few thousand appear out of thin air with a few keystrokes or pay somebody a few bucks.

Yeah, though not necessarily. It depends on your personal preference. You might be willing to take a cut in market price in order to get (more security, more decentralization, more market adoption) in the long run.

Forks need majority support or otherwise they cause chain splits.
**UASF was once about economic majority (see original post in the mailing list and the UASF FAQ at 
Somewhere along the process some proponents stopped caring about the economic majority and **node count** became the main metric to "prove" community support for BIP148.
If you are worried that **"some" miners and companies** can affect consensus rules, then you should also be worried that **"some" UASF users** can affect consensus rules.
The difference here being, we have a sybil-resistant metric to at least show miner support, while we don't have any sybil-resistant metric to show user support.
Be suspicious about claims of support - no matter from which side.

Yes, by splitting the chain (unless majority joins in). You can't prevent a few people from coming together and running their own hard-fork. Bitcoin is permissionless.
**BIP148 cannot reorg the main chain without majority support.**
@_date: 2017-07-09 12:17:48
Correct, this is something that should be addressed, independent of the scaling proposal.
Global increase of connection speed help though. If you'd live in the USA, IBD (of current blockchain) would have taken **3 days in 2009** but only **14 hours in 2017**.
IBD takes **2.2 days with Segwit** and **3.2 days with Segwit2X** (assuming 10Mbps and 1 year of Segwit/Segwit2X growth).
Maybe a few "checkpointed" torrents could help? Is there something in Core's roadmap about that?

@_date: 2017-07-01 22:09:03
Totally agree. Exchanges want to earn trading fees, so if we are going to get any additional significant chain, users will want to trade their coins and exchanges will provide access to that chain.
But this is different to an exchange actively encouraging BIP148 **before** activation.  argues correctly, that the economic majority should signal BIP148 support **before** people start running the UASF-client that could cause a chain split.
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:07:54
BIP148 still times out. Difficulty readjustment takes 2016 blocks as well. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:02:17
BIP148 will most likely cause a chain split. During a chain split it is unclear which chain will survive. If one dies, you lose the transactions in those blocks. This is why you shouldn't transact after the split until the dust has settled.

Yeah I am also not sure of what he meant by that.
Segwit2X has 8MB (vs 4MB) max block size limit, 2MB base block size (vs 1MB) and gives you in practice around 4MB (vs. 2MB) blocks, exactly what you would expect. But I'll read Luke-jr's post in more detail and try to make sense out of it.

@_date: 2017-07-01 10:51:25


Without hashrate majority and a reorg of the regular chain BIP148 causes a chain split. Different chains cause uncertainties, risk of transacting and losing money and rewards "on the wrong chain", replay attacks, drop in market prices, ...
This is why  recommends to not run the clients unless there is majority behind it.

According to Luke-jr 96% run standard BIP141 clients. If you assume that users express their votes on the scaling debate by running a corresponding client, then 96% of nodes vote for BIP141 (miners should decide or else status quo).

Those that will lose money because they received transactions on the BIP148 chain that died because it couldn't reorg the regular chain probably beg to differ.

There are miners to do step 2. But somehow they didn't include enough "stuff" in the block to bump its size over 1MB. Not sure if that was intentional or not.

I don't see any evidence of that. What are your sources?
I know of no metric where BIP148 has significantly more support than Segwit2X, with the exception of node count.
If BIP148 has overwhelming consensus then so has Segwit2X.
Node count should not be the determining factor since it is easily faked. Also you would have to agree that Segwit2X has overwhelming consensus once they happen to get more nodes than BIP148.

No, it is not. Economic majority != node majority.

Segwit has 1MB "base blocks", 2MB avg. block size and 4M limit.
Segwit2X has 2MB "base blocks", 4MB avg. block size and 8M limit.


Segwit2X is a 2x increase, not 8x.
See [this]( for an estimation of effects on bandwidth and storage.
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:12:41
No, it seems like you assume higher rewards because your miner has no competition (i.e. 100% "market share"), but this is not true (at least not in the beginning):
- Your rewards depends on the number of blocks you mine.
- The number of blocks you mine depends on your hashrate and the current difficulty.
- The difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks.
- Finding 2016 blocks takes around 5 months at 10% hashrate.
So until difficulty readjustment happens you will find the same number of blocks on every chain that has the same difficulty. It does not improve your odds.

@_date: 2017-07-03 17:04:41
So you suggest that the economic majority should be ignored because there is no policy in UASF BIP148 on how to measure it?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:31:30
BIP148/UASF is about treating blocks as invalid that don't signal SegWit. As of right now, 100% of blocks are signalling support for SegWit. UASF will still activate because SegWit has not officially locked in, but it won't have any effect because there are no blocks being mined that UASF considers invalid.
Next thing to look out for is &gt;13:20 UTC which is when Bitcoin Cash is expected to fork and mine the first block &gt; 1MB. Next thing after that is SegWit2X which will hard-fork some time in November. Look [here]( to keep track of the different forks.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:05:29
Thanks for the detailed response.
I couldn't find the original post which described it better than I can right now, but I remember the argument went like this:
Segwit is a blocksize increase, but it was incepted as a malleability fix. Miners benefit from more transactions but even more so currently from a higher Bitcoin price. Miners expect that increased adoption will raise the price. A malleability fix helps to provide a better basis for further 2nd layer applications which will increase adoption. Unfortunately 2nd layer payment channels would be possible as well that might steal "their" fees. So miners want a malleability fix but no off-line scaling.
On-chain scaling on the other hand requires a hard-fork and everybody is afraid of hard-forks. But once a hard-fork is successful the community will be less afraid and more open to on-chain scaling which will give miners more transactions and thus more fees.
**TLDR:** Miners want more transactions without off-chain-scaling. If they have to give up off-chain-scaling, they want at least "some" more transactions. If miners acting in their own best financial self-interest is "hurting" the protocol, then the protocol is flawed, not the miners.

I honestly would like to know how you got that impression? You are talking about a variety of organisations, individuals and mining pools.
Miners are expected to act in their best financial self interest. Which observations did you make that contradicted that?


Support for A given B != Support for A


How else would you distinguish between Segwit and Segwit2X support? We can't assume that everyone signaling Segwit is fine with a hard-fork. Also, Segwit2X switches to bit 1 after activation so legacy clients activate Segwit as well.
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:32:55

@_date: 2017-06-28 00:48:59

@_date: 2017-07-03 10:03:22


I agree, which is why I listed **bitnodes21**, they are the only ones that have a UASF and a total counter and they reach **7%**.
But let's assume for a moment that bitnodes21 is wrong, and there are 1.000 UASF nodes:
If luke-jr total counter is true, then UASF has 1% and Classic had ATH 6% (2.300/40.000*).
If luke-jr total counter is not true, then UASF has 13% and Classic had ATH 34% (2.300/6.800*)
*) luke-jrs total count at the Classic peak time IIRC
So if you use 13% UASF node support, you open yourself up to discussions that Classics had 34% support (in terms of how important node support is).

Where are they getting the control from? Who loses it instead? And why is it neutral right now?
95% of nodes want status quo.
85% of hashrate want Segwit2X.
50% of Core developers want BIP148.
Why is it neutral to let 50% of Core developers decide but a "power grab" to let 80% of hashrate decide?

Thanks for the additional info. Would you also estimate their daily trading volume at around $0.5M? Kraken (which is pretty big in Europe I think) handles $150M.
So although they are the biggest exchange sitting in the Netherland I doubt that qualifies as being a major exchange. Trading volume is crucial for estimating the economic impact. They "only" trade 0.3% of Kraken's, 0.2% of Poloniex's trading and 0.02% of "global/total" trading volume.

I am not sure OP was asking for BIP148 instead of Segwit, but I like the idea of a comparison table, so [here]( is my take.
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:38:44


This sounds odd. Let's assume BIP148 fails to reorg the main chain because it only has 20% hashrate and Segwit2X fails to activate as well. Now you have a chain split. Why do you consider this a success?
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:51:46
Soft-forks still cause chain splits without hashrate majority. Doesn't matter what some other people agree on. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:01:02
I would think so as well. Would you say that other actors in this community also have "unspoken self-interests"?
@_date: 2017-07-09 13:28:04


Yes, actual "syncing" time is affected primarily by CPU and not by the blockchain size, which is why it shouldn't be given too much weight in the decision for/against a scaling proposal.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:55:10
Still better than sybil-nodes with "UASF" uacomments.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:00:13
Happy to oblige. Proof of what exactly and what would you accept as proof?
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:05:40
HK agreement was poorly worded and bound to fail:


One of the miners (AFAIK it was F2Pool) signalled support for Classic. Some say that this is enough to break the agreement with all other miners and that all miners are at fault.


"Such a hard-fork" was never released in a version of Core. Some say that this is enough to break the agreement and Core is at fault.
**TLDR**: Good intent (miners + Blockstream + Core wanted Segwit + 2MB HF), bad execution. Segwit2X is next attempt - it has Segwit, 85% hashrate and a hard-fork that is released in a (forked) version of Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:17:08
I see your point. I also find Segwit2X quite risky.
Core can't support Segwit2X because it would be against their established policy to play it safe, esp. with regards to hard forks. 
AFAIK Core is not "totally" against Segwit + 2MB. They are against the way Segwit2X has come into existence and how it is being rushed/activated.
So let's assume Segwit2X (incl. HF) activates just fine, without a chain split, nodes update their software, etc... What would be so bad about it? Decentralization won't be affected much IMHO. Core repo could update their code to match the 2MB base block size + limits and rock on.
They wouldn't lose face because they were primarily opposed towards the activation method, not necessarily the goal.
I would also like to have either the HK agreement or Segwit1MB activate in 2016. But it didn't achieve majority support.
So insisting on Segwit1MB is like insisting on keeping the status quo. So if you would have to choose between "status quo", a successfull Segwit2X or a chain split, would you really want to stick with the status quo or choose the split?
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:56:03
You can find a comparison [here](
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:58:43
I was afraid you aren't able to. Let's move on.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:57:26
**Segwit2X does not change the behaviour of Segwit with regards to ASICBoost.** This means covert usage of ASICBoost is blocked in Segwit and thus also in Segwit2X.


@_date: 2017-06-05 19:28:17
There is no objective measure for BIP148 support.
There are a few companies that announced support at  but it was often unclear what they meant by "support" (i.e. running additional BIP148 nodes while still supporting the Core chain) and how to assess their economic impact. The same site lists a node count, but it is unclear how many nodes are sybils (there were a few thousand fake nodes in between on AWS); a few run actual binaries, but most just "signal support" by changing the user agent string on regular Core clients without actually enforcing BIP148.
It does not matter how many people support BIP148.
It does not matter how many nodes run BIP148.
**What matters is if miners think that not giving in to BIP148 will cost them money.**
**The actors that really decide the outcome are exchanges and miners.**
Exchanges will not discard the regular chain and it remains to be seen if they will list the BIP148 chain. 
If they do, you as a BIP148 supporter should sell your Core coins for BIP148 coins and hope that many do the same. If a majority of coin holders does that it will decrease the value of Core coin and increase the value of BIP148 coin. Of course you should make sure that either a replay protection is in place or you have split your coins beforehand.
*I would not advise to do this based on the numerous risks a chain split invokes. The regular chain will probably protect itself against a reorg through a hardfork or a invalidateblock-command. If BIP148 manages to gather a serious amount of hashrate (like &gt;30% vs the current 0.1%) a permanent split might be the result. Sell your coins before for an altcoin or just wait it out.*
 
It might also make sense to increase the perceived support for BIP148 by "spamming" this sub with extremely pro-BIP148 posts. (There is a handful of regular pro-BIP148 posters that solely engage in this currently). Not sure how the moderators are going about it but as long as you don't post links to binaries they seem to allow it.
So far it looks like BIP148 is the [Leeroy Jenkins]( of SegWit.
There is no way to accurately measure support for BIP148. Nodes count don't matter. What matters is if miners are afraid of it. Right now it doesn't look like it. But it might be enough to push them to SegWit2X. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:41:36
Based on my experience in this space, many people don't know the difference between **"having a different opinion"** and **"lying"**.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:16:15
You are totally right that we have no agreement on how to measure support.
coin.dance has a weighting of Bitcoin businesses according to (self-reported?) traffic which would amount to 5% (weighted) support for BIP148. In terms of node count luke-jr reports around 100.000 total nodes and the uasf page cites 1.000 UASF clients (500 of them actually enforcing BIP148).
We have no agreement on how to measure support which makes the discussion so difficult. People have a "sentiment" about user/community support based on social media, memes on Reddit, polls on Twitter but we shouldn't base our votes on who screams the longest the loudest.
@_date: 2017-07-02 11:53:15
You are affected if you choose BIP148 and it fails to become the longest chain and dies. (transactions and rewards lost) 
You are affected if you choose regular chain and BIP148 becomes the longest chain. (transactions and rewards lost)
You are affected if you're just a hodler and don't choose at all and BIP148 causes a chain split. (market price drops)

But just to add to your point: In a HF the amount of available space is not dependent on "Z%" (it is binary, 0% or 100% space increase), in SWSF it is (very roughly depending on "Z%").

Segwit has very high support in node distribution (i.e. clients running Core &gt;= 0.13.1).

UASF is a method to reduce the SegWit activation requirements.
- with majority hashrate it will force SegWit activation.
- without majority hashrate support **it will create a serious chain split**.
- right now it has **&lt;1% hashrate support**.
Segwit2x is also a method to reduce the SegWit activation requirements and it "doubles the blocksize".
- with majority hashrate it will force SegWit activation.
- without majority hashrate support (80%) **it will do nothing**.
- introduces a 2MB HF 3 month after SegWit activation
- Right now it has **85% hashrate support**.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:02:22


Sure, you could only signal **and** activate on bit 4. IIRC this is what Segwit2X did in earlier versions. But why would you want to activate Segwit only on a certain implementation?
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:38:33
You are probably confusing BIP148 with SWSF.
SWSF is safe because it is a soft fork with 95% requirement for miners support. BIP148 attempts to force SWSF activation by **forking off the regular network** with no support requirements at all. BIP148 is therefore much more risky (than SWSF alone) and as such has **not** been tested before - unless you want to cite the ETH/ETC incident.
HF is risky, chain split is very risky.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:21:04
Segwit2X signals on bit 4 for Segwit **and** 2MB HF. Segwit will be introduced as a soft-fork and the 2 MB hard-fork will follow 3 month later.
You could try and convince miners to wait after Segwit has activated and then to not follow through with the hard-fork (i.e. just start running Core clients again).
Question would be, if a majority of miners would want that, why didn't they just signal Segwit (BIP141) before? If you can only convince a minority of miners to switch back, you will end up with a chain split as well. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:48:20
**BIP148 has &lt;2% client support, &lt;1% hashrate support, &lt;5% community support, 0% exchanges support.**

This is getting complicated. Now certain versions are not valid votes because users would vote differently if they'd only knew better?
I totally agree that those that are aware of the differences and their impact would probably switch to a more specific version, but that doesn't justify to discard their votes.

**Eric Lombrozo**: "What did I do? I did nothing wrong. I am just an individual. I wasn't at the Hong Kong agreement."

UASF does not have the hashrate to be successful. Soft-forks need longer chains to make the legacy network switch.

@_date: 2017-06-23 17:06:01
Despite the evangelism practiced around here by a vocal minority, **BIP148 is not a religion**.
BIP148 is just a method to force Segwit activation - just like Segwit2x.
Once we have Segwit, there is no need for BIP148 anymore.
But of course you are free to fork an altcoin with half of Bitcoin's blocksize. Remember to adjust difficulty or change PoW.
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:56:00
This is probably what you end up with when
- miners want a hard-fork
- the majority of users trusts/runs Core
- Core does not want a hard-fork
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:06:39
The changes introduced by soft forks are accepted by old clients (because they have stricter rules).
Unless miners want to explicitly trigger a split, there won't be one.
This does not apply to BIP148 (which orphans blocks that don't signal Segwit) or Segwit2X (which introduces a HF in ~4 month)
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:58:35
 shows two percentages per proposal. One shows support during the **last week**, one shows support for **today**.

Not sure what you mean by that, right now it looks like the miners are going to follow through with Segwit as a soft-fork. Are you saying that they won't? In that case they also woudn't get their hard-fork, which is bound to the Segwit activation and we would be back to the status quo. Why go through the hassle of Segwit2X then?

Yes, or UASF.
I agree that there seems to be something off between the miners and Core. Not sure if it was because of the Hong Kong agreement or something else happened that we maybe don't know the details of.
Eric reacted very defensively when they talked about the miners losing trust and he was very specific that it wasn't **his fault**. I wondered if he knew more and had somebody else in mind.

@_date: 2017-06-23 11:42:57
I agree, but why would a miner not want bigger blocks?
Also - why do you think a chainsplit is likely at &gt; 80% hashrate?
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:12:23
Hmm... this sounds unnecessarily complex to me.
Miners wanted Segwit + HF in 2016, miner still want Segwit + HF in 2017. Maybe it is not about Segwit and the ASICBoost thing, maybe it is mostly about the HF thing?
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:49:54
Segwit has majority community support but not majority hashrate support.
Soft-forks require majority hashrate support, which SegWit does not have (yet).
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:52:13
Segwit disables the covert ASICBoost variant and Segwit2X does not change that:
Edit, quote:


@_date: 2017-06-25 20:29:27
Got it. So,
- users "decide" that only Segwit blocks are "valid" blocks
- 70% of miners continue to produce non-Segwit blocks, which are "invalid" according to users
- thus the 70% of miners are "splitting" the chain
I really needed a lot of quotes for this one.
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:07:28
Different groups consider different things important. Developers probably care more for decentralization and safety and less for economic metrics or market adoption. And that is totally fine.

Not a chance. You won't get 100% Segwit benefit in 24 hours. But I don't think our conversation adds much to the topic anymore. Let's move on.
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:00:51
Segwit is activated at 95% hashrate support. It currently has 40% hashrate support.
Segwit2x is activated at 80% hashrate support and adds a fork to 2MB, allowing twice the transaction capacity of "regular" Segwit. It currently has 85% hashrate support.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:02:25
SegWit(2X) disables covert AsicBoost.
@_date: 2017-07-09 12:40:52
The important question would be, assuming we could reliably measure it (which we can't), **"how much support would be enough"**? 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%?
You can't get 100% support of a community that allows sybil actors.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:14:41
Okay. Sure.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:00:47
These are not my numbers. I just cite them (incl. those by luke-jr), but could you be a bit more specific? Which numbers are you talking about exactly that are biased or based on a 33 person online survey? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:15:14
Segwit2X will most likely avoid the split threatened by BIP148 on Aug 1st. What remains to be seen is if hashrate will follow through with the hard-fork ~3 month later.
That being said, if Segwit2X fails to activate and 35% of hashrate switches to BIP148 (those that already signal Segwit), BIP148 starts forking off the legacy network by ignoring the remaining 65%, starting a split.
Users now have twice the coins and want to sell them on the exchanges. Exchanges start to list BIP148 chain because they want to earn trading feeds.
The BIP148 chain cannot generate as many blocks as the legacy chain cause it has less hashrate. Thus it won't be able to make use of its soft-fork character because it can't reorg the legacy chain which still follows the longest valid chain.
Now you end up with 2 chains until one slowly and painfully dies...
But to recap, this is quite unlikely because Segwit2X has 85% hashrate support and will most likely activate Segwit before BIP148 can start a split.

Miners and OP were expecting a release in a Core version. Developers coding up proposals did not fullfill that expectation. There is no lie involved. The developers present should not have signed a document that makes demands about "official" core releases. Still, no lies involves.

Not bad, around 2% share of all clients. Let's hope these aren't sybils being respawned again.

This is my take as well.

*Original post has been updated since saltylemon added total nodes/percentages. This post is outdated.*
You know that this is the same site that I quoted and based my calculations on? 
They count 500 enforcing UASF nodes. At 100.000 total nodes (according to Luke-jr*) that turns out to be 0.5%.
1% if you count non-enforcing nodes as well. 
Show me your math, because your source doesn't claim otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:42:24
There is no other option that has even remotely the same amount of support. Segwit, UASF, BU, XT, Classic all weren't able to get a majority of hashrate. Segwit2x has around 85% - 90% right now.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:36:42
According to the  same site, 


There is no economic majority right now (&lt;5%), **the site recommends to not run the client right now**.

You are probably refering to the chain split risk. Based on our discussion [here]( it seems like you have a very different definition of what a chain split is and who caused it than I do.
I supplied sources for the rest of the data, incl. your own node count.
No dishonesty involved on my part. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:47:50
Yes. Version bits 1 (Segwit) and 4 (Segwit2x) are both contributing.

Walk me through it please, how do users (including miners) decide on something?
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:47:01
Now you are mistaking SWSF support for UASF support because both want to activate Segwit. UASF aims to cause a chain split. SWSF does not.  
The community considers the risks of a rushed 3 month HF in Segwit2x to be lower than the risks associated with a UASF chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:05:36
They do what  recommends:


@_date: 2017-06-30 15:15:56
Who should decide on changes to the Bitcoin protocol?
**A) "Community" that is ill defined and can't be measured**






 


**B) Hashrate that doesn't represent the whole community and only cares for rewards**


**C) Exchanges, VCs and bitcoin businesses that don't care for security and decentralization**




**D) Core developers that don't care for economic metrics, market adoption and exchange value**




@_date: 2017-06-07 07:22:11




It seems like you are ignoring hashrate as a factor for risk assessment just for the sake of your argument. But maybe I was unclear so I reiterate my point:
**A SegWit2X (which requires 80% support) is not as risky as a BIP148 chain split (which doesn't require anything).**
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:33:13
Totally agree. This opens up another issue, people trust Core and


So we'd expect users to 
- form a well informed opinion
- create/retrieve/run software that expresses this opinion
- share that software/opinion-pair with the community
If people running nodes favour trust and code stability more than an individual feature, they might run Core without casting their vote. This would skew the results.
On the other hand, having a command-line feature for Core to signal your vote gives a lot of power to Core to decide on which voting options to provide and thus to skew the results.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:23:28
In 90% of the discussions, it doesn't matter if something is a soft-fork, hard-fork or whatever fork. These are terms that specifically deal with how **old clients treat changes of consensus rules**.
So, according to the common definition of a HF, no. But what is your definition of a HF?
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:01:10
You can't get 100% Segwit utilization immediately after activation. You need to create Segwit outputs before you get the space benefit. Creating the Segwit outputs and moving stuff there takes blocks/time.
This is not needed in a HF. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:17:19


Oh, the irony. **User**ASF doesn't need **users**, but it needs hashrate majority from **miners** to make sure that users follow the "U"ASF chain.
Without hashrate majority the users that didn't upgrade will follow the regular chain. Longest valid chain wins.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:11:13
How exactly would you distribute the votes?
How do you account for sybil attacks? (i.e. how can I vote anonymously but now twice)
How do you assign weights to bitcoin holding amount or age? (e.g. should someone with 0.01 BTC have the same voting weight as someone with 5.00 BTC?)
Are miners (which probably hold more coins than average users) also users?
**Currently there is no option to let users decide directly because there is no reliable way to measure user votes. Best option is to provide multiple options (chains) and let them buy what they consider best.**
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:32:41


Exactly. 30% is negligible.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:23:03
Exactly my point :-) Your code does not care for miner or economic majority support, it has no requirement for support at all, it only cares about timestamps:
    if ( (nMedianTimePast &gt;= 1501545600) &amp;&amp;  // Tue 01 Aug 2017 00:00:00 UTC
    (nMedianTimePast &lt;= 1510704000) &amp;&amp;  // Wed 15 Nov 2017 00:00:00 UTC
SegWit2X on the other hand requires **80% support** (see my code snippet).
More support means less risks.
This does not mean that UASF does not have any merrits - but it's still carries more risk in comparison.
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:49:07
Thanks for the detailed response. I mostly agree.
Assuming that in these numbers
- there were no sybil attacks involved
- the weights were somehow "correct"
- the website represent "true reality"
- those that were not represented (e.g. transacting or bitcoin holding users that don't run nodes) would not shift the result
I would form the "rough" opinion that there is no "true" consensus right now that miners could follow.
Furthermore, a user running Core probably only wants Segwit when it reaches 95% of hashrate - otherwise they would run another/forked version with different settings (like BIP148).
Even further, there was confusion about the meaning of supporting/being prepared/being ready for Segwit (e.g. signaling readiness without advocating it). Counting only the "support" votes for Segwit you get


I am not saying that none of those being ready for Segwit support it, I am just saying that this is all too messy to be the basis for a decision process that affects such a large community and industry. Too many sybil attack risks, too many trust issues, too many weights and another decision process on how to get these weights, too many actors not being able to vote, ... In short: If you cannot create (* and agree on) a spec for a process, you don't have a process.
Would you argue that this paints a clear enough picture for miners to know what the decision is? Because I would not feel safe to make a decision based on this fuzzy data, even less so when it affects a multi-billion dollar industry.
Edit: Few ninja edits, but you were too fast :-)

- exchanges could announce support for UASF
- miners could announce support for UASF
- BIP148+ could include replay protection or exchanges could announce to provide it
- tutorials on how to manually split coins for UASF could be shared and discussed

This is indeed very concerning.
Another example: **"BIP148 doesn't cause a chain split, the miners not running it do."**
Luke-jr literally [said](


There is probably a certain mindset involved that makes this reasonable but I fail to grasp it.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:42:09
miners continuing to produce non-Segwit blocks would be blocking others, right?
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:04:56
Still it takes time for the majority of users to move their stuff to new Segwit outputs. **It is not instant like you claimed.**
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:35:09
Don't forget the few thousand sybil UASF nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:19:30
So, a group of people signing a piece of paper is sufficient to transfer power from the community to them?


I like this definition. The problem is how do we measure what the majority agrees on?
Node clients, developer support, businesses support, exchanges support, hashrate, Reddit pools, retweets, ...


We don't know what the community wants. 95% run node clients that let miners decide.


I agree, but most "people" want Bitcoin to change. Different groups want different changes. Deciding on who gets to decide automatically makes it about power/influence. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:22:03
Yes. Even worse, we can't agree on how to agree on changes. (i.e. how to implement a process to find consensus).
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:27:34
My point is that you can explain the different expectations about the HKA based on its poor wording and a misunderstanding about capabilities (i.e. a few core developers cannot promise a release in a core version).
No need to accuse anybody of lying unless you are right and OP was also present at the meeting (which I doubt).
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:37:09


What? This is not about bigger blocks, but about transitioning periods.
But again, if you want to discuss HF vs SF:
With a HF you get an **immediate** blocksize increase, with SWSF you get a blocksize increase **dependent on Segwit utilization** (i.e. the amount of Segwit transactions in a block).
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:03:29
Thanks for doing the math.
Biggest risk with Segwit2X is that we won't get out the hard fork in time - it is a bit ironic that in case that happens one would have to distribute another hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:59:02

Blockstream president and *a few individual* Core developers were also fine with it during the Hong Kong agreement.
UASF forced an ultimatum which left little time for development and review which is indeed risky. But assuming Segwit2X activates successfully (including HF) we get what we all wanted a year and a half ago.
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:00:05
Uh... I'll will also paste my response from over there:
The agreement states literally:


None of your "proposals" apply, cause they weren't released in Core (because they were just that, proposals).
But given the poor wording on the HKA it not worth to worry about it. 
NYA is a forked version of Bitcoin Core that includes a HF and Segwit. Exactly what HKA intended, so let's focus on NYA.
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:00:52
Let me rephrase it:
Miners are expected to follow whatever the users decide. How do the miners get this information?
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:07:13
So you'd say that Segwit2X (NY) and HK are both not binding agreements?
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:09:59
Segwit2X is risky because after it soft-forks it introduces a hard-fork which **requires everybody who wants to remain on-chain to update**.
It is risky because it has to be rushed due to the UASF ultimatum on Aug 1st. Still, Segwit2X has more aggregated support than Segwit or UASF/BIP148. Right now it looks like the best bet to get us out of the no-scaling status quo.
For a more detailed comparison, look [here](
@_date: 2017-06-29 09:44:12
Please see the neighbouring [post]( of mine that gives an example on how soft-forks can cause chain splits. Would love to hear your response to that. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:57:55


No idea where they got that from. BIP148 will activate Segwit regardless of nodes, users and miners. But it will only reorg the regular chain when they achieve hashrate majority.
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:31:19


This sounds interesting. How come? Isn't luke-jr's count based on the version string which includes uacomments that UASF uses as well? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:39:16
To be fair, it has also 30% of economic/community support (according to coin.dance weighting).
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:34:07
For all your addresses, for all of my addresses, and everybody else. But you still won't get the total Segwit benefit at that point.
You have to wait until all the transactions that end up in a block are **spending from these Segwit outputs**.
Even if you could
- have everybody install Segwit compatible wallets and 
- have them move all their funds into Segwit adressess and 
- have them start spending from these
- and have magical 1 minute block times instead of 10minutes
you would get a massive backlog that won't clear anytime soon and you still don't get 100% of Segwit blocksize increase.
**Only transactions spending Segwit outputs get the block size increase. Once Segwit is activated, all funds will still be in non-Segwit adressess. Moving them to Segwit output takes time.**
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:55:06
This does not support your point.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:49:59
Yeah, the coinbase text just signals intent to signal. Signaling via bit 4 should start in July.
But the activation threshold of 80% is in the current alpha version (269 out of the last 336 blocks IIRC).

How can it be faster than immediate?
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:46:29
Segwit2x will check if at least 269 out of the last 336 blocks (~80%) **signal Segwit (bit 1) or Segwit2x (bit 4)**.
If this happens then Segwit2x waits **another 336 blocks** after which it starts orphaning all blocks that don't signal Segwit **(bit 1)**.
This in turn should
- trigger the 95% threshold of old/regular Segwit clients, which would lock in and **activate SegWit after about 4 weeks (4.032 blocks)** and after that
- **activate a 2MB HF after about 3 months (12.960 blocks)**
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:44:06




That also applies to Segwit2X. And it doesn't matter if a proposal enables magical unicorns if you can't get agreement to activate it.
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:03:14
Let's say 35% of hashrate switches to BIP148 (those that already signal Segwit), the remaining 65% don't care, don't "[...] do anything, just leave the soft fork be".
BIP148 starts forking off the network by ignoring the 65%, starting a split. Users now have twice the coins and want to sell them on the exchanges. Exchanges start to list BIP148 chain because they want to earn trading feeds. The BIP148 chain cannot generate as many blocks as the legacy chain cause it has less hashrate. Thus it won't be able to make use of its soft-fork character because it can't reorg the legacy chain which still follows the longest valid chain. Now you continue to have two chains and a whole lot of chaos in front of you until one dies a slow and painful death. This is a chain split.
I agree that you need less hashrate for a soft-fork than you'd need for a hard-fork but you still need **at least a hashrate majority to ensure a soft-fork reorg**.
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:15:11
I didn't claim that you supported an 8MB HF in 2016. I claimed that you + other Core dev supported Segwit + 2MB HF during the Hong Kong agreement.

@_date: 2017-06-24 09:40:13


Either miners are organized and update their software or you are stuck with the status quo. I don't like Bitcoin in the current status quo.


If the Blockstream president did not represent all of Blockstream and the Core developers did not represent all of Core, then why should F2Pool represent all the miners?
If this was an agreement between individual developers and individual miners, how could F2Pool's signaling of Classic break the agreement between all the other "individuals"?
Again, HKA is so poorly worded that we shouldn't waste more time about who broke it.
**The then president of Blockstream, notable individual Core developers and a majority of miners were all in favour of Segwit and a 2MB HF.**
Let's try again using NYA, it is rushed because of UASF - yes, but we got Segwit and a 2MB HF in a forked version of Core. We got &gt;80% hashrate. Let's do this.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:25:24
You know that they are signaling for Segwit2X which disables covert ASICBoost, right?
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:15:30
I agree that you can get a "rough" opinion out of it, but
- it is not safe to rely on a single website as the publisher of the voting results

And even if you could get around the sybil attacks how do you account for small businesses with less economic impact vs big exchanges?

Not sure if I get your point.
If you want to disrupt Segwit2X, lobby miners to not follow through with the hard-fork after Segwit gets activated.
If you want to disrupt Core, lobby miners to follow through with SegWit2X.
If you want to disrupt BIP148, lobby miners to follow through with Segwit and/or SegWit2X.
There is little you can do on the user/non-mining nodes side that will sway implementation popularity.

I agree (see my recommendation about selling coins).
Of course you would need all of the following
- exchanges listing UASF
- min. UASF hashrate to allow transactions happening or a UASF PoW hard fork
- replay protection or manual coin split
- large amount of BTCCore being sold for BTCUASF

What are you talking about? BIP148 is a soft-fork to enable another soft-fork (BIP141). It will fork off the regular network on Aug 1st.
As a soft-fork, it needs hashrate majority to make sure that the regular chain is shorter than the soft-fork chain.
If it is unable to reorg the regular chain a chain split remains or BIP148 dies.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:06:27


Without majority hashrate, both will lead to a chain split.

BIP148 aims to activate SegWit. If Segwit gets activated by BIP141 or Segwit2X, there will be no need for BIP148. 
Also Core doesn't want BIP148 because it risks a chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:32:13


No, not a single exchange expressed support for BIP148, while two expressed support for Segwit2X.


No, unless BIP148 gathers majority community support (incl. miners) they will be locked out, their transactions and rewards won't reorg into the main chain.

is talking about a scenario where BIP148 starts because Segwit has **not** been already activated (either through BIP141 or Segwit2X) and has very low miner support (i.e. hashrate).
It would fail to activate Segwit because it won't be able to mine the required number of blocks for activation in time before it expires.
But then UASF/BIP148 can hard-fork the difficulty or the PoW... /s
BIP148 has currently &lt;1% miner support.
@_date: 2017-06-26 09:56:30
This is my impression as well.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:28:10
The repo is at  it is being tested on testnet5 and it currently has ~90% hashrate support. If it activates it will trigger Segwit as a soft-fork and 3 month later a 2MB hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:31:16
Luke-jrs most probable response to this: "Segwit2X is a hard-fork and hard-forks **always** cause a chain split regardless of hash-rate."
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:57:59


I agree that the term might be loaded. It should convey that it is only dependent on the date and can't be "stopped" by other actors (at least that's what I hear from BIP148 proponents). What would you suggest as a replacement? I will replace it with "Fixed Date".




Soft-forks and hard-forks cause chain splits when they don't reach majority hashrate. I know you don't agree, but I am not going to recreate the same discussion we had [here](


I didn't say it does, feel free to add more sources.




Not according to the sources I listed and know of. If you claim otherwise please cite your sources.


I didn't say it does, feel free to add your own metric.


According to [3] 11 out of 21 Core devs rate BIP148 acceptable/prefer. That is 52%, since the label "Medium".




You, Peter Todd, Matt Corallo, Johnson Lau and Cory Fields supported Segwit2MB in 2016. I would rate all of you as quite influential at the time which is why I rated it "Medium". At least the 5 of you are a bit more than "Zero".
I agree that Segwit2X is not supported by any active Core dev - I wasn't sure about being considered a Core dev. I will change the row to "Active Core dev support".
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:38:42




I agree that nodes must update if they wan't to play along. But why do you think a chainsplit is likely at &gt; 80% hashrate (Segwit2x has around 85% - 90% right now)?

A) The **"community"** that we cannot measure
B) The **hashrate** that only consists of miners

How do you make a decision based on that?
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:35:45
Maybe they consider the benefits of Segwit and a 2MB HF to be of greater value than the 20% electricity savings with ASICBoost.
The fact remains: **Segwit and Segwit2X disable the covert use of ASICBoost**, if you like Bitmain or not.

Yeah, consensus in anonymous, decentralized systems is a bitch.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:38:32
Yes, I think this is probably the right way to parse his comment, from his perspective:
- There is **overwhelming** support for BIP148 in the community
- Thus the community can decide that all non-Segwit blocks become invalid
- Miners continue to mine (now invalid) non-Segwit blocks
- Thus miners are responsible for the split by mining invalid blocks
Still don't see how he can generalize from that to "Softforks never split the chain".
Less than 1% run BIP148 nodes, less than 5% of the weighted community support it, half of the Core developers don't want it, I honestly have no clue where he got the impression that BIP148 has overwhelming support in the community.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:43:42
According to these weights, what would you consider is the current decision of the users/community/businesses? 
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:20:00
Ah, good one. :-)
Well the argument was a bit dated and from long before that tweet. But at least they share a common ground for increased adoption and - of course - higher prices.
You seem to know quite a few of his tweets. Does any give an indication as to why a hard-fork is so important to him besides "twice the fees"?
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:00:09
It's a method to force activation of Segwit. It will activate on Aug 1st regardless of actual support by the economic majority and might lead to a chain split. Please see [this]( for more details or use the search function.

@_date: 2017-06-29 10:49:53
I honestly have huge respects for you as a programmer and Bitcoin developer. There are probably few people that know the ins and outs of Segwit as good as you.
It is important that people with less knowledge can rely on those with more in order to better form an opinion.
I also believe that you have best intentions at heart to end this stalemate and that you believe that BIP148 is the best way out of it.
But I also think that you seriously oversell BIP148 and downplay its risks which makes it difficult for other people to form a "balanced" opinion. I am afraid that this will skew peoples perception and lead to further division.  
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:17:07
The schedule is not only rather aggressive but borderline reckless.
It is being rushed in order to avoid the chain split risk that is being caused by UASF/BIP148 on Aug 1st.
It is currently being tested on testnet5 by miners; based on the lack of issues in this regard I assume that they don't use github to handle the feedback.
The fact that "only" the activation method has to be established right now (without breaking anything else) and that the code is basically 99.98% unchanged Core gives me a bit of hope though. Miners can't afford to screw this up so hopefully they are going to test it very thoroughly.

Let's not conflate the two:
Segwit has widespread support amongst users and developers (95% run Segwit ready clients).
BIP148 has no widespread support anywhere (1% hashrate, 1% nodes, 5% weighted community support).


Segwit2X has widespread support amongst miners (86% hashrate support), medium support amongst the community (48% weighted support) and no support from (active) Core developers.
See source for these numbers [here](

Cool. So even less difference between NYA and HKA.

Are you saying that miners didn't want Segwit + 2MB HF in February 2016?
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:11:33
You are mistaken. Segwit2X does not change Segwits behaviour with regards to ASICBoost. The covert variant will be made inefficient.
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:43:53


The former Blockstream president and a few Core developers tried to get Segwit + 2MB in February 2016, called the [Hong Kong agreement]( Didn't work out so well.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:31:54
To be fair, we had a HK agreement once that promised Segwit and a 2MB HF. But sure, the dates in Segwit2X have been set to account for the UASF split. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:46:01


None of your "proposals" apply, cause they weren't released in Core (because they were just that, proposals).
But given the poor wording on the HKA it not worth to worry about it. 
NYA is a forked version of Bitcoin Core that includes a HF and Segwit. Exactly what HKA intended, so let's focus on NYA.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:19:51
Current support is around 85% for Segwit2X vs 35% for Segwit.
Miners think that a 2MB blocksize increase will earn them more.
Since Segwit is a soft-fork a chain split probably won't happen once Segwit2x is activated. The hard-fork that is scheduled 3 month later bears considerably more risks (although at 85%-90% hashrate support this is still unlikely). 
Worst case scenario would be that Segwit2x gets activated and 20%-40% of miners don't follow through with the hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-30 21:54:54
I agree, just to clarify: the 95.000 nodes will follow the longest valid chain, which will probably be Segwit2X up until November. Let's see what the hard-fork brings.

Miners probably expect higher rewards with 2MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:32:56
So they wanted Segwit first because it was beneficial for them. Then they stopped wanting Segwit because ASICBoost was more beneficial to them. And now they start wanting it again because they need to save face. 
Did I get it right? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:14:11


Interesting, they started to signal Segwit2X even before Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:14:08
There is probably going to be a majority of hashrate behind the HF which will make it very likely but it is not 100% guaranteed. The hashrate that signalled Segwit (before Segwit2x) might switch back which accounts for roughly 30%.
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:29:21
You mistake the community's consensus **to avoid UASF for support**. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:42:13

Support for BIP148 amongst Core devs listed [here]( is around 50%.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:33:12
Ah, you are talking about a chain split.
As long as the 2MB HF has not happened yet, the longer Segwit2x chain will be considered valid to old clients because of its soft-fork architecture.
Once the 2MB HF is triggered, a chain split might happen, based on how much hashrate Segwit2x has at that point. The more hashrate, the less likely is a permanent split.
If you want to play it safe, make sure to have your coins out of any exchanges/web wallets and in cold storage that you control.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:29:47


But the question was who supports it, not who doesn't.
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:51:36
They (BWPool) also started signaling NYA :-) It will increase percentages for both, Segwit and Segwit2X.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:46:46
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:25:14
You are actively promoting a BIP148 chain split and at the same time think a SegWit2x HF is too risky?
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:40:31
I agree 100% on the technical level. I am concerned about the increased usage of rhetorics to paint BIP148 in a certain light.
BIP148 assumes that **the vote is already over in favour of Segwit**. BIP9 is for coordinating implementation timings only and **not** for voting on consensus. Since there is consensus for BIP141, not implementing it is "preventing". Thus it is ok for BIP148 to orphan non-BIP141 signaling blocks to stop them from "preventing" it.
The issue here is that the community has "decided" to let miners "vote" on consensus changes using BIP9 and 65% of miners did not "vote" for BIP141.
Ignoring votes that don't follow what you perceive to be consensus in order to reach consensus is questionable on its own.
But arguing that ignoring votes you don't like is a good thing because it "**just**" stops others from preventing your desired voting result is rhetorics. 
As long as you don't have an agreement on what the actual consensus is, the other side can claim just the same, we don't gather new information and we only further the divide.
Even worse, people may think that BIP148 is without risks and "**just** stops bad miners preventing what we all want". This may lead to more BIP148 supporters that are not fully aware of the risks involved and lose money. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:36:54
Let's hope the rest of the 90% hashrate support have it.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:47:46
This is not a (complete) process. What is the result? How is the result published?
Can I get a BIP on that?
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:36:04
With 5% BWPool is taking Segwit2X to 90%.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:47:51


This is my impression as well. If luke-jr numbers are correct there are 95.000 nodes that are fine with the status quo. If you think node share is important it will be difficult to beat those numbers (for BIP148 or Segwit2X).
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:54:52
Let's assume Segwit2X fails and BIP148 gets around 30% hashrate.
Are you seriously saying that the 70% **not** joining in are the ones causing the split?
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:13:34
On the client level: Signaling. (e.g. run Core client with UASF uacomment)
On the business level: Meatspace.

Alright, so for those looking for that info:
(Core developer) for BIP148 and (former? Core developer) for Segwit2X.
I am not sure if they qualify as "serious scientists" but maybe a quick look in their history helps.
@_date: 2017-06-29 09:20:32
Sounds super-duper, let me translate for newcomers:
Let's say a new bill (Segwit) is proposed and people agree that 95% of votes are needed for it to become law.
Voting starts but it only gains 35% instead of 95%.
**Next voting round starts but now a bouncer (BIP148) prevents those against the bill from entering the building and casting their votes.**
The guy behind the bouncer (luke-jr) proclaims: "You don't have to be in favour of the bill, you just have to vote for it. In fact, shame on you, by wanting to vote against the bill you prevent it from becoming law and thus prevent other people from benefiting from it."
BIP148 orphans blocks that don't signal (vote) for Segwit. Miners are free to create non-Segwit blocks as long as they still vote for Segwit.
To be clear, Segwit is a very good thing that should be activated. But let's also be clear about the methods and risks associated with forced activation methods like Segwit2X and BIP148. 
Saying things like "it just doesn't allow miners to prevent other people from supporting and using it" is political rhetorics and borderline deceptive.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:06:13


There is no support for either right now (&lt;1% miners, &lt;1% users, &lt;5% weighted community).
If you want to transact on such a chain, please take into account that it may be subject to long block times (multiple hours or longer per block) and a slow death which will wipe out all its transactions (and rewards).
With no support from miners and economic nodes, BIP148 is a death trap.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:19:11
This might be, but it still won't help us out of the status quo.
Miners are the actors that are most heavily financially invested in Bitcoin. I would expect them to act in their own perceived best financial interest.

They don't need to because Segwit2x is a soft-fork for the next 4 month.
Up until then only miners need to update and 85% are claiming to do so.
We'll see about node support for the following hard-fork. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:11:21




How big would blocks have to become before you would consider this an issue? I doubt that 2MB blocks will have a notable impact on decentralization.


Why would miners mine a minority chain with &lt; 20%? The old clients will fork off, of course, but it won't be a (continous) chain split if nobody mines the old chain anymore.
Old clients would be forced to update either to the new chain or adjust difficulty and/or PoW on the old one.
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:40:09


Of course there is.

Almost as bad as putting strings in uacomments. But at least coinbase texts can't be sybil attacked.
You'll never know if they actually follow through after signaling. Let's see if we are going to have Segwit in a few weeks and a 2MB HF 3 months later.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:28:41
I also don't have an issue with Core merging back the hard-fork.
AFAIK they are primarily against it because the hard-fork is rushed and not because they are generally against Segwit2MB. So Core is playing it safe (as they have in the past) which is totally fine.
If the hard-fork fails and we get a chain split they are the ones that are allowed to say "told you so".
If the hard-fork is successful they can say "phew, you dodged a bullet here" and merge it back. No hard feelings.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:13:05
Their blocks don't suddenly become invalid just because 30% think they are.
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:21:50
I was also wondering why they didn't create a BIP for Segwit2X, maybe can elaborate?
But still, Segwit2X is in alpha-testing phase and IMO too far ahead to still be considered a *vague proposal*.
Why are you saying that there is no signaling threshold for Segwit2X? It will activate at 80%.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:53:54
So, in my example above, they wouldn't block others?
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:22:27
100% agree, I didn't mean that it dies without hashrate.
I meant that it needs hashrate to reorg. If it is unable to reorg then we either have a continous chain split **or** the BIP148 chain dies. But it won't overtake the regular chain (as soft-forks are supposed to) without hashrate.
