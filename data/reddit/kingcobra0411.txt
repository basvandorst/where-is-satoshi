I agree. But at the same time I think has to be encouraged. This is the way we get cryptos to the people and then a market would start accepting it.
Apart from that, its truly decentralized. There are 100s of people working totally remote. So it makes us be and do what we want to at the same time working on cool tech.
If I had some cash reserves I could have handled my situation better. But eventually I want this culture to succeed.

I don’t understand why people are so panicked.
After 2011 MtGox crash, we wish it would be awesome Bitcoin get backs up to $1000 again. It did.
Around June 2017 if someone told Bitcoin will go maintain around $5000 averagely in 2018 no one would have believed.
Guys its $4500 if you bought at high like $10k that doesn’t give you any credit to complain.
People are here since bitcoin was $10 just 7 years ago and now its $4500 which is super great growth.
Very sure in another 7 years it will be $100k atleast. Stay, watch, earn.
Edit  2014 MtGox crash

not a btc hodler. I get paid in crypto. Thats my only source of income. from the moment I got paid and trying to convert to dollars I lost 1200$ of my monthly salary. I dont know what to do of this.

lol.. not just rent i have a whole lot of other stuff going around which also includes my marriage expenses. so i quickly convert them as soon as I receive my pay because the conversion from their side is done on the payday only. 
but still what happened yesterday was from the moment I got the coins and had to move to exchanges to convert and then to localbitcoins to sell. in that mean time I lost a lot.
thanks :)

yeah i agree. this month particularly very difficult mate. even with my expected income I would have just made ends meet. now with $1200 hole in it. i have no idea. just saving whats available. i dont have much time to wait for it to recover.
