Well for point 1.  there is a differene between buying a lot of btc at very low prices and just creating xrp out of thin air.  Everybody had the chance to buy btc at 0.1$ but not everybody had the chance to get xrp for free.

You would be surprised if you see how many times some randoms on 4chan nailed it. They were shilling chainlink for months as their open secret/inside joke when we were at a few cents and look where we are now.   That DB story tho is complete BS

No look at all the banke who already have banned btc purchases. None of them had a bankrun.

Woouu settle down old friend. Seeing your previous post about how much bitcoin you need for lambo Im pretty sure you’re new to this space so instead of harassing other people. You better try out google instead of wasting bandwidth with your usless question that could be answered in seconds (which I did btw)
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:02:53
That’s exactly what you asked and if you don’t like the answer go to r/cryptocurrency

Well but the thing is they won’t go down without a fight and they have the bigger lobbythan bitcoin. For some people it might be actually pretty hard to trade btc p2p and that’s what I said bitcoin wont die but it probably crashes 90% or more.

First you need to understand what a mining pool is. You can’t BUY a mining pool since it’s just a pool of miners all around the world who are mining together to increased their chances. If something shady happens with that pool it will break in pieces and the miners will form a new one.
@_date: 2019-08-09 14:54:36
At least add bitcoin solves this to the title
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:05:11
Yeah just realized 90% crash is only 1000$ ����

Well sucks to say but the first an biggest Angel investor was roger ver
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:56:17
Because the last bitcoin they would buy would cost them 100billion $. Cause that would be mine ������

Ok Imagine the following:
In a few years lets say 5-10 the central banks have all cutt their rates to zero or negative there is a huge currency war between all the different countries which might escalate even more in a physical conflict all assets crash stocks bonds AND even the USD since its standard as world reserve currency begins to fade. All of a sudden the very wealthy in this world realize that even if they dump all their stocks and bonds and other assets the only thing they get for is usd and that itself is collapsing. Do what are you gonna do? Gold? Well great but soon you find out that most of the gold thats traded today is paper gold which is basically an IOU between banks. So if the millionaire wants to take his gold in his own bunker the bank tells him well your 100000 oz of gold is not here sorry.  ������ so the Millionair thinks if there is a possibility to store huge amounts of wealth in something that can’t be confiscated and thats the size of a ledger nano that he can put in his pocket and go with it wherever he wants.  Soo??? Soon he realizes well there are only 21mio btc but there are more than 21mio millionaires in this world. So theoretically if every millionaire is coming to the same conclusion and is willing to put his whole wealth into btc. There are more people WHO ARE ABLE to pay 1mio for a single bitcoin then there will be bitcoins.

POS only replaces the act of POW everything else can stay the same. So also on POS there can be fees and newly „mined“ coins. There are a few coins who already have Issued all their tokens . ( mostly DAGs)

Bitfinex alwas has a huuuge long overhang. Like 75-85% longs. I think its some kind uf funding rates arbitrage game. They might be long on finex and short on an other xchange and cash in the basis on both sides.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:17:49
@_date: 2019-10-19 16:21:25
Yeah but you probably don’t have such a return on btc over the next 10years again. Maybe gold can 5x again Who knows but usually history doesn’t predict anything.

I will because if you have a fix amount to invest it clearly matters. If you’re able to buy 1 btc or 1.25 btc with the same amount of fiat is a lot of money if we are at 100k.
