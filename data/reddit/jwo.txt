So silly but this one made me laugh. And I completely agree with him.

Well, it didn't say that exactly, but what it said was confusing.


So according to the previous guidance, miners would qualify as money transmitters if they sell their mined bitcoin for dollars. It's a strange distinction to make, that a person who sells bitcoins for dollars becomes a money transmitter only in the case that their bitcoins were obtained through mining. I think they just didn't quite understand how the system works.
This new ruling seems to make it clear that simply mining bitcoin does not make someone a money transmitter, even if they do later sell bitcoin for dollars.

That's about how long it takes for the banks to process the transfer of the $100. Selling BTC for $ has the same delay. It has nothing to do with Coinbase, it's the banking system.

Exactly. I've made several small donations to various entities who deserved it because it takes me literally 10 seconds to copy their bitcoin address, type an amount, and send. I never would have done it if I had to register on some website, enter my email/name/address/credit-card/etc.
I'm guessing it would be difficult to claim these donations as tax deductions, but I think charities could still raise plenty of money in small donations from people who don't care about getting a tax deduction.

It's based on gmaxwell's "2-way peg" idea. You can move bitcoin to/from a sidechain at any time at the same fixed conversion rate, and the only way to create currency on the sidechain is to move bitcoin to it.

If it became necessary to change the hash function, the miners would no longer be "the miners", they would just be owners of now useless SHA256 hardware and we'd all be mining on our CPUs again.

Full Tilt and the other big sites accepting US customers were employing complex systems of funneling money around between different entities in order to avoid banks blocking their transfers in accordance with the UIGEA.
It was pretty clear that what they were doing was illegal, the hope was just that the government would give up on trying to enforce it. With bitcoin there's at least a plausible argument to be made that it doesn't violate US law.

This is not a problem with the sidechains proposal. Sidechains use bitcoin as their currency, anyone can own currency on a sidechain by moving their bitcoin over to it, and move it back onto the main Bitcoin blockchain later.

Bitpay or Coinbase are probably better options, and can handle the conversion to dollars for you.
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:53:27
That would be KYC/AML, TMI/FML is something different
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:56:46
There are services that do that but Paypal isn't one of them. Bitpay and Coinbase both let you accept bitcoin payments and convert them into USD to be sent to your bank account.

The site's been working fine for me today and they seem to have been taking buy and sell orders all day. I can't say for sure but I'd guess that something went wrong with their 2FA system and it locked you out for attempting it too many times.

It's bizarre that we still know absolutely nothing after all this time. But there's also an investigator appointed by Japanese authorities due to the bankruptcy declaration there, they're still investigating before releasing any information.

So it's legal under Colorado law. But I wouldn't want to be operating this if it gets bigger and the federal government takes notice.

Coinbase's API does have limited specific-permission-based authentication designed for things just like this.

That graph shows exponential growth, it's linear when graphed on a logarithmic scale. And it's definitely a somewhat better metric of real economic activity than raw number of transactions.

Looks like their system does have the ability to set up automatic recurring payments, provided the user doesn't cancel it: 
But that's using their own system outside of the Bitcoin protocol, so it only works for Coinbase users.

And the donors are 100% anonymous. Keeping records on donations doesn't require personal information from everyone who gave $5.

Coinbase gets a lot of extra credibility because it's funded by several famous venture capitalists and is based within the US. There's essentially no risk of the company intentionally doing anything illegal, and it's safe to assume they're pretty competent.

People pay a much higher markup at localbitcoins all the time. If this lets people buy bitcoin with a credit card and get it pretty quickly I could see people doing it.
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:42:07
Didn't the bots dump a large amount of bitcoin towards the end, probably for substantially less on average than they bought it for? After dumping the bitcoin on the exchange it's bitcoin that Mt.Gox owes to people, and the USD they lost in the process of buying high and selling low is absorbed by the fake USD they added to the system. They had problems with USD withdrawals from their system long before the bitcoin withdrawal problems, which suggests that they had a shortage of real USD before they ran out of bitcoin. We also don't know how much bitcoin they still have.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:48:06
That does make it look pretty complicated. Really all you need to do is have a machine to run it on, forward port 8333 to the machine, install and run bitcoind.

That is not the purpose of sidechains at all. Sidechains allow people to implement innovative new ideas using the bitcoin currency without the need to modify the core Bitcoin protocol and software to support them. I don't think a sidechains implementation would even have much effect on Litecoin or Dogecoin, because they don't really have any exciting new features that would be worth copying in the form of a sidechain.
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:16:49
They're not buying bitcoin, but most of the investment is a bet that the number of people using bitcoin will (eventually) go way up. All the hoarding and investing in bitcoin itself is also making the same bet, on the assumption that a large influx of users will drive the price way up. Unless that assumption is wrong, if the investors win then the holders of bitcoin win.

It's more efficient when you replace fiat transfers with bitcoin transfers, not when you add it to them.

Seems that Bitpay assumes the risk. I'm assuming they have a system in place to detect double spend attempts being broadcast on the network.

The law passed by the US a few years ago mostly deals with regulating bank transfers to and from online gambling providers. As far as I understand, using bitcoin makes most if not all of the provisions of the law not apply.

1) Customer sends fiat to Coinbase
2) Coinbase converts fiat to bitcoin then back to fiat
3) Coinbase sends fiat to merchant.
The Bitcoin step is completely unnecessary, they would just skip that step, and at that point they're Paypal.
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:45:27
Not anonymous, international bank transfers are a lot more difficult and expensive and slow than Bitcoin, pretty sure Paypal charges significant fees for currency conversion.

Now that's just silly. If there's a consensus hard fork and the rest of the network switches to an increased block size, I seriously doubt you intend to destroy your own business overnight on principle by refusing to use the new rules.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:23:19
There are so many reasons why this would never actually happen 250 years from now. But if everyone's software somehow still had this bug with only 10 years left before the final block reward it could be a problem.

Probably downvoted because this isn't about manipulation by bots, the bots were buying bitcoin using money that didn't actually exist, that's a much more serious problem.

The rules of bitcoin are set by economic consensus, not by the developers of the "official implementation". This is exactly how the bitcoin system is supposed to work.
