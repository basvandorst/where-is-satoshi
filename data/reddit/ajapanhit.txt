No... It's really worst support now it have been so many days but till now I am not listening anything from XAPO. I also sent message to Xapo support executive u/jessiexapo on reddit before 2 days but she is also not replying. Is there anyone here who can help me otherwise I will have to consider XAPO as scam and forget my money.

If anyone purchase the whole Bitcoin then there will be no value of that Bitcoin like there are thousands of Crypto available in market. It's all demand and supply game.

I am totally agree with that Xapo is very slow, and have worst support I have ever seen. Although WB21 has very poor technical platform, you know their site page crash so many times and even takes time to load.

Yes I agree with this. No can define... But if you are planning to long term FD then you should invest in BTC I am sure you will get higher ROI.

I am really tired with XAPO... it's been already 5 days from I purchased the that Bitcoins, I have already complet 2nd level account verification formality... a few minutes ago I received mail from Xapo saying that.. "I took a look at your account and can see that due to your recent account activity, the funds that you recently bought with us and are trying to send out of your account will be on hold for at least 72 business hours from now while our risk team assesses them. In the meantime, you can cancel any pending transactions that you may have and instead transfer them in between different currencies within your Xapo account. 
Thanks for your patience and understanding as this is for security purposes!".... what's the problem with Xapo... from today's onwards I don't believe in XAPO....  if your intense is really to help me then please sort out this matter within 12 hours.
