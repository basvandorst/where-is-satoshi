Incentivizing nodes is already happening, with DASH. Solves lots of problems.
Nodes process anonymity functions, instant confirmation functions, prevent Sybil attacks through collateral, while earning % of the block rewards for services rendered.

I got PayPalled earlier this year.  Same story as above.  I took them to small claims court and beat their ass.  They eventually paid me in full + court costs.  I'm living proof that it's possible.

"Intel factories, the documents suggested, were responsible for at least two generations of 21 bitcoin mining chips, a 0.57 w/GH 22nm FinFET chip (codenamed CyrusOne) and a 0.22 w/GH 22nm chip (codenamed Brownfield)."
OK, let's assume that Intel can HALF again the next 21 chip.  How about 0.11 w/GH.  If electricity is $.10/KwH, the chip will fall below break even by Halloween.  IF it was hashing today.  That's the ENTIRE reward.  25% of that...

PayPal tried to fuck me over last year while "protecting" the buyer of my mining rig.  He got free use of the miner and a full refund several months later.  I took them to court and beat their ass.
