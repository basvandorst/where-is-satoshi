This was one of the first questions I asked when coming to the bitcoin world.
See people's opinions here:
@_date: 2012-12-18 03:26:52
that's the main thing, if I saw someone accepting Paypal donations, there's very little chance I would donate, and they usually have it so you need to donate $5+ to make it meaningful.  Bitcoin is so much better for donating, I would happily send someone a couple bitcents but never would I pull out my credit card and want to send someone money that way.  I know when I accept transactions on Paypal I can see almost any info that I want about the person, not sure how it works for donating, but if I can see that person's address, phone number, name, all that info, just because they sent me money?  Well if I am donating $0.02 to someone, and they can just steal my identity, that's not right.  Bitcoin = anonymous = greatness.  
And that little bit of extra clutter on their website would go a long way.  Having a Paypal donation button on a blog seems pretty tacky to me, a Bitcoin donation button beside it is definitely hella-stylish, and if they posted accepting Bitcoin donations somewhere, they would get a mini slurry of visitors to check them out to see what they are all about, I don't see any harm in that, in fact the extra attention is worth more than the sum of the donations anyway.  
@_date: 2012-12-13 19:03:57

I would spend my last 75 bucks on Bitcoins.  The plan probably sounded pretty good in his head but 75x3=225 + bounced payment fees, they're $40 at my bank so an extra $80 on top of that is like 300 bones at least.  Maybe he had $150 and spending half his money on Bitcoins, the other $75 on foods, totally plausible.  I would eat mr. noodles and spend the difference on Bitcoins, but that's just me, I can't say it's a great idea but I empathize.
@_date: 2012-12-21 21:10:13

Many of the individual local threads are getting 150-200 page views each, and other popular threads I have are getting in the 10's of thousands of pageviews, we are very high on Google and many people who find our site through Google often browse the rest of the site and by having a listing posted on our site greatly increases your chance of finding a buyer!  :D

price increases by $5.. people will come to gox and sell.  There won't be an unlimited amount, but the thread's title is skewed.  How would the kid's $2 mil worth the same as the fed's $10 tril?  For $10 trillion it's more than the value of all bitcoins combined, and no one could purchase them all, so the price would keep going up and up.  The online calculator assumes some 'slippage' in the price, and it's nice to dream sometimes about the value going up to $100 because $2 million went in, but the value of all bitcoins is like $142 million, so adding $2 million would mean it would only increase the price by a buck at the most, but if someone were to put a 'buy' through Gox to try and execute all the orders in one transaction, they would be wasting more than half of their money and the price would just bounce back like it always does, except it might float to a higher average.  
If the fed had $10 trillion they'd probably spend it on bombs.

ASICMINER can fight the price wars, too.
They have the capacity to produce tens of thousands of boards a week.  They made those 10,000 USB miners like it was nothing.  Just wait until they ship a million blades..  They produce them cheap enough, it's not like the COST is 50 BTC... The price is only 50 BTC because that's the market value right now.  It might be 25 BTC tomorrow.  Who knows.  But they can produce cheap ASICs like the best of them.
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:49:23
I'm sure friedcat could match that price if he was shipping raw chips, which they aren't doing.  
Agreed, ASICMiner and Avalon are two completely different beasts.  
Avalon has been mining on gear you guys owned, it's like paying for next years car now and the owner of the car company is going to give it to you when he's done driving it across the country and just before it needs an oil change, effectively giving you a USED product meanwhile you paid in advance for it's research and development.
ASICMiner only started getting into selling hardware as an afterthought of their ASIC "MINING" mega operation.  Some people were saying that ASICMINER is mining on their blades before they get them, that's not true.  ASICMiner selling ANY blades was a market test.  The blades are new and they ship immediately like a legitimate business.
I think Avalon should be shunned from the community, and when the next wave of products comes to light, I hope the community chooses to purchase through ASICMINER since they have proven to be the most transparent and legitimate companies I've ever heard of.  If they do price matching per hash, I hope users choose the company that didn't make a quick buck by mining on your units.

@_date: 2013-07-01 21:19:34
No, it actually is a fantasic way to advertise!  Try it out, it's more than  a URL shortener.  Others shorten URLs and share them, but when a user clicks a link somewhere, an ad will pop up, and that ad could be your site!
He should create an ad campaign for the URL 
Then 100's of thousands of users will end up on that page.  If 1% of them invest, consider it a success.  It's a good system to bring traffic to any web page.

I think the block limit is 1MB right now.  I have seen blocks bigger than 600kB before...  I think.  
So if the blk0000?.dat files have a limit, and I think they do since I just opened up my AppData folder and they are all 2GB...  I propose we make it so we can put bootstrap.dat files end-to-end.  Instead of releasing a 20GB torrent and then 3 months later releasing a 22GB torrent, there is too much wasted space and bandwidth involved with that.  We should be able to get, like, update blk0000?.dat files.  We can probably just put the .dat's in with the client but I have not had any success in doing that before.  
With each new version release, you could include the hash of the new update pack, instead of the hash of a complete new version.  I think it's more sustainable!
@_date: 2013-01-23 09:57:59

*"Actually that is an old maintenance message which i forgot to update, the servers were switched a few months back. The old mac minis are being fired up again and some processes are being moved over (Bitcoind, Email server etc) as well as upgrading the firmware on the firewall and installing the latest mysql cluster version.

sooo.. 
the 32 core, 96GB RAM system can't hack bitcoind so they are plugging in the macs?  huh?  I can understand taking load off a system, and maybe having bitcoind on a separate entity altogether is a great idea for securities' sake, but damn, wtf why don't they just put vmware on the big server and carve up mac mini's virtually when they need?
edit: I didn't read piuk's post directly under that one:

This is not the first time we've gotten this email actually.  I could post up other similarly worded but exact messages from Paypal regarding this issue.  I'm actually an employee at [WTCR]( and we've sold 1000's of Bitcoin miners outside of eBay and Paypal is really missing out on these sales.  We ship dozens of packages each day and PP is not getting a cent from them, although our customers are asking us every day if they can use their service to pay!  
I don't want to mention exactly how much money PP has of ours in hostage, but it's a lot.  We got positive feedback points from each device that was sold because we had the product in hand and shipped it immediately, the customers were getting the hardware but PP froze our account due to us selling bitcoin hardware.  That email I posted is one of many in a series of us trying to convince them to allow us to accept Paypal either on eBay or Paypal via our store, but they refuse.  We also tried to accept credit cards through eBay without Paypal.. have you ever tried to set that up?  They basically make everyone send in forms to a fax number and you never get a response ever.  You call in about it and they just say to fax them in...
If I could prove to you that this exact email came from Paypal I would.  I don't think I really need to but it's true.  We have tons of hardware sitting here that we want to put up on eBay (even our GPUs lying around) but they have completely blocked us.

I'm just saying.. if we peak at 50% of block tx max size right now, and if bitcoin scales 1000x in popularity, the bottleneck is going to be crazy!  I'm not sure we can get every man, woman, and child on earth on the bitcoin network with that limitation!  Users sending payments will have to be aware of the recommended fee sizes or their payments might get stuck.  It's scary.  I really hope that doesn't become a problem, if we are 10-50% of the way there now, and there are what, maybe 50,000-100,000 people passing transactions around?

Bad time to take a Bitcoin-loan.  Starting to sweat right there.  It's one thing to pay interest, it's a different story when your loan principal goes up by 25% in a matter of days, but I am not too concerned, I have the equivalent amount of Casascius in the vault so the amount of my physical coins goes up proportionally.. but yea, started to sweat and if bitcoins got high enough I might be tempted to crack those puppies open.

It may not be the hashrate that is going to directly bring the price up, but it's going to shake things up a bit.  and I mined a lot of coins in the past years with my GPUs, spending them as I go (no regrets, though), coins I won't be able to mine anymore since the ASICs are taking over the world.  My comments said what I was thinking but it may have read like the hashrate is going to directly drive the price up...  While I believe that is partly true, it's the "feeding frenzy" of the masses and the other factors that will lead into the inevitable price increases.  Sure I can buy coins like anyone else, and I do, but it's those coins minted with my hardware that won't be able to produce bitcoins as easily with the higher hashrates, y'knowwhatimsayin'?

Make sure it's an ATI Radeon 4xxx series or newer and is not an nVidia video card!  nVidia's are great for gaming but they are horrid for mining.
To get started quickly, download [GUIMiner from my site (or elsewhere)]( then sign up at a big pool like [deepbit]( or [eclipsemc]( and.. yea it's pretty easy to figure out, set the flags to **-v -w 128 -f 10** to get started then tweak it a bit. 
Just watch those temps!  Use [MSI Afterburner]( to keep an eye on things and/or overclock.  Try not to fry an expensive card by overclocking though, it's not worth it.

Litecoin's scrypt algo might also be it's Achilles heel.  The higher the difficulty = higher the security for 51% attackers, with scrypt we are limited currently to GPUs.

Ah. 
I was buying a van, and needed $500 so I cashed out 100 BTC.  Like, 100% of the coins I had, no other money available..  Time burned me on that one, there's no turning back to $5 coins now.  
This happened to me several times.  I bought a motherboard for 50 BTC before, bought a raid card for my server for 40 BTC.. Just, spent waaaaay too many BTC and now I feel honored to have 2 or 3 BTC in my wallet, when I could be so much wealthier if I just hung onto them over the years.  
Lesson learned: hedge yourself.  Make sure when you buy something, you're retaining a large part of your savings.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  I'm just glad I bought so many Litecoins because that's really starting to pay off over here.

That's why all I am all-in on Litecoin.  The difficulty is low and you can rack up tons of coins while they are cheap.  Once ASICMINER unleashes their next 200 TH, BFL ships 600 TH, Avalon ships some crazy amount of devices out there, the network is going to be in the petahashes.  There will be no room left for GPU miners.
Litecoin is ASIC-safe.  You can GPU mine it for years to come.

Excellent question.
Well if ASICMINER stops paying dividends, the passthrough shares will also be worthless so the passthrough/direct question is irrelevant in that case.
But ASICMINER has too much to lose.  
BitFountain founded ASICMINER, keeping &gt;50% of the company shares to themselves.  They hold 200,000 shares, with 200,000 being offered to the community.  Apparently there are more than 20,000 shares that were not sold, as they had already raised enough money and stopped selling shares, so there is a chunk of unsold shares still.  I think, I could be wrong, but the amount of publicly owned shares is around 165,000.  I think the rest are unsold, not receiving dividends, and just cash in the bank if they needed further funding.  
BitFountain's 200,000 shares are worth 500,000 BTC / $67,500,000.  Those shares would be worthless if they walked away, so I don't think they could justify losing THAT many millions especially when the shares are going to be worth far more in the next few months and years.  
They're also extremely organized, they have a panel of board members who do every move very carefully.  It's in their best interest to keep the money flowing. 
Also the hardware sales.  This is even more promising then their checkmate on the global hashrate.  They can move $10 million worth of hardware a week at their current infrastructure, they are able to pump out tens of thousands of devices instantly with their setup.  They would have a much harder time selling gear if they were a total scam, they aren't like BFL where they take preorders and don't deliver, they have the gear on hand and they ship immediately.  
It's a goldmine, IMHO.

You will need to switch to Litecoin once all the Bitcoin ASICs get online, GPU mining will be obsolete but Litecoin is ASIC-resistant.  
Download this cgminer which is set up for Litecoin.  the cgminer.conf file is your configuration, the cgminer.bat file starts the mining.  Play around with it, you'll need it eventually.

I wouldn't personally get the TAT shares.  Yeah, they are affordable, but try get the direct shares.  This way you don't need to log into any exchange to get your dividends, they are sent directly to your wallet. 
You can purchase ASICMINER-PT on btct.co and transfer your shares to the exchange owner (burnside) and get them as direct.  You can also purchase shares on bitcointalk auctions, be sure to escrow through John K.
I was talking about it with someone on reddit, you can see my ramblings [here]( to prevent me from saying it all over again.

I assume... what is the problem?  
I dont think I mentioned any problems.  I said timing belt changed @ 185k because XxionxX had said *"Yeah, 185k miles? No thanks."* and I was correcting him and sort of correcting myself because I read this 185k and thought it to be accurate until I noticed it different in the listing.  
Discussing a topic I don't know anything about... Well... I know a lot about cars, I've had I'd say 9 or 10 vehicles before, and I learned my lesson from buying cheap domestic cars.  I'm all about the Japanese cars now, with the exception of the '82 1-ton Chevy truck I recently bought (back when a truck was a truck), my daily driver is a '93 Honda and my summer car is also a '93 Honda, you might call me a mid-90's Japanese car fanboy.  
I'm not going to tell you I'm a mechanic and you should take my words to the bank, I'm just a dude on reddit commenting away, I didn't even debate anything like you say.  You freakin' hate it when people debate, what was I debating?  I was commenting.
My '93 Accord has over 300k "kilometers" on it, so like 186k miles, funny how the number is so similar to the context of our discussion, and it's a damn good car.  The only problem it has ever had is I borrowed it to a girl for a couple weeks and literally 24 hours after my insurance had lapsed, we got a freak flood and my car was at this extremely low point on a road and actually the tire was blocking the drain partly, and basically the whole car went under water for about 30 mins.  Past the seats, like the car is F**k'd.  It never ran the same again, I drove it for 2 years and I won't go into the details on the problems it faced, but eventually I got wise and bought a new ECU on eBay for $35.  Car ran like a dream again.  I took the old ECU apart and it was like rusted on both sides, it's a miracle the car didn't leave me stranded once.  So I've been driving the car for 5 years now, and I haven't had to change any other parts than that.  I just put fuel in and go.  To me, that's a well-made car.  (of course oil, filters, etc at regular intervals too)
So if by debate you mean the fact that I say this is a good truck?  If so, I think saying a Toyota truck is well-made goes without speaking.  Have you seen it on Top Gear how [Jeremy tries to kill a Toyota truck](  If the prophecies are true, it's not possible to kill a Toyota engine.  I wouldn't know, never owned one, but I have seen countless reports of million mile plus Toyotas.  I'm not sure about the ones that are made in 2000+, I am hell-bent on vehicles made in the 90's and older.  I think everything made today is plastic and garbage.  If you asked me what kind of vehicle is the most reliable of all vehicles, it would probably be a 90's Toyota truck.  That's just an opinion.  But I think many others will agree.  That said, any car can be a lemon, and a problem could have been noticed on this truck and maybe it will die next week so that's why he's selling it.  
If I was in California, I would buy this truck at the drop of a hat.  I think this thing is badass.  That said, I would sell the truck for BTC's too, since it's probably the better investment.

Oh I forgot to mention another fantastic way of buying shares, is to buy them direct from people.

When I read that these millionaires are investing and announcing that they have "millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin" like those 2 ex-FB guys you refer to, it's kind of funny if you look at how high the price has gone, they have practically paid 50x over the price they could have months ago.  It's like they are saying "well we're a bit late to the game but we're going all-in!" meanwhile they could have put down $10k at Christmas time.

He's offering USBs for 1.69 when they cost 2.00.  Wholesalers might get them for slightly less, but not at a price where they could offer them for 1.69...

It's not mentioned, but CanadianBitcoins.com is not an exchange.  It's a great place to buy Bitcoins, and it's what I use, but the price is not users trading, it's a posted buy and sell with a spread wide enough to cover them.  Only saying this because CanadianBitcoins.com, CaVirtex.com, and LibertyBit.com are the only three in Canada.  I heard there's one opening in Toronto but hell if I can find the URL.

Some people paid $30,000+, if you only bought $300 worth consider yourself lucky. 
And getting burnt for $300 isn't as bad as if you paid in Bitcoin in the first bit when there was no Paypal.  The (then) $150 Jala ended up costing $2000-4000 because of the coins increasing in value.  
If someone buys $100 or $10,000 or $100,000 worth of gear from a company and they are all treated equal, with lies, its like we all bought tons of Super Nintendos and we were lied to daily about its release and got **f%&amp;k yous** when we called to ask and it didn't get shipped to our door until Sega released the Dreamcast (and people get their SNES's one at a time, and paid more in shipping than it would have cost to buy a Sega Genesis), until its *years* later and only a small fraction of the SNES's have been released to the public that were paid for and then all of a sudden they start playing ads all over TV and every channel advertising the Nintendo Wii-U and it costs $5000 and you might get it in the next 2-5 years.  Yea.  Something like that.

So you are referring to this page?
**Note : Bitcoin-Qt initial sync can take a day to complete. You should make sure that you have enough bandwidth and storage for the full blockchain size.**
A day to complete?  On what internet connection?  I've had it take longer than a day.  Sometimes a week.  But whatever, they know right there that it takes awhile.
Yeah they link you to the page which shows a graph of the blockchain size over time.  Most users will understand that, but complete noobs won't.  But yeah it is pretty clear at that point.  I just think right when they are installing the bitcoin-qt program, some sort of mention of the ballooning size on their hard drive.

Something bad can happen.  Well, lots of bad things would happen, but one of them being the mining difficulty.
So let's say the world is at 80 TH/s right now.  nuclear bombs drop, people croak, power goes out, there is a lot of less interest in mining and more interest in survival.  Still a bunch of die hards out there, let's just say the power is reduced to 1% of what is was, assuming there is still an internet to connect everyone.  So I think that's like 0.8 TH/s.  Now the odds of finding a block gets 99% harder.  At 80 TH/s, we could find blocks on average in 10 minutes.  At 800 GH/s, it's more like I think 1000 minutes, 16 hours, to find 1 block.  Still possible, but it would take 2016 blocks for the difficulty to adjust back to reality, that's something like 33,600 hours, or 4 years.  In this time, full faith in bitcoin could plummet and we might never reach the next difficulty checkpoint, and if the hashrates drop low enough, impossible to find a block to transmit anything.  Value = Zero.  Make sure you have bottled water and canned beans just in case, not 100% sure if Bitcoin can outlast a war.  
This is especially interesting when the ASICs get out there.  The difficulty is going to get reallllllllly high.  It might make the problem extremely bad, except the ASICs are what would be needed to find the blocks to get the difficulty to adjust, so the problem might correct itself as long as the ASICs are evenly distributed all around the world. 
Just a theory.  Numbers are ballparks, just throwin' it out there.

Because all the passthroughs are just accounts that have direct shares through friedcat.  Like if there are 20,000 shares for sale on btct.co, then users would have transferred 20,000 shares from their direct friedcat accounts to the exchange to have them credited to trade. 
The passthroughs are very trustworthy, but getting them direct is golden.  You just instantly get the funds in your wallet, basically I suggest get a direct share so you can experience it.  It's a blockchain-level-dividend system, it's wonderful, having the shares on an exchange just feels like GLBSE all over again and I cringe at that fact, but it sounds like the exchanges trading AM stock are pretty legit, I still would rather deal with friedcat directly.  Plus you can always transfer them to an exchange to sell later.  
You are still investing in the mining, and reaping the dividends just the same as the PT.  The PT is just a way for users to purchase and trade shares on the exchange, they are functionally the same but I'd much sooner get a big wad of cash in the wallet than get an email from an exchange telling me to log in and then do a withdrawal to get my dividend.

The TAT dividend hasn't gone through yet.  Always a slight delay on passthrough shares.
Because ASICMINER is solo-mining now, the dividends paid to the direct-shareholders is delayed because unlike a normal bitcoin transaction where you can send after 1 confirm, solo-mined blocks require I think 180 confirmations, so it takes awhile for the direct shareholders to get theirs, I know mine hasn't confirmed yet...  But once they do confirm, then the passthrough owners will get their dividends and divide them up and give them to the passthrough shareholders!  :)
TAT pays out just like a PT would except minified, it's about a 95% dividend for a 1/100th share, I'm not sure about the PT's it's probably 98 or 99%, and direct is 100% :)

both CAVIRTEX and CanadianBitcoins are legit.  
be patient.  it is much harder to find bitcoins in other countries.  if it takes a couple hours for an email and a few days for a transfer, it's worth it.  I use both of those services steadily, I'm verified with CAVIRTEX and I have not verified through CanadianBitcoins but I have put large sums through there.  I wasn't aware that there is no CIBC cash dropoff anymore, that sucks :/

Well what's $200 buy these days, just over 2 BTC?  Well, what says the price doesn't climb that high?  Maybe I was a bit crazy with the time frame, maybe a few years.  If there is 120 billion in the Bitcoin world at that time, and (for the sake of not doing math right now) there are 12 million coins out there, that's $10,000 per coin.  
People might have called you crazy when Bitcoins were $5 and we were dreaming of $100.  Let's dream the $10,000 Bitcoin up.  There are trillions out there.  A $100,000 Bitcoin would mean a Bitcoin market cap of 1 trillion.  Plausible.

I was talking to the UnixStickers guys all day today, and they are going to be releasing some Bitcoin-themed stickers for us!  Right now a BAMT sticker is in the works, Aaron approved it, so that's going down for sure.  They also are going to make a generic Bitcoin badge, not sure exactly what the context of it will be (Bitcoin?  Bitcoind?  Armory?) but it doesn't seem like a huge problem for them to whip them up.  They just need approval from the company they are making a sticker for, and in Bitcoin's case there is no approval really necessary.  bitcoind would be a cool one, I mean if someone has a bitcoind server...  It's totally reason enough to put a badge on it..  Just careful someone doesn't see the sticker and just yoink the server lmao.  The context of his message regarding other Bitcoin stickers was *"..Bitcoin stickers they are also coming for sale!.."*  So it looks like maybe just a nice little Bitcoin badge perhaps?
We'll see what the future holds.  But I can't wait to get my hands on a BAMT badge!

Welcome to Bitcoin.  The reason it is so hard to obtain is because all other forms of payment are inadequate for the irreversibility of Bitcoin.  It's a lot easier to sell BTC than it is to buy.  Being in Moscow there must be tons of people involved with Bitcoin and buying/mining in various ways, but no storefronts yet and unfortunately no one on local bitcoins yet.  
What I can recommend is try think outside the box.  Maybe there is something you can buy in Russia money and sell for Bitcoin, on Bitmit or some other site.  It's a slow game but it's crazy enough to work.  There are other ways too, there must be a way that people in Russia can wire money to an exchange?  Gox is horrible to deal with, I couldn't imagine getting money in there.  Maybe what you need to do is find a trusted individual to do personal trades with to get your BTC.

Maybe make a deal with us then.  We sell computer gear for Bitcoin, and Bitcoin only.  When someone wants to wire us money, CC, paypal, etc..  We always convert it back to BTC as quickly as possible.
If you need computer components and pay in BTC, visit [WTCR]( * although if you live in the US, import fees could hurt your bottom line.. :(
But yeah, I could see the fees thing, but maybe you can find someone local to you from localbitcoins who you can make a deal with regularly to be your Bitcoin purchaser?  I know there are a lot of people out there who are having a hard time quickly purchasing Bitcoin, surely there is someone who will regularly do this conversion for you.
I can't think of any other reason to want to get back into cash so quickly.  I mean if you're driving to your local computer store and need to get cash to buy components, I could see a problem there.  We just have to hope that you can get your float to the point where you can bank the profits as BTC or USD and you always maintain enough flow so you don't need to do costly conversions like that.

Just send to one of those addresses through your bitcoin client and it will return you a payment as a result.  If you get a very small payment like 1 satoshi), then you lost.  If you got a big payment you win!  But play so responsibly because it can bite you in the ass sometimes.

@_date: 2013-06-02 15:11:19
They can put memory modules on boards and make Litecoin ASICs, technically.  Go straight into DDR5 with them.  GPUs already have DDR5, so I'm not sure if they would be super powerful but the processing could be done in an ASIC which would bottleneck the RAM, but I bet in the next few years something will be done to get scrypt done crazily fast. :)

burning it to a CD was too expensive?  
@_date: 2013-05-30 21:29:01
Yeah that's the golden part of it all.  There are no accounts per-say...  You just get Bitcoins delivered to your address every week.  You don't have anywhere to apply or login to, just a dividend coming.  Let's say you wanted to get some shares.  Go to btct.co and buy some ASICMINER-PT.  You then go through the process of transferring them to direct, you let burnside know what bitcoin address + email for the shares to be transferred to, burnside messages friedcat and then friedcat gives you the shares.  The shares are attributed to your email, although I have no idea what that is for other than another form of verification down the road perhaps.  The main part is the bitcoin address.  
So having 1 share is the same as 5000 shares on direct.  You just get that amount of shares.  Let's say Bob wanted to transfer 5 shares to Alice, Bob would message friedcat and say "transfer 5 shares from X address to Y address."  Boom, it's done in a day or so.  Then every wednesday you'll see a 1-satoshi-per-share payment and then the big one.  So you don't have to ask anyone how many shares you have, you always see the 1-satoshi payment and that's the number of shares you have.  Getting shares as direct are so awesome.  Like for example yesterday the ASICMINER-PT dividend on btct.co was like 12 hours late because of a software glitch on the website caused the TAT shares to receive a double dividend and they needed to fix the glitch.  With direct shares you don't have to worry about a website going down, website under DDOS, admin being late on payment, government intervention, or the webserver getting hacked, I can think of so many things that can go wrong.  But direct shares..  You just have to sit there and throw a party every wednesday and crack open champagne.  Buy lots and lots of shares.  Go crazy on these ones, the future looks bright.
It's such a beautiful system.

Well if BFL has pre-ordered a zillion units, when those units arrive, the difficulty will be so high that by the time your unit arrives the network will be crazy and you might not even profit.  That said, get a $150-er and see what happens. 
Your best bet is to buy bitcoins and hold them.

It has it's advantages as a buyer as well.  I work at a bitcoin-accepting store, and although we send an email confirming the user that they have paid and the order will ship after only 3 confirmations, sometimes when a user places an order and we see on the blockchain that they have sent the payment 5 minutes ago, we start to package the item up and sometimes they get a tracking number before the payment is even cleared our 3 confirmation rule.  It accelerates the confidence as a seller, so as a buyer when you pay with it (at legitimate places), there is no concern to prevent us from shipping your order the moment the payment appears on the blockchain.

Don't think about the profitability in BTC per day if you are pre-ordering a BFL product.  You would always be better off just buying Bitcoins and holding them but some people want hardware and so CLEARLY there are so many pre-orders out there that no one stands a chance at profiting if they order now.  
Unless BTC price SKYROCKETS to another dimension, then these things are going to become hot commodities.  But in that case you would have been better off just buying Bitcoins.  
But the price of a Jalapeno is relatively cheap considering the prices of other ASIC gear.  You can't really go wrong if you can afford to toss $280 away on a neato "maybe" good idea product.  Don't bet the farm on this.  
Look at the difficulty right now:
The red line is difficulty adjustments.  
See how the difficulty is about to raise by 45% in the next few days?
Calculate your profits when you lose half every 10 days.  
I think the better investment is buy a single direct ASICMINER share.  
@_date: 2013-03-31 07:22:41

@_date: 2013-04-11 22:14:05
they have sold, perhaps, $10's of millions of dollars worth of pre-orders.  by the time you get yours, profitability will be nil.  difficulty will correct everything.

This is the  concern with these, clearly.  My goal with these is to eventually get some sort of code that can be run on a raspberry pi and hooked directly up to the printer so as soon as someone orders one on the site, the card comes out of the printer and it is ready to ship, private key never recorded.  Until then, you will just have to trust that the private keys are not saved.  I want to be 100% open with the operations of this, and I feel that if I were to ever do anything fishy, it would ruin my reputation forever, and thus I back it up with the full knowing that you will shun me from the community forever.  I am the person behind BitcoinTrading.com, CoinURL.com, part owner of OperationFabulous.com, and lots of other sites.. and more to come!  I wouldn't just suddenly go crooked on you guys.  Like I said, perhaps soon enough we will have a trustless 2-factor solution ready so you would hold the other part of the private key, and only the other factor goes on the card.  This would be very simple to implement.  We are just launching Coinverters officially today, with many new adjustments and tweaks along the way, as well many other services are coming soon.

notroll.in is alright too, coinotron.com is good as well..
my suggestion?  
sign up for EVERY pool.  use cgminer.  "load-balance" so each pool gets an even share, this way if a pool goes offline, you don't skip a beat.  set your auto-payouts low enough that if a pool vanishes you dont end up losing big but high enough that you dont have a wallet full of microtransactions (this can cause to higher fees when you go to spend them later).
I run bitcointrading.com, and I have some fantastic guides for you:
I have scripts there that you just fire up a standard bamt 0.5c, execute the script, and the whole system is ready and configured for Litecoin, plus many easy additions.

The green/purple/blue lines are estimates on the hashrate based on how many blocks are being solved by miners in the time frame.
The red line is the difficulty.  Ever 2016 blocks the protocol adjusts the difficulty to make it harder to solve blocks, to try maintain 10 minutes per block.  So every time the difficulty goes up by 10%, a miner gets 10% less Bitcoins.  
Right now looks like a 25% difficulty is in order.  I'd even go as far as saying it's going up by over 45%.  
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:43:46
You need to get in on the action.
Okay, basically the actual "direct shares" are just in a database with ASICMINER.  You don't have a website to log into or anything like that, the only indication that you have shares is the massive pile of bitcoin that shows up in your wallet every wednesday.  They send out 2 payments at the same time, 1 of them is a 1-satoshi payment (like 0.00000001 per share) as a "test" but actually it works out great for determining how many shares you have.  Then the full payment comes at the same time.  
The passthrough shares are basically the best way to get in easily.  You can buy [ASICMINER-PT on btct.co]( and 1 ASICMINER-PT share = 1 regular ASICMINER share.  Your weekly dividends will go into your account on btct.co, but I would recommend taking advantage of their very generous transfer system.  You can transfer 1 ASICMINER-PT share into 1 direct ASICMINER share for FREE!  You can transfer once per month for free (even 1 share), 0.25 BTC per transfer if you do &gt;1 per month, and if you have &gt;50 shares per transfer it's always free.
You can also buy [G.ASICMINER-PT on Bitfunder.com]( another great exchange and it works much the same, except you need 250 shares to withdrawal...  Big players only basically.  
If you buy the TAT shares, they give you a bit extra dividend with some spare change you have lying around, but you can only transfer a TAT share to a direct share if you save up 100 of them, sell them and they should be enough to purchase an ASICMINER-PT share.  
The TAT shares are also on [Havelock](

Yeah but ASICMINER was at like 10 TH/s not too long ago.  Now they're mining at like 30 TH/s.  They have the capacity to keep increasing their hashrate over time, already talking about gen 2 chips down to 55nm, plus you get a % of all hardware sales.
When their hashrate increases and the share price doesn't increase, I consider it a great deal.

Did they send test units of the BFL Single (FPGA) units before shipping to customers who paid?  Did Avalon ship to reviewers and magazine companies before they shipped?
"Standard practice" is not universal and I think 10-month-late Bitcoin ASICs are not "standard."
They know that if you order today, there will be like 1000 TH/s added to the network before you get yours, making any purchase today useless...  Unless the price of BTC adjusts accordingly...  Which would mean that buying Bitcoins today is a better investment than a BFL unit. 
If they ship to reviewers, they get more sales, end of story.  This is a last effort to get more sales under their belt before they ship, to leave more people disappointed.

Wow, they made how much money and didn't pay for like a 5 year renewal!?  Shocking.

I think it's also fantastic and the best mining calculator to date. 
But it shows me the opposite.
The difficulty will get so hard that you're better off selling all your gear to buy the coins.

Instead of getting paid per-share for their mining efforts and distributing those to us, they are "soloing" the network to get full blocks and they will distribute those to us.  I expect the payouts to be the same, plus the 3% in fees is saved.  But the payout variance will now be there, if we had a really low hashrate and bad luck it could mess with the payouts but ASICMINER has a groin-grabbingly-high hashrate so that won't be an issue.  As of this writing, the ASICMINER account on btcguild is sitting at 1,942 blocks solved for the pool, 2nd place is only at 246.  Now those numbers are just for stats, as we don't get the whole block, all we got were shares, proportionate to the hashrate, and same with all the members of the pool.. except it was primarily ASICMINER who was solving the blocks.  Now that they are going solo, they won't have to share with the other users in the pool.  We will get significantly more coin at the end of the day.  If on BTCGUILD, if we hit 20 blocks in a row in 1 hour, we would get the same payout if they didn't hit a single block.  See the problem?  Now we might have GREAT weeks!!!!
I wonder how we can graph their hashrate now?
