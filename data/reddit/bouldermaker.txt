Why did you quote "valueless"? I don't believe that is a quote... It's not that he believes that gold is without value, it's that he believes the long term expected return on gold is 0% because it is not a value producing asset. So, gold is not "valueless", it's simply not an investment vehicle at all, nor is cash.

Does it offer cash flow? Are there coupons? What about dividends? What is the transaction fee? Is it cheaper than existing means of transferring money? Is it any better as a store of value? How much resources does it require? Where is the intrinsic value? Do tell!!!

You're conflating "betting against innovation" with betting that Bitcoin is a bubble.

Don't you think most people "are only investing in [Bitcoin] where [their] entire goal is to flip for a profit quickly.." ?

Notice how any article that rationally argues against the merits of bitcoin is immediately and violently down voted and mocked? Echo chamber much?

Yeah, but no one is claiming that FIAT is a value producing asset...

“It is our guess that the crypto-bubble will continue until the Fed and other central banks remove too much liquidity from the economy, the availability of ‘greater fools’ decreases, and the bubble deflates,” Bernstein writes. “One would have thought that investors would have learned their lesson from the deflation of the technology and housing bubbles, but that doesn’t appear to be the case.”
All these people screaming "HODL" on social media and reddit about Bitcoin are part of the problem. It is the same mentality that created the tech wreck and the housing pop.

Dude, I think you should read this. I clicked on your profile, and the first thing I see is that you have two kids and suffer from Bitcoin fear of missing out. I think you could use some rationality, and an understanding of where value comes from...
