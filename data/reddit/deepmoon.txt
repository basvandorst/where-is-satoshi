The section about mining pools gives it away, it's a lie. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:30:35
OP, I actually think this is the answer you're looking for.   After bitcoin, you start to feel unsafe with monopoly money. You keep buying because your subconscious knows what's real.

Always expect James to nail it, but he gets better and better.

Opinion: This is a failure.. you know why?
I CAN'T pay with bitcoin to support you and also get a file to download. 3 sites... no luck...I'm physically sick of this shit. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:18:29
But it does have a huge list of fiat to choose from.. This is all so silly :/
@_date: 2015-07-13 05:47:50
Why doesn't it say BTC ?

Many ways to tumble.. You can do the shapeshift thing or use an exchange to create an "air gap" by switching block chains and back...   If you aren't comfy with this you can tumble manually by tossing the btc around to different wallets you control.  For instance, an HD wallet like mycelium (which is awesome btw)              Use your imagination in cryptoland :)
