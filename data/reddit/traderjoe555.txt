I hope those manipulative buy whales get rekt
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:19:58
BS pulled by Coinbase is why cryptocurrency will never taken seriously by investors. It seems like it is run by bunch of amateurs compare to Wall Street exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:47:21
I sold all my Bcash  a pop. Free money and bought more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:23
I'm new to this sub and didn't know the backstory. Is this why people are praising Andrea and donating to him because he was defending BTC against attacks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:45:15
Thanks. I understand it is open source but many open source project also have trademarks to prevent abuse. I mean what stops me from selling a "fake" bitcoin and claiming this is the bitcoin and using bitcoin logo???
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:12:15
I hate Roger Ver with passion.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:24:36
I agree. Little guys are getting raped by big whales with SEC. Imagine the level of corruption w/o the SEC... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:25:28
I hope Bcash get demolished. I hate how they rekt the BTC market in the past few days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:40:41
where do you see the sell wall?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:46:35
What Roger and his cohorts are doing are selling BTC to fund the pump of bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:00:22
I seriously hope bitcoin can recover from this nightmare...
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:50:15
As soon as we see some small recovery, we dip again... Repeating this pattern over and over...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:10:28
bcash is worthless
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:56:18
I bought in at 19.8k . Rest in peace...
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:18
Looks like the buy orders are disappearing. It was 2500 and now 1300
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:08:23
thanks. I'm at Bitmex with margin so I will lose everything if the price drops below $11k... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:08:22
Even if Coinbase says "selling is not supported in my country." ??
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:32:36
RIP everyone
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:43
Does anyone know what caused the huge BTC backlog in the past few days? Is this Roger Ver's gang's strategy to prevent people from transferring BTC so they can't buy BTC even if they want to because the funds are locked up?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:20
the support is so weak. I've seen so many walls disappear or get overwhelm 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:21:00
Is bitcoin cash going to crash today???
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:01:02
Guys, after seeing so many reds, seeing $13k makes me happy. I hope it will just stop dropping and settles down before recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:47
Market manipulation the finest. GDAX cancelled all of yesterday's orders of BTC/Bcash to give pumper time to regroup.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:10
bro im doing far worse than you... i have similar liq. hope we can survive...
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:43:10
What caused this backhog? Is it the attack??
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:59:09
but we are seeing continued bigger dip with each small recovery so the downward trajectory is stronger than the dip buyer...
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:21:56
When will this fall done? Everything was fine until two days ago when this Bcash crap happened.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:13
These kind of corrections will just scare off any further investors and bad for bitcoin's future health.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:24:59
Thanks. What's stopping people from keep doing hardfork and replicating all these new coins?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:24:42
It is hard to have faith in a system when rules changes on the fly. Coinbase initially announced Bcash trading on Jan 2018 and suddenly released it yesterday. That's just amateur move.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:48:38
when will this fall end? it has been falling and falling for the past few days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:19:00
I hope BTC goes to 100k to compensate for all the pain and suffering of the past few days caused by Btrash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:37:14
When will that be???
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:32:01
you're doing better than me. my liq is 11.3. Let's pray Santa will calm the market.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:43:36
I bought pretty high so....
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:05
when will this stop?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:36:07
it is still tanking. no bound in sight...
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:04
Oh man it is tanking hard. I'm getting nervous...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:08:12
Bcash brings down the value of BTC but for them, it is probably a wash...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:01:00
That would be epic. I actually trust the Winklevoss twins in  the bitcoin industry more than anyone else. I remember them calling BTC at $20k few years ago and thought they were high...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:24
I hate these BCH pumper that caused this crash. Now everybody loses.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:51:58
I would buy if I didn't long all my money at 19.8k. foolish me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:23:07
im shitting my pants for the past 3-4 days now
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:22:47
yeah i'm fairly well versed in tech and was confused by the bcash fork.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:59:59
Another crash. Who is selling? This screams market manipulation... It is sad that there altcoin are polluting the bitcoin market. All these stupid altcoins just further confuses regular people and slow adoption of cryptocurrency.
