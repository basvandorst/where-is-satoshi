This bot does not use any of those strategies. What you said is true, but neural networks are also used for other "normal" trading strategies.
High-frequency strategies are very unfair, to say the least....

I do have a small amount of money invested using this bot. This bot was a project I made initially just for fun while attempting college and I developed this app because I want to show my baby to the community...

I don't know what to say to you...  It's not a scam. This bot was a project I made as I was finishing my degree. I wanted to share it so I made the app... what's wrong with that? Yes, I have a small amout of money invested with this bot, but it's not making me rich from night to day.
The app has +10 users because I released it a couple days ago and is still in beta. 
You shouldn't be claiming it's a scam just because. How could it be a scam? It's an android app that lets you check a chart with some information...
I might have to delete my post because of this...

Sorry it's a necessity  :/  I have to pay for the servers. So I had to limit the number of times each user can use the forecast to once every 12 hours. The "premium version" is intended to allow the users to use the forecast as much as they want if they are willing to help support this project.

Sorry but I can't release my app's source code. Otherwise, any one could reupload it as their own.

You shouldn't be calling and reporting someone as a scammer just because... You literally ruined any attention I could have had to my app

Yes, there isn't such thing as a perfect forecast. This algorithm finds patters that indicate (to some degree) the tendency of the market. It's also possible to check the "predictions" the bot made in the past, so one can see how the bot react.

I don't know what to say to you. Artificial Neural Networks are actually used quite a lot in automatic trading bots for the stock market. This app shows the "predictions" of a trading bot.
