I dont understand everyones issue with this site. People claim to have been ‘tricked’ into buying bcash, but the site clearly separates the two. Iv never had issues buying bitcoin, dont really care for the fees but it works. Takes like 10-15 minutes max and its accepted by my bank

If bitcoin core was anything other than bitcoin it wouldn’t be received by my btc wallet. The only argument you guys give is that bitcoin.com should only be about bitcoin. You call the site a scam because they promote bcash. Y’all some ignorant mf’s

Every crypto is an ‘upgrade’ to bitcoin. That’s the whole point of altcoins to begin with, they all claim to be better than bitcoin. Who gives a fuck what they call bitcoin, if I buy it and it shows up in my wallet then it works. Not a scam. You can’t possibly believe that bitcoin cash is bitcoin. You can’t buy bcash and put it in a bitcoin wallet, it won’t work. It’s not a scam to promote another crypto, you guys are dumb af and just regurgitate every bit of bullshit you hear.
Theyr payment gateway is through symplex, which is the same that Abra uses. Iv been buying with them for over a year now and Iv never had an issue or felt mislead.

I get that them calling in bitcoin core gets everyones panties in a bunch, but if I purchase ‘bitcoin core’ and it is received to my bitcoin address, it is therefore bitcoin. Is it not?

And how does a software implementation trick you into buying bcash? That’s what confuses me. You call it a scam because they lied and forced you to buy bitcoin cash? That’s not physically possible. Go on the website, right now. See where it says bitcoin cash, then bitcoin core? All it says is it “recommends” bitcoin cash and all you idiots get your panties in a bunch, throw a hissy fit and claim it’s a scam

I get that for first time buyers it can be confusing but anyone who doesn’t understand what the difference between the two shouldn’t be buying bitcoin just yet in the first place. As far as how easy it is for me to actually buy bitcoin, this is one of the most reliable ways I have found. It doesn’t take but 10 minutes and I have my bitcoin. Most other payment gateways more time. As long as I get what I’m looking for I’m happy. If it were a scam I wouldn’t get any of my money. It’s just a marketing strategy.

Then why does it matter? I don’t care about bcash. I don’t buy it at all or believe it has a future but if I still receive my bitcoin idgaf, it’s fucking bitcoin
