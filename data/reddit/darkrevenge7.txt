How does one make a paper wallet? As I saw it briefly (I am at work D: ) I should make a wallet, store the BT, Encrypt with a strong password, print the key with QR code and save it at a safe place.

Well I am unsure yet about what client and so to use. I am going to research all of that later this week. I am now wondering if someone has tips or advice for me before I start the researching the options and before I start buying BT.

I want to get started into bitcoin and invent some of my savings to buy either 0.25 BT or 0.2 BT and buy some BT every time I receive my paycheck. I have my adress to buy (Bitonic.nl)
Any tips for me?

I have been thinking about making the wallet, deposit the BT then transport the wallet.dat file onto a small USB and keep it in a safe place. 
What are the benefits of paper wallets?

I am going to end up with maybe 1BT at most. 
Are gmail and dropbox a bit insecure? It means I have to crack up the security of those accounts up. Since I use those daily getting all crazy with security would be too time consuming. 
Option here is getting a new email account and dropbox and save the password somewhere. I am unsure about the security but I feel safer with paper wallets and/or USB flash drives. 
Could be my noobishness in BT security that I think like this. I do appreciate all of the help!
