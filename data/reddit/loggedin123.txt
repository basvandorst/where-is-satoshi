Actually, you can. Anything from an app on your phone, to a debit card that uses your bitcoin.

Well, every news source is biased. Coindesk is worse than others and is **very** biased.
I think the easiest way to show you is for you to read this article. A few months old now but still very true. If you still don't agree with me after reading this I'm happy to talk more of course, but I think this makes it all pretty plain. You'll start to notice it afterwards now too; CoinDesk *very* subtly supports Barry's own ventures and shits on those he is against. For example, they FUDs Ethereum constantly with misleading articles....yet at the same time when something truly valuable is being built with Ethereum, they just refer to it in the articles as "blockchain technology" without ever mentioning that Ethereum is the platform. If you read the whole article I just linked, then I don't see how anyone can't agree about Coindesk. 
paging just so he sees the continuation of this discussion too.

Just saying...look up Ethereum "staking" or "proof of stake"

Hey, just thought I would throw out my two cents that CoinDesk is a biased and self-serving shady company run by a shady person. At the very least, browse CrypoCoinNews or CryptoTelegraph as well so you aren't engulfed in that sketchy site.

He is. And he's really into ETH as well, bought it and tweeted about it pre-2016.

Some people actually are paid in bitcoin. The tax division has ruled that any exchange of btc for usd is taxable the same as a stock sale
