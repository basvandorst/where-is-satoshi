Ah, so you want it to be underground. I'm sure the price will stay that way when your wish will come true. By the way I don't know which source you're quoting but p2p is not more popular than ever. [

I hope you're right and I'm wrong for the very simple fact. I've got 50% of my own savings in bitcoins.

But all your sources are just your feelings. I respect them. Since we exchange feelings rather than data mine is that bitcoin will not succeed if it becomes an underground currency.

Hope you didn't take the title personally? Or did you.. twitting from mama's basement?

P2P file-sharing is a bad comparison. P2P is being marginalized and censored at a staggering rate. If that ever happens to bitcoin its relative value to dollar will drop to zero basically killing this whole gig.

You obviously don't understand how things work. Government (read banks) have got the power to outlaw bitcoins in a blink of an eye. They do it, then they will send out a press release with money laundering, drugs, etc. keywords  and that's it. No legal business will ever accept bitcoins. At that moment bitcoin is dead or at most back to 10,000 bitcoins pizza price.

I think user mariodraghi  got it right - "I disagree with the comparison to drugs. Bitcoins don't appeal to a basic human desire like drugs do." .. or speeding.
Look what happened to e-Gold, it's the reverse what you've just said: "Despite the legal action, e-gold remains in business, though no longer accepting any new accounts. However, its gold bullion reserves have dropped from 112,188 oz in April 2007 to 84,856 oz (from 3,491.0 kg to 2,461.2 kg) by June 2007."

Denial is a first step to overcome my friend.
Prohibition on drugs works amazingly well. Only dissidents don't abide by the rules, majority of population do. If the government labels cheese illegal tomorrow the entire cheese industry will collapse. Same with bitcoin.
