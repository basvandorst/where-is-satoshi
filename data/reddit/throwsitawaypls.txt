Not hardcoding a limit doesn't mean there won't be a limit.  Storage, processing, and bandwidth are all factors that create a limit for us.  Not hardcoding the limit allows it to expand naturally.  If someone tried to create an insanely large block, it would get orphaned because it would take too long to propagate across the network.

Bitcoin is built on free market principles.  Yet you want to stick with a random block size limit instead of letting the market decide?  What if you're dooming bitcoin with this decision?
I personally don't have any issues with a smaller group of miners.  Miners are nothing without users and exchanges.  Plenty of incentives to keep them in check.

Artificially high fees are in demand because cryptocurrencies are too young to have a lot of strong competitors.  But that won't last forever.

Fees are a solution.  Artificially high fees are a flaw.

They need to work on their lending.  Lots of money sitting there losing to inflation.

This address was sent to at 4a EST.  So probably not someone in the US.  The change from the previous transaction contain a lot of binary values.

In addition to the double spend risk, most merchants are still converting to Fiat.  The longer it takes to confirm, the longer it takes to convert.  If the price changes too much while waiting, then the merchant might take a loss or risk losing the sale completely due to having to ask for more or issuing a refund.
Until the merchants buy their merchandise with btc or accept lightning, we'll continue to see this problem.  Btc still has a long way to go.

House value is irrelevant since it is the same whether you're paid off or mortgaged.
If I paid for my house in full for $100 and sell for $115 the next year, I made $15.
If I mortgaged a house for $100, paid $4 in interest, made $10 in interest from investments, and sold for $115, I made $21.

I'm all for blockchain solutions but I don't really see one for healthcare.  Even this article was pretty vague on the details.  
The biggest problem with healthcare for me is price discovery.  I don't see a blockchain solution for that.

Slight unrelated but let's say I have address1 with 12BTC in it. 
 If I created a transaction to send 6BTC to address2 and the remaining 6BTC sent back to address1 (as change).  Could you replay that transaction to the network and have it send 6BTC in address1 to address2 again?  
If not because address1 only has 6BTC instead of 12BTC, could you do it if you sent address1 another 6BTC?

Double spending is about spending more than you have.  My example is about spending more than intended - not more than you have.
Edit: I think I know why.  A transaction is a list of previous transaction(s) to an address(es) you have the private key(s) to.  Those previous transaction(s) will now be spent so I can't replay the transaction - even though the balance of the address still has funds.

It's needed because they want to make sure you weren't loaned the money.  The bank thinks the loan is less risky if you have some of your hard earned money in the house.

The mortgage company just wants to know that you weren't loaned the down payment - especially if it's over 20% since your avoiding mortgage insurance.  The down payment is a seen as having skin in the game so the loan feels less risky to the bank.

Depends how long you've owned them.  If over a year, you probably only pay 15-20% capital gains tax (depending on your income).  Otherwise expect to pay whatever bracket you're currently in for income tax.

It's more of a "had them on blockchain.info this long... seems risky to mess with a good thing"

Why is this concept so hard to grasp?!?!  Thank you for trying to educate these people even if they never believe us.

Anyone else get this email that has never used Authy?  Did coinbase give out a bunch of emails?  Or did Authy use the compromised mtgox user list?

My best guess is when Congress passed this tax code, it was meant to incentivize long term investments instead of short term ones.  Either to stabilize the markets and/or to offer tax relief for funds being saved for retirement.
