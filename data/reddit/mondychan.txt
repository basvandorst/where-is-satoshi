Its most likely your bank forcing you the high SEPA fee, my bank charges €1 for SEPA payment (and that's free account, no monthly fee, if I paid €5 monthly fee I would get unlimited SEPA in and out for free), so you should maybe consider changing your bank, or making a separate bank account for crypto only - but sry I'm not familiar with UK banks, cannot recommend any specific crypto friendly
As for reliable and respectable exchange I would recommend Bitstamp
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:19
aha, well, bitcoin doesnt act as a stock, it acts more like a currency, each bitcoin consists of smaller units (called Satoshi) same as Dollar consists of cents
its possible to almost indefinitely split (8 decimal places)  , its basic function from the very begining
"Currently the smallest unit of the bitcoin currency recorded on the block chain is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC)"

taken from their FAQ: Price is calculated by taking the volume weighted average of all prices reported at each market. 
for example korean exchanges trading BTC at $21 303,10 equivalent in KRW , bumps the overall price up
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:31:34
well, thats very easy, build a smart conrtract on top of the package tracking (for example), lock the funds in place and when the package reaches hands of the receiver the sellers get them
open you mind, where was bitcoin 5 years ago and where is it today (as a technology), i wouldnt be so fast with "LN or BTC can never do" statements

you my friend are asking question about ~how to time the engine~ but you yet dont even understand what engine is for, educate yourself on the basics and then slowly move on to next tier
I'll try to simply answer your questions, but given the way they were asked I'm not really sure you will understand. 
All transactions have to be verified by miners and included in a block, each transaction must pay a fee to the miner for it to get processed, so the reward comes from the fees (plus in the early stages of Bitcoin, each block carries reward of its own to make sure miners get rewarded even if the network hasn't been really utilized by users and given enough fee),  as for the who gets the reward and who decides what one's it, a miner that finds a block and includes transaction into it gets the block, it's first come first serve rule, that's how it's decided 
If you have not understood any of the mentioned processes (miners, block...) then you still have a lot of study ahead of you and I won't go into much detail here, maybe right side panel would be a good start for you 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:05:40
seems like regular transaction where defined portion of the input was sent to a recipient (in your case the Coinbase) and the rest of the input was sent to change address (ie. should be in your Trezor)
btw. move your funds in trezor to segwit type wallet, you will save on the fees and help the network too
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:33:09
you can do it, sending from legacy to segwit (and vice versa) is totaly supported, right now fees of 300+sat/b are confirmed in next block
as to for the fee, i would wait till sunday (there is usually less traffic on weekends and fees tend to go down) and then decide the fee rate after checking  for current state of fees
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:33:44
current builds are locked to tesnet, if there was even open alpha for mainnet, i would gladly test
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:59

use "Real" wallet next time (bread wallet is praised by many), one that lets you choose your fees
also withdrawal from coinbase is possible for free when you transfer fees to gdax, so buy there if you must, transfer to gdax, withdraw to personal wallet for free and then choose the fee as you wish
good luck next time

mate, you should use a coma -&gt; , &lt;- for separating large numbers and a decimal mark (dot) -&gt; . &lt;- as decimal mark

The receiving side of the transaction would have to TRUST the sender (in this case the former key owner) to destroy his copy of the key, otherwise it wouldn't be 100% safe to keep the coins there,as they could be stolen at any point in future, dunno how good friends they actually are,but I personally wouldn't believe any 3rd party to hold keys to my "gold vault"...

The actual creation,testing and "approval" of new code takes lot of time (security,consensus rules of network...),but the improvements that actually get deployed to the network are usually long lasting and should last for long enough, till the next leap happens
As new ways to use the technology,code and such are found, we utilize them to help move forward. With Bitcoin it's kinda slow,steady and most of all SAFE development,but compared to other global fenomena in human history,we are moving at light speed.
Just think how long it took to fabricate and test rockets,computers,navigation Technics and countless other tasks to get man on the Moon...but landing on it was a single awesome moment in human history,
that's what we aim for...developing one step at the time till "global domination"

what folded did u clear? if you cleared C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin\ 
then STOP using the HDD RIGHT NOW! pull it out of the pc and dont power it back, later you can try to recover the files, some (incl. me can be of a help)
if you just cleared the install directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\), wait for the blockchain to sync and all will be good

Depends on the resources, but it's actually more expansive to mine Bitcoin instead of simply buying it at market price
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:09
hehe, ok, thx for the tip :D 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:26:16
its ~~awesomeminer~~ nicehash, used for mining alts and getting payouts in btc
but dont get pumped, you wont make much on a regular pc, you need specialized hw to be efficient, you will just put stress on your hardware and loose fortune in electricity costs along the way
edit: its the new nicehash client, trought its awesomeminer, its some time i stop using it, sry :)

@_date: 2017-11-12 15:56:57
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:17:38
We (more precisely developers smarter than 95% of community) will have to make modifications to the code to make transfers faster and fees more effective (hopefully ending in less fees for users), but we are in early stages of development and there are lot of people making transactions right now,so we are a big stuck with high fees right now, but it will be fixed in near future and scale up for wide usage in future

i can only agree with you, i take it as savings myself :)
what matters is percents only, doesnt matter how much you put in 100 or 10000 , the percentage is the same for you
dont expect to make milions while investing hundreds, but can still make some nice gains and save money in something interesting and fun
also you can always change your strategy, there is nothing bad starting with smaller sums and work your way up over time ...

i have good experience with blockchain.info, helf funds of me and many of my friends safely for many years...some still keep their funds there, but most migrated to hardware wallets by now 
buying btc there is also breeze, reasonable market prices and credit card fees (my gf buys there ocasinaly), just takes time for the first time buyer to get verified there, they validate some info from credit company on the first purchase, next purchases are instant

i have lot of experience with mining right using gpus and believe me, those mining calculations are nothing close to stress test for real life usage, 
cards finely tuned for mining operations are very unstable in gaming and othervise
but can nicely test psu, cooling and mobo stability (to some extend)
you will surely wake up to +$1 in btc, but also with -$5 in electricity ... figure :)
but ofc, for fun, why not :) i totaly encourage trying it, maybe you will build real mining rig one day ...

the sender used a VERY low payment fee, i wouldnt worry about it just yet, its just stuck in the network ... maybe over weekend it will get comfirmed , previous track of coins show no worring behaviour, so it should be fine, just need the miners to work their way trought mempool all the way to 5-10 sat/b fee levels

i dont know what we are talking here about really, OP asked a question "Best way to store large amount of bitcoins?" and you proposed memorizing the private key, which i dont find very secure, so i warned him and everyone else of such behaviour ... 
saving your priv keys to an encrypted storage and forgettin the encryption key is whole lot of different story, i dont really get what that have to do with "Best way to store large amount of bitcoins"

just my two cents, but based on this  Intel wont give a f*ck about manufacturing ASICs for bitcoin mining, they sell so many Xeons they can buy bitmain's company in a day if they want to (dont take my word for it) :D 
if anyone, we need a young and bold company to start the development &amp; manufacture, established silicon manufacturers have much more lucrative and stable business goin on already, they dont have to gamble...
