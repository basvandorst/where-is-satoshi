Yes. Unless you're trading on a DEX.

Is it for longtime holding fiat? I'd go for Swedish krona(they are at a low from sub-zero interest rates) will probably do a 30 - 40% increase to the dollar in 5 - 7 years. I guess you could go for the new Bolivar as well if you think Venezuela ever gonna get back on their feet(though that is like shooting yourself in the foot to get insurance money). Fiat trading is a pretty stupid game, unless you have 10s of millions to do it with, just stick to BTC, ETH and DAI and you'll make a nice profit.

Don't forget the 1800 bitcoin mined each day that has to be gobbled up by the market. Meaning today at least 18,000,000$ has to go in the btc market or it drops. Not in trade volume, but newly minted shiny dollars.

Well in the satoshi whitepaper it says a 51% attack is a fundamental part of any proper blockchain as it icitevices any network to grow so as not to get susceptible of one. The possibility of a 51% attack is part of the design of the original blockchain and as a hack is to use flaws in designs to carry out an attack a 51% attack can't be labeled a hack.

If you take inflation and the rise in purchasing power in consideration milk is actually about 70% cheaper today than it was 30 years ago. There's a reason why milk farmers are defaulting like crazy these days. 
Milk actually gets about 0.7% cheaper each year.

Open a skrill account make a transfer to that account and buy coins, can't use them for much though, but if you just want to hold them it works in most countries. Think they trade at 4% premium so not too bad.

Sure but if you said those 300 might be 900 in two year. I'd say let's talk in 2 years.
