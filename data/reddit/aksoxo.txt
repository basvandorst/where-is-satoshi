There is no correlation indeed. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:39:33
Do we know something more about Petro, like release date or something? 
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:53:33
Serious and noob question. Can Bitcoin be somehow stable in future without gov or financial interference? What conditions must be met?
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:41:06
Thanks.

Bull market is on. I want to see 10k$ this weekend 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:43:41
What a mess...
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:37:35
Don't do this. Seriously. Im from postcommunist country. ZSSR took our guns after WWII for "our safety". If they did not do this, my country (and every other postcommunist country) would win this "war for freedom" sooner than it took place. We had only Molotov and stones. I think Jefferson said exacly why people need guns. Don't belive in this love&amp;peace in disarmed nation provided by left wing.

But ban wouldn't be helpful am I right? I don't want to trade like a drug diller if you know what I mean. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:03:48
Because you want them to send your erc20 tokens right? Without KYC it might be impossible (depends on amount). 
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:07:49
Im to old for shady stuff. Also it would be only useful (crypto currencies) for illegal purposes. It means bitcoin would drop to 1k$ maybe even more. U have to do KYC if you want to trade bigger amounts (like more than 2BTC for Binance). 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:05:26
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:58:28
What's going on with market? We have so many positive news worldwide about crypto and its dropping like crazy. Any clue? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:52:41
I love this company. Great respond to every issue or report. Keep it this way. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:24:40
This is pure gold... I mean bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:04:28
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:41:17
Oh ok I misunderstood "taking guns away" sentence. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:57:50
More than 2BTC at once? Impossible
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:18:24
Same thing with Poland. Prime Minister has  already said that crypto will be banned or regulated in Poland. AFAIK government is preparing some regulations. Poland isn't big player on cryptocurrency field however it shows how similar world governments work. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:56:57
Inducing financial crisis. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:05:14
Yes and I have heard that gov will retreat. This 1% tax from single transaction was ridiculous idea. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:38:55
Maybe. Its still Sunday tho. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:46:30
It looks like u can also SELL BTC and get cash. How much is the commission? What about goverment statement? AFAIK you could only BUY BTC in this type o ATMs in Poland.

$100,000 today
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:42:39
Im waiting for 10k$ till then Im not getting excited. It might be one big bull trap. Please don't downvote me, its just my concern. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:23:27
You are missing one big point. Polish Prime Minister was a CEO of a big bank. He was always connected with financial institutions. After annual financial meeting in Davos he said that he is going to "delegalize crypto or regulate it". Actually he is doing both. 
Fun fact: look who was playing in bank commercials  ;-) 
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:12:57
This 9k$ resistance is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:26:59
It looks like 1% commission when u buy BTC. Im more interested in commission while u sell. If its also 1% then its lower than in Germany or Czech Republic. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:44:28
What was ATL bitcoin dominance? Is it now? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:48:28
Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:35:13
So basically its a great news for Poland. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 03:25:24
Its vandalism act. This doors look clean despite this. I don't like it.
