Is there any other service I can make an ACH bank transfer to in the US to buy bitcoins? If by other option to mean localbitcoins (paying 20% premiums, scheduling meetups with people and carrying unsafe amounts of cash) or wiring money overseas (good luck prosecuting fraud or tracking your money if it conveniently "disappears" on you) then I believe they are a monopoly.

No, see, that's not a part of the formula.  The narrative has to be that there is always a debate, which is usually fabricated and captures the attention of those who can't think for themselves, that way they can continue running stories and continue having talking heads proposing ridiculous ideas.  If everyone agrees, and it doesn't shock, then there is nothing to sell.  This is what the news media does to stay in business.  They make the narrative, not you.

Good luck with that.   Their co-founder is an ex Wells Fargo exec who likely has friends in high places making sure their asses don't get sued and shut down.  The barriers are there to keep competition out, and has been a problem for a long time in California.  That is all across the financial sector and is not new to cryptocurrency.  Why do you think small banks have effectively disappeared?   The KYC/AML statues effectively killed them, they cannot afford to do what large banks can.  Coinbase had to raise a ton of money but more than that they had to be in with the right people long before Coinbase was even started.  That is the reason nobody else is providing the service.

Except Google Fiber didn't come into existence in a "free market" as you've described it, and neither did the Internet.

No.   Because malware could pick it up, and it's not Google's fault if you took such a  risky behavior.  Nobody transacting in bitcoin right now DOESN'T know it's extremely risky.  Thieves are everywhere.  It sucks but until better security exists, this is going to happen.  This is why I don't promote bitcoin to anyone.... not until security gets better.

it doesn't matter that they caused monopolization.
we can only look at what happened, not what might have happened.  using your logic it would be perfectly fine to allow all the regulations in the world to proceed because we can't say whether innovation will or won't happen regardless, right?  if it doesn't happen, we can say "well it doesn't mean it would have happened if there were no regulation" -- your argument.
We did not "remove those regulations" to make Google Fiber possible.  Certain provisions can be made for such things, but that's all.  The regulations that govern telecommunication are still very much in tact, important, and relevant.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:54:28
We are not arguing about who or what failed.  We are arguing about what Coinbase says they do, right?  They say they make bitcoins as secure as possible.  This attack could easily be avoided with some very simple features, and this kind of malware is like HOW TO STEAL BITCOINS 101 shit... rewrite the To address?  DUH.  Anyone who took a introductory level course to computer security would know you analyze your risks and their likelihood of happening and this would be very high on the list.  So IMO it is marketing bullshit.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:21:03
@_date: 2014-08-16 08:34:48
So how would they deal with refund cases?  How would they charge you?  Would you give Uber your bitcoins first and let them deduct charges?  What about when a driver forgets to turn off the meter?  Do they refund you in USD equivalent if bitcoin crashes in the following days or in the equal amount of bitcoin?  
Honestly it does not seem like a natural fit to me, it seems like a headache and unnecessary.

bits = 100 satoshis , and one million bits = bitcoin.    It's stupid, I know.
Just remember bitcoin has 8 decimal places and bits are meant to "coexist" with financial software (which I think is a totally fabricated, bogus, and unsubstantiated reason -- we are past the Y2k bug era of software, but I digress) so the decimal of a bit is 2 places before the end (the end being the 8th decimal, a satoshi).

*And it was on this day, forever sewn into the blockchain, that Mark Karpeles, a servant from France, would deny that the bitcoins were gone, but that they were only "temporarily unavailable."* 
You see, just like religion, bitcoin requires faith.  Faith in the blockchain, faith in the developers, and faith in the spreaders of the good news like Mark Karpeles.  Though we no longer have our bitcoins, we are called upon by the Bitcoin community to continue spreading the good news of bitcoin.  And so we shall.
And if we should come across those ~~sinners~~ poor folks who do not appreciate bitcoin, we know our work is not done, for only when one can no longer say no to the ~~rape~~ good news of bitcoin will he or she be saved.

This is the worst logic I've ever heard.  Your "anti-regulation" stance is straight up elementary.  In the real world, we do not take all-or-nothing stances if we want progress.  Biological evolutionary processes do not take all-or-nothing stances and neither should human systems.  It just doesn't work.  Regulation is needed for some things and it needs to be crafted in the right way -- often times we get it wrong and then people like you think that all regulation is worthless and that we'd somehow be better off without rules.  Regulation is not needed for other things and could never be crafted in the right way.  Use your fucking brain, if you have one.

Why not make people pay to drive faster in their cars too?  If you want to go only 20mph you can pay $5, but if you want to go 30mph you'll have to pay $5 more, and if you want to leave the state, that's going to cost you an extra $20.  And some places you won't be allowed to visit in your car, you'll have to buy a car from another manufacturer.  But that manufacturer doesn't exist where you live, so forget about it.
The fact is people need the Internet in the modern age to be able to thrive.  And they should not have to pay more because a company thinks that certain parts of the Internet are more taxable than others.  This is nothing but corporate greed.  Without unrestricted access to the Internet, your horizons are severely limited.  Anything other than net neutrality is a slippery slope that would eventually lead to straight up censorship and fragmentation of the Internet.

Exactly.  Coinbase is lucky it makes users agree to a no-class-action lawsuit against them in using the site.  Actually, they make you basically indemnify them from any damage whatsoever, even that resulting from their own negligence.
Nobody should reasonably expect people to be able to find out their real name from an e-mail address unless they make that information public themselves.  This is nothing short of a leak.

SO the "danger" of LastPass is that it isn't Open Source, that's it?  I'm sorry but this article has almost no substance whatsoever.
Using the same logic, I think the danger of KeePass is that it IS open source.  Look at how much blind trust was put into OpenSSL.  Open source != secure.   In fact, Open Source may even heighten the risk of insecurity since the code can be attacked without obstruction.  Personally I feel more comfortable using a product with paid developers that has been successful for many years, without any incidents that should shake confidence in it.
LastPass ALSO offers 2FA, meaning you can secure your master password with a 2FA code.  This goes above and beyond what KeePass is capable of.

Totally not ideal for buying drugs or laundering money... oh wait

Talk is cheap and Coinbase does a lot of it.

augment it?
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:14:02
Yeah fuck that.

How about a hardware wallet that is isolated from these vectors of attack?

Avastar1 I think you should take some responsibility for writing such an inflammatory headline without much evidence of anything other than users may scam you.  At least change it to "I think BTCJam is a fraud!" and lose the "Get out now! rhetoric.
 Redditors could scam you too, does that make reddit a fraud?  No.  You're potentially hurting someone's business, that's not cool.

Or patented.  Apple apparently patented the technique of "poisoning the well": obfuscating your social media footprint, or in other words, automatically creating dummy data that is affiliated with your name/UDID/UUID so as to make tracking you (and therefore the data about you) worthless, and thereby making the larger dataset that might be worth selling on a market worth less.  Why they would want to do that is pretty obvious.

Coinbase puts the con back in confirmation.
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:39:05
And yet they don't seem to care to share with you who reviews this information and how it is used.
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:09:45
fuck coinbase

We want less money in politics, not more of it.

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:15:25


So why are you fixing it now and not after the first six times this guy brought it to your attention, Coinbase??
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:33:59
OMG what is with this "don't make it even more confusing for new people" theme I see running around here.  You guys worry more about the symbol being used than the fact that this subreddit also wants to change the denomination to mBTC or uBTC or something else entirely, but go on insisting people try to figure out how to secure their bitcoins using paper wallets and these things that are more confusing than anything else.
Just accept that bitcoin is confusing.  Some parts of it are really easy for people to understand -- like a symbol.  If it changes, it does not matter.  Bitcoin is bitcoin, nobody is going to be confused because the symbol changes.  I doubt if they are new they even know that bitcoin HAS a symbol.  
tldr; it's not a big deal!

What about self-restraint?

They're politically sensitive mostly because they're batshit crazy ideas.

Pretty sure you can sign yourself up... just start a fire near a crowded square...  just "set it and forget it" like the Showtime Rotisserie TM.

How is this a "Public Service Announcement" -- being a little bit conceited there, don't ya think?
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:22:55
they have ripped many people off, so fuck them
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:36:03
that would be a "Public Announcement" then.  a "Public Service Announcement", or PSA, suggests that the reason for reporting this information is that it does service for the public.  Coinbase might as well title it, "You're welcome, minions."
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:13:04
Fuck you and fuck Coinbase, Brian.
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:18:26
settle for the best you have because it's the best you can do.

"Most people are not ready to be unplugged.. (...)"
lol... equating a ponzi scheme to being unplugged from the Matrix is about as hillarious as it gets.  thank you for the laugh.
