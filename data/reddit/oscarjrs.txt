The way Bitcoin is designed prevents mining all Bitcoins before the year 2140.

That's why index funds were invented. They perform better than actively managed funds.

Bitcoin is purely backed by mathematics and the extremely limited ability of our computers to perform those mathematical calculations. Artificial intelligence will run on those same computers, so no matter how "smart" they get, Bitcoin will survive for a long time. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:40:42
Are you sure it was gemini.com?

Hey kids: read more books!

I'm still not convinced a hardware wallet is safer than an encrypted wallet.dat file. Can anyone change my view?

Crypto is not old enough to be considered a safe investing vehicle. Index funds have a long track of history behind them. Crypto is pretty much a new comer that will definitely not grow exponentially forever.  That's why everyone agrees that you shouldn't invest in crypto more than you can afford to lose. Besides, index funds give you about 8% per year on average.

That's the point.. Duh.

Just buy some for them and don't tell them. Then in a few years, if Bitcoin succeeds, you can hand them their Bitcoin.

I strongly suggest that you don't waste time with technical analysis. It's been proven over and over that it doesn't work, especially with a new technology like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:35:41
Bitcoin can become widely used, but that doesn't imply that the price will keep increasing. Bitcoin can become mainstream at 1K or any other amount per BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:40:59
How is this relevant to the OP's situation, in which he more than doubled his money? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:41:30

It's illegal to buy from someone without a license. So buy from an exchange like coinbase. It's legal everywhere in the United States. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:58:42
That doesn't answer the question. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:08:05
This is the right answer. Invest an amount that wouldn't cause you sleepless nights if it suddenly vanished. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:50:46
This is normal. Be prepared for long months of stable price. It's happened before. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:54:12
That's why I worry about the Bitcoin owners who suddenly became rich in third world countries. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:09:38
For the moment, Bitcoin will continue being the "gateway" crypto into other coins, so it will not become irrelevant any time soon.

You can educate yourself as much as you can. You're in a very good position: young and in school. Best way to succeed and make money is to study hard (school subjects as well as cryptocurrencies). As you start earning money you can invest a small portion in crypto as well as in an index fund.

I love Bitcoin, but it's not unique.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:46:57
HODL just means "don't sell". 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:02:23
It could fall well below 5k. Let's not pretend we know what will happen in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:15:15
Something similar has happened a few times already . Huge growth followed by massive crash. The thing is, BTC keeps growing over time anyways, so there is no need to worry. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:25
Lol.. No wonder people get confused. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:50:47
Is it any good?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:29:59
He obviously means selling at $10000. OP, as long as you declare your gains in your tax return, you can make much more profit and nobody would bother you, unless your bank has a bad reputation.

No offense, but if a thousand people predict the price of Bitcoin, someone is bound to be right based on nothing but luck.

He obviously works for Nationwide, not Adobe. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:43:47
People were in the same situation as you when Bitcoin reached $1200 and then plummeted a few days later. And now here we are. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:11:23
Yeah, but Bitcoin is not guaranteed to go up. It could all come collapsing to the ground. If you can afford to lose the money, go for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:53:51
Small part only. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:28:51
It's definitely a risk. Spend what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:19:15
Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. Whoever thinks they can predict the price is just guessing. The worst part is that if they happen to be right (by pure coincidence, of course), they will feel like the smartest investors in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:19:09
We just gotta let the kiddies fight and insult each other. Remember we got tons of people here  who just came out of puberty. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:26:24
Nobody knows, but it won't be much since your original investment is not too high. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:59:08
No matter what anyone tells you, NOBODY knows for sure what will happen in the future with any certainty. So invest only what you can afford to lose. It might keep on increasing or it might collapse and never reach the current prices ever again. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:42:45
Because more and more people are willing to pay for it.

What are the disadvantages of the Lightning Network compared to other alt-coins?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:52:55
Nobody, not even the experts know what will happen to Bitcoin in the future. People have been calling it a bubble since it reached $30. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:24
Because nobody cares. It's like wondering what his shoe size is. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:02:23
Wow.. Either you replied to the wrong post or you have a serious deficiency in reading comprehension. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:22:51
Is the misspelling of "lose" a new meme? I thought that by now everyone on this Subreddit would know that it's spelled "lose", not "loose". 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:24:04
So... About that prediction... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:09:38
But if you wait longer... 50% off! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:32:28
Lol.. What an irrelevant comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:16:09
Why not diversify? Own a few different Altcoins depending on their solutions to Bitcoin's problems. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:12:19
That would be a major weakness in a cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:51:00

You report the profit on your tax return for the year when you sell the Bitcoin. An accountant will help you. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:27:38
Nah, you're just obsessed with Bitcoin, like the rest of us. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:43:55
This. It's a lesson that will prevent you from making a significantly worse mistake later in life. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:00
Nobody knows for sure. The same thing happened back when it crashed from $1200 to $300 and people were worried. And here we are. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:07:22
Yes, the Bitcoin never leaves until the transaction is complete. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:44:37
I love BTC, but it could crash hard and for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:47:40
The second best time was 19 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:11
Because Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first. More people have heard of Bitcoin than of the rest of the altcoins, so people buy bitcoin without even knowing about the transaction fee problems.

Invest in your education first. The rest you can put in different assets. Don't put everything into a single asset. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:04:27
What do you mean you didn't get any? What's stopping you from buying $50 worth of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:19:10
It's just a prediction based on the fact that something cannot rise in price forever. So along the way there are drops in price, sometimes MAJOR drops in price. Nobody can predict them accurately, though. Whoever guesses a correction was just lucky.

@_date: 2017-12-17 03:15:59

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:11
Then why do you ask us? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:37:10
Not a good idea. Just buy a little bit every few weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:44:29
Tons of new coinbase accounts see the attractive price and buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:09:40
Because it might rise to 23k by Sunday and then crash to 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:50:39
OP is obviously implying that we shouldn't really care about the fiat value of BTC, since, under the ideology true believers follow, they want all their financial transactions to be seen in terms of BTC without the need to convert any of it to Dollars or pesos or euros.. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:55:21
He's right.  Where's the misinformation?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:48:53
"Invertir" is Spanish for "Invest". I'm guessing that's why OP said "Invert".
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:30:11
You're welcome! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:35:43
Lol.. Not sure if being sarcastic. Nobody guarantees that Bitcoin will succeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:21:03
Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:14:10
Isn't that XPM, not BTC? Maybe try the crypto currency Subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:38
Yeah.. I should've called it a major correction instead of crash. Credit to the polite and respectful redditor who noticed my mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:01:23
The miner basically picks random numbers and mixes them in a bag and then spits them out. If the numbers come out in a certain, very specific pattern, you've got yourself a Bitcoin. That's the ELI5 version. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:33:24
Who said people don't do that? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:26
Wow... talk about making my simple post sound like I'm a bitcoin hater who hopes all bitcoin holders will die a painful death .  You should read my post out loud, and then read your reply out loud.  
Just so you know.  I believe BTC will thrive and succeed, but it would be delusional to think it will not have crashes, just like in the past years.  That doesn't imply failure or the death of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:05:04

How successful are they at brute-forcing the password? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:39:53
Of course it would work, but it would be extremely hard to time the price right.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:54
There are large numbers of people who make a living out of SELLING bitcoin in the hopes of making money by buying low and selling high.  So obviously not all bitcoins are being held and they never will.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:26:12
Finally, an article I can recommend to prospective Bitcoin buyers. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:29:30
That's just human nature. Confirmation bias. We ignore what goes against our beliefs. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:17:14
The price of your Bitcoins increases or decreases no matter where you have them. There is no "investing" . Just buying and selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:32:57
Nobody knows what will happen to the price. There will always be bubbles and crashes, but nobody knows when they will arrive or how severe they will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:23:49
Pardon my ignorance, but who is in charge of this Lighning Network? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:13:46
Absolutely. You should make a copy of the wallet and keep it safe first. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:52
You don't know where the bottom will be.  You'll most likely sell low and when the price goes up you'll buy back at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:27:32
I hope the success of Bitcoin allows you to see your uncle. Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:57:22
I agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:39:28
Yeah, maybe. Nobody guarantees that Bitcoin will keep on going up. Maybe this is as high as it will ever get. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:45:55
Yes it is. Limited supply by design. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:06
Depends how much would it affect you if you suddenly lost the 1K.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:15
This exact same thing happened when it reached an unbelievable $1500, then crashed to $300. And look where we are now. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:47:56
There is no need for a 51% attack when BTC has already slowly been attacked from the inside!

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:29
Legal to own. If you sell, you need to pay taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:45:26
If you can afford to lose the money, then you should buy! There is a chance that BTC will grow in acceptance even more. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:34:46
Ooh... I know! I know.... Hmm... HODL? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:36:28
Doesn't work like that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:39:06
That's right. Don't fall for that bad advice. Instead get the biggest loan you can and invest it on Bitcoin.

There is a possibility that Bitcoin will decrease so much in value that you might panic sell and end up with nothing. If that scenario is OK with you, then go ahead and put everything in Bitcoin. The smart thing to do is actually to diversify your assets.

Absolutely nobody can predict what Bitcoin will be worth in the future. Invest what you can afford to lose.  
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:41:01
Not to be a pessimist, but many experts have predicted the future value of Bitcoin when the reality is that nobody knows what will happen. Just like the stock market. The worst part is that if their prediction happens to be right, they'll feel like they were smarter than the rest. A lottery winner is not an expert at playing the lottery. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:49:21
Very high.

Someone claims to have found a hard drive with 950 BTC. It's on the front page. I'm too busy to link it, but not too busy to finish this sentence with random crap. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:21:26
I'm not going to pretend like I know much about assets, but mainstream adoption doesn't necessarily mean a rise in price. Bitcoin can become mainstream and stay at current prices.

OK. No problem. I actually didn't know that it came from 4chan.

He's very popular.

Uh.. That was not drafting. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:21:03
If you can afford to lose the money, then there is no reason to be scared. If you can't afford to lose the money, you shouldn't buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:21:55
In all likelihood, those are a very small minority.

I was about to post this.

I thought that was common knowledge. Most Americans owe more than they own. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 13:55:36
That's not really a random guess. It's the typical behavior of bubbles.

Ahem... So about that "prediction"... 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:13:22
To tell you the honest truth: absolutely NOBODY knows what will happen. Crypto currencies are a revolutionary new concept and it might or might not behave like other assets. Nobody knows. You've got people buying. You've got people ready to sell at every new record price. You've got people trying to artificially pump the price. You've got more and more corporations legitimately interested and investing in Bitcoin. Too many variables! It is definitely a risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:51:32
Damn... Why are you guys so obsessed with Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:51:49
Lol.. You're kidding, right? What tone? This is so childish. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:30:14
Don't go posting the amount you own, OP. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:11:58
Nobody really knows.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:43:56
Sorry, but it could still catastrophically fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:33:03
That analogy doesn't work if you ignore all other complex inventions that actually failed. I want Bitcoin to succeed, but it's not guaranteed. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:27:48
But what if Bitcoin collapses to nothingness after your friends spent a large sum of money on it. What do you say then? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:16:43
The price prediction at the end just shows how fake that story is. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:39:17
It's not a scam but nobody guarantees the price. Nobody can promise you that it will always be worth thousands of dollars. Nobody can predict where it will be headed. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:03:13
Good post, except for the part about all alt coins being useless. Some of them are actually worth looking into. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:21:37
The problem I see is that all of these people just want to get rich with Bitcoin. The vast majority don't care about the utility of it.

I propose that we allow him to keep his ball if BTC indeed hits 10k this year.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:11:02
He was probably waiting for sub 5k prices.

People have been saying that since it was $20. "Who would pay $20 for something as useless as an internet token. Buy a steam game and you'll not regret spending the $20".

Don't want to burst your bubble but Bitcoin could collapse to nothingness.

I would say that 10% in a risky asset is not too much for younger people with good job prospects. They can handle the elevated risk.

Most of the money that I make is not losing value. It's invested in a stock index fund. Averages to 8% gain in value in the long term. Bailbtc is right.

You forgot /s.
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:16:27
So, same as every other prediction made by everyone else?
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:12:04
You should offer a good percent of the coins, not a measly $200.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:53:11
Maybe they had bought BTC at $25 and sold it at $3000. Smart move. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:52:09
I don't think anyone is counting the articles that show a great future for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:29:53
Cool. How about some predictions of failure that actually came true? 
@_date: 2016-09-27 18:12:45
Bubbles popping cannot be predicted.  They could happen in 1, 5 or 15 years.  Oh, they will definitely happen, but nobody can predict when.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:09:06
And then you'll complain about them getting hacked because they didn't keep a proper maintenance schedule. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:59:09
This needs to be said too. Nobody is guaranteeing that it will ever go back up. I believe it will go up again, but there is a small chance it might never go back up. Let's not pretend like we know what Bitcoin will do in the future.

As long as you can truly afford to lose the money, any time is a great time to buy.  It's a risk with potential rewards.

I love Bitcoin and all, but the success of the Internet does not predict the future of Bitcoin.

It's the same in the USA.

The amount of Bitcoin you buy doesn't change if you don't do anything. Only it's value changes. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:47:49
Buy, but accept the fact that you might lose the money. Spend what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:45:32
That wasn't a question. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:41:11

Away from keyboard.

Bitcoin core ok?
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:12:18
That's exactly what A LOT of people are waiting for, which means that the price won't go down as much as you might expect. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:53:35
Anyone care to explain?
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:47:37
Quick stupidly obvious question: if the wallet is encrypted with a strong password then there's nothing to worry about, right? (assuming backups exist of course) 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:55:09
This. You would probably sell at a loss just so you can avoid losing all of your money. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:10:09
Learn from your mistake. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Coinbase only insures your USD. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:22:48
The value of Cryptocurrencies cannot be predicted. They could be worth $0 or they could go up to $50,000 or more. Nobody knows. That's why you only invest in Cryptocurrencies with money you can afford to lose.

Dear noobs: nobody here can predict the future price of Bitcoin. Don't ask. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:27:38
Nobody can predict where bitcoin will be. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:46:53
This.  Let me repeat: nobody knows where Bitcoin will be in the future.  Don't listen to people who say they know.  It's basically a gamble.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:45:33
You can't lose what you never had. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:49:27

@_date: 2017-05-29 17:29:57
This. A perpetual rise in price is not guaranteed. It could all come crashing down. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:17:25
A lot of them probably sold everything when it reached "unbelievable" highs of $30, $70, etc.

If a fork happens, do people who own bitcoin need to follow certain steps, or everything happens automatically at the "server" side of things?

Don't mean to ruin everyone's party, but bitcoin can still fail catastrophically. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:55:21
Predictions like that are always based on nothing more than guesses.  And if the prediction happens to be right, it will always be followed by "I told you so!" instead of "Wow... I got lucky and guessed right!".
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:29:05
I would've probably sold em at $10 each. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:22:28
Ask yourself: if the price of Bitcoin drops... And keeps dropping... And drops some more: will you be able to resist the temptation to sell, knowing that it might keep on dropping? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:26:20
You're supposed to buy bitcoin with money you can afford to lose.  Nobody is guaranteeing that the price will go up.  It could all collapse.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:44:06
I assume that by "sensing the tendencies" you mean "being lucky."
