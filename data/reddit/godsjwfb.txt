Yeah, I think I've figured out how this particular Bitcoin forum works:
1) Don't ask any sensible questions. 
2) Don't point out the blazing contradictions in the Bitcoin narrative. 
3) Just blindly follow the crowd...and...for bonus points, vomit out nonsense about "Bcash" or "trolls" or whatever.

Yes, fair point. I'm actually not all that interested in dodging taxes to be honest. My view is that if you make a load of money, it's worth paying the capital gains tax and taking that needless worry or issue off the table. 
I'm just trying to learn more about how security and privacy work, and how I can practice safe private storage in general. Also, from a political or philosophical perspective, I'm in support of private ownership, and I'm against the surveillance state.

Well, they don't accept LN payments either, but do you reckon McDonalds will go through the bother of running LN nodes etc? And will enough people be willing to go through the bother of setting up their own LN wallet, and, of course paying the on-chain transaction fees associated with doing so? 
I get the whole digital gold thing...maybe...but I just don't see the incentive for the masses to go through all that hassle to buy a cheeseburger. 
*I'm looking for reasons to change my mind on this, though. Please do let me know why I should feel more optimistic...
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:14:50
I didn't have an argument. I had a question. It was your response that was childish. 
Again, as a neutral party or average person, why would I use the LN to pay for things? I've tried it and it's needlessly complicated and a hassle. I've compared Bitcoin as a currency to various other cryptocurrencies, and at the moment I don't see the advantage. Furthermore, I've seen interviews and read articles in which avid Bitcoin supporters themselves state that it's digital gold now and not meant for small payments. 
The above is why I've come in here to ask questions and try to figure things out.

Thanks, that's just about what I thought. I wouldn't expect to be anonymous using Binance, for example. However, on more obscure exchanges, including those with poor international relations with the USA (Russia, for example?), it seems very unlikely that the US would have the legal power to demand that sort of data.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:03:08
Hey, that's fine mate. Honestly, I don't really care. I thought I'd pop in to see the quality of discussion and I quickly got my answer. Reminds a lot of the old Crackberry forums just after the iPhone started gaining market share. 
The environment seems far to cultish for me, but you guys have fun.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:01:46
But isn't Bitcoin meant to be digital gold and a Store of Value? That's a seemingly different application than a currency such as the US dollar.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:18:44
I've already watched AA's videos, and I've noticed that even he has started to talk more generally about "crypto" rather than Bitcoin. He doesn't mention Bitcoin nearly as much as he used to. 
In any event, my motivations are plain. I want Bitcoin/crypto to indeed be viable currency for the entire world. I couldn't care less about the silly in-fighting and childish arguments. 
As the moment, Bitcoin is awful as money. Hopefully that will change. I don't give a damn about Tone Vays v Roger Ver, or any of that playground nonsense. 
Again, all I was looking for was clarification as to what the "plan" is, other than for the price to go up.
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:37:08
Thanks very much.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:30:05
Very good advice. Many thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:42:09
What does that even mean? 
Anyway, this seems like a certified cult to me. You guys are some of the most insecure and reactionary people on the Internet. So bizarre.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:01:02
You seem to be obsessed with Bitcoin Cash. I haven't once even brought BCH up. This all started because I asked a basic and obvious question as to what Bitcoin is supposed to be now. I've read the whitepaper, and I've followed the statements of Bitcoin supporters in the media...
No one in the Bitcoin community is even talking publicly about Bitcoin being money anymore, which is why I asked the question. 
If Bitcoin is now supposed to be gold, that's fine. I was just asking. As a matter of fact, the reason I asked in the first place was because I had just watched Novogratz state explicitly that Bitcoin is digital gold and not a viable currency. It had nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash whatsoever. Again, you guys seem to get easily triggered and I think you need help.
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:09:51
Thanks guys. These responses are really useful.
@_date: 2019-07-05 13:37:40
@_date: 2019-07-07 09:16:27
I had a post of mine deleted within minutes for absolutely no reason at all. All I did was ask someone whether Bitcoin was supposed to be "digital gold" or a viable currency for everyone. Honestly, it got deleted in under five minutes.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:21:39
Yes, you raise some good points. I'm just trying to figure out whether people will prefer to use the LN, or just use another faster, cheaper crypto. I've invested in Bitcoin, and a few others, but I'm trying to think ahead and consider whether Bitcoin is or is not going to be the MySpace or AltaVista of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:04:50
Billions of people already have opened bank accounts and pay for things using fiat. I'm trying to figure out why they would bother with the LN when they could just use fiat, or Libra, or Bitcoin Cash or Nano or any other cryptocurrency. 
Instead of good, solid arguments, all I ever get in response is a bunch of childishness. I haven't been around long, but I can't understand why anything other than OMG Bitcoin is Amazing gets greeted with such reactionary and childish behaviour. 
Is this a serious advancement in money, or a cult?
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:26:52
I've been in Reddit for literally a few days. You want people new to the platform to go back through thousands and thousands of posts to see if something they have said has been said before? 
As I happens, I was actually asking the question after watching some interviews with Bitcoin bulls in the media, and I noticed that 0% of them spoke about Bitcoin being a viable currency for the world. 
What is not beneficial to Bitcoin is a universal echo chamber where valid questions about fundamental issues lead to Bitcoin proponents running away or engaging in childish name calling or deleting posts.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:43:56
Even if it isn't complicated, where is the incentive to use it? You need to pay two on-chain transactions to use the LN anyway. It's not at all obvious to me that most people won't just throw it in the bin.
Also, what is LN doesn't catch on? Then what?
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:54:28
Thank you. That is the most rational and grown-up comment I've read so far.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:54:18
Every time I enter any Bitcoin-related chat or forum, I leave having even less confidence in Bitcoin than I had before. It seems as though the entire Bitcoin community is full of petulant children. It's unbelievable.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:42:54
What are the rules?
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:22:18
Okay, thank you. I'll take a look
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:04:45
Yes, fair point. I'll be honest: I'm just a regular person looking to keep my funds as private and anonymous as possible 1) for safety 2) just in case the government decides to come up with some dumb law in the future that puts my economic freedom in jeopardy. Also, I enjoy learning more about how all of this works. 
That being said, I imagine the odds of the US government going to those lengths to find out how much Bitcoin I have is very unlikely. I'm not moving 100+ BTC, and I'm not a criminal or anything. 
Finding a few past obscure exchange transactions five years from now seems like looking for a needle in a haystack the size of the solar system. 
Fingers crossed anyway haha.

If a Big Mac in Switzerland costs the equivalent of roughly $6.50 USD, how much will it cost if you pay in Bitcoin, once factoring in the transaction fee, assuming McDonald's wants the transaction confirmed before you leave the restaurant?
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:51:59
What are the lines? I'm curious.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:12:17
How many people do you know who need to move millions of dollars....and then somehow need to care about whether is costs more than 35 cents?
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:42:18
Bitcoin stores value, except when it doesn't store value. As for using it as money...it's garbage. I wish that weren't true...but it is.
@_date: 2019-11-28 22:08:20
You obviously don't "use" Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2019-11-28 22:34:45
That's not true. He didn't come up with the 1MB block limit until a year into Bitcoin, and then he disappeared. Anyway, the explanation is simple: Bitcoin used to be fast and cheap, and now it's slow and expensive. It absolutely sucks for anything other than trading on Binance or wherever and waiting around for MOON.
@_date: 2019-11-28 19:56:19
From my experience, there is a lot of utter nonsense out there on this topic, and it often gets dragged into the Bitcoin debate to distract from the fact that a bunch of idiots have decided to destroy the usefulness of Bitcoin as money or currency. 
Sadly, you often can't even point this out politely without being called a "troll". 
I literally never use Bitcoin as money/currency anymore, because it's simply way too slow and needlessly expensive.
@_date: 2019-11-28 09:47:23
Wait, Bitcoin is a currency again? These people are hilarious.
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:34:21
Oh, so the IP connection has nothing to do with the blockchain? Okay, this has been an area of confusion for me for some time. I couldn't understand how that stuff was "recorded". I still find it confusing, but that's helpful. Thanks.
