When will the layman without a computer science background be able to use it?

Except I can’t buy my groceries with bitcoin. So not better. Maybe in a decade. Right now this is just vandalism.

It’s weird that you fantasize about him.

Good advice: buy a ledger nano and store your coin off line. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:54:49
Or just monitor and license certain exchanges.

Don’t use coinbase as your major exchange. It’s more of the convenient store. If things are ever fucked coinbase will be too overloaded to do anything.

Get a ledger and a safety deposit box.

Lol. Keep digging. You’ve almost found pizzagate.

A small security box at a bank can cost 75 per year. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:12:02
Banks can’t do that. If it’s impossible to give it a value it’s weird that it has a value. I don’t think you have any idea what you’re talking about.

Again that’s not what free speech is. People don’t have to host anyone. It is purely a government citizen relationship. You’ve got to understand that.

It’s trusting in America’s production capacity and growth. These days I wouldn’t think that’s the best bet.

At this time crypto doesn’t have a financing wing. I cant get crypto to give me a business loan. This post is dumb. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:33:03
Oh you’re doing satire. My mistake. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:44:58
Pretty sure this is a scam.

Wall Street is back to work tomorrow. I expect the big buy to continue.
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:15:14
That’s not how free speech works. It guarantees freedom from government harassment.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:38:40
Sooo what is bitcoin worth. You seem to have an understanding of the true value. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:42:43
If by heading there you mean it’s never been done and no one knows how it could be done and that’s not how smart contracts work then sure.

The tank comment is a bit weird. Calvary was made obsolete way before the tank was invented. While there was a stupid charge in WW1, rifle squads in the napoleonic wars ended Calvary charges. For example, Calvary was rarely used in American Civil War advances. 
Tanks replaced calvary like the machine gun replaced the musket.

I would give that guy such a stern look, then I turn my head slowly back and forth as to say ‘no’. It would be so satisfying.
