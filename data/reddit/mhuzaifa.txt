I have mentioned this link in the very beginning of my post. This was reproduced to celebrate the Bitcoin's 5th year and to deliver this story to all the new non-tech and tech audience discovering btc, who didn't read or knew about Hal. Thanks

Are you ok if I include your comment in the post with your username or real name? (Including permalink to this comment)

I always write original posts but since I know that Medium readers are super lazy they do not navigate to links shared unless you reproduce the content as post. 
I have given credit to Hal in the beginning of the post, I have also shared the link the original post. 
FYI Gawker, Gizmodo, Lifehacker etc are always reproducing posts from reddit or any other blog this a universal practice not just limited to Medium or any other blogging platform.

I appreciate your response and I 100% agree with you but most readers on medium do not navigate to other links, it was reproduced just to make it easier to read for the average reader. 
And yes Medium inserts my name automatically, I do not have control over it although I will add more credit to end of of the post. Thanks

Lets make a movie based on your story? :D haha

Yes I understand that but at the same time there are several non-Google marketplaces that are very active. I will not distribute the marketplace app through Google Play.

This is a good idea if established game developers support it.

You'd have to trust the Escrow provider with your coins, it would be hard to find a solution that lets you keep/block certain coins in your wallet and provide escrow services to the concerned parties. But its a great idea, would make it easy for new escrow providers to enter the market.

Wow this is great just saw your Group Buy, I wish you good luck and success with your project. 
This is a great idea, you are right about the insurance and amount limit. As the market grows we would need insurance for higher transaction limits, its easy too but need capital and lots of talent to pull off such a platform for Escrow Services.

Alex the demo isn't working, please share a working link. Thanks

Yes CC are painful, just last year I was trying to signup for Android developer account and it took Google 7 months (yes you read it right its seven) to verify my CC. Thanks

Jesus, why I didn't thought of that first! you are absolutely right. Soon we will enter into a "BTC ASIC miner e-waste" phase, recycling them or to use them for another purpose would become a big market. Thanks :)

I agree with you, I am developing a custom Android App Marketplace with bitcoin as payment option. You can download the marketplace on your phone just like you have Google Play on your phone. 
It would make it much easier for the user to buy Android apps on his phone using Bitcoin. Although I suspect that Google might try to block the app since it will be competing to Google Play but I plan to distribute it through mobile web and direct download links.

Sharing it would allow you to gain early customer feedback, Bitcoin community would love to hear it and would provide their suggestions and feedback to improve it. Thanks :) 
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:46:45
Good point, I completely agree with you. I will keep your comment highlighted during development process. Thanks
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:05:44
I exist, don't delete me from the internet! :D please share your thoughts and ideas here too, it helps to get feedback from thousands on BTC users who will read your comments.

Thanks Mahn! 
@_date: 2013-10-15 07:20:17
Haha, yes! :D

This is actually a good idea, as noted by Phil more and more services will pop up to provide buying support on popular e-commerce websites. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:24:05
These are great ideas and I believe would be really useful to stable the overall economy for BTC.

Brick and mortar represents a big opportunity but would require much capital and resources to implement a proper system. 
We can start with online stores for example a service which lets you shop on Amazon OR Ebay with BTC. 
Or a Credit/Debit Card to be used with your BTC wallet, if you shop with it on B&amp;M stores you would spending BTC but the merchant will receive payment in dollars in his bank account. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:53:21
You can use TransferWise for it. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:35:39
That's a possibility, as noted by PInt Airbnb comp 9flats already does that and accepts BTC. I support your idea but instead of food start with something big like gold/silver barter with bitcoin or other similar markets. With food your profit margins would be much lower and you wouldn't be able to provide lower prices as compared to their dollar alternatives.
