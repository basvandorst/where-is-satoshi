How long have you been in the game? and what’s causing you to lose faith now rather than the umptieth times bitcoin’s been challenged in the past?

And still down.  Anyone know what's going on?Edit: Due to a large DDOS attack the datacenter has null routed our IP addresses during the night. Servers themselves are fine.

your analogy is specious.
With tech the choice is buy now or buy later.  With currency the choice is buy now with dollars, or buy now with bitcoin.  Very different set of choices.
If both are equally convenient, I would choose to use dollars, and keep my bitcoin because their value grows.  I'd only use bitcoin if the convenience vs my other currency choices pleases me more than the pleasure I'd get from my bitcoins' potential growth.

Downvoting.Turn this forum into a gender battle why don't you.  The fact that bitcoin community is an immature sausage fest (see upvotes despite this being an embarassing complainer post) is something we should be hiding for the sake of mass appeal.

Not denying, but repelling.

Did u read the comment I was responding to?  I was precisely trying to discourage a gendered flame war.

Yes and the savings would be the only reason most pple (pple who arent emotionally invested in bitcoin) would consider it.Still, that doesn't refute that a deflationary currency encourages saving, and a deflationary currency encourages spending. In fact, it's a workaround for that characteristic of bitcoin.

Fuuck this is going to be a major trap.  Isn't it best practice to register neighboring domains?
