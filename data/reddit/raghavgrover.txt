Don't try to time the market :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:21:28
If tether blows up it might , until that is clear i dont see it happening. I mean who's selling here ( people who bought at highs? really? ) when all the dips are being bought up. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:46:26
Look at this guys. Looks like ban might not be in play and might be a fake news from Reuters.
 
Look at his other tweets as well.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:44:02
Lot of investors heavily invested. Too big to ban at this time and it's a democracy and not like China . That bill will be burnt . Glad i caught 13k dip. Couldn't catch 12800 but that's ok.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:40:28
It's just panic selling man. Relax. On 1 hour chart it's still a higher low.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:11:58
Looks like another scam in the works.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:02:19
My god. So much FUD last night.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:56:37
This is good for crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:18:46
Exchanges like Coinbase etc once they adapt to Segwit i think that will also help release the burden as major volume of transsactions happens in these exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:18:27
And down again :P. I am just hodling man. Dont know what's going on.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:39:48
yeah it was 63 on Gdax
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:42:17
Nothing is going to happen i am sure of it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:40:08
Where i can see some stats for LN on mainnet?
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:42:45
right , they also don't want to scare new investors by taking it too low at a point where a new investor interest goes away.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:14:51
Guys what just happened? Is this related to FUD news about South Korean exchanges getting raided? Or just a normal shit storm. When this correction will be over duhh
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:29:55
Sell for USDT on Binance?
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:36:29
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:11:02
I can feel it in my bones.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:49:28
I am getting tired of watching all this selling. When this bear phase will be over .  :(

ETH ( 30% ) , XRP ( 30% ) , LTC ( 20% ) , DASH ( 10% ) , NEO ( 10% ).
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:37:04
how is it not safe if it's insured and have offline vaults?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:36:10
look at this
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:10:30
Try sending your coins to gdax from coinbase. Gdax is an exchange of coinbase and transfers between them is instant and free. Then use GDAX to send elsewhere it's completely free.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:02:55
here you go
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:06:17
Are you sure? Is there any credible source of this information. I am hearing it's some fake news from some redditors.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:37:52
ADA , XRP , IOTA , QTUM , NEO , REQ , BCH
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:27:23
Use GDAX limit orders , 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:28:34
Depends on when you entered in ETH dude. There were lot of 275-300 days to buy at.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:10:59
Do we have any confirmation or source that Bitstamp is supporting B2x for this Dec 28 fork?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:41:42
backup again. Reversed from near by 0.382 level.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:41:36
When is it happening?
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:09:29
I made up mind , i am not sending any BTC to their exchange. Unless some big ass exchanges confirm they are supporting , aint worth the risk loosing stuff on these exchanges etc.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:07:04
Guys i need a clarification ( thanks in advance ) : Has anybody used Bitstamp exchange here? I just tried sending some BTC to Bitstamp from Gdax. In my Bitstamp account there are two BTC addresses one in green ( Segwit address) and one in black ( legacy? ) and i sent it to the one in black format. Does it makes any difference which address i use or both will work? It has a disclaimer there though saying "Green BTC addresses are segwit addresses and are fully backward compatible with legacy addresses." . I just want to make sure the one i used will work which is legacy one
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:12:35
Look at this as well and github commits? Not sure if itsblegit news or not
I am reading some chatter in BTC forum.
Still not sure but may be it's happening?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:30:49
i feel lot of useless ALTS are going to get sorted out in 2018. BTC still is the king and market movements are mostly copied , just look at some charts. I do however have lot of ALTS but price action wise they are for some reason strongly tied to BTC price movements and the least one tied to BTC movements is Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:37:22
Well i just signed up for Hit BTC and they have done an announcement on the exchange to support it. You get the message as soon as sign up and sign in.
So there should be something happening i guess. This might not be the original corr team doing this fork but some other team choosing the same name i guess.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:20:52
Guys can someone really confirm if this Dec 28 fork thing is real or a scam ? I can see an announcement from HitBTC supporting it. I dont see other exchanges like Bitstamp , Bitrrex doing any announcements.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:07:46
I am not . I am keeping them in Gdax only. Dont want to loose my coins.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:40:18
This post needs to be highlighted. SCAM Alert
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:24:56
Why dont you transfer from Gdax? It's free. I just sent 0.02 BTC from Gdax to Bitstamp as a test and i got exact 0.02 BTC there.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:31:46
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:23:17
Gdax/coinbase is safe and insured , but yeah planning to get a ledger very soon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:22:40
Depends if you want both and then keep both. You never know where things goes BCH moves up ( diversified portfolio ) . Or sell BCH to buy back in BTC , totally upto you but they are distinct.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:37:35
No proof just words.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:40:58
Don't react to all this news. Trend is your friend.
Look at long picture and see if this low is higher than a previous lows on a much larger scale.
I would say hodl if you really don't need the money as of now.
This is again a shake out.
Tether fud has been around since last year with basically no proof. Someone just writing a paper today and everone just starts panic.
Who's buying all that cheap BTC?
I ain't selling at all. I am a buyer here.
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:06:42
Indeed it helps the ether community. Uncertainty causes a lot of pain. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:56:44
This is extremely bullish for BTC
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:18:52
Lets sign this petition
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:39:44
You're damn right. I think a lot of new investors who fomoed in last three months might have sold at loss and given their money to whales. Lessons are learnt hard way. Even though i am at unrealized loss ( you're not at loss unless you sell ) I REFUSE to sell my core stack to some whale.
My hands are getting stronger and stronger through every bear phase like we had last year as well. I also love the fact of how every other coin copies the BTCs price action.lol
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:33:21
I think it went live on 2nd July...they just re posted the news.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:51:45
Did you guys read this? Testimonies and what they want to talk about ? I dont see anything bad for cyrpto in general but good things in here.
