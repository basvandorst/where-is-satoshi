Its possible and it has been done in the past. As far as I know, there are a least 5 photos stored on the blockchain. With that said, its both difficult and incredibly costly to do so.
Basically you have to break down the image file into hex code and then place the hex code into the transaction. You then have to pay a huge fee due to the fact that the transaction is abnormally large, and in most cases you have to break the image down into multiple transactions. While it is possible that one could theoretically build a blockchain that supports images and potentially even videos, the Bitcoin blockchain isn't particular conducive to this at this point.

That's somewhat concerning, especially if you just opened your account yesterday. That would suggest one of three things:
1) Local Bitcoins might be compromised and someone is collecting the new email signups on a daily basis.
2) They are actively selling information and doing it on a constant basis. This seems unlikely.
3) Your email provider sells their list rather than LBC.

lol what type of bank is going to hand over such a huge amount of coins. Simply acquiring that would be a challenge.

Interesting, would be cool if it actually was him, although I doubt he'd like the attention.

I used CoinWallet once and was impressed. Their fees for deposits and withdrawals are a little high, but its hard to beat getting an envelope stuffed with cash :)

I love namecheap. Even if they didn't accept Bitcoin, I would consider them an amazing registrar. The fact that they accept it places them even higher in my books.
What I find most impressive about Namecheap is that they're a successful business that doesn't need to leech off of the Bitcoin bug, but instead embraces it for the betterment of humanity.

This precise subreddit. Its usually way ahead of Coindesk in terms of providing information. I assume you meant Coindesk rather than Coinbase.

Hopefully something more legit than their current project which caters primarily to carders. Ugh.

I would say that your best bet to do this would be to make it relatively small compared to the main object in the image. Alternatively, you could try to use a picture where a QR code might be normal. For example, a picture of a car on a freeway, and then in the background a billboard that has a QR code on it (perhaps for a typical shady lawyer or something). 
Anyway, instead of a web address, it could be a small QR code of the Bitcoin private key. I would however make a backup just incase he/she has troubles importing it to a wallet.

That isn't really insider trading. Coindesk is usually a bit behind when it comes to reporting the news, and even if they were the ones breaking the news, it wouldn't be insider trading.

I still fail to see how this is any better than simply using a centralized server based system. I like Bitcoin and all, but it seems that the philosophy of putting everything on the blockchain, just cause, is the current fad. Bitcoin is Bitcoin... banks are banks... why do they need to engage in some sort of unholy matrimony.

I would much prefer keep my bitcoin in an actual cold storage wallet, rather than trusting some third party such as this. While they may not hold the private keys, there's always an additional layer of risk when using some other service. Just like when blockchain.info was hacked due to poor entropy.

It really depends on where you are and how much you are willing to pay. Some exchanges don't require any information, like CoinWallet, who you can just send cash to.

That may have been $50 at the time. If so, this isn't really news...
