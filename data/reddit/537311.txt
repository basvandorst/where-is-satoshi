You only need the signatures to validate the transaction.  After its mined and in a block,  no one is ever going to care about the signatures. You can move them out. doesn't effect its decentralization.

Ok.. go here: 
upload your image ( i did it with my daughter's picture in the hospital with me and her mum, with the date, gps, time etc written on the picture. )
make sure you select sha256
then you get a string like: 236ED3FC379EFD144B0C0D67D882E542DBE9D6298F12119BD0C6ED28054C8F5A
now, take that (which is the hash of the file, represented in HEX format) and go to bitaddress.org. Then click on wallet details. You'll see: 
Enter Private Key:  
it takes all of these format: WIF, WIFC, HEX, B64, B6, MINI, BIP38 and you have a HEX value. 
paste that in there. click view detail. then you see the public address and private key. 
Now, send  a satoshi to that address. in this case, the address is: 1FaBJJwaiGYQpeonf9STTcn32c2KnGe8EA  
tadaaaa  as long as you have the original file, you can always make that address. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:56:13
Get the hash of those images and then use bitaddress to create a wallet using that hash.  (under wallet details) 
Then send a Satoshi to that address.  Donezo

This is the best way in my opinion. 
go here: 
select 24 words and hit generate. (don't try to get fancy and supply your own entropy!) 
you'll get 24 words. Write them down on a piece of paper. better yet, go to amazon and buy [this]( and hammer them into [this]( 
now, keep that somewhere super safe. maybe make two of them and dig a hole in your backyard and stick one in it. 
also, stop using electrum. They use a different seed standard which doesn't work with other things. That seed will work with mycelium, Ledger nano, Trazor, etc)

Edison was a piece of shit who used to execute elephants to show the "dangers of AC power" and stole several ideas from the true genius Tesla. Edison and JP Morgan destroyed Tesla and Westinghouse. Please, stop quoting that man. 
Edison == Unlimited  
Tesla == Core. 
and if you have liquidated most of your bitcoin, then you have no stake in this. And if you're not going to spend time informing yourself about each decision, then don't get involved. Sit back, have a cup of tea and let the chips fall where they may.

If BU decides to fork the fuck off, it is NOT because of half the network found a different solution to the Sha256 Proof of Work, but it's because they have decided to CHANGE the consensus rules with the rest of the network and consequently, they are NO LONGER in Nakamoto Consensus, now are they?? Now, please sit the fuck down, and pay attention and stop being a smart ass.

Witness means signatures In this case. Segregated means to separate them.  Means move signatures out of the blockchain in a different data structure.  It's like.... let's clean the trunk get rid of these Gulf clubs you never use and that stupid Halloween costume and all these smelly cloths,  these cisco books and the rest of that  junk so we can have more room.

On one side, you have a group of people (over a hundred) of top minds in crypto development who are called "core" who have been working on bitcoin for a long time. They are lead by company called blockstream which employees some of the top core developers so they can work on bitcoin full-time. Who is in charge of blockstream? Non other than Adam Back, one of the only people who was sited on the bitcoin white-paper by satoshi, and one of the original cypherpunks who have been working on decentralized digital money since the early 90s. 
who is on the other side? A small group of "developers" who have forked an old version of bitcoin core and called it bitcoin unlimited, and made some modifications to it mainly allowing miners to decide on the block size, (not fully understanding the full code or the ramifications ) hence the the bug, and they are lead by a man name Roger Ver who is a known con man, a man who said MT Gox was solvent days before it tanked, who got involved in bitcoin early on for some reason and became filthy rich and now is working with one of the biggest mining equipment manufacturers to block adoption of SegWit, something that core has been working on for around 2 years. Why? because Segwit allows transfer of bitcoin from Alice to Bob without going through the blockchain (less fees for miners.. duh) Another notable character on this side is Gavin Andrseren who again got involved early and was working with Satoshi in the early days and the day he told satoshi he is going to talk to the CIA was the day Satoshi stopped talking to everyone. 
Gee... i wonder which side i should support.

If they don't follow the established rules, they will leave consensus and now they are a shitcoin. 


No, we are not. This is the crux of the matter and we seem to completely disagree. 


Oh now it's changed. So, if bunch of banks take over all the nodes and bunch of Tech giants take over the mining, then they can just simply change whatever they want? no.. this is not how this works! this is not how any of this works! The market will decide what is the true bitcoin and clearly they decided to not follow BU. Period.

BU is not scaleable. We can't just put everything in the blockchain. Do you really think that the same blockchain that settles my "coffee" payment should also be used to settle every other transaction from Billions of people, including IoT + all the other crap people are building on top of bitcoin like Factum and Identity systems.
Talk about getting obsolete. We need a L2. We need LN. we need Segwit. What BU is trying to do is not fucking scaleable. And the fact that they are actively blocking segwit and spamming the network tells me this is active hostile take over and you cunts will pay for this. I hope you lose all your BTC by converting the to BTU and failing like Litecoin. Have fun with your BTU shitcoin.

On one side, you have a group of people (over a hundred) of top minds in crypto development who are loosely called "core" who have been working on bitcoin for a long time. They are lead by company called blockstream which employees some of the top core developers so they can work on bitcoin full-time. Who is in charge of blockstream? Non other than Adam Back, one of the only people who was sited on the bitcoin white-paper by satoshi, and one of the original cypherpunks who have been working on decentralized digital money since the early 90s. who is on the other side? A small group of "developers" who have forked an old version of bitcoin core, and made some modifications to it, (not fully understanding the full code) hence the the bug, and they are lead by a man name Roger Ver who is a known con man, a man who said MT Gox was solvent days before it tanked , who got involved in bitcoin early on for some reason and became filthy rich and now is working with one of the biggest mining equipment manufacturers to block the adoption of SegWit, something that core has been working on for around 2 years that will not only fix the transaction malubility bug, but it opens the door for a slew of new applications,. (Why? less fees for miners.. duh) Another notable character on this side is Gavin Andrseren who again got involved early and was working with Satoshi in the early days and the day he told satoshi he is going to talk to the CIA was the day Satoshi stopped talking to everyone. Gee... i wonder which side i should support.

so, lets say they fork and they take 80% of the miners (hashing power). That means 20% will be left for the smaller chain. Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty of the "math problem" every two weeks (roughly) and knowing these guys, since they  are weapons grade cunts, they will fork the first day of the 2 week difficulty change. This means the chain with 20% (probably BTC) will slow to a halt since the math problem is way too hard, and 20% of the miners are going to have a hard time finding blocks. Which means, the two weeks becomes way way longer which forces Bitcoin (BTC) to change Proof-of-work. That means you can start mining on your computer again! :D. Are you not entertained? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:40:21

can you nmap your server from inside of your network to see if you see 8333 open? IF you see it open from a local network host's perspective, then it's not a local FW issue and its either not getting forwarded by your router, or getting filtered on the router.

I'll be called a "tin-foil hatter" for saying this, but I don't care. Bitcoiners always talk about how you can't stop bitcoin unless you shut down the internet. While that may be true in a technical sense, you -can- however destroy bitcoin via other means. This is clearly one of them. It is so obvious that it's glaring. I mean, it has a name FFS, it's called Divide-and-conquer. And in this case, conquering just means destroying it. They will not stop. You thought they are just going to throw in the towel that easily? First it was XT, then it was Classic, now this BU-llshit. It will not stop. Like your body, the bitcoin organism has to continuously fight off attacks from viruses and bacteria.

difficulty adjusts every two weeks. Depending on when the fork happens, it could take a very long time to even find a block. if say, on the 13th the difficulty adjusted and on the 14th they fork and take away 60% of the hashing power or more, the chain with 40% will not be able to find blocks as fast which makes the two week period much longer. If they fork, all, bets, are, off and we might even have a proof of work change to where you could mine on cpu again.

On one side, you have a group of people (over a hundred) of top minds in crypto development who are called "core" who have been working on bitcoin for a long time. They are lead by company called blockstream which employees some of the top core developers so they can work on bitcoin full-time. Who is in charge of blockstream? Non other than Adam Back, one of the only people who was sited on the bitcoin white-paper by satoshi, and one of the original cypherpunks who have been working on decentralized digital money since the early 90s. 
who is on the other side? A small group of "developers" who have forked an old version of bitcoin core, and made some modifications to it, (not fully understanding the full code) hence the the bug, and they are lead by a man name Roger Ver who is a known con man, a man who said MT Gox was solvent days before it tanked, who got involved in bitcoin early on for some reason and became filthy rich and now is working with one of the biggest mining equipment manufacturers to block adoption of SegWit, something that core has been working on for around 2 years. Why? because Segwit allows transfer of bitcoin from Alice to Bob without going through the blockchain (less fees for miners.. duh) Another notable character on this side is Gavin Andrseren who again got involved early and was working with Satoshi in the early days and the day he told satoshi he is going to talk to the CIA was the day Satoshi stopped talking to everyone.

Essentially what will happen is that you'll have the same amount of coins on both chains. If it forks and you had 10 BTC, after the fork you'll have 10 BTC and 10 BTUs. it's best to keep your bitcoin offline on a paper-wallet since you can't be sure what the exchanges are going to do after the fork. It's not worth risking. Just move them to a paper wallet, heat up some popcorn and watch decentralization do its thing.

@_date: 2017-03-22 21:59:37


Some anon. It doesn't matter. 


Users are in charger. The HODLers are in charge. You see, overwhelming majority of bitheads are smarter than your average people. If they were smart enough to understand the value of bitcoin, they are smart enough to see through Roger's snake oil. You think bitcoiners are happy about centralized mining? No. You think they see value in a coin that is going more toward centralization? You are out of your mind to think so. We know who writes good code and who writes shit code and if are still on the fence, then i have no hope for you and you might as well go get on the OneCoin train. 
The miners have no power here and they will be fired if they overstep their bounds. Have you not met the honey badger?

clearly you don't understand what supporting means. Core team.. (over a hundred people) who wrote the code &gt; some BUllshit team with a guy in charge by the name of Bitcoin Jesus, who hasn't contributed a single line of code to the project and is a proven con-man, and the only reason why he got involved in bitcoin in the early days was to... who the fuck nows.. con someone some how. 
Please.. let the core do their job. Im a network engineer. And if I say, We are not going to span that vlan across because X- Y and Z, I swear if I hear some Bozo off the street (user) telling me I should do that while they don't understand the concept of Spanning-tree I would shoot myself in the ear. 
Now please..... go away.

Here is proof 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:16:42
On one side, you have a group of people (over a hundred) of top minds in crypto development who are loosely called "core" who have been working on bitcoin for a long time. They are lead by company called blockstream which employees some of the top core developers so they can work on bitcoin full-time. Who is in charge of blockstream? Non other than Adam Back, one of the only people who was sited on the bitcoin white-paper by satoshi, and one of the original cypherpunks who have been working on decentralized digital money since the early 90s. 
who is on the other side? A small group of "developers" who have forked an old version of bitcoin core, and made some modifications to it, (not fully understanding the full code) hence the the bug, and they are lead by a man name Roger Ver who is a known con man, a man who [said MT Gox was solvent days before it tanked]( , who got involved in bitcoin early on for some reason and became filthy rich and now is working with one of the biggest mining equipment manufacturers to block the  adoption of SegWit, something that core has been working on for around 2 years that will not only fix the transaction malubility bug,  but it opens the door for a slew of new applications,. (Why? less fees for miners.. duh) Another notable character on this side is Gavin Andrseren who again got involved early and was working with Satoshi in the early days and the day he told satoshi he is going to talk to the CIA was the day Satoshi stopped talking to everyone. 
Gee... i wonder which side i should support.

Call me a skeptic, but i don't believe a word you say. I doubt you talk to any "core dev", tweets don't count. 
The point is, that if we introduce SegWit and stop the spam by Big-blockers, there is no need for a hard-fork yet. Bumping to 2MB is just kicking the can down the road, and a shitty kick at at. if this experiment we call bitcoin is going to be used by everyone in the future, 2MB, 8MB, 20MB, 100MB, a fucking Gig block is not enough. we need LN or something similar to tackle the scaleability. Hardforking to 2MB ain't gonna do shit! The fact that BU clowns don't even include segwit in their version tells me all I need to know who we are dealing with.

No, actually Satoshi was noticeably dismayed when he realized that Laszlo was able to mine on his GPU. He wrote to him: 


I don’t mean to sound like a socialist, I don’t care if wealth is concentrated, but for now, we get more growth by giving that money to 100% of the people than giving it to 20%. Also, the longer we can delay the GPU arms race, the more mature the OpenCL libraries get, and the more people will have OpenCL compatible video cards. If we see from the difficulty factor that someone is using too much GPU, we can certainly pick this OpenCL stuff up again then. Maybe my effort to maintain GPU innocence is running out of time. It’s worked out so far.
I'm sure his vision was NOT to have a company in China be the main dominate supplier of ASIC chips! he was not happy about people not being able to have OpenCL compatible video cards, let alone have a couple of chip manufacturers. These miners are actually becoming a pest.  As someone said:

This &gt; means greater than. This &lt; means Less than. == means equal to.  


First of all, gavin wrote shit code. Most of his shit had to be rewritten. 
Secondly, [Adam was sited in the bitcoin white paper...]( DO YOU UNDERSTAND??  Adam back invented a technology that is at the heart of how bitcoin works, and Gavin wrote some shit code getting help from Satoshi.  To compare the two, is like comparing Nikola Tesla, and some guy who did a shitty job fixing my AC motor!

I like to point out exhibit A. (ETC). you are wrong. Lets see what else you have cooking in your hat rack. And ETC support (support for the DAO hacker) is WAY WAYYY WAAAY **wwwayyyyyy** less than BU-llshit. 


Thats assuming that that other people, (either for money, or the fact that they don't support BUllshit) are going to dust off old miners and start mining. 


You mean like ETC. ETC is still alive and kicking.

probably change the whole POW. If they take away 80% of the hashing power, they can easily use 20% of it to attack the old chain. If they fork off, I see the POW changing.

that is basically doing a port-scan from outside. you don't know if it's your host or the router that is blocking. Nmap is a port-scanning tool you can install on your computer. that way you can also do a scan from inside. If you still see it blocked, then you can ignoe the router and forwarding for now and focus on the host. 
hope that helps

On one side, you have a group of people (over a hundred) of top minds in crypto development who are loosely called "core" who have been working on bitcoin for a long time. They are lead by company called blockstream which employees some of the top core developers so they can work on bitcoin full-time. Who is in charge of blockstream? Non other than Adam Back, one of the only people who was [sited on the bitcoin white-paper by satoshi]( , and one of the original cypherpunks who have been working on decentralized digital money since the early 90s. who is on the other side? A small group of "developers" who have forked an old version of bitcoin core, and made some modifications to it, (not fully understanding the full code) hence the bugs, and they are lead by a man name Roger Ver who is a known con-man.  A man who said [MT Gox was solvent days before it tanked]( , who got involved in bitcoin early on for some reason or other, and became filthy rich and now is working with one of the biggest mining equipment manufacturers, [Jihan Wu]( to block the adoption of SegWit, and upgrade that core has been working on for around 2 years, that will not only fix the transaction malleability bug, but it also opens the door for a slew of new applications. Why you ask? less fees for miners.. duh! Off chain transactions means less transactions settled on the blockchain means less money for them. Another notable character on this side is Gavin Andrseren, who again got involved early on and was working with Satoshi, and the day he told satoshi he is going to talk to "have a little chat with the CIA" was the day Satoshi stopped talking to everyone. Gee... I wonder which side i should support.

Fair enough.... Then why don't you let the core team, which by they way, is a list of over hundred regular contributors and over 250 casual contributors do their job. Also, i can't believe i missed this from your last comment:


BU DOES NOT HAVE ANY COMPETENT PROGRAMMERS!!!!!!!!!11 they are a bunch of bozos who have forked an old codebase, riddle with bugs that core has already fixed and moved on,  and made some trivial changes to it and now they claim they have a dev team! shit, even I can do that!   It's one thing to fork off some code you had nothing to do with and change some parameters. it's another thing to come up with ideas, code them, test them, and test them and test them again before releasing.  Comparing the Core team to the BU_tt-head team team is like comparing NATO forces to the fucking Houthis in Yemen!

@_date: 2017-03-18 02:28:36
Essentially you doubled your coins. If you had 20 btc.... now you have 20 btc and 20 btus. Now... if you tried to send your btu from address  A to address B, that same transaction could be broadcasted on the btc chain and if you don't control address B, you essentially sent your 20 btc and btus to address B.  This replay issue will exist until they can pull their head out of their asses. Don't send any transactions after the fork, if it happens, until things settle down and we'll go from there.

@_date: 2017-03-24 20:41:36
it's very complicated. They could be doing this just to stall everything and collect high fees. 
miners claim that with segwit they won't get fees, since a lot of transactions (majority, hopefully) will go through LN but  if that was actually the case, they can just become a huge LN hub and collect some of that sweet sweet caysh. What they want is control. They want control over the network. Also note that block rewards are going down, which means that they need to rely on high fees to be able to stay in business but they want unlimited block size and cheap fees. that means that they want every transaction on the blockchain. From IoT to my coffee, to huge payments,.. EVERYTHING. that means block-size will be like gigs and gigs. That means only amazon and microsoft and cisco will be able to have nodes. That means bitcoin is donezo!  Bitcoin unlimited is basically E-COIN.  
They only way that bitcoin ( as a decentralized money) can work for all humans of earth, we are going to need Lightning network.  The bitcoin Unlimited is basically Visa with the use of "blockchain Technology"

But the best thing is to get a HD wallet. Hardware wallets are HD wallets. What it means is that you can generate pretty much unlimited addresses using the same seed. The seed is just 12 or 18 or 24 words. (12 is fine! enough entropy) then what you do is you write down the 12 words. Hammer them using letter stamps into a piece of brass! what ever! just keep 12 words safe and make sure no one knows the words! thats all you have to do! much easier than remembering  
here is a website that can generate BIP39 HD wallets. Play around in there. Understand how it works

No lotto is gambling.  Now go away.   Mining is going something  that's really hard and has a reward for doing.  
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:19:14

@_date: 2017-06-29 13:15:20
Looking for a job is gambling.  You don't know if you're going to get it or not and if it pays well enough to cover rent.  Or even how long it might take. All workers are gambling and should get a lisence.  Let me guess. You're a piece of shit waste of carbon lawyer!,? 
@_date: 2016-07-25 20:47:49
I'll give you "this" packages! 
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:10:54
Thank you.

@_date: 2017-07-02 23:33:25
Cool story bro..  Herpa derp mirrors. 


"greater accuracy".  Suuuuuuuuuuuuure buddy.  You have done zero research.  You're parroting what they told you like Toucan Sam when you were a fucking child and you ate it up,  and so did i. But then I grew up and used my brain.  
So clearly you can bounce a laser off the moon with NO NEED FOR MIRRORS.  Get it? Genius?
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:42:43
Pull your head out if his ass 
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:24:07
You'll  double the coins.  Same amount on both chains.  Possibly a 3rd chain.  
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:18:01
Bad analogy Alex.  Queen has the power go disolve parliament.  That bitch has all the power in the world.

Let's agree to disagree on England.  I agree with you on the other thing.  I have one leg in Bitcoin community and one leg in ethereum and I love both. Lots of FUD and blatant lies on both side. Kind of sad.  
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:46:31

Point taken.

Zoom out you monkey. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 01:24:53
It's very elaborate. I can't really explain it on a comment. but it involves things like: when was his last K.O, last time he/she fought, age, style, winning and loosing streaks, and strange ones like when it comes to girls fighting, which one has a man-jaw! lol  There are points for each category, and then you tally them up at the end.
