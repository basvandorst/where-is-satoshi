Then you are more than naive

Neither is btc a good investment
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:59:18
Aint nobody got time for that. It is easier for an altcoin to make the x100 gains than for btc to reach 1M. Those days are gone. Nobody would pay ridiculous amounts for btc
@_date: 2019-07-28 08:34:51
Reach 20k first before fantazising such horrendous numbers
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:56:54
They are not fine they also lost big on btc
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:00:23
Why should it not work again? Do you think btc is the only coin people are interested in investing?
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:56:18
BTC can't give you the x100 returns like some alt's
@_date: 2019-07-23 00:08:13
Btc aint gonna give that x100 returns
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:01:13
So what? Buy when there is blood on the streets. Good luck investing 10k in btc and expecting it to reach 1M lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:31:21
What about the people who went all in at 20k?
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:04:21
Buy when there is blood on the street - anyone??
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:56:45
First of all eat shit you dicksucker second burn in hell
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:02:22
It would be better when btcboys transfer some cash in alts. Btc is an already missed train. There are only little gains to made
@_date: 2019-03-01 21:07:34
I dont trust people who didnt cut their dick off

I never understood stubborn people who are ONLY fixing themselfs on BTC. How can a person be that naive?
Imagine being a newbie, entering the cryptomarket today. You are about to invest 13k to buy one lousy BTC. 13k are a lot of money. Would you really think with your knowledge which you own now, that you can make some really good profit out of it? If you are honest with yourself the answer would be no. 
In my opinion, the only people shitting on altcoins are those who are heavily invested in BTC because they want fresh blood entering the cryptomarket ONLY to buy BTC so they can unload their single btc on them.
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:16:24
HODL?! Anyone?
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:28:28
I know, that was just an example to show the absurdity regarding btc. It does not matter how much of BTC you buy. The profits will always be laughable if you didnt manage to buy btc at a bargain price compared to the profits which you could make out of altcoins if you invest the same amount of money
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:35:23
BTC cant give me the x100 gains anymore. Thats why the altcoins are for get over it
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:57:37
Sure its too late. What do you expect, to get rich with 1 btc? 
If you want some x100 gains, you will need to look for some alt coins with huge potential. 
My personal advise is instead of buying 1btc to diversify in some alts. 
Btc is not the only coin out there

@_date: 2019-12-31 04:15:19
Indeed. I dont believe it will make an impact too. People seem to not care at all like before. The hype train left the station a long time ago.
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:06:42
Try trading btc to aliens. They would rather take the shiny metal gold and not some virtualshit
