I aint woke either but I'm so rope, they call me Mr. Roper When the troubles arise, you know I'm the cool coper.
@_date: 2016-04-23 08:07:42
hah, I'm sure you're pretty woke man - you just don't know it.
@_date: 2016-04-23 07:48:32
Maybe you simply don't hang out with the cool kids?
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:21:09
So was I, is this not the case?
I have a server running 24/7 and wondered if it's worth me running a full node too.
What is the bandwidth usage like once the blockchain is downloaded?
@_date: 2015-12-07 08:39:48
Some great arguments against this system here. Fascinating to read as I had always considered such a system to be pretty good. Shows how dumb I am!
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:23:45
Just top up your supply when spending...wish I remembered to do that.
@_date: 2015-12-10 13:49:02
That's it then, better sell all our btc before it drop to nothing.
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:18:09
But why on earth would they throw anything away? Why not do as you suggest and keep both colors?
EDIT: Also, what exactly is there to throw away since your wealth in bitcoins is accessible  as long as you have your private key?
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:07:50
Right, so if I go to bitaddress, create a new private key (offline obviously) and transfer all my coin to it, I'm in the clear regardless of what happens right?
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:38:42
Why are they even doing this? What possible reason exists?
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:27:13
Phew! I'm back in!
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:17:35
So, can't you make a wallet afterwards and move them then?
I'm not sure I have a full grasp of how this affects people holding coins...
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:22:43
"barf level"? I've never had one of those. Any pizza is good for me, I can honestly say that apart from shitty frozen pizza's they've all been good - even the £5 ones I used to buy as a student. So much cheese, so much grease. Yummy.
@_date: 2015-12-02 08:37:19
Right that's my plan then. I'll move 'em all to an offline wallet and wait for all this to blow over.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:03:13

I can't imagine he will last long unless he holes himself up inside a metal box encased in concrete, buried 50m underground.
He will have a price on his head, set by somebody who lost a lot more money than my measly ~5btc.
Heck, If I happened across him I reckon I would MT his frapp over his stupid fat face.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:40:43
It's because nobody believes you are who you say you are. Surely that's obvious?
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:26:04
What does this mean? Are all goxxed people getting one of these?
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:03:59
As you have so many btc, would you consider bailing out gox?

Same here, I only bought what I could live without...now I no longer have those funds. 
I do _really_ want to buy back in though.
So, I'm selling my ass on the streets tonight - 1btc a pop.
@_date: 2014-11-14 09:24:59
What if the value of bitcoin goes up, you get 'paid' more. That doesn't seem right to me. Yes, I know the actual value you are storing goes up so I guess there's the potential to lose more money...but space requirements don't change, security requirements shouldn't change too much (yes, you could become a target if the amount was huge...but 4000btc is already pretty huge...to me anyway)
Disclaimer: I know nothing of this situation apart from this OP's post so feel free to ignore me.

Interesting. Now, where's my XX bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:40:15
Okay, I did not know that. Cheers for the info.
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:06:10
You really don't know if it's a scam do you? You're making an assumption. They obviously have had problems, this is clear but to say it's a scam is just making stuff up.
There was/is no reason to scam people as they clearly make decent money on fees. Unless they are massively greedy and/or stupid, why would they scam people to make even more money?
I do agree they could be more transparent though but I'm hoping this is to avoid saying something they later regret.
Do I sound like I'm giving them too much credit? Probably. Do I have btc in there? Yes. Is that an explanation for my credit-giving? probably...

Thanks for that. Your words have been confirmed from further reading that I have just done.
Let's just hope that your 'Anarchist Millionaire' doesn't decide to do that I suppose (even if his chances are nearly 0)
Okay, this is all good - I've learnt a lot today thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:50:38
why do you keep posting the same thing?
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:42:00
"You can even make a transaction to spend bitcoin with the online watch only wallet but it will not be signed, it will make an unsigned transaction that will be saved to a file, move this file to the offline wallet, there load it, sign it, save the signed transaction back to the USB, move it back to the online wallet, load it and broadcast it. This way you can spend from the cold wallet without ever having to bring it online."
This is exactly what I was going to ask next, thanks.
@_date: 2014-09-03 07:23:22
Do we have any proof that this even happened?
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:06:22
it does...just tried to register it...gone already.
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:59:39
I didn't write the article...but I was thinking about the possibility before reading it myself.

Nobody believes you dude. Prove it by taking a large dump on your kitchen table and finger-painting the bitcoin logo with it.

@_date: 2014-03-04 16:33:54
ah, okay that makes sense. So apart from trusting your wallet (which you can back up) to a 3rd party would you say that Blockchain.info is nearly as good (or as good) as cold storage?
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:05:48
blimey, I'm at about 3%...and I'm scared about that...then again, I got goxxed...10%.
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:41:36
I'm really intrigued by the idea, you would need some kind of risk/reward feedback mechanism to try and ensure that people kept playing instead of just cashing out. 
I need to think on this more...
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:18:02
Despite the other folk saying it was a stupid and pointless post, I liked it!

@_date: 2014-12-15 23:34:26
Am I missing something or why is that the affected wallet owners log in to the website and fill in a form that BCI can implement to gather any information they require?
...I must be missing something!
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:58:31
doh! stupid me, I should've seen that.
That's cleared that up then.

@_date: 2014-07-11 14:25:37
I've always been a saver myself. But my savings in the bank are losing value everyday. I have savings for short-term emergencies...oriiginally, I was saving for something specific but inflation means that I will probably never reach my desired figure.
So, I keep a small portion of my savings in bitcoin. Maybe it will fair better than my 'real' savings, who knows. It's a risk but one I can live with.
@_date: 2014-07-30 12:24:42
Damn, I missed out :-(
Thanks for letting us in on it anyway.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:27:31
So why not charge a fixed amount in a currency that doesn't fluctuate wildly? Or based on a percentage of the amount being stored?
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:36:14
Quick, some tell Alanis Morissette!
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:35:56

@_date: 2014-02-26 13:47:13
Nobody knows.
My guess is chances are low though.
But that is it - a guess.
Though what is stopping gox saying "we're screwed, it's all gone - sorry"...unless there is a real chance of things turning around?
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:56:23
All those people who came before had their coin in gox...
@_date: 2014-10-09 10:47:13
I'm sure the bearwhale isn't that bothered...they were probably some of the stolen goxcoins!
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:23:22
does that make more sense now?
@_date: 2014-09-17 07:36:22
I dont understand what would motivate somebody to become the 3rd party (arbitor?).
I love the idea of openBazaar so could somebody explain please?
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:22:15
Hang on...I've missed something obviously - are we sure that gox has lost their keys?
I cannot believe that...nobody could be that stupid. Surely?
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:03:24
ah, now I understand.
@_date: 2014-06-13 11:00:38
bet you're feeling happy now though - now it seems to be rising again!
@_date: 2014-08-11 12:23:05
Thanks for that.
I'm no huge mathematician so I guess I should just accept that collisions will not happen but is there not a double checking method available? Perhaps, once it has been created entirely offline, can I not check the existence of that wallet address online?
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:41:01
AHH! EVIL! Thou shalt not speak of The Gox in a positive light!
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:32:33
I'm intrigued - be sure to post back here when you have done something! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:32:18
So, does that mean anybody who uploaded any personal info is basically screwed and in massive danger of identity theft?
Nice. Real nice.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:35:52


Exactly what I thought - knock up a simple form and only make it visible for the affected users.
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:53:18
When looked at it that way, yes it does seem they are talking cobblers. Perhaps this is to make it look like they haven't been ripping people off for ages.

Well, actual _pretend_ mining.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:02:32
that' snot real snuff though is it, just people accidently caught on camera being, erm, snuffed? It was my understanding that the 'real stuff' is when it is done purely for the weird pleasure of the viewer.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:40:36
It's because nobody believes you are who you say you are. Surely that's obvious?

@_date: 2014-03-04 08:37:34
My understanding of compression is that essentially random data is very difficult to compress due to the lack of repeating patterns. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:04:25
Well he's got a smartphone (my old htc hero...slow as hell but runs a wallet okay!), with the Mycelium app on it. I have Mycelium on mine, containing a small amount and every week I throw some coins over to his wallet...though I so ask each week if he wants it in btc or cash.
Obviously he hasn't actually spent any bitcoin yet but this will allow him to now. He's getting a tablet for christmas so it would be great if Android Play store started accepting btc too.
@_date: 2014-09-17 07:58:30
Right! Now I get it, the lure of a financial incentive! Excellent, thank you.
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:48:37
Why was this voted down? Surely this makes perfect sense?
@_date: 2014-02-21 11:18:13
I'm pretty sure I have a brain.
Again: why, if they are making plenty of cash through trading-fees, why would they scam?
Okay, perhaps if they themselves have been scammed/hacked/ripped-off-by-the-feds then they may resort to nefarious activities in order to fix things. That makes sense...I suppose.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:39:23
like I said...I have lost out already and it's depressing as fuck.
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:30:19

oh. nice.
@_date: 2014-04-23 07:34:13
Is that sarcasm?
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:30:05
Hang on...so, so is this actually good news?
@_date: 2014-01-27 09:18:30


Wow, this is true:
...and pointless. Why would anybody want this? I suppose you could fill a Teddy Bear with it and tell everyone it was once worth $10,000. A talking point. Or turn it into a paper-mache Statue of Liberty.
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:42:49
hmmm, doesn't help but still very pretty.
@_date: 2014-08-11 12:43:30
Okay, I think I'm starting to get it now.
So, what's stopping me writing a program that generates millions of wallets with the expressed intention of causing a collision sometime in the future - and then checking these wallets periodically to see if anything has been added to any of them?
Finally, what if I just left my aforementioned wallet-generating-program running continually. Would this have any consequences on bitcoin itself? Or am I still missing the numbers too large to comprehend issue?
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:03:18
Now you're just being silly.
@_date: 2014-12-11 09:29:04
I've been giving my kid pocket money in btc for a while now...now he has something to spend it on!
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:25:06
pretty much just read about it myself.
Fairly annoyed myself actually. Thankfully, I only risked what I could afford to risk.
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:48:10
Wow, cool cheers!
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:02:37

I'm laughing so hard at this.
heh, windows phone...hahaha. This'll keep me laughing 'till christmas!
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:37:12
So, would you use many deterministic wallets or a single 'regular' wallet? And how would _you_ generate your random single wallet? Is bitaddress.org safe enough to use offline? 
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:45:23
I don't know a huge amount about recent games really but as I understand it there are currently games that a player can pay-to-win (I'm sure there are minecraft servers that offer this..doesn't make sense to me but still). So, surely instead of paying the server operator one could pay another player. Of course this throws up the question of who pays for the server but these little problems can be sorted out :-) 
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:48:43
This is interesting.
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:35:33
Minecraft didn't have a story. Imagine paying somebody for all the diamonds that thye have slaved over to find? That might be cool. The rich kids could just buy their stuff, whilst the poorer ones could mine it up!
Hmmm, I like this idea!
@_date: 2014-08-28 07:59:03
Who cares about upvotes?
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:08:52

True. People never do that.

yes, travel if you can. I'm in my late-thirties now with 2 kids and the one thing I regret is not travelling before 'settling down' (though, I plan to travel as much as I can before kicking the bucket...if I can)

I agree that terrorism is probably over-stated. However, do you completely disregard the idea of a huge, well-planned terrorist attack using weapons of 'mass-destruction'?
I think it could happen personally and I would like it not to. Trouble is, I don't like the erosion of freedom that seems to be happening in the name of the evil terrorists.
I'm still in quandary with all this... 
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:24:28
I don't think it's a good idea to indulge in any hoping or expecting. The positivity could easily be crushed. Best just forgetting about it until some actual real news comes.

This is true. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 12:19:26

I agree but I have gone past (not that far!) the required amount for emergencies. I should do something else with the excess...maybe even spend and 'enjoy' it. I'm just not really that materialistic so I don't get off on the idea of blowing loads of cash on stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:01:49
hahah, good answer!
@_date: 2014-03-14 09:19:55
I can't tell if you for or against ebay/pp here but anyway I recently had a 'dispute' with a seller (never recieved item) and ebay practically forced me to accept my money back. I literally sent them an email saying "I don't actually care any more, it was only £4 and 3 months ago - I've moved on" but still I had that 4 quid appear in my paypal account!
So, it's a pretty good service really.
However, I would _love_ to see btc alternative!
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:56:16
I like the watch-only wallet idea, that would make me happier. I have funds on blockchain.info and whilst it's not yet a huge amount, I want to keep adding to it but not have to trust a 3rd party.
I am still reading about Electrum but it sounds ideal to me. Do you happen to know of any drawbacks to Electrum at all? It sounds perfect to me...but I still can't quite wrap my head around how it can possibly generate a brand-new wallet, completely offline and not collide (with 100% certainty) with any existing wallet. Care to explain please?

Well this is certainly a danger. Currently bitcoin is fairly tricky to use and difficult to store safely. Could there be another iteration of it that 'fixes' these problems? Would that replace bitcoin? Or would people's coins move the 'new version'?
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:08:03
...but you gotta speculate to accumulate, right?
@_date: 2014-07-30 11:36:10
Well, please reveal your intentions if you're going to go ahead anyway. Also, if you _can_ go ahead without help, why didn't you just do that anyway?

I never used SR but I reckon if I had or did I would be far too tempted to get hold of some smokable Opium of some kind and that kind of scares me.
I am fully behind SR and it all stands for however and think it's great, it's just that I don't trust myself one bit so I stay far away!
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:44:40
ooh, you're good!
I missed all the obvious ones, blackberry, apple etc. Damn, I fail again.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:08:40
Good point.

Aah kick ass, that's where I've seen here, kind of weird looking really. She is a tad too young!
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:40:50
I held. I'm thankful I did now!
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:10:27
You reckon?
Nah, not me mate. Weapons of mass destruction do actually exist you know. They're called bombs, big bombs, bombs like nuclear bombs. You heard of those ones? Now whether or not the knowledge, ability, raw-materials etc. will end up in the hands of the type of people responsible for 9/11, I do not know but it seems to me that it's a logical conclusion for it to eventually happen.
Disagree? Did you think that before 9/11 it would have been possible for 3 planes to be hijacked by experienced pilots and flown into buildings, all on the same day? I didn't...I didn't think about it much to be fair.
As for being brainwashed, I don't follow the news to any massive degree because I think it's basically propaganda. I don't read anything into conspiracy theories (though I find laughing at them entertaining). On the other hand, I don't believe the Powers That Be are in it for anything other than themselves, apart from a small minority who actually care about their fellow man.
I would seriously be interested in a short discussion on why you think I'm "Brainwashed beyond-belief" and what makes your views any more realistic than my own. Seriously.

It worked for Andy Dufresne.
@_date: 2014-09-30 08:30:35
Yeah, I thought this was rather a strange answer too.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:10:32
You still have to have faith that it will eventually be widely adopted surely? 
Yes it works...but will my mum end up using it?
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:39:40
Why so? I think it makes sense to do loads of testing on a new system. Do you want them to implement something and just go "yeah, probably works - let's make it live!"
I'm guessing you're not a programmer?

aaww, that's really sweet :-)
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:40:17
There's two ways to look at this. If he's simply an idiot who is bad at security and management (which I think could be a possibility) then to have him shot or beaten up is, well, a little bit cruel. However, if it turns out he had anything to do with the losses and he turns out to be criminal the I wholeheartedly am fully behind seeing his head placed in a vice whilst a group a gangsters stand around him watching as his eyes pop out of his head.
(I don't really think that - he's still a human being who is flawed like the rest of us)

They are bastards.

well, whoopy-do for you! I've hardly seen any of the world and it makes me sad to think that I may never see much more than the place I live now (apart from the odd crappy package holiday to palces like Spain).
I want to see jungles, amazing terrain, mountains, hills, trees, rivers, volcanoes, massive cities of the world etc. etc. but instead I have to work 9-5 in order to keep my children fed and warm along with a supply of the latest tat they see advertised on the crappy TV (though saying that, they tend to like good stuff like lego, g1 transformers and computer games...'snot all bad!)
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:33:43
What about some kind of game, where you buy into it for the price of the game and then you trade stuff/tools/weapons etc. in-game and maybe you could steal other peoples stuff?
I guess that's been done before though...
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:48:42
Oh. Pointless then. Sorry, sounds a bit mean that...fairly pointless then.

@_date: 2014-01-17 11:09:03


Err, because World Police?
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:59:10
That means they are trying to keep everyone informed as to what is going on.
So now we know...nothing is going on.
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:38:58
Sorry, can you explain this to me?
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:38:36
Whatever. I have a huge pile of books to read...I assume I can bring those with me?
@_date: 2015-01-16 11:57:40
Proof if proof be need be.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:07:57
And that affects the hash-rate because less miners are mining, yeah?

Shame that most of the population will simply nod their heads in agreement.

Nobody believes you dude. Prove it by taking a large dump on your kitchen table and finger-painting the bitcoin logo with it.
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:47:44
At least you calling him Marie made me smile...so _some_ good has come out of all of this :-/

Surely mining is completely unprofitable right now?

They've admitted that something went wrong their end, they've made a fix, it needs testing. End of story as far as I'm concerned, anything else is speculation.

Just reinstall mycelium on your old device. My son uninstalled and installed on another device, so we reisntalled on the original device and the coins magically came back...which didn't seem entirely secure to me but thankfully it worked.

Shit...let's hope the new owner doesn't try and recover any files on there.
Oh, and why in god's name was I downvoted for my help? You're a strange bunch you redditors.
@_date: 2016-06-02 08:18:59
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:38:59
I think this could happen yes, so the safest option is to only put into bitcoin what you can afford to lose.
That said, I have more savings in bitcoin than I do in the bank.
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:47:56
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for answering!
Not sure why you voated down - it wasn't me!
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:36:06
I wonder why you have so many downvotes for this? Seems to me voat is the ideal place for bitcoiners...me included.
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:49:02
Exactly! Well said!
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:00:35
That's debatable. I still go to the cinema, we have netflix and cable...and my cat might download the odd film here and there. I wouldn't be doing any more buying of movies even if my cat didn't get them for free.
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:40:16
Okay, so if bitcoin is only semi-anonymous then can't we attempt to track where this is coming from and do the guy in?
Please excuse my lack of knowledge on this!
@_date: 2015-07-02 09:00:08
Handwriting too. My kids use friggin ipads to write essays.
@_date: 2015-07-06 11:00:10
Exactly, everything apart from people's labour, skills and knowledge (and obvious tagable stuff like food, water, shelter) is pretty much worthless at this point. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 08:59:02
It's okay, anything that we shoudln't see will be censored.
@_date: 2015-07-08 07:49:42
Who would sue them? The bitcoin CEO?
@_date: 2016-09-06 21:32:07
~Except that if nobody trusts internet banking that will fuck their system right up, so I don't buy it.
@_date: 2016-09-09 12:04:57
Then when you find out who he is, blackmail the fuck out of him for a decent cut of all the profits.
@_date: 2016-09-09 12:02:47


Same goes for having private keys stored at home though isn't it?
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:52:58
and me...and c'mon reddit _might_ be around in 20 years. I mean...erm, slashdot is still around and that has to be a good 15 years old.
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:51:41
what is that?

How come I saw the symbol...on steamOS

if you already have the bitcoin then it's easy. Obviously I'm not  including the process of going through the hassle of getting bitcoin...DURR!
EDIT: missed a word
@_date: 2015-11-19 08:53:42
Hah, well you're rubbish then, our very own David Cameron told us they stopped "no less than 7 terror attacks" this year alone. So there you go, UK! UK! UK!

Don't people get shot for that sort of thing?
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:04:03
Surely an obvious link to the current price change?
@_date: 2015-11-18 16:44:40
Fair point I suppose. Still, my point stands: if you own already then it's infinitely simpler...and more fun.

Back in 'nam we'd call this sorta thing...karma.
@_date: 2015-11-18 14:53:07
Whilst the guy might just be advertising, I can't see why you're disputing the ease of spending bitcoin. It's incredibly simple and simpler than other methods (if you use Mycelium or some app that just reads a QR code). I guess the 'fun factor' will wear off but I love spending bitcoin - makes me feel like a super cool cyberpunk dude from the future.
@_date: 2015-11-18 19:32:54
 hah,I suppose when you put it like that! 
okay then, I concede. It's shit and pointless. Ah well, I still like it. It still makes me happy.
@_date: 2015-11-27 11:27:33
Can I ask why you want to run a full node? Does a computer with such limited power help the network at all? Do you get paid in btc for helping the network? Or is this for making transactions for your own wallet instead of using something like Electrum?
I thought I understood bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:09:09
Is that a valid argument? Honest question, I have no idea. Surely, he's given it away though? Wouldn't Linux Torvalds also fall into the same trap?
@_date: 2015-03-12 11:41:08
Those look tasty!

Hackception? 
...no...forget it...I'll get my coat.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:34:02
If you raise the saturation of the image, invert it and rotate by 90 degrees the private key is there for all to see.
EDIT: but now it's no longer an image. What's that all about?
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:06:53
So, what you're saying is that the closest you're gonna get is circle?
@_date: 2016-05-12 10:59:18
I'll meet you round the back of Tescos. Bring the dough in a suitcase, I'll give you a wallet with the btc on - I'll let you keep the phone.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:21:28


What legal implications? It's not illegal to make a piece of software.

What the hell? Why are you copying my comment? 
@_date: 2015-02-13 08:35:01
Careful what you install though - I assume google does some kind of checking of any apps...random stuff off the internet could do anything to your phone.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:19:21
Hmm, nothing AFACT, maybe a touch of the Alanis Morissette Syndrome maybe?
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:26:38
Is this correct? Surely everybody being a node is the ultimate in decentralization? 
What am I missing here?
@_date: 2016-07-22 10:26:08
How about me what? I'm older at 40...odd. I'm happy with my level of investment with regards to btc. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:24:19
Wrong. As long as you start with 1, you can half a number perfectly every time and never lose any accuracy. What that article is talking about are irrational numbers, numbers that cannot be expressed using two integers i.e. 1/3 is irrational because of the 1.3333333 recurring. Whereas halving is 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16...with the denominator doubling every time...which could obviously go on forever.
@_date: 2016-07-19 07:36:25
I have to say that sounds incredibly risky to me. Depending on how much savings you have, it would seem prudent to spread your risk.
@_date: 2016-07-19 18:27:11
Should've made up a story that you were passing by and saw it.
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:18:15
Yes, it is. Numbers are big, we wouldn't need infinite divisibility anyway...unless the human race never dies out...and bitcoin underpins everything we do...in the end we convert the entire universe into miners,
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:37:47
I can understand how you think it's cringeworthy but I didn't mind it personally. I kind of saw it like how we know that corporations are evil yet we just ignore it and carry on buying their stuff and not really calling them out.
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:09:19
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:55:44
Yes! Yes, I suppose it is!
I jsut think 90% of savings is too much...saying that, I have 33%!
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:11:35


I'm pretty sure the name thing is 'in his head' isn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:43:49
Hahah, that's _exactly_ what I thought - like, does the guy really believe that reddit has that much of an effect on bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:56:45
whhaao. Is that a satire piece? Or was it actually written way back in '95?
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:01:47
how did you know he posted that?
@_date: 2016-07-15 07:25:10
Yes, floating point numbers have a finite number of digits and therefore you can only have numbers with a certain number of digits and that's a hardware limit. If you increase the 'bitage' of the cpu you would, indeed, increase the number of digits available....but you're only kicking the can further down the road like all these things.
However, you can simulate really large ( numbers in software and have accuracy to thousands of digits. The technique allows for incredibly deep zooms into fractals that require the accuracy for instance. 
Basically, bitcoin is infinitely divisible.

I don't really have a lot of 'wealth' to speak of...but I laid down 500GBP on it when it 1btc was worth about 600GBP. I'm not watching the value of my coin twindle. It's quite depressing really but I'm not selling at a loss...I can't bring myself to do it. I did that a couple of times previously and wasn't happy when I saw the price climbing again soon after.
No, it's in there and staying in there I'm afraid. Would anyone consider this foolish?
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:32:06
hahah, oh dear how can anyone get it so wrong!
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:57:51
All your assets belong to us
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:21:10

I reckon I would have to defrost it after travelling over the pond though!
@_date: 2013-12-13 11:01:01
Wow - this sounds fantastic!!!
A great majority of the stuff I buy is from Amazon, so this would be perfect and if it eventually convinces amazon to accept btc then all the better!
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:38:05
Is that a sarcastic, piss-taking laugh or a manic, crazy laugh?
Inquiring minds need to know.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:06:58
Oh yeah, good point...
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:31:30
Fair enough point...but still I hate to see piles of computers in skips. It just seems wrong, all that potential computing being destroyed.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:32:02
The question is: Will there be another Bitcoin or is Bitcoin 'good enough'? Bit coin seems great, it seems to work. you can buy stuff, people can hold coin in order to buy themselves stuff...but is it the best it can be? Could a successor take over in an instant?
I'm thinking of file sharing. Remember when Napster was ace? When _the_ way to share files was Napster? Then came Gnutella, then Limewire and so on and so until bittorrent. It seems to have stopped there really. I know there are alternatives, alternative methods and stuff but basically bittorrent is _the_ way for sharing files.
Why am I talking about this? Because it's all technology, which is exactly what bitcoin is. It's a serious question I am throwing out here: Do you think that bitcoin is _it_? Is it The One? Or will things like litecoin end up being a better bet? Has bitcoin entered into the lexicon of monetary-language? Is bitcoin Napster or is bittorrent?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:40:08

Yes, I have heard the same from many people (on reddit) though my pal IRL leaves a few grand in there...I use 2-factor authentication.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:19:29
But can you buy one with btc?
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:08:10
No. You do not.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:15:57
Ah, that's good news!
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:03:58
I pretty much fully intend to. The only thing I really want to do is move it to an offline wallet so a) I'm not tempted to sell and b) because I think mtgox is dodgy as fook.
(just realised I meant to write "I'm now watching the value of my coin dwindle" - what a duck I am...I mean dick)
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:32:54
This just sounds like "we're losing control of all the money - let's put people off!" to me.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:39:45


Poetic justice!
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:11:20
I would love to go! It's very expensive though.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:31:47
That would also break all online banking.
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:07:20
People throw away perfectly good computers all the time. These need to be passed on to places that don't have 'em. If I was in charge, this would be law. I hate seeing good things go to waste.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:55:16
Do you deliver to the UK!
I want to spend some btc (and I don't use the 'darknet'!)
The options for using btc in the uk are limited it seems.

I don't reckon it will. Sad as that fact is. But I've been using windblows in my 'career' for the last 12 years. Windypants has become so ingrained into businesses minds, nobody is willing to risk their business by choosing anything else.
I think one of the main sticking points is Visual Studio. It's getting shitter IMHO but it's still the best IDE in existence. I know 'real' programmers use emacs or vi and they're obviously "better" but no they're not to the majority of people. 
There's also .NET, which is basically microsoft's version of Java, without all the nice cross-platforminess. It's a great simple language that ANY fool can program in. Sad thing is, even with the great efforts of MONO it's never going to cross-platform so therefore windypanties is never going away.
I hate windows despite the fact that it has helped provide my with an income for so long...but then I hate capitalism too...and money and commercialisation and stuff.
