Traders give liquidity to the market. They are the ones that directly affect the price, and put enough orders on the market that makes possible non-traders to buy or sell the exact moment they want to.
Without traders, two scenarios happens:
1 - there is not enough liquidity (see small cap coins), and it becomes a lot harder to find anyone to buy or sell your coins, wich create a huge volatility/instability on the price. This means that the % of price variation way bigger and happens way faster.
2 - nobody buy or sell the coins (everybody hodl) then the price never change, neither up nor down.
The only problem is: in the cripto economy everybody thinks it's easy to make big money doing day trade.
It is not easy. You need to study a lot, and be ready to lose some money while learning.
While noobs think they can do day trade, the big boys (those who actually learned how to trade) fill their pockets.

You know that for the prices to go up you need the traders right?

Well, as for personal experience, my recommendation is that you transfer to a new wallet as soon as you suspect something might have leaked. 
This kind of happened to me when somebody accessed my web program where I save me notes, and got access to an alt-coin wallet I had and drained it. Wasn't much, but as soon as I found out changed all my passwords and transfered all my other coins to new wallets.
There were very few information in that web program about my Other coins but Better safe than sorry.
