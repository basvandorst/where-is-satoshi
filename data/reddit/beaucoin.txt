Do we need to worry about counterfeitors corrupting the real apps in an "update" and stealing?  Offering illegitimate apps is like your bank inviting a robber to stand in their lobby with a bank name tag on and do your transactions but then walk away with your money.  This failure to screen legitimacy of apps they offer that are then used for theft is criminal.

Wow,  good thing they didn't give up on the Internet when it was getting started.  Have you no faith in people to solve problems as time goes on?  This is still the beginning.  Many, many refinements, mistakes, repairs, will be needed but crypto currency is clearly revolutionary and will in one form or another or more, prevail.  Strap a pair on, and ride on.  Good days/ bad days, yesterday was bad.

Yes let's totally discount their altruism in trying to raise money AND help Bitcoin space.  Did it ever occur to you cynics that there may be people hoping for an explosion in the value of the Alts TO be able to expand their ability to help those in need all over the world?  Typical crowd funding, Red Cross, GoFund me Etc are very inefficient.  Everyone along the way takes a piece so there is much less left for the intended beneficiaries.  Alts should become THE way of funding those in need. I agree with OP. Alt currency folks stepping up in times of severe need helps in more ways than the critics spent the time to consider.

As you are learning, move very small amounts between any locations until you are very comfortable.  As time goes on wallets and storage will get more user friendly.  I use Armory.  Store "carry around" amounts on your phone but keep large amounts offline (a computer that never has and never will connect to the internet).  Back everything up.  Put passwords or wallet rebuilding passwords in a safe or safe deposit box.  Select a couple of people you trust with location of these items in case you get hit by a bus.  Also suggest multi signature storage.  In this type of storage you need to provide more than just one password to move to coin.  Good luck and welcome.  If unsure of this and you want to work with large amounts, hire a consultant to teach you.

Because you can repurchase the BTC to replace it. If you are patient, you can replace the coin at a cheaper price.   Meanwhile, the use of the coin is the necessity of the system which promotes growth of the network and makes all coin that you hold worth more in the long run.  Sure, store some, but spend and replace some too.  Support your local businesses that will take alt and help them connect with transactor a like GoCoin and Bitpay.

Remember the phone wallets are meant to be active wallets. By that I mean carrying cash.  Only use amounts you might normally carry in your real wallet to buy stuff.  Your cold storage should contain most of your coin and intermittently you can move money into your phone wallet.   I don't care if someone else (a responsible vendor) hold the private keys for a wallet that holds essentially $100 worth of btc.  Balances security/convenience.  It's convenient but not extremely secure.  Cold storage right now is very secure but not convenient.

Price is almost always slightly higher on Coinbase for several reasons. Both Circle and Coinbase charge a fee, directly or indirectly, as do all, so they can be profitable.  Only way to buy at best exchange rate is local (especially someone you know) or Sfox which offers multiple exchanges and strategies for purchase.  All have friction and I have used (and continue to use) all of them.  Capitalism reigns and you will nearly always pay a little above the rates you see on common exchanges.   No matter, if the price goes up, you make money, they make money.  Think long term.

Trying to simplify. If you buy before Aug 1 immediately transfer to a wallet you control.  If chain splits you have same amount on both chains.  What happens next depends on technical issues regarding the chain (s). Your only risk is value loss due to instability and fear that may occur.  Don't move coin or transact immediately after August first until "all clear" is announced.  Smart money is on upward move assuming single chain stability after this all goes down.  Otherwise will be a rough ride for Bitcoin.   Only calming thought is that no one,  except short sellers and alt whales, want to see Bitcoin destabilized.

That's why it's great to evangelize, both locally and globally.   Find friends and co workers who travel, especially to places it could become useful.

I spend 30 minutes teaching people in Cayman about it and gave away small amounts for them to play with. I do this everywhere I go and encourage my "Bitcoin ambassadors" to do the same.

After Gox, the value dropped about 80% before turning around.  Similar amount wouldn't surprise me but I also expect when the current scaling issue resolves, one way or the other, there will be a quick turn around .... until the next challenge.  Hopefully time and evolution will bring some maturity to the technology... and some of the leaders.  Currently backing up the truck to load up again.
