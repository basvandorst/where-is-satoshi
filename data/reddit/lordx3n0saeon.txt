I was just recently chatting with a developer who said $2 fees were great, and that even $20 would be fine. I couldn't believe it. 
As for *should*, I mean in that all engineering resources should be spent on this problem. 
I don't get why people are celebrating the recent price when payment is essentially broken at the moment for $1-$50 amounts. $2 fees are absurd.

 But if fees continue to rise (and fees are ultimately needed to conclude interacting via lightning) then hub-and-spoke becomes the equilibrium topology.

It was an option not long ago, and if this trend continues will clearly drive people to other currencies. 
I've held out against switching for a long time, but now I'm definitely considering it.

Sounds like a design flaw. How is anyone ok with this?

This video indicates that LN will result in hubs through 3rd party vendors. 
Which makes sense, because who's going to maintain these trust-chains off network? Someone wanting a cut/centralizing control.
This is fundamentally destroying the entire point of Bitcoin if true.

But can I have an off-chain transaction between myself and any other user without any 3rd party having to act as an intermediary? If so then I don't see a problem. If off-chain means "paypal" like services that settle-up via massive transactions then hell no.
I stand by my point: $2 transactions are *patently absurd*. You should make money on volume, not at the transaction level.

What's with the conspiracy theory? This happened to me when I didn't update my wallet settings and a transaction took *12 hours*. 
I'm not sure how anyone rational thought this was a good design.

One that dynamically changes fees? 
Fees should be in the cents per transaction, and given the current fee level it's just not making sense for my use cases anymore (or honestly anyone that I know). 
I'm glad the price is up, rah-rah and all that jaz. Still doesn't mean I can convince anyone I know to use Bitcoin anytime soon.
