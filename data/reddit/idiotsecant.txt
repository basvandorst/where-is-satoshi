I'm familiar with POS but I don't know what it has to do with the discussion. It's unlikely bitcoin would ever change the underlying chain algorithm. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:30:22
Bitcoin is unlikely to completely stop working in a moment in the type of cataclysmic failure that you're imagining. It is, however, totally possible that it fails inch by inch as the total required energy for the functioning of the network grows outside the bounds of what the market can accept. You're seeing the tip of an ominous iceberg right now with high fees and long transaction times. Bitcoin might solve these issues, or some other coin might, but to assume that bitcoin will keep working because it has worked in the past is naive. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:24:41
If we're looking at bitcoin as tech instead of looking at it as a brand it's even worse. There are a lot of coins that do what bitcoin does better. Bitcoin's major value is that it was first.

Maybe it has issues with encouraging centralization but it seems to me the shift towards a PoS based solution for bitcoin or whatever ends up being dominant is inevitable. The current status quo just isnt maintainable.
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:50:27
I have no doubt. In answer to your question, yes, bitcoin is owned by the JESUITS.

I like it when people simplify complex issues down to 'THE POLITICAL PARTY I DON'T LIKE DID IT' because it lets me know right away that they're an idiot and I don't have to spend any time figuring it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:00:29
You know what else I would argue leads to centralization? Proof of work. Proof of work is just proof of stake with extra steps. In order to get more bitcoin you have to buy expensive ASIC mining equipment. The more you have the more likely you are to be rewarded. How is the actual effect any different? All it does is waste more energy to arrive at the same solution.

I'm not sure what you're responding to... I don't think the article or anyone in the thread made the claim that VISA would be accepting bitcoin as payment. The claim is that bitcoin's transaction rate could exceed the VISA transaction rate. Whether you believe the claim or not, it's not saying what you think it is.

Are you asking me to explain how Shor's algorithm works? 
It's an actual, working process that has been used in physical machines. Scaling qubits up right now is very hard, but it's an engineering problem, not a fundamental physics issue. It *will* happen one day, it's just a question of how long. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:35:30
No, it genuinely isn't. There are examples everywhere of things that were wildly different one time and then returned to stasis later.

Unless you're planning on melting that gold into bullets I don't know what you'd plan to do with either bitcoin or gold in a SHTF scenario. If we fall to the point that the internet and electrical grid fails on a massive scale I'd make the case that we're talking about full scale nuclear war, in which case I think odds are I'm already toast, so why plan for it?

For purposes of this discussion, I'm not using 'operation' in the technical sense of x86-64 (or other instruction set) instructions because these vary from platform to platform. That's why I didn't mention anything about time, TFLOPs, or any other units. This is a comparison between orders of magnitude only. I'm not sure what you're getting at with the ars link, I don't see anyone saying that this is happening in the next 5 years.

I know this is a pointless discussion but how do geostationary satellites work if the earth is a flat disc? There is no such thing as a geostationary orbit around a disc. You can literally build equipment in your garage that can verify the locations of and communicate with geostationary weather satellites like GOES-15.

So either the price of an asset is being controlled by a secret cabal of government conspirators whose only desire is to crush a currency market that provides them total visibility of all transactions or the price is being controlled by market forces. Which one could possibly be true? 
Bitcoin is not going up because the market has decided that it is worth 8kish. That could change over time but that's what's happening here.

Whats 'fair' and whats 'enforceable' might not be the same thing. If China or other emerging economies decide that they want to steal freely available information that the rest of us aren't using because he have a cultural/social understanding that disincentives us from doing so  there is very little we can do to stop it. It quickly becomes a race to the bottom.

You first argument was a moral one: Property that was stolen, regardless of it's current owner, belongs to the original owner. Now that you're considering fiat cash, you're countering your original argument by saying that because it is less convenient the argument doesn't apply to fiat. It looks to me like you're typing to hear the clicking sounds without much thought into what your arguments imply.

Vitalik is a figurehead, I'm not going to say if he wasn't around there would be no price action, because this is crypto, but it wouldn't be a fundamental issue to the continuation of the protocol in a technical sense. djrtwo or karl floersch or other devs are the ones actually writing code. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:40:26
With a regular electronic computer you're looking at something on the order of 2^128 (3.4E38) operations to break SHA256. Using a 2056 qubit quantum computer this is reduced to something on the order of 128^3 operations (2.1E6). A quantum computer would literally be about 1.4E32 *times* more capable than a regular PC for this particular purpose. There are about 2E9-ish computers in the entire world right now, so yes- a single quantum machine with a sufficiently wide bus would be more capable than every other electronic computer together when it comes to this kind of application.

This video is re:re:re:re:re:re:re:fwd:fwd:fwd email material. It has nothing to do with the (admittedly wildly uninformed and counterproductive) NYDFS regulations. The examples in this video are cherry picked for maximum ridiculousness, but even so several of them are valid regulations. Government has a role in making business safer, fairer, and more sustainable through moderate regulation. People that say that regulation is bad full stop are just as bad as bureaucracies that propagate excessive regulation. Like most things in life and politics, if two idiots are arguing the real solution is probably somewhere in the middle.

I don't think you read the article. The employees under this system are paid in CAD, which they then funnel to some kind of bitcoin purchasing agent. Wages are negotiated and paid in CAD, nothing you said is applicable here. It seems silly to me to let my employer buy things to give to me in barter for services, when I might be able to get a better deal myself, but I imagine its a fun thing that people do with a small % of their earnings.

I'm amazed that more people aren't making this point. The TV show Mr Robot, while maybe not the best TV show ever, did paint a pretty accurate picture of where we're headed. Corporate-backed 'stablecoins' are easy to regulate, easy to track, and easy to control. Governments will love them. Real decentralized systems are the opposite of all those things and governments will hate them. It's easy to see which will be viewed more favorably.

Sure, that seems reasonable. Why don't you head over to mainland china and let them know. 
Your rights are not some god-given inherent thing. They are a product of the social contract between you and your government. There is no such expectation in China, therefore no such rights exist.

Tell that to gopher, token ring, and about a zillion other protocols and layers that are no longer used.
BTC absolutely can and will be supplanted if it fails to scale. The amount of people that want to use any crypto right now is very, very small. In a world where that number is very large BTC simply can not handle the tx rate in it's current state. In order for BTC to survive it needs to be usable, if the dev community gets complacent (which is something I see frequently in BTC) a better technological solution will take it's place.

just because a biological system has some property doesn't mean that property was selected for. It can just be a property of the structure of the organ/system/whatever. For example, when most people close their eyes and apply pressure they see remarkably similar very organized patterns. (  That doesn't mean that beyond the conscious realm there is a squiggleverse that can only be reached with a near-eye-squishing experience. It means that when your eyes undergo stress from pressure thats the output they spit out.
