I used to be anti-faucet, but now I think if you are running it properly you can make a tidy sum as well as be responsible to the whole blockchain by not sending too much dust. Put a payout limit, that way tiny dust tx aren't such a pain. If you monetize and SEO properly, I believe you can make a tidy sum of pretty much passive income. then, if you're bored with it, you really do have something valuable to sell. Good luck!

It's crazy how few Bitcoin price apps only calculate the reverse, telling you the cash value of number of btc entered and not the other way around like this one. A really simple idea but much needed if trying to transact in btc for fiat priced items.

I have friends who know the cast of TPB, they all went to NASCAD which is the big art college in Nova Scotia. I'm going to put the idea to them see if it can be heard. The "boys" are also big interactive with their fans. It really would make the Karpeles saga into the farce that it is.

Totally would use. I collect books and must have spent around 4k at abebooks last year.
Only problem I can see is, during early stages, your only vendors will be btc fanatics and therefore the only books available will be old textbooks graphic novels and sci fi fantasy.

Books can be very valuable depending on if they are out of print or not. A lot of people collect them. It's not just the knowledge they contain, they can be incredible works of art and beautiful as objects. You would be surprised what some seemingly worthless old trade paperbacks can be worth. Like I mentioned above, I collect wierd books. Old porn novels from the 60s can fetch a few hundred dollars!

You won't make A profit or even ROI unless you have free electricity and can run it for free for years. 
I have a 60Ghs BFL that I unplugged mid 2014. Can't even give it away. Just a historical curiosity/expensive doorstop/inefficient space heater now 😝
If you want it I'll give it to you for the cost of shipping, but something went wierd with the software right before I shut it down. I didn't bother to try and figure it out. Apparently bfl was re commending users download some different mining software, but it might be fucked for good?

I suggest you take this query over to bitcointalk org. Maybe to the service discussion sub. 
They are a little more serious there, I think it's a great idea!
Be warned though, if you are a new account they will be highly suspicious of you especially if you are looking for funding.
I wholly encourage you to pursue this though. And there are many users at btctalk who are knowledgable in all areas of programming, business management, web based marketing... You get the picture.

Good for you kid! When I was 14 I was primarily concerned with TV and boobies. Got plenty of the former and only dreamed about the latter. Now I have teenagers of my own and I wish they had some initiative like you, but alas, most of us spin our wheels for years until we find our thing, if we are that blessed even. I think you will find a world of adults out there who appreciate your ambition and would be glad to throw support your way. 
Promote your product, put it out there any way you can. Your local paper could even be interested and do a little piece. Believe it or not, a 14 year old who is doing anything beyond playing video games and jerking off is actually newsworthy! I see those stories all the time. It's like; "hey everybody, look! Here's a teenager who isn't a miserable lazy stupid shit! Wow!"
Seriously, good for you, and frankly the Alzheimer's thing you mention could be the real winner here. I'm guessing it's a sort of neuro plasticity trainer, I hope it works out for you, a noble venture!
I wholly encourage you to seek remuneration for your apps, it need not be entirely from download fees. There are companies that do nothing else but help apps get seen and dev's get paid. Agents really. I read about that in an article about the guy who built the Bitcoin billionaire game, he's very happy with his promotional agency.
You might also consider putting ads in the app. I have nothing against it, and there can be good income seeing as they negate the need for app purchase and you will get many more users. I am not sure but you may need to be 18, or get an adult to sign off on it for you, but monetization works. You deserve reward for your work. Always value your talent, and ignore the critics. There's always butthurt cheapskates who expect everything for free, and those are the people who are never generous, with money or in spirit. Fuck them! I'm buying your app right now, keep on coding Brah, you make me smile!
Update- purchased full version, less than a cup of coffee. 😎

That's harsh friend, I feel for you. I've been burglarized before, one feels violated on top of the financial losses. Try not to beat yourself up.
You will have to learn from this experience. Sadly, safes are not very effective, most are lightweight and can be carried away. Also, the mere fact that a safe is there at all lets the thief know you have something worth stealing.
Instead of safe do this; cut hole in drywall close to floor. Put valuables in hole, seal, plaster, paint hole. Goods are secure and no one will ever guess.
For laptop do this; get an old hardcover book that is as large or larger than laptop, remove pages, put cover around laptop, place on bookshelf. Crooks don't care about books most probably can't read.
I'm sorry for your loss bro, I've been there. Never going back now though 😜

If BTC plateaus it will only take you about a year &amp; 1/2 to have one BTC. 
If it continues like the last few months... you'll still have some bits. 
It's a solid plan. Come back here with regular updates. I'm preparing to quit smoking myself very soon. I may join you in BTC &gt; Cigarettes challenge.

they're pretty cool. 
it will be great to disseminate bitcoin to my art-geek friends.
so far they've only looked at btc with skepticism when i try to discuss. They know about btc and blockchains, but they arent really interested. They are artists, not fintech guys, there isn't enough creative potential in the idea of btc alone to inspire. However, they all are grubbing for $ all the time. Most of them deal with CARFAC which is like a Canadian Artist's "Union" 
  
CARFAC purports to do the same thing manually and via copyright fees collections. its bullshit really and doesn't work very well. it exists mainly as a sort of regulatory agency- they set the pricing standards that correspond to disciplines covered in our Canada Council Grants Program, meaning; If I can claim 750$ for one performance in a funded gallery, both me and the gallery file claim for the same amount and we each get half as much as we asked for when we apply for funding. Its bureaucratic inanity and its basically "welfare for artists". 
They barely even hand out a pittance and Ive still had to "talk friends off the ledge" when their applications get refused. Actually the blockchain could do wonders for the grants application and awards process. now that i think of it.
anyway. i know quite a few digital artists there's a few collectives even, these guys are pretty cool.  
they will pounce on this shit! 
ok- sorry to write a novel over here, but I'm going to see a big show on may 1st  so I'm excited to have a good btc sales pitch that might actually garner some interest from these non-btc people I know . new adopters!

@_date: 2015-04-24 11:51:22
That's so great. I had never considered the verification by blockchain aspect. It is so hard to give digital art proper provenance that it makes it very difficult to sell. Usually it gets sold via some hard copy like DVD, I've even seen usb drives sold loaded with art, but it is still so easy to copy. Limiting editions, and thus protecting a work's valuation has been a problem as long as digital art has existed. This could really catch on big. How exactly does the artist verify that those are the only authentic copies? As an artist myself I would like to know the specifics.

Crypto itself is not banned, you can own it, but using it for transactions like you would normally use fiat or CC is illegal.
But it’s kind of like censorship is here. Officially porn, depictions of drug use, anything going against traditional values... anything critical of the govt and any version of history that isn’t the official party version.... all that stuff is technically illegal but now that everyone has the internet there isn’t much they can’t see.
There’s facebook groups for crypto trading and at least one online exchange... but stuff like coinbase is limited... you can trade crypto to crypto but you can’t buy crypto with $$$.
It will change eventually I’m pretty sure... there’s a casino in my town where you can gamble with BTC... I haven’t been in but I suppose you could just buy BTC there and take it home if you wanted... they probably charge a premium though
@_date: 2017-05-07 11:54:19
I believe in the blockchain, don't get me wrong, it's just not really found it's real world application yet. The thing that it offers and can't be had anyway else and is thus universally adopted.
We know crypto can do so many things, but people still won't adopt. Why? Maybe it's just too early yet? I mean if BTC magically replaced fiat overnight people would learn how to use it and how to protect their stash and exchanges would be obsolete. That's what I'd like to see. Total user autonomy. I'm afraid the banks will be there first, figuring out how to manipulate the situation to where users are dependant on 3rd parties to operate. It's kinda what they do.
If people could just wake up and see how banks could be done, just like that, and how that would improve things... sadly the opportunity for gains in a volatile market seem to be the biggest attraction 
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:35:41
this has been the argument all along (at least since 2012 when I got involved) 
As long as there are exchanges needed, in a world where you can't use crypto at every instance where you would use fiat, BTC will never have any true intrinsic value. It will only be worth what people will pay for it, which looks good right now, but can't last. 
If I can pay my rent, my bills, my groceries. If I can find my business entirely with BTC even paying my employees than it might fly. Right now it's just an instrument for financial speculation.

The ad just emphasizes the volatility of BTC which is not good PR.
I bought brunch for my wife and daughter in 2012 with BTC, mainly for the novelty but also because BTC was just hanging ~$100 and I was bored/unsure if it was going to do anything... that brunch is worth close to $1000 now and I'm not ok with that. 
If BTC ever finds an actual real world use that people use daily, besides as an investment product, we might see stability, but until then it isn't worth spending. On anything. Ever. HODL!
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:33:38
true, the tech side is pretty good, and there are some users who remain astute all 'round. The overall quality has sunk a bit since I joined in 2012. I spend a lot of time reporting sock-puppets and the guys who are obviously just trying to improve their rankings to make more money on sig campaigns.
overall, btctalk is still the only game in town really.

Roger Ver talks about this, mentions it in this month's Details Mag Story. It started with the crypto logical and economic ideas of satoshi, reacting to the great financial recession of 2008, quickly appealed to the high-minded ideals of the anarchists and libertarians, soon after was noticed by the get-rich-quick brigade, and now the big players are warming up. It is a necessary cycle.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:48:19
in a perfect world, yes. 
the cynical view is that, in the future, even with full adoption of crypto, it will be just as it is today; the very few possess the lion's share of the wealth, the rest have very little.
luxury communism would be great, but when i look at the USA right now, with their rising oligarchy, i dont hold much faith for any thye of economic utopia for a long time, crypto adoption or not.
just my view, i am a disappointed idealist.
mostly, my original comment was about the problems facing crypto seeing mass adoption. i didnt even mention security. stolen crypto is really prohibitive to new adopters. ive heard every argument about how one must take responsibility etc etc etc, but every new user who loses coins to a hack is more likely than not to walk away for good. its a big problem.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:21:08
Hehe, so true OP.
When I first got into BTC it was due to the fact I had received a small inheritance. It wasn't a huge amount, but it wasn't insignificant either. Basically, it was enough to make me rich if i invested it wisely.
It was also enough that my bank phoned me up and invited me to come down and "Talk about investments" hmmmmmm.
Anyways, I had already learned about BTC and had been watching for over a year so I was decided. Still I went down to the bank. The douche I met there had a fuckin' signed picture of Donald Trump on his desk, and kept looking at his Rolex conspicuously, all the while talking like an asshole about their excellently performing mutual funds RRSP GIC etc etc etc.
I said "thanks but no thanks, buddy, but I've already decided to sink a healthy percent of my funds into BTC."
The douche snickered and laughed, shaking his head. That was January 2012.
