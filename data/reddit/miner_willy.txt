I'm seeing the issue of protecting the locally-stored LN state as directly analagous to protecting the on-chain, but locally-stored, wallet: it is ultimately for the user (owner of wallet and either end of the channel) to protect his data, and the devs have very limited ability to help. That is, your implicit quesion "...If my computer crashes, all of my funds since the last blockchain commit (channel close) are lost." can be generalised to one of backing-up, rather than requiring a specifically crypto facility.
Let me try a different tack. I would expect a layered effort from all parties concerned. The LN devs could, at the very least, never change an existing file, but copy a file in from disk, update it, then save back out under a new name, then relink to that new file. However, one cannot guarantee that a saved file is protected - it could have gone to a ramdisk. The user must do the rest of the work: providing an OS that can properly version files, that can do change notifications and so initiate rsync copying off-drive, for example. Even then, the user would be responsible for ensuring the off-drive location is appropriate (a memory stick is a poor idea etc) and that the restoration processes are known, practiced and effective.

There are two sources. If you successfully find a block you get a. The block reward itself, currently 12.5btc and b. The total of all transaction fees associated with the transactions in your block - and this can range from 0btc (in empty blocks) up - averaging around 4btc per block if my maths is right.
The $3.80 figure is an average over some considerable time, and you can expect that average to fall as the difficulty rises. This is far less than the $200k above because you’re part of a pool who share costs and so, rewards.

That'd be a bad idea: the update would have to come from someone who had the previous keys, usually the guy stolen from.
So a bad actor would buy a covfefe with 1 BTC and once out of the shop would report his coins stolen. Now he has the covfefe AND his 1 BTC back.
I could see room for a second layer solution: GubmintCo could accept stolen coin reports and note them, now exchanges can make a reputation point about honouring GubmintCo reports. Not sure who'd pay for that, though.

Nothing went wrong: you traded low fees against ownership of your bitcoins.

This is either poorly worded or not true.
A computer crash is usually followed by a reboot, so is a temporary condition. This is indistinguishable from an network timeout so the node could be expected to pick up from where it left off.
Having a computer /trash/ is a permanent condition necessitating flatten and reinstall. At that point state is restored from backups. Any node not running backups deserves to lose something.
It’s 2018. Backups have been A Thing in computing for over 50 years now.

There are two new issues, one known as Meltdown, the second as Spectre (note British spelling.) In both cases malware could potentially obtain passwords known to the computer running it. Malware has to get on the computer first, though. 2FA makes it substantially harder to make use of these passwords, although you should absolutely be using 2FA anyway.
If the malware is on an exchange’s server - and I saw reference elsewhere that getting the malware into an AWS instance on the same physical machine could override 2FA - then there’ll be a shitstorm. One would hope they’re not using AWS for important processes or opening email attachments on their server though.

There's great evidence for that, but is it the whole story? I'm thinking there's more. 
First, what the market has decided changes over time. What was bitcoin before it could be bought? Perhaps it would be fairer to call it a novelty than a speculative asset. 
Second, what the market is speculating on may not actually be a financial value: From 2014 to 2015 it fell steadily from c$1000 to c$200 yet people still transacted in it. Perhaps the market was now speculating not on the fiat value, but on the technology.
Third, there's evidence of bitcoin meeting all three functions of money. It's used as a currency, strictly as a medium of exchange: behold the real estate, goods and services being bought and sold in bitcoin. There's similar evidence it's being used as a store of value. I see very early evidence of it being used as a unit of account too: many alt traders keep their records in BTC, regarding a successful period as one in which their BTC goes up, not one where the fiat value of the BTC goes up. 
Fourth, there's evidence of it being a public good in bringing a new common understanding of what's possible with the exchange of value: Venezuela and Zimbabwe most clearly show - the ruled are less bound by the ruled.
Fifth, there's early evidence of a bitcoin-based economy where it's not just people buying in and out at the edges, but transacting in bitcoin among themselves. 
So the market has decided bitcoin is not just a speculative asset, but it's also a money, a public good. 
I'm betting that "currency" will be redefined by younger economists to include what bitcoin is and will be. Older economists with their instance bitcoin doesn't meet their definition of currency will die off, left behind by a world that never needed them to gatekeep "what currency is for"

If the price is in bitcoin, ie BTC-21,000,001, you cannot buy it because there'll never be enough of them. So whoever is selling is not really trying to sell it.
It the price is in USD (or other fiat) which right now means USD-180,789,232,576, but delivered in BTC, then you'll have to buy bitcoins to get the amount. As you buy, the price of each bitcoin goes up because you want so many. Let's say that once you buy half of all the bitcoins the price has doubled. That means you can now pay the original dollar bill in bitcoins.

Yes. It's very like a bail bond - you commit $1000 to the court to stay of out jail until your court date, and if you don't turn up, the court keeps your money.
Same with LN: in order to receive 1BTC, you must commit 1BTC so if Lightning discovers you're a bad guy, you lose the 1BTC you committed. 
If you need to receive 1BTC and you have no funds, then you should receive it over the blockchain proper, not LN.

Welcome, fellow oldster! You and I are clearly in the same chapter if not on the same page.


This para seems wrong. People who were using bitcoin to get around currency controls to buy USD in the West are unlikely to have been hurt by the 40% drop: surely the purchase of bitcoin in Yuan, the transfer to Western family, and the sale back into USD is a matter of minutes, not the week it took for the 40% to unroll. Thus, anyone hurt by the 40% drop was not looking (or not *just* looking) to get around currency controls. I do take the point that the bitcoin black market is as nothing relative to the USD black market.

This is where this economist's argument comes off the rails. Bitcoin as a technology does not exclude the possibility of 3rd parties offering fractional reserve bitcoin ownership, and has nothing to say about people of their own free will choosing to buy into that. I can think of use cases where they may want to.
Importantly, it is non-exclusionary: just become some part of the ecosystem involves fractional reserve ownership doesn't in any way inhibit that part of the ecosystem that does not. Contrast this with the Dollar which *is* exclusionary - there's no choice about whether people engage with the fractional reserve dollar.
Thus, the boom and bust Ivan is worried about is tempered by affecting only one side of the ecosystem. Indeed, probably only affecting the fractional reserve companies. They can enjoy the chaos, the rest of us will rubberneck as we pass by

Got it. It used to be that a wallet would create the 100 next keys in advance such that a backup could restore funds not only to the date of drive failure, but also restore funds for the 100 transactions following the drive failure. It would be trivial to set that number to 10,000 if desired.
I seem to recall an effort to make all possible future keys calculable given any wallet backup but can’t find reference to it right now.

With 100% of the hashpower the attacker can go back and say "You know what? The last six blocks are wrong! I just mined these seven blocks" and because he has the longer chain, other participants will accept it as true, thus rewriting the end of the blockchain.

In theory, if 50% of the hashpower vanishes just before a difficulty adjustment then it'll take twice as long to mine the next 2016 blocks - and only at that point does the difficulty dramatically reduce: I think by half. 
Your scenario requires the Bad Guys to wait at least four weeks to conduct their attack, during which time everyone will realise what's going on as the 2016 blocks are taking consistently twenty minutes to mine. They have to wait four weeks because the hashpower that's left will take that long to do the mining before the dramatic difficulty drop.
In those four weeks you can expect, among other things, that marginal miners, who had only recently dropped out because mining was no longer worth it, would return to the fray: they are now twice as likely to mine as they were before. You can also expect some of the Bad Guys to keep mining for a different pool -- because who wants to miss out half their income for over a month?

If they enforced only they could be miners, who cares? As miners they can only further secure the blockchain, or waste their efforts securing an alt.    
If they all banned mining outright, the first to break ranks would make outsize returns mining. The others would have to follow suit or get left behind.

Are you able to explain how an airplane engine works? If not, how do you seriously expect anyone to adopt airliners as a form of travel?
The answer is that the patience of adherents has no bearing on the usefulness of the tech; people will adopt crypto because it solves their problems, not because they understand it. It therefore follows that crypto will progress quite happily - for now - leaving educating the masses until much later.

I'm trying to think of a single instance of global nations successfully centralizing any legal power whatsoever under a single authority, but I'm coming up short. However, let's play the scenario out as if it could happen.
The particular blockchain they authorise would immediately plummet in value vs bitcoin as actors expected this 'Govchain' to devalue over time as fiat has done. This would create a flight to safer assets, which would include bitcoin. That increases the price for btc, which further encourages others still to fly to it. With the price increasing, miners are motivated to join/rejoin pools in order to obtain the block rewards thereby. To them it's a simple balance: block reward vs risk of capture. In many countries, risk of capture is exceedingly low -- if you know the right people. End result: mining has slowed, not stopped, and the price has gone up. Govchain, if we are to assume that it's global, will not work for every country as the world is not an [Optimal Currency Area]( which encourages adhering nations to break away from it. However if we assume Govchains are per nation, just like fiat is today, then there is no difference between the situation we have today and needing "the government's permission" - and bitcoin's doing fine.

Thanks for working through this conversation with me - I do actually appreciate it!
You're arguing that a lender would not lend the 200BTC given an even expectation the house would be worth about 25BTC in 40 years time, which is true. A reasonable social response to this is fewer loans and more direct transfers such as with dowries, capital gifts etc. Dad, who didn't lend his 200BTC out 40 years ago, can afford to buy *outright* a house for each of his four children and still have half of his purchasing power left over. In the meantime he has lost not a penny to interest payments that return him and his family nothing.
I suspect that your argument (along with many other of the more thoughtful arguments against Bitcoin) introduces a debt-based scenario to a non-debt-based economy and attempts to demonstrate that because it doesn't seem to work ("no-one would lend"), that's a flaw of the non-debt-based economy. I suggest that it's a faulty assumption on your and their part: that a non-debt-based economy would necessarily see much the same debt-based activity.


No serious commentator has said Bitcoin would be a world currency, because to do so is to completely miss that Bitcoin is utterly optional. People want to stick with debt? They can go right ahead. Unlike the dollar, Bitcoin makes no demands on those who do not want to use it.
I suggest that "debt-based" is one of several ways an economy can be organized, and represents a local equilibrium. My *suspicion* remains that Bitcoin represents another local equilibrium. Time will tell.

It allows for consensus to be reached in the presence of vast legions of bad actors; it allows that those bad actors can be effectively punished by the majority; and it allows that those bad actors - to succeed - must be continually bad and continually the majority off into the future.
As to what it allows - it allows micropayment, and so, microfines. That allows for effective gatekeeping of online resources. For example: you could be asked to pay 10 sats to access a forum. You could also be given your 10 sats back if you visit the forum and don't troll. So: what online resources could benefit from this?

Your question is based in geography, alas. Bitcoin doesn't "do" geography, but here's a guess!
Generally: Rather than a particular city, consider Bitcoin will be more a creature of *all* those cities (and others) rather than their respective hinterlands, much less their nations. Bitcoiners of San Jose, London, Tokyo have more in common with Bitcoiners in other cities, than they necessarily do with their next door neighbour. That said, a city with a clearer engagement with Bitcoin will outcompete cities that lag.
Mining: You may find the activity of mining gains local centers, based around cheaper/free-er electricity.
Education of developers: The centre would tend to be in the West because Eastern education seems to have reduced emphasis on pointing out the professorial flaws, whereas the West has more a culture of kicking over his desk.

I interpret that to read that if you agree a 5% limit and the exchange rate (er) goes up 20%, you get 5 and they get 15. If the er goes up 5%, they get nothing. If the er doesn't move, you get nothing in addition to what you deposited. If it falls 20%, you wear the entire 20%, just as now. With a deflating currency, this does look like a sustainable model to me.

I'm halfway through that video, and enjoying it. The other half will have to wait for tomorrow now, but let me add a couple more things for you.
Consider [this scene]( starring Danny DeVito in "Other People's Money" from 1991 (yup, 23yrs ago). Consider what he says in that restaurant: "They want to run the world, they got no bread". Who's "they"? He's talking about *the Japanese*. Back then (I was there!) *everybody* knew that the Japanese were going to take over the world. 5 years ago, *everybody* knew it would be the Chinese (some still do.) This is a long way to say: consider that experts are very, very frequently wrong. Not because the Japanese wouldn't take over, but that Japan couldn't match Western productivity where it counts. We overtook their events. Hyperinflation - the dollar crash - may be coming, or it might not (don't underestimate the desire to defend the dollar), but it's one of many scenarios, and we might not even notice it if it's overtaken by other events.

A lender is not going to lend you 200BTC over 20 years because - even at moderate deflation - at the end of it your house would be worth 100BTC. He could just keep his money.
So he does. He's called you, and you keep your 200BTC now, and then in 20 years you can use 100BTC to buy your kid a house. Your kid doesn't have to borrow money, neither of you spend money on interest, and he gets to save his money towards your grandkids buying a place. Win-Win.

One of the frauds paypal (and banks) protect against is unauthorized purchase. If someone else buys stuff on your account, you can have that reversed. So if someone cracks your machine, buy bitcoin on your paypal account, and then forward it from the registered address to their own, you as the account holder would be covered.

A security flaw that takes down Bitcoin is very likely to take all the alts along with it. More minor flaws are expected to allow enough time for development of a countermeasure before an exploit is available.

Except you cannot use it without restriction. You have a daily ATM limit of £500 max, you have an over-the-counter limit somewhat higher, you have a restriction of around £6,000 before your purchases are referred to, IIRC, the FSA.

This is a variant of the question "In order to send $X to Y, why would I want to sell fiat, buy bitcoins, send bitcoins to a recipient who then sells those bitcoins and buys fiat?" favoured by those like Krugman. 
Both questions are crafted to imply that Bitcoin is only a mechanism to transfer value from one fiat point to another, not an economy in its own right.
What if the printer is only available in Bitcoin? Then OP would be directly advantaged. What if OP cannot send fiat values  (see Argentina, Cyprus, etc; also lack of banking access)? Then OP is directly advantaged. What if OP has bitcoins but finds he doesn't own enough fiat? Then OP is directly advantaged. What if OP - for whatever reason - wishes to encourage the Bitcoin economy? Then OP is directly advantaged.

Most people would do this. Not necessarily because they're dumb, too. 
Rather than extend your example further, how about cutting to the chase? What you're suggesting would end up as an escrow system. Seller (S) and Buyer (B) agree terms; B sends bitcoin to escrow account at Bank; S sees B has funded the purchase and sends the purchase; (magic reporting of delivery;) Bank funds S from the escrow account. 
If S misbehaves, this could be dealt with outside of the Bitcoin system because it's unquestioned that B sent the payment. If B misbehaves, S could handle it as a fraudulent purchase outside the Bitcoin system too, refusing to refund or giving it to his bank to handle as usual.

I think you're looking at Blockchain.info's own database of notes, not notes stored in the blockchain itself. No blockchain.info, no notes.

As he's interested in capturing that right, rather than physical notes, that changes the nature of attack from finding and laying hands on the value, to inducing Carol to hand over the wallet.

No: You would declare it as a cost before calculating the profit. "I spent £1000 buying hardware, I earned £1200 from it, the taxable profit is therefore £200."
I'm less sure about the "earned" bit for which you'd seek proper advice, but AIUI you only "earned" the £1200 if you have "realised" that £1200. That is, if your equipment generated £1200 of BTC but you've spent none of it, it is unrealised, and so not taxable. You only have the loss. However, if you turn half of your BTC into £600, you "realised" that £600 on the day you did the trade. If you bought £600 worth of VPN *with the BTC*, you still "realised" that £600 profit on the day, even if you paid BTC. It gets even gnarlier if you bought the VPN in dollar terms, and gnarlier still if you paid in BTC only, not any other currency.

You are unlikely to see bitcoin mortgages. Problem ... solution:
Problem: with deflating money, a bank lending you 200BTC for a house now will find in 20 years that your house is ~~only worth~~ costs 100BTC. They might as well keep the 200BTC!
Solution: as saving is now rewarded, you are more likely to have your house bought you by your parents, and more likely to buy property yourself for your kids. In dollars, your $200k house might cost $700k in interest payments and others - you've lost $500k on the deal. Using savings, you keep that $500k.

I might be wrong (and I'll be sharply reminded of that if so) but that's not how it works. There are two ways:
More popularly, a message has its *hash* computed, and that *hash* is stored in the blockchain. Thus, I can prove that a specific message (picture, audio track etc) existed at a particular time because A: here's the message, B: here's the hash of the message today, C: here's the hash in the blockchain and D: that hash was time stamped Nov 2011, thus, my message existed in Nov 2011. Hashes cannot be searched for the words that went into the hash. Storing large messages in the blockchain would make the blockchain files humungously large.
Less popularly, extremely short messages (in the order of a dozen characters) *could* be stored in the blockchain by creating a hash that just so happens to match that message, either because the message only contains A-F, or uses 'l33t-speke' numbers and letters A-F, or encodes ascii into its hex equivalent ('brucefenton' encodes to '627275636566656e746f6e'). One could conceivably write software to scan for these, but I'm not aware of any.

Oh, ok. Had me confused there.
Two responses to that. First, people don't have to use Bitcoin, they're perfectly entitled to work for 20 years paying rent in dollars while saving in bitcoins. At moderate deflation, the purchasing power of their savings increases over that time without need for exposure to risk or seizure. Of course, they could also save in dollars by buying SPDR if they think that's where their best interest lies. Either way, a very significant part of a house purchase can be provided for.
Second, if you're making a more general point that many people don't have enough left over that they can save, I'd agree with you. Part of that reason is the debt they're getting into with college loans, etc; part of the reason is many public policies deliberately punish savers, and many more again of them just don't know how. Bitcoin helps move us away from a debt-based system, even if it can't put fuel in everyone's car on day 1.

FTA: "A sophisticated attacker would only have to subvert a handful of different standardized setups to compromise the network."
In context, article is talking about one particular ASIC being 45% of GHASH.io's market. Subvert its manufacturer, and an attacker could compromise the market. 
Miner_Willy judges this assertion "false", for the following reasons.
1. The ASIC manufacturer could carry out this attack just once, because no-one would ever buy from them, or any of their officers,  ever again. 
2. The attack would be not be a 51% attack. 51% attacks allow a certain kind of naughtiness but as compromising the whole network requires them to get *and maintain* 51% of the network, how could they force miners to use their tainted ASICs? How could they even keep their existing 51% in place, undetected? 
3. The attack would therefore be short in nature. They could send all block rewards back to homebase instead of the owner. Time until suspicion: 1 block. Time until realization: 1 hour. Time until their ASICs are turned off: 1 hour and 1 second. Max reward from attack: 150BTC.

If bitcoins replaced all the money everywhere in the world, a single satoshi would still only be worth about 2p, in the UK. As the protocol allows for additional decimal places to be added if necessary, and a 'Satoshi' is used for the smallest possible denomination, I would expect the name to be changed in future.

You've made a very common mistake.
Implicit in your question is that there is an "event" after which Bitcoin is "crushed". This is not true. This is not a war with an epic final battle, this is not a film where the chase scene is suddenly over. 
In order to crush Bitcoin, those resources have to be continually implemented, Bitcoin would have to be continually crushed, because as soon as the crushing stops, it pops back up. Those resources have to be increased arithmetically, every two weeks, far, far into the future.
You've made a second very common mistake: that every dev, everywhere in the world, would just roll over and play dead rather than counter the attack. 
So, your answer is "No". The US could spend 100 billion a month to crush Bitcoin but would bankrupt itself first.

If it was backed by bitcoins, it would be redeemable for bitcoins. 
If there was no faith in that government's integrity, the paper money would be redeemed for bitcoins very quickly, and if they had issued more than they owned (fractional reserve) the price would shoot up as they needed to buy what they said they owned, but didn't.
If there was faith in their integrity, the same thing would happen but very slightly slower.

@_date: 2014-12-16 18:54:24
The reason you can't find the answer is because there isn't one; Bitcoin cannot be effectively banned - it can only be slowed as described.
A total ban could not happen, as it must necessarily require the possession of wallets to be banned, and some wallets exist solely in the holder's memory. It would require the import or export of bitcoins or goods and services bought with them to be prohibited, but how many FedEx parcels get stamped "bought with cash"? Thus, whatever ban could be in place must be partial, and less effective for it.
Governments could ban Bitcoin related trade of all sorts. The Soviet Union banned the possession of dollars, and thus trade within the country using dollars (with exceptions.) Did it help? Arguably, it made matters worse.
Governments could ban Bitcoin paraphernalia: paper wallet? 6 months prison. Waiting for mining equipment? They'll check the difficulty daily then let you out the day after your equipment is obsolete. Paraphernalia means checking out your phone, effects and address at every police interaction. That would seem to teach people not to call the police for other matters, but logic is not their strong point, eh.
Governments could ban Bitcoin traffic: syncing blockchains, visits to BTCe, downloads from proscribed github pages. This would be beyond daft though - there is no technical means to achieve the above that won't be circvumvented inside minutes. Deep packet inspection? Go to HTTPS. Github ban? Github Sweden instead. 
Many of those who most misunderstand Bitcoin think that there's a kill switch the Government can pull, but none will point it out. Don't like an enemy? Send in the army. Don't like people reading books? Put them in a pile and burn them. Don't like Bitcoin? Boy-doody are they out of luck.
Assuming there IS a kill switch that can be used to turn off Bitcoin in a territory, whether military, legal, technical or whatever, things would still not be effectively banned: those jurisdictions without the ban would see people migrate to them, trade migrate to them, wealth migrate to them. Ability to change others in the world is based on the size of your internal market; the larger the Bitcoin market is, the less desirable it is to outlaw it, never mind working out how.

One of the inbuilt advantages of the US is the strong division of powers given to Government there.

Central Government can and does make local law in the UK. Federal Government in the US, cannot.

2, 3 or all the manufacturers make no difference: the logical response of the miners will be to downgrade to the previous best equipment: FPGA, for instance. There would be no equipment online to conduct the DDoS, so no network compromise there.


It still takes time, and even if successful, it pushes the mining equipment required further and further backwards. First, FPGAs (which more people can use), then GPUs (how to hack all these people with high end cards?) then even CPUs (how to hack everyone, everywhere?!) The cost to reward of "hacking everything" is too high.

\1a You're misunderstanding addresses. Addresses are - for most people - only used once. So in most cases, you can only tell that a particular address was only used for the particular transaction you're engaged in. This is identical to a physical wallet: as a storekeeper I might know now that you use a wallet with "Bad Mofo" written on it, but I've no idea how you got notes into it (ATM? Bank clerk? Robbery?)
\1b. You're misunderstanding the public record. The blockchain traces the history of a particular coin, not the person. Whose to say that 100BTC came from your employer, or your savings account, your grandmother? Not the blockchain.
\2. You're misunderstanding the 51% attack. In particular, you seem not to realize the 51% as an attack doesn't have to happen at a particular point in time to "destroy Bitcoin". It has to start, and continue, and continue ... and continue. To "destroy Bitcoin" you'd have to have *and then maintain* more than 51% of the network for days, weeks, months.

I don't think we'll see heists in the same way, as there's no obvious distinction between the QR code of 0.0001 BTC and of 1,000,000 BTC in the same way that you *know* when that truck is loaded, and when it's not. (Clue: look how low the suspension has gone.)
Rather, I suspect we'll see more blackmail and extortion than burgulary and robbery. The right to bitcoins (because that's what the QR code is) cannot be time-locked in a vault, so it makes criminal sense to induce the owner to hand that right over. This speaks to kidnapping and ransom as more effective.
But how will the bad guy know? Because of a guy at the IRS who notices how in the Blockchain you paid capital gains from an address with a hundred times the spent value.

It shouldn't affect Bitcoin, at least directly. 
If you imagine a world where internet traffic travels either at full speed or 5% of full speed, with nothing inbetween, you can be sure 5% rated traffic would be found a way to pretend to be full speed traffic. Encryption, port-shifting, port-knocking ... all these things would add up to hiding from the transports what's in the packets.
We don't live in such a world. So I'd expect instead to see a range of responses from different communities. Some small size ISPs may charge more and guarantee neutrality in the guise of "**we** don't buffer your access to facebook videos" etc. Some large size ISPs may charge less as long as you don't stream in the evening, etc.
Bitcoin traffic is next to nothing, after any blockchain download, so they're unlikely to put any money into something with basically nil reward.

As operators give up, the networking hashing rate falls. With that rate down, it becomes profitable to mine again, and the rate rises. 
As the number of operators falls, the miners should be dominated by those with cheaper electricity (however large they are) as well as those with more uptodate equipment rather than simply 'big-time' miners. 
I don't expect transactions to slow unacceptably. They should slow - at least until the hash rate falls to reflect that - but were it to slow "unacceptably" I think we can expect the mining community to make a change.

It is convincing, however (and I'm playing devils advocate here) none of those 29 that hyperinflated had a position as a reserve currency. It's reasonable to suggest that hyperinflation could occur because there were other currencies to flee to, so if the dollar is the global reserve currency, there are none to flee to, and makes a tourniquet stopping flight and therefore stopping hyperinflation. 
I said "If" the dollar is a reserve. It's now one of three main ones, and has become less so over the last decade and more. It's that gradual reduction I'm watching - if it gets too low, the dollar loses reserve status and the after the tipping point will be too late.

Litecoin doesn't seem to have suffered from a faster generation rate, so ramifications (apart from tooling up and rolling out) should be zero. But then, wouldn't we be in exactly the same position somewhere in the future? Can-kicking isn't a solution.
Bitcoin can manage 7 transactions a second - increasing the block size helps that more than a faster block generation rate.

Bitcoin demands nothing of non-adherents are so is not threatened by fiat. To be most effective though, fiat must exclude competitors. Thus, the stage is set: the question must resolve one way or the other ... and stuff like this that illuminates discussion is to be commended.

Oh, okay. No reputable site should use that kind of security, even if existed: the PR fallout from taking down some grandmother's hacked machine would be a show-stopper. 
Black ICE is an automated concept. I *can* see sites hiring private security to manually track down major malfeasors, as (unlike Black ICE), social-engineering and similar fields have a great track record. The problem is, what use is a head-shot if the other malfeasors don't know who got it, and why?

Yes, but the message is sent independently of the blockchain. Example: you and I have a legal agreement; you write it out and send it to me; I print it and sign it; I then scan the signed agreement and send it to you via email (this is the message); I compute the hash of the scanned agreement and put that small piece of data in the blockchain, as do you; now, neither of us can change the agreement privately without the other being able to say "aha!". Because the agreement was sent via email (or fax, or web upload, or whatever), the notes of that agreement are not available to 3rd parties. 


That's my understanding of the position from now. Some of the comments *may* be very old comments grandfathered into the blockchain while it was still allowed.

**Fun fact:**
In asserting facts you should follow reports [back to their source](
Where the source of the data also says: *"I view it as an absolutely essential matter in Bitcoin economy that there are few very large holders and then proportionately more holders in every smaller holding category. This matter distinguishes Bitcoin from the current system of wealth distribution in the world, where a small elite controls everything and a large percentage has negative equity."*

A reasonable question. I'd say it's a problem because it subverts the market mechanism. I'm looking for a job, Bob and Charlie found "full" pay work at $15ph, Dave found work at $0 per day in an internship doing exactly the same thing. What's the market clearing rate for my labor - $0pd? $105pd?
From an outside point of view, do we want resources tied up in a business that only makes sense if it pays $0pd? Would it be better to creatively destruct such obvious losers? The property they rent should go to higher value employers, for instance; their offices might be better made into a public park: their taxes paid may be lower than the benefit of attracting corps who prefer green space.
As far as the post goes, money's clearly not a problem for Bitcoin Center NYC. They're in NYC for a start. What, the landlord has given them free rent? I don't believe it.

IRL I've found they use conspiracy theories as an exceptionally useful way of forcing authority to account for itself. See the work on simulating what happened on 9/11 - no other country would do anything like that.

I just finished the second half of the Sperandeo video. He handled the crypto questions very badly: the right thing would have been to hold up his hands and say "I don't know enough. I know it's risky, I'll be learning about it, but right now I don't know enough". 
He also refers to there being a death penalty in Weimar Germany for failing to pay taxes. I've read the book he mentions - When Money Dies - and don't remember reading that, nor can find anything about it at Google.
Public speech is very different to academic speech though, so maybe he was mis-remembering. It makes me wonder about whether he's mis-remembered some other fact though. If he had, would it color your thinking?

Excellent article.
FTA, if all y'all read nothing else: 
7 Conclusion
Our analysis of incentives, stability, and governance in Bitcoin shows that Bitcoin is not the fixed, rule-driven, incentive-compatible system that some advocates claim. Although miners currently follow the original rules, this behavior is stable only by consensus and the rules could be changed at any time, either by a Goldfinger-style attacker or by a consensus governance process.
We also conclude that Bitcoin is more amenable to government regulation than advocates claim. The rules can be changed. They have been changed. And a semi-formal Bitcoin governance process is emerging. To the extent that Bitcoin's governance structure is subject to pressure from a regulator, or that a significant fraction of miners or users are subject to regulatory pressure, the regulator will be able to put pressure on the Bitcoin economy to change its rules.
Still, a regulator's power will be limited by participants' ability to fork the Bitcoin rules. Even if a regulator forces the developers to incorporate changes into the Bitcoin rules and reference software, the rest of the Bitcoin community will be able to fork the rules and carry on under the ruleset of its choice. Bitcoin is not immune to regulation, but it is not like traditional currencies either. Bitcoin is the first mainstream open-source currency.

No. Though I could be wrong, I don't think the reference client uses floating point anywhere in the code.
Floating point is used in order to keep storage space down and the size of the values allowed up at some risk to accuracy. When storage is not a problem (and it isn't a problem here), one can store the numbers directly as hexadecimal, or even as text, to as many places as you want, with no loss of accuracy. Conducting mathematical operations on them is trivially easy.

If it becomes desirable to have more miners in the network, then scrypt (LTC) can deliver on that more easily than SHA256 (BTC), and more easily than changing BTC to use scrypt. (Scrypt being easier to implement with off-the-shelf components, harder to implement with potentially expensive bespoke components, thus, the barrier to entry is lower there'd be more miners. *In theory*)

Miners within a pool receive a non-overlapping range of nonces to check, so they will not duplicate effort.

I own equal amounts of both, thanks to their fork.
The primary difference to me between both is in time preference. BTC is a longer term play that looks for far broader foundations that would support a much more diverse economy. BCH is a shorter term play that values market adoption with what's ready now.
Neither of these are necessarily wrong, and indeed we could arguably end up with the best of both worlds.
From a philosophical view I prefer BTC in the basis that Bitcoin Cash tries to tell the market what crypto is for - cash - rather than BTC's more laissez faire attitude of waiting for the market to say what it wants crypto for. Which at the mo is Store Of Value.
From an investment point of view, I think BCH has maybe a couple of years in which - assuming Ver and Jihan keep their noses clean - it could out perform BTC. After that point BTC would have much more the upper hand as what BCH offers would already be available through BTC+LN, for example. Given the recent experience with LN on mainnet two years might have to be substantially reviewed.

NS: (of Hal Finney) "the "mint," which runs on a remote tamper-evident computer" specifies a 3rd party, SN moved the mint onto the local machine.    
NS: "it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was." indicates a PoW algorithm that indicates work, but not how that work may be automatically adjusted. SN described the difficulty adjustment algorithm in use.

I think maybe you're being a bit harsh: you don't need to have millions in USD (or BTC equivalent) - their scale is based on *volume*.
That is: if you have just 1 BTC, and you sell it, then buy it back, then right now that moves you up the scale. If you're market making with that one single BTC, you can quite easily hit 20 millions in volume - that's about 2,000 trades in a month. No need to "have millions"

I stand here in 2018 knowing I was generally right. Crypto, right now, has that same early 1990s feel. No one knows where exactly it's going, and no one pretends to. Except the naysaying economists, and how it can't work because it doesn't fit their models.

Communities on the American frontier were frequently locked out from communication through weather, distance and other factors. This was before even telegraphy was available. Their solution to your question (and also the question of how to handle no physical dollars being available) was to run a local book at the general store of who owed, and was owed, what sums. When communication was again available, the book was reconciled with the wider world. In this case, double-spending was handled by self-interest: to spend money to which you have no claim was to invite calamity when refused access during the next communication blackout. In your case, places that don't have a mobile signal might well recreate such a system. Do we know you? You get credit. Do we not? Then you don't. At worst it increases risk a small bit.

You're confusing two things.     
1. Can they be trusted to create the wallet they say they can?     
2. Can they be trusted with your private key afterwards?    
Whatever the answer to "1" is for you, the answer for "2" must be no: they have no need and offer no service with your private key. I can only imagine giving them your private key is to recreate an original wallet. Why not just photocopy the wallet you originally printed? If you have lost access to that wallet, and there's nothing in it, then I'd say create a new one. If you have lost access to your wallet and there IS something in it, then I'd follow their instructions for **offline** recreation of that wallet.

ELY5. Example: imagine a hash is only three digits long. If there is no leading zero ("999") then there are a thousand possible numbers (0 - 999) that are lower than the hash. If there is ONE leading zero ("099"), there are now only one hundred possible numbers lower than the hash. If there are TWO leading zeros ("009") there are now only ten possible numbers lower than the hash. 
Mining in part guesses a number and sees if it's lower than the hash. Thus, the more leading zeros there are, the fewer numbers will be correctly guessed, and the longer it will take to try again and find another.

Not likely.
1. A 51% attack has to be maintained to be effective, which means the $3bn is increased by their electricity costs for continuing however long they want to
2. The 51% attack would reveal a desire to attack that would draw an appropriate defensive response, and so reduces the likelihood of such an attack working in future AND reveals to other actors in the space (say, Russia) something about the 'weaponry' used
3. Other than the initial chaos, the 51% attack only allows them to double-spend. Uncle Sam is unlikely to spent $3bn+ ensuring he got a chai latte double mocha for free

Given that Bitcoin is so fundamentally different to Government or privately issued instruments it is helpful to distinguish them as different classes. 
Many in the community have chosen to differentiate those classes by designating the latter kind as *fiat*. In effect, deliberately narrowing the previous definition. Time will tell whether the dictionaries follow our use or not.

It does no such thing. Who could you possibly sell your Bitcoin *to* in order to realise the gain? You couldn't sell it to traders for much more than the cost of what they sell without it becoming instantly obvious to the blockchain that now there's very slightly more BTC circulating than before. You couldn't sell it for fiat without others at the exchange noticing that you could sell whatever they wanted and so they'd drop what they'll buy at - u clearly need to sell more than they need to buy.
If one BTC = $1 billion, at that rate your 99.99% might seem 'worth' over $1 billion billion, but that's a paper gain. If you tried to get rid if it, I reckon you'd be lucky to get $10 thousand IF you planned it well.

It's also possible to get GPU damage while not mining - there're rumors going round of bad nvidia drivers (nb: nvida not as good as amd for mining). There's no particular reason to think mining at 64c will be a problem, assuming your card specs say that temp is tolerable.
GPUs (indeed all electronics) often get damaged because of temperature. Metal expands and contracts in the presence/absence of heat, and this can cause otherwise undetectable fractures to close and open, similar to how pot holes are opened in the road by warm rain filling them, frozen nights freezing the rain to ice which expands, thus forcing the pot hole even wider.
This happens to everything that's on. Using it hard (such as with playing games or mining) will make it happen sooner, on average, than using it not much.

Politics is how resource conflict is managed in a necessarily geographically confined space. Cyberspace is not geographically confined, so politics-as-usual cant happen. Second, the 'managed' part can mean someone who is as thick as two short planks has exactly the same say, the same vote, as someone a touch more educated: politics aims to find the policy that has the broadest support - however little that is - in order to legitimate the decision. Seeing as the thick git cannot coerce his boss in cyberspace (by staging a site down protest in the website), and the mule-headed boss cannot screw over his employees (by conspiring with other bosses local to him in cyberspace to keep wages down), the need for democracy as a resource conflict management strategy doesn't exist.

To my mind, the biggest demographic likely to protest the presence of hyperlinks to illegal material in the blockchain are likely to be American religious zealots: bible belters arguably tend to be more fundamentalist than any other section of Christianity; they tend to have a much lower understanding of technological issues than normal people; they tend to reach for the gun faster than other Christian sects, and those that don't tend to be much more vocal politically than their brothers and sisters elsewhere. If anyone in the West is likely to make this a problem, they will. Additionally, I use the parallel of what they consider important in their faith to show the disconnect of what they claim ("Child pron links are bad") and what they accept (repeated use of "666".)

What makes BTC different is the concept of a distributed ledger. 
A normal bank keeps it's ledger to itself, so no-one knows what they're up to - with a distributed ledger, *everyone* knows. 
Previous digital currencies (I think you and they mean that, not crypto currencies) have indeed been around a while. Indeed, the US dollar is one of them. They have all use private ledgers.

The "Location" header is used to tell your browser to visit another web page. On this occasion, probably because the main site is down, so the server was trying to redirect you to the "we're down" page. For whatever reason, your browser received two or more of those Location headers - only one should be received, so as a security measure, all were ignored. You being the nearest human, it dutifully reported that fact to you.

Incorrect. According to me, if the reward per block was suddenly removed, miners would leave. Remaining miners who understand they can charge what they like would put up the transaction fees they would personally accept. Those using Bitcoin who add that transaction fee would get in the blockchain, those who don't, won't and will have to bid up. Those mining who put up their fees too far would get no work and have to ask down. Whatever level they meet at, it would be at a level profitable to miners generally, the opposite of "mining for free". Such hashrate changes as would be found are a byproduct of this process, not a cause of it, so the question (and answer) to "what determines the hashrate" is irrelevant -- the hashrate will end up at a level consistent with low cost to the user, and profit to the miner.


Transaction fees are currently implemented to include block rewards. Assuming you continue to mean how they would be implemented absent block rewards, that mechanism is called "The market" and was explained both in the reply above here, and in my original post.

Off the top of my head:
1. While the return is likely to be less than what you put in, the probability of nevertheless being in profit is non-zero. It's a gamble, but you *might* come out ahead.
2. It keeps you engaged with the mining scene such that *if* the difficulty fell, you would be ready to profit as soon as it did

How about an escrow company, accept BTC and prepaid card PINs. Anyone wanting to sell cash has to buy and load a prepaid card and provide PIN to escrow, physically provides party 1 the prepaid card along with receipt for what got loaded. Party 1 confirms receipt and releases escrow, party 2 releases escrow on confirmation party 1 has released. If both done, party 2 gets his BTC, party 1 gets the PIN, takes the prepaid card away and draws down.
The cash is thus dealt with by a 3rd party (the store) so security &amp; cash handling is done. The only problem is the prepaid card if personal safety still an issue: party 1 could put it envelope and USMail it to himself immediately on receipt. Preferably a prepaid account that doesn't have Internet access so can't be drained in between purchase and Party 1 accessing it.

An example. I'm in the UK at the moment, which -- with all the other EU member countries (Note, nothing to do with *Euro* countries) has two features:
1. A Value Added Tax on the sale of silver coins
2. A law that counts the Value Added Tax as entirely paid throught out the EU *if paid in the member country where purchase occured*.
As different member countries tax silver coins at different rates, this allows for jurisdictional shopping: I could buy the silver coins in the UK, and pay 20% VAT. I could buy them in Germany, and pay just 7% VAT. Indeed, I could buy the coins in Estonia where the VAT rate is 0%. The fact that the VAT was properly accounted for and paid at 0% in Estonia and that undermines the UK (and German) revenue is neither here nor there, and in importing those coins to the UK (within bounds), no further taxes are payable: I have kept my costs down considerably - and entirely legally - down. I have literally shopped for a jurisdiction that suits my wallet better.
How does this impact Bitcoin, and Dion's paper? The major exchange is in Japan, subject to Japanese law at the moment; probably the second largest is Bitstamp in the European Union country of Slovenia. Let's assume for the moment that Both .JP and .EU slavishly follow the American lead on AML/KYC rules. There are rumors that the Chinese are being exceptionally tolerant of Bitcoin. What if they encourage their ally Venezuela to open up an exchange, the next exchange trying to get into the game? They (The Venezuelan Government) are appallingly short of hard currency. Their Chinese sponsor is less enthusiastic about AML/KYC rules than the Americans, particularly if it gets the Venzuelans off their back. You should be ahead of me by now: we could wire money to a Venezuelian exchange with fewer (or more agreeable) rules. This impacts Dion's paper in two ways.
1. It gives Venezuela a competitive advantage over the US when it comes to a bitcoin ecosystem. In order to compete with it, the US would be forced to loosen the tools Dion mentions.
2. It gives the United States a Unique Selling Point, in the bitcoin ecosystem: the US (through regulation) imbues US Exchanges as more confidence inspiring for the nervous user. Again, the laws would have to be modified to best implement that policy.
For these reasons I think Dion's paper is incomplete by restricting US policy response according to only what happens within its borders.
*Editing for bits and pieces!
@_date: 2013-05-17 03:53:47
Why do you think this?
I'm not sure that it'd be useful, so let me give you an example. If there are two exchanges where one has a price of $113.70 (as BitStamp currently is) and the other has a price of $117.48 (as MtGox currently is) then the average price is $115.59. Yet you can't sell for that, nor buy for that, without losing about 1.6% of your USD or BTC. What use is that average price, then?

But for those there that know the State's interest doesn't always align with their own families safety, what will they do? Because if any State has the interest, power and motivation to do something, it'll be theirs.
I suspect they'll warn darkly about what they'd do to malefactors, trot out the odd user they accidentally caught (but not admit to that accident) and I wouldn't put it past them to introduce a new capital offence.

That's not what you're doing though - you yourself said that it's not in production. The toyota is "in production". OT, you say, is not. From what I've read of yours, you're closer to Lord Kelvin, who worked in Physics and Engineering, who saw someone espousing aeronautics and commented "No balloon and no aeroplane will ever be practically successful." He was wrong, but maybe you're right. Maybe not: Maybe OT will be moderately successful like html. Maybe it'll show promise, like bitcoin. Maybe it'll be nice-but-too-ahead-of-its-time, like PGP. 
So far, I'm not convinced by what seems to be your assertion, that OT will not work. For instance: "the issue of convertibility and bonding does remain- the ISSUER needs to honor the digital asset for a real world asset." While true, this is disingenuous as it's a risk applicable to any counter-party digital asset, such as Euros, as the Cypriots clearly now know. It's not a show-stopper.
I'm a dev (but not in anything bitcoin related) but I don't hold "beliefs" in what OT may or may not do -- the proof is in the eating and there's not much to eat. But so begin all projects (gmail was beta for years); fellowtraveler handles criticism well; such parts of OT as I've looked at I've been comfortable with; the flaws do not seem insuperable.

He's not. It's confirmation bias to read Bitcoin into what he's saying.
As the video states, he was speaking in 1996. Back then (I was there!) there was a much greater sense that history could go one of two ways: either to create larger and larger political units (the EU and NAFTA were both examples of this drive), or smaller and smaller political units (Canada/Quebec, Flemish and Walloons in Belgium , Italy and the Northern League, Yugoslavia were examples of this other drive.)
I don't know who that is in the video, but it's clear that he's concerned about former drive, and doesn't know about the latter.

Places without telephone connectivity tend to be places without stores and the like so it might seem there's no problem. If one did need to buy a pair of snow shoes in the middle of an Ohio corn field in mid May, I suppose one could use satellite connectivity. If it was a general need, then a single store could buy in that satellite connectivity and you could go to the store to do it. 
After the zombie apocalypse, however, Imma gonna guess it will happen the old-fashioned way: the general store keeps a paper ledger, when you buy stuff it goes in the ledger, when your locale sells stuff to other locales, that flushes the ledger.

Am I right in thinking that even IF you can get the longest chain, your only advantage is to be able to double-spend coin you spent before the attack? IE, you might be able to respend the value of that pizza, or respend the value of that car, but you'd be unable to spend coin you didn't own before the attack, nor able to spend other people's money even since the attack?
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:20:04
It would be possible, one way or another, although it would very much rely on a website agency doing the main work: "buy $2.00  is clear enough. 
However if you meant have the coins itself via the phone, that's probably not a goer -- who's going to remember their addresses, and type them in? You'd need either a specific phone (where you could add the address once then fast-key it in use), or an app. At which point, you might as well get a full-on data-capable handset instead.
The last point is that SMS is one of the most expensive methods of sending data known to man, so it may not be cost-effective.
I do *very* much like the idea though!
@_date: 2013-06-13 09:14:24
Ah! Okay I misunderstood there. 
I think one has to remember the Gold price says more about the fiat for which it's being exchanged than about the metal itself: if the price falls by 50% USD over a couple years, that's saying something about the USD. Likely? Certainly looks plausible looking around the world today - the (western) world's been in a rut since 2006 and I don't see an end. 
Still, I'd dollar cost average the Gold down too.

It doesn't necessarily follow that the same institutions are going to manage it. We may call a Bitcoin bank "a bank" because it serves our purpose to do so, but it'll be a very different entity to your Wells Fargo.
WF won't go poof because this is fundamentally about choice: your choice to stay with fiat and bank with WF, WFs choice to serve you in fiat. While you make that choice, so might WF. My choice is to not use WF (or competitors). You can take the Cyprus-style haircuts, and I'll happily leave you to it without helping you out.
To the extent that BTC could be tracked and taxed, it would *still* be a superior alternative to USD because it could not be inflated. That puts huge pressures back on your politicians, and by extension, you. Are you worried? You should be.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:50:49
There was a recent AMA involving an economist. It became clear she had an assumption that the Bitcoin payment network ('means of exchange' in her language) was exactly equivalent to the Dollar payment network. With that faulty assumption, it would follow that the utility of the Dollar (pound, yen) network having utility because it's backed, it must follow that if they were not backed, they would not have utility.
I'll next time *start* by saying the Bitcoin is not equivalent and interchangeable with the Dollar in the way Dollars are interchangeable with Euros: Dollars / yuan / roubles handle fraud with recourse at law. Bitcoin handles fraud by not allowing it.

To prevent against false witnesses. If a bad guy has a high amount of processing power, he can potentially witness fake transactions, like getting everyone to send him their money. To stop this, the difficulty goes up when people with high amounts of power come in, and so everyone who was using CPUs, now needs to use graphics cards, to stop the bad guys. Rinse, repeat.

Not luck, just resources. If I was a State wanting to do it, I'd set up a fake set of addresses that don't exist anywhere then order from that seller. The us mail computers could then be watched to determine where those addresses were first observed in the system. Now we know the rough area the seller is in. Outside collection? Put our guy in a truck and have each package checked for the fake address before entering into the system to determine which round bought it in. Now we know the likely few square miles he's in. Then divide the round into several to determine the post box being used, now we know where he'll be in future. Then set up a camera and video who reappears each time there's a drop. Now ordinary police work takes over.

A bitcoin address for everyone to transact through would not work (for long, if at all) because it would be trivial to use a different address - and thus look no different in the blockchain to someone in another country - and very difficult to enforce: expensive hardware to prevent different address use, expensive rollouts to the hardware to consumers and merchants - who pays for the internet connections? What happens if the internet is down? What if the card goes through the washing machine?

I'd argue the latter. First, I very much doubt either of us know more than one or two Silk Roaders, never mind "all the folks" to assume their motiviations. Second, it was quite clear to anyone thinking for half a minute how to triangulate who the vendors &amp; purchasers were with standard police techniques.
I would suggest that many people SRd for other reasons: 1: it's obvious that it was safer for their persons to SR than buy at a street corner; 2: it seems obvious that SR stallholders had higher quality product given that low quality product would see bad reviews left; 3: there was hearsay from some in the po-po that this kind of trade was 'less' of an issue than street level deals and 4: the interstate and international nature of the trade raised the bar for prosecution and thus made it *more* private and *more* untraceable than doing it on the street: as you say, the record mattered less.

If the banks did implement a MintChip kind of facility, it'd be extraordinary. I think the price of BTC would have upward pressure (as people found it easier to buy and to use out-of-nation-state, returning to dollars for just long enough to complete a sale) but also downward pressure: MintChip exchanges as described seems awfully hard to raise sales taxes from. $15?

To be fair, I think you should honour the original quote. Here in the UK, a quote is a contract to exchange at that price, and you could be sued for not keeping to it. An estimate is perhaps what you're describing, which isn't legally binding.
I think I might deal with it by charging slightly more for an initial purchase to cover that risk, then honour the original quote if and when they come back. That way you're covered from the risk, and then after you've got a good client who knows you're good for the price agreed.

No. First the developers would have to accept that update. Second, a majority of miners would have to accept that update. Assuming they did, and it proved malign, there's precedent that the miners would say "You know what? Let's call carry on from just before that last update" and the developers would have to follow (or fork). This is one of the risks of using BTC right now - that you might get your transaction cancelled.


The human in charge of the client makes that choice, not the client.

I do, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what's being asserted?
While mining is part of the infrastructure, the actual routines that handle the cryptography will no doubt be plug-and-playable - md5 and sha1 are mutually incompatible, yet either could serve as a hash in place of the other should the need arise (whether that's desirable is a different matter.) There'd be no need to change any other code outside the immediate parent routine, no need to change general purpose hardware it runs on, no need to change how the blockchain works (ok, perhaps 'widening' the hash might require such a change), nor how the p2p side of things is addressed, no need to change exchanges, nor client UIs, etc, all of which goes to make up what I understand by "infrastructure".
The only other problem I can conceive of is if a cryptography library is constructed straight onto the silicon. Even then, it's only a problem for the owner of that particular silicon if the chip is soldered down (ie, doesn't use BGAs or DIPs etc so the chips can be swapped out). However, this is a risk that miner took on. He can continue to play with upgraded hardware, or bail from the game and so increase incentives for other people to take his place.
Incompatible cryptography seems to me to lead to very little impact on the infrastructure. It seems akin to saying that it makes existing banks harder to use simply because we issue different security designs on the dollar.

*Bitcoin* mining is on a trajectory that would see mining centralized around geographic areas associated with cheap/free electricty: desert regions for the sun, geothermal power sources such as hot springs. This is a factor of mining being processor (and therefore, electricity) intensive, and having to be more intensive in order to secure the network.
Your nose should have twitched at my use of the word "centralised". It's conceivable that bitcoin mining thus becomes more of a target for regulation because those who engage in it will more be found in specific places. 
*Litecoin* mining is less rewarded by power inputs, and more rewarded by memory access, and as a result, depends more on access to cheap RAM and less on access to cheap electricity than with Bitcoin. As a result, Litecoin mining regulation would seem much harder, given it could be done anywhere cheap RAM could be delivered to a postbox.
Now the hundred Bitcoin question. Do you expect Bitcoin mining to be regulated, where? And by whom? If No, then there's no point to Litecoin. If Yes, then Litecoin can be expected to appreciate versus Bitcoin when it happens, and so getting in now would be the same risk/reward as getting into Bitcoin a couple years ago. Similar arguments could be made for other altcoins.

You make a mistake here:


... and everything that follows is based on that faulty assertion, and therefore wrong. Let me explain why I think assertion is mistaken.
The "greed" is a facet of *hoarding*, and hoarding doesn't matter. There are a finite set of bitcoins in the world. Those which are in peoples wallets for use shortly, those which have been lost, and those which are being saved. What is the difference between BTC being saved, and those that are lost? None whatsoever, as far as anyone other than the owner knows. 
So if a BTC is lost, no-one knows, and the value of the remaining BTC rise to match. Ergo, if a BTC is *saved*, no-one knows, and the value of the remaining BTC rise to match. If the lost BTC is found, or the saved coin is eventually spent, the value of the remaining BTC must logically fall to match. Thus, it matters not a bit to Bitcoin whether someone is greedy and keeps his all. 
An extreme example. Let's say Obama gets ahold of half of all Bitcoins, and saves them -- doesn't spend them. The value of the remaining coins rise to accommodate the economy. Wow, thinks Obama, now I'm super rich, I'll sell them! But as soon as he sells them, everyone notices that there are more coins in circulation and before he can swap his hoard for goods and services, the prices of those goods and services have gone up. The farmer charges more for carrots, the laborer for his help, and eventually on to us. The prices stay high because there're more coins in circulation, but it doesn't matter because we're all charging more. And Obama has no more hoard left.
Bitcoin solves the problem of the increasingly uneven distribution of wealth among the population by making it next to impossible to benefit from it.

In a wider interpretation, you're right that there's a record of all transactions that coin has been involved in. However, because each wallet address is pseudonymous, the IRS would not have access to who the address belongs to, unless they get a hold of that wallet itself. That's not going to happen until the owner is already under arrest for some other offense. 
As it's not unreasonable to expect the wallet to be used and deleted by The Bad Guys (from the view of the IRS) who may or may not even be in American jurisdiction at the time, it's equally true that for the IRS, this is also a nightmare come true.

Please bear in mind that there are two realms to Bitcoin: upto and including the Exchange is regular-able under laws local to the Exchange's jurisdiction. Once "on the wire" though, the situation is more akin to the laws of the sea: Congress has no power where it has no ships. I say this because "bitcoin theft" is happening in that second place. If it so happens that someone confesses to the crime, then it can be dealt with as an ordinary theft, with ordinary laws.


The kind that comes with enforceable rights of access to the Bitcoin economy.


Right now, the former realm would suffer more than benefit: Bitcoin is not ready for primetime. In second realm would see regulation as laughable. Worse - irrelevant.


It should be no different to common thefts. The USD price - if one is needed - can be the average on the day the theft was reported.

The problem right now is that a quantum computer returns "a jumbled mess of every possible answer". Cryptography - and by extension bitcoins - are safe for now.
IMHO, even IF a quantum computer could be created that broke bitcoins, it'd still be safe: there is no way on earth the spooks would reveal that they had such a computer to the foreign nations (and others) whose communications they could listen in on in order to catch Charlie Muggins using BTC.

@_date: 2013-12-21 14:43:59
That's a very good thought experiment! 
Were they to try anything on short of breaking the cryptography I suspect the effect would not only be limited but very likely counter-productive. My logic is this: whatever else is done if it does not happen to all BTC users simultaneously then it will harm some users more than others. That allows time to excise whatever route the attack came. 
Targeted assassination for instance. It would not affect BTC users who've wouldn't recognize names of leading lights. Thus, any 'panic' would be confined, and people would notice - hey, actually this doesn't affect the value on my wallet. Development would be forced underground maybe, it would be slowed, maybe. They might hope for more from a high-profile whack. 
Or let's say bitcoin-qt is backdoored. Those with clients from before the backdoor would be unaffected directly as would those not using the client at all. If the backdoor allowed them to sweep all funds into their own account, then I can easily imagine most panic until people realize not everyone's affected, and the economy resets starting from he last unbackdoored client. 
The only way to affect everyone is to break the cryptography. Arguably even *then* a restart with new crypto is feasible.

I'm not an expert, but I've a small amount of insight: 
1. AIUI, QC suffers at the moment. If you ask a question, you'll receive every possible answer back. The trick is discovering the *right* answer from among them.
2. Also AIUI, bitcoins uses several different cryptography algorithms feeding one answer into the next. QC would have to break all three to compromise security; breaking one will leave enough time to replace it.
3. Is the killer. No government anywhere would dare reveal they had a QC capable of this level of cryptographic attacks -- the value in secretly breaking every other nation's communications is &gt; the value of destroying bitcoin!

1. Its normal in software projects that logically separate tasks be separated out into different programs: consider Word and Excel are separate. Although bitcoin wallet and mining are separate, they do interact through the same blockchain.
2. Miners witness transactions and I suspect that's what you mean by 'verify'. Every wallet owner verifies those transactions - tests that they are sound - before using the funds available. By witnessing a transaction, the Miner is given the right to add that transaction to the blockchain as part of another block.

Pretty much, though the PC is now merely administering expensive hardware not just mining on its own.
Think of mining like witnessing something, like being a witness in court. With mining, your computer is trying to be a witness to Jim and Joe trading with each other.

In the UK there's the theft of '[abstraction]( which would seem somewhat kin; and AIUI UK law doesn't always recognize the idea of jurisdiction: if Parliament chooses to make it an offense to smoke in the streets of Paris, then any offender in front of a British court for that offense could well be convicted and sentenced for it. This is by way of saying that different countries with different systems may well see some have little need of extra law. 
As for bitcoin theft, there's the possibility of private investigative companies: some businesses could sign up to reporting stolen purchases without public knowledge, an investigative team could track stolen coins going to one of those companies, who'd report who it was that paid the coins over. At that point, the regular police force in whichever jurisdiction could be involved.

I should perhaps have written "can be -" rather than "are blocked". It is another choice, though. As [Non-UK viewers are blocked from certain content]( it's plain that there's no technological or legal impediment to blocking international visitors to particular sets of 'internal' content. 
All this talk of Walls prohibiting access. Very Berlin, 1960s, no? Very Rupert Murdoch. 


Really? Lets get brutal with the maths with his "Blue Planet" (2001) which cost £16m. What would it have cost *you* to properly compensate for its production, if it had been done privately? As I can't find the figures, I'm going to pretend there's no cost of stamping DVDs, distribution, retail profits etc to cover; and to compensate, pretend non-UK sales match UK sales. That is, UK buyers only have to cover £8m. 
When made, the BBC budget was c£2.6bn, so Blue Planet represented 0.61% of it. The licence fee being £109 then, you actually paid 65 pence towards Blue Planet. BP sold 3 million DVDs in the USA and so by maths, could have sold 600,000 in the UK were it similarly popular. That would have meant a price tag of about £13.50 per DVD. No wonder you think it worthwhile - you got a £13.50 show for 65p! Thus, had only UKers who watched it (and would have paid to watch it) paid for it, their licence fee would be just north of £2,250. 
So you should actually have written "David Attenborough's documentaries are worth the license fee alone, and I'll support criminal conviction against 20 other people if they refuse to subsidise me." Easy to spend other people's money, eh.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the BBC per se, I'm against their funding model. I'd be happy to see them completely paid from general taxes; it's clear from BBCWS that this represents no danger as to quality or 'pressure'. 


I prefer the Guardian website, and if I have to watch anything for news, I'll watch Al-Jazeera. BBC news has been too parochial for quite some time, but I recognise a preference for the international is my taste. For music, I stream the kind I like from the Netherlands.

1. It provides a mechanism by which those who have spare resources can profit in an exchange with those who have the ability to use those resources more productively. A better place to ask the question is 2. There's no reason at all why you can't offer credit in BTC so it does surprise me to hear that suggested - I'm unable to check your links as to where that errors from. What would happen is someone wanting to lend out money would first have to borrow those BTC themselves OR they would issue credit notes guaranteeing to pay BTC at some future point, and those notes could be used as money. How happy people would be to receive those notes instead of actual BTC depends very much on the issuer

My understanding is that the protocol can (or will) store the state of a binary bet of the kind you've described, but would require a third party to honour it. That is, it'll be public knowledge that the bet was made, was accepted, and was paid out, but it's still for the counter-party to actually pay out.
There is (or will be) also a cryptographic means of escrowing a transfer that may be related: X says Y owes him 1 BTC, Y denies it, both go to mediation through person Z. Y has to send Z that 1 BTC. Z decides who owes what, and can then decide it should go 50/50 to both and sends that 1 BTC on as appropriate. The trick is that the protocol allows that Z can *only* send that payment to X or Y, he cannot keep it for himself nor pass it on to a third party.

You could fork and extend [bind]( rather than create a new service, and so immediately provide service to multiple platforms and clients on them that need no new software other than what they already use for DNS lookups:
dig  -t BTCREAD jim
 and DNS updates: 
dig  -y user:password -t BTCWRITE jim 1HbQA9CMpLoLck55qBoxseT5KssBD3Anq9
This would dramatically reduce all four things you'd have to do.
Your biggest question will be about security. For instance, a rogue netadmin could arrange that all responses from his copy of bind would send back his own btc address. This would be resolved by involving the recipient's email address, an expiry time in his own keypair generation such that the netadmin would have to quickly discover a collision keypair that happens to work for both his and the victim's email address. That could wait for later though, but would mean you'd have to put big warning signs all over your service beforehand!

I'm not convinced that this represents a tragedy of the commons. To the extent that space and bandwidth is a non-zero cost, the owner is making an assessment that his own particular advantage (whether reckoned in money or otherwise) lies in storing and communicating the blockchain. Should his assessment turn negative, he is free to stop handling the blockchain. Should so many assessments turn negative that it represents a real problem, Satoshi has already suggested the solution: prune the blockchain. 
The blockchain is currently 0.63% the size of a standard 2Tb hard drive. Storing it is not a cost, as the entire cost has already been sunk in purchasing the hard drive.
Communicating the blockchain currently takes about 1.3Gb per calendar month (assuming receiving once, and uploading once) when the average user uses roughly 17Gb per month, and the common cap appears to be 30Gb per month. Therefore communicating the blocks are not a cost as again, the entire cost has been paid in receiving connectivity in the first place.

That's not true, and even if it was, it wouldn't matter. It's not true because there's only a certain amount of space to store the number, and so the number must be finite. The protocol allows for extra decimal places, but that only allows that part of an existing number can be divided into more units - the overall value doesn't change.

No. If an alt solves the microtransaction problem, you can bet your ass that Bitcoin will quickly adopt it.


Micro-transactions have been "the future" since the late 1990s when it was thought websites would be able to charge for content, and it's has proved not to be so - the market at large doesn't *want* to bill with micro-transactions: gambling, pron and content-driven all seem to do just fine with larger (ie, $1+) transactions.

It couldn't happen without a prior repudiation of all debt the country currently owes. For a country with its own currency like Argentina, that consequences for outsiders are fairly minor. But for countries that have reserve status (US, UK, Japan, Euro, China, Aus and Canada), the consequences will never be the same: all the pensioners in other countries who have leant money to the US, for instance, through their pension scheme will suddenly have nothing, nada, zilch. Their own countries would halve to pick up the slack, but suddenly can't: who wants to countries that are bankrupted with liabilities like that? think Greece, in most countries. 
Inside the country, and following repudiation, I'd imagine there'd be somewhat less trauma. Bitcoins that are available go through price discovery as each is needed to handle part of the economy. Price inflation.

Good, someone with a brain.
You make my point for me. I'll explain: recall I started off with "the Apple angle has always been to do much fewer things than other people, but to do those far, far better." You mention TimeMachine, iTunes Match, TBM, Firewire and Gestures: all good examples of them vastly improving what has gone before: backups, audio-, association- and tag-matching, booting from external disks and serial. Let's take the Gestures. [Put-That-There]( should be enough to put to bed that Apple had the vision to create it; they didn't. Their first hint of gesture was the Newton, seven years later (and then abandoned). I skip journaling as I was never involved enough to contest your assertion, however it doesn't matter as each thing you mention was a good step *behind the scenes*. This is how you make my point: the good stuff they do is behind the scenes in order to support their angle where I assert they lack vision: fewer things, far better. 
Now back - at last - to the thread, within which all this has context. What, anywhere in Apple's history, gives reason to suspect that Apple have in them the 'vision' to take up Bitcoin? Where have, to the user, they done *more* things than what others are doing (not just existing things, better?) What have they currently that suggests they're taking us to a brave new world of X, where X is novel to even a technical user? Surely not waste-basket format system units. If they did risk something "new" in the PC space, MS would have slaughtered them. Likewise Android in the handheld space. Fewer things, higher cost, better experience: it's the only way they could - or can - survive. If you want an example of something 'new' in the space, I'd point to parallax on Android: a user coded it up, it got popular, Apple co-opted it for the 5s.
Returning to your original question, I at least match you for hours. I started using UK101s and ZX80s in '79/'80 and have been gainfully employed in the sector since about 1986. If you would like to reminisce about having to unroll Z80 loops in the days before any (never mind decent) assemblers, much less IDEs and modern new-fangled processors that obsolete the need for unrolling, well, too bad; I'll put something in my memoirs!

In particular, an English dictionary attack goes after English speakers. Chinese users would be unaffected, as would any other languages that require unicode. If it appeared likely that you could find a collision in a reasonable time-frame, I'd expect deterministic wallets to be deprecated, or further secured: for instance by adding a telephone number.

Not triage, logic. If someone is of such limited intellect that they're put off BTC by price as a 'psychological barrier' then I for one would rather they stay out. These are early days and dealing with needy people with psychological issues they don't realize are fake would distract existing participants. 
On the other hand, there are real and actual problems that get posted here every day, particularly in the field of exchanging between fiat and BTC; in participant discovery (which stores where will take BTC?); in security ("I didn't realize 'password' was a poor password. Who'll sell me a hardware wallet?"); and risk ("Where are the opposition looking, instead of Cyprus?"). Logic: What expands the network to participants capable of joining in?

I'm not entirely clear how Chinese actually get ahold of BTC as the country still has capital controls. If they're only buying from the miners in the country (conspiracy alert! What it the nobs are the miners, and that's why they're boosting BTC?) then we'd expect the Chinese value of BTC to somewhat unhinged from the USD prices. Yet [here]( says the price is close.

I know my shit, or at least I like to think so, but I'm regularly impressed by people far more insightful than I, usually buried in the comments, and often very poorly voted up.

Having just looked through the hot tab, it does seem like very slight variations on already answered questions as people of more or less the same level bring each other along to a greater understanding of previous answers.

Being militarily effective in land wars such as the last two world wars mandates being able to command resources within territories: democracies can command more than state socialist, so would more likely win (and did.) The problem is at the end there: "within territories." There has never been an easier, cheaper time to travel and do business across the world so people are much more tolerant of others. There has never been a time when efficiency can so overwhelm effectiveness at war either: for every $1 the 9/11 hijacking cost the bad guys, the United States is thought to have spent $6,600,000. For these reasons and others, there'll not be another 'world war' like the one's we've seen.
Let's think things go tits-up anyway: say China invades Taiwan, Russia and India take the opportunity to give them a kicking, and the West joins in (however surreptitously) because China is getting too big for their boots. Not quite a World War (unless China is minded to fling ICBMs which for the sake of argument, let's assume are conventionally rather than nuclear-tipped, and so vast armies are sent to invade China back.) You'd expect gold and silver to be seized, dollars to be inflated dramatically. BTC could be requisitioned by the Chinese, perhaps, and their people might happily send them to the center. However, what China could buy with them is limited - but the fact China wanted them would send them through the roof. At the same time, dollars would be inflated and so the BTC would appear to be worth more anyway.

If that's what you really think about the people who got here first, who settled the protocol, built the exchanges, created the clients, add the liquidity so others might buy in and sell out, formed the stores, populated the forums and whose shoulders upon whom you *dare* to stand, then perhaps you'd find a more accomodating audience in And then I read "but will eventually make way for a more evenly distributed version".

A transaction must come *from* somewhere, and that somewhere gets recorded in the blockchain. So, it can be seen that D got his coin from C, that C go that coin from B ... and she got her coin from A. However, we can't directly tell the names of A, B, C and D. In fact, all four could be the same person passing money back to himself. To tie any of those transactions to an IP or a named person requires more work than looking at the blockchain.
Receiving cannot be tied to your IP address. Bitcoin protocol itself cannot tie sending to an IP address on it's own, but a website might record that your IP was the one that sent a particular payment. New addresses cannot be linked to previous address you've owned through the protocol itself, only by leaked information -- ie, a website recording that OvermindTechnology twice paid for two items with different bitcoin addresses from the same IP address, the IP address being recorded when you filled in the form.

You're missing something. Let's say the US owes $100,000 to China, and each bitcoin is worth (today) $1000. So, today, America could pay off it's debt to China with 100 BTC. 
If bitcoins became the world currency though, that American debt *stays* at 100BTC (it's now the world currency, remember) and lots of people are demanding bitcoins, and so the price of bitcoins reaches $5000 each. Now, to pay China 100BTC, America has to buy $500,000 worth of bitcoins. 
Far from being debt free, America's debt just skyrocketed!

I once gave a reddit troll his employer's phone number. It was about two hour's work, but the silence thereafter was delightful. He was lazy, though.
For you, 20 minutes work means I can only suggest: You're American and with high probability living in a smaller city or one of the more western blue US states; male aged &gt; 30, has or is using Linux, is a programmer. 
With more resources: as username is relatively opaque, it would be profitable to use language analysis on users at bitcointalk and a variety other 'scene' venues, starting with your favoritest verb: 'astroturf'. 
Without more resources, but with more time a social attack would probably bear fruit: clearly helpful and responsible with your good work here in how could you pass up demonstrating both in a well-constructed PM? Something that eventually continues along the lines of "I don't understand &lt;content&gt; at &lt;you dont know it's my site&gt;" should see you question whether to boot up a browser bundle or just visit direct and hand over your IP address.

If I were you, turn off the mac immediately.
There's an outside chance that they reused the original hard drive. If so, the hard drive reinstallation procedure does not itself wipe the contents of unused sectors, such that those sectors *can* contain data from the original setup.
Attach the hard drive to another machine, and run [Handy Recovery]( trial on that mac's hard drive. If there's data to be found, it will list it; the trial allows you to restore one file a day - and the file you want is wallet.dat.
You say "I unfortunately couldn't back up my computer before taking it into repair." If you have a backup (particularly time machine) from *any* point between installing the wallet software and the repair, the nature of the wallet means that "old" wallet can be used to recover access to your BTC.

Your post assumes volatility is bad. One day it might be, but not yet: with so many people not sure about what it'll be worth, volatility could be considered an acceptable cost in finding out. Think of it the other way: if the bitcoin was stable, what if it was stable at the wrong price?
Tying to fiat is a terrible idea -- it recentralizes that which tries to be decentralised. Limiting trades to a long period is unenforceable.

As much power as they throw at it, the protocol is still only designed to generate 25 coins every 10 minutes whether they add 1 ASIC, 10000 asics or 10 million. So they'll not earn excessive BTC that way. It's riskier that they would have &gt;50% of miners, but that will only let them double spend their own coins, and delay the original blockchain. If they don't frig the blockchain, I think I'm right in saying the problem exists only its potential. If they do frig the blockchain, we would need to hope the devs land upon an effective way of firewalling off all those asics.

Oh, *absolutely*. Bitcoin is Risk Central right now, and for at least five years into the future - I can agree to that. 


(For the purposes of this exercise I'm not correcting your implication that a bitcoin can be stored in a building, but assuming the nearest equivalent: that a bitcoin must be forwarded to a state-provided account from where it might then be used.)
You posit a reasonable situation, that bitcoin gets deposited into banks, from which the rest of your text naturally, and logically follows. However I think you are overlooking the comparative advantages of bitcoin over fiat: while it is true that people may deposit bitcoins in bricks and mortar banks, if all else is equal, the bitcoin so deposited will represent a fraction of the bitcoins owned by Cypriots and available for deposit whereas now the fiat approaches the whole of all fiat owned by Cypriots and available for deposit. 
The pertinent comparative advantage here is two-fold: first, the vastly lower transaction fees ensure that there is no cost penalty to storing your bitcoin in a Vietnamese bank as opposed to the Cypriotic bank, nor any cost penalty to using your bitcoin from Vietnam. If your bitcoin is held in a Cypriot bank, it is because the business has *chosen* to store it there. This is a fundamental change from the current position where storing &amp; using local currency in and from foreign bank incurs significant transaction charges. (There may even be a cost advantage to storing it in Vietnam, if their Government is willing to rent that money from you -- a loan.)
Second, the statelessness and basic level of anonymity inherent in bitcoin means that a: a state cannot lay claim to 'this' or 'that' bitcoin but not another (in the way that a Dollar is known to be American, or a Baht to be Thail) and b: that it is significantly more difficult to determine if the bitcoin on deposit with the authorities is all the bitcoin that should be on deposit. 
The question is, then, could a state successfully require every person and every business to lodge their bitcoins with an approved institution? I suggest that such a policy would prove so ridden with exceptions (Children studying abroad? A foreign office for sales?) that it would only catch those unable to leave. In contemporary terms, the seizures would only affect those below $100k in the bank, not those above.

I think much of what you say is arguable, so I'm going to argue them: not because I think the questions can be settled now, but because I think they'll be settled later somewhere between our two positions.
I'm firmly of the belief that Bitcoin is at least four or five years from maturing into something 'background', like a telephone, or a car - a wonder to those who saw them invented, not thought of twice by those for whom they were always there. That marks our current place in its history as Very Early Days. 
If I'm right, I conclude that all your points will need to be addressed in time, but that they are not addressed as of now is immaterial. Bitcoin needs to walk before it can run - and what we see now is not even walking - it's learning to walk. Just as a toddler will land on its bum on the way, so we see volatility.
This volatility is at the center of your first three points. My understanding is that there has yet to be an experiment with a pure deflation economy: even gold suffered tremendous inflation when the Portuguese bought so much of it back from the new world. Thus, I don't think we can yet say that Bitcoin cannot inherently deliver on stable price levels although I agree it has yet to. In particular, just as external factors meant communism couldn't ultimately be stable, there could be externalities to Bitcoin - such as the geopolitical environment - that mean it cannot last.
As a store of value, you're right. So it's said, you can at least wallpaper your house if your currency inflates too far, or burn it for heat, but these are negligible uses for paper money as contrasted with what was intended for them, so I would argue that Bitcoin not having the ability to at least wallpaper or burn is of no consequence - paper money also is poor store of value, and look where it is. With Bitcoin, perhaps the only intrinsic value would be the stories and lessons it'll teach those who come later. Further, in its limited time thus far, Bitcoin has faced dramatic falls following security issues (and more recently the lawsuit vs MtGox), faced pressure from mainstream banks, faced a zombie-like herd of speculators who know little and understood less. Even so, it's still there - it has retained "*some significant value*". Greater threats are certainly to come.
As for not easy to use, I totally agree. I've worked in IT for decades, and it has taken me almost a month to get to a backup arrangement I'm happy can manage most catastrophes. There are interesting projects that layer on top of Bitcoin and provide the ease of use and security you expect, but it's far too soon to expect them to be widely available now. Hence the constant refrain in this forum - don't put in money you cannot afford to lose.
Where the truth comes to lie has yet to be seen, I hope I've at least convinced you to withhold judgement for a while yet!

Much of the hyperbole around the bend-over-the-government aspect can be discarded right away for two factors: first, most people will happily do what their government tells them (example: fill out their tax returns reasonably properly) and second, because the ecosystem doesn't make avoiding oversight unlikely. For this latter, a motorcycle shop, for instance, has a *nexus* where a Government auditor can show up and see what's going on. 
The danger (for banks and Governments) is in the realm of trade that doesn't have such an easy nexus. Digital goods, for instance, and international trade. It's dangerous because there forms two markets - one old school where transactions in BTC can be monitored and chained to geography, and the other new school where transactions are all but unmonitorable. With two markets we can expect a form of arbitrage as trade leaves the old school market, and goes to the new school, gradually expanding it at the expense of the existing institutions.
For banks, that means a massive loss in revenue from forex and international trade. For Governments, that means a growing loss in revenue from seignorage and unreported income. Over time, that will have consequences. Banks will not be as they are now, although one can expect them to survive in some form, and we can expect them to lobby - and get - rights to substantially raise rates. The loss of (almost) free banking could be expected for lower income participants, which would cause additional problems as they're priced out from the old school market. Governments - even assuming all existing problems are fixed - will be pressured into new and increased taxes on whatever's at hand, taking larger &amp; larger slices of a smaller &amp; smaller pie. Bad news for people who rely on the Government for their livelihood. While some Governments will see this threat at attempt to ban Bitcoin, the nature of the protocol ensures that whichever nations do try this, they will hobble themselves and their people in competing with countries that are more relaxed about it.
Back to your question. The physical tie is to the humans who engage in the ecosystem. The more who do, and to the extent they do, provides the bitcoin both with it's value and informs the curvature of the barrel both banks and Governments will be over.

The problem being solved has to have certain conditions. One is that the problem can be solved inside ten minutes given the power of the network; another is that the problem must be re-soluble both at easier and harder levels depending on people leaving/joining the network.

This seems wrong: a zerocoin cannot itself be spent, but must be converted back into BTC; it might be possible to say 'you just used a zerocoin to get your BTC' and prohibit it on that basis, but it seems unlikely that 'you got this BTC from someone who got it from someone from someone who got it from someone from someone who got it from someone who got it back from a zerocoin' would form the basis of prohibition more easily than 'All BTC are banned!'
Secondly, if businesses are banned from tainted BTC but are allowed untainted BTC, that creates a market for arbitrage between the two which creates an economic disadvantage for whichever state bans it. States can be dumb, but deliberately hobbling oneself without any advantage like a latter day flaggellant extra-dumb

You must not be aware of the traditional solution - hire your family as customers. Restaurants have been doing this for years (I'm led to believe) ... when one of your family opens up a new restaurant, the whole family pitches in to go in and try them out. As much time as they can they take off, and roll up in different clothing at different times of day so everyone passing thinks "Wow! They're popular..."
If I was starting at localbitcoins, that's what I'd do. By using (say) $5k to pay relatives to buy from me, you could get a significant amount of reputation built up without a single 'real' customer, and before running out of that $5k.

Every new block that's created confirms all the transactions before it, so the very earliest blocks will have thousands of confirmations. 
We don't stop the confirmations at 6, because every new confirmation makes it even harder to attack the network. Even if we did stop, it'd not actually save the miners any time or electricity, so there really is nothing to gain by stopping.

Two circumstances off the top of my head: one, either the most desperate of final circumstances where adoption is the other only option left; or (more likely) as competitive advantage vs other nation states.
The aim wouldn't be to kill, but to try to bring the whole idea 'in house'. Seignorage and inflation they agree to be abandon, but national expenses still need to be paid. How about a 'national' cryptocurrency through 'national' exchanges, which can levy a 'national' solidarity tax? Enough of the people love it to make it a goer, making that much harder  to get BTC accepted.

Emotive use of drunk-driving etc aside... I think it was the ancient Greeks who thought good law couldn't be made up, only rediscovered. Expanding beyond that into made up law raises the question: should a community use the law to raise barriers to undesirable behaviour? If a section of the community spend too much time in the bar, is it appropriate to use law to close those bars although the majority would be disadvantaged by that choice? Money Laundering is just such an issue. Would OP change his mind if we can confirm Bitcoin balances as stolen, and many of us refuse to handle coins that have so been stolen? That would be individual choices not to launder money. Peer pressure may well see commercial enterprises also decline to handle stolen money. The final outcome would have the effect, if not the genesis, of law.

No, there'll be a spread of fees: some miners will charge low fees, some will charge more, and the fee you attach to your transaction will have more of a bearing on whether your transaction is completed quickly, or slowly.

IWSTM that your solution sacrifices tolerance for accuracy, which might be good or bad depending on the application.
For Bitcoin, I don't think that's a good trade off. In the existing arrangement 6 confirmations means 99.9% chance of being accurate, every additional confirmation further approaches 100% and in return, the tolerance of malign generals approaches 51% before failure - you've suggested your proposal couldn't tolerate even one, which would seem to impact how fast the blockchain could be extended and *possibly* that a single malign actor could permanently prevent extension.
As a general solution of BGP, I'm not qualified to comment. As a layperson, it seems to me that your proposal would be suitable where there can be guaranteed no malign actors (ie, random problems, as in ethernet) or all of one's own generals could 100% trusted (ie, no traitors)

Two reasons. 
First, trust. You have to trust that the open source model allows for anyone to examine the code behind every single part of the bitcoin standard, and you have to trust that the programmers who implement it (and overlook each other's work) are going to do so honestly. 
Second, experience. You have to consider that if there was a known hole, somebody would have tried to abuse it for personal gain already. There are certainly abusers, but none of the attacks I know about have attacked the standard and led to a known theft.
If neither of the above is good enough, then you'd need to stay away from bitcoin.

It was if my own head was the source of that article! Until the above bit. A strong, centralized, one-world government is not a logical outcome for the same reason there currently *is* no such thing. As politics is war by other means, and all war is local, so all politics is local: power centers look to extend their power even in the presence of dominant force - cf organised crime. At the boundary between one center and the next, in the [march]( a dominant power must necessarily weaken. Any overarching power (cf the many States vs the Federal government these days, the many Lords vs the King in previous) must by necessity be even weaker still such that it holds power only by being able to side with a minority against an undesired majority. Thus: strong, centralized, one-world: history teaches we may choose only two.
The answer to a bitcoiner asking 'Wat do' at a first approximation:
1. Defend your periphery. You are no use to anyone dead, in prison or broke. Discern and learn the rules that will land you on one side or the other, such as in whom you may confide in, how to test your backup regime, how not to be the example chosen *pour encourager les autres*.
2. Extend your periphery. Extend it socially by encouraging your own family to adopt more footloose skillsets, and engaging with others who do the same: being tied to Place will not be an advantage. Extend it financially, as you save against your wife sickness or child's education, and be close enough to others of our kind that you can extend cover to them, as they extend their cover to you. 
3. Be moral, and mandate it with others you let near; hold truth far dearer than profit: it will be even easier to be a liar or a thief in the days to come.

Are we even reading the same page? On the strength of your suggestion I went back and read more. It's about as intellectually dishonest as it can be. Behold:
FTA: "The self-styled “developers” are by and large a bunch of retarded children,"
'Self-styled'. Someone either is, or is not, a developer. Adding 'Self-styled' is a snark that adds nothing to understanding as it doesn't further express why a "self-styled" developer is worse (or even different) than one who is not.
Putting developer into quotes adds nothing to understanding, because again there's nothing added to show any difference from the author's pov between a developer who doesn't have quotes, and one who does.
Putting "by and large" suggests the author has both met a majority of devs (in quotes or otherwise) and has a sufficient relationship with each of them to construct meaningful views as to their personality. I suggest he has not.
"a bunch of retarded children". What would things have to look like for your author to not call them that? Yet again, he doesn't say. The term therefore adds nothing.

Your logic seems flawed from start to end.
1. It's arguable whether total fixed supply is already priced into the cost of bitcoins by virtue of being known by all participants;
2. Ditto whether - if it isn't priced in - that can count either as "inflation" or "tax" in any sense that has yet to make a difference to any decision from here on out;
3. Ditto even assuming all the above, your inflation/tax "cost per transaction" is actually a percentage, not a fixed $10.75 and so makes no difference to future decisions at any price level.
Individual miners can and will charge whatever they like to include individual transactions by means of ignoring transactions with fees they deem 'too low'. People offering too little in fees will not have their transactions entered into the blockchain and will desire to pay more to have that happen. Miners demanding too much will go bust. Fewer miners make it more rewarding for new entrants into the mining business. The spotmarket will therefore decide where that balance is for transactions fees, so your analysis of "1-2% of what miners currently get" is not mathematics, but a guess.
Even assuming your guess of 2% is in fact what will happen, you've confused cause and effect. If the hash rate falls, it will be because it's uneconomic to find miners anywhere on the globe able to mine for that value: they will drop out, so will their hash rate, which will reduce the difficulty, which attracts new miners at the margin, which puts the hash rate back up. 
The aim of the proof-of-work system is to make it just profitable enough to secure the system via mining. Any change to that balance will be market regulated back to normal in fairly short order. As such, any attacker seeking to do double-spending (which is not so much of a problem anyway given one can only double-spend what one has already spent) will discover it would be more profitable to be a miner than a double-spender.

Ho ho ho ... nope. Whether a thing is good, or not, depends on whether it's happening to you, or not. Inflation is terrible for people saving for a home, or their children's education, or their retirement as every year, without fail, inflation will mean handing ~2% of what you've saved straight over to the government. Is the house cheaper? No. Nor's college, nors heating costs. It also forces people to spend now not because they've found something worth investing in, but because they can't find something to invest in and don't expect to find it. Thus, misallocation of capital: as that money is not saved (and so invested), what should have been given to innovation is instead put into eating &amp; drinking.

Yes. We all agree now that it *should* have been honored. But it wasn't. So what should happen about it? You think X. Coinbase think Y. So there is a dispute.

My understanding is that you will not get anything else, not because you don't deserve it, but because that's all the law allows.

I've followed these with much interest! My congratulations on taking on such research. My contribution:
Features and capabilities.
1. Basic web access (ie, can check balances, obtain statements, pay bills via a browser; no need for App based service); 2FA much preferred
2. From a business point of view, it would be tremendously useful to have read-only API access to the account. For instance, a single authenticated call could obtain me a CSV of transactions. I spend too much time finessing data into internal accounting usefulness right now. Ditto balances.
3. Account chaining and servicing. I would like a second account that backs the first such that the second account can hold the bulk of funds. I'd like the first account 'swept' above a certain limit such that those funds go to the second account. I'd like the second account protected such that funds may not be transmitted except to the first account. This is primarily to substantially delay any compromise to the first account emptying that account out.
4. Secure mail to your staff. A mini-webmail system on your site would secure both your bank and me in communicating where necessary.
What I don't want
1. Paper statements etc. Paper*work* I don't mind, but statements and rate change notices are a real nuisance. 
2. A card. I'd retain a local card for withdrawals, etc.

It's not yet practical according to documentation: 
According to rumor, it's not yet practical either. I'm not a cryptographer but I know people who are and I understand the problem with QCs is not that a QC can't find an answer, but the humans aren't yet able to discern which answer provided is the correct one - to the extent it remains easier to brute force finding a key.
Additionally, if QCs were capable of breaking bitcoin's cryptography today, it would not be used for such as to do so would reveal the presence of tech that can be used to listen in on foreign goverment communications. I bet the any Govt would let Bitcoin thrive rather than reveal that capability.
And last of all, if QC can break Bitcoin's crypto, it can break practically all crypto being used by banks etc worldwide -- securing Bitcoin will be the least of our worries.

Attacker's attack must therefore discover six consecutive blocks before any of the other 49% discovers the first block, otherwise it must restart, surely? That would seem to considerably confine the window of opportunity.


Attacker's attack is therefore no larger than his existing spend to the exchange, surely? That rather confines the value of the opportunity.


And the [wiki]( says that might be tricky to unravel, although I have more faith.
But also, as the wiki says, the attacker would make more money from playing by the rules. That said, having your Bitcoins held by someone else is always going to be riskier than looking after them properly yourself.

False. A buyer is not mandated to purchase in any way but that most in line with their requirement vis-a-vis protection, including the use of reputation facilities (including place of jursidiction, online review from other purchasers and escrow). Likewise a seller who doesn't perform per contract stands to lose substantial built-up reputation and therefore future revenue.

This bit is wrong.

By the time bitcoin actually threatens the US Dollar, it'll be too late - if anything'll happen, it'll have to happen long before. For instance, if 10% of trade happens in BTC instead of USD, where would the tax revenue come from to wage the War on BTC? That 90% will have to migrate to BTC purely to avoid the inflation USD would experience as tax receipts dropped but outgoings stayed in place.

Sure! Although you might not like what I have to say.
1. I don't accept your implication that we should entice people "who are skeptical" to join in. Only time will bring them onside, and they'll use any adverse problem beforehand (flash crash, fraud) to spread the word about how BTC screwed their life over. It's too early for them, and too early for us to have them.
2. Nor do I think we should entice people who you say "can't afford" BTC. Every other post rightly warns people to only put in money they can afford to lose. The security aspect is not yet right for those kinds of people: maybe when they can get a card and so directly comprehend: lose the card, lose the money. Right now, most people who can't afford BTC will not understand how to secure their BTC (&gt;implying those who can afford BTC themselves understand how to secure it)
3. I am a programmer (since the late 70s), and I believe I know alot about how ordinary people interact with tech (as I now fix people's home machines for a living, perfect balance of reward and not-seeing-the-same-people-every-day!) so I believe I've insight into both the social *and* the technical side of Bitcoin:
3a. The idea of a percentage fee is repellent from a cypherpunk position -- see my phone call analogy above. It will take *alot* of effort to get people to accept **huge** markups on large transactions in order to bring the possible scale of transaction down a bit. At heart, percentage fees would be forced redistribution. BTC should not have this built in. If redistribution is desirable, it should be done elsewise: for instance, put together a merchant guild, where they will provide valuable services (such as escrow, contract dispute resolution) in return for yearly subscriptions (which can be redistributed.) This has a real-life example in the [Livery Companies]( except such a guild could be geographically unlimited.
3b. The idea of a fee based in a fiat currency is repellent from a user point of view. Why USD? What if the USD crashes (and so American users are disadvantaged as it becomes more expensive to transact?) or a foreign currency crashes (and so it becomes more expensive for them to trade with Americans, reducing what the American might potentially earn?) The protocol should be independent of other currencies, but even if not it just becomes an additional source of confusion, consternation and risk from someone who just wants to buy in goods or services.
3c. Lastly, I think the real killer would be that this causes a coin fork. With the source openly available, those who disagreed with your (considerably) higher fees would immediately bail for a coin that doesn't levy them, be it litecoin or whatever. Worse, the big transactions might bail on their own, and all that's left behind are the smaller transactions you're trying to help with a subsidy that must climb and climb as it's levied on fewer and fewer participants. 
I think your suggestion is well-intentioned, but it looks to me like you're essentially trying to shoe-horn a political agenda - soaking the rich via their big transactions to subsidise the poor via their small transactions - into the bitcoin ecosystem. You'll get alot of adherents (particularly those who play at satoshidice, so you'll be subsidising gambling!) but ultimately it won't work -- the protocol is not the place to implement the world you want to see.

Bold assumption is wise!
This is a pretty standard investment scenario. He wants to pay you 0.09 BTC for the right to spend your 1 BTC. He believes he can make 1.30 BTC. You get your 1 BTC back, so you're happy. You get 0.09 for doing without ofr 3 months, so you're even happier. He has the use of your 1 BTC, so he has more than he otherwise would. He makes 0.21 BTC, so he's happy too. He gets more than you because he's taking a risk on the 'something' above. You get less than him because you've accepted a guaranteed return. At 1 BTC, if he calls his 'something' wrong, he would pay you the 0.09 BTC out of his own money. Everyone should end up happy. 
You ask the con (by which I suspect you mean "contra", rather than "confidence trick".) Your con is the opportunity loss you accept by going without 1 BTC for three months. It is also the risk you'll get nothing back at all and never here from this guy again.
What's the something? It could be as simple as a hope that he can borrow your 1 BTC, and sell it when it next goes 20% higher. He would then rebuy when the price afterwards drops to the current price. That is, speculation. It could also be an actual investment, such as he wants a BTC to help pay a BTC-earning webdev, and he hopes the webdev will make a site that earns him the BTC back. It could also be he doesn't care - he has BTC that are stolen, and he'll "pay" 0.09 BTC to launder it clean. It could be wants to build a reputation as a good Bitcoin borrower. Research is proper, if you want to show you did due diligence.

They don't do it for a wide variety of reasons. First, the Bitcoin price isn't high enough: If they needed to transfer $10 million from New York to Tokyo, they'd need 11,200 bitcoins. Assuming they have 11,200BTC, they'd need someone in Tokyo prepared to give them $10 million worth of Yen in exchange for it. Do you have $10 million around to buy BTC? I don't. So they're relying on enough Bitcoin economy activity in Japan to support sufficient numbers of people who would all have $10 million in savings just waiting to buy bitcoins.
A second reason is that while they're transferring the $10 million, they can't use the bitcoins for anything else -- so they're also limited in how much they could transfer in a day.

Deflation is rare, never mind hyperdeflation, as contrasted to inflation. I take from that it'd be unwise as yet to say what deflation will lead to, only what it might lead to. As nobody's forced me to join the Bitcoin economy, it's a risk I'm happy to take on in order to learn what *actually* happens.




Those contentions are not mutually exclusive. 


This I also disagree with. Saving has a value of it's own, 'hoarding' is exactly the same thing as far as the rest of the economy is concerned however in a real life economy as we have, saving is considered bad, and is punished (at 2.5% inflation pa). Is and should saving be bad? There are those who suggest the consumption-based economy we have is less desirable than a production-based economy predicated on deflation. I've not got the background to assess whether deflation does necessarily mean producers will have to work alot harder than before (and I suspect no-one does, give the paucity of deflationary economies) to the extent that consumers can relax a bit, but this is about choice - we can, and I suspect will, find out. Group A can play with fiat, Group B can opt out.


Where we'll have to disagree. Bitcoin has successfully functioned as a store of value by virtue of not being abandoned, identical to fiat's function as a store of value for the same reason.

The price of bitcoins has fallen 94% before, only to recover and well exceed the previous high, so I don't think the oldies here are unduly troubled by a 'mere' 25%.

Your strategy doesn't work in a trending market: and bitcoins have trended up for most of the year; it only works in a ranging market (the price covers a range from $700 upto $900, down again, up again...). But as soon as it breaks those ranges you're either left holding cash because it never went low enough again to buy in, or high enough again to sell out. Further, the ranging only works if the range is sufficiently wide: you'll have transaction fees to pay which will eat into your profits.

And the more you engage, the more trustable you'll be. To the extent you're not, that will rapidly become obvious to all.

Maybe you missed the bit where all the Avalon miners have left the market? The mining rate is the same, but the chance of those miners left finding a block has increased.
If there's 100 miners with identical equipment, each miner has a 1% chance of finding a block. 
If 50 miners leave, the remaining 50 miners have twice the chance of finding a block -- 2%.
At 5 miners, each has 20%. At 4 miners, 25%. At 2 miners, 50%.
If 99 miners leave, the 1 miner left has a 100% chance of finding the block.

Certainly high, "unacceptably" is subjective, especially in the light of the several bank account confiscations Europe has seen in recent times.


I have no problem with that at all. Should the bitcoin experiment succeed, perhaps federal reserve notes and their equivalents could end as a residual form to be bought on the spot market at the best possible moment in order to satisfy those taxes. At the point you suggest though, Gresham's Law would apply and at that point, it will not favor Uncle Sam's dollars.


Then he's doing a poor job - fully one third the purchasing power of the dollar has been lost in the last decade; 90% of it has been lost in 60 years. This on the Government's own figures; there's reason to believe the purchasing power loss is actually greater than that. We would assert *a choice* not to use the dollar with any but Uncle Sam and those others who would prefer it. 


I'm on record here as putting it out *at least* five years. You clearly know traditional money better than I, so you will know of the European Unit of Account from the 1970s.

Let's also say that if he slaps the price a bit up, a bit down, a bit up and so forth, and notices that it reduces other people's transactions by 40%. *That's* useful knowledge, as it suggests 60% of the market are bots. Do it on and off throughout the day and you can detect when is best to trade against humans vs against bots. Trade against bots and you can flash crash people out of their stops. The more bots, the better that'll work.

Your client can be made to believe the blockchain is in whatever state the attacker chooses. For instance, that you have no more bitcoins, or more bitcoins than you in fact have, or that you have never had any. The attacker might thereby hope to induce you to behave (or refrain from behaving) in a certain manner, perhaps in combination with other attacks ("Icarus! Major security breach to be announced tomorrow morning, SELL your shiat NOW!!")
I doubt that a particular attacker would have a specific interest in focusing on particularly attacking *you* which is what the above would imply, but you did ask about the security :-)
I'll add a second, much more general answer: by using a 'selfish' client when you could have used a normal client, you've extracted value from the network without contributing back to it, thus lowering the security for everyone else. This is a similar issue to refusing immunization shots for your children - you're relying on other people not having the disease to protect your child, you're relying on other people protecting the network to protect your client. That said, you've also *added* to the network by expanding the number of potential users. These are extremely early days, and lite clients are very, very desirable and should be thought of as mandatory in the future - the value of an NFC credit card sized lite client is obvious.
If you can use a normal client, I'd encourage it.

They already do. For every hardcore bible-thumping fundy who has 1 Gibibyte of photos of him and his missus Praising The Lawd, those photos will contain - on average - ***64*** different sequences of the number '666'. That's not even including BCD encoding! So clearly, byte patterns are not enough the work of the devil as to be a source of concern.
From the point of strict legal liability, courts will want to see more than possession of the blockchain before they convict. They'll want to see visits to the websites concerned, credit card numbers used to buy, etc etc.
I can imagine someone trying to attack Bitcoin by huffing and puffing about what is or isn't in the blockchain. A few might stop using it in favor of dollars that Jesus hand-crafted himself, but most won't hear of the attack, and the rest will be "meh"

You mean "widely suspected" because there's been no recent history of a what happens in the absence of actual or potential government manipulation of currency.


Less growth is likely - this is true - because the current system borrows from the future in order to consume now. That is clearly not sustainable. A system that better protects sustainability vs less growth is arguably desirable. No?
More volatility, less efficiency: these look like comments around the effect *on the fiat system* not the Bitcoin system. Just as buggy-whip makers experienced volatility and reduced efficiency, those relying on fiat may experience the same. The world moved on.
Increased poverty is not likely IMHO, looking globally. As I would suggest that Bitcoin (extending the effect of technology generally) means more jurisdictions rather than fewer, and smaller jurisdictions are more responsive to their taxpayers. If this is so, this increases equality between jurisdictions as they compete for better taxpayers. Jurisdictions that are careless about inequality would find it harder to attract / hold taxpayers.

If they *do* spend them, then they no longer have 25% *and* it's expanded the market ... again, meh.

There are two different subjects to "Crypto-currency". Cryptography is all about transferring information from one place to another even in the presence of a malign actor who may very well be the courier who transfers the message. (Or transferring information through time - shifting that data securely at any rate.) Cryptography can exist without cryptocurrencies.
Cryptocurrencies layer on top of cryptography in the sense that they don't add anything to cryptography itself. There's nothing new about Bitcoin - or any other cryptocurrency that adds to cryptography in the same way that Ford and Volvo don't add anything major to our understanding of the wheel. They do, however, come up with novel uses *for* cryptography.
This careful division of cryptocurrency and cryptography is to introduce that I don't think there are sources that deal with both, particularly as Cryptocurrencies as we now understand them are extremely new: there's not really been the time for books to be written.
You've got my recommendation for cryptography; for the cryptocurrency side have a look at the [Bitcoin whitepaper](

This will not happen in quite the way you think. Some services the nation state provides are, actually, valuable: as an example, think of the courts system. In a completely competitive environment the taxes charged by each jurisdiction will fall to the point where people feel they are getting their money's worth, but no further. Any higher, and taxable entities leave in search of a home somewhere cheaper. Any lower, and the services will be too poor and taxable entities leave in search of a home somewhere more expensive, but nicer.
This reduces the scale at which government is viable, so you'd end up with more city states like Singapore and Hong Kong. This would also have the benefit of making it easier to 'vote with your feet' by moving a dozen few miles down the road to a different jurisdiction -- a novelty in Europe in a way American's might not appreciate.

The disparity between the exchange prices include reflecting that it can take some months to actually extract the fiat from high price exchanges, in order to buy at low price exchanges.
For instance, there were some reports that MtGox are taking 22 months to send you fiat. Even if that was 2.2 months, it would likely ruin your attempt at arbitrage.

If you buy a small amount every few hours over the next few days you'll get very close to the average price for that period. This is called dollar cost averaging. He couldn't ask for more.
As for 100, there'd need to be close to $7 million dollars worth dumped to get that far, and there's only about ~~$0.1~~ $1 million dollars worth being traded a day right now, so no reason to think it'd get down that far from normal trading.

Way too early to see Govt action. More likely someone has had a word with someone at a University, and now some undergrads are seeing what they can learn. If it appears to work, then they'd get hired in. If it doesn't, well, it was only money. Either way, this isn't yet The Happening.
The various hacks that are going on are the real world equivalent of wandering around with thousands of dollars in a wallet balanced on top of your head - it takes very little to rob such people. It's much more likely that the computerati with broken moral compasses are doing exactly that.

A better example would be somebody trying to spend the same coins twice. In order to work out which coins are the real coins, we look at which of the pair have the most confirmations. The one with the most confirmations are the real coins, the other ones are not. So if we stop at 6, and both sets of coins have 6 confirmations, are both to be treated as real? 
Instead we track all confirmations. If one set has 1000 confirmations, and the other has 999, then the first set are real and the second are not (these numbers are **very** unlikely to happen!)

They have done that - the hash tables are known as "rainbow tables". Look up the hash that matches the one you've caught, and read off the password.
If a "salt" is added though - as here - the attacker would need one complete rainbow table for every possible salt. A 4 byte salt, for instance, would mean the attacker needs 4,294,967,295 rainbow tables. Bandwidth and space is cheap, but they aren't yet cheap enough.

To cash out means to sell them at an exchange, either the formal ones like MtGox or BitStamp, or informal ones like at a localbitcoin or satoshi square meet up. The risk of something going wrong is lower at the former, but it can take considerably more time to see the fiat. The sidebar (right of this page on full sized computers) has suggestions.
A portfolio is a range of different investments. Preferably they would have been so chosen as to provide cover for each other: if one goes down, the others would go up. (Grossly simplified though!) Once you have your fiat instead of bitcoins, you would ask your question again in a subreddit where you're likely to get a better answer, such as One word of warning though: my understanding is that the costs of buying into lots of different investments means it may be too costly to start with just a couple thousand dollars.

Strawman is a man made of straw.
1. For companies that already use effectively instant verification (such as MacDonalds), there's already a certain amount of fraud going on with counterfeit currency. It's a cost of business they're happy with in fiat, it's likely to be they're happy with it in BTC, and would control for it in the same way.
2. For companies that don't use effectively instant verification in fiat (such as buying a house, gotta count all those Benjamins), there's no real difference in waiting an hour for full BTC verification as to what's already done.
3. For companies that can't or won't accept either of the above, services can be layered on top of the BTC technology to provide instant verification. If the market wants it, the market'll get it. No need to change the verification times.

They don't need 'legal proof' whatever you think that is: Courts need proof, the Police only need 'suspicion', and Yes They Can. Here's how: the police have the power (with a warrant) to enter a house to arrest a named person in connection with an offence. They've got a named person and an address (they were written on the intercepted package) and they have one or more offences (someone using the Royal Mail to transport and possibly receive narcotics). Sure, they've got a fake name, but they don't yet know it. They get a warrant and in they come, and in comes the drug pooch too. Despite turning everything over, they can't find Mr Fake Name but what's that? The drug pooch has indicated on drugs anyway? They now suspect *you*, because you are there, and there's no evidence of Mr Fake Name. So you got arrested, your computer seized, and the case against you built from there.
That they don't do this at all often is not evidence they *can't* do it, which is what you seem to be saying. Perhaps quantities below a certain level are not even bothered with - there are bigger things to worry about.

The BTC are actually stored in the blockchain, a file which all exchanges, all miners and many if not most people have a copy of, including you if you've let -qt do its bigass download. The wallet merely represents which part of the blockchain is yours. Thus: if you have two wallets in different places, both wallets can spend the coins, similar to if you and your wife have a joint account.
Now: if you have an offline wallet, you will *usually* have a different wallet to the exchange, rather than a copy, in which case 1 BTC in your offline wallet, and your exchange wallet will say "1 BTC was sent to .... Balance: 0 BTC"

AIUI, performance would be when they sent you the first or all of your coins, though I could be wrong. The situation is similar to hiring a guy to paint your house for $500. He never arrives, so you get your $500 back. If he started to paint, then *that's* performance and so you'd have a case.

Things have been screwed since at least 2008 - world war 2 started and ended faster than this. I would also say things were not much better for alot longer beforehand because much of the 'growth' claimed back then was actually house price bubble driven - thanks to Governments massively subsidising it. Without proper price signals who's to tell whether things are good or bad? And if we can't tell, who's going to invest? Government mismanagment of the markets has badly degraded economies around the world.

A clarification would be good - it did seem jarring to interpret that as I did given the good tone of the rest of the text.
I try not to be "averse to any and all regulation", it's clear to my libertarian side that the interface between the two economies will see preferred regulations on different sides - such is always the case where power centers meet. What I'd particularly like is different power centers enabling jurisdictional shopping. However, that's outside the bounds of Dion's paper. I hope he follows it up, because the nature of the Bitcoin economy is that US laws and regulations can no longer live in a vacuum and that may force them to be modified.

Assuming a miner adds it, then it goes into the blockchain like any other. The question is, do you still have the private key that goes with it? If you don't, then the coins are there but not recoverable by you or anyone. If you do still have the private key, then you'll see it come up in your client.
To answer your example: whether Satoshi Circle recognizes it depends on whether they've kept that private key around.

There's someone big at BitStamp who's been steadily offloading significant amounts for some days now, and that's been keeping the price down. At the moment he's at 118.45. I suspect it's one person because tall walls appear at once - they don't build up as one person moves then others join in. Check out the 3h chart:  and you'll see him at one level, and whenever anyone else wanting to sell comes along, they briefly drop the price until it bounces along the ceiling again.
MtGox looks rather more algorithmic, especially at the 12h level.

Lifting the barrier to entry is a bad thing. Transferwise meant it was as cheap to get £10 into BTC, as it was £200. It *looks* like HSBC (for instance) have a £30 minimum fee to MtGox, and £9 minimum fee to BitStamp, meaning people sending less than £300 and £100 are having to pay much more. (I've not investigated alternatives yet, so those numbers may be out.)
It would be useful if the existing exchanges (or a new entrant) put together an open source business model such that the software and manual processes needed to create an exchange were much easier to come by -- with that, I think we'd see them pop up all over the shop.
I disagree that early adopters necessarily have a massive market share, and even if they did, that it represents a threat as they could only lose out. 
They're easily manipulated, that's true. But these are very early days - I don't see BTC being a major thing in society until closer to 2019. Manipulation will be very different then!

Sure, although remember these were consequences of fleeter money (as bitcoins are) as well as other factors such as wider access to proper computing (which is what smartphones are, unknown back then.)
A good pair was that there would be a greater number of jurisdictions (as indeed has happened) involving both nation states and city states. We have seen Scotland and Wales gain greater sovereignty with the UK in that time, for instance, and both Hong Kong &amp; Macau as cities. And with a greater number of jurisdictions being forced to bid both for rare funds and rare talent, you'd see greater equality between them even as you saw greater inequality *within* them.

Quite a few flaws in there, but it's good you've tried to think what the bad guys might do.


With multi-sigs, you can *choose to need* any 2 of 3, or you'll still be able to use the 1 private key. You can't be compelled to choose either.


They could not block you from doing so, because all accounts outside the US would be 'unregistered' and so blocking transfers to unregistered accounts *instantly* stops all United States trade with the rest of the world. As Americans can't buy anything foreign, you'll see prices quadruple as exorbitant privilege falls away followed quickly by layoffs by the hundreds of thousands as employment crashes.


No. Aldo has a registered account in NY. He 'buys' something from his cousin Vinnie in Italy, thus making a legitimate international transfer. Vinnie sends the bitcoin straight back to his Cousin Aldo's unregistered account. 
The cost of implementing the scheme you describe would be very, very heavy; the cost if subverting it: $0. It would be a farce.

I believe this to be wrong (or my understanding of what you meant is wrong.)  [Consider these adverts]( to accept the Streisand Effect doesn't apply to merchants is to assert some virgin soul has never seen such an advert and become aware that copying is possible. The adverts even hint at how to obtain a copy: disk to disk, secreted camera in theater, etc.


It's easy to put a law on the books then say it's enforced - just look at patents. It's hard to put a law on the books and then actually enforce it - just look at copying (microcasettes, video tapes, whatever). Given the size of the black market in the United States is thought to be around 10% of GDP, I suggest that "censoring and enforcing at the individual level" will see a response closer to that of the black market rather than a response that leads a government to validly claim any success (although I'm sure they would anyway.)
~~Just as a thought experiment: if we argue that the US "tolerates" a certain size of black market ("manage" might be better; in any case, doesn't treat the problem as a existential threat), Bitcoins would need to hit around $1250 each to become the same order of problem.~~ What a load of cobblers.

1. Percentage (%) follows the number in common English use: "1.000%" not "%1.000"

Most people will put up a sell at a specific number, like 115.00, so much so that if the price briefly rises to 115.00, not everyone selling there may be able to actually sell. By dropping just very slightly to 114.99, the seller is increasing the chance that he can sell at the risk of losing 1 cent for every 114.99 he does manage to sell, as 114.99 will be honoured first.
The same thing happens on the way down, at 114.01 vs 114.00 for instance. Nothing to worry about, just people trying to "queue jump"

This attack bears further analysis!
The attack doesn't kill the market, but if successfully executed would shake out weak hands, and so would lift the psychological bar to use and thus weaken BTC. On the flip side, it could only be successfully executed a very few times, and here's my logic. 
1. The market is too volatile now: with few participants to be scared off, the value of an attack now is questionable. 
2. When there's enough participants from the 'real' economy, successive attacks would obtain diminishing returns: successive attacks have fewer weak hands to shake out; each time exchanges would be motivated to reveal trading patterns and so an 'attack' could be eventually be detected in real time, or voluntary circuit breakers put in place. Thus, the exchanges and the economy behind them become inured to the attack. 
3. Such an attack, consciously or not, will rotate around a particular fiat price other than zero. Those who buy under that price stand to make quite a bit of BTC. While this could include the attacker, it would also include a lot of people wanting to exchange in. This basically legitimated the floor level that the attacker wants or can get: if the Uncle Sam's floor is $2000/BTC (or $2/BTC), that's *news*. We would understand that as 'the biggest whale in the market believes the value is ...'  So, successive attacks would find more and more buying in at that level, much reducing its effectiveness. 
4. Consider that if one attacker is a sovereign (like the US), other sovereigns might object to the attack as it would directly harm it's own citizens and interests: China, for instance could buy up every last BTC the US dumped. Attack neutralised. Come to think of it, almost any small country or city-state could seriously help defend the price level for their own citizens. Now needing others to stand aside, the attacker must reveal himself, and so his plans. Right now, the US cannot even keep Russia out of Georgia or themselves into Syria, so their chances of being hegemon over Bitcoin is very, very low. 
So! I think the attack you posited could happen but had an escalating probability of failure at each attempt. 
Thank you for the brain food!

No it isn't, and I'll explain why. 
1. This articles was posted by the FT. The FT, the owners of the FT, and the staff of the FT all hate the Internet, absolutely loathe it. Have a look through the history books for what happened to "Fleet Street" and you'll learn why newspapers, broadcast television, cable TV and so forth all would happily see the Internet dead in order to restore the incredible amounts of money they were making and kudos they were obtaining before the Internet came along. That this is still their attitude can be demonstrated as easily as asking "Do they have an instant paywall?" The Times and Sky TV do, the BBC does too ("this content not available in your country!") By extension, anything the Internet does better is a reason for giving the Internet a kicking. If you want the most unbiased material, head on over to the Economist, not the FT.
2. Look at who said what. The quote you're looking at is this one: "Also under consideration was the idea of creating a regulated exchange, which would be the world’s first." Notice that there are no quotes around it in the original, meaning that *these are only the words of the journalist*. You are meant to think it was HMRC, as they were quoted in the preceding paragraph. But they didn't say it - the journalist did.
3. Even if the journalist is quoting the "Revenue", she can't be arsed to identify *who* at the Revenue did the quoting so other people can double-check what was said.
4. Check out the chart posted there. With 2.5 years worth of bitcoin history, it makes the recent action look far more dramatic than it has been. She (although I'm sure her article is shit because she's a shit journalist, not because she's a She) could have chosen to do the chart from 12 months ago and it would have started at more or less the same place, yet look less dramatic. Why do you think she either chose not to, or what do you make of her journalism skills that her boss didn't trust her to do it?
5. Let's assume an unidentifiable someone representing the UK did say that an exchange is to be created. Why on earth are you believing him? Just because he said it? 
6. Even if the UK was going to create an exchange, when - in HMG's history - has it ever managed to get an IT project done properly?
tl;dr: you've let your excitement get carried away because of shit journalism and insufficient cynicism.

Don't fooled by this argument. 
There are places in the world such as Russia where energy can be bought for 14% the price it costs in the USA. There are places and technologies where the price would approach effectively free: solar near the Sahara, for instance, and hot springs in Iceland. 
It's expected that as the cost of energy for mining goes up, those kinds of places will start to see more miners reflecting their lower electricity costs.

Bitcoin disintermediates in financial transactions and so, to the extent trade happens wholly online, governments will be unable to add a sales tax, nor benefit from seignorage. This threatens revenue, and therefore government 'as you know it'.

It would certainly increase the value of everyone's bitcoins if the US government accepted it. 
But they cannot accept it, because everyone would dump their dollars to buy them because inflation, and once the price stabilized, the US government would be unable to print more of them, and so US government debt would explode. The US would then have to abandon dollars (and so dollar debt) altogether and tell the world to F*** themselves about what they're owed, so would be unable to borrow more, would be unable to print more, would be unable to mine more, and would be severely constrained about raising BTC taxes. Medicare and medicaid -- indeed the entire welfare and warfare state -- would have to be abandoned (lots of seniors and warriors without their money!) in order to only spend what they tax. 
So yes - accepting it would be good for BTC, but they're not going to do it. I'd bet one of the city-states will do it first (Hong Kong, Singapore, etc)

By asserting that a reduction in verification would see that "transactions are cleared faster" and that "the verification of a block is becoming more and more expensive, at least in terms of consumed electricity. This might also be improved by reducing verification duration" you were coloring your question in the manner of a spin doctor.

The implication that 1 BTC Is not enough is itself wrong. First, 1 BTC can currently be divided into 100,000,000. With a simple change, it could be make essentially infinitely divisible - enough for everyone. Second, whoever owned the rest does not benefit from it because he cannot earn interest from it, and if he spends it, then he cannot buy 'everything' because as so a he disposes of some part of it, the remainder of that money drops in value so he finds his money buys very little.

Kinda: you are buying BTC for fiat at the regulated exchange, then sending that BTC to your account at an offshore exchange. With future transactions, for non-Americans, the gains made at the second exchange are tax-free until the money is repatriated, which may be never. Americans need to dance more lightly as - in common with Ethiopians - they are taxed on worldwide income - everyone else is only taxed on income made nationally.

It could be better -- it'd be preferable that if log in is 2FAd, withdrawal and sec.cen would also be 2FAd the same way if not already.
It *looks* like the intention is that login, withdrawal and sec.cen could all have their own separate 2FA systems for entry, perhaps as a means of extremely simple role-based security (Alice can login, review and buy; Bob can login, review, buy and withdraw; Carol can login, review, buy and withdraw and exclude Alice and Bob through use of sec.cen) all through the same account.
That said, a newb might consider that neither withdrawal nor sec.cen could be accessed without 2FA for login and think he doesn't need to do (or doesn't realize he's being offered) the other two. At first blush that ought not to be a problem unless the API is also allowed access. As I said -- could be better.

@_date: 2013-03-31 22:00:12
I think you're wrong about both.
A. The Roman empire made it punishable by death if you abandoned your farm to avoid collecting very high taxes from people on your land, and handing it in to Rome, (Yet they were so desperate for tax revenue, people who were caught abandoning their land were immediately returned to it to collect those taxes. Forced land ownership, effectively, was your punishment!) This is to note that the punishment, howsoever large, will not be enough. 
As a side issue, I can believe that for many there will be a 'white' economy of a certain amount of declared transactions. Enough to look like good citizens so the auditors look for lower-hanging fruit. But much more than currently will move into the 'black' economy of undeclared transactions, *particularly* with families who are effectively international. Parents in Ireland, son  in Oz, pair of daughters in CA for example. The purchases can be shuffled around the family for best advantage. 
This does mean that poorer families, who do not have the international presence, will be disadvantaged vis a vis their relationship with taxing authorities.
What the public, banks or corporates want is immaterial.
B. Time verification is not an issue down the line: I contract with company A to provide escrow services, you contract with company B. Company A and B know each other through a reputation protocol C. Thus, I can offer to buy something from you and you *instantly* know I'm good for it via your App. Instant credit check, if you will.

One suggestion. 
1. POP:3000 suggests someone has a general store. That someone in general store to maintain a computer at and through which the tech non-savvy can transact in BTC. (Similar to how isolated townships handled money when out of contact with the rest of the country.)
2. Contacts made with several in the diaspora who are capable of transacting BTC for fiat. As and when needed, general store can arrange for BTC to such a contact, that contact can convert BTC into fiat (perhaps at an ATM), that contact can then arrange for fiat-denominated bills external to the village to be paid. This solves for taxes, electrics etc where the counterparty will not accept BTC.

Among other things I'm a developer (although I prefer Ajax, PHP, PostgreSQL for online stuff, and either C++ or Python for offline stuff.) RoR I've looked into as something that clearly has a tremendous amount of 'eyes' look at it, so it makes it far faster to develop with it.

VCs don't get out of bed for any project under $10mil US, so it I'm suspicious right off the bat: what about your site would be worth so much? Surely not advertising. It could be they're interested in how you handle payments. It could be they'd like to copy your business model. It could just be they want to know how much of a threat you might be to an identical product their 'partner' wants to launch ("He says no lawyers on board? Phew!")
So, I'm suspicious about what they're after rather than who they are; I'm assuming here you've checked that out.
If they just want some free info on how your stuff works, offer it, or don't. If they're looking to make an investment consider that you would mean you no longer control the site (or your life) in the way you might want. 
I would suggest that you call someone you know who has run businesses IRL, ring them up and ask to lay out what's happening to see what they say. If you don't know someone, find someone you do know who can introduce you to someone *they* know. I'm thinking that with a conversation like that, you'd be in a stronger position to identify where the potential with your site is. As soon as money enters the frame you *must* get advice.

Your analysis is flawed. There's no such thing as a "standard denomination" is probably where it starts, but while you're right that Bitcoins could be divided into trillions of units, the size of the economy using Bitcoins could not: the value of a Bitcoin would eventually be determined by the finite size of that economy divided by the finite number of Bitcoins available - and that would always be a finite (and eventually stable, we hope) value.

1 cent US is currently 4,405 satoshi; all the world's money is 'worth' 8.3 trillion dollars US. That's suggest an ultimate upper bound for BTC at about $395,000 each, beyond which it couldn't go. If that comes to pass, 1 cent US will still be about 2.5 satoshis each.

The downsides are with respect to security only - an additional way for thieves to act. 
If by 'export' you mean 'backup', that's not necessary: the design means you can make 100 transactions between backups before you should backup again.

No problem. Just because an address has bitcoins in it, does not mean those bitcoins are spendable. Examples:

* the wallet may have been lost in an accident ([like with this guy](
* the owner might be dead;
* the address might be real, but by complete fluke someone has never created the private key to match it: it can receive bitcoins, but no-one is able to send them on.

If the wallet was not itself encrypted, it could have been copied off your machine by malware and reused by whomever got hold of it. If it *was* encrypted, it could still have been copied off your machine, along with a copy of the common passwords that machine knows about (for websites, wireless, etc etc) and all of them could be tried. If it had its very own password, chances are the password was a weak one and was easily guessed - computers can guess passwords well into the tens of thousands per second.

Depends on the scale of the DDoS, but I take your point.
Do you mean HTML has the overhead? HTML over HTTP can itself be lightweighted (if your forgive the verb!) by using RESTful access, for instance: the signal to noise ratio of using json to pass data back and forth is very much lighter on bandwidth and server. That would seem to make the client heavier in weight though, so perhaps I understand you wrong.

I don't think you're off base, but I think also you're limiting your expectations to what Western Governments will do. France, Germany, the United States will all behave as you say, by rejecting it. I suspect the UK won't, or will do so begrudgingly, or will even publicly ban but privately tolerate it, because of the role of the City of London -- they'd want to be the first, biggest center. 
However, not all Governments are Western, or beholden to voters, and many can barely control their own Capitals, never mind the hinterland, much less what happens in cyberspace: Singapore springs to mind, African nations likewise. With income becoming more equal between jurisdictions, one might think they would seek to attract the use of Bitcoins locally. Would the US attempt war on them all to enforce a No Bitcoin policy? I think not.

Look ahead, not behind: on OSX, Time Machine will make backups of the wallet going back in time. Then the user changes the password. The time machine backup is stolen but, *the wallets in it still have the old password*. The average user (ie, not us) does not expect that behaviour. Look how many people get fraped because their friends know/guess their password - imagine what it'll be like with wallets in every dorm! Malware is a tiny threat right now, although you're right it affects Windows more. On Linux, there's not even the option of mandatory time machine like behavior, so lose the wallet and it's gone completely. Hence my point: using Bitcoin on *any* OS can be risky.

You've pretty much listed why Bitcoin is a huge risk, right now.
For mainstream appeal, I suspect we'll find opensourced cryptodevices not unlike the Trezor, perhaps creditcard sized; this would be the natural endgame from having iphone/android apps on phones. Such a device would need manufacturing so we'd be waiting on that; it could also need to be thicker to accommodate battery, &amp; camera. A big complexity is that possession of the keys is conclusive evidence of ownership, not possession of the card: to get round that might require using TPM ... and the open source community doesn't like TPM.
That said, is it necessarily desirable that the plebs get an idiot-proof means of holding BTC just yet? There are bigger problems to deal with than letting John and Jane Doe pay for their mochas with BTC when they have no real interest in BTC themselves.

I'm not suggesting a card could be spoofed - where one gets copied off - rather, that a whole new set of cards with different internals are made; the attacker is in control of those internals, and writes it such that it behaves identical to a real card. Preload it with a couple thousand keys generated on the attacker's computer.
To the user, it looks exactly like a proper card. When using it, it behaves exactly like a proper card. Only when the attacker chooses, does the funds it was thought to contain vanish.

If you ordered SC60s, you should get SC60s, so I agree with that: on reflection I'd refund you the difference between 12xSC60 and 12xSC50 going by price on the date of sale. I think the SC50 being within +/-10% is taking a liberty with the facts.

I think very, and for two reasons:
1. Cryptographic cracking doesn't happen in a rush, but usually gradually, with successive theories chipping away at the bit length. Consider MD5: introduced 1992, theoretical flaws found in 1995, practical breaking in 2005. The thought is "we'd see it coming."
2. If the NSA could break SHA-256, they would not reveal that fact to the world by breaking Bitcoin - it's more valuable to them to break foreign government encryption. As a practical thing then, for now we could behave "as if" it wasn't broken.

I'm no cryptographer, but that does suggest a lower limit of randomness that is necessary, and implicity that more randomness could be used - and so some applications (such as TC?) might try to obtain additional randomness 'just to be sure'.

There's no danger of hitting either in the short term, nor is there an architectural reason why either matter -- the 64bit limit is 8192Pb.

Sorry, the article wasn't clear to me as to that point.
There's no direct way to tell whether the BTC-11.02 has been moved on by the DEA, or the original owner, or any 3rd party for that matter. If the DEA have a published public address that they moved on to, that would be a good indirect measure - although I'm not aware of one. 
To answer your question, it may be the authorities maintain a 'fund' of BTC: should the coins be claimed back, that fund would be the source rather than seeing the original coins returned (similar to how seized dollars being returned are not necessarily the actually seized original dollars. The value being the same, any court would be happy.) In this way, the DEA mixing the coins onwards might be useful (from their point of view) to making opaque that BTC used in the next sting came from the DEA. 
It might also be true that the coins have vanished from their 'jail' like smoke, taken back by the previous owner. Or a 3rd party. If then mixed, the blockchain would show absolutely no difference between 'taken back' and 'lawfully seized'. What should bake your noodle should include that the coins could both be 'retaken' by the previous owner, AND have to be drawn out of the fund above as a result of legal challenge!
Maybe in time someone could give a probability that coins are being spent by the DEA, perhaps by mathematical analysis of what happens after many of these kinds of cases.

There's a certain difficulty in providing references to stuff from back then, so forgive me...
While I wasn't one of the cyperpunks - I lurked moar - I kept coming across them. Cryptocurrency as it's currently known just didn't exist back then, but the idea of [cyberspace]( was not only known back then, but fairly common: a realm without physical existence where it was considerably harder for meatspace to interfere. 
This had an IRL equivalent with the writings of some such as [Norman McCrae]( and [Alvin Toffler]( who mapped out what a future would be like. Much of it has come to pass.
I first realized meatspace was going to try and interfere when the [anon.penet.fi server]( was rolled over by the Scientologists. Fuckers - I used that service, and I know there were some domestic abuse victims who used it to hide their identity when reaching out for help. How to secure cyberspace became the next big question. And it needed securing both [from the State]( and from [individuals]( as they started to (mis)apply offline rules to online.
Tor directly expands on what the remailers offered, Silk Road directly expands on what Julf's penet.fi offered in terms of a destination. Bitcoin technology is the missing foundation for property in cyberspace: the ability to *secure* it. What happens from here on out is inevitable.

I suspect that your concern is in the right direction but partly unwarranted. I do network security among other things, and while it's true that one could do traffic analysis to determine if someone is using a node (because that's what'll be necessary as soon as packet filtering requires clients move from the existing port to an essentially open port, such as port 80), it would not necessarily have a "huge negative impact". This might by bandying semantics, but the US doing ISP-level filtering of clients *affects only the US bitcoin base*, so we might see a week or two of increased volatility (which is also not necessarily negative.) After that period, the controls will have been subverted by those using it in the US, and so they can catch up with the rest of the world who have long since moved on.
If they want a huge negative impact, they'd have to do it now - and I'd argue than even doing it now would be far, far too late.

Or maybe I'm just shit at my job. Whatever - that kind of insight is invaluable for marketing.
IWSTM that pseudonymous payment in this way reduces that kind of insight to the industry. For that reason, I suspect it might be resisted by the payment processor, and it might resolve itself through a higher charge by the payment processor even in the presence of a steady exchange rate.

1. Arbitrage. The big sell off would be a perfect point to buy in at each exchange, and more people doing trading each would mean each exchange would track the others more closely.
2. The difference percentage-wise may still be there, just smaller: A 1% difference at $100 is $1, a 1% difference at $150 would be $1.50. And by being smaller you might think there's less difference than there used to be when in fact it's the same

That would be no different to prohibition or The War on Drugs, and neither of those were successful.
Not to worry: it would be a huge, huge step to ban "bitcoin" in favor of the legal currency. Basically, they'd have to ban every crypto, if not every thing which could be exchanged for another thing: banning air-miles, Get-1-beer-free-every-ten-stamp cards etc.

If I were on such a jury, I could not in good conscience read your text as to target Bitcoin, because it does not "hide" a sale so as to prevent tax assessment. All the information there ever was about the sale is right there in the blockchain. 
It looks to me like the text is aimed at software that screws around with accounting software or point of sale devices, making it illegal to change their data subsequent to the sale. Conceptually identical to making it illegal to change the number of miles your car reports it has run.

Close to zero. However if they did, the results will be entertaining


In most countries it takes a legislative branch of Government to declare something illegal. However, private banks can do business with who they wish, and they may wish not to do business with Bitcoin people.
The rest of your question can be dealt with quite easily: if one country "bans" bitcoins, or makes it hard to legally use them, they also make it harder for that country to benefit from them, and so allow other countries to catch up and overtake them. The same is true of banks - a bank which passively tolerates them will do better than one that refuses point blank, although not as well as bank that (possibly discreetly) supports them.
Finally, note that Bitcoin doesn't need banks to operate.

IMHO, Bitcoin is less likely to succeed in the US as contrasted to China because a great many in the US are utterly dependant on the Government for funding them, be it healthcare, work, welfare, tax breaks. What threatens the Government, threatens the people. 
In China, taxes (and Government services) are considerably lower, so the people are already more inclined to look out for their own best interests. Ironic, no?
With their Governments out of the equation, I'd say China would succeed first (however we might judge that.) With their respective Governments involved, it'd be a closer run thing. Angry pensioners wanting medicare? Or frightened political 'leadership' want to suppress dissent? Hmmmmmmm

As you no doubt mean voting in geographical elections, the answer is no. There'd be no way to determine if a voter had the right to vote, for example: the colour of the coin would be evidence of that right, and that right would be transferrable - perhaps Pootypoot fancies voting in a US election? Assuming the colored coin would be evidence of that right, and the voter at the station has a card matching that coin, why not just use the card as evidence of that right? Which is what we do now.

Ah, I think I understand you now. 


Not so. Back then, people were being arrested in France for possessing files encrypted with pkzip (such use of encryption remains an offence in Russia today.) Back then, it was well known that telnet sessions from computer to computer were 'in the clear', leading to the wide use of ssh. To the extent that "hardly anyone used encryption", that was because "hardly anyone" was using the Internet, and even fewer were using the recently invented World Wide Web. 
However, it was abundantly clear what was going to happen, and what was needed - such as when the abuse victims who could no longer go online and anonymously connect with help, because the scientologists closed down anon.penet.fi, such as the existence of malign actors starting even earlier than with the rape of JANet.


I don't believe they will defy the government in the active manner you seem to suggest. I believe that, just as people have their communications protected by a technology they don't know about, they will one day transact with each other with a technology they don't know about.

Poor post. Deeply felt undoubtedly, but that seems to be because OP has bad assumptions about what's going on. Examples:
1. "a commerce role that is completely legal". That's not how law works in most Anglo countries - you don't wait meekly by for your dear leaders to say you are allowed to do something.
2. "The dirty secret of "bitcoin commerce" is that there ESSENTIALLY IS NONE". How much matters for OP before he feels like an idiot? $100 billion? $10 billion? $1 billion? Before we get to $500,000 we need to go through $5. Arguing that anything below an unmentioned number is "essentially none" is silly, and is needlessly abusive of the good work that kosher participants *are* doing.
3. "Note that almost none of the big sites that have enabled bitcoins so far ... have reported any numbers (which I think are close to zero)" Curiously, 'Close to zero' is also OP's evidence on the numbers.
4. "Note that almost none of the big sites that have enabled bitcoins so far ... have reported any numbers" Tell me, OP: The 'Taka' is the currency in Bangladesh. How many Taka did Apple accrue with sales in that country during 2008? What's that, they haven't reported that number? You might reflect on why that is, and the disconnect between that and your expectation it should be.

Perhaps you erroneously imagine there's not much to be learnt from 13th century power politics, so continue by reviewing the Prohibition period on the United States in the earlier 20th century. Goverment doesn't like it, bans it, does it make a difference? ... No.

Government can usefully be thought of as sentient of a sort in order to assist understanding that it is a reactive body: prod it one place, and it does jerk back: it's clearer to say "The Government will not long allow a revenue drop from loss of seignorage rates" than it is to say "Reduced revenue will lead to difficult choices for lobbyists vs individual voters with politicians as score-keepers as to the forced redistribution of wealth in terms of corporate vs social welfare. This may lead to pressure on those same politicians not to take the smaller pie everyone is getting, but to expand how much of it is taxed away so as to assuage the squeakiest wheels"

After a bit more thought, I should say no and yes. I don't carry a card day-to-day: I run a small business that appreciates cash, so I carry only and pay others with cash (service workers who'd otherwise get their tips skimmed, other businesses who'd otherwise have to pay 2-5% to get the card charged.)
But then Yes: I do pay for most everything online with a card, so I would use one there - it just didn't occur to me to think of that as "accessing my funds directly".
I'm small, I work maybe 20 hours a week, so what I pay at the moment is about $50pcm for a business checking account with card that does substantially less than what I've outlined. The convenience of accessing the exchanges alone would win what business I could give you.

If MtGox is raided by the Japanese tomorrow - for whatever reason - I think it'll go down *way* over 50% over a couple of days. I think you've misread the risk there. However as long as the price stays above $0.00 I wouldn't think that happening as a game-ender any more than it was when it crashed from $30 to $2. Indeed, I'd consider a MtGox raid price tumble as an opportunity to dollar cost average.


Actually, I think it does. Arguably, productivity has to rise in order to entice those coins out leaving the economy with better products. Also, the effect of hoarded coins is the same as with lost coins, and the thought there is that both increase the value of all in-use coins.

Someone wiser than me pointed out that while this is true of equity markets, in the options market the bid and ask would drop to circa $0 giving a current price of $0. No bids, no asks, no market, no price. In this scenario, if we "all held" the price would drop.

A good, interesting question! 
I doubt that miners would suck it all up not least because at some point it would be cheaper for a miner to obtain private electricity (use diesel generators, windpower, solar etc) than continue to buy it from the grid, so the prices for non-miners would stabilize. Second, by that time, the value of the coins and transactions he's mining would have fallen so far that he would be discouraged from mining, so prices would again stabilize. Third, one could imagine that if someone *did* hog all the electricity, the electric company would see their best interest in limiting him: with commodity businesses it's better to have millions of low-paying customers than a very few big ones.

That doesn't make sense. It costs a miner in equipment and electricity to process your transaction - why would he process it for your "small amounts for small transfers" when that doesn't cover his costs? Charity?
And on the other side, why would you make it mandatory to cap all transactions at a percentage upto N, if N is several hundreds times more than a miner is prepared to process it for?

My point: Bitcoin is something they may find hard to mark if they're neutral. And they're unlikely to be neutral because education is a very top-down profession, inimical to more bottom-up movements.

If you know enough to into iptables, iptables **everything** but the wallet software. Let blockchain update, make backup.

Two things. First, bitcoin is poor at microtransactions just now, just look at the efforts around SatoshiDice transactions, but I wouldn't necessarily stop implementation until it catches up. Second, you might like to have a backup email address also: stolen wallets could be used to authenticate as that user.

**Backup your wallet.dat file**. **Backup your wallet.dat file somewhere else.** Then I'd wipe the copy of the blockchain and redownload. **Backup your wallet.dat file in a third different place**
Remove everything in the Bitcoin [datadir]( **EXCEPT** "wallet.dat". **Backup your wallet.dat file to a fourth place**. Then restart bitcoin-qt and let it redownload everything.

A mutual fund denominated in bitcoin may possibly perform better than such a fund denominated in fiat, and is around the corner according to a developer vid posted here a couple days ago. 
If you want to know what hole bitcoin fills, just take a look at Cyprus a couple days ago: there are businesses who've had to sack staff because the central Government has confiscated most of the money in the account that was about to pay them. You might argue that's just too bad for those people and join Greenspan in celebrating that "there is no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves". However, there now is a way, whether we like it or not. The possibility is obvious, all the consequences as yet are not.

It's not beyond the bounds of possibility that DPR has set up a program with keys sufficient to clear out addresses with values unspent in more than a few months.
1. Hire four lawyers around the world
2. Give them a laptop each to be started and connected to Internet on Jan 1, Apr 1 etc
3. After each laptop started, retrieve old and give them another
4. When laptop starts, it connects, downloads blockchain, any DPR addresses with money in the after three months gets forwarded to another address
5. Automatically turn themselves off.
If this happens, "In rem" would overnight become "In shiatstorm". The court granting In Rem would see that "property" vanish as if the judgement was as naught; Bitcointalk (who'd probably see this first) would be besides themselves with the possibility that encryption has been broken and someone was stealing the SR coins; DPR would be unable to confirm or deny anything. Clearly good for a 30% drop!

I'm not sure what's being asked here. We already use exchanges (albeit non UK) where verification is required, and have other methods by which we can not go through them, such as localbitcoins. It would seem self-evident that people would use an identical exchange based in the UK, or not, for the same reasons. Would I switch from BitStamp to a UK exchange? That would depend on the fee structure but no reason to think I wouldn't at least investigate it.

I'm a programmer. The answer is that there is no real additional security to doing so, and a bit of risk, Assuming your idea was implemented:
1. If programming control is passed to encrypted data where the OS should be, the effects are unknown and could cause irreversible data corruption, and in some cases, hardware failure (cf, [ye olde poke of death]( Can you imagine the legal consequences? 
2. In order to avoid the above, one could decrypt and look for a 'magic number' at some location and if not there, you'd know it was a bad password. But then, there's no extra defence against an attack: It's almost as fast to decrypt and check that address as it would be to decrypt and check the hash. 
Admittedly, your method does require obtaining a copy of the entire hard drive rather than just the hash, but it also means a single bad byte anywhere on the hard drive could make 25% of the rest of the drive insensible depending on the trade off of security vs speed. Apple would hardly risk that. 
Edit for accuracy

You missed risk. The risk the Govt will (try) to shut the project down will artificially suppress prices. 
You also missed business: there's reason to believe the forex markets need upwards of 4 trillion dollars *a day*. Conducting even 1% of that in bitcoins would save business about 100 million dollars a day (Very generously assuming the banks ask for no more than 1% of each transaction there)

They're not cross at getting their money back, they're cross because they have made an opportunity loss. They took a risk: get early in the BFL queue? Or be late in the BFL queue and get the reward from BTC's rise? Their risk did not pay off, and now they're cross. You can bet none of them would be complaining if BTC had fallen in value, yet they still got their money back!

1. I'll admit to not knowing enough about the implementation, but I don't see any reason it couldn't be done, even if it has to take two steps.
2. I know more about. The major security issue is that it allows absolute identification that all of these transactions were undertaken by one person: you. An attacker need only identify one transaction as yours to know that all the others were yours too. In a standard scenario, an attacker could not tell from an identified transaction whether the transactions leading up to it were yours, or someone else who eventually gave you the coins. And of course, having identified the address as yours, the attacker knows exactly how much BTC you own: use different addresses and he'll be less sure.

This is a very insightful piece, I'm glad I read it. I would make a couple points.
1. You repeat several times the theme expressed in "profit that goes to the finance industry for producing nothing." This detracts from your main argument by not being true. The finance industry, for all its many faults, serves the useful social purpose of getting resources from where they're unused to where they're needed. A farmer in California with spare capital may benefit from loaning it to a new firm needing investment in New York. Without a finance industry, that couldn't happen.
2. Crashing the finance industry (I would argue it would certainly revolutionise it, rather than emove it completely) in the manner you suggest seems to imply that prices become more equal between jurisdictions. Is that so?

There's plenty of primary source material both here in and at  that are accessible for free and without registration. While they amount to educated guesswork, I read widely over the Internet and I have to say that I've seen nothing elsewhere that isn't essentially ill-educated guesswork. The Economist is probably the best of the rest. Certainly this forum saw a massive increase in the number of undesirable posters leading up to the crash, all of whom were wanting to buy in, none of whom wanted to do any of the work of understanding why. Panic among them ensued.


It wasn't. The time taken to download a client, open an exchange account, fund it and get trading means the crash had started before the Cyprus confiscation could get going, never mind that ordinary Cypriots themselves *couldn't* obtain funds as at March 25th. There was an increase in interest from the Spanish in Bitcoin at the time, but that's about it.

At the moment, almost no-one. It's thought that in future, those who are involved in transfer payments will be most affected, starting with the likes of Western Union and Paypal, then onto the banks. That will then reach the sovereigns who'd be less able to detain or tax international transactions. That inability, coupled with the Internet, would lead to an increase in 'international' companies that would previously have been national, migrating online for the tax benefit. Transfer payments would then start drying up for many welfare recipients, by which I mean both corporates who benefit from defense budgets, as well as people who benefit from State pensions.

Mid-90s. It was thought then that funds could be domiciled in multiple jurisdictions at once, and flee at the first sign of freezing, it was just not known *how* this could be accomplished. I suspected then that cryptography would slow down the freezing process such that there was the time for a transfer to take place. I first heard about BTC in 2010, and I realized the blockchain meant not "multiple jurisdictions at once" but "**all** jurisdictions at once".
I was involved in the City of London back then, but it was through cryptopunk related boards that I knew something was possible.

It's a potential gain because the purchase didn't complete, for whatever reason, and there's nothing to say that a) they benefited from it, b) the price couldn't have fallen to zero the next day (would you still be battling them to pay all that money for worthless coins?

Well, first he rails against the use of bitcoins as an anonymous currency. It was never designed to be anonymous, but if that's the question he's being asked, he's right to fight it.
Second, he uses the idea of instant-gratification purchases - such as buying fuel - to show that it's bad to take an hour to determine the payment is good. This is using bitcoin out of context - it was not designed to be instant either. If that kind of transaction is desirable in BTC, then I can see an hierarchy of escrow agencies come into play: the driver escrows with A, the fuel court with B; A and B trust each other through C. Thus, A can demonstrate the driver is good (or not) for the purchase to B such that B can feel confident the trade's a good one. I dont think this is a priority for the BTC ecosystem yet though. I shan't bother with his idea that a longer blockchain is more easily/likely tampered with. 
He incorrectly increasing difficulty to each coin, rather than successive 2016 blocks, though that might be journalistic license in simplifying the concept. He's wrong about early-adopters being 'paid' by later-adopters as he ascribes it to a pyramid scheme instead of a common- or garden reward for taking on risk by falsely believing that successive coins pay part of themselves back to previous people in the blockchain. 
He's wrong about the irreversible loss of value; drop $100 down a storm hole and you've lost that value irreversibly too, but I don't see him suggesting people abandon the dollar because of it.
Last he asserts that seignorage has the benefit of a duty on the issuer to properly husband the amount of money available so as to mitigate inflation. Then promptly notes that the issuers haven't been doing that.
I'll give him 4/10, largely because he clearly *has* spent time reading up on the subject before coming to his conclusion but with many points deducted for reading without comprehending.
What's behind his non-comprehension? His wikipedia entry notes him as a tea-partier. That's fine, but that makes him a Statist (albeit a small state Statist.) At this time, he comes from a kind of people that sees government as the solution to government. As bitcoins threaten that very idea, he would naturally recoil from it.

The last paragraph is the interesting bit!
		
Thursday, the world's largest traffic "virtual currency" Bitcoin prices rose above one thousand U.S. dollars. Recently, news about Bitcoin can be said Luo Yi continued. The FBI that someone was dealing in illicit drug use Bitcoin, someone went to landfills Britain has 7,500 bitcoin looking to save hard drive, Canada launched the world's first Bitcoin ATM.
Bitcoin Since its inception in 2009, in just five years, from the bunch, a bunch of worthless digital, rapid appreciation, derived from a number of online exchanges and exchange shop, chip manufacturers even offer Bitcoin mining dedicated high-speed computing chips. Some companies are more willing to accept Bitcoin payment for goods and services provided by the company, including the organization of space travel companies, online travel agencies, offering university online courses, sandwich shops, beer stores, pizza shops, dentists, and so on. Bitcoin has caused governments around the world, financial and information technology concerns. However, Bitcoin inventor has never seen, just to name a paper published in Japan, as has been filled with legendary Bitcoin, and then add a mystery.
When we pay at the store with banknotes, banknote will be handed over to the store, we no longer hold the banknotes can be reused only store the money. The biggest difference between electronic money and bank notes, is that just a set of digital electronic money, the payer can easily copy the code electronic money, digital still retain the group after the payment. Therefore, the electronic money system must satisfy the same currency code can not be reused. General system must be settled through banks, e-money payer to send code to the issuing bank. Bank to verify that the code has not been used before, but the new code will be issued on behalf of e-money equivalent, pass the payee. Process, the bank will record all used electronic currency code, in order to verify future transactions.
Bitcoin put all announced transactions, the participants were all Bitcoin records of all transactions can be carried out to verify whether a set of digital currency to be reused, thus Bitcoin without intermediaries such as banks, the payer may direct "payments" to the payee, transaction costs and less time off, ideally suited for high-frequency, low-value transactions, it may be able to push some of the more innovative revenue model (revenue model), such as web browsing information when using word processing software, successive charges.
However, the value of Bitcoin is not supported by physical or issuer does not guarantee the real economy can be converted into currency or commodity. Strictly speaking, Bitcoin is an electronic currency is currently still count, but can be private or online transactions "virtual currency." At present, although there are companies willing to accept Bitcoin, in exchange for goods or services, but the scale is still insignificant, and because Bitcoin price volatility is very large, these companies are willing to receive Bitcoin, seems to be looking forward to a great extent Bitcoin will continue to rise, more saving transaction costs and other practical economic considerations.
Bitcoin is currently rising dollar value, essentially for speculative factors, there is no support for the real economy. If in the future you can actively promote economic Bitcoin low transaction costs, maybe using Bitcoin payment transaction entity can reach critical mass (critical mass), the situation may be different. However, at present, too speculative, but may hinder the development of Bitcoin in this regard. Just think, if Bitcoin rapid appreciation of the year to reach tens of culture, who are willing to pay Bitcoin daily deal? We will save it up on the handle Bitcoin. Conversely, if Bitcoin rapid devaluation of the store that will be willing to accept Bitcoin it?
Overall, the current Bitcoin speculative component is high, people consider investing in Bitcoin, when stores receive Bitcoin transactions considered to be cautious, we must understand the associated risks. For example, although the Bitcoin transaction records are completely open, each account involved in those transactions, balances, how much are all publicly available information. But no one knows the identity of the owner of the account, but a person can have an unlimited number of accounts, so basically can not prevent the use of their own accounts from buying from selling, raise the value of Bitcoin's market manipulation. Due to very difficult to trace the source of funds, Bitcoin very attractive platform for money laundering, the international community may join hands to take pedicle or regulatory Bitcoin, affect the value of Bitcoin. With the rise in the value of Bitcoin, reducing the potential return, increasing the risk of speculative activity may move on speculation the other "virtual currency" Bitcoin's value may decline or lack undertake. In fact, the network has a lot of similar Bitcoin "virtual currency."
Bitcoin how future development? The bubble burst and disappear from the virtual world and the real world at the same time, or out of the virtual kingdom, into real life, endeavor to become cross-border electronic payment systems? I believe that at this stage no one can have a definite answer. But for the development of science and technology industry is concerned, Bitcoin story is still very instructive. Bitcoin uses cryptography, threshold distributed computing (distributed computing) principles and tools, technologies and resources is not too high, but the inventors aiming credit card and other payment systems existing deficiencies, clever use of mature technology, integration and design out of Bitcoin, and adding different elements to encourage the participation of a large number of network users, to obtain the current fabulous results.

I'll try breaking down where the price has value, contrary to your assertion.
The residents can still buy and sell *on the ledger* of the store. With the store. With other clients of the store. Each trade on the ledger provides a price indication. Each trade is denominated in CNY and does *not* require actual fiat to change actual hands, only for the ledger to reflect the trade for settlement later. What our unfortunate residents are not able to do, is have the store trade with anyone outside our cut-off-from-the-world town. In this manner, our erstwhile residents with no (or few) dollars (or yuan) whatsoever are nevertheless able to conduct trade among themselves.
Maybe in future the town &amp; residents will die with all accounts left unsettled. Or maybe the snows will recede, a new avenue of trade will turn up, and the town will be able to flush the accounts with money coming in and goods going out. Those accounts will be known because of the price action on the ledger. And at last, actual fiat can be provided to those who want it and to the value of their accounts. 
We can thus rewrite your assertion to "Don't reference the price in general stores in Cutoff-ville. Until they accept dollar trade again, they no longer have any real value as a price indicator." Manifest nonsense, hence my downvote.

Clear text normally is bad, however there are two facts you need to be aware of:
1. http**s** already encrypts the entire session, including the username and password, such that the clear text credentials never actually travel in clear text.
2. An attack on https often relies on the bad guy having root access to the server itself. Given that, the clear text or otherwise after decryption is probably the least of the problems about to appear.
I'll allow that as a matter of standards and style, the credentials ought to be in the HTTP "Authorization" header rather than in the body.

No, but that's not what's happened here, unless you have specific evidence that they purchased the asset for you. It has to be assumed it *could* also be that they did their due diligence and discovered they were unable to take paypal, or paypal flagged you as bad, or some other test flagged your trade as bad, or they were advised by their own lawyers against this trade. It could be they did make the trade and then lost the BTC. Rather than re-make the trade, it would be cheaper to give you back your fiat and lose your business. We just can't know, and they sure won't say. So all a court could do would be to say - hey, they broke the contract, so you get your (original) money back.
As a further thing to think of, think of this. Let's say you paypalled them $1000 but in those 30 days, bitcoins fell from $1000 to $2 each. Would you want that 1BTC for $1000? Or would you want your money back? Exactly: you'd want your money back, and you wouldn't be here.

You then also wrote: "gave me 2% of the bitcoins" in your title post, so you admit there you got an ex-gratia payment. That is more than the law usually says you are owed.

1. "The Bitcoin scheme is a rare example of a large scale global payment system in which all the transactions are publicly accessible (but in an anonymous way)." *Anonymity* is not promised by the system, *[pseudonymity]( is. The difference maybe subtle to the lay user, but it is a stick to be used by some who'll beat on bitcoin. Bitcoin is more anonymous than credit cards, but it is less anonymous than using cash.
2.  "Google has entered the market in support the Bitcoin competitor, Opencoin." This refers to [this announcement]( In fact, [Ripple is complementary to]( rather than a competitior of, Bitcoin. Google's decisions should not on its face be taken as a statement about Bitcoin any more than Google buying a banking franchise in the North Western United States says something about the US Dollar.

Bitcoin does not offer anonymity, so you are in fact asking two questions: 
1. How to make millions of dollars/euros anonymous
2. How to use those funds to buy bitcoins.
The first question remains as it has been for a long time: engage in money laundering. The second question is the same as for anyone else: buy it at an exchange. 
Barely-worked example: use a company to buy retail outlets that deal wholly in cash; those outlets buy then destroy mechandise but show in the books that the goods were actually sold, and so they own the cash; have the company set up exchange accounts, buy and forward the BTC, close the company.

No, because it is, actually, very hard to tell the difference between a DDoS and genuine traffic, once you've moved that sensitive server behind a bastion or load balancer which they can flood as they like.

Nope. A company paid me to analyse 1Password ahead of buying loads of them from a reseller and I discovered I could break into the file having got two minutes access to the target machine, twice. The first time to secret a keylogger, and a process to scan/copy off the file, the second time to remove the keylogger and retrieve the file copy and log file itself  - with password clearly present. WITH the AV running, bear in mind. 
TL;DR: 1password and like = false sense of security.
Source 1 is the maker themselves and so is not an independent assessment.
Source 2 looks only at brute-forcing, not at all the attacks 1password could be subject to.

No, that's merely an *assertion* of seizure. Anyone with the keys to do so may transfer the Bitcoins involved onwards at any time. If it happens no-one has the keys to do so, the coins stay put.

Excellent work! Should be required reading for everyone new.


It is an agreement between two people to use a simple number as a unit of money, in the same way that a dollar is an agreement between people to use a simple piece of paper as a unit of money. Dollars are kept artificially scarce (and therefore valuable) by only being printed according to law. Bitcoins are kept artificially scarce (and therefore valuable) by requiring evidence that it was generated according to the rules.


For this, you need to read up more about what the [cypherpunks]( wanted, why the Scientologists wanted [Julf's penet.fi]( closed down, the role served by [The Well]( about people like [John Perry Barlow]( and how the United States wanted to have access to [everything you communicated]( Knowing all this history of cyberlibertarianism, the development of Bitcoin will seem obvious to you. Explaining it to others? Consider Satoshi Nakamoto a *nomme de plume*, just like Theodor Geisel is commonly known as Dr Seuss.


A bitcoin is just a number, like a barcode is a number. Instead of printing a long number off, or printing the barcode off, a "paper wallet" is just when you print off that number as a QR code. Nothing fancy. QR codes store more data than bar codes, they're easier for Apps to convert back into the original numbers, and the paper copy makes it easier for newbies to understand that This Is Valuable ... like a check, or their car's title.

Good question. I'm guilty of giving poor journalists a good kicking here from time to time, so it's probably incumbent on me particularly to answer.
The 'good stories' that I vote up have the common factor that the journalist themself 'Gets' the tech; they understand how the underlying facts lead to logical conclusions, the difference between underlying facts and underlying fiction, and how some people (Numpty Krugman and me included) color their view of what'll happen. As a journo they also understand how to make a compelling story, which here can include human interest on a planetary scale (families with relatives abroad gaining 100% - 0.0005 BTC of that relative's remittance instead of whatever Western Union allows them to have.)
Example. A good journalist who understands the principle &amp; history behind public and private keypairs would not allude to the cryptography being broken. If that cryptography could indeed be broken, there'd be a far, far larger story about banking and national security to be written than about bitcoin, so bringing it up in terms like "as long as long as no-one breaks the cryptographic codes" I see as a deliberate (or ignorant) attempt to raise the reader's stress about the subject. 
An example the other way: everyone knows they should "do backups, and keep their computer safe, yada yada yada Miner_Willy you've been saying it for decades (ed: literally)" and almost no-one does. That wiped file has just cost you tens of thousands of dollars. That carelessness about clicking links with gay abandon has just cost you your *other* tens of thousands of dollars. Not practising Safe Hex will be punished in the most brutal terms, so if journalism is about education, a story that brings these realistic kinds of problems to light is one that gets a thumbs up from me.
Back to OPs question. Realistically, a journo talking about Bitcoin this week will be talking about Syria next week and Australian Banana harvests the week after so will not necessarily have time to understand things the way I do. And I get stuff wrong from time to time too. That journo, to the extent that he hasn't grown up with the Interwebs, cryptography and cyperpunks ought to fall back on ye olde time skills -- literature and interview. For literature, [this book]( has an excellent first half that Gets It. The second half is rubbish as the author skips from crisis to nirvana without explaining how. For interview, a reverse AMA might be fun, where $journo writes his assumptions and we get to nitpick it. Repeat with story outline, repeat with first draft ... etc. Just, please FSM, make sure they have at least bought something online with BTC first! "I'm a journalist and I've looked at this for 12 minutes and what is this" will get downboated to oblivion.

I don't see that admission anywhere in the assumptions for this conversation, however 'admitting owning it' is the reason people should keep their mouth shut when questioned. And even so, admitting owning them says nothing about others *also* owning the keys be means of a copy or (in the case of the boating accident) time-shifted. That still leaves an awful lot of work for the prosecution to establish "beyond reasonable doubt".


This is true. However...


It's impossible to prove in hindsight that keys were destroyed for the same reason one cannot prove a negative (and that one cannot prove the behavior of a computer with an non-maskable interrupt). One might say that the apparent re-emergence of the keys proves they weren't destroyed but merely lost, and so the prosecution has again to prove the defendant at fault rather than some third party.

This is unlikely. The US Government tried to do something very similar with encryption itself in the late '90s, even classing encryption as a controlled munition that couldn't be exported. This expressed itself eventually in the proposed 'Clipper chip' which would allow people to use encryption through it, and only through it, but the chip itself had a key that was kept in escrow and which could be handed over with a warrant. 
What I sense now around how authorities and bitcoins are facing each other is exactly the same as how I felt back then: "I can't add a zip-password to my own documents without giving the government the key? Fo' real??" 
Clipper eventually had to be abandoned in part because it seriously retarded communications putting the US at a competitive disadvantage. I think the same with Bitcoins: they could criminalize and destabilize it, but it would put whatever country did it at a competitive disadvantage.

Well considered, logical. Good post! Only your assumptions can undo you.
Your part about business uptake is spot on; I'd like to flesh it out a bit. I suggest that bitcoins will be most easily taken up by businesses where the marginal cost of an extra unit is effectively none. So: software, telecoms, music etc. It would be next most easily taken up by businesses where the cost of inputs other than labor are essentially none: doctors, lawyers, theaters. Reasoning: they can easily choose to provide (say) 5% of their labor in return for BTC. It would be most difficult for business where labor is the least of their costs: oil companies, gold mining etc.

I think it undesirable that we revisit those problems now so you can offer your book (and others can offer their micro-priced goods), not least because it would fill up this sub with adverts and gambling losers again.

No, it's self-balancing. While you're correct that a price drop makes it less profitable to mine, that reduces the number of miners, and so results in a reduction of the difficulty. That will increase the number of miners as it becomes more profitable to mine. This process might take some time to work through though.

I'm on your side here, but acting as devil's advocate. The distinction between a wallet and a program is lost on the average user, as is the distinction between an app, an application, a program and 'software', as well as wallet.
As per Postel's law, we should be conservative in what we do which means label as best we can, which "close wallet" exactly does. But the flip side of the law is that we must tolerate others not sharing our assumptions or understanding, and using the code in unexpected ways.
It is right that OP brings his experience up, and it would be right for a dev to suggest code to ask "What? Close the wallet?? Are you absolutely sure??? Y/N", and right for the others to argue other ways of handling the problem, such as with a Cluebat. 
Huh, you've added a change, I'll deal with that too...


Absolutely not. As a dev (though not of Bitcoin) I'm suggesting in this case a report of user misuse of code not be dismissed with your cluebatting: if one user does it, others can be expected to do it, and that experience be used to inform improvements to "close wallet".

I started with blockchain.info, sending money via a bank transfer -- easy peasy, lemon squeezy and quick with it. Barclays PingIt I asked for a couple weeks ago and they *still* haven't set it up yet, even with passport and utility bills to a branch three different times. 
My next one uses transferwise to get GBP into EUR in the UK, which then gets sent abroad where BitStamp gets that EUR into USD before finally letting me buy BTC. Although more complex, the overall cost should be hella lower -- under 1% I think, compared to Blockchain, which is almost 5% unless you buy more than £300.
After that I'll try localbitcoins.

One of the reasons addresses are as long as they appear is that much of the address is for error-checking: anyone (or rather, their software) can tell whether the address they are about to use has been spelt correctly.
For each character shorter you make the BTC address, you necessarily increase the risk that the address could be misspelt without it being noticed. At the shortest length, there would be no chance at all to check for errors. 
So with your example, "house blue toy sky". If that's the shortest it could be, no-one would know if the person you're telling it to hears you say "**horse** blue toy sky" - with a normal address, the software would instantly say "nah -- that's wrong"

No direct way, but that's of no consequence: you direct transfer to friends or family outside of the US who then make the transfer for you.

At the moment, all containers have risks. If you leave it with blockchain.info they *could* be closed down under the pretext of something or other. On the upside, Blockchain.info secure the wallet in your browser so the accounts could not be swept clean by those seizing it. On the downside, if you haven't made safeguards, *you* might not be able to access the funds either.
If you use the container in a heavy client (that is, you use wallet.dat) then you're taking a risk that you yourself are a capable enough person to secure the passwords and backups to that file.
It's possible that one day we can have a 2 of 3 kind of system where  there are three keys, and any two can retrieve your wallet. Say, one key could be a password in your head, one key could be in a keycard (like a credit card), and one key lodged with your 'bank'. If the bank is closed, the password and keycard are enough; lose the password and the bank and keycard are enough; lose the keycard and your bank and password would be enough. At that time, there would be much safer containers than now.

Bitcoin directly threatens both bank and government revenue: the first by removing international transation fees, the second by removing international taxes (of which the Tobin Tax is a late suggested desire.)

If the economy was a closed loop, they couldn't "sell off", except by buying goods and services within the loop. And they couldn't shift much BTC before everyone realised what was happening and the price of remaining goods and services rose to match the "new" BTC. And having done the sell off, they've no BTC left with which to do it again.
Assuming the more likely scenario that the economy is not a closed-loop, but BTC was sold for fiat to others, it'd be even harder for them, as now many, many people would buy more slowly, save or what have you so there'd be even more time to absorb the problem.

My understanding - I'm not a cryptographer - is that it can only have one public key. Logically this makes sense: having two public keys could mean only half the work to attack it.

I think you might not understand what's going on if you think democracy is enhanced by Bitcoin &amp; Internet tech, which would be ironic as you're clearly One Of Us. Democracy (indeed all politics) exists as a proxy for military conflict: by (generally) getting the widest acceptance of the least objectionable decisions made, legitimacy is conferred on that decision, and so breach of those decisions can also be addressed without it leading to war. (Okay, American Civil War aside.) Democracy obtains widest acceptance via means of one man, one vote. A moron and a genius have equal say.
On the Internet, none of us are necessarily detained by others making dumbass decisions. Fark wants to use html/1.0 in future? No probs. Darkmarkets selling cloned credit cards? Psshhh. There is no neighbor to build a wall blocking your sun. There are no online problems that democracy (or politics) can solve that aren't already solved by forking. 
Of course, we may well find fraping, doxxing and assassination markets as points along a enforcement spectrum, but these are poor, poor distant cousins of mass justice as we've seen during prohibition times.

You did the right thing, yes. 
Your coins actually live in the blockchain, not your wallet, and so will be 'received' as soon as the first miner adds it to a block. After five others confirm it in subsequent additions, it's considered confirmed. 
The blockchain is huge, and your entries will be at the end, so your computer might not see them until the end - but they'll be there. You may indeed send/receive while syncing - the system is smart enough to know whether you're allowed to do it before the sync is done.

Anyone using a 'phone should be using a lite client as a wallet, rather than a full node. ButterflySammy is right: you are incredibly early to the party. 
In answer to your title question, knowing whether each block is correct relies on knowing whether the previous block is correct all the way back to the genesis block. Keeping a small portion as per torrent would then require your client to wait for someone else to verify the block you're missing, then someone else, then someone else, all the way back.

You're not putting anything "in" the economy (except the fiat €600 which now goes elsewhere "in" the Euro economy), you would seem to be taking 1 BTC "out" of the Bitcoin economy. It would seem you would only put something "in" the economy when you sell your 1 BTC back in exchange for fiat. This view sees the remaining BTC rise in value.
I agree with much of the second para, and note that it would reduce the value of the remaining BTC, thus reaching equilibrium.

Bitcoin is not necessarily finite, that's incorrect; the protocol allows a single coin to be divided to the eighth decimal place but has been so constructed that *even if* all the bitcoins in the world are lost except for 0.00000001, then the protocol can be changed to divide *just that* so there are as many coins available as required.

In a currency that inflates (as USD is) "saving" is bad not least because the saver has his money stolen from him via inflation. It's also bad from the point of view of central banks and economists: money that is not spent reduces growth; thus the punishment for people who dare to save.
Those who know that inflationary truth misapply it to bitcoin which is *deflationary*, where saving is *good* (unless you're a central bank or economist). Calling it hoarding instead of saving is a run-of-the-mill attempt at guilt tripping. Saving is good for the saver here because funds saved will buy more tomorrow than today. 
These are still early days though, bitcoin hasn't reached the point where it will be stable and deflationary.

From the wiki. "The probability of calculating a hash that starts with many zeros is very low, therefore many attempts must be made. In order to generate a new hash each round, a nonce is incremented". Ergo, one machine, starting with a random nonce, will eventually find that nonce returns to all zeroes, from whence it increments back to where it started. This is not a probalistic question, but one of time. Random nonces each time would be probabilistic, but incrementing nonces are determinative. It *will* be found.

You're not off-track, you're just very here at the very early stages. In a few years time, it'll stabilize ... maybe

Example: in a general partnership, each partner has equal access to funds and equal responsibility for the debts. If one partner walks off with the money, the others are in trouble. With multisig, no partner could walk off without the consent of the others.
How much value does that create, reducing the risk of fraud? How much value is released from the courts system not hearing cases of it? It's something a blockchain can offer; it's something fiat cannot.

They need six other miners to confirm what they did, and the other miners would spot the 'extra' BTC and decline to do so.




Again, the software does.

The second world war was good, in that it removed a number of nutters from power; it marked the last time that the international community imposed lunatic sanctions on a defeated power (cf, Germany post world war 1), and IIRC it represented the last period in history where suicides were ever that low. The cost of that 'good', was appalling.
Anything that gets us closer to stability is good, IMHO. A shakeout of the weak hands is good. The cost of that shakeout has been 40% thus far. Ergo, China's news is good, particularly in view of what the news *could* have been :-)

From the point of view of those who benefit from fiat, both are true.
How did it get thus? Who wins wars depended largely on who can mobilize the most resources. The King who can use fiat can reallocate the entire wealth of his country with a sweep of the pen, while the King who depends on Gold has to send someone round to take it from it's owners first. This was only true when wars were fought by massed armies.

If everyone sold, there;'d be no one to buy, and no trades would get done: the price (which is always the price of the last trade) would stay the same.

Information leakage is the danger - unintentionally revealing who you are. Drugs for instance: if you buy some for BTC, then it gets shipped to you, but gets intercepted on the way. The feds turn up to see who collected the package then they got you; they look in your computer and see you used BTC to buy. So they look back in the blockchain to see all your other transactions, ever.

No, you made a series of assertions without evidence and in the face of experience and logic. If you honestly can't tell the difference between that and an arguable position, then good luck with your life -- you'll need it.

My assumption is that we won't see one at least before 2018. The year, not the time. These are still early days

Come to think of it, I don't believe the search domain would be 2^256 but would be somewhat less: the answer would have to be found within ten minutes on average, given hashrate of X. A single machine with hashrate Y would then take time X/Y times longer to find that answer on its own. Expressed differently, the search domain could be the *equivalent* of 2^64 as there are a variety of 'correct' hashes possible for an answer. 
The majority of people would indeed be reluctant I think, but my understanding is that, similar to the previous genesis block, new miners would coalesce with one another, and would be rewarded by keeping the existing rules in place with the transaction fees waiting from people with the old client.

If I buy a bicycle from my neighbor, my neighbor is the trusted authority for his part of the exchange (and he treats me as the trusted authority for my part of it.) 
Whoever wrote your note, then, has a special definition for "trusted authority" which if we don't know, means his statement makes no sense.
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:17:47


I agree with that. But it will not be to zero, and the black market example suggests that even at 10% of GDP, it'd be tolerated. If it's hard for a country to enforce a "no black market" law, it will most certainly be hard to enforce a "no bitcoin" law. Granted, it could be argued the other way: "It has been easy to enforce a 90% white market".

Probably not in the way you think: a paper wallet includes the private key and it would be trivial for someone to photocopy it, sell you the paper wallet, then a few minutes later use the photocopy to transfer the bitcoins away.

It should self-balance: transaction fees would go up otherwise the transaction won't get in the blockchain. If the transaction fees aren't enough, the miners stop mining, and the difficulty falls. As the difficulty falls it becomes easier for other miners to make money from the reduced transaction fees.

That's because you've got some kind of brain damage, looking through your replies to others. Stick to bantz and keep your mouth shut about adult stuff.


And you do it again. Without knowing what I bought in at, how could you know what price to taunt me at? Logic and you just don't mix.

You're assuming that optimal consensus ("optimal calculated how? who decides what needs consensus?") is a desirable thing. You certainly can't run a family of small children on that basis, showing that it's not always desirable.
A bigger problem you might have though is: how do you prove the democracycoins are not being sold to and spent by a foreign power? The vote is supposed to be 'inalienable'.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:41:19
You're right - they could, and some say, do. It's not that it doesn't already happen, so much as introducing a colored coin system would make it several orders of magnitude cheaper, easier and faster to do it.
