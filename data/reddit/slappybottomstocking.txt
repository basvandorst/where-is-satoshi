I'm pretty sure you can't tax memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:39:07
Not really. Lol

It's not an attack, it's evolution. I see it as the market growing and adapting to it's environment. Money moves over to introduce new money. If you can't handle the heat, go tanning.

Picture Saved!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:56:31
It does, so wouldn't tanning make you more tolerable? ��
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:04:36
From what I'm seeing. I saw soooo much support at 36-38.so that's our new buying ground. Anything below or close to 4k. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:26:19
I understand that reference.  I am willing to take a big risk for a big reward. Wouldn't I be diversifying if I converted it to other currencies? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:47:31
Trying to understand why I guess 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:09:34
Anyone else read an article that claimed if the whole world converted to Bitcoin it would be...like... 5.8 mil per coin? Thought that was forward looking. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:55:48
Instead of getting burned for a large buy in now, I can reduce risk overtime.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:00:14
So in my best interest would be to just have some cash and some coin? Of course I'm not going to convert all my cash...yet. so then why should or shouldn't I expand or even breakdown my BTC to other alternatives e.g., LTC,ETH,BCH, ect? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:17:18
That depends on how you want to manage your risk. I realize that my system is very unclear. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:18:48
My thoughts exactly. I'm not looking for a quick buck, this is a buy and forget. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:10:55
Whoa I dropped a lot! Whoa I have support! Whoa! I hit 5k! Let's do it again!! 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:15:27
That's why anything under 4k is a buy for me. That's why I like Bitcoin. It has a life of its own. You can actually identify trading patterns---- and how the public will react. That's why you just always hold and just keep on  accumulating. I'm @ 12% BTC ATM.. :D

I'm doing 10$ buy ins. Give me more control from my shopping spree 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:45:57
I'm just started buying 10$ worth and I've been receiving a little more Bitcoin every purchase with the price declining. I fell this is the bottom at 55. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:08:36
After I reach 1 coin, I'm stripping it off the market to cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:13:50
I think that's pretty cool. But wouldn't expect a large fee for a small amount. You know? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:16:30
What if the price was a third or fourth? Would I have to open up a business to justify the sales? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:39:44
I'm using coinbase. If you have another exchange I'll be happy to look into it.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:31:01
.99 $ kinda pisses me off 
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:52:40
The new buy in is 4k
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:06:01
What about "word of mouth" marketing? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:09:04
But as always, I'm still deciding how to do it. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:53:06
No and not yet. I'm sure a lot of foot traffic would be ideal
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:01:31
Because at the moment , my portfolio is devalued 5% of BTC from holding altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:19:25
How would that be possible? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:36:44
How do?
