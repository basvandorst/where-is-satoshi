Also, where were all these veteran financial people at before the sub-prime mortgage collapse? Where were their warnings against that?
Super fishy.

Guess that means you can’t hold forever.

I’m not sure there would be many scenarios where you would be writing digital currency symbol by hand. Even then, I disagree that it would be difficult. I think this is easier to write than the @ symbol.

Why would anyone with short money want to invest when they aren’t getting a taste of the real reasons to invest such as dividends, voting rights, mad gains etc?
Seems like they’d be throwing away money.

My guess: 
Poor people (like myself) think this because being poor is a negative experience. Because of that, the things poor people output tend to be negative as well. 
Of course poor people would think large organized outside forces are keeping them down. It’s true to an extent but far from the whole truth as I’m learning from this post. 
The economy seems a gigantic ever changing machine.
