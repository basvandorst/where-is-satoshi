From the first sentence it's clear he has a basic understanding the protocol.  My guess is that you stopped reading at the title.

+1 for Armory.  It is easily the best wallet available

Except it's not true.  I'll repeat a comment I made in another thread.

It is entirely possible somebody bought above $1200 and still got bitcoin out.  I was lucky enough to withdraw all my bitcoin from Mt. Gox nearly two months after the ATH and just a couple of weeks before they folded.  Cash withdrawals were already problematic at the time but many bitcoin withdrawals were still going through.  It wasn't until shortly before they went under that widespread bitcoin withdrawal issues began being reported.

Simply attach a form 8949 to your Schedule D with a list of your sell transactions and their cost basis.  If you make a purchase with bitcoin that is considered a sell transaction with the proceeds being the cash value of the transaction.
