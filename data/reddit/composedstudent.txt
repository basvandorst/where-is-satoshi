1 BTC sent over the LN's channels, but will it be rolled out soon enough to slash Bitcoin's **"reasonable"** fee, and transaction times. Because in 6 to 18 months, Ether's CASPER might overthrow the King Of Crypto by the time LN rolls out completely. 
*Also here is my question.... *Do miners have to purchase routers to join the LN network and create a hot wallet? Or will this be a patch to the existing open source code to Bitcoin? Because Coinbase won't be too happy :D

Bitmain can short BCH Cash on Bitmex.

Before a fork happens; a snapshot of your wallet is taken. And if you have a balance of 0.00 BTC you will get 0.00 of the forked coin.

Why would illiteracy be a virtue? You have the option to choose what to read and what to believe. If I can’t get anything from the “articles” , at least it tells me market sentiment.

Thats Fanstatic! I will order one for my co-workers as soon as you start accepting Bitcoin.(For Reddit smartasses, I will not use purse.io to buy the book. P2P transactions for the win! )

And how is this suppose to help adoption? Now I learned how launder Bitcoin through third-party middleman and forgo the **security** of Bitcoin a P2P currency. It makes us the Bitcoin community look like criminals. 
**FOR THE IRS, yes I will pay any gains/profit from Bitcoin on Coinbase**

Hold up... Has anyone send BTC from China without using a VPN? I assume the Great Firewall would block the transaction from updating on the global ledger. 
I might go to China next summer and Bitcoin can help me move money within China.

If you trust Coinbase, they will purchase Bitcoin on your behalf every week.

Is Bitcoin the best payment method? An 8 percent fee; just to use VISA is ridículous.

Congrats on making 400K , your better off than over 50% of Americans. And I got to agree with you, materialism and consumerism does have drawbacks. We are greed bastards who care only about ourselves. We use corporations to extract wealth from the disadvantaged. But every generation is better off than the previous generation. That is a fact. Capitalism is far better than communism.

If your still bleeding money, I would cut my losses now. You will feel better, and your mind will clear up.

Usually it is called a dead cat bounce, but this time around. There weren’t as many buyers. Bitcoin is going to keep water falling down.

Not even Bitcoin will protect your wealth. Gold cannot even preserve your wealth either. Everything goes in cycles, next time jump off a little earlier.

Hey buddy, I wouldn't start mining now. Especially if you plan on mining at home. Unless you have crazy cheap power, your going to have a difficult breaking even.

I believe BCH's commotion has something to do with hit. The price is inflating, and people are fomoing into other crypto currencies as well.

Try [
They let you sell Bitcoin for gift cards. Amazon, Steam, PayPal, etc. 
Try to find the best deal , and start small first. 
Most of the traders I encountered were Chinese. They speak English.

Crypto is still consuming your life, every time you look at the charts. It plays with your emotions. Now is the time to step back and reevaluate. Sell now, and unload this burden. And if your young, learn from this experience. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:30:40
Trying to catch a falling knife is stupid. Trying to catch a bottom is just as stupid. We have no idea how low Bitcoin will go, and if we reach $1,300.  You will have a $2500 loss. No telling how long until you break even. If you don’t panic sell first :D

If I knew Bitcoin will go to zero I would sell, and then buy back once it crashes. 
*Even Bitconnect Didn’t go to zero*

I never buy items with my credit card, because I don’t spend what I don’t have. But can I still buy Bitcoin with a Chase debt card?

A little too unrealistic. If Americans living under poverty(about 43.1 Million) recieve $1000 per Month, for 12 months. Mr Yang has to somehow cough up 
$517,200,000,000 per year. 
For reference, the department of defense has a budget of $686,100,000,000. 
The country is all ready broke, and by taking on more debt, is a bad idea.

Sorry for asking, the customary system sucks.

It is all smoke and mirrors.  If JP Morgan and Bank of New York Mellon think the collateral offered is too risky; they will only lend out money with a higher interest rate. To compensate for the increased risk they take on. If the Federal Reserve didn't inject liquidity, we would really be in trouble. 
Lehman Brothers couldn't get overnight loans, because their collateral was garbage and no one wanted to take that risk. They ran out of money and collapsed.

Best of luck, I hope the community stands by Bitcoin. 10,000 is a huge mental wall.
