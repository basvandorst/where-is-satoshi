IMO, the likelihood bitcoin still exists in any recognizable form in the mid-22nd century is essentially zero.

The likelihood it doesn't exist at all by even 2030 is still a very measurable number.

This is disingenuous. The original MAXBLOCKSIZE increase proposal, before it sort of morphed into "Classic", was something along the lines of a 20MB block, as proposed by Gavin among others. This was rejected and stonewalled.
Then it dropped to 8MB. This was stonewalled by Core.
Then it dropped to the "2MB-4MB-8MB" plan, *as proposed by your boss Adam*. This was rejected by Core.
Only then did it become Classic's 2MB plan. Which was rejected by Core.
One compromise after another to win over the favor of the decentralization crowd. See a pattern here? Saying Classic = Segwit in capacity is ridiculous. The original proposal a la Classic was 10 times the size of Segwit. Saying those who want[ed] Classic "don't wan't capacity" is a flat-out lie, Greg. Sorry.

Here's what's going to happen IMO:
1. SegWit, if released on time to begin with (is it by the first or last day of April?), is not going to have any immediate impact.
2. Over the course of a few months afterwards, congestion will continue increasing and will not be alleviated by SegWit to the extent that the 2MB hard fork is forgotten about. The perceived urgency will remain, Summer 2017 will still be seen as way too late, opinion will continue to tilt to Classic. The voting run by Slushpool right now already shows [a larger block preference of around 3 to 1](
3. To save face, Core will reluctantly accelerate some sort of block increase, whether to 2MB or 1.5MB or similar. They will have no choice if they sense a shift among miners. For all of the "no one controls BTC" and "code stuff yourself" talk here, Core does not actually want to see miners shifting to any chain other than Core.

Every price increase in a competing coin isn't a necessarily a "pump".
Was BTC being "pumped" too when it increased from $2 to $30? If so, then the "pump" was essentially permanent.

I didn't, I specifically said it was promoted by your current boss. The point was that the general notion of forking to increase the block constant, whether it was promoted by Gavin, by Zander, by Adam, or anyone else... was continually whittled down to Classic's 2MB endpoint.


All I can tell you is that you are continually, inadvertently, hurting Core's own cause with this "Core's way or the highway" stance. Luke is also doing tremendous damage to the Core brand as well, with his trollish 300kB slap-in-the-face proposal. Do you not see this?
Few of the "big block" people had an issue with Adam's 2/4/8 proposal. Why was it not implemented under the Core banner? Core has had multiple points where the acceptance of the wider community was at hand. The 2/4/8 comes to mind. What should have been Luke's 2MB hardfork (activating immediately, not in 2024 or whatever) comes to mind. You've continually trashed anything that deviates slightly from the Core roadmap. As a result, Core has angered miners, is regularly alienating users, and is steadily losing what should have been easily-maintained support -- i.e. the BU hashrate right now would be close to 0% if the 2/4/8 plan had been implemented last year. Alternatively, the segwit hashrate would be much, much higher if it had been a 2MB block constant + Segwit [total 8MB blocksize] proposal. Once again, I truly wonder if you see this.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:56:04

@_date: 2016-01-20 09:46:40
Why doesn't the Core team simply budge a bit and add a 2MB block size increase into their roadmap, to take place within a month or two? All of this bickering and threats of forking and other nonsense would end. The pro-Classic people would have their bigger block, the pro-Core people would have their existing dev team and further planned improvements. All for a simple one-time block increase whose effects will be essentially nothing.
No one is "against" Core except for their strident refusal to increase the block size -- not indirectly with SegWit, but right now, directly. Everyone on both sides thinks SegWit (and Lightning) is more or less a good, needed thing, but unlike a direct blocksize increase, the positive benefits will take longer to materialize. 2MB increase in a month (or whatever), then you've bought another year or two to get SegWit into the ecosystem.
As a sideline observer who holds some coins, it seems all of this could be solved rather painlessly if people stopped digging in their positions so deeply.

Hi I just had an off-topic Mycelium question.
Let's say I imported two "paper" wallets, both containing 0.1 BTC. I know I can select an individual wallet to send from if the transaction is less than 0.1 BTC... but is there a way to send 0.15 BTC from both wallets simultaneously (0.1 from A, and 0.05 from B) in one transaction? Or does that happen automatically?
Basically, Wallet A + Wallet B send to Wallet C in one transaction. Thanks.

It's also possible that ETH remaining fairly steady is a combination of:
- People swapping their BTC for ETH, like you said, a surge in ETH
- People swapping their ETH for BCH, for fear of missing out
Those two average out to a flat-line for ETH basically  :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:16:36
No, these are people just swapping BTC for BCH. The combined value of BTC + BCH has remained steady.
Litecoin does not share the genesis block, and - face it - has nearly been obsoleted at this point by BCH, something even [Luke agrees on](
ETH is a different animal altogether, potentially more than just a payment network.

:*sigh*: They can not. Neither can ten people, or fifty people. The market cap has risen by nearly $20 BILLION DOLLARS over the past 72 hours. Twenty. Billion. Dollars.
There are likely thousands of users, and more importantly, large bitcoin businesses who control huge amounts of coin, who need to grow their operations. They can not do so with BTC at this time. The more TXs they can process per day, the more revenue they can make. After the promise of 2X failed, they are finally jumping ship. Some like Ryan Charles, Falkvinge, McAfee, et al are speaking out on Twitter.
It is simply not "two people with help" doing this.
Some people either can't come to grips with this fact, or just refuse to believe it, because many people who espoused the BCH point-of-view were "disappeared" from this subreddit long ago.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:09:59


Coinbase will debut it on their platform in less than 2 months. Other exchanges have added trading pairs. The price bump will cause businesses to reevaluate, or at least add it as an option alongside BTC. Sooner or later, any bitcoin business whose revenue revolves around the number of transactions they can process per day, will do the same. For places like gambling sites and dark markets, there will be no point in using BTC. Even the developers here, among others, espouse the view that micropayments are far better suited for BCH.


If BTC's only value proposition is "HODL FOREVER", it has no real value. And as an aside, you can also use BCH to hodl forever as an investment too. It can be used as "digital gold" just the same, while being a useful payment platform. This is the issue: there is simply little, if anything, BTC can do that BCH can not. That includes adding Lightning at some point, by the way.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:25:40
Yes, nonetheless my point stands that this is not 2 people, or even 50 people. This may very well be just the beginning, especially in the long term. Wait until truly large operations like Coinbase debut the coin.
This is the danger of the echo chamber. Some folks have been persuaded to believe that the on-chain BCH scaling view is only held by a tiny fringe minority. That is simply not true. And why do some people believe that? Because many 'big-blockers' were either disappeared out of this community, or left on their own out of disgust.
"Roger Ver and J Wu" do not control the minds of thousands of people and businesses. Anyone smart enough to get into crypto in the first place is smart enough to think for themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:43
PayPal does not have sub-nickel fees. PayPal does not have pseudonymity and tumblers. All this "corporate coin" stuff is scare-mongering. Keep holding BTC, no one is stopping you. But there are people whose value proposition is something other than "HOLD FOREVER, DECENTRALIZE UBER ALLES". They are the ones who are leaving. Disagree with them all you want, the market will speak for itself.


Coinbase already turned over some records to the IRS months ago. BCH had nothing to do with it. Nobody is forcing you to use any business anyway, like I said anyone is free to hold coins in a private wallet with BCH, just the same as BTC. You can trade the coins locally and off the "corporate radar" as well (i.e. LocalBitcoins-like services), just like BTC. There are few things BTC can do that BCH can not anymore. Shouting "PayPal II" isn't going to change that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:10:45
All I'm saying is it's not Roger Ver's doing, despite folks here regularly using his name like some profane incantation.
BCH is no more or less vulnerable to manipulation than BTC. If South Korean and/or Chinese exchanges are buying it up, so be it. Remember that there's still the *other* 50% of volume (7+ billion dollars market cap) that isn't them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:08:46

No offense, but this notion that Roger Ver is some all-powerful boogieman who can singlehandedly cause an alleged market cap pump of over $15 BILLION DOLLARS over two days is ridiculous. It is what some people here apparently need to tell themselves to deny what's going on.
Consider the possibility that there have been users wanting bigger blocks and cheaper TXs for *years*, who have patiently been holding BTC waiting for that to materialize on the BTC chain. And it simply hasn't, to any significant degree. BTC has SegWit, yet the chain is still clearly vulnerable to large backlogs and high fees which are unacceptable to some folks. The cancellation of the 2X fork was the final straw for them; a new option has presented itself with on-chain scaling that dwarfs what BTC offers, and those specific holders are leaving BTC. That's it. There's no conspiracy, there's no Roger behind the curtain. People are talking with their wallets.
That's true decentralization in action.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:03:43
That's what BTC's "advantages" have been reduced to in 2017 - "but it's decentralized!".
Or more accurately, "but it's slightly more decentralized than BCH!".
Everyone here was angrily telling big-blockers to "just fork off already". Well, it's done. I'm sorry if some people can't handle the fallout from that.
The market will show in the long-term what the best balance is between decentralization and actual usability.
People can and will migrate to the coin(s) that best suit their needs. That's it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:06:37


Continue to espouse the view that the only purpose of BTC is holding it forever, and you will continue to see the price steadily drop, while actual individual users, transactors and businesses flee for a better option. Cryptocurrencies need to be *usable* for things other than holding and passing back and forth from one user to another, otherwise you're basically playing hot potato with the proverbial tulip bulb. Amazing that some people can't see this. Nothing is stopping investors from holding BCH forever as an investment either, if that's their goal.

I know no one's reading this thread anymore, just wanted to point out that I do believe at least 20% hashpower is at least *temporarily* opposing SegWit until the block size constant is raised. I don't think that's "crazy" at all. Upon its raise, opposition may indeed drop back to nearly nil.
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:23:35
You realize that it's more likely that the other larger pools, at least AntPool and F2Pool, will [stop running Core]( than it is that they just start ignoring these two mining pools' blocks, right?


What about it? ETC was hyped as the "original" immutable chain without the rollback. Likewise, in a bitcoin fork, Core would also be the "original" chain still running the prior reference implementation. Just as with Ether Classic, it too will steadily hemorrhage users and price -- maybe you can explain how a chain with a capped-by-dictate block limit, ever-increasing fees, ever-longer waits for 1st confirmation, ever-decreasing use cases, a development team that listens to no one outside the team and is openly hostile towards users... will compete with a chain unencumbered by any of this, even if some small amount of decentralization is sacrificed.

Those two mining pools, and potentially others, are under no obligation to accept Segwit if they don't agree with *the particular way it goes about scaling* and where that method leads. We're repeatedly reminded by Greg and others that "Bitcoin Core doesn't control Bitcoin~!!! Aargh!!", yet there are a whole bunch of people here like you who think that it does and wants the miners to fall in line and accept what Core is offering, just because.
Sorry, doesn't work like that.
And BTW, Segwit would scarcely make a dent in today's level of transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-22 03:05:53
Someone pointing hash power at BU might support SegWit.
Conversely, someone pointing hash power at Core might not necessarily support SegWit.
You can't really tell either way. Those pointing their hashpower at BU are probably for SegWit but want the Max Block Size upped before enabling it. I don't know why I'm telling you this, since you repeatedly say you have no influence on the miners anyway.

There are no "attacks". Sorry, but people are allowed to have differing opinions on when and how to scale Bitcoin.
Miners controlling at least 50% of the hashpower have been signalling for a while that when August 1st arrives, Core will likely have reneged on its "HK agreement" promise to release code for a 2MB block size, ill-advised as that promise may have been. Something is going to give at that time; either Core releases the 2MB hard fork code, or at least some of the miners may switch to a different implementation. This isn't "FUD" or "my opinion" - I don't know whether such news gets removed here, or whether some people here just have their fingers in their ears.
I really wonder what will become of this subreddit should the day come when Core is no longer trying to control the miners with empty promises and vague threats.
