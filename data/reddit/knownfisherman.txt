So essentially it means coins arent being sold through exchanges, so therefore a price increase is not being pushed.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:12:28
So should I sell my coins and buy when price drops.

I do hold ass hole. 
And you call me a idiot? Look at how you spealt Hold its "hold" not "hodl".
And reformat your third sentence to.
"You selling your bitcoins will make our coins prices lower, and as a community we dont like that."
You are very welcome! Also, I do not take investing advice of a person who cant spell right.

Maybe someone else on that PC tried making account and made it so your identifier was gone, or you forgot your password. Contact blockchain. 
EDIT: Check your email you used for this account. They may have wanted to confirm if you want this pc to be able to login.

@_date: 2014-06-16 15:36:55
Nope a Deposit in a bank account is Depositing something you have. In a bank account you cant deposit 100$ when you have nothing.
So same goes with Bitcoin "accounts" you cant deposit 1BTC when you haven't bought 1BTC. So instead of saying "Oh you have to buy bitcoins." say "You buy a full Bitcoin or you can buy fractions of Bitcoin whether its 1/2 or an 1/18th it doesnt matter." and no it should be Bitcoin Wallets, the Wallet is what you download on your computer the application, the wallet is also the address or collection of address's, you "deposit" what you have already bought to you bitcoin wallet, you withdraw to another wallet whether its to sell your coin on a exchange wallet or it is to give it to another person. You have to withdraw or deposit what you have so you buy, A wallet is a collection of addresses or "accounts", but a account is like a wallet in a sense.
Thanks hope this helped im not doing a TL;DR.

There is no way for the government to do this, as a bitcoin wallet requires no sign-up with a name or email address. Thus making transactions not being signed with the names of the sender or receiver. 
But if the government does want to try and control bitcoin by looking at IP's that could simply fail because, we would be able to use a free VPN (Cyberghost or Betternet) to hide their ip.
