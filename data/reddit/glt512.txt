never keep your coins on bitstamp for more than a few seconds. I've had coins go missing before on this exchange, contacted the support with no luck in getting them back. 
edit: thanks for downvoting me bitstamp shills
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:50:09
ok well, mine disappeared. different experiences for different people
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:00:24
i've had coins go missing on that exchange. I wouldn't call it trustworthy

What dangers are you talking about? If you are meeting in a public place and you organize to meet up with a guy who has a high success rate with other customers, the chance of something going wrong with your purchase is virtually zero. If you think otherwise then you are a basement dweller/aspergers syndrome. Also if you are purchasing your coins online there's a chance that your seller will just run with the money especially if it's no escrow and then proceed to say they sent the coins and something went wrong when in fact they never sent the coins in the first place
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:59:04
well if you meet with them face to face there is really no danger whatsoever unless you are the seller. How about you fix your post to say something like don't trade with people online instead only make face to face trades.

no shit

i'm talking about local bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:39:50
it's not improved because there is more inherent risk
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:27:15
it's so silly to use gold, an outdated form of currency that we place value on for no real reason other than it's shiny, rather than bitcoin, a currency that should facilitate the next age of human civilization by making monetary transactions easier.
edit: gold is a good conductor.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:14:21
i like your logic
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:22:37
I am so sad D:  I've owned 12 bitcoins over the course of my life and don't own any now. so much potential wealth lost because of unfrugal purchases.
@_date: 2013-07-13 18:24:31
I only need $400 withdrawn and I set up the withdraw the day that it was made available to do so. haven't received any phone calls or anything productive whatsoever.

I think what most people don't consider when they refer to the 16-fold drop and 33-fold rise in previous times is that back then, there wasn't nearly as much money on the line if you decided to invest. Now that it's in the hundreds of dollars, of course it's only going to be a 2-fold increase or 3-fold decrease, because that's how it scales. I like the idea of this thread, but you can't overlook obvious details like these.

you were supposed to send my coins to 01528 bitstamp address, but to make it easier on you, here is my bitcoin address for that account:
and here is my zip zap payment account 
HERE IS A MORE ORGANIZED VERSION OF WHAT I JUST POSTED HERE :D
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:54:53
took me 11 days for my moneygram transfer to get processed into my desired location. don't use bitinstant if you can help it.
@_date: 2013-05-19 15:29:13
actually, they have that on mt. gox as well. check it out.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:39:12
I'm not sure when but I remember comcast buying time warner 
@_date: 2013-05-19 15:54:08
I guess I just can't see how this would be any safer than the two factor authentication already in place.
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:32:46
hopefully I'll get mine today
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:10:39
you shouldn't use those websites to store your coins, but merely to purchase and sell them. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 04:12:22
bitinstant is the same exact way.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:16:08
I think it's interesting to view this whole situation from a psychological standpoint
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:33:50
A) 2
B) 1
C) Yes
D) No
E) NA
F) 1 day
G) NO DEFINITELY NOT FUCK THAT it's already been 6 days.
@_date: 2013-07-08 04:10:26
one time it took me 3 weeks for them to process my payment :D
they are scummy in the way they do business that's for sure. Btw I bought right before the value of bitcoins went to $260 from like $100. I made no money off of my payment but definitely should've.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:57:47
you don't know that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:17:38
i would be laughing my ass off if bitinstant had processed my money order about a week ago.
