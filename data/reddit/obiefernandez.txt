Title: Using the Blockchain
The Bitcoin blockchain is an amazing tools for trustless payments; the next step in the evolution of the decentralized database technology known as the the Blockchain is using it for other types of data, in an equally trustless/cryptographically secure way. Decentralized Exchange for Asset Ownership and Smart Contracts for self-verifying and self-executing legal agreements are the next steps in this evolution.
