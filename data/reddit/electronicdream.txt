Aren't you supposed to tell the joke ON April 1st?

Any idea why other websites don't have the same data?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:48:01
Because you shouldn't do that?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:32:06
Wasn't it obvious it was a joke? In the past, every time i sold, I sold at the bad time, so now I'm hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:11:06
Where do you see that?
I see it's going down here :   
But not here : 
Can you help me understand? :D
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:56:37
Yeah, I'm having the same problem.  
Been watching those wild price swings and I can't even get a piece of the action because I'm waiting for my transfer to clear...

Their website is responsive so you can use it on a mobile phone.

On coinbase, you just click on "buy".
On gdax, if you buy at market price, you pay 0.25% fees.
If you use a limit order, the fees are 0% if you're a maker.
You're a maker if you add an order to the order book without removing another one. If you place an order to buy higher than the current price, someone must have already created a sell order for that price so all you're doing is buying the bitcoin from someone else. You're just removing an order from the order book instead of creating one and they add fees in this case.
So it's something to know before you trade on gdax. A bit more complicated than coinbase.

Maybe I should sell all my BTC so you can guys can take advantage of the rebound.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:04:47
Ok, I was a bit dumb there, sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:16:51
It says it can differ by several percents. So even if it is 88%, still good news.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:28:22
Ouch that fee. Where did you buy it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:33:36
Yeah, GDAX is just a tad more complicated but no fees for trading if you know what to do.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:16:13
Yeah it's cheaper to buy on gdax.
A market order is like saying "ok, I want xxx bitcoins at whatever price they're at actually".  
A limit price is saying "I want to buy xxx bitcoins only if they're under yyy price" or "I want to sell xxx bitcoins only if they're over yyy price".

My estimate gives 3 days, 17 hours and 45 seconds.
Who to believe?
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:12:23
Where would could I go see that info for BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:33:15
My jokes are too subtle apparently ��
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:18:01
Same for me man. I bought a small amount and I'm just happy seeing the price rising and rising!
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:44:24
Coinbase -&gt; Gdax?
