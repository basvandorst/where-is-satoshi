Well, it'c the world of crypto. You win, you lose - that's the order of life.
Hm. That's the order of life not only in cryptoworld, but everywhere...

Interesting calculation. 
And what if they create some cryo-device to prolong life?.. We can survive until this year and see what happens. That would be entertaining at least, I suppose.

It would be... but it's not. I suppose it takes some special kind of perception and bravery.

Hey, that's all fun and nice, but what about the hardcap? It's not unlimited, so I suppose it can be an issue.

I'm a bit nervous about the crashand the chances of recovery. 
What's more, I'm worried for the small projects like teachmeplease or similar that I support. Will the situation affect them?

I suppose it's both simultaneously. 
Yes, it really feels like gambling, but it's also some kind of cyber-future-fiction stuff - in other words, revolutionary technology.
It's like with that story about glass - it's both half empty and half full.

Hello, guyz! Some updates on my recent question about Teachmeplease. I contacted their support on Bitcointalk, and they seem to be quite helpful. Minus 1 red flag (or I hope so).

It's just a popular trope - you own a Lambo, than you're rich :)
But I'd prefer Porsche. More stylish, as for me.

It sounds interesting.
But in some countries MDMA is a prohibited drug, and you'll get behind the bars for keeping it.

China again. Almost sure they'll ban it soon. 
Nevertheless, the future is here. Saw an AI thread somewhere - would be great to see a cyber world (without freaky stuff like Gibson's cyberpunk or else).
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:33:48
Haha, that's true :-)
Reminds me of my first foray into the crypto world!
But soon I learned, that vigilance and patience are your best allies!

I think it's good that teachers, tutors and professors tend to have such toughts.
For education is important, and to know about future trends is to be ready for them.
Btw, there's an interesting blockchain project - disciplina.io. It's exactly about education! Check it out, and maybe your professor will like it :)

Wow! Looks like the future is here!
Hmmm, what pizza would I prefer to order...

Listen to Vivaldi, drink a glass of fine wine and relax. 
After all, if your heart stops beating - who will trade BTC, right?
Stay healthy and calm, pal - it really helps!
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:12:51
So, guyz, should I invest in healthcare ICOs? Or better education like disciplina.io?
Or pass both of it and buy some BTC?

Did anyone trade with TradeSanta? give me any feedback on it, or send some crypto bots pls
