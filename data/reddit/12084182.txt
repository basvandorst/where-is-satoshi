Alright, cool. I'm just confused about one more thing. I was suppose to receive 0.085 BTC, which I'm sure I did, I'm just still downloading Bitcoin. But this is what the transaction looks like: 
What do they mean by transaction fee? As it stands it's about 1.6 BTC which is more than I was supposed to receive. Is something wrong or am I understanding this wrong? From what I've read fees are in the 2-10% range usually of the whole amount. Not twice the amount or something.

Okay, so I'll Google the bitcoin application. 
I tried pasting just about anything that was copy-able in Armory, but everything came up as not the right format. I know what format I'm looking for, but nothing in Armory matches it, I can't seem to find the address anywhere. 
Under used addresses it says none. I can see my wallet ID. I can generate an address to receive money, but that's about it. What am I missing? It's probably right before me and I'm blind.

Holy shit, 11 weeks until synced. My speed is 100, so it's not that slow... Ahh, hopefully it's just the starting speed and it increases.

Ah okay, so I'm not paying that. For a second I thought I'd be in the negative somehow and was so lost. I loaded another site hoping it would have a more clearer image of what's going on with the transaction and it says TX Value: 355.35548243 BTC so I got even more confused. But now I get it, and I'm relieved I'm not the one paying .15 BTC

Aha, okay. I just had some bitcoins sent to me and it took about an hour to get them. I was watching online progress and I just downloaded the bitcoin core so we'll see how that goes. :)
Thanks for the help. Hopefully it's all smooth from here.

This is awesome! More places are starting to do it now, it's going to boom a lot soon.

I used to study there! When I heard this a while back, that they were accepting Bitcoin, I thought it was so cool! Of all the places to accept Bitcoin... Hah!

Awesome! Thanks for all the responses, I figured if nothing was out there, I'd do something, but I'm glad there is! :)
