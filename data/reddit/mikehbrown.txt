I couldn't agree more, in fact i agree so much that we built a browser miner, and ill now promote it! 
Ad blockers will present a problem for the next while but I think popups like 3rd party cookie ones we see now will help info users of the benefits and offer them a way to switch off miners blocked by ads.

In the US they would be violating numerous antitrust laws. 
But Gox is in Japan.
While I am a little rusty on Japanese law this would be a good place to start.

I trade on CAV all the time because there are no trading fees. Hopefully this acquisition will bring some much needed liquidity to their order books. Love that the fees to withdraw and deposit are lowered.

How about the fact that BTC mining has been hijacked by ASIC and mining cartels.  60% of the mining power controlled by two pools puts the entire systems at HUGE risk.
