Is no one else going to point out that he has NOT invested in any other coins and thinks they will be worthless EXCEPT one other coin that his son has been pitching him which will ICO in about a month....ideas?

Honest question, just trying to learn: How does a 1.5% rate point to an unstable monetary system? I would imagine that would mean the system is strong since borrowing money is cheap? Also that would lead to my follow on question where you say if a recession hits then the system will crash, wouldn't that low interest rate continue to allow people to pay for their 'borrowed money' vs a high interest rate which would be more likely to fall into default? Just trying to understand some more on the economics side. Thanks!

isnt there a chart that somewhere that breaks down the percentiles of BTC ownership? like if you own more than 1000 your in the top 1% or if you own 100 your in the top 10% or something along those lines?

It sucks, I'm just trying to take in info from both sides of the bitcoin debate to determine whats true and whats fake news. I want crypto to succeed and am just trying to understand the base level nuances if that makes sense. I can't get lost in the weeds because I'm not familiar with all the technical jargon yet. I would hope someone wouldn't get banned for asking honest questions!

great answer thanks.

I'm literally sitting on the fence, I own both BTC and BCH at about 50/50...the more I look into things the more I like BTC but I'm just unsure about a couple things left...this is one, transactions occurring off chain (which I just learned what that means) is potentially another concern.

can you explain what is meant in your last paragraph about increasing block size not scaling long term?
