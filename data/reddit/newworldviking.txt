The point is that this choice is not yours to make, it's up to the IRS. True, they have not provided firm guidelines on forks but their guidelines on newly created coins is very close and it is immediately taxable income. You can certainly file using a zero cost basis approach and parlay that into long-term cap gains for a lower tax rate, but if it turns out that the IRS doesn't agree with this (and they're more likely to not agree) you will owe back taxes w/ penalty and have the headache of dealing with the IRS. It's a far safer position to be on the firm ground of paying income tax up front and will likely end up ahead that way.

That's how the 21 mil coins are created. Block reward decreases by half every 4 years or so until the block reward reaches zero. When that happens 21 mil coins would have been created. The reward comes from nowhere, each block generates a reward based on consensus rules and granted them to the person who solved solved the block.

It's very simple and very inadequate. Increased block size is linear scaling. Doubling the block size only doubles the amount of transactions per block. That's nowhere near enough. Ever hear the expression "build it and they will come"? Once word gets out that block size is increased and transactions are cheap, transactions will double. Two weeks and things will be right back where they are now. A risky hard fork for no gain. Increase it more? same thing.
We need exponential scaling. 100x, 1000x, 10000x, 100000x, with a solution that doesn't record for all eternity that you bought a cup of coffee on Dec 27, 2017. That level of detail is loads of useless information and nodes will drop like flies if they have to transfer, validate and store 100GB blocks every 10 minutes. Only a few large corporations will have a say in what is a valid transaction, defeating the purpose of Bitcoin.

That's the beauty of Bitcoin. The Blockchain doesn't need to know your public address and private key when you create them. When BTC is sent to your public address, it just gets put there with zero knowledge if someone created a private key for it.
When you want to spend the BTC, you need to know the private key to create a signature for the transaction but you only send the signature, not the private key. By verifying the signature against the public address, it verifies that the author of the signed transaction must have known the private key *without actually knowing the private key*. Bottom line, private keys never have to be transmitted or known anywhere on the Internet for Bitcoin to work.
Bringing that into the context of this post, the Bitcoin.com wallet has absolutely no technical need to be connected to the Internet to create a new wallet. So what exactly is it trying to send over the Internet? Unknown. It can range from somewhat bad (tracking) to extremely bad (sending private keys). It is certainly not for a good or required function.

They'll come back when they find a lot of new people don't know what they're talking about. The key thing to know is that Bitcoin is technically still in Beta. It's not a finished product.

I don't find this to be the case nor am I concerned about the minor centralization points that may occur with LN. The reason is that it is underpinned by and dependent upon the decentralized main chain. These centralization points would therefore be extremely regulated by the main chain following a strict set of rules defined by a decentralized network. So technically, they would not have any control of your BTC. Some of your BTC would simply be reserved for their side-chain operations. If they fail to follow the rules of the underpinning decentralized network they are at risk of losing their BTC, not you. It is a User opt-in and the user can opt-out at any time. The centralization points don't really control anything. They just perform a rigidly defined service and can be replaced on a whim.

It's very hard to say. Right now Bitcoin is growing in popularity faster than it can handle. A significant factor in 2018 will be the speed in which scaling projects can be implemented. If they don't come fast enough to handle new onboarding it will lead to an even bigger capacity crunch which will damage user perception. User perception is the primary factor determining the price users give to Bitcoin. If scaling solutions do stay ahead of onboarding demand then user perception will be high and so will the price. *Something* big will happen in 2018. But it could go either way, good or bad. Not a great prediction but welcome to Bitcoin.

It's also important to understand the professional's position. They are expected to give sound advice based on their knowledge and experience. Bitcoin is a new thing. Nothing like it has ever happened in the course of human history. Nobody has knowledge and experience in what will become of Bitcoin. That's it's risk. No matter how promising it may appear the possibility of unforeseen catastrophes always exists. 
So from that perspective, it would be very disingenuous to professionally present yourself as a professional who has knowledge and experience in what will become of Bitcoin. Frankly, I'm just happy that he reveals that he has considerable money in Bitcoin. Giving people lines to read between.

They don't know for sure, but there are good clues by how they move over time through blockchain forensics. For example, if you combine multiple address inputs into one output address in a single transaction and they know that one of the input addresses is yours, they now know that you had the private key of all of the input addresses. They can then use future transactions to determine in the same sort of manner at what point the output address could not have been yours.
So on one hand in general nobody will be able to tell, but it is possible to put particular transactions together on the Blockchain that result in a "gotcha". Always report your holdings accurately. You never how good the IRS will get at this sort of thing.

It is good because Govt can cover aspects of Bitcoin that still require trust. Exchanges for example. There is nothing stopping an exchange from suddenly closing up shop and absconding with everyone's BTC, except the government. You also can't evade taxes. Unfortunate but true. There are a lot of legitimate things the govt needs to pay for with it. As long as regulations focus on these aspects, regulation is good.

Leaving Bitcoin on any exchange (even secure ones) involves risk. A cardinal rule of Bitcoin is if you have the Private Key, it's your Bitcoin. If you don't have the Private Key, it's not your Bitcoin.
When your coins are on an exchange, the exchange holds the private key. All you have is an IOU from the exchange. You must trust the exchange will honor their IOU and you are back in the same master-slave relationship of banks. If you transfer your coins to your own wallet then you are 100% entirely in charge of them.

Your post makes no sense.


No, nodes do not connect to lightning hubs. Two different layers. You would simply be the hub. Running along side and on top of your node.


No, you don't need a server to run a node (but with big blocks you will need both a server and uncapped data connection) and running a node on your phone is ridiculous.


Grammar? Regardless, you can't directly deposit to a node and nodes do not manage your money. That's the whole point. With a bitcoin and lightning wallet you are always in 100% control of your bitcoin.


Only possibly in the very short term at the cost of causing problems in the long term. Altcoins conveniently ignore this problem because they don't have the demand that causes it. When Bitcoin had the volume that the altcoins currently have Bitcoin didn't have any problems either.

The biggest thing is that Lightning doesn't help at all with a single non-recurring payment. Making that payment on chain would be more efficient.
I'd say the next biggest thing is that the size of the payment makes a difference in Lightning. Lightning nodes can only route payments up to their balance. This means the payment cannot be more than the the smallest balance in the route. Lightning will make small recurring transactions very efficient. Therefore it will be great at paying for your daily morning coffee at your favorite coffee shop. It won't be great for paying your mortgage or your new dishwasher. That said, it does open a whole new world of micropayments such as paying for your electricity every time you use 1 KWh or paying for your Lyft ride every 1/10th of a mile.

Hardware wallet is best. It's a small device that securely stores your keys and does the hash math offline from whatever you connect it to. That reduces the attack vectors into your keys because no other software runs on the device and the inputs/outputs can be tightly controlled. Hardware wallets are also disposable. When you initialize a hardware wallet it gives you a 12-24 word "seed" that you must never, ever lose. This is the root of all access to your bitcoin. If your hardware wallet is lost, stolen or fails you just provide a new wallet with your seed and your wallet will be completely recreated. If you know your original hardware wallet is destroyed you can just use your duplicated wallet. If the original hardware wallet was lost or stolen, you would use the duplicate hardware wallet to evacuate your coins to a new wallet. That way whoever has your original hardware wallet only has keys to empty bitcoin addresses.
A slightly less secure way to store your BTC is on a desktop computer or smartphone wallet. These wallets are secure and function the same as hardware wallets, except that other software does run on the same device. This increases your attack exposure to malware attempting to hack your Private Keys.
Paper wallets are a secure way to store BTC but do not have the convenience of a fully functioning wallet. There is also some inherent risks. If they are printed on a desktop machine, malware may already exist looking for printed paper wallets. They must be created on new machines never connected to the internet and that OS deleted after printing. The print job can also be stored in printer memory and printers are notoriously insecure from hacking, allowing someone to discover your printed Private Key. Finally, paper wallets are only as secure as the physical paper. If someone can obtain the paper and read it, it's now their bitcoin.

Fully agree with that comment. I'll add that the reason to move to the new currency isn't to eliminate banks. It is to reduce the functions banks perform (and reduce their power) and to mathematically enforce fair rules of conduct. Level the playing field so that banks no longer operate on one set of rules while you must operate on another less powerful set of rules. The rules apply to everyone equally, people, banks, governments. Not anarchy or destruction as some would like to believe.

They can tell more than you think. If bought through a KYC point like Coinbase it can be proven that you bought them. Every transaction is permanently recorded in the blockchain. With the way wallets work it can also be proven that additional addresses are yours when they are used as combined inputs in future transactions. When those transactions lead to another KYC point linked to another person, it proves you incurred a taxable event and didn't report it. When it comes to the IRS, at that point you're now guilty until proven innocent.

The point of HW wallets is that they are always offline, so people are saying that if you read between the lines. They are an offline device that does nothing but store your private keys and "does the math" of signing transactions. When you connect the HW wallet there is a strictly defined interface consisting of valid things to do with it like "sign this transaction", "give me a new address", etc. Since no other software can run alongside on the same device that stores your keys and signs your transactions it greatly reduces the attack vectors needed to steal BTC off of them. Much harder to find a "back door" to the data you don't want other people to have.

LN will be very effective for recurring micropayments, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) where automated devices need to transact with each other.

Value linked to exponential adoption rate is a very interesting thing. This might help you wrap your head around the concept.
1. Yes, that is how exponential adoption works. You tell two friends, and they tell two friends, and so on, and so on, and so on. Pretty soon the adoption rate increases very quickly. This is what "going viral" is all about, all of a sudden it seems to be everywhere because of exponential adoption rates.
2. That's not the reason logarithmic charts exist. It's so fluctuations at different price levels are kept in proportion percentage wise. Otherwise big fluctuations at low price levels disappear on a linear chart. It also helps to gauge exponential growth as it will appear as a steady line on a logarithmic chart whereas it will be curved on a linear chart and will be difficult to determine if it is growing faster or slower than a standard exponential rate.
3. That's exactly how exponential adoption rates work. Consistently increasing exponential growth until it reaches a peak. That peak is 50% adoption, then you start running into the impact of running out of new people. At that point growth starts to decrease exponentially until 100% is finally reached a very long time afterwards. This is of no concern to Bitcoiners nor is it even on the radar because Bitcoin is nowhere near 50% adoption and the goal of most of today's Bitcoiners will be considered accomplished well before that.
4. The same mantra may have been used but in the dot com bubble it was very flawed. The dot com bubble was all about investing in every cool online idea while ignoring the fact that the company had zero concept of how to translate that cool idea into a revenue stream. Companies have to obtain a revenue stream. The cool idea is only a means to an end and for many companies there was no end other than their own demise. Bitcoin isn't a company. It doesn't have to produce a revenue stream, it can't actually. It just has to produce something the world needs to find valuable. That already exists, data security without the need to trust anyone and an immutable record. The markets only need to determine a number for what that value is worth and it is worth exactly that. Completely different from the dot com bubble.

There is also no reason why consumer protection services can't be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol using multisig.

Technically, you already have to declare your holdings. All the BCH and BTG you received from the forks this year are taxable income valued at the moment you had access to it. That value becomes the basis for short or long term capital gains when you sell it.

You're not seeing the forest thru the trees. Bitcoin is rising in value only because more and more people are determining that it has value. That doesn't happen forever. It eventually stabilizes. Therefore it will be a store of value first and it will progressively become a medium of exchange.


This is why you're not understanding. Wipe the money out of your eyes and find out what is really going on.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:11:32
That is correct, but because of forks you indirectly need to report holdings. Every BTC aware tax accountant I've found says that altcoins obtained from forks (BCH, BTG, etc) need to be reported as regular income valued in USD at the moment you obtained access to them (even if you did nothing with them). That USD amount you report becomes the basis for future capital gains when you sell or use for purchase. 
Therefore, if you obtained access to X amount of BCH you need to report it in your 2017 tax return and it's obviously because you were holding X amount of BTC at the time of the fork. I don't like that either.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:32:22
The nodes drop the transaction from their transaction pool because it's old and not processed by a miner. Your wallet will then check on its transaction, not find it in the node's transaction pool or a block, and will make the bitcoin in the transaction spendable again because it will not be refused by nodes as a double-spend.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:19:43
It's also happening because people and/or wallets are not scaling down their TX fees with the increased price. Transaction fees are in BTC, not USD. Transactions are simply bidding too high and running up the fee price unnecessarily.
Bottom line, wallets need to better calculate their TX fees and people need to use better wallets. Until then users are causing the very problem they're complaining about.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:35:44
I wouldn't say it's a bad idea, it's just that you're competing to mine blocks against very efficient competitors. To make a profit you must be both efficient and have access to low cost power. Especially with Bitcoin. Altcoins give you more leeway. Coinwarz.com has mining calculators for bitcoin and many altcoins. Before you buy a miner, plug in the numbers and see what your profit will be. There is a good chance you'll find that you stand to make more profit buying bitcoin than a mining rig.
Sorry, I know you don't want to hear that cuz mining would be cool but that is the reality now. I'd rather you know exactly what you're getting into. If you do want to run something that will help the Bitcoin network, I would suggest running a Full Node. It doesn't require a very powerful or power hungry machine but it doesn't generate profit either. It is a fun thing to do though and you can buy coins with the rest of your funds. That's what I do, I don't mine anymore. I can't make it profitable given my electricity rate, which is fairly standard for the US.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:35:50
You can claim that all you want, just saying the IRS has a different opinion. If you receive a new coin, be it from a fork or a block reward, it is immediately taxable as regular income at its USD value the moment to have access to it. That amount then becomes the basis for short or long term capital gains when you sell it.
Assuming the IRS has no way of taxing you on forked coins is a risky game. By data mining the blockchain and matching with KYC/AML points it is possible (but not guaranteed) that they know you have them, even if you didn't buy them through a KYC/AML point they can still link them to you by subsequent transactions with multiple inputs. There is now zero doubt that the IRS is aware of and watching crypto. If you doubt they can find you, remember they have 6 years to figure out how.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:55:46
It's 20k in a single transaction, not cumulative. Your example does show that you owe tax tho. You sold it. That is a taxable event which will have a capital gain or loss. The IRS doesn't care if you move anything in and out of Coinbase, just if you sold and had no capital gains on your income tax.

That's debatable. Right before the Mt Gox collapse, where 80% of all trading happened at the time, 30-50% of its volume was the infamous WillyBot.

There was also a point where USD withdrawals were halted but BTC was not. So people who were concerned something bad was afoot bought BTC at any price just to be able to withdraw something from Mt Gox before things went really bad.
So yes, I would call 2013 a bubble. Specifically, the Mt Gox Collapse bubble.

Remember, in the US at least it's not just capital gains. BTC forked several times in 2017. *RECEIVING* those fork coins (BCH, BTG, etc) is a taxable event and must be reported as regular income valued in USD the moment you had access to them. *Even of you never sold them!*
No, I'm not happy about that either.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:31:02
When coins are mined they are immediately taxable as income at their USD value the moment you had access to them. But that IRS guidance didn't exist when the OP mined it so there's probably a pass there on his old tax returns.
When the OP sells the coins (the fact that the OP forgot about them and found them doesn't really matter) the OP would need to report long term capital gains, likely a 15% tax rate. To be safe, I would report their basis value as 0 and pay 15% on the entire amount. After all, you could just say at the time you rounded off the numbers... to zero.

@_date: 2017-12-05 01:20:56
This gets a little complicated because it's both a taxable commodity and a prize. The price you purchased the bitcoin for is the Basis. Anyone who wins needs to report it as income that tax year at the basis price. This is because it's a prize. When they sell or use it to buy something they need to report the capital gains, the difference between the Basis and the Sell price. This is because it's a taxable commodity.

Not true, unfortunately. Coins received in a fork air drop (like BCH) count as regular income *the moment you have access to it* and if you HODL it the basis becomes what you had to report as regular income. Note the key part of the phrase. If you had your coins in Coinbase, you won't have access until Jan 1 so you don't need to report it until 2018 taxes and it will be at its value on Jan 1 2018. If you had BCH in another wallet and could access them sooner, they must be reported on 2017 taxes at its market value on that day.
In the case of the overvalued RomeoCoin previously described, if your wallet at the time of the fork doesn't support RomeoCoin splitting then you don't have access to it and do not owe taxes on it.

That would be a concern if not for the fact that with LN anyone can close and settle a channel at any time. So nobody can keep coins "hostage". In your example, Coinbase certainly could exercise control over who is allowed to create channels with them but to what end? There is nothing stopping Amazon, Google, Microsoft, JP Morgan, Chase, Visa, Amex, McDonalds, the Winkelvii, or the crypto geek early adopter down the street from doing the same thing. Coinbase will not be the only reasonable option. LN operates on the theory of 6 Degrees of Separation. Even if you just open a channel with your Cousin, chances are a route can be found to anyone you want to pay.

It's technically not a ledger because it doesn't store balances, it just functions as one. What the blockchain really does is chain every transaction to a previous transaction and so forth all the way back to the coin's creation. It's transactions are confirmed, not bitcoins. A transaction from address A to address B is confirmed in the blockchain when it is included in a block. The transaction gets an additional confirmation when an additional block is chained to the block containing the transaction. The more confirmations a transaction gets, the more work must be done to alter the transaction as every block after it must be re-hashed. Once a transaction has 6 confirmations the amount of work that must be done to change it becomes so high it is very safe to say it is permanently embedded in the blockchain.
So to answer your question, a bitcoin can have a transaction history that is confirmed an infinite amount of times. When all bitcoins are mined it only means that new bitcoins are no longer created. Every transaction must still be linked back transaction by transaction to the block where that bitcoin was originally mined.

Not so. If all of BTC moved to BCH there would be more transactions and they would be larger. There would be zero incentive to be efficient in the number of transactions one creates until the 8MB block limit is reached and BCH has the same problem. (if you build it, they will come. Until a limit is reached.) Also SegWit is not supported so all transactions would be larger.

You can't make the nodes drop the transaction. If you think about it, you could do bad things if you were allowed to do that. 
What you can do is called Replace-By-Fee (labeled "increase fee" in some wallets) which is you double-spend the transaction with an identical transaction that has a higher fee. The nodes will allow the higher fee transaction to replace the low fee transaction as long as everything else is the same.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:10:59
Very good question. Exchanges are different than wallets. When you send an exchange BTC or obtain BTC on an exchange, it's in the exchange's wallet not yours. The exchange holds the private key and you only have an IOU from the exchange. You must trust that the exchange will pay up if you cash in that IOU. That's why everyone says to never store your BTC on an exchange unless you are actively trading it. Because you don't have that BTC's private key.
The Bitcoin Golden Rule for newbies: If you hold the private key (the BTC is in a wallet you created), it's your Bitcoin. If you don't hold the private key (the BTC is in an account of some company), it's not your Bitcoin.
It's a good idea to create wallets offline (especially paper wallets) but realistically most users don't do that. What is more important is that you choose your wallet carefully, check multiple sources for technical reviews and prefer open-source wallets. Open Source means that the source code is available for anyone to download and review. Of course, non-technical newbies won't scour source code but it is important to know that anyone can. There will certainly be geeks who do exactly that and will raise an alarm if there is anything suspicious in there. That is also why the Bitcoin network is trusted. Anyone who cares to can look at the source code and know exactly what it does and how it does it.

A wallet is a utility for managing many addresses. The address aspect of it all happens under the hood and you don't even need to know it's happening. You can combine two addresses into one via a transaction to yourself but there is no advantage to it. The blockchain will still track the transaction history through those two addresses. When you make a transaction from that combined address you must spend all the BTC in that address. What the wallet is actually doing is creating a transaction spending all the BTC in the original address and sending it to two outputs. One is the address you wanted to send BTC to, the other is a new address the wallet generated for yourself which receives all the change. So combining BTC into a single address has no real advantage at all.

Of course, having a lot of Bitcoin enables you to do things which you can't if you have almost none. Take a trip to outer space, for example. (At least one of the Winkelvii booked a SpaceX flight with their Bitcoin. The other said he bought Legos. Whatever floats your boat.)
BUT even with crazy amounts of Bitcoin, things you still cannot do include (but are not limited to):
* Freeze or seize anyone else's Bitcoin
* Stop anyone from spending their Bitcoin
* Stop anyone from sending Bitcoin to a particular person or group
* Recind your transactions or anyone else's
* Create new Bitcoin and debase everyone else's Bitcoin, making it worth less
* Distribute new Bitcoin as you deem fit (i.e. Bailouts and payoffs)
All of which can currently be done in the Fiat system by the Financial Elite such as financial executives and governments. This results in a minority having great power over the majority. In Bitcoin they have no more power than the Average Joe in the street, albeit they may use that identical power to greater effect. Which is fair enough because there is no system in place which intrinsically prohibits the Average Joe from doing the same thing.

The worst case scenario for a bitcoin TX with too low fees is that it sits in the mempool for 2 weeks, gets dropped by the nodes for being too old, then the sending wallet (GDAX) will no longer find the transaction and will make the coins spendable again since the nodes will no longer reject it as a double-spend. So bottom line is that you won't lose your coins, worst case is they're on a 2 week vacation.
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:49:55


A partial definition. A Fiat money supply is controlled by a government making it subject to hyperinflation if money supply exceeds GDP. BTC has a pre-determined fixed supply. It is also global and cannot be tied to a country's GDP but rather global GDP. It was also not created by a government. All of those facts do not fit the definition of fiat money and is a closer fit the definition of Gold. 
I suppose you'll say that Gold has alternative uses (jewelry, electronics, etc) but BTC also has alternative uses beyond a currency due to its immutable ledger.

Yes, some will be lost but "everyone" won't lose their private keys. Ultimately lost coins will result in less BTC to go around, supply drops while demand remains. Value goes up.


It's not that different from seized funds. The difference is that instead of being redistributed to a corruptable authority, it is redistributed in increased buying power to all remaining coins.
Worst case scenario is that additional decimal spaces will be added. Yes, it will require a hard fork and consensus in Layer 1 but not 2nd layer. If this does become a problem, consensus shouldn't be very difficult to achieve as it has the effect of increasing the supply but by deflation instead of inflation. It will be of benefit to everyone already holding BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:07:51
Bitcoin is still in early stages of development and adoption. That in itself temporarily persuades people to use it as a store of value before using it as a currency. When the "land grab" of adoption subsides the currency use will be more prominent. In addition, technical advances are on the horizon which will reduce existing friction in using it as a currency. One example is that Lightning Network (ETA 2018) will make Bitcoin much more conducive to small payments and recurring micro-payments. This will be critical for the Internet of Things (IoT) as autonomous machines can't use a credit card. They need to operate on micro-payment channels such as Bitcoin Lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:47:53
The primary problem that Bitcoin will have in unseating credit cards is that Bitcoin is completely honest about its fees (you know exactly how much you pay for your transaction) and consumer protection (It's like cash, it's only between you and the recipient). Credit cards are not honest about its fees (you think it's free but a higher fee is baked into the price of goods) or about consumer protection (you might have some, you might not. It's all based on the whim of a 3rd party). From the viewpoint of the consumer, the front that Credit Cards puts up does look better, even though it isn't necessarily so.

I didn't say he *will* be disappointed, I said he *might*. You need to do the math to make a decision. Also the calculators are for a snapshot in time but you mine over a long period. Things change and mining quickly become obsolete. 
A major factor is that as the bitcoin price increases, mining becomes more profitable, which causes more to mine, which increases difficulty, which reduce mining profits. You need to predict a diminishing rate of return. On the other hand if you just buy bitcoin instead, price increases may increase exponentially (of course that isn't guaranteed) and you directly realize all of that profit. 
I'm not saying the OP can't make an income mining. I'm saying that miners aren't delivered quickly, difficulty increases with price negating profit, next generation mining rigs decrease profit and you might find that you would have been much better off just buying bitcoin instead. It's a slim margins game and mining rigs profitability has an expiration date. You need to know how to play it. It's not just get a rig and make money from nothing anymore.

I think you're right on the crypto bubble, or rather the altcoin bubble. Eventually people will realize that most of them are just the product of some geek in a basement and they're not in the same league as the leading coins. But like the .com bubble, people only see them at their face value of being a cryptocurrency and don't realize there is more to it than that.
I don't see Bitcoin being the loser either, technology wise. I think it hit the right priorities right on the head or at least gained them through experience. Bitcoin's primary focus is stability and decentralization, not rapid scaling or fast development. That's exactly right, this is people's money we're talking about. Nobody wants new features or scaling if it means someone else being reckless with what already exists. Slow and deliberate is what makes it a store of value. If better technology comes along and proves itself, bitcoin can still implement it in its slow, careful manner.
That's why S2X made me nervous. If Bitcoin is going to be unseated it will likely be via a social/fud vector instead of a technical one. Very glad to see that one fail.

Definitely true. There are a lot new people now who have crossed the line between "very optimistic" and "disillusioned". Bitcoin is facing a big User Perception problem because many are not acknowledging that popularity is exceeding technical ability. People think it will do more than it can right now.

It's also helpful to understand how often that happens. When a block is rolled back because of this it's called "Orphaned Blocks" and the transactions in the block are returned to the mempool. According to blockchain.info, over the past year transactions with 1 confirmation were orphaned 39 times. Transactions with 2 confirmations were orphaned 8 times. Transactions with 3 confirmations were orphaned once. Transactions with 4 or more blocks were never orphaned.
The reason why 6 confirmations is the "magic number" of confirmations is that statistically with each confirmation it becomes much less likely that the transaction will be orphaned. 6 confirmations is the point where it is "statistically impossible" to be orphaned. In the history of the blockchain 5 confirmation transactions became orphaned once. 6 confirmation transactions were never orphaned.

Forgive me if this is obvious but since you say you're a noob... Have you used a bitcoin mining calculator to determine your expected profit? You might be disappointed since you would be competing against large scale operations with access to very cheap power. Profit margins on mining are very low. Often you find you're better off just buying them on an exchange.

Never. Even if every satoshi were in a different address (making the most target rich environment possible) it would still take about 130,000 years of dedicated supercomputer use to brute force guess one public/private key combo. Trying to brute force your specific address would take much longer. Because of the way keys are generated, regenerating keys adds zero security against brute force attacks. It will be just as likely to guess your new keys as your old, which is not likely at all.

The reality is that the Bitcoin protocol is not ready to scale to mass adoption levels *yet*. The prevailing wisdom is that it is better to inconvenience a small amount of users now than to inconvenience a larger amount of users later. This is user perception management and it prevents Bitcoin from becoming a victim of its own success. We don't want mass adoption until the technical solutions are in place. 2018 should be a big year for that.
Keeping the 1MB block size restraint in place adds demand for far more effective 2nd/3rd layer solutions which is the only reasonable way to scale. Also, every change to the block size limit is a hard fork which is risk to the entire network and its market cap. People will be far more concerned with an unintentional fork than competing for inclusion in blocks.
So it's true that block limitations and high fees are impeding mass adoption, it's a necessary inconvenience right now for the benefit of the long term.

If replenishing, carefully watch for new IRS guidelines. It's currently unknown if they expect you to report capital gains on that 0.05 BTC and start a new basis with the replenished 0.05 BTC, or if they will allow the capital gains to carry over to the replenished BTC.

The IRS doesn't care about transfers on/off exchanges. They care about your buys &amp; sells. The sell is the taxable event and the basis is your buy. The IRS does look at bitcoin as a "thing" that you buy and sell. To the IRS there is no difference between physical commodities and bitcoin. And yes, that is very burdensome to crypto users.
At least there was a bill introduced that would avoid capital gains on all bitcoin purchases below $600. I wonder what became of that...

Bitcoin is global. Even a giant bank isn't big enough, even with a government in its pocket because individual governments aren't big enough to be more than a hindrance. It would take all governments working in unison to squash the Bitcoin network and even then it would be difficult. I highly doubt that will happen because when some governments ban Bitcoin, it can become a competitive advantage against those governments for other governments to support Bitcoin.

That's not how you do it. You keep BTC and USD on two exchanges. When the gap is large enough you buy on one and sell on the other simultaneously so your total holdings of BTC or USD remain constant, depending on which one you're trying to accumulate. When the gap is narrow you take the time to move funds &amp; coins to reconcile. Repeat. It's not a big income generator, but the risk is much lower.

Don't worry, if you do nothing the worst case scenario is that your transaction gets dropped from the mempool after 2 weeks, your sending wallet will detect that and make the funds available to you again.

I 2nd that response. It's reached a point where a govt banning BTC is a game of russian roulette. Governments can't ban bitcoin, they can only ban it within their jurisdiction which will leave them at a major economic disadvantage if bitcoin succeeds elsewhere in the world. They can't even ban bitcoin in their jurisdiction entirely as there are so many ways for individuals to work around a govt ban, even on a firewalled internet. The only way a government ban can succeed is if all governments band together and globally ban it. That won't happen for two reasons. One, governments never cooperate with each other. Two, the more governments that ban it creates more incentive for other governments to take a chance on supporting it in the hopes that it will increase their global economic power over those that banned it.
So there may be incidents along the way but it's like trying to hold back the tide.

So what you're saying is that you'd like the US dollar more if every time you went to the convenience store you got the Federal Reserve involved. I'd rather use a 2nd layer as a primary means of trivial transactions. It doesn't make sense to use the same transaction type for trivial and trillion dollar transactions.
There is no BCH development beyond basic liner scaling, which is completely inadequate. Global transaction quantity will grow much greater and faster than a 32MB block can handle, or a 320MB block, or a 3.2GB block. BCH is simply doomed to fail.

Many people still profit from mining but they are highly efficient, have access to cheap power and operate on an industrial scale. You have to be at least in the ballpark of that to profit.

In the US, if you held the BTC for more than 1 year, it's capital gains at 15% (20% if you have a very high income). Less than 1 year it's regular income at your usual tax bracket rate. To determine your raxible income/gains, it's BTC Sell price - BTC Buy price. 
This is important.
To avoid a tax penalty you need to file a quarterly tax return and send the taxes you owe on the transaction early. Don't wait until April for $110k as the penalty for late payment can be substantial.

1. But when have most countries ever agreed with each other? Especially when there will always be an incentive to "defect" and bet on a changing of the guard. Very unlikely IMO.
2. A possibility but Bitcoin is known for safe steady development which can adopt new concepts when it is safe to do so.
3. Exchanges are like a hydra. Destroy one or some and another can grow and replace it. Temporary disruption. Mt Gox proved that.
What you missed:
1. A security exploit is found and used to disrupt and destroy the network. This is not at all easy but can't be ruled out. On the plus side, Bitcoin has been existing deep in the wilds of the internet for 9 years begging to be compromised. Nobody has yet to succeed. Just because it is proven anti-fragile  (a real term, Google it) doesn't mean it is indestructable. 
2. A social attack. IMO, the Bitcoin Cash fork, NO2X, and the NY Agreement was the most dangerous attack on Bitcoin. Had a good chance of succeeding on social grounds, not technical. But it did prove that users make the mining market, the miners do not lead the users. 
3. The unknown. This is completely new territory with little precedence. There can be dangers we can't conceive of right now.

Historically, every time Bitcoin had a big run up in value it was followed by a "crash" correction. But this correction was always higher than before the run up so is it really a crash? Bitcoin tends to "breathe". A big inhale, smaller exhale, big inhale, smaller exhale, increasing in value each time. People are just preparing themselves for history to repeat even though there is no clear reason that it will. If this is your first rise up, HODL through the dips in the roller coaster. Historically one didn't get squarely into the black until your 2nd big run up. Don't try to time the market as it's mostly luck. HODL has always profited in time. The only losers in bitcoin were the ones that panic sold on a dip.

Your concern is quite valid. Bitcoin needs not only a technical victory but also a sociopolitical victory. I see this as a very interesting case of irresistible force meets immovable object. The finance industry will certainly want to stop bitcoin and will try. But how? It's decentralized and global. Nobody has jurisdiction over the entire network, only parts of it. If a government bans or hinders it, bitcoin will just thrive outside of its borders leaving that country behind until it is adopted. Economic suicide. All governments will have to cooperate if there is any chance, which is near impossible. Banks will have to reluctantly adopt it and reduce their influence or become irrelevant. This will be very interesting as it plays out. Will the immovable object find a way or will it cease to be?

You're on point. It's pseudo anonymous. While anyone can create a bitcoin address and nobody would know who owns it, all transactions between addresses are public, certain addresses are well known, and some well known addresses have full KYC identification of the owner. That's a lot of data to mine for forensics and it can produce a surprising amount of identifying information. 
Improving bitcoin anonymity is something that people are working to incorporate in the future.

Really. Well... except for that one time. In 2010 there was a bug in the bitcoin protocol that allowed someone to craft a transaction that created something like 180 million new bitcoin. It was quickly spotted and eradicated when more than half of the network applied a patch and switched to a competing chain without the transaction. But outside of that early incident, bitcoin has been freely available for anyone to join the network and attempt to hack it. 10 years on and nobody has been successful. That is an incredible accomplishment.
Don't confuse news of a bug or security risk in an individual wallet with a bug in the bitcoin protocol. There was only one way back in the day and none since.
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:46:03
Bitcoin was hacked once when it was a wee bitty baby. It was corrected within hours and is no longer part of the BTC blockchain. An early childhood incident. The lack of a hack 8 years afterwards (when BTC gained much more value) speaks more than the hack during its early infancy.
 
@_date: 2019-10-25 00:23:20
You pretty much can't prevent that transaction from happening. There's clearly a lot of misunderstanding about this. Get the transaction to one node and it's going to propagate all of them and mined into a block. Nobody can move those coins (to seize them) without the private key, so it is censorship resistant. What it's not is privacy resistant. Everyone knows the transaction happened. We wouldn't necessarily know that the sending wallet is yours and the receiving wallet is your mother's, but there are ways to figure it out. Without getting too technical, every satoshi can be tracked from wallet to wallet from its creation to present. There are certain points during that journey where a wallet can be associated to a person, such as a KYC exchange. There are ways of linking unrelated transactions because of change addresses. That's enough to mine a lot of information about who holds what and what they're doing with it.

Make sure you understand your income tax reporting requirements and liability before you decide to do that. It will complicate things thanks to current IRS rules. You'll need to keep track of the value of every BTC when you receive it and when you spend it. All gains/losses between the two have to be reported as capital gains. Short term if held for under 1 year, long term if held over 1 year. If you mess it up the IRS will be mad at you. Ain't nobody got time for that.

Think of it this way. If everyone left a big pile of money in the street would nobody try to pick it up? Of course not, somebody will always compete to get as much of it as possible. That's how mining works.
The incentive for mining is a big pile of money up for grabs in the form of Block Rewards and Transaction Fees. As Block Rewards decrease, total Transaction Fees should increase. Somebody will always compete for it and difficulty is adjusted so someone somewhere mines a block every 10 minutes or so.

Most people will report it if they are aware they need to. The Coinbase case places zero doubt that BTC is on the IRS radar. The blockchain is public.

That's it exactly. Bitcoin's problem is that it is very honest about fees. The user know exactly what they are paying. It is competing against other methods deliberately hide their fees, forcing vendors to bake the cost into the price of goods and services. The user has no idea what they are paying.

Not quite there, but I get it. I'm no longer telling family/friends about Bitcoin. I already have many times and culminated in a "this is the last time, I'm leading you to water, I can't make you drink. Just don't say I didn't tell you. From now on you must ask me about it before I say anything." announcement. So that's where I am.
My wife only just started believing when I showed her my Bitcoin wallet, transferred some to an exchange, sold it, withdrew it to a fiat bank account and bought her an anniversary ring. So there dear, it's real actual money. Eventually the jeweler will realize that too and will accept Bitcoin directly instead of paying the credit card company 3% to charge my card.
That's what it took to get her to think that there might be a slim possibility that I'm not living an insane fantasy world. smh

I don't agree that the fees need to come down. They are necessary, for now. We don't want adoption to outpace scaling technology. That would be bad for Bitcoin. The only solution to bring down fees right now (aside from the unused SegWit) is bigger blocks. But I'm not interested in 2X or 8X. Bitcoin needs 2000X or 8000X without centralizing in large datacenters. We need that technology in place. Until then, high fees do an excellent job at throttling adoption that it isn't ready for.

Let me explain the article then. Not every address can be linked to someone's identity, but some are. Every transaction among every address is permanently recorded. You can completely follow the money. Because of how change addresses work it's not just the bitcoin that was sent to &amp; from the known address that can be traced but also other bitcoin in wallets transactionally linked to the known address that were never sent to/from the known address.
Good luck creating deniability when its recorded in a distributed cryptographic public permanent record. Bitcoin is not about getting away with things, anarchy. Bitcoin is about enforcing fair rules that everyone must follow regardless of wealth or political power, crypto enforced law.

Not exactly. The cost of the miners is already a sunk cost. They have to keep them running to minimize their loss. The only ones who will stop mining Bitcoin are those who don't have enough reserves to cover electricity and will go into bankruptcy, or those that switch to an altcoin. The rest will mine at a loss but still cover electricity expenses, hoping that price will rise and they can recoop their loss.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:22:58
I hold a different viewpoint. It wasn't merely Internet savvy people, it was people who were interested in new technology and actively searched for it. They didn't just buy a lot of Bitcoin for fun, they bought or mined it for its principle. Albeit a pie-in-the-sky notion at the time. Maybe it was the fun of furthering an interesting experiment with potential. 
I don't think confidence is the right word. It was hope, a vision, but confidence is just too strong a word. The real miracle of Bitcoin was going from $0 to $100. From that point on it became less miraculous and more confident.

As for the rest of your life savings, if you are young (&lt; 29) and single I would call it a risky gamble but I wouldn't exactly call it stupid as you would be young enough and have enough time to recover if it fails. If you're over 29 or have a family/kids to support I would call it stupid. Keep it proportional to your situation, needs and responsibilities. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. 
Edit: Add
To clarify the risky gamble, here is what you are gambling on. Everyone talks about bitcoin taking over the world and the price going to the moon. The reality is that the technology as it stands today is incapable of scaling to that size. It's not just a matter of popularity, it's also about solving existing technical limitations. You are gambling that bitcoin developers will somehow, someday, figure out a way to do that at the technical level *and* it becomes a popular means to conduct business. There are a lot of brilliant people working on it but right now they do not yet have a complete scaling solution yet. That is the gamble.

Look at your electric bill for your rate and google for utilities which let you adjust power and clock settings for your card. I can't tell you either of those. For your card you may find it as an overclocking utility, except you will be doing just the opposite of overclocking.

You're looking for the highest hash rate to watt ratio you can get, not the fastest hash rate you can get.

Your bitcoin is not on your hardware wallet. It is on the 10k+ nodes scattered around the globe. The hardware wallet just manages your private keys. If you have your 24 word seed (seed and passphrase are different things) you can regenerate your private keys on a different device and send transactions which the nodes will deem valid and the miners will process into blocks.

Remember that it isn't all "real" money. It's perceived money. All of it can't be sold at that price. The more people sell it the less people are willing to pay for it. You can never extract the full market cap out of a new coin.
In the case where a new coin plummets to zero, the first people to sell will gain money from those who buy and have their coins lose value later. People who sell later will gain less and those who buy it will lose less. This continues until the coin is worthless. The sum of what people gain or lose with the coin will be nowhere near the market cap the coin initially had.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:57:19
Since I don't know the size of your transaction I can't determine Sat/Byte that works out to, but it does look to be below 10 sat/byte. There are a lot of 0-5 sat/byte transactions out there, likely leftovers from a BCH transaction spam. Looks like you're lumped in with them and it will take a long time to process. Look in your wallet for that unconfirmed transaction and look for "Increase Fee", "Replace by Fee" or something to that effect. I don't know which wallet you use so that's all I can tell you.

I concur on the amount of anti-tax users on Reddit. Very dangerous to listen to them. They're cruising for a hostile audit big time. Reach out to IRS/GOV or a bitcoin knowledgeable tax accountant.
But in a non-professional nutshell, any time you sell BTC for USD (or directly for an altcoin trade) or purchase goods or services it is a taxable event valued in USD at the time it occurs. If you held that BTC for less than one year it is capital gains taxed at your income bracket. Longer than 1 year it is long-term capital gains at a lower tax rate (15% for most people).
Also be aware that if you held BTC and received BCH in the Bitcoin Cash fork, all the BCH you received is taxed as regular income the moment you had access to it (whether you did something with it or not).
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:11:58

You're right, there is no specific guidance for fork air dropped coins. But BTC tax accountants say that of the existing IRS guidance the one that most closely matches is that for mining new coins. That guidance states that when new coins are created they are taxable income at their value in USD the moment you receive access to them (not the moment they are created). This probably has a lot to do with why Coinbase users won't have access to their BCH before Jan 1, the first day of the new tax year. It gives the IRS an additional year to publish specific guidance and gives hindsight with whatever happened to people who had access the year prior.

I know it would be cool to mine with your extra power but unfortunately you will lose quite a bit of money doing it. Here's why.
The infamous Chinese mining farms that are raising the difficulty rates are all located near hydroelectric plants. These hydro plants often have "excess water" which they end up releasing, bypassing their generators, because there is no demand for the electricity. The Chinese miners make deals with the hydro plants to buy bulk power at a low fraction of the price (like 35% of the rate I think, could be wrong). The hydro plants take the deal because they would otherwise just release the water making zero income. That's what you're competing against if you mine.
Your situation is different. You have a buyer for your excess power willing to pay 95%. You will not reach that level of income from mining. If your power company paid you 50% of current rate, only then do you start reaching a level where mining might be more profitable than selling power. If the power co stops buying excess power from you then definitely look into mining to recoup some of that lost revenue.

That's the beauty of it, you don't have to trust it. It's just a device that securely signs &amp; authorizes transactions offline from whatever device or service you connect it to. It does all of this based on your seed. The only thing you need to trust is that you never, ever lose your seed or have it compromised.
Remember, you bitcoin is NOT on the Trezor. It's on thousands of decentralized nodes across the globe. One of them is sitting right next to me. The Trezor is just a secure authorization device which will allow you to send transactions for the bitcoin addresses you own which the nodes will accept. It's only a key. If you have your seed you can make yourself other keys, either with another Trezor or even a different device such as a smartphone app. It's the seed that is important, not the particular hardware.

Yes, too long in the eyes of the users though. It's not taking too long to implement from an engineering perspective. When off chain solutions are put into place they must be rock stable. That takes time.

Yes, it's safe to send BCH to the Trezor. Much safer than holding it on an exchange. Don't worry about the stories, that sort of thing mainly happens when you're rushed and careless. Just be calm and methodical. Make sure you are not confusing BCH and BTC and insure you have the correct coin's wallet open. Double check the addresses every step of the way. You will be fine. To be extra cautious start by sending a small amount to the Trezor first as a test. I would also recommend wiping the Trezor with a very small amount inside and insure you can recover the Trezor from the seed you have written down and stored in a safe place.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:56:25
You can import keys but as other user said they will not be backed up by your recovery seed. If you are not pressed for time you can monitor the mempool at a site such as  and put in a low-fee transaction when miners only have low fees left to include in blocks.

You are greatly overestimating Bitcoin's anonymity. It is only pseudonymous. At some point your transaction chains will reach identifiable wallets where the IRS can subpoena information. Then transactions with an exact timestamp can be traced to other previously unknown wallets. If some of those funds haven't moved since the BCH fork, the BCH coins will have the same address and can be tracked into the BCH chain as well.

There is a fixed amount of Bitcoin. Only 21m will ever exist. The more people buy them the more scarce and more valuable they become.
Think of it like buying land in Manhattan. There is a fixed amount of land. Back in the 1600's when very few people where there the entire island could (and was) bought for beads and blankets. As more people came to Manhattan the more scarce land became. Fast forward to today and people pay millions for a box sitting on dozens of other boxes on a tiny postage stamp of land. Why? Because due to increased demand of a fixed quantity of land, land in Manhattan is now very scarce and very valuable.
You are doing the Bitcoin equivalent of showing up to Manhattan in the 1700s, when midtown didn't exist, and buying an acre of land.

At this time it's pretty unlikely that the transaction will get processed. But don't worry, it's not lost forever. I would say it's 95% likely that the transaction will sit in the mempool for 2 weeks and get returned to your sending wallet. 5% likely that the transaction will end up getting processed and go where you sent it to. Either way it will not be lost forever so don't panic.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:52:38
It doesn't work like that. You are mixing up aspects of Replace-By-Fee and Child-Pays-For-Parent. Replace-by-fee requires that the funds and recipient wallet remains the same. Only the fee is increased and the new transaction replaces the old transaction in the mempool. Only the higher fee transaction will be recorded in a block.
Child-Pays-For-Parent is a 2nd transaction sent by the original recipient before the original low-fee transaction is confirmed. The 2nd transaction has a higher fee and pays for the original low-fee transaction so both transactions are included in a block.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:50:10
I've read instructions from Bitcoin tax professionals that say IRS stock split guidance doesn't apply because you don't end up with two of the same thing with half value. There is no direct guidance for air drop forks but what they say is the closest match is the guidance for Bitcoin mining where you create and possess a new coin. That is taxable income the moment you have access to it. So when BCH split it is taxable as income at it's USD value when you first had access to it. After that it becomes capital gains with a base of what you reported as income.
Ultimately what BCH did was make every US citizen tell the IRS how much Bitcoin they are holding. I'm not very happy about that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:01:43
You're competing against operations with economy of scale and very favorable power arrangements. For example, Chinese miners buy bulk power in side deals with hydroelectric plants. Buying power generated from water that the plant would otherwise release. Better to get a little bit of income than let the water bypass your generators altogether.
So unless you have the ability to compete with this then mining isn't worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:42:21
I understand and actually agree with your hesitation... for now. Primarily because there remains a scaling issue. Solutions are on the horizon but ultimately they are still vaporware and thus risk. Even after they materialize, reducing risk, they remain untested and yet-to-be attacked in the real world, which is still risk. While I do have confidence this is still a bottom line reality which can't be ignored. (which many newcomers do ignore)
I think the biggest long-term risk to Bitcoin (after the S2X fork in the short term) is if Bitcoin's network-effect popularity outpaces its technical ability to scale. That will create a perception and confidence problem which could take years to shed. So I thank you for your hesitation as Bitcoin can only afford to be so popular right now. Not until proven Layer 2 scaling solutions exist.
Finally, don't be fooled by big-block (S2X) scaling solutions. These scaling solutions may be a valid scaling solution for the short term but they are a dead-end. Very short sighted as this sort of solution cannot possibly scale to the point where Bitcoin needs to scale. Not even gigantic centralized fiber-linked datacenters can handle the block size that will be eventually required by Bitcoin's scale. They are a short sighted serial solution. Only a Layer 2 parallel scaling solution can handle what Bitcoin can become.

You can't fake a block per se. Blocks are either determined to be valid or not valid by other nodes. I assume what you're talking about is altering the transactions of a block. Well, it's a block *chain*. 
If you want to remove a transaction confirmed 3 weeks ago so it's like it never happened you could go back to that block and re-hash it without the transaction. But since it's a block *chain* that would invalidate every block after that, which would make it much shorter than the valid chain and all nodes would discard it.
The only way to successfully do that is re-hash the block with the transaction you want eliminated, and re-hash the 3 weeks of blocks that came after it, all while doing this faster than the rest of the Bitcoin network can create blocks so the fake chain is longer than the real chain. Not only is it extremely difficult, it's also cost-prohibitive, it will significantly impact difficulty and since it's a public ledger someone will definitely notice what you're up to. 
That's not the danger of quantum computing. The danger is that quantum computing may be powerful enough to crack SHA-256 encryption allowing an attacker to find the private keys of addresses. That will allow the attacker to generate fake *transactions* not *blocks*. That would make a mess. How do we protect it? Switch to a stronger encryption protocol. Which will happen at the appropriate time.

As a settlement layer it won't be $5 per TX. It just needs to be brought to 1 settlement per 100 TXs and you get scaling increased by two orders of magnitude and fees reduced to 5 cents per TX.
Major on-chain transactions would have a high fee but you would only do that for high value transactions in which the on-chain fee is very reasonable and competitive with bank fees.

You're thinking in terms of residential electrical billing. Large mining operations have contracts with power companies where they guarantee steady consumption in exchange for a lower rate.

A fundamental counter to "govt will ban bitcoin" arguments is that bitcoin extends beyond the jurisdiction of every government.


If it happens it will be a huge mistake that won't last long. People will use foreign exchanges which make it easier for US citizens to evade the IRS. It will be much harder to conduct international business with the US, further reducing tax revenue. Bitcoin may start to replace the USD as the world's reserve currency. If the US bans BTC exchanges on American soil, the US could be left behind.


Again, shooting themselves in the foot. Bitcoin is global. It will continue to grow with or without the US. On or off US soil. Do you think big companies would accept losing international business because of government pressure?
Bottom line, Bitcoin is a disruptive "adapt or die" technology. If a nation steadfastly refuses to change in the face of it, they will no longer be a global player.

The 80% are just signaling intention for S2X. It's not a commitment. Some miners have made statements that do not coincide with their signaling. It may just be a matter of not wanting to take the time to change their signaling. We could very well see miners continuing to mine BTC after the fork while still signaling S2X. The signaling rate is a very dubious predictor of what will move to S2X fork.

Exactly. In the Nov 2013 scenario you would either need to sell and pay off the financing (if you see the drop coming) or re-fi and extend to give it time to recover. Luckily BTC is more stable now and it would take more than just a single exchange going insolvent for that to happen. (Still possible though so beware)

I have seen that article before and it's a very good read. Thanks for "linking". What it tells me is that there is no single "magic bullet" solution to scaling. Big blocks gets ridiculous when scaled to global micro transactions, to the point where even massive fiber connected datacenters will struggle to be nodes. Lightning is good for recurring micro payments but sees challenges when the scale of everyone-to-everyone expands globally. Scaling is *not* solved.
This is why I still don't see Banks becoming obsolete. In their current form, yes, but I still see Bitcoin needing evolved Bank entities to fit the "Decentralized with Centralized Hubs" model. I don't think this is bad either. If Layer 1 is limited within reason, it allows any power user to participate in governance and that's likely decentralized enough. Since it's all rooted in Bitcoin it's still a unilateral global system. User governance of Layer 1 will keep Layer 2 Bank entities playing by the Bitcoin rules. In spite of the anti-bank/1% rhetoric of many, that really is what Bitcoin is all about. Stop 99% from playing by one set of rules, and 1% by a different set of rules. 100% playing with the same rules. Mathematically enforced fairness, not revenge. 
Ultimately, this is exactly why I'm not moon-blind. A true scaling solution has not coalesced yet. Nor do I think one ever will. I think it will be multiple scaling solutions working in concert. Without technical scaling, moon-level price scaling won't happen either.
Edit: Spelling and clarification

That's why it's a middle ground. Some of your BTC earnings will be consumed in USD interest. As long as BTC earnings exceed the interest rate, at the end of the financing period you will hold more BTC than you would if you bought it outright at an earlier date.

Bitcoin's fees are a direct result of scaling. People are using it and fees have risen because everyone using it is competing to have their transactions processed sooner than other people. If half of the people using bitcoin just stopped using it, fees would go back to zero again.

It is not foolish to think that bitcoin *can* have the same returns next year, nor is it wise to think that bitcoin *will* have the same returns next year. There are many things that bitcoin is similar to but nothing it is identical to. Ultimately it is an experiment. Nobody knows how a deflationary currency behaves in the real world or what it is susceptible to. Nobody knows how an absolutely fixed limited commodity trades on large scale, its never existed before. At this point what it will do is only theory. So far bitcoin is following Metcalf's Law. That was created to describe the value of Ethernet networks but so far it's correlating bitcoin very well. If it continues to follow the pattern, it will grow in value exponentially until it reaches about 35% of its final saturation. Then growth starts decreasing exponentially. So based on that it *can* have the same returns next year (It's nowhere near its potential final saturation).
But that's no guarantee so it is still wise to know that it *can* deviate from Metcalf's Law for unforeseen reasons. Nothing like bitcoin has ever existed before so nobody really knows how it will play out. Best anyone can have is an educated guess.

I'd contend that things are a little different. Bitcoin *is* a good store of value, it's tempered globally and policies of a single government cannot impact it unilaterally. Bitcoin *is* a good medium of exchange, transactions are frictionless and uncensorable globally. What Bitcoin is suffering from is a 2+ year delay in scaling development as a result of the scaling debate, while network effect popularity continued unfettered. It is being congested by the much larger amount of people who know about it. Scaling technology needs to get over the debate and catch up. It's just not ready to scale to the level of popular demand.
This is why I don't support S2X. It's just a temporary placebo that only works as a short term serial scaling strategy that can't possibly scale to the long term popularity demand. Layer 2 parallel scaling technologies is the only solution that meets long term demand.
It's far better to maintain the Layer 1 congestion and force Layer 2 parallel solutions into existence now than to allow more users, more popularity demand, more market cap and more at stake when Layer 2 solutions inevitably become necessary. There is such a thing as being too popular for your own good.

That may be because it isn't a flowing currency yet. This is a completely new technology without precedent and its functionality isn't fully developed yet. You need to take all your expectations with a grain of salt and let your mind be adaptable to what it may become. 
I see bitcoin flowing into the financial world like a rising tide. It will flow into new areas as it becomes useful for that area. Right now the tide is flowing into the low ground of the store of value arena. Development will continue and it will become useful in new areas, and other new areas, and so on. As for the flowing currency application, we're not there yet because I can be 99% sure that I can't use it as a currency at any given vendor. That will change as development continues as it will add functionality and make it easier to use. That will drive adoption and we will see a flowing currency once it has more users to flow between.

The numbers that matter are those most directly related to the collective will of bitcoin users. The client &amp; node software users choose to run, which forks are listed on exchanges (which are rooted in what users want), and the value the user market gives each fork. Miners, developers and even exchanges cannot go against the will of the collective user base.

A single ISP can block the default port but there is nothing stopping nodes from using any other port. Just add a line to bitcoin.conf. It will amount to nothing more than an annoyance.
An ISP could identify and block all P2P traffic but that will cause customers all sorts of problems now as many legitimate services use P2P including games and Windows 10. If they could have gotten away with this they would have done it when P2P first became popular.
So IMO this is unlikely to be anything more than a annoyance that can be easily circumvented.

Bitcoin isn't a stock so looking at it like a stock bubble doesn't really fit. Bitcoin increases in value through user adoption. User adoption happens through the "network effect" which follows an S curve. This means that adoption increases exponentially from 0-50% adoption then decreases exponentially from 50%-100%.
Bitcoin price is following a user adoption S curve almost perfectly. The only exception is where it starts to exceed the S curve, then pulls back below the S curve, then recovers to join the S curve again.
So to answer your question, sometimes Bitcoin does bubble but it's not large and a small correction returns it to the S curve adoption line. What people have trouble seeing is how the exponential S curve is actually normal for new technology adoption, mainly because it has never been tied to a $ price before. Previously it was just the number of users which people didn't pay as close attention to as a price.

It depends on what measure you use to value Bitcoin. The amount of Bitcoin is finite and the total value on Earth is also finite. So the purchasing power of Bitcoin has a finite upper limit. That upper limit is theoretically $10 million/BTC in 2017 USD. That is the amount of value on Earth divided by the 21 million Bitcoin.
BUT we are currently valuing Bitcoin in measure of fiat currency which is not finite. USD tends to lose 2% of its value every year. Possibly more if there is high inflation. As Bitcoin grows to an all-encompassing default global currency it will pressure USD and accelerate the devaluation of all fiat currency. So if you measure Bitcoin in fiat currency it can go to infinity, not because of infinite buying power of Bitcoin but because of the decreasing buying power of fiat.
For example, we may reach 1 BTC = $10 million USD, but by then $10 million USD may only buy you a modest house and not the mansion estate that it would buy today. So buying power is the real measure of BTC and it is finite. Fiat is a bad measure of BTC as its buying power will change (decrease) over time.

First of all, anyone can see transactions coming into your donation address. You need to make sure this isn't a social engineering attempt to get you to give away a large legitimate donation. The person needs to prove that they own the address that the donation was sent from.
They would do this by creating a message with their wallet. They should state who they are, that the donation was sent in error, they request the bitcoin returned and an address to return it to. They would then create a signature for the message using the private key of the address the bitcoin was sent from. 
You would then validate the signature using the Public Key of the address that sent you the donation. If the signature validates, then you know the person who sent you this message also knows the Private Key of the address the donation was sent from and the message was not altered. Very safe to say that this is the same person who sent you the donation in error and you can send it back to wherever they want it to go.

Step by step instructions. All that matters is the addresses that held BTC at the time of the fork. The BCH will still be in the addresses of your Bitcoin Core wallet that were sent to the online exchange. You can look on the exchange to find the addresses where the BTC were sent from, then find the private keys for those addresses in the Bitcoin Core wallet, then add those addresses to a BCH SPV wallet.

I'm curious why you don't see this as a confirmation of bitcoin's strength? 6-10 powerful people attempted to steer bitcoin with a large majority of mining power. Instead of steering bitcoin they found that without user support all they could do is create a fork (which anyone can do, btw). They then called it off because of the low probability of success and high probability of a financial loss. Sounds like a proof of bitcoin's resiliency to me.

Bitcoin is a protocol, not a client. So Bitcoin will be like Ethernet. You just set up an Ethernet network, what brand of network cards and routers you use doesn't change the Ethernet. But some cards and routers are better than others. Bitcoin clients, wallets and nodes will be the same way.
It may not seem like it now but it does parallel "protocol wars" rather closely. The younger the protocol is the more individual companies can influence it. Over time that influence declines.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:08:10
I'd say there is two reasons for lack of skepticism. The first is that there has been an increasing influx of newer bitcoiners who are still learning about it but are very aware and enthusiastic of the price chart. The second is that there are also long timers who have seen bitcoin overcome obstacle after obstacle, disaster after disaster, nicknaming it the "honey badger of money". You will see concerns discussed here but they tend to be drowned out during price upswings.
I do not see a similarity to the .com bust because that was a sector of companies, many of which were a solution in search of a revenue stream. Many needed to be weeded out. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a company or a product. It doesn't need a revenue stream, it gains value by increased adoption and there are many ways it can be adopted. It can be a store of value, a currency, remittance channel, any company can build their products on top of it. Many of those companies can fail in a .com type shakeup but bitcoin will survive and the protocol can be used by other companies better products.
Being globally decentralized it is extremely difficult to regulate. It extends beyond the borders of every regulatory body. If a nation regulates or bans it, it will ultimately be to that nation's peril. Bitcoin will grow outside of that nation's borders leaving that country behind until it decides to catch up. But then it's a day late and a dollar short so to speak. At a disadvantage to the rest of the world. Bans are also hard to enforce, Bitcoin transactions have many routes to the blockchain. To block them one would have to take a North Korea approach and ban the Internet and cell networks. No first world country can afford to do that.
Yes, there are risks. Cracking SHA256 would be catastrophic but not just to Bitcoin, pretty much all internet security would catastrophically fail and we would have much bigger problems. However Bitcoin has existed in wild of the Internet, on the front lines, completely available to anyone and it has not been hacked. I was more concerned about the S2X fork as that is more of a social threat. Still, the more I thought about it, bitcoin could survive in any of the potential outcomes.
Ultimately I see Bitcoin flowing like water through the financial world taking the path of least resistance. It will pool here and there. Then begin to flood other markets and use cases. I'm very hard pressed to find something, anything, that can willfully stop it if the protocol has any use in an area. The only apparent response to it adapt or die, and that's quite remarkable.

I'm going to twist your brain here and take your USD thoughts to a new dimension.
Suppose you outright bought a Tesla Model S for $75k one year ago today. That would have cost you 101.871 BTC.
If you financed the same Tesla in one year ago today at an outrageous 20% interest for 12 months. Monthly payment would be $6948. Interest cost would be $8371 for a total cost (price, interest, tax, fees) of $88,926.31. Holding bitcoin and paying a loan with outrageous interest rates with the bitcoin you held would only have cost you 47.985 BTC. *Less than half!*
The best option would be to wait a year and buy the Tesla today. That would only cost 9.078 BTC but then you wouldn't have enjoyed your Tesla for the past year.
So bottom line, buying things outright with bitcoin is throwing money away. Finance it and delay payment as long as possible, even at outrageous interest rates. As long as bitcoin gains % exceed interest rate % you will be better off. If that stops happening then pay the loan off early to avoid further interest.

When you make a Bitcoin transaction you are sending the entire contents of an address to two addresses. The first being the address of the party you are paying in the amount you want to send. The second is a change address which is a new address which you've generated for yourself to hold the "change" left over from the original address. (Transactions do get more complicated than this but I'm limiting this to a basic explanation)
Since nearly every time you send or receive bitcoin you end up with new addresses and private keys, you can see how this can get out of hand and you need something to manage this. That's the important function that a wallet serves, keeping track of all your addresses and keys so you don't have to. You just care about the total sum of bitcoin in your wallet and the wallet app takes care of the address and key details.

You are also "voting" on consensus rules based on what client your node is running. You say you run Bitcoin Core, therefore you are enforcing the Core rules and you would only accept blocks from miners that are valid under those rules. If you supported S2X instead you would uninstall Bitcoin Core and use a node client that supports the S2X rules and only accept blocks from miners that are valid under S2X rules.
So you are both supporting the network and enforce a particular set of validation rules. The amount of nodes that enforce the same rules as you is what comprises consensus.

That doesn't make sense at all.
* If China throttles power to mining operations then the global hashrate is reduced, not skyrockets. This will cause new blocks to take longer than 10 minutes, not less.
* When the global hashrate changes up or down the difficulty of the network is adjusted every 2016 blocks to return to an average of 1 block every 10 minutes.
* Coinbase does not release new bitcoins. New bitcoins are rewarded to miners who do the proof of work to find the next block. Coinbase is a market and only has bitcoin that someone puts on the market for sale.
* If there is a sudden wild upward swing in hashrate it would only increase the block rate for a couple days.
* If there is a sudden wild downward swing in hashrate it would only slow down the block rate for a few weeks. But everything would keep working and go back to normal.

There is nothing wrong with 2MB except that it will be a hard fork, meaning that all nodes must upgrade or two separate chains will emerge. That needs to be avoided.
Going back to 1MB later is a very bad idea as it will be a hard fork and a soft fork to get right back to where it was. It's risk with zero purpose.
I support remaining at 1MB for the following reasons:
* Avoids the risk of a hard fork
* Limits the exponential adoption rate until the backing technology is ready for it. There is risk in adoption increasing too quickly.
* Promotes the anticipation and adoption of true Layer 2 scaling options which are the only viable path to widespread adoption. Better to have constraints now with few people than constraints later with many.

Bitcoin is a store of value with a finite amount of coins to distribute that value among. The more people use bitcoin as a store of value and trading currency the more valuable bitcoin becomes due to scarcity. So it's not absurd at all. It's not like the stock of a company that needs to increase profits. It's more like the market price of land in Manhattan. In the 1600s when land needed to be shared among a couple thousand people, land was plentiful and cheap. Nobody will pay a premium for land since there is so much to go around. Fast forward to today when 1.6 million people vie for the limited amount of land in Manhattan and land becomes much more valuable due to scarcity. Someone will pay more to purchase the land instead of someone else.

Well, the market cap doesn't necessarily mean nothing. If you're buying and selling goods with Bitcoin, using it as a currency, all Bitcoin holders could simultaneously purchase goods worth a value up to the market cap. The value is retained in Bitcoin and the term market cap makes a lot more sense in this context. Its when you trade Bitcoin for another pure store of value, i.e. USD, is when the value leaves Bitcoin, the price goes down and the market cap decreases.

I'd be willing to bet that if S2X had the users and the market, and not core or miners, S2X would be Bitcoin.

It's ridiculous to say Core controls Bitcoin. When one builds a node or chooses a wallet, one chooses whose code to run and what version. There are options. S2X was one of the options. It's a User vote for consensus rules. Very few voted for S2X and that's that.

Exactly. People are reluctant to change, especially where money is concerned. But sooner or later a significant group of everyday people (not scattered early adopters) will be in a position to say "Lets try this. What have we got to lose?". If crypto can handle the commerce, another group will more likely to get on board and the next group more likely still. Each time crypto gets stronger until it is sitting at the same table as the major players. Will crypto then take over the major fiat currencies? I don't know. I also think it doesn't really have to.

Same thing applies in reverse. If you know your passkey has been compromised you could evacuate your funds into another wallet and generate a new seed before the seed is compromised as well. The key thing here is that seed and passkey are separated and there is something to alert you as soon as either are compromised. Then the only way to steal funds is to compromise both simultaneously which should be significantly more difficult.

Bitcoin will never reach $100,000,000. The world economy isn't big enough. The theoretical maximum is $10,000,000. This is the entire global economy (valued in USD) divided by all the bitcoins (21 million). That would make 1 satoshi 10 cents, or at least the buying power of 10 cents because at that price USD would no longer exist. All global transactions must be in Bitcoin.

I'm not so sure about Joe Sixpack in regard to inflation/deflation. Sure, he can be easily snowed by those who want to keep him in debt. Those who understand interest collect it, those who don't pay it. But at the same time once the concept takes root that his PBRs tend to go down in price instead of up, that would be quite appealing. Joe Sixpack may finally understand how much better off he is when not paying interest on debt as well. More PBRs for Joe and Coors Light for his fancy GF. But I may be overestimating Joe here. Some Joes can be quite dumb when it comes to money.
You are absolutely right about fees. Joe Sixpack really hates fees. However, I don't see Joe Sixpack doing direct on-chain transactions regularly. Joe Sixpack hates waiting for confirmations too so Joe will want to live on Layer 2 leaving on-chain for the "big money people". I honestly don't know how well Layer 2 transactions such as Lightning will dilute the higher fees of on-chain transactions. I can only hope it dilutes them enough for Joe Sixpack to be mildly understanding of fees even though he still hates them. 
Transaction fees are an area where I think Bitcoin might be too honest for Joe Sixpack. Joe Sixpack already pays much higher fees but he doesn't realize it because it's designed so that retailers bake it into the price he pays for beer. It's hidden from his perception. Transitioning to a smaller fee but highlighted as a separate line item that Joe Sixpack pays will not be readily understood. 
I suspect that to satisfy Joe Sixpack's aversion to transaction fees someone will come up with a way to obfuscate them. I don't know, maybe an annual fee which covers fees. Maybe advertisements pay for transaction fees. Or maybe Joe need to mine Bitcoin for a bit. Don't ask me how, I'm more technically minded that socially minded. I am pretty confident that someone will come up with a way for Joe Sixpack to pay fees without realizing it.
And thank you for bringing Joe Sixpack into this. Talking about Joe Sixpack is kind of fun.

0 sat/byte (free) is definitely possible and used to be the norm many years ago. But, miners have always been free to choose whether to include these transactions in blocks or not. Years ago they did include them. Today they may choose not to process zero-fee transactions as they are in a position to demand at least some minimal fee. After all, you are giving them zero incentive to bother with your transaction. 
Zero fee transactions may very well process now but you will need to wait until a zero fee friendly miner is the one who finds the next block. I don't know what percentage of blocks are mined by zero fee friendly miners at this point but that can be determined by reviewing blocks for inclusion of zero fee transactions. It's rather safe to assume that percentage is less today than it was years ago when most miners included them.

You may be right that people underestimate the true power of governments. Still, Bitcoin is going to present a very interesting opponent. Here's why.
No government has full jurisdiction over the distributed Bitcoin space or a major part of any critical piece of it. It will require the full cooperation of multiple governments. Full cooperation between governments has historically been difficult (even between branches of the same government). Governments will also investigate how the balance of power could shift with a move to Bitcoin. Since there definitely will be a shift in the balance of power after moving to Bitcoin, it will be in the best interest of several governments to overtly or covertly not cooperate.
Bitcoin is decentralized across the fabric of the Internet, which all major economies are now dependent upon. The collateral economic damage of blocking Bitcoin and all possible circumvention paths is simply too damaging to consider. Bottom line, Bitcoin can't be blocked without devastating the fiat economy.
History has proven, in many countries and forms of government, that prohibition of something in demand at the grass roots level is never successful. Be it alcohol in the US, pirated voice-over translations of western movies behind the iron curtain, the war on drugs. Now that the pandora's box of Bitcoin is open it's like holding back the tide.
There has never been a greater threat to the true power of government authorities. It will be very interesting how this plays out.

Because professional traders have a plan. Selling just before hitting a round number is a common one. They're trying to beat the human nature of selling when it hits a particular value, then scoop up after the panic sell for a little extra profit. It's a higher risk, higher stress approach that can also get you higher profits if you time it right.

I disagree. Satoshi may have been wrong in hindsight but collapsing under the weight of your own success is a very real thing. At the time this was said, success was a very real risk to Bitcoin. It's still is a real risk. Bitcoin is not ready for an exponential explosion of use just yet. But it has recently taken a major step forward.

You can add **maxuploadtarget=** to your bitcoin.conf to limit your bandwidth. That will cause your node to stop distributing historical blocks over 1 week old once you reach a daily limit. Historical blocks are the big data cap eaters. 
I found that right now if you set **maxuploadtarget=20000** (max 20GB/Day) it will keep you a little under 1TB/month if that's your data cap. You may need to adjust that down depending on the amount of non-Bitcoin data you use. With that set you will likely be distributing historical blocks for around 12hrs on, 12hrs off.

Bitcoin gets value from a variety of reasons. Each will contribute to the overall value at different times. Ease of use will come. There are just bigger fish to fry first. Scaling is huge. We don't want Bitcoin to be easy to use yet else it will be a victim of its own success. The lightning network will be a major part of scaling. It will also improve the block confirmation delay. That's a problem for small quick transactions which needs a solution.
I guess my point is that I watched the Internet become the Internet. It wasn't pretty or easy before wide scale adoption. It was the realm of nerds.

Bitcoin is on a very similar trajectory.

Risky is not having a passphrase. Without one if someone gets access to your seed they have access to your coins. If you set a passphrase and they don't have it, they can only see an empty wallet or a decoy wallet with a small amount of coins.

They can't manipulate bitcoin to their needs. That is a big exaggeration. Bitcoin is decentralized and global which means it extends outside of any government's sphere of control. However governments can cause problems for their citizens as soon as transactions reach their sphere of control, the fiat currency. While I can certainly see why a government would want to do this, I believe actually doing it would be equivalent to shooting themselves in the foot. It will not be a good thing for a country if Bitcoin grows and progresses outside of a country's borders. That would only succeed in guaranteeing that the country and its citizens would be late adopters trying to acquire bitcoin when there is much greater competition.

I think this will be a bellwether of the onset of the Early Majority stage of adoption. It will first be seen in merchant locations that cater to a high amount of international travelers and tourists. Industry valuations and commodities will take a lot longer, I would estimate about halfway into the Late Majority stage of adoption. This would require BTC to make significant inroads to replacing USD as a major reserve currency.
Or at least that would be my guesstimate.

Not only has history proven that widespread cooperation between nations is extremely difficult, a shift to Bitcoin will alter the global balance of power. It's guaranteed that governments will evaluate the rebalancing of global power. Many countries will determine that it would be in their best interest to not cooperate and perpetuate the move to Bitcoin. For this reason alone no government can shut down a global decentralized cryptocurrency.

No worries. The passkey and pin are different things. The pin can be bypassed if you have the seed. The passkey is an additional encryption layer. With a Trezor using the passkey is optional. If you don't use the passkey then the seed is all someone needs. If you do use the passkey then your seed will just appear to be an empty wallet. Personally, I find it silly to buy a Trezor but not use a passkey.

It's a good thing you're not a stock analyst because Bitcoin is not a stock and it doesn't behave like one. It just seems to on first glance. It really just behaves like Bitcoin.
I won't give a number because we seem to be in a FUD attack, one thing after another. Eventually the FUD will lose it's teeth and Bitcoin will rise on its fundamentals. I can't say when or what news will show up tomorrow, so no price. I do look at the current price as a discount though.

Don't get it twisted, I'm not hating on the miners. What I'm really saying is that it's an industry space which requires a certain personality type. Type-A big egos will not be comfortable here because it just isn't the industry leading space that this personality type desires. But many big players in this space are just this type of personality and they find it confining and frustrating.
The personality type best suited to the mining industry is highly adaptable, efficient and service oriented. Someone who can see what direction users are or will head and adapt to service that demand. It's the opposite of making things happen, it's reacting to and anticipation of what users make happen.


There you have it. You're highly adaptable. Whatever direction the users may go, you'll be there to provide the mining services that they find most valuable. That's a personality type that fits mining. What I'm saying is a bad fit is the Type-A Big Ego that isn't happy unless they can say "I'm mining X and **I** made the users value it over Y".

If you can figure out a way it is, but that isn't easy. Sure you can buy bitcoin in one exchange and sell in another exchange at a better price. That's easy. But you also need to find a way to retrieve your fiat from the other exchange without profits being eaten up in fees, likely trading one fiat currency for another in the process. And you can't use Bitcoin to do it since you will just undo any profit going back the other way. So that's the rub. Not to say it won't be profitable but it's not a simple thing to work out consistently or quickly.

This. The fact is Bitcoin is not a finished product. It will not "take over the world" as it is today. It will also not remain as it is today. Every building that held the title of tallest building in the world started its existence as the shortest building in the world. They don't just materialize into existence. The question is does it have the foundation it will require? Are the building plans feasible? If the answers are yes you will find early adopter volunteerism helping construction. During construction, Transaction Fees will act as a built in regulating mechanism insuring that the on-board rate cannot exceed capacity. This is working perfectly for everyone with the vision to see what Bitcoin can be, not what it is.

Look at the BTC chart on BitcoinWisdom.com and educate yourself on what it all means. First, quantity of people has nothing to do with it. 1 person can buy/sell from/to many people. It's the amount of bitcoin being bought/sold and the available Ask/Bid price &amp; quantities that matters.   So if someone wants to sell 10 BTC immediately it has to be at price &amp; quantity of the available Bids (people willing to buy a particular quantity at a particular price). If  people only put up bids of a half or quarter BTC at a price near the current price you will need to dig deep into the Bid list to sell all 10. Each time you dig deeper into the bid list, the bid is at a lower price. Thus the price drops. Same thing happens on the way up as well.

By the time he figured out what he had to pay in USD, The USD value of his BTC/Altcoin portfolio crashed to below what he owed in taxes. He has a big problem. Ultimately for being stupid. By failing to convert to USD when he incurred the tax bill, he assumed all the downside risk while his IRS bill didn't. He can't even claim the loss because he waited until a different tax year.

Bitcoin has done this sort of thing from day 1. Bitcoin roller coaster dude exists for a reason. My decidedly non-trader viewpoint is that Bitcoin "breathes". Big inhale, exhale, big inhale, exhale. Getting bigger each time. In fact whenever a new ATH is reached I don't consider that a real number. The real price is about 25% less and it will probably dip to that at some point. When it does I'm just meh, expected. 
I completely agree it's scary at first but ride it out. Almost everyone dips into the red for a bit shortly after you buy. Soon enough you'll be in my position where selling at the bottom of the dip is still a heck of a lot higher than I bought in so I just don't care.

I don't think theorizing is silly at all. It's important to understand exactly what "The Moon" or "The Stars" is by calculating what 100% global economy penetration actually is. After all, this is the first time in human history that any form of tender had a remote shot at being a global currency.
At 1 BTC = 1 Million USD, the BTC market cap will only be 10% of the global economy. It's simply not worth enough to penetrate more than 10% of the global economic space. It also means that 1 BTC can never be more than the equivalent of $10 Million USD as the OP suggested. The global economy simply isn't big enough to contain BTC if its value was higher than that.
I don't mean to say I would ever expect to see this happen, certainly not in my lifetime. Probably won't ever happen. I'm just saying it's important to know what 100% of the global market is to obtain an accurate understanding of scale and potential market penetration. This is what I think the OP was attempting to do.

Well... have you considered the scenario where there aren't enough transactions to create blocks large enough for Core nodes to reject them? I'm sure transactions are going to drop come hard fork time as everyone waits for the smoke to clear. There could be BTC1 blocks that Core accepts, then some that Core doesn't accept. I'm trying to wrap my brain around what could happen there because AFAIK they are trying to hide any differentiation between Core and BTC1. So would it really be a split? Or just a mess?
Still trying to figure all that out.
Edit: Nevermind, my brain was twisted. It's not blocks that will get confused since the first 2X block will cause a fork and each will mine their own chain. It's transactions that can be broadcast to either node. So if you spend S2X the same transaction can be broadcast to BTC chain as well and you'll send both coins. Also vice-versa. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:42:57
You need to think about what the recovery sheet does. In a nutshell, it allows any Trezor to be converted into *YOUR* Trezor. It doesn't tell you the Pin or the Passphrase(s) so it is only one of 3 pieces of the key needed to access your BTC. (You're using a passphrase, right?) So to store it, follow these priorities.
1) You must always have a copy of your recovery seed. If your Trezor is destroyed or stolen you will lose access your BTC without it. Store multiple copies in multiple places where they are unlikely to be simultaneously destroyed in the same disaster.
2) The recovery seed doesn't necessarily need to be in an unstealable location like a safe (although that would be better) but it does need to be in a location where you will immediately know if it was destroyed, stolen or compromised in any way. This is so you can pull your BTC out of the Trezor and generate a new seed before anyone has time to figure out your Pin and Passphrase(s).
3) Never store your recovery seed, Pin and Passphrase(s) in the same place. Those are all 3 pieces of the key needed to access and steal your BTC. If only 2 of 3 are stolen (and you are aware of it) that gives you some time to empty the BTC on the Trezor to another temporary wallet before the 3rd can be hacked. Then you regenerate the recovery seed on your Trezor and then it's safe to refill it because what was stolen is now irrelevant to your Trezor.

For additional security. A paper wallet contains everything needed to access your coins. It's a single point of attack. It is also a single point of failure/loss (if you don't make copies of it) or multiple single points of attack (if you do make multiple copies). With a Trezor you can add passphrase encryption. That makes your recovery seed or passphrase not enough to access your coins. You need both. Store your recovery seed and passphrases in different locations so an attacker must find and compromise both to gain access. It also makes it safer to have multiple copies of each so you don't lose any of them completely in a single disaster.

It seems clear that S2X is taking a highly hostile attack approach to the fork. The biggest weakness of BTC is to look at the market pricing of BTC/S2X futures and consider it ignorable. BTC needs to be thinking in terms of a counterattack or pre-emptive attack instead of just relying on the "castle walls" and market value to overcome this attack.

I think you're underestimating Bitcoin. It's not just one thing, it's a protocol. Just like TCP. There are also many other competing protocols in the crypto space, those are the alt coins. That's a major part of Bitcoin's investment risk. Will it remain the dominant protocol?
I continue to say Lightning is imminent and discussions like that one make me very positive about its success. My biggest takeaway of that discussion is that the developers are very aware of their place in history. They are at the nexus of the Butterfly Effect. The design decisions they make now can have a huge impact on the shape of the future world. They are being conservative and are prioritizing getting it right. Exactly as they should, IMO. As an engineer I completely understand their reluctance to provide a timeframe. Time is not important compared to getting the design right. This is uncharted waters. There is no white paper to follow. Their extremely thoughtful discussion while balking on an artificially imposed timeframe is exactly what I want to hear. I want Lightning Network and I want it right. Not now.

What, no mention of finding a very cheap or free source of power so it's not cheaper to just buy them instead? New people, it's not this simple. Mining is a very slim profit margin. You can easily spend more on power than the value of the bitcoin you get through minimg. Its been that way for years.

Off chain systems rely on the main chain as the coin management root and to settle many transactions in the off chain with a summary transaction on the main chain.

This statement right here proves the diabolical genius of the banking industry. Banks are absolutely NOT free. In fact, their fees are both high and numerous but the consumer who pay the fees has no clue they are paying it.
The banks charge the merchant:
* Bank - Avg of 2.1% + $.10 per transaction
* Processor - Avg of .25% + .10 per transaction
* Terminal fees (leased card readers)
* Payment Gateway Fees (e-commerce)
* Payment Card Industry compliance fees
* Annual Fees
* Early Termination Fees
* Monthly Fees
* Monthly Minimum Fees
* Statement Fees
* IRS Report Fees
* Online Reporting Fees
* Network Fees
Merchants are also charged incidental fees:
* Address Verification Services (per transaction)
* Voice Authorization Fee (doesn't occur often)
* Retrieval Request Fee (initiate customer dispute)
* Chargeback Fee (fee in addition to losing sale)
* Batch Fee
* NSF Fee (merchants get hit with overdrafts too)
The only way for a merchant to pay all these fees is to increase the price of their goods, so the consumer pays it. 
*Yet the consumer still thinks using banks is free!*
Pure diabolical genius. They even get the consumer to rant about Bitcoin because it dares to be honest and upfront about it's one single low transaction fee.

It will add to volatility initially as the amount of funds they're buying and selling will be a greater pct of liquidity.

It's not dangerous at all. It's how it really is. Bitcoin is nothing more than a high level protocol that integrates with TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) which integrates with IP (Internet Protocol), just like HTTP, FTP, POP, IMAP, SMB and many others. Bitcoin is not at all unusual or revolutionary at this level, nor should it be. It's a standard protocol listed on the Wikipedia Lists of Network Protocol page. 
"Crypto" is not a protocol or an actual thing. It is a descriptive term for a catagory of independent but competing network protocols which include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Doge, and many others. 
So companies who build services on top of a network protocol are the horses. You can place bets on the horses by buying the company stock. You profit only if that particular company succeeds and grows. 
The network protocols are the racetrack. You can place bets on a particular racetrack by buying Bitcoins, or Ether, or other Altcoins. Each is a different network protocol, or in this analogy racetracks. You profit if one or more of the horses on that racetrack succeeds and expands the demand for that particular network protocol. 
"Crypto" is not a thing. It's just a catagory of competing racetracks. You cannot place bets on "Crypto" where you will profit if any Crypto protocol succeeds, at least not directly.

I think the key factor in governments being unable to stop Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is global, borderless and decentralized. Sure a government can stop it within its borders, maybe even have an influence outside its borders. But unless every government cooperates in unison, Bitcoin will not be stopped.

China has a national firewall which makes it feasible to effectively enforce a ban. Nearly every other country will have a much more difficult time of it.

With the USD as the world's primary reserve currency Bitcoin will compete whether it's banned in the US or not. Since its competition regardless, you might as well let it grow as much as possible within your borders so you can tax it.

This only applies to the Keynesian school of economics. There is an entire school of thought (Austrian) which says the exact opposite. In spite of what a Keynesian government says, they really only find deflation to be really bad primarily for 2 reasons.
* The government can no longer increase the money supply and distribute the new money however they want.
* Keynesian economics produces a system of debt because inflation decreases the real value of that debt over time. Deflation causes the real value of debts to increase over time. Deflation is very bad for those in debt and very good for those who aren't. Keynesian governments are very much in debt and require inflation to maintain the debt.

I'll counter that by pointing out that you are only looking at on-chain transactions. Off-chain transactions are being developed to specifically address the "buy a Coke with my Mastercard" scenario. Just because you don't worry about it doesn't mean nobody else does. A significant amount of the vendor's profit from selling the Coke is lost to Mastercard fees taken from the vendor, which is subtlety passed down to you in a higher price for a Coke. You also have to provide and transmit your identity information just to buy a Coke which can result in identity theft. So anyone with a brain can figure out that mastercard is quite bad for small purchases, there just isn't anything better... yet.

I think "complex math problem" is important to convey to a layman because the complexity makes it so you cannot make educated guesses.
Suppose you have a simple math problem where you're given 3 numbers and you need to guess a 4th so that all add up to 20. So you're given 2, 6 and 7 (but you don't know the actual numbers so you must guess). If you guess 4, you find the sum is 19. So now you know not to bother guessing 1, 2, or 3. You can make an educated guess, or in this very simple case you would know your guess is 1 short so you know to add 1 to your guess.
The hash algorithm is complex so that no matter how many guesses and results you have to review and evaluate, they don't help you narrow down your next guess. What is literally going on is that a bunch a computers are picking random number after random number and crunching the hash until one fits the criteria for a block. By design, there is no other way to do it.
That's why I think it's important for the layman to hear "complex math problem".

Well... hash power talks but money is it's lungs. Sure a large amount of hash power can move in their own direction. It doesn't mean users, nodes or markets have to follow them. It doesn't mean that users have to give the new direction any value. The users can be heard by continuing to value the NO2X chain and not valuing the 2X chain. Then all that hash power will be working on a chain that few are willing to buy into, defeating the purpose of mining.
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a noise?
It is still a major point of concern. I don't know exactly how this will play out. But I do know that the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem does not simply go wherever the miners go. The miners have delusions of grandeur here. If anything the miners go wherever the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem goes because that is where the profit is, which is the miner's true self-interest.

I think that many of the big miners got into it to be big powerful players in Bitcoin. Then the reality crept in that miners are actually subservient players in Bitcoin. By that I mean they are followers, not leaders.
**Developers:** Their role is to increase the efficiency of Bitcoin and expand the Bitcoin horizon with new features and functions. However they cannot force users to move to the horizons they create. In effect, they are only able to dangle carrots on a stick and hope the user base moves to bite them. If the user's don't value their developments, then their developments don't take hold.
**Users:** The central driving force and decision makers of Bitcoin. The users decide what developers they use. The users create transactions and offer fees. The users create the markets which gives value to Bitcoin. Every major decision in Bitcoin is ultimately decided by user consensus.
**Miners:** While they serve a critical role in securing the Bitcoin Network, it is only financially feasible to secure the network that the Users want and value. This makes Miners the most dictated group in Bitcoin. They must follow the markets established by the Users. Failure to follow what the Users value incurs a direct financial penalty. While needlessly unflattering, it is not unreasonable to call Miners the "bottom-feeders" of Bitcoin. They can only pick up the incentives offered by the markets as established by the Users. They cannot create their own or make their own determinations. This makes the entire Miner industry the financially bound slaves to the Users. The simply must do what the users want and offer to make a profit. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the Miner role is absolutely critical. So long as one understands the position of the role.
I think the language used by the Big-Blockers/S2Xers shows that the big mining players didn't expect the Miner position to be as it is. They thought they would be more powerful or even the most powerful, when in fact they are the least powerful group when it comes to steering Bitcoin. They are a powerful engine but they can't touch the steering wheel. They seem to be jealous of the Developers who create many new roads. But ultimately it's the users that decide which directions to go and the value it is worth.
IMO, I think this is an excellent balance of power.

It's astounding how people don't understand where the power is. It's very simple and the same process in almost every facet of life, follow the money. 
It's not the hash rate. It's not the nodes. The market is the where the money (or value) comes from. If the market doesn't value your coin because of its centralization, or its scaling roadmap, development code quality, or even just because you're a jerk, it doesn't matter if you have magic huge quantum hash power unicorns. They will continue to be an expense and they still will not force the market to come to you with money.
These miners need to learn their place. They follow the users and follow the market they create. Otherwise they are leaving the reason for their existence.

Incorrect on the first point, correct on the second. 
Some miners currently *think* they have all control but profit/loss is ultimately their master. Miners are heavily burdened by HW investments and power cost. Their investment ultimately needs to generate profit. If they put all of their hashrate on a chain that isn't valued by the markets (by users) their mining isn't profitable and they will head down the path of bankruptcy.
The mistake they are making is that they think Bitcoin has value because it has the miner's hash power. That's part of it but it isn't the bottom line. Bitcoin has value because users decide it has value. So regardless of the hash power behind a S2X chain, if the users decide that chain doesn't have value then the chain is worthless and won't bring a profit. No profit and the miner will be unable to afford to mine that chain for very long.
That's also the reason why it doesn't matter what the core devs want. The users don't have to run their code. If core devs want something the users don't want then whatever they code they write to accomplish their goals will not be run. If the NYA parties (S2X) hold closed-door meetings, decide the direction of Bitcoin and write code to support it (BTC1) The users will still decide if they will run that code.
So since users choose what Bitcoin implementation to run, and they determine the market price by buying or selling coins, it's the user that ultimately control's Bitcoin.

If you move coins on the BTC fork the transaction won't be on the BCH fork. So the coin would have moved on the BTC fork but not the BCH fork. The BCH coins will still be right where they were when the fork occurred. To move BCH it requires a transaction on the BCH fork.
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:29:54
You mention that *you* replay the transaction on the other chain to take those coins as well. But since BTC1 nodes can hide that they are BTC1 nodes, wouldn't a Core node end up unknowingly relaying the original Core transaction to a stealthed BTC1 node too? Thereby doing a replay on the S2X chain automatically? And vice-versa, assuming a stealthed BTC1 node will knowingly relay transactions to a Core node?
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:26:05
Thank you, I try to remain sane about it. :)
Here's the thing about hash power and value. It doesn't give it value *to the market* as much as it gives it value *to the miners*. So the question is if the hash power/difficulty ratio is enough to overcome whatever discount the market settles upon.
Bitfinex has just opened up a BTC/S2X futures market so we have some actual market numbers to consider now. The market is currently valuing the potential BTC/S2X chains at .75/.25 respectively. So miners will need to generate 3x more S2X coins to break even with the market valuation of the BTC chain without operating at a speculative loss. The amount of coins generated will change each time either chain has a difficulty adjustment. With each difficulty adjustment the bottom line value *to the miners* changes significantly and that will determine where hash power goes. So as I see it, S2X has a very short time period to convince the market to increase its S2X valuation and decrease its BTC valuation. If it doesn't then hash power will exploit difficulty adjustments, just like what happened with BCH, only it will be to a greater degree and more disruptive. 
Now will the market blame S2X for that disruption and continue to devalue it or will the market see S2X as "stronger" and increase its valuation? That is certainly debatable and ultimately an unknown as of now. However it's clear from the initial market valuation that S2X will be the chain with the uphill battle. It will have to make strong market gains quickly or the incentive for miners to return to the BTC chain to maintain their bottom line will become overwhelming.

How about this? If you are a miner that doesn't support S2X then signaling S2X would subvert the S2X effort by overestimating its actual hash power. Also, you will not receive any flak from the S2X camp until the rubber meets the road and you have to show your cards. The BTC camp already expects some miners to be false signaling so there will be much less flak from them. After all, it's just intention signaling. It isn't a guarantee that you will mine S2X.

You might want to add **maxuploadtarget=** to your bitcoin.conf. That way you don't limit connections, you just limit the amount of historical blocks (over 1 week old) that your node will distribute per day. That's the big data cap eater.

It's your seed that needs to be protected, not your Ledger. USBs can lose data in a variety of places for a variety of reasons. The Ledger itself is actually temporary disposable hardware. The seed is the key piece of information that everything is built upon. Determine a storage strategy that makes it extremely unlikely to lose that information and very likely that you will notice immediately if it is compromised. Think of every possible scenario. Fire, natural disasters, break-in, your own forgetfulness. Counter all of them so you never lose your seed and immediately know if someone else has obtained that information.

A node could not serve historical blocks at all (MaxUploadTarget=0). This would still be an effective node because it will still be serving the network of current nodes 100%. It's still verifying and validating all new transactions and blocks. Still propagating valid transactions and blocks via many connections to other nodes. It's a completely functioning part of the network of current nodes.
What it will not do is help new or behind nodes catch up to the current block and become a contributing current node. In this regard the node isn't helping the network, but it isn't hurting either since the node is providing other services. As long as limiting historical blocks is done out of necessity it is not hurting the network, especially if the options are limit historical blocks or do not run a node at all. 
To be clear, for a node to be helpful to the network it must be a "listening" node that can accept new "in" connections. Non-listening nodes only consume other node's bandwidth without providing any real benefit.
Your question inspires me to put up a node with MaxUploadTarget=0 and see how much of a data cap that would consume. It's nice to know what the current minimum data cap is.
I was able to get some ballpark data from my router. If I excluded the historical blocks by setting maxuploadtarget=0, my node would contribute about 3.2GB/day or 100GB/month towards my data cap with around 100 connections. So that would be the "lightest" node one could run by limiting historical blocks. You can also reduce bandwidth requirements further by limiting connections but that would reduce the effectiveness of your node.

The problem is that the IRS has zero guidance about how to handle an air drop fork and are completely lagging behind the technology, yet you must follow their rules. There are 3 IRS guidance statements that can apply here but none fit 100%.
Their stock split guidance might apply, but it really doesn't since you don't end up with two of the same thing but rather two different currencies. That makes it all very awkward and most say this guidance should not be followed.
You can treat it as an offshoot of a capital gains asset, with a cost basis of zero. Some think this is OK but it can be risky because it is related historically to the original asset (BTC) but unrelated after the fork. Will the IRS consider this a new capital gains asset or an extension of the original asset? Nobody knows.
If it's treated as a newly created asset (which is quite reasonable) then the IRS guidance for mining rewards becomes most applicable. The IRS considers mining reward coins to be a newly created asset and it is classified as immediately taxable income valued in USD at the moment you had access to it. It only becomes a capital gains asset after you receive it as income with the cost basis being the USD value you reported as income.

You are taking a risk because he needs to get through his teenage years without deciding to do something stupid with that information. Even the kindest most trustworthy kids have "WTF were you thinking?" moments in their teens and the answer is always "I don't know". Which is arguably an honest answer.
Personally, I would do the following.
Obviously, keep the hardware wallet, seed and passkey yourself.
Give half of the seed to someone you trust. Give the other half of the seed to someone else you trust. Give the passkey to a 3rd person you trust. Do not tell any of these people who the other two are and if possible pick people who don't know each other.
Then tell your son who holds which piece and they will only give it to him if you are incapacitated.
If you're extra paranoid that one of these 3 people will withhold their piece for a ransom, or they may just stupidly lose it, then choose 6 people with 2 people holding redundant copies of each of the 3 pieces. If your son can't get the information from one person for whatever reason there is another person to obtain it from. 
Finally, since this is a new concept to many people, contact all of the people on a yearly basis and ask them to recite their portion of seed or passkey so you know they still have it. That will give you an idea of how easy or difficult it will be for your son to get the pieces he needs after you're gone.

I sort of agree with you there. I expect that there will be difficulty gaming, but in slow motion compared to BCH and ongoing market value will weigh heavily into it. BCH's EDA was a crucial mistake as it made it possible to game difficulty so much that market value didn't really matter.
That's why I'm taking a very different approach between BCH and S2X. I sold my BCH right away, get it while the getting's good. There's a lot more risk doing the same with S2X. HODL and see would be a wiser approach here. Of course that will imapct markets, which will influence hash rate distribution, which will influence each chain's time-to-stability, which will impact markets...

That could be the case right now. If you're confident the price will rise post-fork you want to get in before that. But what will happen pre-fork? Will there be upward pressure from Altcoin funds moving to BTC for the fork? Will there be downward pressure from cashing out prior to the fork? DCA will average out much of that short-term uncertainty. DCA would have been very helpful in taking advantage of yesterday's dip.

What is dangerous is buying or transacting *during* the forks. If you buy now and move the coins to your own wallet (whose developers have a good fork plan) you will be fine and have coins on both sides of the fork. It won't matter which one wins. If you buy after the fork and wait until the smoke clears, you can buy on the winning fork.
Keep in mind that forks represent market uncertainty. Uncertainty puts downward pressure on the price. After the fork that uncertainty will be removed. 
IMO, I would buy before the fork but only if you can guarantee that you can move the coins to a wallet you control whose developers have a good fork plan before the fork happens. You definitely don't want all your coins on an exchange come fork time. Or maybe dollar cost average pre-fork and post-fork once the smoke clears. After the fork and once the smoke clears, I would guess that there would be buy pressure on the winning fork from everyone holding off for a while.
But this is only a guess, take it all with a grain of salt and make your own decisions.

Thanks. I understand the invalid blocks and the auto banning. As I understand it, Core 0.15.x bans BTC1 immediately if it isn't stealthed. If it is stealthed, Core 0.15.x will ban on the first 2x block it receives and that ban is for 24hrs. Wouldn't this still leave an ongoing 1 block window every 24 hours to propagate transactions across either chain resulting in automatic replays? TBH, I understand the block propagation process much better than the transaction/mempool propagation process. Even if the ban were permanent, it's only by IP so in theory every stealthed BTC1 node needs to connect to and send one 2x block to every Core node before that BTC1 node is completely banned from the 1x network. Not to mention the possibility of stealthed BTC1 nodes changing IPs. Which means that auto-replays can happen for quite some time. Is that right or am I missing something?
EDIT: I think I just thought out the answer to that. 2x blocks wouldn't be the only reason to ban the BTC1 node. As soon as it propagates an transaction originating from a 2x block the Core node would invalidate the transaction and ban the BTC1 node. I would assume that the Core node would then invalidate every transaction that the BTC1 node propagated. Thereby limiting auto-replays. Does that sound right?

You can compare with the Betamax/VHS video format war for some answers. Betamax had better video, better sound and a more stable image. In general it was a better quality video tape all around. It still lost.
Why? Betamax was only produced by Sony. VHS was licensed to many manufacturers. VHS had the network effect whereas Betamax didn't. That resulted in more competing manufacturers and lower cost.
Compare that to crypto. Bitcoin is VHS. It's not controlled by anyone. It has the network effect. Even if a better coin comes along it will likely not matter. If it is controlled by a single entity, it will likely lose to Bitcoin. If it's proprietary, it will likely lose to Bitcoin's many independent developers. Bitcoin already has the network effect and there is no barrier to joining &amp; developing that network. That's a huge hurdle for any other coin to overcome.

But if nobody is willing to buy the coins on that chain without a deep discount, there's no money in it to pay the bills and profit. You will need to move back to the more valued "slower" chain to hopefully break even.

Every Bitcoin transaction is traceable between wallets but who owns which wallet is unknown. That said, there are points in the paper trail where who owns particular wallets can be discovered. Points such as exchange KYC/AML data, confiscated wallets, cooperative merchants, ransom payment wallets, reported thefts &amp; scams, etc. There are enough of these points that it cannot be said that Bitcoin is untraceable.

That's a bit hyperbolic. The natural progression of a new currency is that it first establishes itself as a store of value. Bitcoin has accomplished this. Transactions are steadily increasing, only flat lining recently amid the scaling debate ebbs and flows which is understandable. Once scaling uncertainties are behind us transactions will likely continue it's upward trajectory.

Unfortunately it's worse than that. You didn't buy them, they were basically gifted to you as if you won them on a game show. That's not capital gains, that's income at your full tax rate valued at its current USD value at the moment you have access to them. When you sell/spend them it's capital gains/loss with the basis being its value when you first had access to them.

Bitcoin's problem is that it is completely honest about fees. You know without a doubt that you are buying a product for [Product Price] and you are paying [Transaction Fee] in fees to process the transaction. No question whatsoever.
Banks are not honest about fees. When you buy a product with a Credit Card the bank will tell you there are no fees. But the bank charges the merchant a heavy fee. So people think they are buying a product for [Product Price] with zero fees. What they're really doing is buying a product for [Product Price]+[Transaction Fees] and the transaction fees are much higher than Bitcoin. It doesn't even matter if you don't use a credit card. You're still subsidizing the fees of the credit card users because the transaction fees (which don't apply to you) are still baked into what you think is the product price.
Rather ingenious on behalf of the banks but it's a fleecing that Average Joe needs to be enlightened to.

I don't follow. There are many solutions which solve a block. Miners are not solving for an equals, they're solving for a less than. The complexity of the math problem makes it impossible to zero in on a nonce that will satisfy the hash value's less than difficulty criteria to be a valid block. The only option is to brute force random nonces until one works. That is the proof of work.

Instead of being regulated by a single, powerful and corruptible or hackable central entity with control over the network, Bitcoin is regulated by many decentralized entities of which none can obtain control over the network. Therefore for corruption to influence the network it requires the cooperation (intentional or unintentional) of a majority of the users. A significantly more difficult feat to accomplish. But the powerful central entities will never admit that.

The "too good to be true" aspect comes from the fact that Bitcoin is an entirely new thing that has never happened before in human history. Never before has the masses created a currency on their own without a government or a central location for government to shut it down. Distributing financial power instead of centralizing it.
The catch is that Bitcoin is an entirely new thing that has never happened before in human history. It's an experiment and nobody knows if it will ultimately work, what it will become, where it will go. There is no precedent. Something nobody can foresee can make it fail and become worthless. Bitcoin will either be extremely valuable or worthless. Nobody knows what will happen.

I'm not familiar with the Ledger but I believe it would have a passkey option. You are correct, don't lose your passkey. And don't lose your seed either. It can be game over either way. There is also another security purpose for passkeys. You can use multiple passkeys with the same seed. This protects you from the $5 wrench attack. (i.e. beat you with a $5 wrench until you tell them your passkey) 
You can use one passkey as your primary wallet holding the bulk of your coins. You can use another passkey as a decoy wallet holding a small amount of coins. If you are ever coerced into giving up your passkey, give them the passkey for the decoy wallet and let them steal that instead of your primary wallet. It's impossible to tell if you only have one passkey in use or many.

Users/core does think that's bad, but only temporarily bad. Miners have no chain loyalty and will switch if it is profitable to do so, as BCH proved.
It is unknown how the market will value S2X vs BTC. It is also yet to be seen how much hash power will move to S2X. Users/Core are under the belief that S2X will be valued much less than BTC, enough to prevent some miners from moving. They also believe that once the BTC difficulty is adjusted the financial draw to return to the BTC will be very strong, ultimately making the S2X fork a temporary disruption.

I don't see how this could even be a question. Increasing the 21m cap will debase Bitcoin. Debasing bitcoin is not in the best interest of anyone who owns bitcoin. It will be very safe to say that pretty much everyone who owns bitcoin will refuse to run a node that allows their bitcoins to be debased. It simply will not happen. If quantity of coins ever becomes an issue the obvious consensus among bitcoin owners will be to allow increased divisibility to additional decimal places, which will not debase their bitcoin holdings.

Bitcoin is taxed as a commodity, with cost basis at the time you acquire the bitcoin and profit/loss at the time you sell or spend it.

Yes. A paper wallet is literally a printed public and private key. Its the most basic type of wallet there is. It does nothing but sit there. You can't spend from it unless you sweep the entire amount into another wallet. The key part of it is that it is a completely offline cold storage method. Completely invulnerable to hacks or malware (if not compromised during creation) because it's disconnected and inaccessible.
A full featured wallet, which you made your 24 word seed for, will be online and while secure it is still accessible online. That means there will always be some risk of hacks &amp; malware.

Not necessarily worse. True, it does guarantee that you will not get the best possible price over your buy in period. It also guarantees that you will not get the worst possible price either. You do better than average though. Since the amount of BTC varies with DCA you will get more BTC when price is low and less when it is high. The end result is that your overall buy in price will be slightly better than the average price over the time period. Statistically DCA is a better strategy than a one time all-in.

Hash power is not the only factor the market uses to determine price. Furthermore, as Bcash proved, hash power is transient and self-serving. So that makes it even less of a factor in determining value. If the market values a coin, hash power is strongly drawn to it for their own self-interest/profit. The other more influential factors the market uses to determine value is stability, code quality &amp; philosophy, development projects underway and even personal judgements behind the people involved in development, mining and use.

In the US you need to declare capital gains on any taxable event, which is selling for whatever reason (using for purchase of goods, trading for other crypto, converting to USD, etc). Yes, this is awkward. You must declare capital gains when you buy a cup of coffee, which is ridiculous but that's how it is right now. For tax purposed all crypto is based on its USD value at the time of selling regardless of whether USD is involved or not. Buying ETH with BTC doesn't involve USD but it is reported on taxes as the USD value of ETH and BTC at the time of the transaction.
One important thing that many don't realize is the taxation of airdrops such as BCH. That is taxable income the moment you have access to it. So even if you didn't care about it and never touched it, it still needs to be reported as income the moment you had access to it. BCH hit the ground at $277 (I think) so you must report $277 x [Amt of BCH] as income in your 2017 taxes.

Looks like this person violated the  rule of combining crypto and traditional banking. Never, ever, use a business bank account for crypto transactions or a personal account associated with or has transfers to/from a business account.
The bank's position is quite understandable. If a business is involved with crypto trading it is subject to KYC/AML regulations. If a bank sees crypto trading transactions but has no KYC/AML documentation they want nothing to do with you. So keep your personal crypto trading transactions in a personal account 100% isolated from any business account you may have.

A lot of small businesses keep a grey line between what is business and what is personal. That's fine until crypto gets involved along with business KYC/AML regulations associated with it. The US Govt has not clearly defined if you are or are not subject to KYC/AML regulations in that scenario. I believe the situation is that you technically are as per the word of the law, but it is ridiculous (but don't quote me on that).
To keep your business and personal accounts isolated, your business needs to formally pay you a salary. That salary should go into a personal account not linked to your business. That establishes a hard division between the two. Again, its ridiculous on the scale of a small business but to guarantee your business isn't subject to KYC/AML regulations that's what they want to see.

The problem is how KYC/AML regulations are written. If Tim is managing *any* crypto related to his business account he is technically subject to KYC/AML regs. While it might not even be worth the paper to prosecute him, BofA would be facilitating it with the business account and they have something to lose. Given the vague writing of the regulations I can understand BofA's very conservative approach which is deciding that his business isn't worth the risk.

Red or black doesn't matter with spend &amp; replace. If you spent it at a loss you replenish it at an equally low buy-in. You always break even. The only challenge with that is taxes. The way the IRS wants you to report it is a PIA when you use it like currency. Be sure to learn all about cryptocurrency taxation if you haven't already.

Nope, getting a green card makes you a citizen and subject to the same rules.

Any normal person would think that way but the IRS aren't normal people and unfortunately it's what the IRS thinks that matters.
The real kicker, if you move out of the US you still owe the IRS taxes. You have to move out of the US, renounce your US Citizenship and gain citizenship in another country. Only then you're free.
