Got it, but I'm looking for the hard way to understand better.
@_date: 2014-11-26 12:02:25
I tested it on my nexus 4 and does not work so well.

I haven't spent money on this tattoo. And why remove?

I let a friend do it. I'll have a professional to finish it.
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:09:14
This is my first tattoo.

Philip is the platform administrator.
I asked him to regularize the status of the loan.
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:34:59
We also did not know the delay of the loan and did not want to cause a bad impression.

I know about a raw transaction.
The values that mean "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0", "m/44'/0'/0'/0/1"?
I can simply derive addresses from an timestamp?
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:33:38
The system runs only in your browser.
@_date: 2015-11-17 12:34:13
I think I understand. then I generate one privkey hd and I can take a dump the prvkey of a derivative address?
@_date: 2015-11-17 12:27:39
To sign a tx I would use the master private key in the common format it?
