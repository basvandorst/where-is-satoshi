it seems 2014-2015 scenario repeating again, if this happen we should not expect any major move before 2020-2021
@_date: 2018-10-30 14:48:15
I didnt say strategy i say it looks like it, i know anything can happen and may never like before, 
So what is your call?

what is this movie name ?
is it star war movie? what is it exactly

i saw that video, everything looks like the previous patterns which bitcoin made before, i hope things change faster,
but past performance is not guaranteed to happen every time, that 2014 drop is mainly because of mt,gox issue, and it was fundamentals move, so we dont know what lies on future about sec and other major news which can affect markets, but overall most news in favor of bitcoin i think,
anything can happen, it can start its bull trend sooner than that video, or maybe worse that he predicted can even happen,
but bull trend will happen someday, but price still in cool down before it take off again, and only god knows when that start,
only if price show many green candle on daily and weekly basis without big crash. but it can trick people by showing fake patterns also.

yeah, at least they helped whoever want to enter this market for the next big ride.
i also dont forgive them, they cause big loss to me as well,
i hope they dream crashed and they reverse this stupid idea ever created such forks again.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:08:35
below 5k??? it is already below 5k, it is touched 4k too,
maybe you confused 4k with 5k
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:45:58
ppl investing for profit, look at its history, it raised from cents to 19000$
it can raise to 100k or even more,
this is may not good if you are looking for stable one and paying goods, if you are looking for that use paypal, and many other payment system like western union perfect money and so on.
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:26:03
People is free to hold or sell, but they would not out at loss most probably, they have open mind and will not react with our comments, see if anyone in 2014 in loss if they have exited how huge they lost few month later, things can happen again or maybe not, anyone enter this era knows the risk, things can change, this is tough call indeed I agree
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:08:58
200 MA show higher than 3k for strong support, but anything can happen, need to close much higher for upside indication,
this is crypto, strange things can happen, looking back it can move more than 2k a day.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:45:59
good, sell you coins and move away, u r no true believer, it was up from few $ to this point, it doesnt suppose to move always up. it should go down too, and up again and down again, this is market behavior
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:33:10
only those who keep from 2$ is dead people, or who lost their private keys or send to to unknown not used address,
impossible if someone hold from 2$ for 10000X gain,
i just prey it go up so i take a little lower stressed, or i might get fuck out of here, how can i wait such a long time, 
can anyone really hold this much, what is their dream if this true? in one point they should take profit, after being on 20k around no exit so they must here for 100k
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:07:48
i see your point,
maybe you lucky this prediction, but no one know what exactly can happen, it can shoot up hard in few weeks back over 6-7k, nobody knows, and either it can go lower.
but history of this coin shows that overall it go up. waiting for 2-3k for entry maybe a missing, because it may never see those price.
nobody knows the top and nor the bottom, you have your call, good luck with it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:58:53
for daily it need at least close above 5k, any higher is better
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:58:07
So the price made another bottom today, that's 2 bottom, this one is around 4k, but price still near it. maybe it is break and make another bottom again.
price can shoot to 5k again great timing for buy on 4k area.
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:54:48
There is no past or future, price of this, is poised to go up, and it is inevitable, because new people always buy it and keep buying and supply can't connect with demand and thus increase price ...
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:08:16
humans which dont dump when it was over 15k and now it is 4.5 want to dump?
how stupidity is this,
why they hold it for about 15-20k they would definitely holding for more.
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:43:36
it may opposite can happen, maybe next year or month this 4k will be dream price entry when you see btc is over 10k, and 4k will put to history, like 1k is now a history in 2016
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:30:47
closed bank account? then how would you bail out when you want in fiat to pay for your daily usage and family need ? if you dont have bank account?
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:56:33
lol!, you replied yourself
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:25:53
He is FUD all over his posts, what's the point? We all know we are in big and long bear situation, but reversal won't call us whenever it want to happen and price will not care about anyone, it will do as it should do, we may hit 2-3k or we may  hit 50k in few month, or maybe consolidate for many months,  we just have to be always ready and in the market for possible ride. But one thing to learn from bitcoin past, the long term goal is up and up, sooner or later it's price will reach to those experts predicted price. It's just matter of time and delivery 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:29:32
looking bottom to me as well
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:29:16
bitcoin will every time rise again after a big crash and break its previous high every time it attempt it,
looking back 3 times it happened already,
i think because when it start a real bull trend people all wanting a new high price(new "ATH" utopia) so they keep speculating and buying and push it to go further high(fomo), and institution investors come to aid to push it even higher and then in some point they want to take their profit and that's another ATH again and here we go all the way down again, this cycle may repeat again on next bull run, so we should expect a price higher than its last ALH, maybe around 30-100k, nobody knows when the exact reversal will happen so better to exit before its not too late, but i think bitcoin will be a trillion dollar capital, and it is inevitable
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:02:10
if it is the bottom, and if it is confirmed new bull run, expect huge bull run last 2020-2021
maybe we hit 50-100k next time
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:08:03
daily MA is hovering around 7k, if we fast speed reach and closed above there that would be great.
i hope today we close above 5k
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:51:44
 [xelephonte]( , on your previous posts you said, yes bitcoin can return to 6k again in 3month, and now you change it.
this is quote from you other post, i highlight it.
""  [xelephonte]( points · [3 days ago](
All  the BTC enthusiasts who trash altcoins every day referring to them as  shitcoins, how is Bitcoin any better? It’s had 7 days of shitcoin-like  crashing, dropping in the double digits percentage-wise. Many of you  never imagined Bitcoin could fall below $6K and there surely was great  support at the level...by whom? You couldn’t say...there was just some  imaginary support the whales mislead you in believing. I said many times  that Bitcoin would fall below $5K by the end of the year into the  beginning of 2019. Many labeled me as a paranoid FUD pot-stirrer. No I  just read historical trends and understand support at nearly 10x the  start of the last bull run (when BTC was $600) can’t be held forever.  Today, Bitcoin is performing exactly like every shitcoin and that’s why  so many of you are in shock. I don’t care much for altcoins but unlike  many of you, I don’t worship Bitcoin especially BCashBeTrash, he’s the  biggest culprit. And any of you who would not sell at $6K but are now  selling at $4.8K are delusional beyond repair. Sure, the pain hurts but  at least hold until ***BTC returns to $6K which it will most certainly will  in the next 3 months***...or institute a stop-buy plan where you can rebuy  BTC at a safe price.  Buying high and selling low is exactly how you go  broke. You might have lost value in your BTC but you don’t lose money  until you sell your coins...    """"

Then why it is so many years is growing? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:17:32
after losing 3 days straight, earning mere 3-5% is green!
need few daily green candle here, the bigger green candle is better, in December maybe crazy thing can happen, everyone should load up with btc or altcoin and ready for big jump for December and jan, but not sure if this happen this year, tbh it is hard to predict. but it came from nowhere, judging from bear trend it is very unlikely,
things like that may only happen at the very end of bull market to close it up bull trend once and all for that run.
so this big 3 days fall maybe is the end of down trend and price is gearing up to start new bull trend most probably,
it will fail if it go down and close below 4k now.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:55:07
the party will restart again, but when that's the question. this just need to find the real bottom first, hopefully it may already set that. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:21:38
yeah, he buy at 600$, well of course he should be proud now, because price tank so high through many month after.
but lets see if he bought it at over 10k and can tweet like that again. unless he has such huge faith for price growth, which he seems already passed that trials,
price growth is depend on people believe and they sentiment to buy this currency. and the economy situation of certain currency. including company health and more ..
i think we need some time before this build up,
the worse scenario is for most altcoin including ethereum, they have started their bearish move long before this late BTC  big drop,
and you know what, if this btc drop is on very early btc bear move, consider most altcoin bleed to death,
unless ethereum save them by tanking against btc which is highly unlikely when btc is down trend.
i myself bought one altcoin few month ago and are in big loss, but i have faith on the project, things can change nobody knows, just holding and hope trend reversal happen and those super high prediction of btc id comes out real, may save me.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:45:40
remember, before a long term upside trend, price need to crash and lower, then it find its bottom, and will rise from there, this maybe it, but we still not sure if we find the bottom, but still valid, if we close above 5k, it may do the job, if it stay daily upside, for some days,
we are closing to December, crazy things may happen
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:11:44
i bet most people here and other threads spreading FUD, they want price lower so they can buy at better price.
they are fooling people by selling, and then they buy at lower price,
true holder will not sell until multiply their investments,
we all know this is still continue bear market, but price would grow from some point someday,
maybe yesterday was the lowest price, and maybe we have way to go. this is all speculations.
@_date: 2018-11-04 07:03:25
it seems market is more bullish today
this is the effect of BCH rise most probably
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:17:26
i see, i understand what he meant now, thanks
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:43:46
That will only happen if bitcoin start its uptrend from 2020-2021 for upside move to reach 100k at the end of 2022
at least there is no sign of that for now,
for 2018 i think we wont have any price increase and maybe even drop, look at 2013 spike and then 2014 drop,
well, things can change, we may see 20k by end of 2018, i hope.
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:51:00
So you say market will never recover and you think price never reach 20k or more? In 2014 people also saying that this time is different, time and price will do its job despite we like it or not
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:17:13
Mod asked to report like him, open acc today to troll here, someone report him.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:01:45
this can not be true, it is impossible, it cant go as low as 1k
because there are massive demand for btc on lower price, so many big buyers will hunt it if price go lower,
and supply is limited, and it is very well known crypto all over the world, everyone wants it,
if price hit those level, i would buy them all in one click.
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:51:50
thank you
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:34:14
40% in loss?? well i am about 80% in loss in one altcoin,
bitcoin is strong and can reverse quickly, just hold it,
we have bakkt and long running bear market may comes to an end soon, 
stay hold, and have faith, next bull run if happen, it will probably run through all previous highs.
@_date: 2018-11-03 11:23:20
Do we have SEC "ETF" announcement on November 5? maybe market waiting for that
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:49:18
2025 is too far but realistic, draper forecast 250k by 2021 i think,
i think bitcoin will need to find a bottom and continue growing again. 2-3k bottom is more likely.
you said in 3 month bitcoin will reverse to 6k, if that go there that might a trend reversal, isnt it?
it is very likely bitcoin go beyond of 6k because of bakkt and other good news coming out in 2019
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:27:19
i think [
no need for id verfication
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:37:23
you said your life and now you say at the moment! of course at the moment it might not hold 4k,
but that your life is for long long term perspective, and of course it can see such 25k  price in the future,
nobody expect bitcoin will be 20k back in 2013-2015, but now everyone wont be surprised if btc see huge price,
so i think this time we might see a huge price which can put everyone in shock. but who knows maybe no price increase to high level after that phenomenal move, or take very long time, time will tell ...
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:03:58
thanks, 
This time we dont have a bubble to burst, and we are on lower price,
what effect this time will have then, maybe no effect at all.
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:03:40
your life time only 25k??
if this breach 20k mark, then a new zone can be over 5-10X of last high. so 25k is really low
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:29:59
why you think it is deluded ?
it was only about 1$ then it go to 1k in 2013 , it was deluded on 2012? but it happened
it was about 700$ on 2016 and it go to about 20k next year, it was deluded on 2016 or early 2017 but that happened???
now it is 3.5k, it has possibility to go to an unknown zone which is certainty well above 20k, of course it may not happen this time or may happen far beyond of what we can imagine.
so think positive, cycle may repeat again, and once it does, we should be on train and not just stare it and regret it.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:48:08
everyone knows if holding for long time, it will eventually turn in favor,
but holding is really hard, while uncertain about future,
but checking with past performance give some confidence,
and also bitcoin and other crypto gaining adoption every month, country and shops will accept bitcoin and its daily usage and transaction increasing,
i think this time we might get even faster time period for getting another moon. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:15:52
Thanks, good posts , it is true most of the time, so much confidence,
will see if it arise again like it did before, but i personally think this time look bad 
i fear it may go about 1-2k and stay there for months or years.
i just wonder why it is going down while it is so much famous and everyone buying it and hold it. after about 10 years it value should be over 10k no bubble.
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:44:58


why is that important ?
why cant wait ? does it have any effect on crypto market??
