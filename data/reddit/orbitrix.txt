I sympathize if you lost any money from this, and I admit I'm a little out of the loops but:
Is the verdict really that he was intentionally negligent? I still kind of have the impression that he was just someone who was in the right place at the right time to ride the wave of bitcoin, and just got in over his head and expertise....  Sure, he could have recognized this and maybe hired/handed off the business to people who knew what they were doing, but is there really some justification to out-right vilify him?
I've personally been in this position:  When suprnova.org (the first major BitTorrent sharing websites) went down for the first time, one of my websites was linked to from the front page as an alternative.  Admittedly I got in over my head w/ all the attention/traffic.  I had newspapers contacting me wanting interviews... i was just some 17 year old kid at the time...  So I could see how something like that could happen to someone, and how easily it could get out of control.  You have to admit bitcoin exploded wildly past just about everyone's expectations. 
If there is cold hard evidence of negligence, by all means link me to the details, because as I said: I'm out of the loop. But otherwise, I don't think its all that fair for you to turn your financial risks and angst into negative vibes towards this person. 
If you're saying these things because you lost money, it was just as much your responsibility to do research about the origins of mtgox, and who was running it.  And I don't think there was any misconception that it used to be a Magic the Gathering Online trading card exchange.  If you were willing to give those sorts of people tons of your money, that's nobody's fault but yours.

Not to mention the fact that the Silk Road is way more difficult to use than finding drugs on the streets...   So its very tenuous at best to argue the Silk Road somehow made it easier for them to get ahold of the drugs that killed them.   They had to be VERY determined to learn TOR, learn bitcoin, acquire bitcoin, learn the Silk Road's escrow system and rules, spend the bitcoin, learn encryption software like PGP to encrypt their Address etc etc etc. 
These individuals were going to get drugs one way or another with that level of determination, because of some desire inside of them that has nothing todo with the Silk Road or drugs themselves.   Its just human nature and personal circumstance.   They have no one to blame but themselves for their deaths, or maybe their parents and childhood a little bit...

I don't think he could have ever guessed how big this would get.  It was out of control before he knew what hit him.  I hope he wins all appeals.  
This is only going to steel other's resolve in marching forward with Dark Net Markets, it won't deter anyone.  Why do the powers that be have to keep learning this lesson the hard way?  People are going to do drugs.  Too bad so sad, deal with it.  They're not going to go away.  You can't stop them.  You cut the head off one Market, 10 more appear in its place.  The underground drug market scene is even bigger than it was at the height of the Silk Road.  This is the way things are now and its not going to change no matter what happens to Ross.  So why throw his life away?  Why waste all this money on jailing him?  It makes no sense, and changes nothing.

You'd be surprised how ignorant people 45 years old and above still are about drugs...  You have to consider what they were taught growing up as children, and it sorta makes sense.    Drugs = the Devil, etc.    
There is no doubt a huge lobby within the DEA, and the private prison industry, that does whatever it takes to keep the laws the way they are.   But there is still a long ways to go with educating the average citizen too.  Society at large still would not vote to legalize or decriminalize anything but maybe marijuana.  Its progress, but a good couple of generations still need to die off before we see real change when it comes to anything else.

I'm not knocking bitcoins even a little bit, infact i'd say I'm more eloquently defending bitcoin than anyone else in this thread if you read my other posts.  I'm just just stating (the current) facts.
Thats why I say "for *better*, or worse".  It can go either way.  My statement about divisibility is neutral.
Making changes to the divisibility certainly isnt insurmountable.  But it will become necisary some day.  And that will have effects... (these effects might be good, these effects might be bad...  the effects might be purely psychological and not technical.... the point is, these effects will exist)
Thats literally all i've implied.  I supose I was wrong in assuming everyone in here was well aware the protocol can be updated.  That was implied in my post, even tho it wasnt said.
 I just try to keep everyone's idealistic views of bitcoin in check w/ the facts.  Sure, the protocol can be updated, but right now bitcoins are divisible by 8 decimial places, and to say otherwise is misleading, idealistic, and not something we've proven to be technologically **successful** yet even if it is technologically **feasible**
I like to talk about how bitcoin is currently, not how "it might be some day" when trying to sell people on it.  So i correct people as such. 
 In fact talking about how the "protocol might be someday" by means of intervention of the protocol sounds an awful lot like "regulation" that bitcoin tries to distance itself from in the real world financial system.  Obviously increasing divisibility isnt too crazy, but then whats next?  And who decides how far that divisibility goes? why NOT make it infinite and be done with it?
The fact that anyone might be fiddling w/ the protocol in the future could be seen as a major knock against bitcoins to certain people.  Even though I think thats silly.
@_date: 2012-09-06 18:29:43
I dont like this argument against bitcoin "not being real money", because its simply not the use-case bitcoin was designed for in my opinion.  Anyone expecting bitcoin to reach the "buying milk at the grocery store" milestone I think is a little misguided about exactly what the utility of bitcoin is.  It might get there someday, but if it doesnt I wont be the slightest bit surprised. 
You generally dont need to be anonymous to buy a six-pack of beer at the store, so the utility of bitcoin has no value in that type of transaction.  Especially considering how long it takes a transaction to go through.  But this is a necessary evil of how secure the bitcoin network is, which is its main utility.
I just dont see BitCoin as a currency thats going to "Take over" but its also something that isnt going to go away.   It absolutely has value and will continue to be useful in certain situations.  It doesn't need to replace regular money and day to day transactions to still be immensely successful and useful. 
I got caught up in the hype too, and really wanted bitcoins to replace all currency and be "the next big thing".  But over time I've become comfortable with it occupying its niche.  
Bitcoin is a very real and very effective currency, its just never going to be everything everyone inherently expects it to be when they hear the word "currency".  Its a new beast entirely, not really analogous to what you traditionally know.  But its still very much real money.  Its just a special type of money you use in special situations.

But you said:


If all the wallets are fake, then wtf, whats the point?
Are you saying the real wallet is hidden somewhere else completely?
If so why even have fake wallets in the first place? especially multiple ones for that matter?  If you're going as far as to have your wallet in a non-standard location, you probably aren't letting it slip you have many bitcoins... not sure where this is going.
Making up garbage data that looks like an encrypted file definitely isn't hard at all, so you could have a bunch of fake wallets among your legit one I suppose... but that really doesnt save you from the person taking all of them.  And if the real wallet isnt there, you might as well not even have any decoy wallets so they think they have the wrong computer altogether.

The quantities people typically buy over SR aren't worth any law enforcement's time.   They want to bust the admins or possibly some of the sellers.   Thats all that matters.   Trying to bust Silk Road customers is like trying to stop people from downloading MP3s.   Just not gana happen.  You could make a few examples but it wont stop anything and Tor/I2P certainly arent perfect, but they immediately make the budget to bust you for any law enforcement agency not worth it.   
And if the sellers arent stupid and follow all the rules, it really is quite difficult to pin anyone down enough to have it hold up in court.
Everyone always freaks out when SR goes down, but I dont think its any reason to trust them less than anyones ever trusted them.  They are working on their own codebase and have a lot of demand.  Even reddit goes down for an afternoon every now and then, I'm sure the silkroad doesnt have quite as many technical resources at the time being, as part of being discrete.
there's always risk involved in illicit activity, but SR is a truly facinating and revolutionary service.  Love it or hate it, its helping to forge a new economy that might just save the world some day, so its interesting to follow if nothing else.
Just like the relatively unimportant game and  porn industry lead a lot of technological advances that eventually permeate all of society, so it is with drugs and the economy.

Buying milk at the grocery store isn't the problem bitcoin is trying to solve.  Allowing the opressed people of foreign governments a way to buy goods anonymously is what bitcoin was designed for.  Allowing the War on Drugs to collapse because there is absolutely nothing they can do to track the trade of bitcoins for drugs, is what bitcoin was designed for.  Allowing sick people to buy medicine in confidence, without scrutiny, and without an embarrassing paper trail for an embarrassing condition is what bitcoin was designed for.   It will have its place, I just dont think it'll be where you think it will... you are overstating its purpose.  It will be used where safety and anonymity are paramount.   You dont need to be anonymous to buy milk at a grocery store.  Its not going to be a currency that completely "takes over".  But it will always have its place for those who need its very particular services.  Trying to make it "quick to buy something at a store like a credit card" would surely be couter productive and eliminate some of its key features.
**edit:** Also, dont forget (as many do), you can pay a "Transaction Fee" when sending bitcoins, that will allow your transaction to be processed faster by the whole system... so if you think its taking too long for your transaction to "settle" (get confirmations) pay a higher transaction fee next time (in your bitcoin client settings)

I see nothing about transaction fee's only effecting your first confirmation anywhere in the official wiki.  I'm going to need a citation on that.


my emphasis.
And sure, it still may not be as good as instant credit card purchases.. but thats what we have credit cards for.  It is not the problem bitcoin set out to solve, in fact the increased transaction time is a byproduct of the problems bitcoin DOES solve.  (which are much more noble and grand than speeding up the purchase of a soda pop from a convenience store.  We really dont need bitcoin accepted on that level.  Thats not what its designed for.)

I agree with Major, i see BitCoin and TOR as this generation's chance to FINALLY end the failed and currupt war on drugs.  Finally a system that the powers that be cant counter, or take down... they will have to change the laws to treat drugs abusers like what they are:  sick people in need of treatment and help, not jail and punishment.  A truly positive thing.
@_date: 2011-06-09 19:53:59
Oh and also.. u can pay a fee ("recommended: 0.01" by the offical client) to expedite how fast your transaction is confirmed.  So if its really an issue for you, there is already a solution.

its important for the client to be as neutral as possible, because whoever controls the protocol and main client, is the closest thing there can be to a "central authority" in the whole scheme of things.  They can influence a lot of things unwittingly.  I get passionate about it because people misinterpret the elegance of how it already works for a "learning curve" or "shortcoming" that i just don't think is really there.  Either that or it will simply be necessary for such a quantum shift in population's concept of economics
Like i mentioned to jdkeith, Mint.com is great example of something BUILT AROUND how your bank/credit card/loans already work, to make your life easier and simple, while leaving your checking account at your bank, simple, clean, and basic. 
I like the idea of more choice and competition for making bitcoins easier for more people to use.  Not a central person designing 1 master client that everyone uses.  It must be super stable and secure, never changing much.  If you start adding user experience enhancement to it, it will become bloated, need maintenance, need legacy support. It really only needs to sit in your system tray and backup your wallet file somewhere anyways.   maybe change the "# of confirmations" to "Your money has cleared :)!"   and alias the hashes to 'pretty' names... but beyond that, meh.

I'll re-emphasize what i replied to you in the past with:  Its not the bitcoin client itself that needs fiddling with.  Some 3rd party, like Google... or a Bank... needs to come along and provide web-management services, and a way to spend bitcoins that is more traditional.  If you look at how some of the BitCoin Pool mining websites work (like  ), this is an early example of what someone like google could come along and provide for people to manage their bitcoins online.   BitCoin itself shouldnt be changed much though.  Most of the problems you mention can be solved by building solutions around how BitCoin already works.  I think the bitcoin client itself needs to be as lean, mean, and simple as possible to stay stable and secure.  All the ways in which it works have been carefully thought-out, even if they seem counter-intuitive to a new user.   I definitely agree these changes need to happen some how though.  Just not to the BitCoin client please.  If someone makes a web management interface properly, after you install the bitcoin client you wont even need to look at it, or know how it works.

the whole point of the hashes is for anonymity, the last thing you want in a system like this is usernames.  What if your checking account number was your first and last name? And if you're going to bother with the Salt at all, might as well just be using the Hash.  There is no reason to believe they would ever run out either, just because you generated a new address, doesn't mean your old one just goes away forever and becomes unusable.  The way the master ledger, and wallet files work: someone else can use an old address of yours when you are no longer using it.  MtGox lets you exchange coins USD-&gt;BTC and BTC-&gt;USD.  And really, the client UI couldn't be more simple.. its a ledger... and a total... everyone knows how that works if they've ever balanced a check book.   Its all very elegant if you ask me.  Maybe not for non geeks yet, but still technically sound.
@_date: 2011-06-09 23:14:53
So let me get this straight.... Replace your Bitcoin address with a checking account number.... and this thing is literally as simple as looking a checkbook ballance... but somehow people are having trouble conceptualizing a Ledger and Ballance? Thats seriously too confusing for people?  This baffles me... The client is PERFECT.... flawless in its elegance... all of its shortcomings most certainly by design.  SkunkRecords is correct in that its 3rd party industries that need to rally around the existing system, and build solutions around how it already works.  Because it works the way it does for VERY specific reasons.  These can be made more user friendly through web management services, and perhaps a bitcoin debit card.  I think for the sake of stability and security, the client should remain simple, bare bones... a simple ledger and ballance... with a send button... doesnt get any more retarded easy then that.  So easy, anyone who's used a checkbook in the last 100 years can understand it.  
@_date: 2011-06-09 19:45:58
Buying stuff from a local shop simply isnt the problem bitcoin is trying to solve.  People need to get off this "bitcoin as a complete replacement currency" trip, and realize it will fill its nitch for the problems it was designed to solve.  (anonymity, decentralized control, black markets, etc)  the wait is well worth the benefit it provides to the people who really need it.   BitCoin is going to be economic liberty for the oppressed people of foreign governments..... not to make buying a soda at the gas station easier.
@_date: 2011-07-07 23:48:12
But I send bitcoins all the time without a fee.... why would i ever pay it?  1 Confirmation doesn't confirm anything (according to most people here.. altho i'd beg to differ), so why would i ever pay a fee to obtain one quicker, when what i really want is at least 8 confirmations as quick as possible?  There's so much i'm missing here.  Can someone please post a citation from somewhere legitimate, like the official wiki?  The way I understand what you're saying is you HAVE to pay a fee no matter what to get ur first confirmation, but that it is also pointless to pay a fee cause it only effects first confirmation.. which "means nothing"... *brain explodes*...  
Oh well, my main point is that it doesnt matter...  Bitcoin isnt made for quick transactions.  Slow transactions are a WELCOME byproduct of the problems bitcoin DOES solve.
@_date: 2011-06-09 19:43:08
I have never had it take more than 10 minutes for something to confirm at least 8 times... maybe 30 minutes at the most.... I really don't see why everyone has their panties in a bunch over this.   Transferring funds between banks can take time to clear as well.  Big whoop.  Its a very small price to pay for the level of security and anonymity the system can provide.  Compromises people.  Isnt it that super fast micro-trading they do wallstreet that causes all sorts of problems anyways?
@_date: 2011-06-11 19:47:13
Sort of, Silk Road did(does..) actually have an Escrow service.  You're not just sending your coins off into the dark and hoping for the best.  They verify the transaction is completed properly before releasing the bitcoin funds to the seller.  If you get fucked, you have a chance of getting all or at least half of your money back.  There's also a feedback system just like ebay... its all pretty legit.  Which is why I think it scared congress so much.
@_date: 2011-06-07 19:22:59
Allowing people to buy bitcoins however they'd like with credit cards would devalue the currency and be bad at the start of things.  Forcing people to use dwolla encourages people to exchange hard cash for bitcoins, not borrowed cash, which in turn makes bitcoin stronger, because its backed by "Real" assets.   It ensures bitcoin is more than a bubble waiting to burst.  
Dwolla's sign up process isnt any more complicated then verifying a Paypal account, and that is wildly popular.
I suppose minor wording in the client could be changed to clear some things up for people, But any more complexity would surely be a bad thing.  A simple ledger and balance is all it ever needs to be.   I think most of the "ease of use" stuff will come in the form of 3rd party industries supporting BitCoin with web-management tools, and real life ways to spend bitcoin, none of which needs to be handled by the client itself.  (it can all be built around how it already works)  
I'm seriously baffled by people saying the "bitcoins interface was clearly made by developers" or that its "too confusing" or "not complex enough".  I seriously feel like everyone on reddit is too young to ever have balanced a checkbook.... thats exactly what bitcoin is molded after, and it couldnt be any simpler and non-confusing (except for maybing waiting for "confirmations") ... but if you've ever waited for money to "clear" transferring it between checking accounts at the bank, its the same thing.  Bitcoin is a new currency that works in a very different way.... there will always be a learning curve.  
What would be best is if Bank of American (or someone) came along and offered a BitCoin debit card u could associate your hash address with, etc.  To make things easier to use.... but you dont need to change how bitcoin looks/works at all for that to happen.
I dont think it has quite as many issues as poeple say, most of the inconveniences are explained away as necessary evils for the solid technologically sound nature of the system.  Any major changes to bitcoin threaten its security and stability.  3rd party cottage industries will need to pop up to fill the "ease of use" void.

IDK what Utopian education system you grew up with, but those were not the types of skills bestowed upon me in in the United States public education system.
If there needs to be a unit about playing well with others so be it, but it doesn't need to be some subversive secondary tacked on aspect that the system just 'hopes' to get through to you via stress and hoop jumping.  But if you feel you need that, then I guess it all works out ok for your style of "learning" (read: conditioning). 
But where I come from, we call that learning how to not think for yourself.  Face it.  Acting like what we teach our kids is somehow an intentional learning exercise to teach them to 'play well with others' is a really sad cop-out for how shitty our system is.  They can learn that in 2 years of kindergarten if taught properly.  The rest does nothing more than condition them to suck on that capitalist tit, and fit into the crooked corporate hierarchy, with no complaints. 
I'd really much rather our education system be based on intentional hands on learning, not forced conditioning.

**DO NOT USE CRYPTOCAT**
if you dont know why, then you need to do a LOT research about cryptography and secure systems in general.
Don't give yourself a false sense of security with nonsense like this. 
I hate to be such a dick about it, but it makes me sick to my stomach that THIS, of ALL THINGS is whats getting posted around in light of the NSA scandal.  **It is NOT "better than nothing".  Its worse.**  A false sense of security is way worse than no security at all. 
The fact that it needs a cute cat marketing scheme should tell you their first concern isn't security. Not to mention Browsers and browser plugins are inherently unsecured for a whole slue of reasons.  There's way better proven and tested software that has been around for ages for protecting yourself. 
Cryptography generally SHOULDN'T EVER BE EASY.  It's supposed to be challenging to understand.  You're supposed to have to do your research.  You're supposed to have to know how to set it up yourself.   The second you rely on anyone else to manage it for you, you lose.  Using crypocat, you are relying on way too many 3rd party factors. 
Security is not going to come in the form of some cute website w/ a cat, and its beyond twisted to me that they market their service in such a way.  There's nothing 'cute' about protecting yourself from the government.

As long as browsers and browser plugins auto-update over the internet, this will always be true.

The top comment says
"I think the fact that Bitcoin's value was impacted by the Silk Road takedown is a mark of how volatile this currency is" ...
How was the value of bitcoin impacted by SR's take down?  It berly faltered at all... And i've only seen the value go up up and away.... 
The value has been $10-$15 higher than it was pre-take down.  He seems to be imply it was impacted negatively though... hmm.

They wouldn't even need to 'want' to harm bitcoin.  Just the fact that they would have control and the ability to is inherently a bad thing for many many many reasons. 
It would make them a target.  A central failure point.  If they ever got hacked, etc.... bad news bears.

I'm out of the loop. Is that what KnC Mining is using?   At least there are some rules and guidelines to kickstarter, and you buy into it with the knowledge nothing may be delivered in the end because its mostly amatures.
When you pre-order from a business, you should be able to expect accountability to the extreme.  But as history has shown, that hasn't been the case with BitCoin mining equipment. 
Random companies offering pre-orders for bitcoin mining machines is for people who like no lube when they get fucked.  How many times do we have to go through this as a community before someone can offer up decent bitcoin hardware up front?

What does it matter though?  Those were the rules, and school isn't about learning or doing cool shit.  It's about jumping through hoops and proving you can be subordinate.  
This is a huge reason why the economy is so fucked now.   Traditional Institutionalized Education has very little bearing on intelligence, or one's own will to educate ones self.   It's all about control, conformance and subordination. 
 So all the smart people are un-credentialed because they wont put up with bullshit like this.  While all the stupid sheep who can jump through arbitrary hoops like this have degree's and control.

Thats not the point.  Its not about what BTC Guild "wants".  Its not about how they behave, or whether or not its good or bad.   
You have to take the human/corporate aspects out of it and look at the problem from a purely technical standpoint.
If they control the network, they become a target.   They become a central failing point, with a giant bullseye on their forehead.   They wouldnt even need to fuck anything up themselves for this to be a bad thing.  
It should be every bitcoin supporters mission to NEVER let the network be majority controlled by anyone.  Bitcoin's distributed nature is the very fundamental foundation that this technology thrives on.   
Also, if they gained control, people's faith in the security of bitcoin would inherently fall through the floor, causing the valuation to do the same thing.  This is bad for bitcoin even if BTC Guild are saintly super-humans who are physically incapable from being evil.

With all the venture capitalists in silicon valley, and all the startups that are based on shittier ideas than bitcoin, I dont understand this phenomenon.  It seems like there should be plenty of people willing to invest in this on the backend, instead of relying on their customer's preorders.  Even if they lost all their money investing it, the same shit happens every day with hundreds of startups that are based on the most retarded shit ever. 
Any investment in bitcoin comes with the built in passion of a pre-existing audience.  People are are over the top passionate about its success.    It seems like the least risky thing ever, when you consider some of the stuff that gets funding from tech sector venture capitalists.   I guess I don't understand the convoluted process of sourcing hardware fabrication though.  It must be a real son of a bitch, because I dont see why someone like the Winklevoss twins haven't just come along and invested in that sort of thing without relying on crowd sourced funding.

I'd be on the same page as you if pre-orders scams weren't already a huge epidemic in the community.
I dont know how you make the leap from "Preorders" to "siting on a shelf just waiting for you to buy"
I have no doubt theres lots of demand for these magical money making machines and I'd never expect them to just sit on a shelf being available.  But I still don't understand why these companys need to do a "pre-order" business model?  Every single last one of these has been a scam so far... Companys shouldn't offer pre-orders on such things for a lot of obvious reasons.  Preorders just allow a different set of people to corner the market on these things, if they even ever turn up.
 If i were one of these company's I'd sure as hell scam people for their pre-order money while I mined w/ their hardware.  The incentive to do that is simply too high for anyone to resist.  That's why it keeps happening.
Put them up for sale like concert tickets.  Sure they'll sell out instantly and tons of people will be screwed.  Or offer 'reservations' where no money changes hand until the unit is ready to ship.   But Pre-orders?  Anyone who pre-orders mining hardware deserves whatever they get. Which is historically nothing, or too little too late.

"Supply and Demand" is all fine n' dandy until people take advantage of that Demand to scam.  "Supply and Demand" only works when there is legitimate accountability.  I guess demands so high and people are so desperate, being scammed is just part of the game now?  Great community we're building here /s.  I guess this is just another case of desperate individuals with more money than sense.
