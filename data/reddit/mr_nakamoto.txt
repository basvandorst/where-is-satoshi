What are the fees?

They can short all they want, can't prevent the future!

No it is not. They both use peer\-to\-peer network, to be decentralized, but the main thing about blockchain is that it uses blocks to store information. Those blocks cannot be replaced, and one cannot cheat when using a legit blockchain. It can be used to pretty much anything from voting to food traceability without the need of a supervising authority.

That's actually pretty clever of the hackers

That's actually nice of Vitalik to prove them wrong.

Give them discount for using it and they will. After all it still would be cheaper for the business than e.g. PayPal.

Hell no. They have nothing to show for their project and the whole concept is not even blockchain-based. Still, hoping for a little hype and gaining some free money off of it (selling the first moment I'm able to).

Don't you be selling now!

That's awesome news. Raises the awareness of Bitcoin more than you'd guess
@_date: 2019-01-17 11:11:54

@_date: 2018-11-20 11:03:06
My plan is to buy some more. Oh and I feel great.

I'd prefer if they used an actual cryptocurrency instead of a stablecoin, but always nice to see large companies adopting the development.
