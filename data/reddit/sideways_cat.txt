Some guy with a lot of stake in cryptos says it will surge.
Seems legit.

Perfection. Nice OP.

There’s an inverse relationship between the price of Bitcoin and the quality of content on this sub.

But why are the candles green?

So does this have anything to do with actual Wall Street or is this just a guy who got the WallStCheatSheet.com domain blogging from his apartment?

You feds won’t get a bitcoin out of me. ‘Cause I’m a mother f***in’ P-I-M-P.

Thank you for posting this. This is such a great example of how ludicrous hype and FUD really are. They are opposite yet equal evils. 
We need to stop believing every idiot who says “it’s going to reach 100K by 2019!” and equally the idiots that say “bitcoin is dead!” 
I really appreciate this post. It highlights not only the lunacy of these outrageous claims but it also illuminates the fact that NO ONE can predict the future of bitcoin. And anyone that replies with “well so-and-so said bitcoin was going to crash and it did so your full of it”: even a broken clock is right twice a day. They got lucky in their prediction. 
Do not believe 99.9% if not 100% of the crap that is written about bitcoin. 
Buy it, or don’t. 
End of rant.

A rise in bitcoin is exciting. A nearly instantaneous spike in price and I’m suspicious of whale manipulation. Didn’t you listen to the dog? He explained it perfectly.

Just saw this comment/edit and if I could I would guild you. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:22:09
Translation: a man who is overly optimistic about bitcoin really hopes the price will go up soon. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:45:02
Yes. 
Edit: maybe?
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:57:04
Well of course, everyone knows that. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:05:49
Well of course, everyone knows that.

Yeah dude, the sentiment is nice and your heart’s in the right place but most of us are too jaded to deal with your enthusiasm.

Did they change their name to 13 Minutes?
@_date: 2018-12-02 03:29:07
It irrational oh I know. I’m just not fucking selling 
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:24:22
You’re missing the point. 
I’m not fuc...you get the point.

I didn’t invest more than I could lose. Plus I bought very early. Thanks for the FUD though. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:37:46
No. Still at about 100% return on my investment. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:02:00
Yes. That’s the message my post is conveying. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:18:14
No they’re not. I didn’t first buy in January 2018 I bought long before that. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 03:18:10
Hold it
