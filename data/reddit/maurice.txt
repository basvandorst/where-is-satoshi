[MyTrezor.com]( came online in the last 2-3 days. The browser USB plugin for Windows and Linux seems to work, of course I don't have a device to test fully.
Initially they didn't plan their own web wallet (UI, the actual wallet is on device), but I guess the task of getting production level support in most of the wallets (Electrum, Multibit, Armory, Core etc) simultaneously would've taken even much more time.

Useful list of public p2pool nodes
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:42:09
Even just using a public P2Pool node improves P2Pool parameters, making it more attractive. It's definitely better to use one of hundreds available nodes than one of 5-10 big centralized pools.

You are really good. I see you need such precision that anything less than 5.382350742737714831626029583777626186247289297170937061309814453125×10^-9 % error is not good enough for you.
It would require much more than just feeling smart to prove that hashes are NOT evenly distributed.

Isn't it obvious shib(t)es are selectively up and downvoting threads in This is a full blown subreddit war already
EDIT: just look at the votes distribution for this thread. And the title is doge-negative

I think I'll give up using reddit. The first comment to this question was mine. I provided 7.922816251×10^28 as answer - it exactly equals 2^96 as provided by the top comment.
And what do you mean answering 'No'? An address is a RipeMD-160 hash of the public key, not the private one.
I think I need at least an apology.
Oh wait... just keep downvoting.

It shows currently ~ 140 nodes. Most other similar services list at most ~ 60.

you mean public keys?... 7.922816251×10^28 per single address

I am not sure I completely understand the patch, but isn't it better to evict transactions, low-priority first, than allowing someone to cap the mempool at will?

Isn't that even more DOSable?

The idea is that you need accounts when holding multiple different user's balances. The trivial example is an online wallet.
It was decided there's no need for this in the UI.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:48:47
Take current system. Everybody's hashing power stays the same. You change the difficulty scheme to get a block every 2 minutes. The attacker's percentage of total hash rate won't change.
Meni shows that all that matters is number of confirmations and atacker's share of total power. Since that share is the same and the confirmations pass quicker you'd have more security with faster blocks.
Unfortunately there are other reasons for 10 minute blocks. I don't have any proof but think it is related with network's health as a whole.
EDIT: found [some comments by Meni]( on reducing blocks pace' disadvatages

Yes, they are. Most of the small scale miners use basements, warehouses etc. I want to use the rigs as heaters, but need them much quieter and efficient in heating air.

I am not stating humanity WILL HAVE access to more energy.
I state that IF available energy grows, everything 'physical' we currently find scarce will be much more available.
Dollar bills availability is constrained only by the Fed, I don't see what  your argument is here. I am talking about the so called physically scarce resources, which we perceive as such just because it is energetically expensive to transmute elements at this moment. Which may or may not hold in the future.

It means your GPU is most probably overheated (i.e. due to overclocking) and is returning results which fail to verify on the CPU.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:22:28
Yes, I just want to use the heat in my home. But the noise is too much. Ideally, I want a domestic electrical convection heater which produces bitcoins in the process.

'Issuance' in this case is the offer of some private shares to the public. This is one of the most important parts of an IPO agreement - how the price would be determined. In S.DICE's case it was in three fixed price tranches (instead of an auction). All further offerings according to the contract should be priced not lower than the average market price. Otherwise, the private owner may decide to sell i.e. 35% (35 000 000) of the shares at a significantly lower than market price or even lower than the initial IPO price (say 0.0005), thus extracting value from current shareholders.
Also note that according to the contract no other shares than the 100 000 000 can be issued:
"The representatives of SatoshiDice solemnly promise and warrant never to issue more shares on any other venue nor in any way to dilute existing shareholders at any point in the future."

This is a severe breach of the [IPO terms](
"All future share issuance will be made only a) subject to approval by MPEx and b) at a price no less than the higher of the 1 day average price and the 30 day average price then current on MPEx"
