Wait isn't bitcoin all about decentralization and consensus? If a person wants to modify and run a different version of the code and call it bitcoin, they can do that because there is no central authority enforcing names and shit. People point to decentralization when defending core, but get bent when decentralization is used in the same way to call something 'bitcoin'. Some arguments here (as well as on the other side to be fair) are deeply ironic...

if only the big investors in china actually cared... In reality, they don't. BTC is too small and irrelevant for them at this time. 3.5B market is an absolutely minuscule market and risky for any substantial amount of money coming in.
It might matter in the future, just not right now.

Investment? Why... it's meant to be something for utility... 1. buy 2. spend 3. replace. That's utilizing the feature of the network. It's like saying the internet was a "bad investment". It's the same network effect we are talking about. Bitcoin isn't a scheme the same way the internet is not a scheme, its a tool, use at as such... I don't know why people view bitcoin as "stock".

Actually USD itself makes people with saving and pensions suffer. By the time you save money, 20 years from now that money is worth 5 times less. Also not sure how this works: You give a bank 100 dollars, they can actually lend up 1000 dollars from that original 100 to other people. Does that compute? Wonder what would happen if everyone tried withdrawing all their money from banks...
Bitcoin won't replace fiat, the same way e-mail didn't replace post services... the same way the internet didn't replace telephones. It's simply a more convenient and sure way of transacting from one point of the world to another securely, in a matter of seconds and pretty much.. for free. 
Of course for those who prefer USD, no one is forcing them to adopt bitcoin. You can trade in goats still today if your really want to.

Doubt this is 'mind changing', but just my view on it:
In a perfect scenario you would have a currency that cannot be controlled by any government or wealthy group of individuals, whose core principles are based on mathematics and the laws of the universe instead of the 'opinions' of a few select humans. Where transactions can't be reversed merely on "he said she said" and where you can send money where you want, and how much you want without restrictions or supervision.
It's the first of its kind but it's far away from perfect, many problems to solve still. I consider bitcoin as a prototype rather than the actual product of a future currency model.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:17:49
Hmm... Last time I checked it took 48 hours for a credit card bill payment to actually register on my account and 4 days to put a cheque in my bank account...
I'll take the 2 hour wait anyday knowing that after those 2 hours (likely even in 20-40 min) my money is irreversibly mine.
Your choice though.
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:17:27
Every check in the word has the account number right on the check. To access the funds you need the correct signature... Yes prehistoric as fuck, but that's reality. 
So Account number is NOT your private key.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:53:37
Sure. The main argument was that one should stop using bitcoin because it isn't instant. My point is, neither is any other form of payment except for exchanging gold coins.

@_date: 2014-02-11 19:38:04
It could just be as simple as having all the current software monitoring the blockchain after at least a few confirmation for proof of transaction instead of transaction ID. Even with no changes to the bitcoin protocol, it still not really an "issue" if people become informed and don't write bad code.
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:47:09
Thanks! For a moment I thought they changed 'statoshi' to 'bit'.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:51:48
Never said bitcoin is instant. However, after 2 hours of confirmations the odds are astronomically in the favour that the BTC someone sent you is now in your posession.

This holds true even if every satoshi (1 x 100,000,000th of a bitcoin) was spread across 2.1 quadrillion addresses, you still would have so many possible drawers that the chances to collide with any 1 of the 2.1 quadrillion addresses actually containing a satoshi is still near 0. Because math!

Don't think it's that relevant because most of Satoshi's early addresses don't have any signed outputs. 
AFAIK, bitcoin's current vulnerability to a quantum computer is the elliptic curve cryptography part involved in publicly signing a transaction (or message).

He didn't sign the message with the hash string directly, he does some bullshit replacing the BitcoinMessage with his own class which has its own custom GetHash function instead of the one in standard library (ImmutableSerializable.GetHash) to return its own hash rather than the one supported by the library. It's just a trick. If it was legit, it would be signed with a string message using the BitcoinMessage class.

^ This. The high hashing power is a result of the competition for receiving a block reward, NOT a requirement of the network. The higher the value of BTC, the higher the competition, the higher the network security. Scale all those values down and you still have a stable system. In fact, it's exactly how it was in the beginning.
