You are talking about Coinbase implementing not only SegWit but also Lightning Network. As none of the existing implementations of LN are ready for mainnet, it is unreasonable to think that Coinbase will be deploying LN.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:06:47


We can do that now, we don't need to wait for Coinbase to do anything. The benefit of Coinbase adopting SegWit is that it will reduce fees (for a while, until blocks fill up again).
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:56:33
You completely misunderstood the point I was making. Blockchains are extremely expensive, they trade transaction processing throughput for security and decentralization. The world's transactions cannot take place on-chain. Not even a meaningful fraction of it, and still keep the properties of decentralization.

Perhaps you don't realize that I am very proficient in C++ and I have a deep understanding of software, having been writing it for over 35 years now and published quite a bit of it. I can easily tell the quality of a C++ software project just by inspecting the GitHub repository, the commit log, and the depth of conversations which take place in the GitHub issues and pull requests.
I lurk extensively on the bitcoin developers mailing list. Experienced engineers know that mailing list is where the quality is at, simply by looking at the technical level and depth of discourse. I also read the various white papers and proposals. Sure enough, those involved with the bitcoin core project exhibit higher levels of technical excellence and clarity of exposition. 
I'll stop treating Bitcoin Core as good software when I see the signs of decline I am all too familiar with. I see no such signs today. Objectively speaking, Bitcoin Core is the best implementation and has the best community and developers.

Lightning network will allow users to utilize the network that currently cannot, either because the businesses don't exist yet or because the fees are too high. The additional users brought in by lightning network will more than offset any decrease in fees. I do not think fees will go down with LN. Rather, I think they will go up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:15:18
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:26:46
No that is not quite right. Everyone has access to SegWit-capable wallets. You do not need Coinbase to deploy SegWit in order to receive your coins from Coinbase and place them in a SegWit address. Anyone who wants to use lightning can do so today, without any action required on the part of Coinbase, simply by moving some of their coins to a SegWit capable address and then locking up funds in one or more channels.

@_date: 2017-03-20 19:36:11
That's not true. Developers have to make sure they don't introduce changes that would make mining unprofitable, or else the security of the network will decrease. For example, hard forking to an 8MB block size limit would destroy the fee market, miners would see revenues drop by 40% or more.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:32:38

I think that Roger Ver has done a very good job of painting Core as a group of subversive developers with evil intentions to keep bitcoin from scaling. I don't agree with this view. But Roger (a natural con man) is very persuasive. On the other hand, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke-Jr, et. al. speak truths but lack persuasion. They lack the polish and experience with public relations that Roger Ver clearly has. Any obstacles to bitcoin's growth are non-technical at this point.

The problem is that outside people who are not technically savvy, come into bitcoin and see this divide and don't really understand enough to know who the good guys are.

It should trade at a discount but not at such a big discount. Like options that expire worthless, most of the value in BCU should be up front (i.e. now) and it will slowly lose value over time, losing most of its value just before the expiration. The current discount unambiguously signals that the fork will be valued less by the market.

Arguments for bigger blocks and arguments against segwit absolutely should be banned, no questions asked. That doesn't mean that those debates aren't worth having, but they do not belong here. I fully support heavy moderation for those discussions, which should be considered strictly off-topic.
Quite frankly, I'm surprised the moderators of r/bitcoin aren't doing more - if I was a moderator I would scrub the subreddit clean of any such comments, past, present, and future.
Also you are unqualified to render any technical opinion on the merits of either big blocks or segwit. And I'm probably unqualified as well although likely more qualified than you. Developing software using "democracy" is a stupid idea and it should be put down whenever it pops up.

Hmm... I see a problem with this report. It quotes the metric of "capitalization by transactions" which presumably is the sum of value transferred across all transactions in the time period. But this fails to take into account the splitting of a balance into the payment and leftover change. Thus it significantly overstates the true transaction cap., which cannot be calculated with precision since the information on which portion of each transaction is change, is not on the blockchain.

My understanding is that no BTC actually changes hands. So there is no rehypothecation taking place.

In a way, he's kind of right (but without knowing it). The property of being "money" is not like a light switch, on or off. Instead it is a continuum. On one hand you have things that don't resemble money at all. Like grains of sand, or air. On the other hand you have things that clearly function as money, such as USD or the Euro. But there is a bunch of stuff in the middle that resembles money to a greater or lesser extent than not. Bitcoin more closely resembles money than any other cryptocurrency. But it is clearly not the same as USD. Gold also functions as money, also somewhere in the middle not the equivalent of USD. Money is primarily a social phenomenon. Bitcoin at first did not resemble money at all. 10 years later, it is well on its way to becoming money, and I have no doubt that it will displace all other forms of money on the way to maximalist dominance.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:23:34
I see, so the trading desk has to buy some bitcoin to have on hand, and this buying will put upward price pressure on the associated order books. If clients want to sell bitcoin they transfer it to the trading desk, and the trading desk either buys more futures or sells off the BTC (which would put downward pressure on the order books).
