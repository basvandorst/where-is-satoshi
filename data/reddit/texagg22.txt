Dude...do I already gave you a chart from Bloomberg..what more do you want? Why are you trying to argue I am just giving you facts man. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:11:14
Listen guys you idiots keep attacking like I made up the fact that bitcoin was the largest bubble of all time. It’s a fact, I didn’t make it up.

Yeah man, but look at a linear chart, all those other bull runs were fractions compared to the last one. The last one was astronomical

The only use case for bitcoin is to either engage in criminal activity using your coins or sell them at a higher price than you paid to a bigger sucker than yourself. Other than that they are totally worthless

Absolutely hilarious...haha oh man what a total scam this entire space is. I actually feel sorry for some of the perma bulls. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:18:41
Bro, I am not bitter at all...I am just pointing out FACTS...I am trying to wake people up to the reality of what is going on. I want the best for my fellow man and trying to wake people from the fog of this cult is difficult but needed work. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:06:15
Yeah...Pointing out facts about the greatest bubble of all time...is despair? Ok friend
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:50:25
I find it hilarious how bitcoin schills ignore facts...lmao did you read the article today about how 95 percent of all trading volume is fake?? hahaha I bet that is just FUD as well right? Perma bulls never cease to amaze me
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:19:42
What I am saying is very very simple, factually the bitcoin run of 2017 was the biggest bubble of all time and an objective look at that would mean the party is most likely over for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:05:31
LoL...I have been short every rally since April my friend
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:17:50
bitcoin schills in disbelief

I hand out free advice because I am trying to warn everyone man! You people all just think bitcoin is going to magically go back up...bulls don’t seem to understand the party is over...the nut blew at 20k...the.largest.bubble.ever....are you dense or trolling ?

@_date: 2019-03-12 16:38:46
The last bear market was not “the greatest bubble in all of history”..what part of that are you missing ?
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:15:34
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:43:09
What is so interesting is how I am personally attacked for pointing out a simple fact. Instead of talking about that fact you guys attack me personally. You guys have no answers! Just hope that bitcoin will go up...wake up and smell the tulips !
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:33:49
Are you talking about other historic bubbles or are you talking about bitcoin to bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:45:28
Ok I know you are having a lot of trouble understanding me ... it’s different because it was factually the biggest bubble of all time in 2017...bitcoin blew the most epic bubble load of all time... that means what happened was incredibly rare...you think it will just casually happen again ??
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:15:57
No idea how this is even news, Icahn himself admits in the article that he has no idea what bitcoin is all about! lol @ mainstream media. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:59:57
Good Idea but I am sure that was deleted ages ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:20:23
Yeah, my point exactly, they aren't intereted in some legit technical analysis they just want the opinion of some billionaire who got all his goodies from fiat. Just saying. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:26:07
Can you bring the Chinook ?
