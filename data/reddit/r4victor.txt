If you decide to accept cryptocurrency payments by yourself you need to handle the following:
* develop a POS UI
* do a price conversion if your prices are in fiat
* get a unique receiving address for each invoice
* monitor transactions and the blockchain to identify when the status of the payment changes
Cryptocurrency payment processors handle this for you. Most of them are in form of SaaS and provide a custodial service i.e. the payments go to their wallet and you receive money by requesting a withdrawal. The examples are BitPay, CoinGate, CoinPayments and many others.  Such solutions have POS apps. However, they control your money and I would recommend choosing between them if and only if you need a conversion to fiat. An example of a non-custodial SaaS solution would be Coinbase Commerce. CC claims it doesn't store your private keys which is great, but it doesn't have a POS interface, so you have to make it by yourself. There is also a fully featured self-hosted solution called BTCPay Server. You can install it by yourself or use a third-party hosting. You'll gain a lot in terms of independence by choosing it.  
I made a comparison chart of cryptocurrency payment processors, so you can browse it to find one that fits your case best. You can found it [here](  
Note that if you want to accept payments physically, you have to accept unconfirmed transactions, because it can take several minutes to several hours to confirm.
