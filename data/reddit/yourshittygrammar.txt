Thanks for the very helpful response!
A followup I have is that I now have my wallet with one HD account and 3 private keys (i've done 2 transfers into the wallet - one small test and one larger one).
Should I make a HD account for each transaction I make, or just keep one HD account within the wallet, and let it generate keys/addresses each time I want to transfer into it? I can see it's changing the public address each time I successfully complete a transfer in.
Also in response to your followup further down the thread, I would like to share the fees I've paid so far on an initial purchase of $1000AUD (approx $750 USD)
I bought $1k of bitcoin and ended up with approx $900 of bitcoin in my account on an exchange. They said they only charge 3% but it ended up being more like 10-15% for some reason. Quite disappointing.
Then I transferred off a small amount to test the transfer into my own wallet and they charged 0.00054BTC which was approx $10AUD for a$19 transaction. Approx 50% fees.
Then I transferred off the remainder, and they charged the same fee amount, which was approx $10AUD on an $870 transaction. That's a little over 1% which is much better than 10% or 50% but it all adds up. Easy to see how all these guys are making money from us.
Lessons learned today!

If you don't want to pay any taxes how will you get infrastructure like roads built?
