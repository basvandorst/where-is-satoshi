Why don’t you just use Gemini?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:06:47
Yeah but they could always buy bitcoin cash
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:59:18
So that means we can safely hodl until 2025
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:48:46
Why dn’t you just use Gemini?

There have beem numerous postings about tether in different subs from different peole, i don’t get where its coming from
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:26:48
Or they vlcan bring it back to 20k and short it again?
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:21:41
Laundry money, sure does

Visiting from ethtrader
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:36:23
Interesting, they’ve been posting in ethtrader and in cryptocurrency, its very annoying.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:41:27
haha, i didn't know reddit removed comments. I don't really get the joke still, but oh well.

Wall street
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:51:26
Because not many people would accep it and how would it work. There would be confusion.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:12:07
At leadt the pizza was good
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:52:29
Cryptos been outsourced
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:29:09
When they ask do we need to say bitcoin or can we say stocks, will they know?
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:05:09
The dude deleted his acct, prob didnt mean it
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:01:08
Preety sure wallstreet went full bear on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:59:41
Thanks for the insight
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:07:32
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:50:39
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:38
I agree, they will do the same to Gemini
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:10:33
My parents learned about btc recently and asked how many i have. I said a very small amount.  It’s like winning the lottery, not worth the trouble of telling anyone how much you own.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:07:10
Can this gif be stickied, i just live watching it over and over
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:38
Do you really want your parents giving you advice on when to buy and sell and give you tips when they don’t even know how to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:52:57
DEC. 31st, second crypto mega boom
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:43:57
My dad also wanted to buy at ATH because this is when the media was blowing it up as a get rich quick scheme. I did not help him buy any and turned out to be a good decision.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:13:05
What kind of tech?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:23:17
We should all strive to be like pine from pineapple fund and think about ways to change the world.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:24:11
Novogratz backed out of the bitcoin hedge fund
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:11
because they added a coin you don't like?
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:25:36
This is true and it makes me sad when i see people trying to get into crypto for the sole reason of getting rich and not understanding what we’re trying to do.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:15:11
Today my dad said bitcoin isn’t doing well and is going bankrupt
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:56:37
When people could’t get their bcash from coinbase after the fork people complained and threatened lawsuits. Now they’ve added it and people are complaining about it being added. I don’t get it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:50:23
Remember that winklevii are not even considering selling until the crypto market approaches the valuation of the gold market. These guys are billionaires for a reason.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:28:26
What is pineapple fund
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:16:57
I think there’s just a part of the population that will never understand bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:40:13
Some of us don’t know how to
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:17:52
One of my family members tried buying last week before the crash and said his order was cancelled because they were overloaded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:36:03
Keep in mind that next year we should have bitcoin ETFs that will create so much fomo, plus increased adoption and awareness, you will see 25k next year.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:14:29
What are you doing here, party’s in ethtrader
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:33:39
Be careful, someone is sending messages about contacting a hacker to help get more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:09:03
I am concerned about  what does he mean by this?  
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:05:04
No i really don’t. Just a small fry.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:17:06
Winklevii are not considering selling any bitcoin until the value of all bitcoin in circulation approaches the value of all gold in the world and even then they're not sure they would sell.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:11:17
That makes sense, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:33:00
do not sell your bitcoins to wall street
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:42:54
This is what gives me confidence to hold long-term and they are the main reason i invested in bitcoin early on. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:23:25
I think some of the noobs got scared off by the price drop
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:17
who cares, if people want to buy bitcoin cash then let them. if you don't then don't buy it. simple as that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:39:34
Pretty cool
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:28:55
there are other exchanges where you can sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:59:36
With 2 bitcoins on coinbase there’s double supply with littke difference between them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:05:12
That looks painful
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:35:14
Why don't you guys start a Change.org petition?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:42:42
Small amount = 1 btc
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:56:45
No it’s you guys creating the problem. Most people buying bitcoin have no clue who riger vir is.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:25:49
Been thinking about this a lot and I honestly wouldn’t even know what to do. Seems safer to just keep it in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:42:05
Do you think roger ver ever had trouble sleeping with all his bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:53:45
in the end i hope it benefits everyone
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:22:44
Why not get a prenup?
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:06:10
Yeah i was at the dentist and it came on today
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:16:44
No i mean being around crypto billionaires all the time
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:55:07
Imminent? Should we do something?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:56:34
I'm 80% in crypto already, but the opportunity here is too good to pass up. Eventually it's going to turn and then it will be too late.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:55:37
I love paying taxes
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:55:22
Crypto is the best thing thats happened to me in years
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:24:00
I was “hacked” and lost all my bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:09:34
i'm actually holding ETH, but i can't post there cause my account is new.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:51:53
Mysterious pineapple fund
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:35:00
These guys are solid, have not cashed out any bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:54:58
I bought it under 7k, every crash i add to my position near the bottom somehow
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:26:59
I would buy under 8k, around 7300
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:33:19
That sounds awesome, thanks for the info.  I’m mainly looking for a place to retire where i wouldnt be bored all day.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:56:01
This seems like a terrible place to live, just cause of the type of people you would be surrounded with all the time (crypto billionaies like roger ver)
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:11:35
You are the type of people that i despise holding bitcoin, wish it would be better people than you
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:25:33
Does it mean we won’t make as much?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:46:12
I couldn't help myself, had to buy more bitcoin. i'm optimistic about the future of crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:21:51
Buy the indian coins
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:00:11
Yup old news.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:30:35
No one cares
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:00:11
I bought at 9900
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:35:40
does anyone else feel bad that most of us early adopters will become rich, while everyone else can barely buy 1 whole bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:25:04
Because when you married you gave up rights to that property
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:16:16
Most of us have too
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:12:40
Could still go lower but i will DCA over the next few weeks
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:53:54
Novogratz predicted it

Coin fan
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:50:39
Crypto lives matter
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:28:52
Visa sabotaging coinbase?
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:04:22
I imagine a bunch of people so in love with money that they’re willing to give up citizenship to a country most people dream of coming to.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:04:44
Thats why i want to marry someone with their own crypto stash
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:50:01
I just want to eat the pizza
