Makes sense, since if you're holding bitcoin now you're getting fucked...

It does not matter what your tax accountant/tax lawyer/tax advisor thinks.
It's what the IRS says.
Trying to pull a fast one is just asking for trouble.

They won't care. 
You won't have access to the full amount for a few days (that is, you can't just immediately make say a debit purchase for the full deposit) until the bank determines it's "really all there".
If anything, they start to kiss your behind when six/seven figure deposits show up, offering private banking services, etc.
Don't sweat it.

Sounds legit.
Can you handle a new account with over 100k count of bitcoins?
I'd like to sell all 100k immediately, would prefer cash, but real estate or camels are fine too.
If interested, let me know ASAP. We can then arrange a small payment from you to ensure your interest and bona fides.
I will PM you with bank transfer information on your reply.
With best wishes,

That clown took speaking lessons from the Hitler School of Oration, just skipped the Yelling 101 course. 
You know shit''s going to be hitting the fan when the "Come pay real dollars for my Tony Robbins style babblings about making you money" bozos come out of the woodwork.
Have some gold, I LOL'd at your comment.
