Just got my tipping account set-up, but don't have anything to tip...

That is something I haven't considered.  I was hoping to avoid any central exchange or purchasing site, though.  Wanting to focus on the one-to-one benefits of BTC.

first time tip...here ya go 5 bits @_date: 2014-08-24 10:10:29
I emailed MIT a couple of weeks ago to discuss their program and the guy who emailed back said they were still working-out the details.  I am looking to implement a similar (albeit, smaller) program at my kids high school.  Need approval and decide who gets the BTC--it's a K-12 school.

This was an awesome project!  Hope to see more redditers follow suit.

My initial thinking was to get the students involved in exchanging BTC between themselves.  It would be beneficial if the snack stand took BTC or even the lunchroom.  There are plenty of online stores that accept BTC that may interest high school kids: CollectorsCache.com, Gyft.com, etc.

You also may want to look at [Solarcoin]( for rewards on all solar power generated (not just the excess).

I am still very skeptical at this point.  I did some archive digging myself and found [thebcci.net]( was used for email addresses for [thebostongroup.org](  Their first web page lists  [bilal as a contact.  Site has Pakistani background.  That email belongs to Bilal Zuberi who is now with Lux Capital. Does any of this lend to any creditbility?

Someone faking this would be sure to get that right.  right?  This and the "BBCI"/"BCCI" typo and the overall relaxed feel lends to its credibility IMO.

From the press release:
 ***About Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance (SNR) Holdings***
*Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance (SNR) Holdings is in the business of providing superior Blockchain technologies to help transform people’s lives. For more information, please visit* [*** *or follow  on Twitter.*
Sounds like a business to me and not a person.

I had no idea he had himself cryo'd.  Wow.  It makes me sad to think that it could be him and he fell so ill (ALS) and passed before seeing the full potential of BTC.  Of course, with the advancements in cryogenics over the next 100 years or so, he may have the last laugh.

This.  Different, indeed.
