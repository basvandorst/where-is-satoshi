It is being debated but the majority thinks it is legit. 
Of course there is a growing number of those who want a time stamp with Nakamotos brother using the latest cover of playboy while wearing a shoe on his head. Hope this helps.

This unfortunate issue is simply, real life proof, that collision attacks do occur.

Thank you Andreas.
Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto did NOT create Bitcoin.
Crony Capitalism did. Political whores did. Our apathetic attitude towards the kleptocracy did. 
Now, an ailing 64 year old man is being dragged through hell by vulture journalists. Whether or not he was the author of the original white paper is irrelevant. Bitcoin was birthed by forces far greater than any one man or woman. We should all respect the desire of the creator to remain anonymous. It is the least we can do for someone who has blessed the world with an innovation that will fundamentally improve lives.

How do you shut down a decentralized, open source platform? You don't. 
Open Bazaar has suffered from usability issues, not legal ones. Arresting it's development team for illegal items being sold, is like arresting Tor developers for child porn. 
So, law enforcement's best option is to go after users, which is what the future platform updates, mentioned in the OP, are about.

Nice site and great job promoting Bitcoin in an easy to understand manner. One suggestion, if I may, that echos others here, please remove any mention of Coinbase in your post. 
Hookers following your advice will have their BTC frozen if Coinbase becomes even remotely suspicious. Plus, Coinbase will roll on you if the feds so much as look at them. They work very hard at being super legit and a money laundering investigation would be a death knell.

Source? 
Edit to clarify: Coinbase doesn't approve?  Or did you mean Coinbase suspects a violation of financial laws?

Mike Hearn relayed an email from Satoshi that explains the choice of 21 million Bitcoin:

Indeed. Numbers are fun.
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were killed on 06-12-1994. If we add all the digits, we get 32. The jersey number synonymous with OJ Simpson...
But yeah, I agree that Satoshi wasn't concerned with arbitrary numbers.

Buy 3k worth of Bitcoin instead.

A short drive down to the local drug corner would suffice.

An exchange with a short name that starts with **G** and ends with **X** . I'm experiencing an urge to pull every penny out and run.

I'm fuzzy, but I know that the Genesis block was before the v0.1 release. 
Edit: So, block 1-14 was mined on the 8th of January 2009. I'm under the impression v0.1 was released on the 9th. However, this could all be a issue of time zone. But to the point; 1-14 would be SN.

I just experienced deja vu. Felt like I was back in 2013.

IIRC, SN mined one block on Jan 3, 2009. Tweaked the code and the mined dozens of blocks in one continuous period on the 8th. The released v0.1 on the 9th. We could check blockexplorer, but assuming my memory is correct, any movement of those coins mined on the 8th, would prove to me, beyond a reasonable doubt, that CW killed the original SN and stole the keys. Heh.

No you couldn't, because that is not logic. That is argumentum ad absurdum.
People attempting to 'break' Bitcoin either helps Bitcoin, or destroys it. The result is that we get something better.

IIRC, Dorian was born Satoshi Nakamoto and later changed his name to Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto. Not really sure where we're going here, but I just wanted your comment to receive some attention.

Excellent. Gold for you!
