Yeah. Goes into the direction I was thinking. Bitcoin is nice because we have control over our money and its cheap. But it is only cheap because we inflate the currency atm. There is a reason banks and money transmitters need to operate with fees.

You dont really consider the real problem at hand do you ;)?
It is amazing how defensive this community is when it comes to discussing the core problems and how to solve them. First thing seems to be blind optimism :( (which is nice in a way as long as some people think about the problems)

Yes, but the equilibrium is a really low hashrate in this case. It self regulates to this low hashrate. Miners will mine at electricity costs. And even 1000 dollars per block would result in a too low hashrate.

Then I dont need bitcoin. I already have the possibility of moving money with my bank for free (in europe).

We inflate bitcoin by 10% per YEAR right now. Compare this to fiat ;)
But yeah, my example was not the best. Just wanted to point out how we pay for the hashrate right now.

Your answer makes sense. And it makes me feel more comfortable about using bitcoin. Thanks :)

Well it is optimistic if you look at block sizes we can still handle! 10'000 txn p2p is impossible.

It is a thought ;) i love bitcoin and also think about its future and this is the only thing i am afraid about right now.
