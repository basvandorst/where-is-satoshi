urm this?
No one in this thread was a rude as you say, infact no one in that thread was rude at all, You got a nice polite answer and a normal answer, what do the upvotes matter when your question was answered?
Thankyou for the BTC, perhaps it will finally push me to make a wallet and get a exchange account!
I'm going to sleep now I should have been asleep 2 hours ago :P but seriously have a look at bitcoin beginners (even if you arn't a beginner any-more).
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:06:21
Yeah if you expect anyone to believe that this hasn't been invaded then your dreaming.
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:06:12
ah my bad.
Anyhow there is work being done on measures that would decrease the likely hood of 51% attacks however at the moment I believe they requirethe cooperation of the pools.

You really think a post in praising dogecoin and full of doge jokes got voted to the **3rd** highest in the sub without brigading?
Lets not even mention the cross post that was in You are free to see the world through whatever filter you feel necessary, have fun.
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:48:44


You can't deny that a lot of subs in here have an "elitist" mentality.
I'm not saying ALL of the posters in this sub do, just that there ARE a lot who do.
you know if you read the sidebar there is a sub specifically for newbs right?
If you upvoted the post and you are not a part of this community then you are a part of the vote brigading, if you were already a part of this community then that is fine.
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:34:41
aye, I just checked in on again and read a bit through the Bitcoin wtf post, Whislt the way they talk grinds me the wrong way it does seem that a lot of the community does want friendly relations with Bitcoin etc and perhaps I am judging them too harshly.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:58:06
look if you don't understand how subreddits work then there is no point trying to explain brigading to you.
go to ELI5 and I am sure they will be willing to help you out.
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:01:15
I suppose it does conduct quite well.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:02:29
Well brigading is one reason.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:50:54
well I'm not wrong so...
Brigading is bad.
It doesn't even matter if you don't agree because the site rules agree.

Selling your phone doesn't send the same message as destroying it.
I don't think it's innapropriate but your suggested course of action is equally valid, of course selling it doesn't gives Apple a new customer and so you are still supporting Apple. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:46:05
Reducing to the level of i know you are but what am I.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:57:12
I'll just copy and paste some of the comments as they seems to fit this nicely.


Then it dawned on me... The Shibes are all here right now :P
The amount of people refering to as if they were not apart of it is also very high.
and then the huge use of the dogecointip bot, it is considered bad form to tip in subreddits that havn't given permission.

If you convert American Dollars into Euro, the Dollars are no longer Euro =&gt; you are taking the native currency into the native place.
Look this conversation is pointless, I think youre an idiot, you no doubt think I'm an idiot, now lets part ways.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:11:44
lol, and there you go again.
Well have fun in kindergarden kid.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:30:11
The good people of ELI5 have much to teach you.
You can hold the playground insults, idc.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:37:31


It clearly was.
The comments section is proof enough.


If it's still there for you then I probably blocked it, my bad.
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:20:34
ah, well sometimes dickheads find posts, I find the Bitcoin community to be good for discussion and such and I don't really like the circlejerk like comment sections of just personal preference I guess.
@_date: 2014-02-09 20:11:02


You clearly have no idea what brigading is.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:57:24

Banks only refund you a certain amount so it's not 100% false...
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:01:12


If your going to assert something atleast use the right word.
Iama hypocrite.
now can you please shut up?
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:44:53
A country that harbors sex offenders bans bitcoin and it's ironic?
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:50:04
Which completely ignores the vote brigading that was evident earlier.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:51:21
Well on reddit, people = account
Alternative = Alt
So Alt accounts are the people with really weird 'alternative' kinks.
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:21:46


No, I'm equating a question thread with how many upvotes those usually get and seeing similarities.


Or the person was shadowbanned for a different reason.
needless to say minor brigading is always going to happen, major brigading needs to be stamped on hard.

Modern currency's arn't backed by Gold anymore...
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:27:16


pfft, Talk about cherry picking, look at the shit talks.
It is not your place to invade othersubreddits and if you make a habit of it then you'll get shadowbanned.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:37:50


and had some spare australian, or american... it would be rude?
Are you joking or...?
American Money is not legal tender in Germany.
Australian Money is not legal tender in the US.
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:57:43


There is an entire different subreddit for newbies to ask questions in, this one is not it. check the sidebar, I've looked at a load of the replies and the answers all seem really good?


Was anyone rude to you or were you just downvoted? sometimes posts just don't make it past 'new, it only takes a few asshats downvoting it to keep it down.


Then obv you have a right to influence the voting.
Thanks for the tip :P I can't make a wallet or whatever until I sort out my laptop and send ID to the exchange (I'm paranoid about sending ID over internet :/ ) so I'm afraid I can't accept.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:36:36
I.. You win.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:51:13
It is harmful.
Each subreddit is it's own community.
If one subbreddit invades another it is attacking the others community.
The post that was brigaded got upvoted to the top of by people who are not a part of thereby forcing their message and beliefs on us.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:57:19
Okay you don't acknowledge brigading, thats nice. good day.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:26:25
The post that was brigaded became the 3rd highest voted topic in all of s history, because it was brigaded by @_date: 2014-01-15 23:06:40

I'd agree with you if it was just a few people, but that post currently has like net 2800 upvotes, front page material on this sub normally gets like what 400 upvotes? doge mods should lay down the law in their sub in response to this. 
edit: yeah I just went on 's and all I see is skin deep good will.
@_date: 2014-02-05 23:16:14


Yes clearly expecting every post to do well is 'mental gymnastics'.


Minor brigade about a minor topic and its not even certain that it was brigaded.


You saw it get shadowbanned and therefore you know the reason... the mental gymnastics...


There was x-post in .
The linked thread then became a hive of doge meme's where any post that disagreed with 'doge iz great!!' was heavily downvoted. 
If you think it wasn't heavily brigaded you are a moron.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:46:19


see, this is yet another problem to highlight with the attitude in i don't care what subreddit i am, dogecoin, litecoin, fedoracoin, mooncoin, bitcoin WHATEVER, if someone wants to tip it, just fucking tip it.
it is widely accepted by most subreddits that tipping (which = advertising) is bad form if the subreddit hasn't given permission.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:13:13
That they won't use Apple products or support the use of Apple products if they are going to ban Bitcoin Apps?
Pretty good message.
@_date: 2014-02-05 10:41:51
The post you've linked is Bitcoin related and only has 20 upvotes, hardly brigaded.
The post that dogecoin brigaded became third on our best of all time list.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:24:30
You know that is what happened before the post was removed right?
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:42:30
I think any post that is being heavily influenced from outside sources should be removed, otherwise the community can decide.
@_date: 2014-02-07 13:32:11
You apparently don't know what brigading is.
