There is, but unfortunately it does not have WIFI Explorer on it yet. iOS doesn't give us the ability to use the radios the way Android does.
Gare du Nord should still show up on the iOS map though. :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:15:54
It's out, it just lacks this functionality at the moment. I will let everyone know when we manage to add it for iOS!
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:08:28
Wow! Thank you so much for the coverage!
We plan on doing a much bigger reward in a month or two if this gets some traction with the community. I want to add an active scoreboard, with the top 5 receiving bitcoin winnings and not just the first place user, and make it a regular tipping celebration!
That is very kind of you to even mention us in the same block as Lighthouse.
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:22:58


I've had a similar issue as well and reported it to the dev team. It's definitely an area that needs improvement ASAP.


Thank you for pointing this out. There are a few reasons: at some hotspots, we may not have been able to fully verify all the information because of the way it's structured (perhaps it's a very specific captive portal or "check the box"). So you're awarded partial credit (4 points) but there's an anti-spam kind of measure in place that stops the user from retrying. But I agree it is annoying. I will try to have this remedied.


This one is in the log already! I concur. We should have an update that includes not only "our" list but the list of nearby SSID in full, and the SSID associated with "our" list.


Excellent point. I had encountered this as well but very rarely--in a dense spot I could see this becoming a problem. We'll solve this one ASAP.


That sounds likely: perhaps it was struggling to find the server in that environment. I've relayed your comment.
I really appreciate the detailed response about your experience.
Have 2 beers @_date: 2015-01-21 20:59:59
We plan to do much larger rewards more to your liking in the coming months and are open to improvements if people like the program - this is what we can support today as we're starting out.
But you can't spend Olive Garden bux at Overstock! :(

What's the best way to print your work if we do it ourselves? What steps are involved after I download an image?
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:21:04
Correct :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:07:40
Yes! You can use the app anywhere on Earth, and we'll send you bitcoin.
However, I am not sure the exact distribution across the Google Play store of the app - for example, we actually appear in the German store apparently, but it pulls our English text since we haven't made that translation yet.
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:19:47
Actually yes, sometimes! If someone adds a hotspot, it can still be verified later if they never bothered to do it.
Another scenario that is possible: one or two people verify a hotspot and only receive 4 points - because for one reason or another we cannot entirely confirm or integrate the hotspot. But eventually it should confirm and the last person might sweep up the 10 points.
This most often would happen with a chain hotspot operated by a contractor. We're resolving this issue, but sometimes they're tough for the app to talk to. Your average hotspot should be easy to verify the first time.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:13:42
The points are pegged to bits in the near term, and the 500,000 bits for leader will be guaranteed the entire year. If you saw BTC hit $2000 in July, 0.5 BTC would still be tipped. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:28:16
I hear you. The app is really simple at the moment, but I definitely want to get this kind of stuff implemented.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:31:23
Awesome! I think so too. I think travelers and tourists could benefit a lot from a strong network that is locally developed! Have a coffee to start your journey. :)

@_date: 2015-01-21 19:49:50
Definitely, it is easier in dense WiFi areas.
PM me with your account email after you sign-up so I can track it, I'd love to figure out a solution for this in less dense areas, because we're all from bigger cities, it's not something we've focused on yet. We'll get you some tips. :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:06:04
The points are pegged to bits, not fiat. So, if the price increases, we will not be scaling down the reward for at least the first half of the year (barring an anomalous price run up).
We do enable you to add public hotspots that are closed, such as a coffee shop. And you can add private hotspots that only appear to you, however there is no tip for those. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:09:55
We are for the time being!
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:29:04
Yes! If you have an Android device, it should be available on the Google Play store. Search WIFI Metropolis and follow [this tutorial]( to add and then verify hotspots.
Let me know if you're unable to download. It's only available in English, French, and I think Spanish at this point, so I hope that's okay! PM if you have any trouble downloading.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:11:03
Please let me know how it goes! We don't have any hotspots there yet - which is a place this could be a lot more useful, I imagine. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:23:04
Indeed. Right now the VPN is pretty simple and helps with local security, but we hope to add a little more customized features for advanced users in the future and add more providers. For example, I might want to access an Amazon or Netflix I own that's blocked in the country I traveled - so I might want to select my home country as VPN in this case.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:59:29
There is an iOS app but we do not yet have the capacity to employ this part of the app. iOS simply won't let us talk with the radios the way Android does.
We're still working on it!
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:03:01
Of course, it read the word "shot" first and gave you a shot. Don't get too drunk.

have some eyedrops @_date: 2015-01-21 17:08:03
I hope so. The idea is if some users are paving the way for actual utility in their own life, it makes the network *much* more useful for general usership versus a top down approach of trying to license a bunch of hotspots and force users to use them or offer paid subscriptions that only work in certain areas.

Are you referring to the captive portal that is operated by someone else? In the next version or two we will have this issue resolved!
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:33:08
We're backed up--volume is more than 4x what we expected. Try again in about an hour!
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:35:17
The application is only on Android devices. There is no way to interact in a browser yet. A plug-in will be developed later this year.
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:39:37
It is not like bitmesh, yet. Long term, I see mesh in our future. :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:49:28
You can also add public "closed" hotspots. For example, if there's a high traffic independent coffee shop which has a password that never changes, we are able to verify those as well.
Additionally, you can integrate your own private hotspots without them being on the public map if you so choose.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:30:31
You can find hotspots around the world on the map screen. Green and Blue hotspots will seamlessly connect as you go from one to the next, even if you've never been there before (if you have autoconnect enabled).
You can add more hotspots to the network and make it more useful if you switch to "Explorer Mode." Everytime you add/verify, you accrue points. You can redeem those points for Bitcoin. **Verifying puts more Green hotspots on the map for everyone to use.**
There is no possible way for us to devise the highest utility network from the top down--we are deferring wisdom to you: *where do you like to connect, what are the best cafes for connecting, where's the best place to out-of-towners who cannot afford data roaming to connect easily?*
EDIT: We also have free VPN. It's really simple right now, but we'd like to introduced advanced features like choosing the exit country, etc.
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:48:45
[See this tutorial for adding hotspots]( It's pre-Coinbase integration but the process is essentially the same.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:29:42
The app won't discriminate access points after you verify--you can add dd-wrt et al to the network if it's available.
Perhaps a more systemic integration is what you're thinking e.g. all dd-wrt read with WIFI Metropolis and vice-versa? Could you elaborate on what you're envisioning?
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:37:19
Overall, no. There are a few people who added a lot of subscriber-type locations. But you're probably okay if it's not over 75% of your adds.
Special exception for you being quite nice about it. :) PM me your registered email and I'll give you a little extra BTC.
Think about it like this: we're giving a reward payout. That costs something. If you're not consciously spamming clearly useless hotspots you're doing wonderfully.
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:26:43
A couple people have mentioned issues but others are going well. What's the nature of your issue? Want to PM me a screen?
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:15:31
I know, it's painful... iOS just won't let us integrate the add hotspot feature as well.
We will be developing a plugin for browsers--that's a possible workaround later this year.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:41:26
We'll add this function soon, probably with the private hotspots first actually.
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:56:48
There is an iOS version and you can use the entire network with it. However, this "add a hotspot" feature is limited to adding private hotspots on iOS.
iOS simply does not allow apps to communicate with the WiFi radio directly for their own purposes. We're still working on a solution, but it has been a difficult problem to port this feature from Android to iOS, to say the least.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:42:56
We're a little backed up, our volume today was huge. Give us a little bit and it should be ready soon!

Can't wait to read this. Have 1000 bits @_date: 2015-04-13 22:05:16
Yes, but there's a little more than just documenting involved. When you "Verify" a hotspot you've added to the map, it additionally enables someone who has never been in the area before to automatically connect. You're adding functionality and verifying existence physically.
So, if you travel to Paris right now, you will be able to seamlessly connect to hundreds (perhaps thousands, I haven't checked lately) of hotspots. You have full access to them for free because (a) we integrated them or (b) someone in Paris already did for you. Or (c) you found a shop you liked and added it yourself!
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:14:24
You da man! 10,000 bits @_date: 2015-04-29 18:20:41
Is this in today's paper edition as well?
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:59:11
You must have GPS-enabled when you add a new hotspot to the map, and you must be within radius of the green circle that appears around your blue GPS dot (approximately half a kilometer).
SSID, BSSID, MAC, geo-location--a series of values are required to verify a location. I suppose you could try to exploit this but the reward for doing so is quite paltry--assuming we didn't catch you spoofing long before you verified 40 hotspots and gamed us out of $20.
I doubt anyone would do $500 of labor for $1.50 to $50 of bitcoin--or $0 because we catch you.
@_date: 2015-04-17 23:53:35
Good amendment. :)
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:31:59
It could be your data being limited in the mall - were you losing your signal in the building? That is a common way of blocking service to WIFI Metropolis servers if you completely lack a quality connection either via WiFi or data.
@_date: 2015-04-14 00:39:20
Most Captive Portals tend to be tricky.
Adding a Starbucks or chain is easy (although we likely already webcrawled it). Verifying it is hard for the software to do, I'd just take your two points for adding and move on. Don't bother attempting to verify wonky captive portals outside of just dropping them as a pin to let people know it exists on the map.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:54:01

The iOS app can be [found here.]( But for now it only has private hotspot adding. It has been a great problem porting the WIFI Explorer features over to iOS.
It simply doesn't allow the same freedom to apps to use radios as Android does.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:47:21
I saw this error... :(
Your verification email is valid and no one else received the same one. A script error resulted in false cc's.
So your link works just fine and no one else saw the same email. But unfortunately some people see other users.
@_date: 2015-04-29 21:12:07
As in, the link and email itself were different--every single person received a unique email verification (otherwise the link wouldn't work for you). The people who appear to be cc'd did not actually receive the same link/exact email. It was not technically a "cc" although it appears that way.
You only received one verification email, not several I hope, correct?
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:29:07
We provide it and budget for it. I have considered making this a self-sustained, maybe even open-sourced function of the app, particularly with funding. I'd love to use Lighthouse, for example, but I've seen most campaign get zero activity on Lighthouse... I don't think there's a good way to crowdfund something like this with bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2015-04-13 22:06:52
Just about! Although, you can keep your home "private" if you don't want it publicly displayed.
We're aiming primarily for public hotspots when you're out and about!

@_date: 2015-04-14 08:51:12
I don't enjoy it either, for the most part. It really depends on the app.
Twitter login for something like Medium or ChangeTip is *awesome*. But as an easy credential tool for standard login, I dislike it for privacy reasons.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:38:32
There is an [iOS version here]( But it doesn't have the level of hotspot adding functionality as Android.
iOS doesn't allow apps to directly use the WiFi radio--Apple's system has full control. Developing a workaround has proven very difficult.

See below comment.
But to answer your question: originally an idea floated around, and still perhaps could be implemented, to allow you to attach an image to the location as a thumbnail. Giving identity to locations when you're scrolling through a list or have one selected.
@_date: 2015-04-17 06:34:05
It needs to be made more clear, but the Private Hotspots are meant for those purposes only--no one else can see them and are for you only, to seamlessly switch between the public and private network.
Thus, we don't have points awarded currently for Private hotspots. However, you should have 12 points for the Verified hotspot.
The edit feature is coming soon! :)

@_date: 2015-04-13 21:20:15
We will try to implement a feature soon that allows you to paste an address to send. What do you think of this idea?
We need Coinbase primarily for the on-demand payment API. If our personal faucet is "dry," it won't stop users from redeeming their coin--Coinbase can still charge us for the market price and deliver your reward immediately. We cannot purchase/send you Bitcoin at the moment of your demand with Bitgo or Copay.
@_date: 2015-04-14 06:25:42
In the next update or two, we're adding a feature wherein you can flag a change and/or edit hotspots only you have added.
PM me the issue and I can change it manually and tip you for it.
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:29:07
Good question. I think once we have more of these issues addressed and refine the current redemption issues, battery drain issues--we'll work on the secondary layer of points (referrals, business enrollment, etc.)
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:30:46
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:37:34
I concur, it needs some better langauge. However, to be frank, it is risky to say, "You earn money from WIFI Metropolis directly." This could imply employment, a taxable event, income, or other regulatory issues.
Just the phrase "to earn money" is an issue. Functionally, you are redeeming points for bitcoin akin to redeeming airline miles for tickets or credit card points for swag.
Also, the majority of users are not bitcoiners (at the moment) but people just using the app for connectivity in UK and France.
@_date: 2015-04-17 22:37:50
Could you PM me your login email please? And then try in about a half hour.
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:41:11
Are you referring to the competition aspect? We will reintroduce competition relatively soon, as you can see there is now a crude leaderboard function in conjunction with Coinbase update.
But we wanted to get Coinbase right before renewing the competitive rewards.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:13:58
No, you're doing everything correctly. Redemption is disabled over the weekend while we fix some things. We should resume next week early.

@_date: 2015-04-14 02:15:17
Could you elaborate? We could definitely look into this.
We're keen on applying some sharing economy, airBnB-style architecture in the future.
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:34:15
I did actually show one of the bosses BitMesh and he quickly poked alleged holes in its implementation!
I think this is a great idea, though. Mesh is definitely on the table--the WiFi landscape in general is due for some massive changes in the next couple years.
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:39:34
It's working now. Give it a go.
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:51:54
Yes, for now. But that doesn't stop you from verifying spots and redeeming later! :)
@_date: 2015-04-14 01:54:10
Could you PM me a screenshot and/or your device specs? 
@_date: 2015-04-14 00:36:23
Not yet, but this is an important feature I want to add.
It was important to get the automation out the door first. This is very close to next on my list.
If you'd like, you can add your Twitter and I can tip via changetip manually--cash out that way.
Otherwise it will be a little bit for the cashout with custom addresses.
For now, earn points, and just don't redeem them until we add this feature! Save up.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:39:48
[It's available here]( but lacks the hotspot adding functionality and Coinbase integration. It's hard to port these features to the iOS version--iOS doesn't like apps talking to the WiFi radio with any degree of control.
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:16:42
We will! :)

Appreciate your error reports, truly. Have a beer @_date: 2015-04-14 17:55:02
iOS does not have Coinbase integration yet, as the Explorer functionality to add hotspots is limited to "private" (e.g. your home or friends houses or office) that do not show for everyone else.
The public hotspot adding feature is difficult to implement on iOS. We will announce when it's available. A possible work around is a browser plug-in released later this year.
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:16:27
I'm going to estimate they will resume on Wednesday. There's been a lot of fixes happening, and you'll get to redeem soon.
Honestly, it simply raced past our expectations for success and we're playing catch up with how awesome you guys are. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:33:03
Thanks for giving it a go! In a couple weeks, it will be WAY easy to earn coin. The redemption of points will be in app, and Bitcoin will go instantly to your Coinbase as if you were redeeming airline miles or credit card points for Bitcoin. In the meantime, add your Twitter so I can tip you! :)
I imagine adding hotspots over time will be a drain due to the GPS--but the act of actually using the network after you've built it is minimal. No location services need to be enabled and even data most of the time.
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:03:28
I think that's a good idea! The issue with that for us would be scaling. The advantage of the Coinbase API being: it can send from our Coinbase to yours instantly, to your email that's registered with us, pegged to the value at that moment and on demand regardless of our BTC balance (it could just charge us fiat). If you've never had BTC before, the API will automatically have the amount waiting for you in your new Coinbase wallet--that's particularly important in new-to-BTC user acquisition and less confusing than copypasta an address from Mycelium or similar.
If we're able to make this compatible with the Coinbase API, I think this is a fantastic idea and I'd add it for you!
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:54:48
That's so cool! :)
In the next version as I said above, you'll be able to redeem points for Bitcoin instantly. One button push.
Would you and the PSU bitcoiners be game for an experiment? We have yet to try geo-targetted rewards. So every hotspot in a particular neighborhood or city would earn bonus points.

Currently, the easiest way for me to (a) track user activity and then (b) deliver bitcoin quickly is with ChangeTip--which allows me to tweet at you tips periodically. Twitter because ChangeTip sync with it!
Apple does not allow its devices to speak to wifi radios as freely as Android. It is currently not technically possible for us to port the Android experience of adding hotspots and seamlessly connecting in an iOS environment. We're working on a solution.

Low density WIFI is like travelling from island to island, but you can still generate a contiguous network experience with the app this way!

Great question. We're still trying to determine a way to manage that. It's common where I'm from as well.
For now, I'd add those hotspots but not verify them. Perhaps in the location details include "(variable password)". 
In the future, there will be a business enrollment program. So they could actually keep changing the password for security reasons but also broadcast a hidden SSID compatible with our app. That's one idea!
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:07:43
Awesome! In what city? 200 bits @_date: 2015-02-12 01:43:48
Yes, we've discussed how this might look. It's definitely going to be added soon for private hotspots. But for ones visible to everyone, our main idea is to create a way to submit changes rather than immediately affect the database so as to prevent spam or bad actors.
Any ideas on how you might want it implemented?
My thinking: have access to your personal list of added/verified hotspots organized by date added and/or ABC. Only you who added could revise directly, and if you encounter others in the world with an error that you did not add yourself, generate a form to report the errors, typos, status updates, etc.

There is an iOS version--the only feature it's lacking is the ability to add hotspots. iOS manages WiFi radio in a more restrictive way--we're still working on a method to employ it in the future.

No problem. We want to replace changetip with a more robust API so it pushes to users automatically. But I also don't want people to then be required to use a particular wallet  (e.g. coinbase) unless they want to.
150 bits @_date: 2015-02-04 03:36:04
It is available on iOS!
But: the WIFI Explorer functions that allow you to add and verify hotspots are still not quite there. iOS heavily restricts the way an application can interact with WiFi radios.
We're still developing a solution. But the app still works with the network itself just fine :)

@_date: 2015-02-11 23:33:23
As in a closed hotspot? Yep! Many hotspots that are public such as local cafés still employ passwords or captive portals. The app will know and ask for the password.
If it's a simple passworded hotspot such as a coffee shop, those are the best ones in fact! Captive portals like Starbucks are a little less friendly.

Short answer: no. Long answer: there is always a way, but it's not cost effective for the person doing it. Verification captures more information about the device than just SSID. Spoofing the MAC to us or other identifying attributes would be most intensive.

They're all yours, baby. 300 bits @_date: 2015-02-04 02:06:36
Please do! That's the idea--we hope most Explorer users at least add all of the hotspots in their own life and thus create their own seamless WiFi experience.
But when peoples paths start to cross, you get a *really* unique and useful network created from the interests of many users.

The application is available on both--but this incentive program is currently only technically possible on Android. Apple restricts the way we can use the WiFi radio severely--we're trying to develop a solution. The network itself is still available on either app and your account is single sign-on between both versions!

Anyone can do it anywhere.
Regarding iPhone: there is a version. But it lacks this WIFI Explorer component. We're working on a solution - iOS is very restrictive on the ways in which apps can use WiFi radios. Android is a relative bastion of freedom. But we're getting close, I think!
