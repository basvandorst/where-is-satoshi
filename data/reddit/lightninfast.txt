I feel need because some people are now putting more they can afford to lose in this w/o knowing much of the underlying currency/company/etc. Lots of innocent people trying to get rich quick can lose a lot real fast!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:32
I can't imagine how many hackers are trying to break down online wallets, exchanges, etc.. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:29:37
These bars look too tempting to buy in right now. Only if I had some spare change.. damnit!
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:30:57
Here you go.. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:21:30
Did you tell him that it is the coin that keeps on giving?! 
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:21:08
I bet it will crash as soon as I buy it or probably go to $5k if I don't touch it. sigh!
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:55:36
Any way to get alerts on when there are large buy/sell order txns?
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:55:53
Wait. Is there a downturn? J/K. Lets go bulllzz! [
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:55:16
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:38:19
Better be 6500 when I get up! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:04:55
Damn. Might hit 7k tonight. Sheez! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:45:04
15k by EOY? 20k by Jan 10th? 30k by Jan 18th?  
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:55:26
Unless he is at the 3 bars in the country that accepts BTC. suckas!
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:52:29
Where are the damn analysis on it hitting $10k?? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:32:52
Can I buy options legally on this? It’s poised for 10k by EOY?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:10:25
 Doesn't seem like its going anywhere.. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:24:52
So will it hit 100k one day?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:52:53
Back to $7000 by Friday?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:43:21
...and down it goes.. I bet it settles below 7k by EOD 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:53:07
Wait - why do you have capital gains if you have been holding &gt; 2 yrs? I thought capital gains is on stuff you own/trade for &lt; 1 or 2 years..
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:00:04
$10K by end of 2017 just became a tad bit more realistic!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:50:29
So, time to short bch?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:57:34
Over $10k by tomorrow and back to 8k after that. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:37:11
$8,600 already. $10k by Christmas!
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:58:32
I have been watching this like a hawk! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:34:16
10k by EOY ? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:10:19
Digital currency news in paper? Boom!
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:57:24
Litecoin makes sense too
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:38:05
Seems like it's back to $4000. Yay!
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:52:51
Why is it going up now? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:12:06
If they do accept crypto, is there a reason why they won’t pick eth or Monero instead of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:16:19
So this is gonna drive the price of BTC down?
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:52:30
Is this why BTC and other coins are down right now?? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:25:34
Now is it time to take profits and move to alts? Who here knows how to time this shit?
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:48:44
But why is it down 9% in 24hrs? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:35:58
So, is it gonna hit 6500 today? :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:50:02
Wow. So what’s the next target? 6,600?
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:44:48
Time to move BTC to ALTS? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:16:43
So. Is this a good time to buy or that train has gone? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 01:44:49
so what happened here? [
are we headed for 10k? Is december coming in August?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:10:56
Next stop - 6600? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:47:23
Look at the line of people waiting to use the machine :/
