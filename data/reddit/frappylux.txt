See the little URL on the photo? r/ . 
Follow the link and you will learn that you can trade a grand total of 5 crypto currencies with 1% fees. 
Compare this to Bitstamp or Kraken which are approx at 0.25%.

Fair point.
Now, what about an ETF in another country (let's say UK or Luxembourg) that doesn't go by SEC rules?
Would it have no chance of succeeding?

I am merely making the hypothesis where major exchanges would decide to self-regulate, for their own good...

To manipulate the market you need to be able to sell or buy a lot.
For that you need an exchange with a lot of liquidity.
That means a major exchange.
Now if all major exchanges have KYC in place... doesn't it make it possible to identify manipulators?

Does the *news manipulation* really work though?
The 4 bear calls mentioned in this video are plotted on [this graph](

It does not mean we are able to harvest it.
There is not enough rare metals on earth of what would be needed to make solar panels for everything and then batteries to store that electricity so it can be used at night or on cloudy days.

People don't need to know how much gold you have any more than they need to know how much bitcoin you have.

Untapped doesn't means it is "tappable". I refer you to r/collapse.
"buyer of last resort": Mining does not stop when there is peak demand of electricity and resume during the night when nobody runs their heating, their lights or their A/C.

it was not a pro-gold post.
having gold does not exclude having bitcoin and does not exclude having food or guns.
gold is not useful at the worst moment when everyone is hungry. Is is useful on the way down to buy what you forgot to prep and it may be useful in case of recovery.

You may want to dollar-cost-average in... (don't invest the 80% in one swoop)

Peaches and peas are not a proper mix of macro nutrients. You need proteins (canned fish, sardines) and fat (oil) in addition to carbs (peaches, peas)

For that case you need a wallet that accepts multiple passwords (i-e: invisible additional wallets accessible via specific passwords)

I don't have time to explain the details. You can find everything in r/collapse .


Yes water and bullets are good things to have. Not nearly sufficient though. I refer you to r/preppers .


Absolutely true. And then some. r/collapse

The first sentence of my posts was "I own some bitcoin".
