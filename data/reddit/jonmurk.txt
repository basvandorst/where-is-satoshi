Elaborate? And what about buying assets, for instance real estate, as bitsteiner suggests?

It's a great inference and I hope that these steps would lead in that direction but don't you think the government and banks will just set new rules? Unless the government directly manipulates these new companies like Coinbase.
My only suggestion to circumvent the headache would be to move to decentralized wallets like Ledger and TREZOR. I just made the switch.

So I have been trying to explain bitcoin to my mom for some time now. She grew up in the hills of Jamaica and is not very technologically savvy, yet I still try. It has been a couple months now that Ive been excited about the technology and have tried to share, if not at least mention, it to people as I feel the urge. Yet, my mom has always processed my explanations as a notion without ground. Well tonight she called me up to her room to show me a clip of an episode from Million Dollar Listing New York. Bitcoin was mentioned, and I couldn't help but smile seeing that she was getting another input from a show that she enjoys. I think she will eventually warm up to the idea soon. I took the liberty of posting the specific clip in the episode on youtube.

I would also like to know

Wow I didn't even catch that

A lot of us are not only in the same boat but others in bigger ones. And some advice: never use multiple 'lol's in succession with each other.

Every time I see and add like this on Craigslist I get a little bit more excited.

I'm 19 and at 3. Keep going man!

I was just looking into Xapo. What are the advantages and disadvantages. Supposedly they are releasing a bitcoin debit card in the near future.

I just bought a ledger nano and saw this option the other day. Brilliant.

Supposedly he's not Japanese. Possibly European because of the way he spelled certain words on forums

Should I cancel the claim and go through Circle again?
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:28:32
Just opened an account with Gemini. Now I'm about to close it.
@_date: 2015-10-28 00:49:37
We haven't spoken since that night.
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:29:33
I didn't not know that it went through escrow. I appreciate the quick reply, thank you!

Thank you for the support man. I will contact her and see if there is any way that the program can recover the deleted data. Yes it did happen a in august; I was furious and still haven't fully come to terms with the situation until recently.
@_date: 2015-10-29 02:55:44
I received the email as well. At least their products are amazing.

*Ledger hardwallet. My apologies for not elaborating. It is a hardwallet that remains in complete control of the user. Check it out here:
As for buying and selling I use circle at the moment (which is not much better than coinbase).

I know, I understand now. I have, and will use this as a lesson for future demonstrations.
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:51:38
It's a trap. Feds would be waiting right under the podium.

You are the first person to understand my wanting to show how easy sending large sums of money is compared to conventional means. I really appreciate the tip. Unfortunately I am a college student and Im poor in comparison to the big picture, but on the flip side it could have been way worst.
EDIT: No more tips though please, I would just like to know if there is a way to retrieve my btc. I also don't want to look like I am asking for handouts.

I have a feeling they will suffer the same fate as Block Buster.
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:52:00
how so?
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:59:31
Ah man that's a bummer. Wasn't there something about utorrent trying to sneak a mining application in along with their traditional service a while ago?
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:26:58
I did call. They said that there was a problem with my card, and there is none.
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:27:05
They just closed my account today as well. I received the same email and am still trying to figure out why. Ironically I was going to switch from their services anyway to an individual account like ledger. In my opinion Coinbase is for new bitcoin users and no one else.

aaaaaand its tanking...
