If you do not understand how it can work that doesn't mean it can't. I'm talking about miners cooperating with each other to get block verification faster.
Something along these lines was listed in ['Alternative or complimentary approaches' part of Gavin's article](


They are unnecessary if miners will deliberately cooperate with each other.


You can communicate all that information _before_ the block is mined.

The attack itself is not nonsensical. Most SPV wallets (and even full nodes that sit behind NAT) connect to a limited number of nodes.
If wallet connects to 10 nodes at random and the attacker controls 99% of all nodes, then the probability that wallet is connected only to attacker's nodes is about 90%. This means that attacker can control the chain that wallet sees.
He can use it for DoS and double-spending attacks. DoS is obvious. As for double-spending, an attacker controlling 10% of total hashpower will be able to get 3 confirmations in 5 hours.
So the attack is real, but it has nothing to do with consensus. And it doesn't work the way OP thinks it works. Attacker doesn't need to run multiple nodes, he can instead create alter identities for his single node using multiple IP addresses.

@_date: 2015-06-20 16:24:00
If we assume a particular shape of the probability mass distribution of Bitcoin price after the attack, we'll be able to calculate EV.
The shape of pmf is fundamentally an assumption. We can use of other assumptions to justify it, e.g. "after an attack some of the investors will understand that Bitcoin has significant weaknesses and the chances of its success are lower than before, thus these investors will divest; traders might anticipate this behavior and sell (or short) bitcoins".
In any case we need to decide on assumptions before a proof can be made.
This is how things work in general. When you start a new business, you make an assumption that a particular business model will be profitable. You don't know for sure, it cannot be "proven". Does it mean that starting a business is a gamble?
Metaphorically, yes, but labeling everything a gambling is not productive.

A typical Bitcoin transaction pays a fee on 2500-5000 satoshi scale. An extra 1000 satoshi to the software developers doesn't really make any difference. 
People lose _way_ more on rounding to 10000 satoshi many wallets implement (for no good reason, really, like "who cares about 5000 satoshi?" is the usual reasoning, I shit you not).

@_date: 2015-06-17 11:05:23
Uh what?
Miners (in the original sense, those who produce new blocks) need to process the contents of the block because they need to know which of the pending transactions are still valid. If the block they make has invalid transactions (e.g. their inputs are already spent), it will be rejected by other nodes/miners.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:02:05
Sending transactions without a fee is always like that, you never know when (and if) it will be confirmed.
Did you deliberately use zero fee or was it the default setting on the wallet?
In the later case it's absolutely unacceptable and you should complain to blockchain.info about it.
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:25:50


I don't think so.
1. 99+% miners' profits are from block subsidy, so they don't care that much about fees.
2. Inertia, bounded rationality: doing nothing is easier/cheaper.
3. Chicken &amp; egg: there is no incentive to develop a RBF-wallet when there is no support among miners, and there is no incentive for miners to adopt RBF policy when its there is no RBF transaction volume.
4. Miners are non-anonymous and might be afraid of backlash for facilitating double-spends.
All these things are not something you can depend on. Mining becomes more competitive (margins are smaller and smaller), miners become more savvy, more and more transactions are waiting in the mempool. As time goes we are likely to get into a situation where miner who is about to get out of business doesn't really care about Bitcoin anymore will just enable RBF for the hell of it.
RBF might be also enabled as a part of sophisticated attack. Imagine an attacker with significant amounts of capital. He might develop mobile wallet with RBF double-spending enabled (_BitBonus Wallet or something like that: each 10th purchase is free!_) and also buy a mining pool (or maybe just hashpower from [NiceHash]( to enable it. Then film a video of this mobile wallet being used to defraud merchants.
Once a proof video is posted, it becomes apparent that defrauding merchants which accept zero-conf payments has become easy and casual. People will start dumping Bitcoin, understanding that it cannot replace credit cards/cash. Which is something you can profit from by short-selling bitcoins beforehand.
So let's say an attacker has $1,000,000, spends $10,000 to develop an app, $100,000 to buy a mining pool, $10,000 to film a video. Short-sells bitcoins with 5x leverage and earns about $2,000,000.
Mike Hearn likes to say that zero-conf payments were safe enough for 5 years so they are likely to remain safe. But this is really ignorant and ignores the fact that the situation changes. The attack I described above makes no sense when the Bitcoin economy is tiny, as a cost of developing an app would eat all profits you could get from a tiny derivatives market.


It's better to have a crash before the Bitcoin economy is too big. Ideally we should have just a threat of RBF so there is a big incentive to develop instant-confirmation solutions, but no real harm until they are deployed. I think F2Pool deploying FSS RBF is a good thing: it shows that change is policy IS possible, but for now it does no real harm.
On the other hand Mike Hearn's position is harmful, as it instills a false sense of safety among payment processors and merchants. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:13:24

Bitcoin security relies on economic incentives and game theory. From Satoshi's paper:


assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
The reasoning like this can surely look like politics, but it is technical, as it is instrumental to Bitcoin's security.
This can be studied within the scientific framework, in fact there is an academic conference on this very subject: [The joint Workshop on Pricing and Incentives in Networks and Systems](
Do you think we should reject scientific analysis and instead rely on intuition?

You're confused. Fractional reserve is a different thing.
When a person deposits $1000 into a bank, bank is supposed to produce $1000 on demand. Obviously, that won't be a problem if bank kept $1000 in reserves. But if the reserve requirement is 10%, bank is allowed to keep only $100 in reserves, and lend $900 out.
The deposited amount is not bank's reserve, it is bank's liability, that is, bank is supposed to return that money after some time.
You can read more about fractional reserve banking here:

Yes. It is a trade-off. A sidechain with bigger blocks will be presumably easier to censor, but it's up to users to decide which qualities they see important. Generally it is good to have multiple options which represent different trade-offs.


That's the point.


Not mining the sidechain reduces your costs.
Also smaller pools can outsource sidechain block creation to bigger pools, while making Bitcoin blocks themselves. This will make sidechain inherently more centralized and less secure, but that's the whole point.

Here's a brief history of colored coins:
1. The idea appeared in 2012.
2. The first protocol implemented in 2012 was called OBC.
3. In 2013 we found that this protocol has several drawbacks and started designing other protocols.
4. In 2014 there were several groups working on colored coins, and each of them created a different protocol.
This fragmentation happened for several reasons: 1) people disagreed about features and didn't want to compromise; 2) each group wanted to commercialize it, so fast development was the priority.
So we ended up with three main protocol in 2014 (although quite possibly there are several more experimental or specialized ones):
1. EPOBC was implemented in NGCCC project, later known as ChromaWallet.
2. OpenAssets was implemented by CoinPrism.
3. CoinSpark.
Each protocol has its own advantages/disadvantages, but the idea is largely the same. They are all incompatible with each other.
So now in 2015 we have these three, and also Colu, which claims to have developed "the colored coins standard", but doesn't show it to anyone (wtf, Colu?).
In principle, colored coin wallets can implement more than one protocol. For example, ChromaWallet now has OBC and EPOBC and we can add any kind of a colored coin protocol. We considered adding OpenAssets, it's not hard on the tech level, but since we [do not like it]( it's not a priority, so to speak. Hope this helps.

Yes, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Bitcoin cannot reliably detect a network split. E.g. if a network containing 20% of total hashing power somehow ends up totally isolated from the rest, you will only observe that blocks are generated slower. But you can't tell whether it is a statistical anomaly or a network split.


Yes, also things like stock market (pink sheets, private equity, etc.), e-money, real estate trade, content licensing.
Using cryptography and replicated, highly-available audit trail will be a massive improvement over the current situation.

On the technical side, one benefit is a possibility of atomic transactions involving coins from multiple issuers. 
But, also, in general, check this: [Patterns of Integrity -- Separation of Duties](
In simple words, a centralized system will probably come with all sorts limitations.
E.g. as you probably know, people who accept PayPal are forced to use PayPal's dispute mediation, which is quite horrible (for merchants).
But for these colored coins, there is no such bundled 'feature'. Anybody can build his own dispute mediation service (e.g. using multi-sig scripts).

Well, after a single miner have broken it, it's already broken. So other miners can join, because by not accepting higher fees they only hurt themselves.
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:03:33


But it depends on fees. Higher fees encourage the use of offchain payment methods, reduce frequency of payouts, etc. Lower fees will prompt people to do transactions which they wouldn't otherwise make.
Without a consensus-level policy, we're likely to get into race-to-bottom kind of a situation.

I was commenting about the general principle that decisions should be based on research rather than simply on goals.
I'm not commenting on a specific argument, specific numbers or anything.
Everything can be modeled mathematically. For non-mining nodes, we can compute bandwidth requirements, number of non-mining nodes needed to support SPV clients and so on.
Sure, we can't just compute an optimal number of nodes, but we can tell if specific configurations are plausible.
E.g. if you say that 1000 nodes will be enough, but you want 1 billion of people to be able to use Bitcoin using thin clients... You expect that each node will serve 1 million clients. Is that realistic?

The default will affect Greek citizen too. Government will have to cut spending, so in the short term it will have same effect as austerity.
Greece still doesn't have a primary budget surplus (that is, even if they just ignore all the current debt, they are still spending more than they are earning), and as they won't be able to borrow money, they will have no option but to cut gov't spending even more.
And then people are talking introducing drachma back, which by design will be more inflationary than euro, so this is very much against bitcoiners' agenda.

Let's consider an example. Suppose 10 years for now people will push for 1 GB blocks, as we need to serve billions of users, etc.
Scientific analysis might suggest that with 1 GB blocks there will be a strong incentive to concentrate mining in one geographic area to minimize latency.
Suppose that despite this warning, proponents of 1 GB blocks will win. China has the majority of the mining power (this is the case now, in 2015), so Chinese miners build fast interconnects between their datacenters. Miners outside of China experience high orphan rates, and eventually all the mining is done in China.
Then Chinese government can infiltrate or seize mining operations and thus get a complete control over Bitcoin.
Is this scenario not plausible?
Sure, the actions of Chinese government cannot be predicted. However, the strong incentive to concentrate the mining in one geographic area can be predicted. And worst case negative consequences are obvious.
Abstraction is an essential feature of the scientific method. Even if we study a relatively simple phenomenon, like a body falling from height, there are myriads of factors: the body consists of billions of atoms, interacts with atoms of the medium, with all sorts of fields and so on. But that doesn't mean that formulating the law of gravitation is not useful, does it?
Note that I'm not saying that block size should be kept at 1 MB, I'm saying that dismissing what 'technical' people say is unwise. Sure, when a trade-off needs to be made, we need to decide on the goals, and this is a political rather than technical question.

You forget about transactional costs. One can got to a different bank, that's not a problem in principle; but in practice, the problem is that it's still a major inconvenience and can be somewhat time consuming and a person might suffer from inability to make payments for some time.
And also there is an informational asymmetry. When you're a consumer, it's very hard to compare banking services from different banks. I don't think that it is something which 'barriers to entry' can solve.

But if a miner is anonymous (and Bitcoin protocol allows that, in fact this is the default), then he cannot be penalized for RBF, moreover, it's impossible to tell whether miner helps double-spenders.
Then Mike claims that miners would not want to engage in a behavior which hurts Bitcoin because they have a vested interest. Well, we already tested it empirically, and it's not true: GHASH.IO was at about 50% of total hash power for several months, was screaming murder, but miners didn't care because GHASH gave them sightly more consistent payouts.
Miners are just some greedy assholes, it's a proven fact.
So now imagine you're an anonymous miner, and you know that other anonymous miners can at any time switch to a policy which hurts Bitcoin but increases their payouts, so why wouldn't you switch to it first and some extra cash by being first?
In reality miners do not enable RBF because it barely makes any difference in the current situation, not because they really care about Bitcoin or anything.
The important point here is that WE CANNOT DEPEND ON THIS. Mike says otherwise, he's clearly delusional.

First of all, blockchain.info can do that because it is connected to a lot of nodes and uses custom software. Normally orphaned blocks are not propagated through the network, so most nodes are not aware of them.
Second, the situation I'm talking about is _isolation_ of a part of a network. If different parts are communicating, then yes, they can just check whose chain is longer. But if they are unable to communicate, they cannot differentiate a split from a bad luck.

But we already have credit cards and PayPal, so I really see why do we need to turn Bitcoin into that kind of thing again.

Sidechain security substantially differs from Bitcoin security because the structure of economic incentives is very different:
1. If a sidechain is secured using merged mining, it can be attacked at no cost. 
2. Reward for attacking a sidechain is much bigger than a reward for attacking Bitcoin. E.g. if there is a sidechain which secures 1 million BTC it would be possible to steal that all in one go.
3. Negative consequences of attacking a sidechain is much smaller than negative effects of attacking Bitcoin. (You can steal the money but keep mining Bitcoin as usual.)
Thus sidechains are substantially less secure than Bitcoin, and can in fact undermine Bitcoin security. Your whitepaper doesn't have an in-depth analysis of possible attacks and doesn't cover economic incentives.


It is a federated system. Conceptually it is not different from Open Transactions voting pools. It is absolutely unrelated to sidechain security.

It can't be go on forever. If all these issues are resolved in a positive way, Bitcoin is likely to become gold 2.0, or world's reserve currency if not the global currency.

The peg is based on an ability to move money to/from a sidechain. I don't see how that can "hold them back", but they can stop it at any time using a soft fork. Minting new "bitcoins" within the sidechain would also break the peg, but that would require a hard fork and many users will be unhappy about it.
In general, initially Adam saw 2-way pegging as a mechanism for upgrading Bitcoin protocol in a safe manner, so basically when an upgrade is well-tested the old branch might be migrated into the new one completely. So this isn't out of question, I think. Although their current vision might be different.

As for the rest, you gotta figure it out yourself. It's not easy. After creating a transaction, it's probably easier to sign it with `bitcoin-cli signrawtransactions ...`.

There is nothing inherently Bitcoin-y about BitId.
It uses same ECDSA curve as Bitcoin (secp256k1), which makes it easy to implement in a Bitcoin wallet. But this curve isn't an unique Bitcoin feature, it pre-dates Bitcoin, and most alt-coins use the same curve.

In my opinion, things are scary when they system is not in the state of equilibrium. This means that it can collapse at any time.
When the system gets into the state of equilibrium, it's much less scary. It basically has nowhere to collapse to, as there is a strong force to bring it back to the state of equilibrium.
So in case of Bitcoin, RBF is an equilibrium state and non-RBF is a metastable state. Why? Because it takes a single miner to break it. Other miners will follow.

If all nodes your node have connected to are controlled by the attacker, he will be able to serve you his own chain instead of the main chain. So it makes difference.
E.g. if attacker controls 99% of all nodes and you connect to 8 random ones, probability that he pwns you is 92%.
Of course, he also needs some hashpower to do a double-spend, but much less than 50%.

Supermajority of hashing power. It has nothing to do with the network.
If a major bank will be willing to spend billions of dollars on mining equipment, they can easily change Bitcoin however they want.
This is why it doesn't work this way, Bitcoin represents a consensus among _users_, not nodes or miners. Miners simply automate the consensus.
Also note that it's enough to get 51% of the total hashing power, as then you can do a 51% attack rejecting blocks produced by others, and thus you'll be producing 100% of all blocks. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:22:37


Why does that matter? Most of the mining is done on the big  mining farms nowadays, and owners of those farms do not care about public opinion, they do what's most profitable for them.
Miners are no longer just ordinary people, they are for-profit businesses.


There isn't a big incentive to do this: miners earn most of their profits from block subsidy.
Extra profit from RBF might happen only after RBF tools and wallets get adopted.
So we basically have inertia and chicken&amp;egg situation, and incentives are not big enough to change anything.

That's OK, the problem is meant to be solved after some time. E.g. you spend 1 day on computing the challenge, and other people ("attackers") will spend 100 days on solving it. The whole point is that the speed with which they can solve it is bounded.


In the older scheme described by Peter Todd, the person who is interested to setup a timelock (e.g. an exchange operator) is supposed to do that, as he is interested in timelock functionality.

@_date: 2015-06-09 21:19:58


From another person. Well right now it is a limited (alpha) test involving mostly bank employees, so very few people can actually do something useful with Cuber.


The app won't be able to pull money directly the bank account for security reasons: stolen phone can result in the bank account emptied, which is not good. Instead users should treat Cuber as a separate account, and they will be able to move money from their main account to Cuber via the banking app.
In general the idea of Cuber is that it should work like cash: the user is responsible for securing it, transactions are irreversible, anybody can own it without opening an account. Of course, it also works online, so it is a bit better than cash. :)
At least this is the case we are exploring now, perhaps in future we'll also try different directions as well.

Pretty much everywhere in science they don't really have overarching models which explain absolutely everything. Instead, they make certain assumptions and simplifications to distill the phenomenon down to its core in order to study it analytically.
For example, some branches of physics study rigid body dynamics. Other branch studies deformations. And then there are fields, quantum effects, etc.
And then people use models which are the most appropriate for their goals. E.g. if you just need to check whether a train will arrive on schedule, you can model it as a point particle. But if you're a person in charge of designing a train, you need to use much more complex models.
So the root problem is the disagreement about the goals. It is as if Gavin wants to see how Bitcoin moves forward as a rigid body, while the opposing devs want to study its deformations. Being analytical won't help much.  Even if you're rigorous, people might claim that your model is flawed.

Having even a single fork once in a while weakens the network.


Well, this is how Bitcoin works in general: developers do not control what code users run, they can only recommend a particular version. So, in principle, users can change anything, but they understand that doing so isn't wise, as it will likely just hurt them.
You will see the effect only if a vast majority of nodes will change at the same time... And the best way to do it is to add the switch code to the software and convince people to run this version.
So again, changing the limit is not a problem, convincing everybody to change this parameter in a certain way at a certain time is.

The difference from regular bitcoins is that the issuer will have to pick the side, and users will have to follow (if the value of coins depend on the issuer).
There can be a problem if the issuer changes his side (e.g. the fork he was betting on is later defeated), or if there is a dispute between the users and the issuer. (I guess in a case of a legal dispute the court will have to decide which one is _the_ Bitcoin blockchain.)
For Cuber specifically it is much less of an issue because we use an interactive payment protocol and can, in principle, prevent the problems before they arise.

No, it doesn't. If fewer people use it, that is, demand for the currency decreases, the central bank can simply absorb excess liquidity.
It's more about a balance between inflation and economic growth. An economy can grow faster when the central bank gives more loans. (Usually it gives money to banks which then have resources to offer loans to enterprises which need money to expand, thus promoting growth.) But this causes inflation.
Earlier this year there was a massive euro devaluation, it happened because ECB announced measures to promote growth and alleviate problems caused by excessive debt of some eurozone countries.
There might be some indirect effect: Greece goes further into crisis -&gt; buys fewer goods -&gt; other EU countries get less revenues -&gt; ECB has to print more euro to help them.

F2pool is a pool, as the name suggest, not an owner of mining farms. So they care about reputation, while other participants might not.

Uh, what? If miners who have 10% of the total hashpower supports full RBF, then double-spend have ~10% success rate. Imagine getting one of 10 things you buy for free, that's not bad, is it? 100% success rate is not required.

If government is willing to enforce capital controls, there will be no scalable solutions, by definition.
People can still use workarounds, smuggling and whatnot. And, you know, one of the reasons of the current crisis is that Greece had a huge shadow economy where people did business using cash, paying no taxes. So somehow I think if they really want bitcoins, they will be able to acquire them.
In a shadow economy, Bitcoin can be complimentary to cash. For example, if you sell online services, you can receive Bitcoin payments from abroad, but obviously not cash.

You're wrong, there won't be some kind of a catastrophic event when the limit is reached.
First of all, as you can [see here]( Bitcoin usage is not constant, it is oscillating, that is, there are peak and off-peak hours. So what will happen is that more and more transactions will only be confirmed during off-peak hours.
Another thing is that many transactions are automatic payouts or withdrawals. If fees will become larger, people will just reduce their frequency, which will alleviate the pressure.
Of course, at some point high fees and high confirmation times will start pissing people off and they will switch either to other coins or to fiat.
As for the Gavin's approach, I think a more reasonable approach would be to raise limit to 2 MB in 2016, 3 MB in 2017 and so on. It still provides a room for growth, but is less scary than allowing 20 MB straight away.

Many of world's governments clarified how they see Bitcoin, whether they allow it to be used for payments, how it is taxed and so on. Additionally, some governments issued requirements for Bitcoin money transmitter businesses such as exchanges.
Several large companies (Dell, Microsoft, Overstock) started accepting Bitcoin, in addition to thousands of smaller merchants.
Bitcoin wallet companies, such as Coinbase, report that they have million of users.
Bitcoin startups received something on a scale of a billion dollars in VC funding, which ensures further growth of the ecosystem. Some of these companies employ Bitcoin core developers, which means the protocol itself and its core software will get some development to accommodate future growth.
Bitcoin received a lot of attention from academia, and there is plenty of research and practical improvement proposals. All Bitcoin experts believe that scaling Bitcoin is possible, they just disagree about a particular path.

Suppose miners who have powerful systems and fast network connections create a sidechain with 1 GB blocks. It won't be as decentralized as Bitcoin, of course, as many people will be left out, but at least people can use SPV wallets. And those people who want best security can keep using Bitcoin.
So sidechains can be used for scaling. I don't care what they are for, they can be used for scaling.
Also they might add features which enable off-chain payments, e.g. those which are necessary for Lightning network. That again can be used for scaling.

It is still uncertain, but the degree of uncertainty have changed a lot. There is no such thing as a complete certainty (unless we're talking about mathematical facts), so what matters is a degree.
Since 2009 Bitcoin went from a cypherpunk pipe dream to a pretty established, but still niche instrument. People no longer see bitcoins as some imaginary tokens which they use just for shits and giggles, for many people Bitcoin is money: they receive their wages in bitcoins, they use bitcoins to make payments and so on. And as we have many companies accepting bitcoins just like any other payment methods.
This is a tremendous change in the degree of certainty, which is reflected in the price. You can't deny that. Any metric you can take will reflect this. Unless you're a crazy person who believes that certainty is boolean, you just need to accept it as a fact.


This is a wishy-washy statement not backed by actual metrics. Yes, sure, way more people trust credit cards or cash way more than they trust Bitcoin, but the number of people who trust Bitcoin is pretty significant and growing.


Yes, who says otherwise? But we are also far from where we were in 2011. Don't you think there are points between 0 and critical mass?


Sure we don't have a complete certainty here, but most of this companies will benefit from wider adoption, and they have millions to spend on marketing and whatnot.

No, they don't. 
What matters is the amount of time it takes to verify a freshly mined block. If miners synchronized their mempool contents and use a deterministic block-building algorithm, this time can be O(1), that is, independent of block size.
But there is a problem: if there is a cartel of miners who are able to verify each others' blocks quickly, and it has the majority of hashpower, they can tramp miners who do not belong to the cartel by mining blocks which are hard to verify by outsiders.

No. 51% attack is usually not in miners' interest, as it will undermine the trust in Bitcoin and thus will drastically reduce their revenues.
Fast block verification is not an attack, it is an optimization miners can use. And it requires no trust: a misbehaving miners can be disconnected from the system without much damage.
51% double spending requires upfront planning and trust among the participants, structurally it is a very different thing.

People who are more familiar with Lightning than I am, can you explain how will this scenario work:
 * Alice has a channel with GW, and she uses it to send money to Bob
 * Bob's balance was previously 0, he didn't have any bitcoins anywhere
 * now he has an output going to him in a HTLC, so he can materialize his bitcoins now by publishing a transaction which reveals his preimage
 * but suppose he doesn't want to (as the fee will be large), instead he wants to pay to Claire
Now what? He cannot use the same process which normal users (e.g. Alice) can do, because he doesn't own any bitcoins before he materializes the payment, so he cannot open the channel, etc.

I don't think there is a strong correlation between merchant adoption and price. There is no direct causal relationship either: if anything, higher adoptions means that more bitcoins are sold, which create a downward pressure on price.
If the price is what we care about, what matters is whether people want to buy bitcoins, and whether they want to hold them as an investment.
Consumer adoption is largely irrelevant here. Why would a person who receives salary in USD buy bitcoins only to spend them in stores? This just makes no sense, no sane person will do that. At least not in developed countries where credit cards work quite well.
Bitcoin makes sense for things like remittance, international trade, settlements, etc. But these use cases alone won't drive price upwards as much as we won't.
In reality the price is mostly driven by investors. As soon as investors will be certain that Bitcoin (rather than some other cryptocurrency) will play a big role in future, they will start buying it. Investors look at adoption, but it is just one of factors they consider.

If in future sidechains will be a clearly better solution, then yes, sure. But

So this is not something we're betting on.

It's a completely unrelated thing. A central bank (the Fed in the case with US) can create as much money as it wants to. And then it can be lent out many times.
Imagine USA created 1 trillion dollars and bought 1 trillion dollars worth of goods from China. Then China has 1 trillion dollars. USA borrows 1 trillion dollars from China and buys more goods again. Now China has both 1 trillion dollars (cash) and 1 trillion dollars worth of bonds. It can lend money to USA again. The process can continue many times, so the total debt might exceed the amount of money circulating in the system. This is known as a 'multiplier'.
Note that it works even without banks/deposits. Banks work in a similar way acting as an intermediary between borrowers and depositors. The money which is lent out is spent (e.g. person buys a house) and the counterparty usually deposits it bank into the bank. In principle, the process can repeat ad infinitum so 1 dollar could create trillions worth of debt. In practice the multiplier is usually within 10-100 range.

Do you say the same thing about people who design ciphers and cryptographic protocols?
One man's theoretical attack is another man's practical attack. When people design ciphers, they take into account things which are barely plausible.
When they don't, bad things happen. SSL/TLS, the protocols which secure e-commerce and online banking, [had dozens]( of practical vulnerabilities. Apparently the cerebral types who designed these protocols were not imaginative enough.
And cryptocurrencies are both cryptographic protocols and decentralized systems at the same time, and they are secured by economic incentives, so they are vulnerable to much wider range of attacks.
So... let's ignore people who have been developing Bitcoin for years. They have too little experience in implementation.

The Bitcoin blockchain is secured through mining. In the long term, miners will earn money only from transaction fees.
If we try to quantify the security level, we'll see that it is more-or-less proportional to fees miners collect (as this is the opportunity cost of an attack, basically), so it is crucial that we have many transactions paying good fees.
If sidechains offer advantages over Bitcoin, most of transactions will be done on sidechains, and thus the revenues of pure Bitcoin miners will dwindle.
So miners will have to mine both Bitcoin and sidechains if they don't want to go out of business. This is possible via merged mining.
Now the problem is, the way merged mining works now, each chain can be attacked independently. So suppose that miners get 95% of their revenues from sidechains and 5% of their revenue on Bitcoin. If they choose to attack Bitcoin, they are losing only 5% of their revenue if the attack is unsuccessful. Thus in a low-volume high-value state Bitcoin will be very vulnerable to double-spending attacks.
It might be possible to implement merged mining in such a way that this attack is impossible. But still, you know, if the overwhelming amount of commerce is happening on sidechains, the role of Bitcoin's main chain will be reduced. E.g. merchants will stop accepting real bitcoins and so on.

[Tragedy of the commons]( is a well-known issue and a real problem. Overgrazing. Overfishing. There are hundreds of examples.
Thinking that Bitcoin mining is different is incredibly naive.
Overfishing doesn't happen on fish farms where the owner has control over fish population. The problem happens when resource is in a shared control. Each individual fisherman knows that overfishing is bad, but if he stops fishing, other fishermen will catch more this year, so this way he only reduces his own profit, but doesn't solve the long-term problem.


Bitcoin should work well when all miners are rational, that's the main idea. From Satoshi's paper:


assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
Bitcoin doesn't have fundamental problems in this regard, aside from 0-conf transactions.

1. Stop giving banks new loans. Many of these loans are short-term, so banks will have to return the money rather soon.
2. Increase the interest rate on the loans they give out. Banks will be reluctant to borrow money from ECB and will have to stop giving loans to businesses or charge higher interest rate. This will affect M1 money supply (which depends on the total amount of loans given by banks) but not MB (the central bank money).
3. Sell bonds which they currently hold. This will have a direct effect on MB.
4. Increase reserve requirements for banks. Banks will have to reserve more, so they'll be able to give out fewer loans, which will decrease practically significant M1 money supply.
Physical euro are only a tiny part of the total supply.
Previously ECB was quite successful at keeping inflation rate at around 2% target, but EU decided that keeping euro value stable is no longer important.

There are several factors at work here.
1. If we consider a simplified model where blocks are propagated instantly and the attacker has less than 50% of total hashpower, a security against double-spends depend on the number of confirmations, and thus shorter intervals are beneficial.
2. However, if block propagation delay is non-zero, an attacker who is close to 50% can get an additional boost, thus it is easier to pull off 51% double-spend attack.
Thus it is a trade-off: reducing block interval improves one thing, but makes another thing worse. There should be a sweet spot somewhere.
E.g. suppose that with 10 minute interval and the current block size limit (and sync algorithm) a global orphan rate is around 1%. This means that in principle an attacker who owns 49% of all hashpower might overpower the network.
If we reduce the interval to 5 minutes, the orphan rate goes to 2% and now an attacker with 48% of the total hashpower can overpower the network.
But if a merchant ships the goods after 3 confirmations in the first case, he might wait for 6 confirmations in the second case. This reduces risk of double-spend from 10% to 1% for an attacker with 47% of an apparent hashpower.
Thus reducing the block interval improves protection against an attacker wiht 47% of total hashpower, but makes it more vulnerable to an attacker with 48% of total hashpower. Shit's complex.

Something like this [was initially described by Mike Hearn]( it is quite compatible with the first colored coin protocol (OBC), as well as its successors (e.g. EPOBC).
But you need an additional step, you need a proof that GM created that transaction output, as anybody can put a car serial into an OP_RETURN. This can be accomplished in two ways:
1. genesis transaction hash is hard-coded into car's smart property chip
2. car's smart property chip has issuer's public key, and transaction hash is signed by it


New owner can send a chain of transactions and block headers to the car's chip. This chip will implement the same logic as thin wallets to validate this information. After that it will know new owner's public key, and thus will be able to validate messages signed by owner's key.

If so, it's not just the assets a client receives, but all the assets that were mixed into previous transactions, which seems like a larger scope than those, which may have interacted with via swaps?
Yes. I meant "interacted with" in transitive sense.

Trading engine is not the part of the coloring layer, so it can be based on ANY technology. You can literally use IRC for communication layer.
The important part is that trade is still trustless, regardless of the communication technology being used.


Yes, it is a very different approach, that's the whole point. But trades are still trustless, and I think that's all users care about.


Lack of atomic swap transactions is the fundamental difference. In case with colored coins, it doesn't matter what technology is used for communication. Whatever you use, in the end there will be a signed transactions signed by both parties, and it is atomic: 
If you trade Counterparty assets over ZeroMQ (whatever it means) it won't be trustless, i.e. one party can end up stealing assets. Counterparty fundamentally lacks this capabilities because it is based on a different ideas.


Doing Counterparty double-spends is MUCH easier than doing Bitcoin double-spends. Bitcoin nodes mempool rules do not protect against Counterparty double-spends because they are not aware of Counterparty transaction dependencies.

Look, I'm not a marketing person trying to push a specific protocol. And you do not seem to understand the value of security analysis.
E.g. when people write about topics like _Preimages for step-reduced SHA-2_, do you think they are just spreading FUD to promote a competing product? What could be their motivation?
When people discuss ordinary software, usually they focus on features, usability and performance. But for security software and protocols, the focus is usually on security, i.e. what kind of attacks it is secure against, and other features are secondary to that.
As you might know, cryptanalysis focuses on negative aspects, e.g. such and such algorithm is weak against such and such attack. Security protocol analysis is also done in this style, i.e. in order to gauge protocol security people try to identify its flaws. 
OpenAssets is not the only protocol I wrote articles about. In [Cryptocurrencies without Proof of Work]( we described Peercoin problems, and in [the proof-of-activity paper]( we described issues with Bitcoin protocol itself. That doesn't mean that we have an alt-coin to sell, it is just the research we did, and we have honestly described our findings.


Our software is designed to support  multiple protocol from the start, we can add any colored coin protocol in matter of days because the "color kernel" part is fully encapsulated from the rest. So it's not like we have a need to promote a single protocol.
I just believe that OpenAssets is a bad protocol, and "installed base" doesn't really mean much. Ripple had an installed base before Mastercoin was released, Mastercoin had an installed base before Counterparty was released, Counterparty had an installed based before OpenAssets was released an so on. US dollar had a huge installed base when Bitcoin was released. :)

Inability to distinguish different batches can be a problem, though, as freshly issued coins can be instantly sold on an exchange. So a private key leak might be disastrous, while with other protocols it's just an annoyance.

Counterparty requires one to submit orders to the blockchain, which means that trader has to pay a fee for every order he submits (and also for every canceled order).
With colored coins, negotiations can take place via any communication channel (e.g. IRC, email, p2p network), only the final transaction needs to be posted on the blockchain. 
Also a transaction can be considered executed as soon as it is propagated on the Bitcoin network, one doesn't need to wait a block confirmation to see that it is executed. Of course, it is still potentially reversible before it is confirmed, but in practice we see that Bitcoin miners honor mempool rules, and thus one can get 99% certainty within seconds, not minutes.
Also there is a difference when Bitcoin is used as a currency: Counterparty requires a really clumsy two-step process which requires at minimum two Bitcoin blocks; apparently it was so bad that they disabled it in Counterwallet. So Bitcoin is a second-class citizen in Counterparty, but color coin-based systems can use it as a currency without any problem.
Finally, colored coins are compatible with payment channel, thus in principle it is possible to do thousands of transactions per second without paying any fees.

You're missing the fact that the issuer is an adversary in this situation.
The whole point of colored coins is that in case of a dispute, user has an unambiguous and irrefutable proof, which is fully independent from issuer, and can then remand remedy from a third party or via the legal system.
If you do not consider situation where there is a dispute between the user and the issuer, why even both using colored coins? If issuer is the trusted party, he could just keep the ledger on his server.
Let's consider a situation where the issuer offers insured bonds: if he defaults on his obligations, insurance company pays compensation to bondholders.
So, suppose 1000 $1 bonds were issued, and a year later the issuer defaults. So the bondholders, having the proof that they bought these bonds come to the insurance company. But the insurance company finds that 1,000,000,000 bonds now exist on the blockchain. The contract they have covers only 1000 bonds. What can they do with it?
You seem to assume that there is a single "issuer" entity which is responsible for everything, but in practice, multiple entities are involved
 * operator who issued coins
 * company which employs him
 * company which handles redemption
The whole point of colored coins was to allow a separation of duties, so that, for example, a guy who issued coins (i.e. was has a physical control of the computer which was issued during issuance) could not interfere with redemption process.

Maybe. I believe that scalability can be improved using sidechains or _something like sidechains_.
We can keep Bitcoin block size at 1 MB, but use one or more sidechains with bigger blocks. Or maybe faster blocks. There is a paper called [Accelerating Bitcoin’s Transaction Processing]( which describes a protocol called GHOST:


its main data structure, the blockchain, that immensely improves security from attackers,
especially when the network operates at high rates. This improvement allows for further
increases in the number of transactions processed per second. ... The block generation rate can be securely increased to more than one block per
second – a 600 fold speedup compared to today’s rate, while still allowing the network to
processes many transactions per second.
Of course, implementing GHOST on the main chain will be very controversial, but a sidechain doesn't need to be kept up to the same standard.
Thus we might end up with a high-security high-decentralization main Bitcoin chain which will be used for things like keeping savings, larger settlements and so on. And one or more fast sidechains which might be not as decentralized, but much faster and cheaper to use.

Yes. 
We could require miners to add a hash of several UTXO set elements chosen using pseudorandom function depending on block header contents. Miner  will need to have up-to-date UTXO set to produce them, fetching them from a 3rd party is inefficient due to delay.
Miner will have to process the block to update UTXO set which is necessary to mine a valid block. He might skip signature check, though.
But I think miners will be more aware of the risks after this incident, and after you take risks into account it's just not worth it. So there is an incentive to do mining properly.

Well, the original Bitcoin paper makes an example with 6 confirmations. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:03:52


No. UTXO selection should depend on everything except nonce, so you have to compute it once per 4 billion hashes.
That can be expensive enough so that a miner will have a dedicated machine constantantly churning UTXO hashes. This doesn't change the essence of mining (one $1000 machine serving a $100k mining farm), but it will discourage "sharing" (there is no sharing because a new UTXO hash should be computed for each unit of work).
Also there is a latency and bandwidth issue. You have to continuously receive new block templates and you can't mine without them.
So in the end it is just cheaper and better to do it properly.
@_date: 2015-07-04 11:05:41


In case with "SPV mining" the opposite is true: if your profit depends on fees, you actually need to process block contents before starting mining a new block.
There might be other kinds of cheating, though.
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:16:43
In the context of the current debate, we need it to avoid discouraging decentralization.
That is suppose different miners have different bandwidth and computation capabilities (aside from different hashpower).
WIthout a block size limit, miners who have larger capacities can attack miners with smaller capacities by making huge blocks those smaller miners won't be able to process in a reasonable time.
It has other useful functions too, e.g. making sure that running a full node is feasible for end users and so on.
The important part is that saying that "limit is not required" is meaningless. The statement should be of form "the limit is not required for X because X is satisfied anyway (or can be satisfied by other means)".

@_date: 2015-07-05 16:53:44


I gotta agree with Gregory on this. You do not even state your assumptions clearly. So let's consider two different models:
\1. Suppose miners are identical, i.e. have identical and finite networking and verification capacities. In this case these capacities define the capacity of the network as a whole. There are no formulas to write, it follows directly from assumptions.
E.g. you assume "it takes on average 15 seconds to verify 1 MB of typical transactional data". Then the maximum network capacity is `600/15 = 40 MB per 10 minutes`. QED. You don't need no fancy math here. It looks like you have a tighter bound, but that 10 MB bound depends on several additional assumptions and is not very useful. (E.g. you aren't taking into account the fact that 0 byte blocks make no sense whatsoever when block subsidy is zero.)
\2. Suppose miners have different network bandwidth capacity and/or different verification capabilities. Then if we increase block size some of the miners will reach their limit faster than other miners.
And the whole point of having a block size limit is to make sure that "big miner" cannot drive "small miners" out of existence by making larger block. Then your statement: "Evidence of an effective blocksize limit: no protocol-enforced limit required" is obviously false, we don't need any formulas to prove that.
It looks like instead of formulating the problem properly you started with an idea of solution, and wrote that solution without even bothering to write down what exactly you're solving. Again, if you assume that miners have finite capacities, then the whole network has a finite capacity as well, it is a trivial fact.
Can you just admit that it was a brainfart and move on?
If it was me, I'd even apologize for posting bad material, as this wastes everyone's time.
And for the record, I am not in any way related to Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-07-06 10:40:00


No they don't. They temporarily resort to SPV mining while they wait for a block to be verified. Once it is verified, they do mining as usual.
SPV mining is a bad thing, it undermines SPV wallet security, without which we can't achieve scalability. Block size limit reduces the time it takes to verify a block, and thus it reduces time miners spend on "SPV mining", and thus it is a good thing for Bitcoin security.
Without block size limit the following scenario is possible:
1. attacker produces a large invalid block
2. it takes a lot of time to validate it, so most miners will resort to "SPV mining" 
3. chances are that one or more blocks will be added on top of it
4. attacker might now trick SPV wallets into accepting double-spends or even completely fake money


The attack is profitable as long as the expected profit is higher than the block subsidy, i.e. 25 BTC. 


You don't need 51% to perform this kind of an attack.


It doesn't look like you understand how it works.

No, it won't be enough. There is a direct link between a block reward and double-spend incentive.
Basically, if fees are shit, miners would rather double-spend. E.g. suppose that the expected value of reward is 0.01 BTC but an expected value of a double-spend profit is 1 BTC, what would miner choose?
There is a misunderstanding of what block rewards are for. We aren't paying for doing certain amounts of hashing or transaction verification. We pay miners so that they have an incentive to be good guys. 
Here's the quote from Satoshi's paper:
