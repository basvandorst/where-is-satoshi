So the only option is to buy or make a farm...
Buy like 0,000001 bitcoin and sell it the next day? 
How does that work?
Do you have someone wich converts bitcoins to € ?
How drastically bitcoins change? Is like today is 4000€ 
Tomorow can be 200€ ??

I mean that the miner can break...
If it get's broken the first 2 days i got it? I won't get the money back...

I don't know... if that thing can mine a single bitcoin 
Im happy
Because 1 bitcoin is nearly 4000€ that's A LOT of money...

Im pretty stupid and i can't make money on my own i work at a restaurant and they pay me 600€/month
And my rent is 500€...
It's pretty evident that i can't make money...
Any € is important so if the miner will make 20€/month and won't break in 10 years maybe yes... i wold buy it...

I found an app
Bitcoin.com 
I have the wallet 
And i can convert € to bitcoin i think...
But i can't find the button that makes
Bitcoin to €
I use that because it says bitcoin.com
Everywhere i find advertisment to wachout with scam and hacks and fake sites...
So coinbase is legit?
What about 
 ???

Just a quick search and found one ...." near" me
But it's
Fees: Buy 6%, Sell 4%
Where can you exchange bitcoins for € ??? 
These atm's are the only thing that can make it?

Oh and also...
I've seen somewhere around Reddit someone saying that mining bitcoin is a hobby, you shouldn't start mining if you want money... what about that?
