Thanks for the answer, I need a website where I can withdraw large amount of cash if needed. Do you have any idea which website would suit me the best

Yea I had an account on kraken but I stopped using it cause having my bitcoins on there is scary when they can't even properly run there website.

The reason I posted this, is because I wanna show that I trust Bitcoin even though its going through a chain hijack. Bitcoin will only get stronger out of this even if this means it will crash temporarily.

I agree. But it was to transfer fast. Do you know if Blockchain can actually help you if you do know the wallet adress and password

How do I dump it safely from my ledger, like make sure I dont get my BCH and BTC mixed can I just send it from the BCH chain, my BCH is  still in the 'main' wallet.
