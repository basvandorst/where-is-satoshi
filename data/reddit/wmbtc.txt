I believe that webmoney will have to show their BTC wallet , so that hey will have trust, other wise they can become like the FED with their Fiat,  webmoney with wmx ..
where the gold is BTC and the fiat is  wmx.
@_date: 2013-07-27 11:52:58
The Russians that consider BTC a ponzi sheme are people who dont have anything to do on the web or just "didnt get it " and some probobly will never "get it" . 
 But the ones which do business on the web like , websmaters , SEO , design , hacking , carding and so on ... GET IT just for a simple reason, the  payment on the runet webmoney.ru is accepting Bitcoin !!! and people that dont "get it" should ask them selfs, would a giant like webmoney accept a ponzi sheme ??
PS: ofcourse many didnt had to wait for webmoney to become a bitcoiner,  and beccome bitcoiners them selfs )
