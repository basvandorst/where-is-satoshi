I'm not sure at this point if its a matter to coding or developing code, as there are few lines of code involved in this update and Gavin has already conducted lots of testing. 
It seems more a question of building consensus among the major mining pools and other node operators. This issue seems to be coming to a head and bringing out lots of proposals. 
The Chinese mining pools just offered 8 MB or BIP 100 as solution they are comfortable with.

So examples could be simple things such as the bitcoin price data stream, message steams from bit message, or more complex APIs such as the multi wallet API above.
One way to think about it is today's internet has to run on the old rails of payment networks such as Visa for every single paid application that runs on the web. So just by removing the friction in payment for API from the marketplace every programmer ends up with at least 3% more money in his pocket or his application can cost less. On top of that this creates a scenario where API providers have to compete and that will drive down prices even more.
Or I remember early on with Twitter it had a ton of little apps that would do all kinds of things with their own cool interfaces. That died off because the Twitter API is unreliable and since the API is free Twitter didn't want to offer Apps much access. With this new model developers could use as much data as they want from the market, and the API provider has a reason to make their service provide more data instead of less.

I'm pretty proud of this document.
So for context, if you note the date, (March 4th 2014) this is right before the first Texas Bitcoin Conference was held. The price of bitcoin was down from the previous months and some of the sponsors of the conference were flaking out due to the price change. The conference was in need of BTC in order to move forward successfully.
The conference organizers reached out to me, Sam and Brock. They asked for sponsorship and for us to invest $140,000 into the conference so it could go forward. We believe in the organizers of the conference (Paul, Steven, Raphael and all those volunteering to make it happen) and wanted to see it be successful and thus agreed to help.
We got 14% of the equity between the three of us (Sam, Brock and myself) in exchange for $140,000 and a few sponsorship spots for that and future conferences (I gave a sponsor spot to BitAngels, but the BitAngels as a group were not involved in the investment) this was a personal investment for me.
The conference went forward and had 700+ attendees, great speeches, and produced great technical talks, which were all recorded and shared with the broader Bitcoin community.
So yes, Brock, Sam and I stood up and helped out a community run event when others sponsors were flaking out. And I'd do it again.

Yes. So for example Bank of America got a huge fine 9.3 Billion for basically losing track of who owned which mortgages and then trying to back date that information.
So with Factom, Bank of America could time stamp mortgages (with the hash of the doc) into the blockchain and then update the doc each time a payment was made, then both BOA and the mortgage holder can verify those records forever, with out having to trust either BOA or the mortgage holder. 
The blockchain becomes the third party ledger for securing any financial system. Its the culmination of the blockchain technology fixing today's broken banking system : )
Its also worth noting that when we talk about hashing a "document" we are using the computer science version of the word, where a "document" could be any digital file including a program, a photo, a video, a block of text. Meaning this system can be used generally to extend the security of the blockchain to any other application.

**Links for the project:**

Crowdsale Website: 
Whitepaper: 
**Short Summary of the Project:**
A marketplace where API providers compete on price and thus API providers can monetize their API as a service.
An open standard so anyone can add additional APIs to the interface that people want support for.
An open source view into how all the data is handled so that you can customize it for your application if you need a more powerful solution.
**Problems the system is solving:** 
There are four central issues with today's providers of API calls:
Many of the most popular API's you can think of (Facebook, Twitter, Salesforce) have artificial limits on the number of API calls a developer can make to their system. This creates critical scaling issues and often breaks smaller applications that depend on these API calls when they reach these limits put in place by API providers.
Today, websites that provide a single interface for accessing multiple API's, there isn't any price competition for the API calls developers want to make and the central service takes a margin on top of its costs, so the price the developer (and his or her users) pay for convenience is a higher price per API call.
Singly.com as an example is a private centralized company, and so if it doesn't support the API you want, then its tough luck for you. Of course you can send in a request and maybe one day they will support it.
Lastly because these services are not open source, you can't see the back end of how their code is handling the data from the API to you. So you have a much simpler interface with less function possible.
**Example Use Case:**
Multi Wallet API - Build an API that allows a network of servers running specific token daemons to interface generically with wallets for -- at the minimum -- basic send/receive/balance functionality. Then developers can use an API instead of doing all the work themselves.

Hey Kyle. I think about this similar to the Bitcoin network. The increasing price of BTC does not make it more expensive for users to send value across the Bitcoin Network. Regardless of the price of BTC transaction fees are much lower than the traditional financial system because of the competition between miners to confirm transactions. So the more people use the system the more demand there is for the tokens. Since the tokens are limited in supply an increase in demand leads to an increase in value of the tokens. Thus a token will be able to buy more and more storage space over time.

I agree that the "Proof of whatever" is the hardest aspect of a token based project. There is a lot of vaporware floating around and some half baked projects. However I have to say, last week I got on a plane and flew to Scotland and met with the Maidsafe team in person. I came away very impressed. Time will tell how their system performs. But after spending 10 plus hours with their developers and seeing their system in action I don't have any technical concerns left.

So today you can add your document individually to the blockchain by hashing it and adding it in with a transaction.
With Factom you can add tons of hashes, and by consolidating them into a single block the user gets to secure many records with a single transaction into the blockchain. So for 10 or 100 times less costs you can get the same level of security as the blockchain.

So obviously this is an on going discussion in the Bitcoin community. Some say we don't need tokens and others are forging ahead with token based projects such as the ones you listed: Mastercoin, Bitshares, Ethereum, and many others. 
The reason I find that token based projects are flourishing is that the incentives are better aligned between users, developers, investors, and supporters of the project as we see with Bitcoin itself. 
In non-token based projects in my opinion there is a weaker alignment of incentives such as the one you pointed out "people are able to connect to you easily and so you can connect to others". That is a well and good benefit, however it only comes after the technology is built and the network is established. In the mean time the developers don't have funding or have to rely on donation based funding. Where as the token based projects have a market value day one based on the strength of their proposal, the core dev team and the demand from users.
As for the Hackathon I wouldn't discount the value of meeting many other passionate people who want to solve the same problem and might be happy to speak with you about mathematical papers. : )

- What do you see for bitcoin in 5 years?
**In 5 years I expect a billion people to be using Bitcoin. Most of them won't even know it. Anymore than billions of people understand they are using HTTP on a daily basis.**
- What advice would you give someone who wants to be more productive in the community/ecosystem of bitcoin but has no applicable skills or capital?
**If you don't have any capital or skills, I'd say you can help educate people about the benefits of Bitcoin. With that said I'd recommend developing skills based on what ever your passions are and leveraging them to adding value to the community.**

That's a pretty good summary. It's worth highlighting that Factom solves the bloat problem, by needing only a SINGLE hash / transaction into the blockchain (every 10 minutes) to secure an unlimited number of hashes / transactions in a Factom block.
So for example an exchange could be recording hundreds of transactions each minute, all those transactions go into a Factom block. The block is hashed and that single hash goes into the blockchain.

Yes, its an open system. You could create your own Factom Chain with its own set of rules defined in the first block. Its important to understand you can secure these hashes privately (hash of a non-public document) and use them as a "relieved secret" to prove something in the future.
You could run it on your own server privately and dump the hashes into the blockchain. 
Though you get cost efficiencies by leveraging the distributed pools of servers that audit Factom blocks in real time and get incentivized by the protocol to do so. 
You also get more real time security if you have multiple servers auditing the blocks, instead of a single point of failure in a single server.

So you need SAFE coins to buy more storage space on the SAFE Network (to host a website or store a video file lets say). As long as the demand for more storage on the SAFE Network outpaces the falling price of disk storage, the price of SAFEcoins will go up over time, provided more people are getting utility from the network.

**4. This will educate all congressman and senators staff members on BTC as they will have to set up accounts to scan the paper wallet into Coinbase or Blockchain.**
**5. And oh Senator Joe Manchin, "Captin Ban Bitcoin" (we haven't forgotten about him), ya we can donate to who ever runs against that guy.**
Here is the text from the Bit PAC letter. Here is the link to donate. 
* item 1.
"There is no surer path to the broad acceptance of Bitcoins as a fully legitimate currency, free of unreasonable government regulation, than aligning the interests of Bitcoin users with those of politicians.” - Dan Backer
* item 2.
With your support, we can achieve our goal of making Bitcoin a familiar currency in politics.  BitPAC accepts contributions in Bitcoin – or US Dollars to purchase them - and ONLY contributes in Bitcoin to lawmakers – making Bitcoin tangible to them.
* item 3. 
Our first challenge – make a wave of contributions to every sitting Senator &amp; Representative up for re-election in 2014 – a stunning &amp; public exposure of Congress to Bitcoin. 
* item 4.
Your contribution of $5, $50, or $500 will protect the future of Bitcoin as we strive to make $15,000 in Bitcoin contributions in this first wave – small contributions to most and a few larger bipartisan contributions to key legislators. 
* item 5.
We cannot achieve this ambitious goal without your immediate support and that of the Bitcoin community.  Sign our petition to join the movement to allow Bitcoin to evolve and flourish by protecting Bitcoin from unnecessary government interference – and then contribute to the first Congressional “BitBomb.”
* item 6.
House and Senate Committees will soon draft Bitcoin related laws – and provide guidance to regulatory entities - these decisions will impact the Bitcoin community.  It is crucial that when they do, they’ve “touched” BitCoins. 
* item 7.
This is why we need YOU to act now and contribute $5, $50 or even $500 to BitPAC to drive this electoral and policy debate, and make sure those writing the rules for Bitcoin have benefited from Bitcoin! 
Dan Backer
* item 8.
P.S. We need the support of the Bitcoin Community to show Washington how serious we are.  Join our efforts by signing our petition and making a contribution of $5, $50, or $500 at Bit-PAC.com to help secure the future of Bitcoin.

So far in the United States crowd funding has been allowed. The recent Jobs Act even loosened up long time rules around publicly mentioning you are raising money. I hope that the regulators see that this type of innovation is positive and being done in a transparent and fair way. 
As for throwing the book at people its normally not at the investors supporting a project, but at an executive who did criminal things. I'm not looking to be CEO of any of these projects. And just like Bitcoin I don't expect these projects will have a CEO. They have to be open source after all.

There are a lot of cool projects working to bring BTC to the developing world. BitPagos is one of my favorite in South America.

@_date: 2014-03-03 23:24:33
Good question. So the idea is that I'm interested in projects that are using the "Bitcoin Model" of a Decentralized Application, but not competing with the features of Bitcoin. When most people say "alt-coin" they mean one of two things. Either an "alternative" to Bitcoin or a project that uses an "alternative blockchain". I'm not interested in projects that fit these definitions of an "alt-coin". 
Let me give an example of what I am interested in. If you came to me with a project and said "Its basically Dropbox, but people can pay in Bitcoins" I would have no interest because one day soon Dropbox will start taking BTC and your advantage disappears. But if you came to me with a project and said "This protocol pays people "Storage Coins" to contribute their extra hard drive space to a the cloud and we have a cool "Proof of Storage" mechanism and its all open source and we store the records in the Bitcoin blockchain." Then I'd be highly interested. Its the difference between simply accepting BTC and building a new technology using the Bitcoin / Decentralized Applications. Its not very easy to build these types of projects and its mostly for those building big infrastructure type projects (storage, compute, internet, browsing), but if it fits what you want to do its the most powerful model I've ever come upon.
P.S. Don't come to the hackathon ready to build this decentralized file storage idea : ) I'm already following four projects close to tackling this particular use case. That is unless you are looking for a job / co-founder and want to meet some of those projects. In case come on down and bring a friend.

The biggest take away for the end use is that the API Network will bring them many more cool applications that can't exist today because of the broken way the market for APIs works today.
Let me bring in Alice and Bob to explain.
**EXAMPLE WITHOUT API NETWORK**
Alice has an bitcoin to dogecoin exchange website. One of the features Alice offers is a price ticker from the trades being done on her order book. In theory Alice's price data feed is available as an API... somewhere, well maybe if you contact her directly and figure out how to use it.
Bob has a bitcoin and crypto currency charts website that shows real time prices for bitcoin and many other crypto currencies. Bob wants to add the price of of bitcoin to dogecoin to his website charts. Bob first has to survey the exchanges that trade bitcoin for dogecoin and find out who offers an API. Bob finds out that Alice offers the API he needs and reaches out to her. Bob connects with with Alice's API but it has many limits: only so many calls per hour can be made. So instead of real time data Bob's charts show a 20 minute delay.
Later on Charlie, Dan, and Ethan want to connect to Alice's API too. But Alice doesn't want to support all the calls to her server or go to the trouble of setting up a payment mechanism and decides to shut off this service. Now Bob, Charlie, Dan and Ethan must go find any other exchange offering an API for bitcoin to dogecoin trades.
**EXAMPLE WITH API NETWORK**
Alice has an bitcoin to dogecoin exchange website. One of the features Alice offers is a real time price ticker from the trades being done on her order book which she has listed on the API Network.
Bob has a bitcoin and crypto currency charts website that shows real time prices for bitcoin and many other crypto currencies. Bob wants to add the price of of bitcoin to dogecoin to his website charts. Bob goes to the API Network and finds that Alice offers the API he needs. Bob uses the API for free for a while and later decides to pay a little API Coin to Alice for real time data and more calls to her service.
Later on Charlie, Dan, and Ethan connect to Alice's API through the API Network. Alice's API service becomes popular and she gets paid lots of API Coins, some of which she converts into bitcoin and uses the money to sustain and improve her API service over time.

Basically yes. User layers will make Bitcoin easier and easier to use.  If you wanted email back in the early 1990's you had to know how to basically configure your own email server. Today you just push a button and fill out a basic form on Google and they do all the leg work to set up your account, import your contacts, and so forth.
With Bitcoin when I started I actually downloaded the Bitcoin client and ran it on my laptop. Now when my father creates a Bitcoin wallet I simply send him to Coinbase.com and he gets to use their great user interface to do all that sort of stuff automatically.

1. If you don't know they are true, then why bring up past allegations?
2. Brock has invested in dozens of bitcoin startups in the crypto space and so no I don't think its significant that two of the startups he has put some money into might be having issues. In addition, to my knowledge KNC miner has successfully delivered tens of millions of dollars of hardware to customers the last few years. Time will tell if the Class Action suit related to the Titans has any validity, however a suit in of itself is not evidence of wrong doing (lawyers file them all the time and make the vast majority of the money from them, normally by making threats and getting settlements).
3. You ask, "Why would (one) want to associate yourself with (Brock Pierce)." Well first of all he has done an enormous amount of work for the bitcoin eco-system since the early days. He is one of the people working to get Isle of Man and other jurisdictions to embrace the crypto industry. He knows just about everyone in the bitcoin space. 
4. He was elected to the Foundation Board of Directors by the Industry members.
I'm not here to say Brock is perfect or a Saint or that I have some special knowledge about these particular issues, however I'm tired of people tossing Brock under the bus for old allegations which were thrown out of court years ago, and some how trying to imagine future wrong doings. 
Every time I've met Brock at the bitcoin conferences he genuine, friendly, and highly interested in the technology behind projects. Thus is I believe Brock is a good guy and acting in good faith with his investments in the crypto space.

Thanks for the note. We have been talking about API Network for a while, but now that the crowdsale is here there is something for people to check out in more detail. Also the way the crowdsale works it has been specifically designed to run the whole 30 days, because the amount of BTC that can be collected is higher than the expected demand. So the community has four weeks to check it out, examine for themselves if it has merit and decide the price based on how much volume is sold.

@_date: 2014-04-19 20:46:41
The incentives for farming are setup so the more storage space you provide to the network the more SAFE coins you earn. Its similar to the competition between Bitcoin miners to provide hashing power. However in the case of the SAFE Network there isn't any wasted power or other resource as electricity is only used when a node is actually storing a file, which is the behavior that is rewarded.

There are many methods for placing a transaction into the bitcoin blockchain and I'm confident that the Factom core devs can maintain the code in a way that adapts to any changes in Bitcoin Core. Most of the Bitcoin Core devs are aware of Factom and some have come out as supportive of its approach to responsibly place hashes into the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:03:20
Hmm the link didn't load for me. I think it is likely that the officials will speak more openly about the project as it is implemented and rolled out. Institutions are conservative by nature and often only talk about projects deployed vs projects under development.

This video is helpful.
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:11:42
Bitcoin is THE essential incentive that led to the Bitcoin Blockchain having so much hashing power and thus such a high level security in the network. 
With that said there are lots of companies that the payment  / currency aspects of the bitcoin system are not the most compelling part of the technology. 
For these companies the blockchain as a world wide ledger provides something that solves a compelling pain point for their organization. We lose nothing to have these companies adopting bitcoin / the blockchain for reasons that are far from payments / currency and we gain a whole new level of participation from these players. Over time they will come to fully understand from a technical perspective how the currency and the ledger are complimentary and not mutually exclusive. In the mean time we as a community gain more traction and have time to bring them up the learning curve as we get them comfortable. 
The internet didn't take root immediately ether. For years companies used email that only could be sent in between their own employees. Over time those systems gave way to the world wide system we take for granted today because of its greater value proposition and technical experts built the tools so company employees could be safe in this new more open and global systems.

Right. So there is the physical set of documents. Those docs then get scanned and placed into a database. Along the way the lawyer / notary signs off, the bureaucrat processing he paperwork signs off, the owner of the land fills out the paperwork and so forth. Multiple parties have the records. Now when there is a dispute one can check mathematically who has the true set of records, when they were altered and by who.

I believe every time another large company or government announces they are going to use the blockchain, regardless of the number of transactions that come from that activity, it provides more and more awareness of bitcoin / blockchains. In addition it is clear that making the jump from using the blockchain for records and then getting comfortable to use it for money is much smaller than the jump from not touching the blockchain at all to using Bitcoin. In short this will bring big companies and governments up the learning curve.

When land registries went digital they became more centralized in databases that were easier to alter by the administrators. 
This has been a big problem in the developing world the last decade or so as records have been digitalized. 
One of the biggest benefits may be better mortgage rates for home / land owners, as the lenders will have a much higher level of confidence in this new record that is timestamped and audit able. People in the developing world often pay more than 15% annual interest on a mortgage which often prohibits growth in the economy. The high rates are because lenders have so little confidence in the records of the underlying assets backing their loans.

The consensus paper is the best place to see the full design of the distributed censorship resistant network. 
The progress toward this goal is described in the milestones on the Koinify profile. 
You will see milestone 3 is: 
"FULL P2P CONSENSUS MECHANISM
[A]. Factom network's Federated servers go live with the consensus mechanism. [B]. Entry Credit based election system begins operating for electing Federated servers"
@_date: 2015-05-19 21:10:52

2. All of Factom's code is open source.

Its interesting that many courts have already recognized digital signatures and hashes. The blockchain is built on those some technologies so I expect the existing presidents will be extended rather easily.
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:07:24
The transaction containing the hash that is published to the Bitcoin blockchain changes randomly / deterministically to a different Federated Server in the Factom Network every 10 minutes. If any particular Federated Server fails to publish the hash correctly the other Federated Servers detect that fact and kick out the bad actor and place a new anchor hash in the blockchain.
This is similar to if I asked "who publishes the next block of transactions in bitcoin?". I'd respond it is determined by which miner finds the next block reward and thus it changes often and is difficult to predict for the purposes of if a miner wanted to censor a transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:24:51

People pressuring governments to be more transparent... I'm ok with that.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:05:33
Yes. Though most don't want to make public statements until the projects are approved internally. Working with any large entity there are a lot of approvals involved and the process takes a number of months to navigate. 
The best is when there is an "advocate" internally that is passionate about the blockchain and gets the technology and is in a position to educate people inside the organization. 
We welcome introductions to advocates inside large organizations that is a great way to build a relationship. Abhi is a good person to contact in that regard.
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:30:17
Rather than securing identity specifically Factom is a more of a general data verification layer for any arbitrary data that a user / developer wants to make audit able. The whitepaper has a lot of details on the structure. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:18:21
So in this case the government is integrating their existing records in a way that is audit able and time stamped. If for example a record in the database happens to change inappropriately, now one can see when that happened, who signed for the change and so forth, it exposes bad actors. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:27:38
This depends on two factors. The number of land titles registered in a given year and the conversion rate of Factoids to entry credits. I think its a bit early to forecast either of these Factors. That said the more utility and demand for entries the more organic demand for Factoids there will be. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:02:58
When I use the term digital token I'm referring to coins such as bitcoin. The reason I'm using the term token instead of coin is that I want to be clear in my language that I'm NOT talking about "currency" or "payments" applications where the coins is used as a medium of exchange or simply put as money. Instead I am talking about tokens that are used to access a particular open source application.
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:32:08
I'd say more power to people building cool applications on the blockchain. We really don't feel competitive to many projects given the huge demand for this new technology.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:37:53
That's the great thing about the blockchain and the open source Factom Network, nothing is dependent on a central party. If Factom as a group disappeared tomorrow, then the records / proofs and software would just keep on running.
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:37:50
Well written and I agree with the conclusions about the block chain technology extending beyond payments and currency. By the end of the year we will see Decentralized Applications providing generalized compute, storage and bandwidth. Its going to be a wild ride.

The benefit to the Honduras title holder is clear. The records are now verifiable by math vs. by government central database. Record keeping is a real problem there and people either don't register their land at all out of fear or must pay really high interest rates because lenders have no faith in the underlying title record.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:47:45
Perhaps you could point me to a particular place in the white paper or consensus paper where you see all this "centralization" of Factom. 
The devs have spent a lot of time to make the Factom network work in a way that doesn't have any points of centralization, and is censorship resistant in the same way that bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-05-16 00:48:36
Oh no, my comment was similar to something someone else said..... : )
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:07:33
You make a fair point. That is in order for the problem to be solved the software has to be written in a way that checks everything as the record moves through the process and makes the whole process itself audit able. The important point is Factom and the blockchain offer a set of immutable tools that make it easier to catch bad actors and if well designed make bad actors think twice before trying to alter records in the future.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:51:06
We are big fans of the BitPay guys and all the code they have open sourced. Its sort of early to tell how much overlap there is with a system like this. We fully expect Factom to work in collaboration with a wide variety of other open source projects depending on what a specific project needs.

To answer the question above Factom does not control the database of the titles the people involved in the title process hold those records (notary, land owner, government employee doing the processing), Factom simply provides the ability to time stamp and make immutable records that are added to the Factom Network and then by extension the blockchain. The goal here is that each step in the process, each person that touches the records is provable in a way that is impossible to fake later.
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:30:57
Its helpful to be clear that the records in this case are not secured by a particular coin. Rather the hash (digital finger print) of the record is being added to the blockchain ledger via the Factom system which places hashes into the Bitcoin Blockchain. This video is useful to understand how the title project works. 
For general understanding of Factom see this video:

I really like the "World Wide Ledger" term. Reminds me of the good old days when everyone was first learning about the "World Wide Web" and the "Information Super Highway" : )
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:28:12
So lets draw an analogy to the early days of the web. Few corporations or countries had websites yet. While the tools existed to make websites, the companies often lacked the expertise to develop them. So a number of new website development companies formed that helped on board larger corporation onto the world wide web. 
Now this world wide ledger is emerging. Few developers know the ins and outs and so large companies and countries are looking to get on boarded by experts in the field. 
And for Factom specifically there are advantages to publishing data in the Factom network instead of everyone placing individual entries into the Bitcoin Blockchain. First by aggregating these entries the cost is lower. Second the ability to audit is increases as more and more chains are deployed on Factom one can audit across chains while having to only do one implementation.

I'm sure there will be plenty of the web wallets over time.
I really like Netki though and I paid my $2 USD worth of BTC to get my address locked in : )
I think human readable addresses are really important. A lot of wallets are still in the business of having me know long strings of random letters and numbers. It feels like back in the day when you needed to know the IP address of the place you wanted to go on the web. Justin and Dawn at Netki have hit on a really important issue here, I hope a lot of wallet providers embrace their service.
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:36:24
It sounds as if you understand the technical reason that Factoids could not be issued as one for one transactions on the bitcoin blockchain (colored coin style). Without the "compact commitments" you mention it would be impossible for users to place millions of entries into the Factom system without also flooding the bitcoin blockchain as a result. So a token to prevent spam, but that doesn't trigger a bitcoin transactions each time its is used is most certainly a technical requirement of a system such as Factom. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:38:29
For anyone that actual wants to know how the Factoid to Entry Credit to Entry in the Factom system works there is a whole paper on the subject here: 
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:20:55
Netki + Factom = Human Friendly Addresses
Netki Wallet Names now support Factoids and Entry Credits. Netki has implemented these address types into their consumer and partner offerings. All changes are live, and they have updated their API documentation. Netki users can go to their Wallet Admin, and add Factoid and Entry Credit addresses to their Wallet Name. These addresses can be static or a URL to an endpoint that dynamically generates addresses. The Factom and Netki collaboration means more friendly address for users. Netki has removed a barrier for mass-market adoption of the Factom system.

So all you have established is the the Factom team was and is still talking with the Honduran government. Made trips there, has a commitment from the property institute, is still working with Epigraph on the title project and that process is a long term thing and doesn't happen over night. Bravo.
We are going to go back to building blockchain technology and working on getting the world's companies to use it. Yep it will take a while and it will be tough and you can feel free to be skeptical that they will adopt it, but we will keep working toward making the world a more honest place.
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:54:08
The context is there was a political scandal where the last government got voted out in part because they were messing with the land title records. 
So new government gets voted in and this is one of their objectives, make the system of land titles immutable by bureaucrats and others that might have access to the property records.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:46:39
That's exactly what I'm talking about. You ask questions and regardless of the information that comes back, you then characterize it as "stupid". You are constantly making assertions about the Factom technology, but its clear from the statements you have not read the [whitepaper]( the [consensus paper]( or reviewed the working [Factom software code]( 
So if you are unwilling to review the source material, then this doesn't serve as a basis for "journalism" or intelligent debate of the facts, but instead sours people to engaging openly in this community because no matter what facts they present, they are attacked.
There is no difference from when a "journalist" makes unfounded assertions about Bitcoin and for whatever reason is unwilling to educate themselves on the topic or review source material.  
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:41:49


Actually that would not be wise. If one were to create a bitcoin payment for each and every one of the millions of entries that may be made in the Factom ledger it would have the effect of flooding bitcoin with transactions and the entires would cost much more (at least enough to meet the bitcoin dust level) that it would make many use cases impractical.

The article you are referring to didn't even come out until AFTER the Factom software sale was over.
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:09:54
Peter and Paul both are up to speed with the project, but its not a two man show. There are 7 full time core developers Paul is leading 99% of his time and there are 6 full time business development folks Peter is leading 99% of his time. 
Paul Snow is the lead core developer in the office 24 / 7 writing code and pushing the release candidates of the software. Peter Kirby is on the road at the conferences, meeting with the banks, countries and other interested parties wanting to use the Factom technology. 
Yet you want to grill Paul (the core developer) on business development progress details and at conferences your buddy grills Peter (the business side leader) on details of the protocol implementation and if you can find any small detail that's off you play this game of "hahaha gotcha that little nit is incorrect, quick let me post my gotcha to Reddit".
This kind of behavior really hurts community building and open discussion. It offers a disincentive for Paul to talk about business development and Peter to talk about the protocol to the extent of their knowledge.
There isn't any real content in this Reddit post. The facts are established that Factom has talked with the Honduran Government many times, visited the Honduran Property institute in country, got a commitment to use the Factom technology, that Epigraph is a title software company partnered with Factom on this project. Even the title of the very article you are referencing says "Honduras **to build** land title registry". The article doesn't say that the land title system is finished, not that its complete, but that they committed **to build** the land title system. It shouldn't be a surprise that working with big institutions is a long, and often slow process. But I give these folks credit for stepping forward to improve their systems using this new blockchain technology.
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:30:11
Note from Peter: "Hi all. Peter Kirby from Factom. We have a commitment from the head of the property institute/Chief of Staff of Honduras. Yes, politics in Central America are messy and slow and that's been delaying the roll-out and further discussion of this project.

Each time I have to make another send to a person using a fixed address. So for example I have to store the long unmemorable string of the address somewhere so I can retrieve it when needed. If the person I'm sending to uses a human readable address, instead its as easy as knowing their name and extension such as wallet.paul.bit 
Believe it or not I actually do have this exact use case on a regular basis because I do a lot of bitcoin and other digital token sends.
Its similar to needing to know a long string of characters to send someone an email or just knowing their name and domain and popping it in without the extra step of looking up the long string of characters. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:23:30
You say you have read the papers and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. 
But then you come up with assertions about why the Factom Network will be cheap to attack and the basis for your calculations doesn't sync with the basic math presented in the consensus mechanism paper. 
You calculated the cost of attacking the network based on a single day of usage, but its clear on page 11 of the consensus paper in the "Proof of Use" section that 180 days is the time frame used for voting weights by entry credit users.  
I'm not expecting you to know the Consensus paper as well as those coding against it to build the software implementation, but if you are going to attack something at least basing your assertions on source material might be a good place to start a more meaningful discussion of attack vectors which are addressed in detail in the paper.

I recently conducted a statistical analysis of the number of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain over its entire history.
In short, after a period of hyper growth from 2010 to 2013 the trend seems headed toward, the per day transactions doubling every two years or so. This would be in line with Moore’s Law, Nielsen’s Law and Kryder’s Law respectively for compute, storage and bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:40:26
I think the main issue is there wasn't a common language for them to use. Peter is talking fairly well about the process and Chris is asking questions with out knowing the system at a deeper level. For example at one point Chris thinks through there might be an issue with arbitrage when in fact entry credits are tied to a single public key and can't be transferred to another public key thus making arbitrage in that sense impossible.
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:49:38

That's partly why I did the analysis. I wanted to know if doubling every two years would be fast enough to keep up with demand for entries made on the World Wide Ledger and it seems that based on the current trend it is likely to be sufficient.

"The pre-release version is a major step forward. This iteration reflects the main components of Milestone 1, a working Beta.  
This is a quick overview of what can be done:
1. Factoids can move between addresses
2. Factoids can buy entry credits
3. Chains can be created
4. Entries can be put in chains
5. Entries can be read back
The largest improvements on the Alpha API vs. pre-release API are Factoids and entry credits are now working together. Factoids will be provided for those testing the system and in your wallet when you install it."

Correct. The core developers are with the Foundation which is pushing the open source client forward.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:00:33
Agreed. Though its annoying if your wallet doesn't know to put a higher fee in and your legitimate transaction is delayed as a result. Its difficult to tell what is spam, which are just small transactions, or which are transactions for the purposes of anchoring metadata.

All the API calls now work, both locally and via the server. Now its a question of robustness. Lots of testing needed to build confidence in the system.

This is an interesting question as it gets at the heart of how BTC is priced. Obviously there are a variety of factors involved some which will put upward pressure on the price and others that will put downward pressure on the price.
Here is my view...
Factors Increasing The Price of BTC in 2013
1. The Federal Reserve has said it will keep interest rates at 0% for all of 2013. Translation more USDs will be pumped into the financial system. Thus reducing the value of the USD compared to other currencies, which are not inflating their own currencies at the same high rate.
2. More merchants will adopt BTC as a means of receiving payments (WordPress, Lew Rockwell)
3. More users will adopt BTC to reduce the cost of spending and transferring their savings.
4. Security improvements as part of the 0.8 version BTC protocol and the ability to pay via a human readable names like WordPress.bit instead of only computer readable addresses will make BTC more mainstream for those less tech savvy. 
5. Other efforts like Coinbase being funded by Y-Combinator and Bitcoin-Central partnering with a registered payment processor in the EU will add to mainstream credibility.  
Factors Decreasing The Price of BTC in 2013
1. Roughly 1,314,000  new Bitcoins will be generated (25 BTC every 10 minutes 24/7/365) adding roughly 11% to the total BTC money supply. (Though this of course is half the rate at which BTC were being added to the money supply before this year's BTC discovery reward was reduced by 50% from 50 BTC per 10 minutes.)  
In summary without crunching a lot of numbers and putting together a detailed projection model (which I'm sure I will get to sooner than later) I won't hasard a guess as to the price by December 31st 2013. Though I will say that I am buying Bitcoins both for the purpose of savings and spending them.
@_date: 2012-12-29 00:14:43
Thanks for the heads up. I just donated some BTC. 
It feels like BTC is getting more and more momentum from merchants since the big Word Press announcement. I noted Lew Rockwell is also (like WordPress) using BitPay as their provider. 
I'm planning to have my own software company accept BTC when we launch our Beta in March. Any advice for a soon to be BTC accepting software as a service company?
@_date: 2012-12-29 05:52:10
_bc Thanks. I agree a series of big adoption announcements will lead to some short term spikes in 2013. However I'm more interested in the longterm value of BTC. To paraphrase Warren Buffet, (who was quoting Benjamin Graham) "In the short term securities behave like a voting machine rising and falling as people speculate, in the long term securities behave like a weighing scale, profitable companies rising and unprofitable companies sinking."   
@_date: 2012-12-31 06:36:11
G1, 
I'm glad to hear you are interested in making Bitcoin purchases easier for the non-technical folks out there. This goal in my mind is one of the most important for the Bitcoin community to tackle in 2013 and I have been seeing positive signs from a number of other start ups in the space and the new technical releases being discussed for version 0.8
I've been building technology companies the last eleven + years and I'd be happy to talk with you and offer what advice I can on how to go through the process of building a solid start up.
Feel free to private message me. I look forward to talking soon.

When I think of "alt coins" I think of projects seeking to replicate the functions of bitcoin as a payment network or currency. So LiteCoin, DogeCoin, and so forth. 
Then there are other projects such as Storj.io, SAFE Network, Factom, that have tokens but aren't trying to be payment networks or currency, rather they are using the digital tokens to power specific applications such as decentralized file storage or in the case of Factom a protocol for time stamping, auditing and proving business processes. Some people call these Application Specific Coins or just App Coins. I think the whole "coin" term leads to confusion so I just call them "decentralized applications" or Dapps.
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:58:43
Just to be clear, purchasers of Factoids will get 100% of the tokens they bought after the software sale.

They are elected by the users of the entry credits. So think of it as a decentralized delegated proof of stake, but instead of it being the holders of the tradable digital token which vote, it is those users that have actually converted their digital tokens into entry credits / entries into the Factom ledger that vote. There is a lot of detail on this subject in the Factom Whitepaper and Consensus paper:  and 
Also this is one of the deliverables on the third milestone: 
FULL P2P CONSENSUS MECHANISM

**TLDR; HealthNautica is an established medical records company and they are now committing to leverage the blockchain's immutable nature to enhance their proofs and auditing of records, via the Factom technology.**
Here is a link to the Coin Telegraph article on the subject: 
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:23:59
Agreed. 
Spelling nit, its Factom with an o. The Factum spelling with a u is the latin for "anything stated and made certain." 
To get a clean name space the Factom team picked the spelling version with an "o" instead of the "u". Similar to why the Google team picked that spelling vs. the "Googol" term for a 1 followed by a hundred "0s".  
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:45:38
So its good to note that these are actually much more than dust level transactions just to get attention for the 1Factom vanity address. 
The Factom team has sent along enough BTC (in some case up to $1 USD) for those receiving it to buy their first Factoid(s) in the software sale. 
At a minimum that gives them the opportunity to try out the Factom system after it goes live and make some entries of what ever data they want in the Factom ledger. 
And what we are doing is sending value across the blockchain. And given small / micro transactions of value over the network seem to be a well talked about and regarded use case. When we talk often about bloat its in the context of those placing non financial transaction into the blockchain. In those cases the data is much better to hash using a protocol such as Factom vs. placing it directly into the blockchain.
The reason for this distinction is that bitcoin monetary transaction really need to be validated on chain, where as data can be hashed and validated via a hash. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:56:57
I don't believe Vitalik is a scammer. I've meet him a number of times he is genuine in his beliefs and his technical approach. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:20:26
That's fine if you are the only one that needs to validate the audit of the hash. As soon as there is a third party involved, then the solution you propose creates a trusted entity.
Should one trust Bank of America to publish the hash or is it best to have an open system where either the mortgage holder or the bank can publish the hash and either can validate the information in the mortgage chain of records without trusting the other.
@_date: 2015-04-03 05:34:17
If anyone has a "bone to pick" with me I'm not sure of the reason.
I give the author, smartfbrankings, Justus, and the other vocal opponents in this thread and other threads, the benefit of the doubt that they hold their view genuinely and not for reasons of personal dislike / attack. 
Thus I will articulate my counter views and at a minimum the magic of Reddit is that it offers a forum for healthy debate of these important questions. If no one asked the questions, then I wouldn't have the opportunity to expand on my reasoning and thinking in these cases.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:31:15

Well actually there are a number of advantages to using Factom as more and more companies adopt it, thus it establishes a very strong network effect. 
Verifying different chains of hashes is substantially easier when said chains are maintained in the same consensus network, by the same set of nodes. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:17:02
First, core misunderstanding of Factom.
Factom is structured in a way that provides tools for building auditing systems, while allowing the developer to set any rules for auditing that she desires, rather than dictating those parameters to her.
Yes, consensus historically has been very difficult. What you seem to miss here is that the reason for that is one system of record has no way to validate another system of record without introducing trust.
Here for the first time one can build a universal system of record where multiple parties can establish consensus with out introducing trust. The comments you are making comparing distributed ledgers to centralized alternatives on a cost basis seem to indicate you don't value that aspect very highly.
Second, core misunderstanding of Factom.
The price of the entry credits is not fixed at 0.1 pennies. The conversation rate of Factoids to Entry credits is dynamic and set by a vote of the Federated Servers. The cost must be high enough to prevent spam, but low enough to offer a cost competitive advantage over placing entries directly into the bitcoin blockchain for example. 
If the costs were as low in Factom as in a central database then spam attacks would be common and so there must be a meaningful cost to placing an entry in a distributed ledger. If the costs are too high than usage will be lower, this is a balance the Federated Servers will have to determine based on the market and real world usage of the Factom system.
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:50:02
Thanks for replying. Though you seem to have my motivations reversed. I'm the buyer of these digital tokens. I bought Bitcoins, Omni, MSAFE, API, SWARM, FACTOIDS, and so forth. I'm not short term trading these digital tokens, rather I'm a long term holder. So if I'm wrong about the need for a digital token in the long term I'm the one holding the bag having placed my own personal value into it.
As for your article it is well written and I agree with many of its economic points. As far as I can tell from our discussions we are very close in our thinking when it comes to economics. However despite my agreement with you on the subject of letting market prices determine block size, the block size issue is still very much with us right now and has yet to be resolved in code. 
In addition this still does not address my points on decentralization and removing gate keepers. As you well stated, "Markets are better than central planners" and I see these digital tokens as a means of implementing free market conditions rather than having central entities becoming gate keepers or bottlenecks in the decentralized system we are all seeking to create.

This Honey Badger video is pure gold. I hand't had a laugh that good all week. Having met Julia in person a number of times, she is one of the most funny and witty people in the space.

Jacob's comments were not really on this topic at all. I believe his intent was the express that Wall Street and the technology that powers it today is going to be changed in a real way via blockchain technology. 
That is to say, the addition of a new currency to Forex trading (BTC) is less disruptive than the addition of honest, audit able, immutable records verifiable by any third party.
The Bitcoin blockchain is the "root of security" because of the block reward and the value of bitcoin which provides the means by which a miner is rewarded and as a result has the means by which to continue providing hashing power to the network.
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:07:49
This video explains it fairly well: 
It really boils down to three reasons. 
1. Anti Spam Mechanism: If it costs something to make an entry the network prevents DDoS attacks.
2. Removing Bitcoin Bloat: Lets not flood the bitcoin network with millions of tiny transactions, and if the Factom protocol used bitcoin for its native token then that would be the effect. (Note you can buy entry credits for BTC, Factoids are just an internal mechanism to incentivize servers.
3. Decentralization: In order to remove gate keepers and make the system censorship resistant, the software must be the one handing out the rewards and not a central entity.
If you want the hard core details they are in the consensus mechanism paper: 
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:49:37
The Federated Servers are elected by the users of the protocol. Mining pools in Bitcoin are selected by the miners who chose to give them hashing power. In either case their is no gate keeper, anyone can start a mining pool and anyone can add a Factom node that may be elected as one of the 32 Federated servers.
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:32:22
So actually this is a common misconception which started based on the fact that Factom uses Koinify for its software sale (Koinify normally issues tokens on using Counter Party).
The Factom tokens (Factoids) are not issued on either Omnilayer or CounterParty. Instead the Factoids will be issued in the genesis block of a Factoid chain in the Factom ledger itself (this is part of the first milestone expected post May 15th).
To be clear both CountryParty and OmniLayer could begin encoding data in the Factom ledger (if they so choose) for costs, speed, and anti bloat reasons, but then it would be a case of CP and Omni encoding data on top of the Factom ledger, and in turn secured by the Bitcoin Blockchain, rather than the other way around. 
I hope that clears it up. Factom is agnostic and friendly to both CP and Omni.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:06:29
I agree with many of your conclusions on alt coins, due to the power of the network effect. 
My contention here is that not every digital token is an "Alt Coin".
Some tokens represent assets (Tether for example), some provide access to a specific application, some serve as a means of access for other software. There are going to be world of these tokens, they are here to stay and this model is going to continue to get more popular given its a very friction free way to track all of these access rights, ownership, and so forth.

Well the RAFT algorithm, which Factom is closest too has been around for a while and is fairly well proven. The complexity comes in where you decentralize the process where the lead node is dynamic.
In any case after 10 minutes you don't have to trust the Factom consensus mechanism, it all gets hashed into the Bitcoin Blockchain forever.

If I can't convince you that time stamping, immutability, and decentralized censorship resistance data publication is worth 0.1 pennies per entry, then all I can say is that others are finding it valuable and the market will decide. 
As evidenced by all the partnerships Factom announced in the last few weeks (Tether, Rivetz, Serica, Coinapult, and so forth) . Many of which you can see featured on the blog:  
The economics seemed pretty simple to them. Pay a bitcoin transaction fee to get these same features or do it for 5 to 50 times less the cost in Factom.

I'm not a key holder on the multi signature address for Factom. And even the Factom Foundation has no access to the funds until after it delivers the code, you might want to check out the three milestones. 
**FACTOM BETA RELEASE**
[A]. The beta release of the Factom client includes having various subsystems operational. (i). Packaging user Entries using Merkleized block structures. (ii). Anchoring blocks into the Mainnet Bitcoin blockchain using a single server. [B]. The beta release of the Factom client includes the Factoid chain. (i). Construct a genesis block from the Factoid software sale designated public keys. 
(ii). Factoids can be reassigned to another address after checking cryptographic signatures.
**FRONT END &amp; FEDERATED SERVERS**
[A]. Storefront for selling Factoids and/or converting them into Entry Credits for users. [B]. Factom is running on a P2P network and has 8 appointed Federated servers coordinating block creation.
**FULL P2P CONSENSUS MECHANISM**
[A]. Factom network's Federated servers go live with the consensus mechanism. [B]. Entry Credit based election system begins operating for electing Federated servers

I read your article in detail and responded to you with the following comment below, but you have not yet replied. Factom's distributed ledger does a number of things that are impossible for a centralized database, yet you continue to compare them as if they were in the same category.
Altoz, You are correct in saying that Factom entries will be more expensive than those of centralized alternatives. This is a factually correct statement. By there very nature, all blockchain solutions will be more expensive given the greater amount of hardware, energy and redundancy involved in distributed consensus.
Allow me to tell you a true story that demonstrates why the "premium features of time stamping / unomdifiability / decentralization" are so much more valuable than normal database entries, that makes the comparison very much Apples and Oranges.
Our story begins in a certain central American Country. A few years ago, the world bank thought they would be helpful and sponsored the digitalization of the countries land title system. $100 million USD was invested in scanning, storing and otherwise transferring all records to a digital format. A top four consulting firm was hired to provide a nice state of the art title system based on a centralized database.
However when this system was turned on not all went well. The bureaucrats with the God powers on that central database, somehow found themselves in ownership of a bunch of beach front property : ) The whole thing turned into a big scandal, came back to haunt the government that was in power, and subsequently they lost the next election.
Now the newly elected government reaches out to Factom for a blockchain solution for these reasons. The title records can now be made to be "time stamped / unmodifiable / decentralized". So tell me what that is worth. A process by which records can be audited by anyone, any modifications to the records are known and provable (making bad actors easy to catch) and the proofs of which are not stored locally but rather globally.
Let me give you a data point to quantify this value. Interest rates on mortgages in this country are 18% per annum (and are in many places in the developing world). Mainly because the bad record keeping and impossibility to verify makes the underlying collateral (the land or home) worth far less in the eyes of the mortgage originator.
So now with Factom / Blockchain tech one can audit these millions of records, that are dynamically changing and being updated. Is that worth 0.1 penny's per hash? If you now have a higher level of confidence in the validity of a $100,000 USD of property, what is that value compared to the broken centralized system of record vulnerable to attack from the inside of the very institution.
This problem is well documented by economist Hernando de Soto who refers to it as the "dead capital" problem.

I certainly agree that some early software sales in the space turned people off and didn't have a lot of best practices in place. 
This isn't a random post on Bitcoin Talk by a lone whitepaper author with an idea. Factom has working code, a dedicated team, a detailed website about the sale, a secure multi sig address, milestones before the revenue is released, a community of developers building on top of the tech, and lots of reviews from technical experts.
I'm just pointing out that software sales with digital tokens are here to stay. The question is if the team / project is solid and if they are using these best practices.

When referring to large data sets and time stamping them to the blockchain, I was not referring to the size of the files that one can hash. As you note, one can hash files of any size. 
I was referring to placing a large number of hashes into the blockchain without having to create a OP_Return transaction for each hash placed into the blockchain. Image for example you are Bank of America and you want to time stamp / secure millions of individual mortgage records to the blockchain. Well obviously that would be both expensive in transaction fees and the block size limit would be restricting in this use case. 
Factom provides a way to publish an unlimited number of hashes and secure them to the blockchain with only 1 merkle root placed in the blockchain every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-04-01 17:03:57
The number of Factoids will be finite and knowable, though it is determined by the market based on the number of Factoids sold during the software sale.
You can check out the graphs on the Koinify page that gives you a good break down of the Factoid pools at the end of the sale in percentage terms and the future issuance is all to the Federated Servers that do the auditing of the hashes.

To be clear everyone at Factom understands the need for decentralized incentives and that bitcoin block rewards are the reason that the bitcoin blockchain has grown such an incredible level of security via hashing power in the network.
Jacob's comments were not really on this topic at all. I believe his intent was the express that Wall Street and the technology that powers it today is going to be changed in a real way via blockchain technology. That is to say, the addition of a new currency to Forex trading (BTC) is less disruptive than the addition of honest, audit able, immutable records verifiable by any third party. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:52:56
So I'd reply that as Jeff Garzik points out the bitcoin blockchain today is the "root of security", given its maturity, years of real world testing, and hundreds of millions of dollars invested in physical hardware operating on the network. So while you are correct anchors can be placed in many blockchains and I think this will lead to some interesting effects, Bitcoin is certainly the focus of Factom's efforts. 
I would say its a two way benefit, Factom certainly gains much of its security from Bitcoin, but wide spread adoption of Factom will significantly reduce the long term bloat issues of the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
As for the consensus algorithm Vitalik has just clarified above that "Your consensus algo is not all that complex; you're fine there." 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:31:13
You are only looking at the cost of the BTC fees (at current fee rates I might add) and presuming the hardware doing all the decentralized auditing costs nothing. 
Having a global set of 32 federated servers and 32 auditing servers available with 24 hour seven day a week up time, to audit and confirm every hash published into the network within seconds, and to have reputable entities to run these servers and audit each other in real time has a very real cost. This cost is covered by the Factoid reward that goes to the Federated Servers.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:09:45
Yes, a person can run a centralized version themselves. 
And for anyone else they would have to trust that central party. The whole point of Factom is to create a decentralized and trustless platform. 
People had centralized, cheap and easy to maintain databases for e-money before bitcoin. But then you have gate keepers and risk of censorship or the central party fails for what ever reason.

Justus thanks for the note. Your views on digital tokens other than bitcoin are well known in this community. However I wish you would offer a technically descriptive alternative for accomplishing the goals of anti spam, anti bloat, and decentralization without a digital tokens held by a decentralized network of participants. The Factom consensus paper is in Google Docs shared openly for comments, I hope you will add real substantive input there.
Are your contentions that?: 
* item 1 A. That software doesn't need an incentive to function and centralized companies should provide the best monetization model?
* item 2 B. That it is ok to bloat the blockchain with all of these transactions directly, and thus bitcoin can be utilized directly for every entry, instead of as a payment method to buy entry credits in the system?
* item 3 C. Decentralization only extends to bitcoin and that entities on top of bitcoin can not use the same model for incentives.
I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, please put forward your own contentions, I think that would lead to a more robust debate and the readers can decide, rather than simply questioning the motives of the people involved in these projects. 
The Omni protocol has succeeded in providing great new utility on the blockchain and made projects such as Tether and the SAFE Network possible. The MaidSafe team is pushing and testing real code and just presented at the Texas Bitcoin Conference on their next releases. If you are claiming these projects have failed I don't think that is supported by objective evidence.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:03:57
For an end user they will not need to interact with Factoids directly.
The end user will show up at a website, make a payment in what ever form the website accepts and the server that is holding the Factoids will convert those Factoids into entry credits and in the process assign them to the user's public address.
The user can then use their entry credits via the public address to make entries into the Factom network. 
This is very important to understand as its one of the intended features of the Factom protocol is to allow users to access the capabilities of the Factom ledger without having to deal with crypto currency security.

The basic function of hashing a document and placing it into the blockchain via a transaction has been around for a few years popularized as “proof of existence” or “time stamping”. Several websites provide this service where the user drags and drops the document that is to be hashed and placed in the blockchain for a small bitcoin fee. 
* item 1 The difference with Factom is the ability to hash very large data sets and secure them to the blockchain via the Factom network with a single anchor into the bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes. Thus helping scale this technique of time stamping for large scale applications which require many records (thousands / millions) to be secured. 
* item 2 The second difference from basic proof of existence / blockchain time stamping is the ability to create Factom chains that link together a set of time stamped records over time thus Factom provides for a “proof of process”. This also has scalability effects because one only has to check the particular Factom chain of records you care about to verify the proof instead of every record ever put into Factom. 
* item 3 All of these records placed into Factom chains can be audited in real time by the Federated Servers and Nodes so you can have a confirmation the hash has been published to that chains within a few seconds. 
I've published an informational report on Factom here:

So Factoids are the name of the token that is rewarded to the auditing servers. Factoids are converted into "entry credits" at a rate determined by the Federated Servers. 
Entry credits will always convert 1 to 1 to making an entry into the Factom ledger.
The video here explains it fairly well: 
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:45:40
1. I think that is a fair assessment. 
2. I believe that Paul and the team have put together a solid design to address the economics, even so there will need to be lots of testing and potentially adjustments to the model as we learn from its real world operation.
 
3. Also thanks for saying the consensus algorithm isn't too complex, a lot of folks take that comment during the whitepaper editing period out of context, so it's helpful to understand where your concerns really are.
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:02:46
So the economic incentives for the Federated servers are to encourage as many entries into the system as possible, because that uses more entry credits and thus uses more Factoids, increasing their scarcity. 
As for the price the entry credits, users will only use them if they are cheaper than alternative methods such as putting the entries directly into the bitcoin blockchain. This provides an upper bound on price potential. On the lower side if the price per entry credit is too small than the system is vulnerable to DDoS as it would be cheap to flood the servers with requests. That sort of gives you the lower bound of price possibilities. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:44:31
When BoA bought Country Wide they were given on the order of 10 Billion documents related to the millions of mortgages they purchased as a result of the acquisition. The blockchain does not currently support any where near the number of transactions that publishing the hashes of each and everyone of these documents would require. And yes at the cost of a few cents times billions of documents that becomes cost prohibitive regardless of and even more so for such a large organization. 
To your point about being willing to trust Google's Mail server, or Twitter, I'd point out that both of these services have been compromised and had down times in the past. And when a Twitter or Gmail account is compromised it doesn't result in a financial loss of money or extremely valuable verification in the same way that compromising a critical title or banking system does. Plus as soon as anyone did this type of securing on their services, then Gmail and Twitter would become higher value attack targets, which have not be built in a way that seriously prevents these types of attacks.
If this weren't the case people would be happy to issue all types of valuable assets on top of these services. There is a reason they do not do so. I'd further point out that Twitter and other public publishing services do not allow any use of their APIs that developers want. Twitter has shut out many developers and cool third party applications they didn't want on their service or that they thought would compete with their monetization model, simply by turning off their API access.
What you are proposing are cool little hacks (that while they would be fun to do), but are in no way realistically scalable or secure.
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:04:26
No worries. We appreciate your review of the whitepaper and I'm sure that any objective third party can see that peer review, comments and constructive feedback is a healthy part of developing a new system.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:00:49
Its important to understand there is no "we" that is charging for entry credits or setting the price. The price range in the whitepaper is purely given as an example.
Again the Federated Servers are elected by the users of entry credits, and they determine the conversion rate and by extension the price of entry credits. Thus the users have the primary voice in deciding the price of entry credits. Again this price will have to be high enough to prevent spam attacks on the network, but low enough to be cheaper than other distributed ledger alternatives.

A Factoid is a digital token that provides access to the Factom ledger via conversion into entry credits. Basically the right to publish data (via hashes) and secure / time stamp them to a blockchain).
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:14:11
Correct. You were giving an example of something that involves proof of existence, which is fairly straight forward. What I'm conveying is that proving the negative is far more difficult and something that is not possible in a centralized system in a trustless manor. 
In addition the censorship resistance is another aspect that isn't possible with a single party trust model, hence my quoting of Brian as he so well articulated: 
"I think Factom sits in a sweet spot between your proposed centralized solution and Bitcoin's anonymous membership authority set (Proof of Work). The Federated servers must cooperate to move Factom forward, but like Bitcoin, require a majority to effectively censor a transaction. It is a whole lot easier to censor with Proofchains (single party making the entry into the blockchain).

Hey Altoz, I posted the comment in the last Reddit thread on this topic. 
Yes those are the core three. Time stamping, immutability (better term than unmodifiability) and decentralization.
You keep saying these features are available elsewhere, but the examples you gave of Twitter or Gmail are not decentralized, not immutable and not even guaranteed in their time stamping.
Time stamping, immutability and gate keeper less (decentralized) data publication is not easy. Just see the length of the whitepaper and consensus paper which describe the system in Factom to achieve those features.
I take your point that what is often described as the "garbage in / garbage out" problem isn't easy either. But Factom helps immensely in this regard too. One can now create a system where every change to a record is digitally signed and timestamped. That makes fudging records extremely difficult, when who is doing the changing and exactly when it happened is recorded forever and audit able by any third party.
You seem to draw a strange line in the auditing use case because Factom provides the tools to audit data (via time stamping) but leaves this in the hands of developers instead of doing it in the protocol. 
That's the whole point. Factom is a simple immutable data publication protocol and platform, which a thousand projects can build whatever they want on. Factom enables the use cases we describe, it is not seeking to build all of them itself. 
**Lastly, you have not addressed my question. How valuable is the ability to create immutably timestamped records which can not be censored at time the of publication, which can not be fraudulently modified later and are audit able by any third party?**
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:53:47
That is a pretty good way of describing it.

Side chains is focused on allowing users to transfer coins from the bitcoin blockchain to side chains through a process of mining. The great thing is side chains will enable these transfers without a third party and atomically.
As for Factom its focus in securing (time stamping) and kind of general data by publishing hashes in Factom chains and then aggregating them into a single hash which is placed into an OP RETURN transaction every 10 minutes. Think mortgage docs, titles, identity records, books, movies, pictures, any kind of information thats worth proving its existence and more than that being able to audit its creation and life cycle.

There is a small part of the bitcoin community that has a negative reaction to anything with its own digital token. Even when the need for the token is clear (anti spam, decentralization of incentives, anti bloat) there will always be a guy somewhere yelling "its an alt coin, all alt coins must die". 
I suppose its left over from the days of when people where forking Bitcoin to create competing payment network / currency systems such as LiteCoin (though its pretty obvious now that Bitcoin has won the network effect in these areas). And I suppose the red team / blue team, fan instinct is to boo the other "team". 
Which is weird in this case because Factom is building on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and gets endorsements from Bitcoin Core developers such as Jeff Garzik that read like this:

The Factom protocol controls the rate, just as it is set in bitcoin. So to change it would require Federated Servers and nodes to alter it in the protocol / client.
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:36:09
I think Factom's Chief Scientist Brian Deery said it best when replying to a similar question by Peter Todd so I'll quote him here:
"Factom is attempting to make a publishing platform which is simultaneously censorship and spam resistant.  This is what makes Bitcoin magical, and what Factom is trying to accomplish.  Last Summer, I went down the road that you are going down and kept coming up with a system that was susceptible to either one or the other.  I gave the entities you described the glorious name **Compaction Service Providers** (CSP) and even wrote about it [here]( back when we were Notarychains.  With free entry of CSPs, censorship would be limited, but the entire system would get spammed quickly, and there would not be a good way to accurately locate the data you needed.  Without free entry, once a specific CSP (or proofchain packager) was selected by a network, the CSP could selectively censor within that network.  Lock in effects would be strong, so switching the entire network over to a new CSP would be expensive.
The CSPs (and Proofchain packagers) could "exclude, delay, or reorder the customer's timestamped entries".  This is fine as long as the CSP doesn't have an incentive to do these things.  
You claim that proofchains packagers will be the very business that issues a stock.  Since stockholders are trusting the company to return dividends in the first place, the trust can be expanded to managing all the stock trades too.  In my mind, the company who issues the stock still may game the system they control for their personal benefit.  What is needed is a scalable disimpassioned 3rd party.  Something of the scale where if the company president calls up and says "Delay these disfavored parties" that the packagers tell him his company isn't big enough to push them around.
I think **Factom sits in a sweet spot between** your proposed **centralized** solution **and** Bitcoin's anonymous membership authority set (**Proof of Work**).  The Federated servers must cooperate to move Factom forward, but like Bitcoin, require a majority to effectively censor a transaction.  It is a whole lot easier to censor with Proofchains.
Bitcoin is optimized for proving a negative over the domain of Bitcoin value transactions.  Lets take a closed system like Counterparty's current implementation.  To prove the negative (that an asset has not been sent to someone else first) you need to parse the entire Bitcoin blockchain looking for Counterparty transactions.  One of two things will happen soon.  The 1MB limit will be raised, or not.  
* Raised blocksize.  In order to see if your Counterparty asset was doublespent, you will need to parse through many terabytes of Bitcoin transactions to find the few MiB of Counterparty transactions.  You would also need to wade through all the other embedded protocols like Omni, ProofOfExistence.com, and all the others in your search for Counterparty transactions.  Factom is setup so that interpreted protocols like Counterparty do not need to wade through all other protocol's data.
* Block limit stays.  Each Bitcoin transaction becomes expensive.  Each transaction might rise to $5, $10, $15, who knows.  Distributions to asset holders would cost hundreds or thousands per dividend.
"Factom is trying to be a censorship and spam resistant disimpassioned 3rd party, like Bitcoin."

How long do you think this view will hold up to objective reality? 
How many successful projects providing useful software have to exist before we can say that this model is proven.
I'm hopefully that as all the best practices come together we can move past bad actors. By requiring milestones, full transparency, and so forth, that will show you who the good actors are. There will always be bad actors out there, that's why we need to insist on actionable best practices such as multi sig.

Factom is a generalized data layer for the blockchain. Meaning you can time stamp any data you want using the Factom Network and its secured by the full hashing power of the Bitcoin Blockchain via hashing that are placed every ten minutes via 1 single transaction into the Bitcoin network.

The logical thing to do is reward those that are creating value in a system. In the Factom network that is the severs auditing all of the entries that go into the Factom Chains and are thus recorded by the ledger. 
Developers obviously also contribute value, and in addition those purchasing the initial Factoids in the genesis block are provably  contributing value. 
The Factom group will also be making a series of announcements around Milestones for example so that revenue collected from the Factoid sale is only released upon actually delivering the software.

Say what you will about the Omni Protocol, MaidSafe and similar projects, but in the end of the day, technology that didn't exist, now does exist thanks to this model. 
Thanks to Omni we have tokens issued on the blockchain and important bridges such as Tether can exist. 
Thanks to MaidSafe fully decentralized data storage is now a reality and others can use it and build on top of it. 
These projects have delivered real value to the blockchain community and enable others to build on top of their platforms. I'm confident that in 5 or 10 years when we look back on these projects I'll be proud to say that I played a part in supporting them.
I'm in this ecosystem for the long term.

That's a good suggestion on language usage.
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:16:40
This really is true from a technical perspective. There are three core reasons you see tokens adopted by each of these protocols. 
1st you need the anti-spam mechanism. If there is no cost to making entries or transactions in a system someone will DDOS the system with trillions of calls. So its generally accepted that a token that has a value is required in order to battle spam attacks.
2nd unless you have a native token then there isn't a way to reward nodes in the system in a decentralized manor. If there were a pot of bitcoins used for a reward than a central entity would have to hold that pot and dole out the rewards leaving the system vulnerable to censorship and gate keepers.
3rd the point above I made about fighting bloat remains. You mentioned there are "plenty of mechanisms to avoid bloat". Despite your statement the normal way to "fight bloat" is to move transactions off chain. However when you do this the records are no longer publicly audible as "off chain" means a private database. When you do this you are once again in the position of trusting a central entity controlling that off chain data base. One of the core values of Factom is the ability to secure a record to the blockchain without bloating it, but at the same time keeping all the records publicly audit able via the Factom chains and anchoring those chains with just a single transaction into the bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:52:01
Actually yes, Factom will be leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain. Every ten minutes the Factom system aggregates all the data (mostly hashes) published on its platform and anchors 1 transaction using OP Return into the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
This video talks about how it works from a very high level. 
The deeper tech is in the whitepaper and code: 
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:37:07
It is not a fork of bitcoin. The Factom network works by placing hashes (they call anchors) via OP Return into the Bitcoin Blockchain. The goal being to secure general data, documents, really any digital content that people want to record, audit, or otherwise validate.
The website has links to good videos that explain it + the white paper.

Well this guy's been around for a while: 
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:48:05
I have not claimed that Factom "stores" the books from the Gutenberg Library. The raw files are "stored" on BitTorrent which we have made plain in any of the discussions about the Gutenberg demo. Factom is not seeking to be a data storage system, BitTorrent, MaidSafe, Storj.io are all focused on that use case. 
When I say "Factomize" I am referring to the hashing (client side), entry made in the Factom chain, aggregation of the chain hashes into the directory blocks, creation of the merkle root hash for publication of the "anchor" in the bitcoin blockchain.
Factom is about providing a public directory that can be used for verification of published hashes.
While you are correct that creating hashes is a straight forward process and in fact is done client side in the Factom world, the decentralized publication of those hashes in a manor that is both spam resistant and censorship resistant is difficult. Hence the length of the white paper and consensus paper. 
If you get into the technical papers, much of the time is spent detailing how to address attacks vectors and edge cases in the peer to peer network and consensus mechanism. 
Whitepaper: 
Consensus Paper:   
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:14:43
That's awesome. Whats the TL:DR on C4?
@_date: 2015-03-13 06:07:04
Allow me to explain the difference: 
"The Proof of Existence Case"  where one hashes the library as a whole. 
"The Factom Case"  where one hashes each individual book, then places the hashes into a directory block, then hashes the directory block and placing it into the blockchain.
The difference is A. How fine gain your auditing can be later and B. How many entries are required in the Bitcoin Blockchain to achieve that desired accuracy of auditing. 
In case  of just hashing the whole library, than one can only verify later if the whole library is the same as before or if someone has altered data and broken the hash. That's it.
In case  of hashing each book, then the directory block, one can check the hash of every individual book to see if there has been a change or not. One could hash individual pages or even small bits of data all depending on the use case.
As a result in the proof of existence case  there are 29,000 entries into the Bitcoin Blockchain required to secure the 29,000 books if you hash them individually in order to achieve book by book auditing. 
As a result in the Factom case  there is only 1 entry into the Bitcoin Blockchain in order to anchor all 29,000 of the hashes from each individual book, in order to achieve book by book auditing.
When your goal is to audit large data sets, while maintaining very fine grain merkle proofs, and make them timestamped and verifiable via the distributed consensus of a blockchain, without causing "bloat" in the process, than Factom offers you the tools to accomplish that.  
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:14:12
The answer lies in Brian's reply above. If we were to just take VC money and charge per installation or per entry we would be creating a central entity that would act as a gate keeper. Systems with gate keepers tend to censor users over time, where as Bitcoin which is decentralized has proven to be very censorship resistant. That is the due goal for Factom, to be both spam and censorship resistant which is the reasoning for having the native token. Without the native token the network has no ability to reward participants (federated and auditing servers in this case) in a decentralized way.
@_date: 2015-03-12 14:53:21
I'm sorry you don't like the decentralized application model of building software, but both Storj.io and La'Zooz have both delivered working applications that users can benefit from. If another project creates better versions later than wonderful, that doesn't negate the value of the work they did or invalidate the model they used to achieve that.
As for speakers I think its a great line up this year, Charlie Shrem., Bruce Fenton, George Gilder, Steve Stockman, Robert Murphy, Guillermo Peña Pantin, plus I'm sure they will announce more. 
Plus they were able to drop the ticket price from over $300 to just $150 for a two day event, and this year it located in downtown Austin at the moody theatre.

@_date: 2015-03-16 04:22:58
Thanks for the note. You still seem to have a gap in understanding of what Factom does. I'd recommend you read the whitepaper on the  website. Yes you can indeed hash both a whole library or a book using Proof of Existence, but that does not address my point about being able to audit each book individually if one were to hash the library as a whole.
The book and library analogy is simply a useful example that Factom is about more than publishing a single hash in the blockchain, its about chaining records together to do a full proof of process that can be audited in real time and without trusting a third party.
If you really think the coding for Factom is easy I'd welcome you to review the many lines of code in the Factom Github repo and see what is involved in building this type of platform in a fully decentralized manor.
As for the software sale I'd recommend only those that understand the Factom protocol and its utility to purchase tokens that will access its features. The features of the Factom protocol are useful regardless of the price of BTC. If people find value in the Factom network they will buy access, if they don't find value in Factom then they will not buy the tokens. Its as simple as that.
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:18:27
Well its cool to see that so many projects see the value of using the blockchain for non-financial transactions in a responsible way that doesn't cause bloat. 
My real hope is that by everyone knowing Factom is an option to build their application on we can really make meaningful progress on the scalability of the blockchain where billions of documents / records can be secured in a way that maintains decentralization. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:48:04
I'd point out that the Factom APIs are already live. Here is the link feel free to check them out.

Thanks for the question. The Factom Foundation team is getting fairly big. There are 12 full time staff and most of them are the core developers. You can see the list on the  website. Since its all open source you can see the actual code coming together on the Factom Github account

@_date: 2015-03-11 16:04:03
The Factom team considered using Bitcoin as the native token in the network. However if you were to do so, you would then have another bitcoin transaction for each entry into the Factom ledger. Given that one of the goals of Factom is to remove bloat from the blockchain, putting hundreds of millions or even billions of additional non financial transactions back into the blockchain didn't seem a rational move.
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:28:47
Why would one not want smart technical reviewers to point out all aspects and angles of a decentralized network while in early development? Peter's is making technical points about different use cases, Factom just happens to be aiming at different use cases than what he is working on with his project, as he clearly states in his notes and as Brian points out in his reply.
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:33:08
The Factom Core Devs actually are looking at the Sidechains technology to understand how best for Factom to integrate with it. But weather Factom places anchors into a Sidechain or directly into the Bitcoin Blockchain isn't a big decision as we are only talking about 1 Bitcoin transaction every 10 minutes and thus it isn't a high transaction volume use case.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:49:54
Above I see Shawn from Storj.io, I see Brian the Chief Scientist of Factom, I don't know everyone. Though I for one have my 2 year Reddit badge : )
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:47:01
I'd point out that Factom is an open source project and as such any change to something as major as the Factoid reward would require consensus among the core developers, beyond that if such a new version of the software were ever proposed that changed the Factoid system it would have to be adopted by the users of the software. 
These are the same reasons that anyone ever trying to change the number of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin Network doesn't get very far. The Factom Foundation would not have control over such things in a centralized manor.

@_date: 2015-03-12 00:09:16
Well Sidechains is focused on the goal of atomically moving coins from the blockchain to a sidechain and back again without counter party risk. 
Factom is more about aggregating general data via published hashes and creating a thin directory layer and placing the Merkle root (via a hash) into the bitcoin blockchain.
So it doesn't seem Sidechains could provide the capability for Factom to become a tokenless or even bitcoin based system. Again comments and ideas are welcome in the whitepaper if you have ideas.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:42:24
Storj.io is definitely an important part. When anyone thinking about using Factom asks "where do I store the private raw data" its great to have a project to point them to for that purpose.

You said "to raise money for a project without having to give up any kind of ownership". That would imply that the structure picked here is a result of some group of people seeking to not give up ownership.

Thanks Peter. I hope you get a chance to delve more into the consensus paper and get a deeper understanding of the market use cases and the reasons we have structure the token in this way. I think you will find that there are a great number of folks who have a use case that requires the architecture that Factom is building. I know because I've sat in many meetings with the Factom team the last few months talking with large companies and a wide variety of users that need to make a great number of entires beyond what the current block size can or is likely to support in the near term.
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:05:14
Hyper, The number of Factoids sold will be determined by the market. There will be no artificial limit. Similar to Ethereum users will convert BTC into Factoids at a set rate, say 2,000 Factoids to the 1 BTC for example. Thus if 1,000 BTC come in during the sale than 2,000,000 Factoids would be created as part of the Factoid software sale. All the details will be released on the Factom Koinify profile.
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:17:49
Native digital tokens are a choice (in this case) that enables decentralization of the protocol is a manor that is both spam and censorship resistant. I recommend you check out Brain Deery's points above. 
Not every applications needs a token, some of those apps that do can use bitcoin, others need a token and it can not be bitcoin. These are all architectural valid choses depending on the goal the app developer is seeking to achieve.

Serica is a great platform for buying and selling Gold / Platinum with BTC and keeping those records of ownership on the blockchain is huge. I don't think most people realize how much traction and assets they have put on the blockchain the last 12 months.

The Factom Foundation is a non profit. There isn't any entity that it makes sense to hold ownership in.
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:56:36
Believe it or not I actually consider with every project I support what structure is the most rational for it. There are plenty of projects that don't need a digital token at all, there are those that can use bitcoin to avoid the spam problem and there are those that need their own native token issued on the bitcoin blockchain and lastly there are those projects that need a native digital token not recorded directly on the bitcoin blockchain but secured to it via anchor transactions. 
However the use of a token wasn't my decision with Factom. These logical technical conclusions were reached by the Factom Core Devs after months of consideration. If you want you are welcome to review the whitepaper and consensus mechanism and offer input. 
Consensus Mechanism:
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:48:02
Joe, As you may know I'm not one that is much interested in centralized hierarchies. See:  
As I mention in the article: "fiat currencies almost always decline in value and the vast majority throughout history collapse and cease to exist all together." See: 
What is interesting to me in the case of Tether and Digital Tangible is that they are possible because of the blockchain providing a trustless mechanism for transferring those USD / Gold dominated assets directly peer to peer. 
I certainly agree that in the past counterparty risk when it comes to the physical asset has caused the fractional reserve issue that we are all seeking to remove as a systemic risk from the monetary system.
This is why I highlighted I believe the adoption of real time auditing by any third party (via Factom) is critical. "Its incumbent upon the Tether and Digital Tangible’s of the world to offer solid real time auditing + 100% blockchain based transparency when it comes to the ownership of assets listed." And "Provided this can now be better accomplished with immutable records published on platforms such as Factom ( and secured by the blockchain, this age old challenge of counterparty risk may be more addressable than it has been in the past." 
I'm not interested in going back to past failed systems, but I do recognize that we have to offer a bridge for those still in the legacy financial system to make the transition to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:30:02
This is how far we have come: I'll check the public key, on my hand held computer, which is always connected to a global messaging network, to see how many Factoids were generated through sending of bitcoins to a multi signature address, which trigger cryptographic records, which are themselves stored on a distributed ledger forever, by thousands of unknown computers hard drives, spread all over the world, based on a reward that is handed out by software, directed only by mathematics.

I hear your points. However I would say that this is a process and getting Merchants to accept BTC at is a very big first step. Most, if not all, of these merchant services offer an option for Merchant to keep a percentage of their sales in BTC, which some such as Overstock decide to do. As their understanding of the technology increases and merchants put pressure on their suppliers to take BTC the opportunity to integrate the rest of the value chain becomes a reality.
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:18:03
I wish you would reply to my points and present evidence for why you believe they are invalid instead of making "every blank ever" jokes.
Also you might consider as more and more projects use this decentralized digital token model (either their native token or the token of another platform) that maybe, just maybe, there is merit in such an approach given it is being used by serious technologists such a Vitalik Buterin, David Irvine, and Paul Snow. 
These are serious people out to build extremely important technological advances, not turn a quick buck or chose the wrong structural approach for their platforms that would damage their reputations in the long term.

Honestly I'm not sure why you insist on calling the Texas Bitcoin Conference the "Mastercoin Conference". Neither the MSC Foundation or the Omni Foundation are involved in the organization of the conference.

It really boils down to a question of use cases in this debate. 
Peter is pointing out that for use cases where one is willing to pay the bitcoin transaction fee to add a record directly into the blockchain then that is preferred given their is zero intermediary.
Brain is pointing out that in use cases where the number of records involved realistically prohibits the user from adding those records directly into the blockchain one needs an intermediary, ideally one that is "censorship and spam resistant disimpassioned 3rd party, like Bitcoin".
The value of the Factoids will thus reflect the number of users that require lots of entries and thus Brian's solution of Factom, minus those users that have use cases where they require few entries and can use the solution Peter is discussing.
Simply put if you are Bank of America and you want to secure 10 Billion Mortgage records than Factom is very attractive. If you want to secure the hash of 1 driver's license then OP Return directly into the blockchain is your friend.
I say that with the caveat that there are those in community that strongly believe zero non financial data should go directly into the blockchain and if individuals do it even a little, everyone combined will bloat the blockchain. 
For those in this camp Factom represents a place to point people and say, "Why are you bloating the blockchain? Just use Factom to aggregate all that data and every 10 minutes Factom will anchor it into the blockchain. That way you get the same level of proof of work, but for a lower cost and without the bloat."

Tradle.io is really doing some awesome stuff by bringing blockchain technology to whole new set of industries that have big friction in their record keeping processes.

@_date: 2015-03-31 16:02:09
Good question on the Factoids running out due to lots of usage eventually. 
Since the conversion rate of Factoids to Entry credits is determined by the network, if Factoids become more scarce then the network can vote to increase the number of entry credits created per Factoid.
Meaning that the network can move from 1 Factoid converting into 10 entry credits to a rate of 1 Factoid to 1,000 entry credits or even 1 Factoid to 10,000 entry credits.
This dynamic conversion rate is really important to understand because it is how Factoids maintain a variable price and the network (the elected Federated notes) can work to keep the price of entry credits and thus entries into the Factom system more level over time.
To your other point there are indeed new Factoids given by the network to the Federated Servers for their auditing and publishing of the hashes. So over time it would seem a balance would develop between Factoids being used in the system and new Factoids rewarded to the servers. Where that balance is set will be up to the market.

TheMusicGod1, 
Thanks for the reply. I have not gotten any XRP yet. I'm still interested to try it out, but ThePiachu seems still to be the only one selling and the auction for the 1,000 he is offering isn't going to be over for several days.
By the way I agree with you the value of XRP will likely rise over time as the WOT grows and as stores begin to accept it. I'm of the opinion both BTC and Ripple are better alternatives than traditional inflation prone Fiat funny money, so we are certainly in agreement there. 
As to my offer if we can agree at $10 Million as a fair price for the Ripple network as a whole today*, then I'd be happy to offer you say, 0.01 BTC for 2,422 XRP or 0.02 BTC for 4,844 XRP if you have that many XRP remaining. I'm looking forward to trying them out! If you want to sell me less XRP that is fine too, just let me know.

Lets reserve the word "alt-coin" for those currencies actually using an "alternative blockchain".

2. It has been suggested that 200,000 mBTC (roughly $20,000 USD)  level investments will have the most impact an a very early team.
3. The Bit Angels at the first meeting expressed an interest in early-stage (idea, concept, + team, website / prototype). 
The idea is to be very Y-Combinator-ish. Meaning invest enough money to allow a hacker or two to focus 80 hours a week on a new startup they have been developing during weekend and evenings.
TLDR: If you have a startup that will put Bitcoin adoption into hyper growth then come talk to the Bit Angels.
Areas identified by the Bit Angels during the first meeting include:
Color Coins (shares, bonds, etc...) that can be issued off chain and merged with the Bitcoin blockchain open ledger
Escrow - Leveraging reputation systems, multi-party signatures functions, and a trusted party to enable a scalable escrow system
Bitcoin In Developing Nation - Text message based system for Bitcoin - Feature phone capable Bitcoin systems.
Bitcoin Wallet for the Masses - Send Bitcoin via Twitter, Facebook
Peer to Peer Mining / More advanced 26 nm Chipsets
Hardware Wallet Companies - Tech to make securely storing BTC for the masses. 
Jurisdictions Friendly To Bitcoin - Blueseed, Honduras, General Governance

That's what I've been trying to figure out. I've been on a 2 week long technical dive on this, read the paper a few times, talked with J.R. multiple times, and I talked with other technical experts in the Bitcoin community, some of which like it and some of which are critical of parts of the proposed implementation strategy. For myself at least in the end of the day it boiled down to the question of, "Will this effort benefit the Bitcoin eco-system and accelerate important new features?" I have come to believe the answer to that is, "Yes", it will benefit the Bitcoin eco-system. I fully expect there will be technical challenges and it has to be implemented in the right way that doesn't put a burden on the Bitcoin blockchain, but instead adds new tools and capabilities. Therefore I'm deciding to get involved and offer what help I can to make sure it gets implemented well.

Correct the earlier versions of the Mastercoin Spec stored data in fake transactions (Class A) and later using Multi Sig (Class B), but thanks to Gavin's update with "Provably Prune-able Outputs" Mastercoin can now store data using Class C Transaction that don't either bloat the block chain or pollute the UTXO set. 
This is a really important update from Gavin. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:37:46
Really? Do we really need to have a Mastercoin / Colored Coin flame war every week? 
I'm not sure why you feel it necessary to publicly attack the Mastercoin open source project.
I don't see the lead developers of the Mastercoin project going around posting negative things about Colored Coins.
As a matter of fact we are talking with Peter and other very smart people about how to improve the Mastercoin Spec. This is an open source project after all, anyone is welcome to offer their suggestions on how to improve it.  Which as you note the spec has already improved a great deal from the original. 
Just one example is the "Contracts for a Difference" which was a great suggestion (by Vitalik Buterin) for how to implement what the spec proposed for Escrow Back Currencies in a better way, has now been adopted into the spec. 
Mastercoin will continue to improve with input from the community. Yes its early stage, yes its still very much in Alpha, despite these facts the community seems very supportive of our goals to develop a protocol layer on top of Bitcoin that has its own token.
I've written an entire whitepaper on the subject if you would like to dive in.
The paper is on Github and is also open source so if anyone wants to offer improvements please do : )
I hope you had a happy thanks giving brother : )

Anyone seriously interested in working with a Startup focused on giving users the ability to trade stock shares over the Bitcoin blockchain, let me know via private message. I'm building a company that will be making this a reality. You can meet me at the Bitcoin Conference in San Jose the 18th and 19th if you want to chat in person. Otherwise private message me on Reddit.

Great interview. Good description of the benefits. I think we should use the phrase "Bitcoin is Email for Money" to explain it to a non-technical audience.
@_date: 2013-10-18 04:02:31
1. I don't think doing a crowd funding event = "pre mining" (this isn't an alt coin - this is a segment of existing Bitcoins set aside for new Bitcoin features). If anyone did any "mining" it was done by all the hundreds of supporters of the project when they contributed their funds.
2. You make a pretty bold claim about "dacoinminsiter" doing some scam in the past. Care to back that up with a link or proof?
3. The market will decide if Mastercoins are worth anything based on their utility and how widely they are adopted. 
4. You or another critic of Mastercoin said before "dacoinminsiter" would run away with the funds. Well here he is paying them out as promised to developers contributing real code (none to himself). With more contests to be announced shortly.
5. The story here isn't that different from Bitcoin. Mastercoin is not centrally controlled by anyone (J.R. could get hit by a bus tomorrow and all the code, clients, protocol and the rest would keep on functioning and moving forward in their development). 
6. The Mastercoin Foundation doesn't run any of these services (nor will it in the future) any more than the Bitcoin Foundation runs Bitcoin businesses or controls the Bitcoin protocol. Its an open source project from day one, you can go ahead and folk the code on Github right now.
7. You question dacoinminister's real identity. Even though J.R. was in person at the Bitcoin conference in San Jose (see video of him on The Bitcoin in the Future Panel)  + he has been in the Bitcoin community since January 2011 on Bitcointalk Forums.
Are these really concerns or are you just tossing rocks at J.R. for some reason? 
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:48:05
KingJulien, Agreed. That was my  take away from the 2013 Bitcoin conference in San Jose. There are a ton of new companies accepting BTC about to be announced. Existing BTC companies are growing at unbelievable rates, 15% week over week from several sources I talked with at the conference. Experienced entrepreneurs, developers and investors are jumping into the ecosystem. The number of transactions / users is doubling every four months according to Gavin's talk. With 5 to 10 million early adopters now, if it keeps growing at the current rate it won't be long (16 to 24 months) before Bitcoin hits 100,000,000 users. If ASICminer is any indication the first $1 Billion USD market cap company is likely to emerge from the Bitcoin eco-system in the next 12 months. Its off to the races ladies and gentlemen, its going to be an interesting year. - DJohnston
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:11:09
Come on Perish, yet more FUD. You know that Mastercoin protocol doesn't add any burden to the Bitcoin protocol. The Class C Mastercoin transactions use the Provably Prune-able Outputs being implemented in the 0.9 version of Bitcoin. They pay their way in transaction fees and none of the nodes has to store the extra data. You should really read the update from Gavin on the latest version of Bitcoin.

I for one, am glad of your work on this topic Peter. I saw your presentation from San Jose and I'm following your publications.
I agree with your assessment, the protocol is very early in development and we have an opportunity to improve it in lots of ways.
Thanks for getting involved.
P.S. I really enjoyed your write up on Dark Wallets just recently to the Bitcoin developer group.

I happen to be one of the people that believes the blockchain ought to be use case agnostic. If  anyone wants to pay transaction fees to store meta data in the blockchain in a responsible way that doesn't cause bloat or pollution, then I don't see why they should be stopped. Lets allow the free market to find the best use cases and not try to centrally plan things.
@_date: 2013-03-03 05:22:37
When  starts accepting BTC on March 22nd I will definitely adopt this strategy of passing on the processing fee savings to our users. Great suggestion!

To be clear I think the Colored Coins and Open Transaction projects are great. I know both Alex and Chris and I love which they are doing for the Bitcoin eco-system. With that said I think it is perfectly legitimate to also have an open source projects (such as Mastercoin) which people can crowd fund and by using the system and its coins support the development of these features we all want (distributed exchange and the like). I would point you Bitcoin itself hasn't taken off like rocket just because it is open source, but because it also has brilliant monetization built into the protocol which offers an incentive to everyone involved to promote its development, use and wider adoption.   
Mastercoin is about as decentralized as it gets. Distribution of initial coins was to ANYONE who participated in the funding (the funding effort was widely advertised on Reddit, Lets Talk Bitcoin, Coin Desk, BitcoinTalk). All the code is open sourced. Anyone can buy and own MSC. Anyone is welcome to contribute code. No company or individual owns anything close to a majority of the MSC coins. J.R. may be the biggest owner at something like 20% to 25% of the MSC, but then again he had a huge investment of 1,200 BTC of his own money into the effort.
Personally I think we ought to develop more protocols on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that are supported by a coin for the use of their features (its a form of decentralized crowd funding). This is a sustainable way to compensate developers to build new advanced features that all of us in the Bitcoin community want. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:48:14
To your point about "centrally controlled" I wanted to note that the Mastercoin protocol is open source from day 1. The Mastercoin Foundation will not control the protocol or have any means of issuing new Mastercoins. The ownership of the Mastercoins is already fairly distributed to the 500+ people that are contributing and they are free to sell those Mastercoins to others so ownership will quickly spread. The Mastercoin Exodus Address (and thus the BTC sent to the Exodus Address) serves as a common point of reference for those that want to implement the features of the Mastercoin Protocol on programs that interact with the Bitcoin blockchain.
Secondly, the features that are discussed will not be operated by the Mastercoin Foundation, anyone is free to build and operate these features leveraging the open source tools that are developed. As for compliance people that implement any type of operations should be aware of the rules in their jurisdiction and be sure to comply with them. (Just as Bitcoin Exchanges must do). 
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:53:34
I'm glad to see you will be presenting at the Bitcoin conference, I believe the Bitcoin community will be extremely receptive to the vision of Blueseed. I read the outline you posted on the Bitcoin forums and it seems comprehensive.  
My only feedback I would offer is to suggest avenues in which the Bitcoin community members can be actively involved in the Blueseed effort. For example joining as entrepreneurs, being evangelists in their tech communities, supporting the series A, technical or developmental work.  
See you in San Jose Friday.

To the point on "bloat" meaning adding lots of transactions to the blockchain, I'm of the opinion that as long as a transaction plays by the rules, then the blockchain should be neutral to the type of transaction. Over time the market will decide if the transactions being added are valuable enough to be included based on the size of the transaction fee that use case is able to support. In general the blockchain is growing quickly and the developers are going to implement solutions to address this. Ultimately if Bitcoin is going to scale we need to address this issue. So if these transactions serve a use than I don't object to them.
To the second question of "polluting" the blockchain. The intension is not to do this. No one wants to fill up the blockchain will fake transactions that don't provide value. I think there are ways the Mastercoin protocol can be properly implemented that will address this concern.
@_date: 2013-05-28 10:55:58
You make a fair enough point. I agree in the sense that the gauge of Bit Angels success will be the actual startups it funds and how much they end up contributing to the Bitcoin/Crypto eco-system. I can say that from the members I've talked to, the thing that drives them is they want to see Bitcoin become easier to send (via SMS, email, FB, Twitter etc..) to enable Mass Adoption, develop more secure wallets, expand crypto tech beyond transfer of money (using Color Coin type technology) to enable other use cases like stocks, bonds, smart property, build up Bitcoin Friendly Jurisdictions and see it adopted heavily in the developing world. When Bit Angels makes a meaningful contribution to one of these goals, then for me it will have been a big success.
@_date: 2013-02-02 23:15:56
Have you checked out or did you consider Coinbase? I'm curious as to why you decided on Bitpay over Coinbase (both seem like great companies I'm wondering if it was a technical reason or just because you knew of Bitpay and not Coinbase.)  
I ask because I'm in a similar spot as you. I'm planning to accept Bitcoin come March for my software as a service company. I look forward to your thoughts.

So there are two important questions here, one of bloating the blockchain and one of polluting it. To the point on "bloat" meaning adding lots of transactions to the blockchain, I'm of the opinion that as long as a transaction plays by the rules, then the blockchain should be neutral to the type of transaction. Over time the market will decide if the transactions being added are valuable enough to be included based on the size of the transaction fee that use case is able to support. In general the blockchain is growing quickly and the developers are going to implement solutions to address this. Ultimately if Bitcoin is going to scale we need to address this issue.

To the second question of "polluting" the blockchain. The intension is not to do this. No one wants to fill up the blockchain will fake transactions that don't provide value. I think there are ways the Mastercoin protocol can be properly implemented that will address this concern.
As for the "donator" you are correct. They are taking a risk and positing that there will be a positive utility for the features Mastercoin proposes to implement and those developers involved will be able to implement them in a heathy way. If this proves not to be true than the "donator's" Mastercoins will not have any value. Only time will tell the tale.

The Bit Angels are ready to take applications from Startups in the Bitcoin eco-system. Fill out the survey so your startup can join the screening and due diligence process.
Lots of applications already through the Bit Angels website. 
Specifically the Bit Angels have expressed interest in funding companies who can accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin. New parts of the eco-system that can accomplish this include:
Color Coins, Escrow, Bitcoin In Developing Nations, Bitcoin Wallets for the Masses, Peer to Peer Mining Tech, Hardware Wallet Companies, Friendly Jurisdictions, Other blockchain and crypto tech in early stages.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:34:35
It took me a while to wrap my head around that too. As I've come to understand there is a lot of value to having a sub set of Bitcoins associated with particular features that are developed. By using the MSC to send value you are supporting the developers building that feature. So it serves a role similar to that of the value of Bitcoins supporting the developers and community to continue producing awesome improvements to the protocol. By separating the two you offer different markets prices for different features. 
So for example if someone set up an insurance protocol on top of Bitcoin and you had to use the InsureCoin to use the service then that would create an incentive and market price for that service separate from underlying Bitcoin. Once you think of it in those terms it starts to come together why people will want to use and buy MSC to utilize its features, just as people must buy and use BTC to send value cross the globe instantly.

This is a big win for the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
We get a major online retailer like Overstock.com on board with Bitcoin and it will put real competitive pressure on other online retailers.
Especially if they offer a discount to use Bitcoins. 
Great quotes by their CEO too.
Patrick Byrne "Money is too important to leave in the hands of government officials,” 
Patrick Byrne added that ”the long-run value of all fiat currencies goes to zero.”
I think the Bitcoin community is going to like this guy : )

TLDR, Bit Angel Website and sub Reddit launched. Join us.  Pic of first meeting:  New Website Address: 
The Bit Angels website and sub Reddit is the culmination of a pretty amazing experience at the 2013 Bitcoin Conference. By the end of Saturday night there were a critical mass of veteran entrepreneurs and angel investors at the conference and a real desire by everyone to gather together to discuss the most compelling companies in the space and to explore ways to accelerate those companies.
Sunday morning I hacked together the first Bit Angels website, made a post on Reddit about a 12:00 noon meeting ( and a quick announcement at the conference about doing a first meeting of the Bit Angels. I invited 6 people and more than 20 showed up to the first meeting. Now more than 35 people have joined the group as of this posting. I've volunteered to be the Executive Director and things are moving fast. If you are an experienced entrepreneur and have a few BTC to invest come join us.
Here are a few guidelines the Bit Angels discussed at the first meeting: Discussion of companies which we can accelerate by investing our social, financial, and intellectual capital in.
Community Guidelines: Consider companies that strengthen the Bitcoin / digital currency eco-system. Focus on early stage companies. Focus on companies that can out perform the appreciation of Bitcoin or will directly lead to its appreciation. Gentlemen's agreement to go pro-rata on deals that go through the Bit Angel application, screening, presentation, and due diligence process. Invest equal parts sweat equity and financial capital. Meaning invest your time, skills, and experience in the Bit Angel startup entrepreneurs not just your BTC.

Agreed. When the XRP begin to be released the price will be pretty close to zero given the 100 Billion ultimately available.
Here is my quick back of the napkin type analysis of the price of Ripple / XRP. While I think Ripple is a good concept and it has promise to be a valuable company one day, a startup in their stage of development (working Beta) is worth between $2 Million and $10 Million depending on their team, traction, and underlying technology. Assuming the high side of the valuation range of $10 Million, a buyer would be offering 1 BTC for 242,262 XRP / Ripples assuming a $10 Million US valuation for the network (100 Billion) as a whole. Just my two cents. (From someone who has been starting and selling software companies for 11 years). -DJohnston

Want to know more about the Open Source Mastercoin Project, just visit: 
Official Rules of the Distributed Exchange Coding Bounty
* item 1 ALL serious entries will win a prize (although some prizes may be very small)
* item 2 Prize money will be divided up with input from the community and the board of the MasterCoin Foundation, based primarily on how useful and valuable your code is to accomplishing the goals of the contest
* item 3 In addition to the overall impact and value of your code, other important things will be taken under consideration: How often you post updates in this thread. Ideally, you should post what you plan to do, and then post extremely frequent updates as you make progress.
* item 4 Ease of use and testability. If you just dump some source code on me at the end of the contest with a bunch of grandiose claims, you may not get much. Ideally, you should be posting demos, screenshots, and/or set up a website demonstrating your code.
* item 5 Collaboration. If you are helping other people working on MasterCoin projects, that will weigh favorably on how much you win. If you release your source code early and other people build on it, that will weigh even more favorably.
* item 6 Note that contest contestants will give me feedback on each other, and that feedback will be heavily considered when making payouts (so be nice to each other!)
* item 7 If somebody forks your code, and builds on it, you will get some consideration at payout time, even if you did nothing in the current contest.
* item 8 Breaking new ground, or being redundant. Doing something new is awesome, but you will NOT be penalized for implementing the same thing as someone else. We need redundancy for cross-checking.
* item 9 Only open-source projects will be considered for a prize. You must release your source code before the end of the contest to be eligible.
* item 10 Getting the biggest prize in this contest does NOT guarantee you a job, but having some kind of entry in this contest will help your chances a lot.
* item 11 Contest ends once all acceptance criteria have been met (see below), with prizes paid out once the dust settles.
* item 12 Prizes will total 300 BTC, regardless of the current price of bitcoins
* item 13 200 BTC will be split up among contributing developers
* item 14 100 BTC will be split up among anybody who helped by doing code reviews, testing, and bug reporting (this may be the same people as the developers, or different people)
* item 15 Contestants may elect to take some or all of their prize money in MasterCoins if desired. (We'll purchase them on the open market for you, using the bitcoins we would have paid you)
Acceptance criteria:
* item 1 Minimum one PC wallet (for both Linux and Windows) which can generate simple sends and the buy/sell messages required for the distributed exchange, using agree-upon multisig format
* item 2 Minimum two websites parsing such messages, and the resulting balance transfers
* item 3 Minimum one website showing BTC/MSC price charts derived from these messages
* item 4 Minimum 10 days of real-world usage with no major problems
* item 5 High bar for usability. (Current heavy traders like maxmint, lishbtc, and buymastercoin should be happy with the final product, if at all possible).

To quote a smart technical guy I know: 
"Mastercoin will solve the exchange issue regarding trading CFDs (contracts for difference) of BTC/XAU (bitcoin/gold) 
However theres an exchange where you can trade Bitcoin CFDs (plus500.com), so if you wanted to buy Bitcoin and sell Gold, long BTC, short XAU. CFDs are akin to NDF (non deliverable forwards) that are continuously rolling and don't have expiration date.
Physical delivery exchange of gold via BTC is difficult in non-formal markets because golds fungibility is affected due to having to have the right expertise and tools to know if the gold is real or not, but not impossible, many informal gold markets where I live and traders know coins very well, although bars have to go extensive checking to avoid the infamous tungsten-filled bars."

Mastercoin is an open source community building advanced features (often called Colored Coins) on top of the Bitcoin Blockchain. So for example you want to trade Bitcoins for Litecoins, well Mastercoins lets you do that with the block chain are the third party matching the offers. You would make an offer in a Bitcoin transaction in a special way supported by the Mastercoins application and if someone matched your offer then the blockchain would complete transaction. No third party exchange required. See the protocol for details -

I look forward to your reply. I'm hoping we can develop common language so we know exactly what we are debating. Here is a short quote from the White Paper I'm working on, let me know if you think these are helpful categories.
"Type I, Type II and Type III Autonomous Applications
There is vigorous and often heated debate about how these AA’s should be structured, how their tokens ought to be distributed or not distributed (both from an ethical and utilitarian perspective). Allow me here to offer some simple categories to hopefully improve the way we debate these issues in the future. That way there is common language about if we are debating about the type of AA or the particular implementation / protocol of an AA.
Type I AA’s
Let us consider Bitcoin the baseline Type I AA and agree that other similar AA’s are based on their own blockchain. Bitshare, BitMessage and many other excellent projects can be included in this category.
Type II AA’s
Let us consider the open source Colored Coin project a Type II AA and agree that other similar AA’s are based on an existing blockchain, but do not have tokens of their own.
Type III AA’s
Let us consider the open source Mastercoin project a Type III AA and agree that other similar AA’s are based on an existing blockchain, and also have tokens of their own."

Speaking of which did you see the new Mastercoin Protocol website: Mastercoin.org There is already a thin client in development, a website to buy and sell the MSC and a block chain explorer. Plus a $25,000 USD coding contest going on for implementations of the protocol.  Not bad for 28 days after it was launched.

True. But so does that Bitcoin Foundation. They take in member fees pay Gavin's salary (core developer / chief data scientist) and generally promote Bitcoin. That isn't to say they control Bitcoin and they certainly don't have the power to issue more Bitcoins or change the protocol in a way the community doesn't want. Same thing here, if people like the proposed tools and want to support them, then great they can donate. If not that's ok its totally opt in. If something better comes along than people will use that, I'll let the market decide.

I'm using "compounding interest" as a general term / analogous to a growth rate compounding over time to create exponential growth in a system. 
For example, yes we are starting from a small base I'll grant you, but the BitPay growth curve in the link you listed above looked pretty robust to me. Nearly 250% growth in three months doesn't sound too bad to me (15,000 transactions in September to nearly 60,000 transactions in November). And thus my comment about compounding interest. 
Actually one of my favorite quotes is from Einstein on this topic "Albert Einstein once declared compound interest to be "the most powerful force in the universe." 
Though Snopes.com questions if Einstein said it, as the first appearance of the quote in print doesn't appear until after his death in 1955.

If we pick a day that corresponds to the day of their announcement then we could piggy back on that announcement right at the same time that the Tech world has its eyes focused on SXSW and get an added boost for  /  announcement.

Thanks for sharing your experiences. Personally I've only had good experiences with Coinbase. I've had an account for more than 30 days so maybe that helps. I read a thread a couple of days ago... went and searched for it. Here it is: 
In which Fred basically explains that given the number of transactions Coinbase has to rely on an algorithm and that they are improving it as fast as they can.
And I believe them. I've built a number of software companies and it takes time to get a stable, reliable and scalable system in place. 
The more important question than "Does their system have bugs?" (which everyone's software does) is the question of "Is their system getting better and better over time? (which I think it is) and when there is an issue, "Is it easy to contact them and do they resolve the issue quickly?"
That's my two BTC millicents on the topic. - DJohnston

I respect Mike Hearn a lot. Though the criticism he levels is basically that the project is early stage, it has a lot of work to prove itself via real code, and that he hopes the money is managed properly. I think those are all fair points, and all true. The protocol is early stage, the code is early stage, and the money does need to be managed well. And....   I don't think that equals that the Mastercoin project shouldn't develop the spec as best it can, develop the code as best it can, and have complete transparency about how funds are used.
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:31:16
1. Gavin has indeed commented on one aspect of the spec regarding to putting fake transactions into the blockchain as a method of recording data. "There are better ways of doing what you want to do." And for the record I agree with him and so does J.R. there are three or four methods to accomplish this feature. 
2. Correct. Its a paper, some good research, and around 500 Bitcoiners (those that have donated), that want these features to happen and now around $500,000 in funding to get there. Very early stage, no doubt.
3. The author did say, and has been saying for a while, (see video link  ) that he is passionate about this, will invest in it, and will spend some hours on it, but he isn't the ideal person to be the lead developer. So the forum is open for nominations of a technically minded lead developer / data scientist. If you have one in mind then PM me.
As for being risky, absolutely. As being early stage, absolutely. If those things turn you off, please don't take part in it.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:58:28
I look forward to your thoughts. I hope you will frame them with the assumption that you are indeed coupling the functions of the application with a coin.

There is a similar que at Coinbase if you consider that new accounts can only purchase up to 10 BTC per day. It is only 30 days AFTER completing your first BTC purchase through Coinbase, that your account's buying limit is increased to 100 BTC per day. 
So consider any new Coinbase accounts created in the last 30 days that wishes to purchase more than 10 BTC per day also represents pent up demand.
This may continue to put additional short term pressure on the price. Though for me the more interesting question is the longterm price expectation. Here is my detailed analysis from a past comment about the relationship between the number of transactions per day and the BTC price in USD:

I don't know why you are hostile to Mastercoin. The project has already paid out $100,000 + USD (in BTC and MSC) to developers working on the distributed exchange that works on top of the Bitcoin network. Its implementing a distributed Proof of Stake system for community consensus and its all open sourced. Translation, people are building you free open source tools that add value to the blockchain. Colored Coins, Open Transactions, are great too for particular feature sets and they are open source too. Is it because it uses a "coin" to power the features? That's the basis of bitcoin also.

Cross posted from Mises.org Discussion of the Article and Reddit.com_____________________________
In response to the term "alt coin".
When most people use the word "alt coin" they often mean one of two things. Either that the entity in question utilizes an "alternative" blockchain or that the entity in question is acting as an "alternative" to Bitcoin. In the case of Mastercoin neither of these definitions fit and thus I don't think "alt coin" is a really useful term here in the context of Master Protocol / Mastercoin.
We may very well agree that most of the "alt coins" in the market will fail to gain sufficient market adoption and thus sufficient network effect to compete with Bitcoin. That's all well and good, but that's not really the core of the "user currencies" feature of Mastercoin. The purpose of the features is to allow users to issue digital tokens that are recorded in the blockchain for a wide variety of purposes including being a smart property record for a car, house, stock, bond or contract.
For example I'm launching a new application that allows developers to access an API for email integration using IMAP / Exchange. I'm using Bitcoin Protocol / Master Protocol to issue the digital tokens that allow developers to access said application. I'm using Bitcoin via the Master Protocol as a back end service for time stamping, token record storage in the Bitcoin ledger, and a network for token transfer. None of my applications functions are competing with Bitcoin and the primary purpose of the application has nothing to do with "coins or currency", thats why I prefer the language of "digital token".
I've written an entire white paper on the concept of Decentralized Applications using open source + tokens as a means of monetization if you are interested.
Response to the thoughts on Escrow Based Currencies
When I first started doing due diligence I was very skeptical about the Master Protocol / Mastercoin as well. This point about Escrow Backed User Currencies being flawed has been brought up time and time again. However what I decided in the end, is that this is a moot point.
Firstly, I'd point out this feature is NOT enabled in the current implementations or even in the Spec. See Unlocking Features section of the Spec here: 
So given its an advanced feature that isn't enabled, even in the spec, this argument is akin to saying "Bitcoin is flawed because the advanced scripting features are impossible to implement securely." This would be a moot point, the scripting features in Bitcoin are dis-abled because the complex security edge cases around them haven't been fully understood. That does not change the underlying value of the payment network or store of value utilities of the Bitcoin Protocol / bitcoins.
Second, the Master Protocol is at a very early stage and you are welcome to suggest better methods of implementing certain features. In fact some of Master Protocol's early critics and now contributors such as Bitcoin Magazine's Vitalik Buterin suggested "Contract for Difference" as a best established method for implementing the goal of Escrow Back Currencies ( Given this is an open source project J.R. and the other developers agreed this was a much better suggestion and now CFD's are in the official spec. See: 
Even now, you are in the process, with this very article and these very comments, of improving the Master Protocol and increasing the odds of its success. For example you just suggested leveraging Justus' bitcoin backed surety bonds to promote honesty. Great suggestion! I in fact know Justus (I saw him just last week) and I'll be sure to read the link you just posted. And guess what, if it makes sense in the context of the Master Protocol, then I'll be making a pull request to the Mastercoin Spec on Github myself in order to include it soon.

There are a lot of ways to contribute the eco-system with out being a programmer and picking up some of the Reward Mastercoins. Just as one can participate in the Bitcoin eco-system without being a programmer or one of the developers. The distributed exchange, distributed commerce, distributed smart property are features everyone can benefit from and use.
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:46:44
1. Last time I checked Mastercoin had a variety of developers. Like the ones who won the recent coding competition. Developers are welcome to join the effort and improve the way it is being implemented. Its all open source, come and join the effort.
2. As for exploiting the hashing power of Bitcoin, would you say the same about Satoshi Dice or anyone else paying transaction fees to send information through the blockchain? In my view the blockchain is neutral to transaction types. If Mastercoin creates great new reasons to send different types of transactions on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, how does that not increase demand for Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:47:21
Last time I checked the Mastercoin distribution was controlled by the protocol and the distributed clients that implement it. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:46:10
Thanks for your reply. Yes I'm involved in Mastercoin, thats pretty much public record on both the Forums and here on Reddit so no real secret there.
Rather than re-state them all here, I would point you to the 10 Misconceptions about Mastercoin which I wrote earlier and posted to the Bitcointalk forums. 
I like your passion and I've already stated I like Colored Coins. I just still don't get your hostility, quote "screw Mastercoin" to this open source project. 
I read your text and understand where you are coming from, but that fact is the Mastercoin model has its own coin, which yes does allow for people to be rewarded for things like contributing to the code (See Dev Mastercoins) and funding the features and so forth. I'm convinced that this ownership model is closer to that of Bitcoin, where I'm rewarded for providing computational power to the network and so forth.
I'm just asking for a more professional manor here, we are all working toward the same goal of a decentralized infrastructure and many of us work on many of the same projects together, no need to go around name calling other projects. You have your favorite project, great more power to you brother, just no need to degrade others.
@_date: 2013-08-31 22:35:43
Gigitrix, 
Thanks for the details on your point of view and for digging into the spec. You are correct there is a good deal of attention paid to the issuance of the Mastercoins and to the question of if they will have a value. For any project to succeed it needs to have a form of monetization to support its longterm sustainability. For example in the BTC community we all pay attention to the price of BTC because those that hold it, have a stake in its outcome.
I have no objection to the Mastercoin Protocol creating a similar "stake in the outcome" for a community of users that want to see these more advanced features fully developed in the near term as a protocol on top of Bitcoins.
To your point about "Reward Mastercoins", I understand your concern and share it. I want this to be done right, to be as fully decentralized as possible. With that said I see why J.R. created these coins to offer a continuing incentive, (but diminishing percentage of the coins over time) for developers who contribute to the building of these features.
The main issue is really around "who" controls the distribution of this what amounts to 10% of the Mastercoins. And "who" distributes these coins from the Exodus Address to the developers. To be done right, it must be done transparently and with the community of users leading it as much as possible. Hence a Foundation and not J.R. just making sole decisions. Also making all those decisions public before they are executed. Just as has been done with the publishing of the white paper and proposing it to the community, that type of approach has to continue. 
My friend I wish there were a fully distributed way to execute these functions (and hopefully there will be soon) and we could let the blockchain enforce it, but we do not yet have the tools to do so, given there isn't any mining (the most elegant solution thus far) that needs to be done in this particular application. With that in mind, I think this is a logical, though imperfect solution for this application.
Thanks again for your input. These dialog is extremely important.

@_date: 2013-11-29 21:48:21
Thanks. Agreed. The funny thing is despite the aggressive approach, Alex / Killerstorm has some good points and given Mastercoin is an open source project many of his suggestions are likely to be implemented by the Devs, thus ultimately increasing the odds of Mastercoin's success as a functioning Decentralized Application. That's the beauty of open source projects : ) Criticisms lead to bug fixes almost instantly. 
**Edit: I'm glad to say that all of the security issues brought up in this post (versioning, disabling advanced features, verification, better testing) have now been addressed in the latest version of the Mastercoin Protocol. See: 
I've been emailing back and forth with Alex / Killerstorm and his input boils down to:
Alex: 
* item 1. "Disable everything except simple send and decentralized exchange. As few as possible features need to be enabled."
Me: That makes sense, the Mastercoin clients basically already do this, but it would be good to reflect it in the spec / appendix to be crystal clear.
**Edit: This has now been implemented in the Mastercoin protocol: 
* item 2. If possible, restrict decentralized exchange
Me: The Mastercoin clients already restrict the Decentralized Exchange to just Test MSC, we should look at his specific thoughts about watching for differences in implementations.
* item 3. Compartmentalize distributed exchange feature: people should be able to tell whether coins came to them only through simple sends, or whether decentralized exchange was involved. paranoid people would want coins of the first kind.
Me: This is interesting, I'll have to look at it more closely.
* item 4. Introduce a notion of a reference implementation, say, Tachikoma's one. if people disagree about how to implement the spec, they should look into how it is implemented in the reference one. (This is how it works for Bitcoin: Satoshi's implementation is the reference, and people who make other implementations had to read its source code.)
Me: This is actually already under consideration and is being developed on the Bitcointalk thread. 
**Edit: The Mastercoin developers are actively working on a reference implementation see the discussion thread here: 
* item 5. Make it versioned. Say, current rules are guaranteed to be valid until block 300000. At that point old version of unstalable clients will stop and ask user to upgrade. This way you can enable more and more features gradually without compromising the security.
Me: I'll have to think about it, but this makes sense to me at first past.
**Edit: This has now been implemented into the Mastercoin Protocol.
So thanks for the input Alex. You know next time you can just drop me an email, I take security issues around Mastercoin very seriously.

* item 1.  Minimum one PC wallet (for both Linux and Windows) which can generate simple sends and the buy/sell messages required for the distributed exchange, using agree-upon multisig format
* item 2. Minimum two websites parsing such messages, and the resulting balance transfers
* item 3. Minimum one website showing BTC/MSC price charts derived from these messages
* item 4. Minimum 10 days of real-world usage with no major problems
* item 5. High bar for usability. (Current heavy traders like maxmint, lishbtc, and buymastercoin should be happy with the final product, if at all possible)

Dolewhip, Yes, thanks for the link. That is the "accredited" he was asking about. Specifically on being Accredited, no that is not required to be a member of the Bit Angels. Angel List and others require you be an accredited investor because they don't want to deal with the extra paperwork (Private Placement Memorandums and such) that come along with partnering with unaccredited investors. The current Regulation D allows for up to 35 unaccredited investors to participate in a private placement offer, though the new "Jobs Act" is changing some of the rules around public disclosure around private fund raising efforts and how many unaccredited investors can participate (removing the cap, but with many restrictions).

Edit - Well now there is a open market of sorts (based on ThePiachu's offer for 1,000 XRP on Bitmit) and it appears I'm offering way too much BTC for XRP. A good point is that there are 100 Billion Ripples and if I were to make the offer of 1BTC for 7,450 XRP I'd be valuing the Ripple network at 322.5 Million USD. While I think Ripple is a good concept and it has promise to be a valuable company one day, a start up in their stage of development (working Beta) is worth between $2 Million and $10 Million depending on their team, traction, and underlying technology. Assuming the high side of the valuation range of $10 Million I should be offering 32.25 times less at a fair market valuation of the Ripple Network. In other words 0.031 BTC for the 7,450 XRP. Or to make the numbers easy for Bitcoiners: 1 BTC is may be worth 242,262 XRP assuming a $10 Million US valuation for the market as a whole.  Just my two cents.

Also you do know that the "Mastercoin Foundation is entitled to extract ~1.2 cents from the marker output in every transaction in perpetuity". Is no other correct right? That's pretty far out of date.
That was back in the earlier days when the protocol used fake transactions to record data in the blockchain. That's all being replaced thanks to the 0.9 Provably Prune able Outs as detailed in Gavin's recent update on the Bitcoin Foundation blog. Search the Bitcointalk forums for Class A, Class B and Class C Transactions. Class C transactions (the preferred method) uses the provably prune able outputs.
See: 
This is REALLY important to understand, because now there is a way to store Meta data in the Bitcoin blockchain that won't either bloat or pollute the blockchain with transactions that nodes don't want to store. Those transactions are now "provably prune able outputs" and can be stored on achieve nodes. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:55:23
Thanks for passing along the numbers. In my own analysis I find BTC to be fairly valued at the current $29 to $32 range. 
I'm using a bottom up analysis based on a relationship between the number of transactions per day and the BTC price in USD. This relationship seems logical given the number of transactions, while diverse represents the utility of BTC, that is to say: the ability of BTC to transfer payments to other people. 
In my analysis it seems that the primary driving factor for the price of USD per BTC is growth in transactions. There appears to be a direct and quantifiable relationship between the number of BTC transactions processed each day to the price of BTC in USD. 
Consider on January 1st 2011 there were 659 transactions per day and the price per BTC was $0.30 USD. The resulting ratio if you divide the transactions by the price is 2,197. A few days ago (February 23rd 2013) there were 62,748 transactions and the price was $29.11 USD. Resulting in a nearly unchanged ratio of 2,156. 
The ratio has fluctuated over time from a low of 616 on August 1st 2011, and a high of 5,166 on June 1st 2012 when BTC were over valued and undervalued respectively. However the fair market value over time seems to return to the 1,800 to 2,300 range.
I will be interested to see if this relationship holds into the future as it has the last 2+ years. If so I'm calling it the "BTC Transactions To Price Effect (or perhaps the "BTC Transactions To Price Ratio" would convey the idea more easily).
The usefulness of this effect lets us observe transactions per day and gauge if the market is over valuing, under valuing or offering fair market value for BTC.

Edit - Here is a link to the graph I made of the observed ratio from January 1st 2011 to February 1st 2013

SXSW is traditionally the launching point for new disruptive technologies. Twitter, Foursquare and many others have launched their application at the SXSW Interactive conference. 
With this in mind, I've organized a number of software startups to announce at SXSW that they will now be accepting BTC for their website's services. Bitcoin being a new disruptive technology itself.
Wisard said it well, "I doubt is big enough to pull this off without an external stimulus. A better idea maybe to wait for some sort of controversy or news and then tag along with it."
Therefore lets use SXSW as that External Stimulus and timed "event" on which to all focus our Tweeting efforts to get  ranked on Twitter's trending topics. 
I also like the idea of having a "Bitcoin Day" but if we pick say Jan. 12th, then we have to wait most of the year to do this. I like idea of everyone ordering Pizza with BTC idea too and lets plan on that being the next event we get  trending on.

Here are the notes from the first 2013 Bit Angel Group meeting.
The group defined itself as:
"A distributed group of Entrepreneurs and Angel Investors partnering with and funding seed stage startups in the digital currency eco-system."
The group explored areas of the Bitcoin eco-system that are in development, but not yet commercialized or scaled.
Color Coins (shares, bonds, etc...) that can be issued off chain and merged with the Bitcoin blockchain open ledger - Due Diligence Group Formed.
Escrow - Leveraging reputation systems, multi-party signatures functions, and a trusted party to enable a scalable escrow system - Due Diligence Group Formed.  
Bitcoin In Developing Nation - Text message based system for Bitcoin - Feature phone capable Bitcoin systems. - Due Diligence Group Formed.
Bitcoin Wallet for the Masses - Facebook Transaction App - Send Bitcoin via Twitter - Send Bitcoin via App.Net - Due Diligence Group Formed.
Peer to Peer Mining / More advanced 26 nm Chipsets - Order of magnitude improvements still possible. Queuing technology. Ect... - Due Diligence Group Formed.
Hardware Wallet Companies - Tech to make securely storing BTC for the masses. - Due Diligence Group Formed.
Entrepreneurs and investors interested in joining the Bit Angel group can send me an email by clicking the "Join Us" button on 
I'll also open a sub-reddit for the Bit Angel group.
Talk with you soon.

Spiral you are just restating Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD). You know for a fact the things you are stating aren't correct. 
1. Yes, J.R. wrote the protocol, but anyone was able to participate in the Exodus Address.
2. Yes the code can be copied thats the nature of open source. However no one is going to copy the Mastercoin network effect, any more than Feathercoin is going to copy of the Network effect of Bitcoin.
3. J.R. does not in fact hold all the Exodus Funds, right now they have been distributed among the Mastercoin Foundation Board members to remove a central point of failure, and as you know the Distributed Bounty / Proof of Stake system will allow for their distribution in a completely decentralized way. 
You know I covered this and many other misconceptions in my post on Bitcointalk

themaka, Fair enough. Any conference is positive on its own industry. However it wasn't what people were talking about that moved me, it was what they were actually doing that was so encouraging. I went into the conference with an awareness of half a dozen gaps in the Bitcoin ecosystem and while there, I was pleasantly surprised to find all the gaps had been filled very recently. For example I now have what amounts to a Bitcoin Powered Debit Card / Master Card in the mail to arrive next week (signed up at the conference), I have the ability to send Bitcoin via SMS, Email, Twitter and Facebook through multiple competing companies. Through GYFT I can buy most anything retail with BTC, with Bill Pay For Coins I can pay any Bill with BTC. All combined the utility of BTC is sky rocketing. I realized the day in which I can live 100% on BTC both earning and spending my BTC inside the Bitcoin economy isn't 3 or 4 years away its just 6 months away. By the end of the year we will be there. That was a powerful realization, and it fueled BitAngels to originally form and want to be part of accelerating all those new services. Now less then 30 days later 100+ have joined the effort and we are close to funding a number of important new companies in the ecosystem. Its accelerating much faster than I think most people realize even inside this community. Think back just 6 months ago before the world heard of Bitcoin during the Cyprus crisis. We have come so far in such a short amount of time.

Yes, thats what I thought at first too. Alt coins can be interesting test beds for new blockchain tech, but I haven't seen a very compelling one yet, I'm 100% Bitcoin at the moment. Though when I dug into Mastercoin and realized that it was being built on top of the existing Bitcoin blockchain and intending to act like a new layer, similar to HTTP on top of the TCP-IP layer of the internet that got me interested. The other thing I investigated was how the Coins were produced. I'm not a fan of pre-mined alt coins, and so I was happy to see that there was no central authority for Mastercoin and instead the coins are fairly issued to anyone who donates to the "Exodus Address" before the deadline. Plus the pool of Reward Mastercoins for developer bounties I think is a smart idea as well. Given mining isn't possible for this application I believe this is a more logical approach is distributing coins, vs. pre-mining.

Ladies and Gentlemen, 
And this is what a spike looks like. As much as I'm bullish on the long term value of BTC, the current price is beginning to out pace the fundamental value of the number of transactions per day (the actual utility of BTC). If the historical ratio of 2,000 transactions per day to $1 USD in value is any measure, then BTC has become slightly overvalued. 60,000 transactions divided by $39.50 is 1,518 so roughly 25% over valued at the moment. There have been long periods when BTC was under valued and long periods when it was over valued so I don't claim to know if a correction will come sooner or later, or if the growth rate in transactions will catch up to this new price, but for what it is worth that is my two BTC cents : ) Here is a link to my previous comment and bottom up analysis of the relationship between transactions and BTC price over time.

Again with the misconceptions. You don't have to Buy them, you can earn them by providing value to the network. There are a ton of bounties being posted for all types of coding, and non coding activities to add value to the network. Miners provide electricity to the Bitcoin network and get bitcoins, why shouldn't developers provide code and get Mastercoins?
This is all public record you can see exactly how many Dev Mastercoins are available and its all controlled mathematically by the Mastercoin protocol. 
Soon there will be a Proof of Stake and the community can all vote on what Features are most important, how much to reward activities, and what gets into the protocol,
There are 6,000 Dev coins already generated right now that will be handed out to the winners of the bounties. That's $600,000 of MSC at current prices (0.25 BTC to 1 MSC) being handed out to Developers soon. The protocol calls for 50% of the Dev Mastercoins to be generated the first year, 25% the second, 12.5% the third and so forth. Its a pretty simple and elegant distribution curve if you ask me.

Correct. Investors trading the shares in this private Bitcoin Investment Trust will drive the price up or down based on how bullish or bearish they are on the future of Bitcoin. So the price of the "BIT" shares will be seen as a signal to traders on the exchanges and vice a versa, if over time more and more volume is traded on the "Bit" shares than the signal will grow in strength as compared to the price signal from the exchanges.

I wish you would revisit the Mastercoin Spec. 
**Edit: All of the security issues brought up in this post (versioning, disabling advanced features, verification, better testing) have now been addressed in the latest version of the Mastercoin Protocol. See: 
**Also Peter Todd (a well know Bitcoin developer) has recently joined the Mastercoin Foundation in a full time role as "Chief Scientist" to explore for any attack vectors against the Mastercoin Protocol or its implementations  This is a good move in the right direction.**
Many people had similar concerns about the mechanism for Escrow Back Currencies. Since then the Spec has been updated to include "Contracts for a Difference". A "Contract for Difference" (CFD) allows a bettor to temporarily gain bullish or bearish exposure to a price movement, in direct proportion to that movement.
Contracts for a Difference is a fairly well established mechanism for accomplishing virtually the same thing as the originally suggested Escrow Back Currencies Mechanism. 
As for "steering a dangerous course with people's money" I'd point out, A. That J.R. put a lot of his own money on the line for this project and thus is putting his money where his mouth is. B. That everyone who participated in the Exodus Address funding period was aware of the specification C. That the valuation since then has been driven by the market as people watch Mastercoin's development on the Dev Thread and the updates to the Spec.

Spiral Mind you are back, I missed you : )
Same old sayings, I've come to know and love.
But come on buddy you know full well this isn't an Alternative Block Chain Project and so there isn't and can't be any mining. Its a segment of Bitcoins set aside (by ANYONE who took part in the Exodus Address) for the development of a particular set of advanced features.
Second, I'm not sure what you mean by "if he ever does release the code" its all on open source on Github my friend. You are welcome to come contribute to the code base of the Mastercoin Protocol this very day. ( see Github links)
Third, just because J.R. set up the Exodus Address you should know from reading the white paper that doesn't give him any "central" power over the use of Mastercoins, any more than Satoshi got "central" power from setting up the Genesis block and writing the BTC white paper. Its just a reference point for the protocol and clients.
Forth, J.R. did not set up the Mastercoin Foundation. That was the suggestion of many of the Bitcoiners who participated in the Exodus Address (the Incorporation as a Non-Project has just recently been completed by a volunteer on the project's Board) as a way to provide for over sight and transparency in these coding competitions and the spending of project funds from the Exodus Address. 
Enjoy the weekend my friend. Its good weather. Have a barbecue or something to relax.

Plus I've already tied my name to the "Johnston Systems Competition Hypothesis" which I'll have to post on the Libertarian sub-reddit one of these days.
As for your suggestion, yes I do believe the rate of change in BTC transactions can be a leading indictor, however I'd say only in a very loose way and over a longer period of time. Take for example the big increase (more than 300%) in transactions from mid April to mid May of 2012, it took until mid August of 2012 for the price to respond with a 200% increase. And with additional increases in transaction volume it wasn't until January and February of 2013 that the price got back in balance with the historical average ratio range of 1,800 to 2,300.

@_date: 2013-08-31 19:40:03
I see your point. But my understanding is this is a new protocol layer on top of the Bitcoin Protocol. So it doesn't change the underlying Bitcoin layer, but adds tools on top. J.R. the guy who started it has invested a lot of his own dollars in it, so if it doesn't work then he doesn't gain anything. The funds are going to be control not by him, but by the Mastercoin non-profit foundation of which he is only 1 of 5 board members. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 03:37:07
Actually Mastercoin is already developing a market price as people are buying and selling them as what ever price they want. It isn't hedged or pegged to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-01 00:11:02
Again we are in agreement that mining is indeed the ideal form of distribution. With that said we have a particular application here that is built on the existing Bitcoin blockchain and not an alternative blockchain, thus mining is not an option open to us. 
Therefore the question becomes what is the best non-mining option? There are plenty of potential answers (some better than others), random distribution, give aways, distribution for tech development or business development. I think J.R. sincerely believes that this mixed approach of offering them Kickstarter style to those that support the features + a small pool for tech dev and bus dev purposes is a logical solution. And I agree with that conclusion. 
As to the scam issue again I'd say that someone has to benefit from a scam for it to make sense. Well here is a guy (J.R.) that put up a $100K plus of his own BTC because he believes in this effort. As has been pointed out below he isn't going to get back those dollars back as a salary, but instead those BTC will go to developers and so I'm not sure how he is benefiting unless he sincerely believes the project will have utility. 
And your point is well taken. If the market decides there isn't utility in the project than the funds put to this purpose will not generate a great outcome. 
I'll be sure and work to see these funds are spent transparently and cash efficiently, because yes you can count me among the people who supports this effort. 
Thanks again for all your input.

For those that haven't taken the technical dive yet here is the link to the white paper: 
Here also is the video link to J.R. the core developer talking at the Bitcoin conference in San Jose: 
TLDR, 
Its a project to develop a protocol layer on top of the Bitcoin block chain to enable peer to peer exchange, futures trading, and issuing new currencies and more. The funds are going to be used by the Mastercoin Foundation to offer bounties for the development of these more advanced features. All the "Mastercoins" that will ever be in existence will be created by the donations that come into the "Exodus Address" before August 31st at 12 midnight UTC / GMT. The Mastercoin protocol also automatically sets aside a 10% pool of the Mastercoins called "Reward Mastercoins" to incentivize  developers who help build these advanced features.     
NOOBIES BEWARE: Do not attempt to purchase MasterCoins with a web wallet (YOU COULD LOSE YOUR MONEY). You must use a wallet where you can control the sending address by sending all your funds to that address first, then purchasing MasterCoins with that address. (edit: Ripper pointed out that BlockChain.info wallet should work)  (full instructions:  )

You should really check out the Blue Seed project. 
They are working to launch a Visa Free Technology Incubator on a cruise ship housing 1,000 entrepreneurs 13 miles off the coast of Silicon Valley / Bay Area (international waters). The team has some class A Angel investors including Peter Thiel and just raised a $500K funding round to do the initial development.
If you are a serious big money Bitcoin Angel or others on this thread who are you can check out their Angel List page at: 
They will need to raise $10 to $30 million USD by 2014 to purchase the cruise ship get it in place and launch the incubator. They already have 1,000 plus entrepreneurs from around the world signed up and a great advisory team. I'm sure the CEO Max Marty is open to Bitcoin being used on the Blueseed. If anyone wants an introduction let me know I know him and his team personally and in fact I'll invite him to the Bitcoin Conference in May.
@_date: 2013-10-26 04:15:23
Do I consider that the "Mastercoin distribution was a decentralized, neutral minting process." Yes. That is indeed what I'm saying. 1. Anyone could "mint / generate" Mastercoins as described in the protocol. 2. The process was widely known in the Bitcoin community (via discussion on Reddit, Bitcoin Talk, and in Bitcoin Press). Without the need for mining what better method would there have been?
I'm not sure what the alternative would have been in this case to having a single entity create the Exodus Address. Perhaps a committee, collective, co-op, or a company?
I'll willingly agree that the distribution method between Bitcoin and Mastercoin has been different. One is mining based and the other was Kick Starter style. But again I think that is mainly due to the different requirements of the protocol. The Bitcoin network needs mining for security and scale. Mastercoin needed a limited and particular segment of Bitcoins as a reference point for features of the Mastercoin protocol. 
As for the length of time, in truth J.R. has been proposing this protocol and earlier versions of the Mastercoin Protocol since January of 2012.  See link. And what is he calling for in his comments in that thread? "Who is going to do this?" In May 2013 at the San Jose convention he is on the "Future of Bitcoin" panel calling for "someone" to do this and he would be happy to help with funding the effort. No one stood up over that 18 month period and so in August 1st J.R. took on the role himself and launched the project. I have a lot of respect for him taking action and trying to build something useful for the community. 
As for his ownership level. Anyone else could have put up the same level of funding as J.R. but he is the biggest advocate and believer in this technology and so he has his ownership of Mastercoins paid for like everyone else.
As for distribution over time I'm not really worried about that. The power law curve will apply here to Mastercoin just as it does in Bitcoin. People can try and change the power law distribution if they like by hating on ASICs with Litecoin type implementations they believe will "evenly distribute" ownership. But the truth is the market always allows those that want to participate more highly and those that want to participate less to do their preferred behavior over time.
And in fact yes, J.R. has given away some of his personal Mastercoins on past and current Give Away threads on Bitcoin Talk. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:53:43
See this again is a misconception. "Mastercoin is much more centralized than more standard crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Primecoin". And the reason given is because it doesn't "earn coins by a neutral process of computational mining". Thats because it isn't another alternative blockchain, Mastercoin works on top of the Bitcoin protocol, their isn't any need for mining. You already have a blockchian. So given that reality. And if you were to design a coin that can't use mining, how would you do it? With Mastercoin you could generate them at the original Exodus Address in August, or earn Dev Mastercoins by contributing code to the Mastercoin code base. Both of these activities add value to the open source project. There is a free faucet too, if you want to test it out. I'm honestly asking, because no one has given me a answer yet. How would you better structure this system (without mining / because it isn't relevant here).
I'm going to write a write paper on this topic of this new breed of projects that operate on the existing blockchain's, but also have a coin to access their utility and functions. If you are genuinely interested, you can PM me and give me input on the white paper.

Spiral, Thanks for the comments and thoughts. You bring up valid points about concerns regarding control of the funds sent to the Exodus address. I've made a comment below to respond to that point, about how I believe a transparent Foundation Board is the best way to address that concern. As for the features I'd be interested in details on the technical challenges you see to their implementation. I would agree with you that some of the more advanced features such as the escrow will be technically difficult and may not pan out. With that said I see many of the proposed features as fairly straight forward from a technical perspective.
As for the number of people who start out with the initial distributions of coins (those that supported it), I would point out that all Bitcoins start with miners and at the beginning of Bitcoin there were a very small number of miners. From those miners people purchase Bitcoins and use them for their different functions (namely as a store of value or transfer of value over distance). Starting with 500 "Mastercoin miners" if you will, doesn't seem like a bad beginning. If the uses of Mastercoin prove to have utility people will seek to buy Mastercoins from those who have them and a market price will be established. And there will be the future distribution of Mastercoins (10% of those created today) to developers contributing to the protocol more will enter the market slowly and predictability over time.
Thanks again for your input. I'm eager to explore the weak points of this plan from a technical perspective so that the implementation can be done in the best way possible. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:44:49
Thanks for the notes. Let me address them simply by saying that so far Mastercoin has been (and is structured to be) a transparent, distributed and open source effort. A little more detail below.
1. "Sell" them would imply someone held them before they were "sold" (as in pre-minded them). In fact the MSC were generated when a Bitcoin user sent BTC to the Exodus address. No one controlled the amount created, who created them or set any limit on their creation, except the protocol detailed the dates between which they could be created, so that there would be a finite and scarce number of them. The effort was widely discussed on Reddit, Bitcoin Talk, Coin Desk and so forth.  
2. The first bounty was announced shortly after the Exodus Address effort concluded on the 31st of  August and was paid out to all those that worked on it. The Mastercoin Foundation may end up supporting a core Dev or two on salary (as the Bitcoin Foundation does), but first those core Devs have to emerge from those contributing code to the effort. Everyone in the last contest seemed very happy with the out come.
3. If you are saying Open Source is THE way to go, then I whole heartedly agree.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:19:09
Firstly, tokens in an application are not "equity". There is no Mastercoin company, no employees, no stock, no profits, no dividends, no incorporation. Its an open source protocol and open source project. Secondly, what you just described could be said about any startup ever, you have an idea, you gain supporters to fund its development and then you code up the best implementation you can.

Agreed. Colored Coins to me are the key.
Especially the ability to use the Bitcoin blockchain to enable a p2p decentralized exchange. Check out  
The Mastercoin Foundation is in the middle of its search for great entrepreneurs and technical devs to accelerate development. The project has funding and it putting out dev competitions and bounties.

I'm glad you are interested to see future developments. So am I.
As for J.R.'s role in writing the white paper and creating the Exodus address, that is plain fact and I'm not trying to "obscure" it. But that's different than implying that J.R. has "central" control of the project or that him creating the Exodus address is a bad thing. 
I'm not sure why a "single entity" being the spark is bad. Satoshi gave us a white paper and first blocks of the block chain. That didn't give him any future power over Bitcoin. Just because J.R. set up the Exodus Address that doesn't give him any "central" power over the use of Mastercoins, any more than Satoshi got "central" power from setting up the Genesis block and writing the BTC white paper. Its just a reference point for the protocol and clients.
Ultimately the market will judge if the features Mastercoin develops are fair and useful to people, then they will use it, if they are not than people will not use it. But I for one can't wait to do one of the first trades on a fully decentralized exchange with the block chain as my third party : )

You are not alone. I just managed to get one of those strange balances myself. I emailed Fred from Coinbase about it and they are normally pretty quick to reply. If it doesn't clear itself up by Monday, you should definitely shoot them an email from their Help Page: 
I see myself as a Bitcoin Beta Tester (given it is in Beta) so I try to report all bugs I find. The sooner we help knock out the bugs, the sooner BTC can be used by mainstream folks.

Edit- It appears this bug / or a similar / related bug has already been reported, see the Reddit thread on it here:

From what I hear Bank of America is the most accepting of Bitcoin thus far. I hear bad things about M&amp;T, Capital One, Wells Fargo, and Chase. Has anyone actually had an account shut down by Bank of America?

This is a question I've also wondered about. Obviously its impossible to know exactly how many BTC users exist, however I'd estimate there are currently between 5 and 7 million people world wide who either hold or use BTC (I'm going to define "active" very broadly as both those who are using BTC as a store of wealth and those who are using it as a currency / payment mechanism, but not those who have lost access to their BTC. 
The main data points we have are the number of wallets created. The reference Bitcoin-QT client has been downloaded 3.3 Million times according to source forge.  Nearly 2 million of those downloads have taken place in the last 12 months. Of course there are additional wallets listed on Bitcoin.org: Multibit, Armory, Electrum, plus Mobile wallets Blockchain, Bitcoin Wallet, Paytunia, Coinbase, and BIPS. Making the general assumptions that combined these wallets represent another 3 Million downloads, but that half of them are owned by people who also have a copy of the Bitcoin-QT client, then that added another 1.5 Million users, bringing the total to 4.8 million users. Increasingly their are services like Bitcoin Transactions on Facebook, Bitcoin Tipper on Twitter, and Coinapult for email / text message that act as wallets and a growing number of offline BTC solutions like paper wallets and offline storage devices. If we add 2 Million people for all of these other solutions combined, then the total comes to 6.8 Million people.
Of course some percentage of users have lost access to their BTC due to hardware failure, theft, lost passwords and so forth. I've heard different estimates, but lets include a discount of 10% of all users into this category. Subtracting these 680,000 users who have lost access, that would bring the final number of 6,120,000 users.
I'd be interested if others have the stats for the other wallets, services and so forth. It would be interesting to build a spread sheet / website in order to estimate the users world wide. We all know the viral nature of Bitcoin and perhaps there is a correlation we can determine between the number of reference client downloads and the number of people that "power" user with the QT client spreads BTC usage to.

Glad to see Students For Liberty accepting BTC. Just made a modest donation.

I'm a little confused by your comment. Mastercoins will float and the market will indeed value them independently.
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:35:36
Oh I agree Mastercoin is the worst ; )
First "they" just let ANYONE generate Mastercoins by sending BTC to the Exodus Address from August 1st to August 31st 
Second "they" start taking those BTC funds and handing them out to developers to code up the Distributed Bitcoin features the BTC community wants.
Third "they" insist everything be OPEN SOURCED. 
Communists I expect are behind it.
: )

I'm not sure why you have an objection to a Mastercoin Foundation Board. Its the same as the Bitcoin Foundation accepting funding and then holding coding competitions and bounties + supporting core devs. If you have a more decentralized way of handing out such funding for development of open source projects I'm all ears. We might well implement it. Ron Gross has proposed Proof of Stake voting in future, which I'm also open to.
