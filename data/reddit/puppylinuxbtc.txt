bitkey.io is an ISO somebody else assembled. The question is, do you trust the person who assembed it? With tutorial you need around 15min to create your own puppy electrum USB, and you probably trust yourself more than unknown person. Therefore, maybe you spend 15min more to create your own usb, but you get additional security.

First step after first boot is creating encrypted savefile. Reboot, and then continue with installation on encrypted savefile. I am not linux expert, but to be safe I would not create anything important before creating encrypted savefile.

I think 1GB stick would be enough, maybe even 512MB. Because you need a room for a savefile too, which you decide the size it will be during creation. The stick I tried had 4GB. It is a really good usage for old stick to become useful. You might try and let us know the smallest that works! :)

Electrum remains after reboot, because we created a savefile.
Strong encryption of savefile is enabled and shown in the video. Plus long password of electrum wallet.
USB is offline (has no internet connection), should be kept physically safe, eg in a safe. You can receive BTC even when this USB is not plugged in. Plug it in only when you need to drain your address (send bitcoins), and that should be rare, at least for addresses you keep there, in a "cold" storage. Make a paper-backup of the seed and password, and keep them in safe, 2 locations. Nothing goes online, no way of hacker to "hack" a paper or unplugged USB. Only physical stealing would do it.
Puppy is smallest I could find that works, 220MB. Ubuntu, Mint etc take around 1.5 GB.
