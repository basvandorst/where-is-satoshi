We have one of those locally.   20% fee to buy and it's usually not working.

LOL...join the club!

Well when the tax folks find out, you may feel differently.

You know, I think he is onto something though.   There should have been a Federal Reserve of tulip bulbs.  Might have saved a lot people from ruin.

As others explained it's a trust fund that supposedly tracks Bitcoin prices, but has been at a premium for months now.  The reason it exists is because for US folks, it's about the only way to get exposure to Bitcoin in a tax deferred retirement account.  When/if one of the Bitcoin ETFs ever get approved, its expected that all the money will flow to them instead.  The company behind GBTC have applied to become an ETF too, but the SEC has not ruled yet.

Me too!  :). Got my wallet on my phone right here!

Well I listened to this kind of crap stuff for a long time.  Then took the time to some actual research, which quickly changed my mind.
  It amazed me how wrong the "financial press" was about crypto in general and BTC in particular.
  Very few of the writers bother to do much original research.  
Most are simply parroting what others have written or are clearly pushing some agenda to divert the casual reader.

If we can just figure out a way to keep the blockchain safe from hackers, it might be worth something.  ;)

I did not run a full node until recently.  I setup a VM on my Linux box, gave it a couple CPU cores, 4GB Ram, and about 170gb disk space.  Loaded Core 0.14.2.  It synced up it s few days and has been perking along find since.

Clear as mud.
Condolences to those who are stuck with unusable BTC-e accounts....hope it gets resolved favorably.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:10:08
You interpretation made more sense to me than the OP
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:22:55
When a "financial expert" can't think of anything original, they revert to talking about tulips.

If I could buy small amounts for only 5-8%, then I could see that as a convenience.
The 20% thing...meh.  Definitely in the same league as payday loanshark in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:14:58
Prior art
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:28:25
Hmmm definitely a bad luck day!
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:24:22
Yes and yes.

Financial markets are buying into bitcoin.  Much more likely to wall street will try to coopt latecomers than the Feds try to crack down on current users.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:32:53
There is one ATM local here.  All others are 100+ miles away.
So the buy fee is high (20%) and its often down.
We need more competion around here!

I am in my late 50s...and was explaining it to my 78 year old friend recently. 
 He is a "conservative" investor who has done well for himself over the years.   He reads Fortune and Forbes and that's about it.  
He said he's read some articles on Bitcoin, but can't understand why anyone would buy into it.  Did I try to convince him to buy some?  No, I didn't.  He knows I am in, and if he wants to bring it up at some point, we can go from there.
At this point in his life, he may be right.  It's just not right for him.  
As I learned years ago, 'not everyone understands Bitcoin',  nor will they...ever.
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:03:53
Yeah it dropped and I didn't buy then.  Dumb me!
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:50:37
Good one. ��
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:26:38
I always advise people to buy low and sell high.  They will ask, " what if it goes down?"   I tell them, "well you shouldn't have bought it,then".  Solid advice from a financial genius.

Go learn what a satoshi is worth.
Hint wikipedia article.
Thats how you divide a Bitcoin.
On the "scaling" thing...its a very complex subject.  As other poster mentioned, Lightning Network is one solution.  There are many others in development.

It all smacks of desperation on the part of the PBOC in my opinion.
Read a book some years back that explained how the state banks of China are really NOT the drivers of the economy there.  
It's money out in the hinterlands that has built up the growth.  And lots of family-tie money coming in from Taiwan.
If that money isnow finding its way into Bitcoin, may be what freaked out the PBOC?
Who knows?

My latest intel said "Everthing is impossible...until someone does it."
Still pondering that one.
