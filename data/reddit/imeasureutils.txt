Airbitz is my go to daily wallet. But there are a lot of more advanced things that I can do on their. 
-printing paper wallets
-backup up to different services
-sending unconfirmed coins
-sending multiple transactions or continuous flow of coins
Etc etc. love the Airbitz guys though.

Actually it doesn't have to adapt that fast.  It can actually take advantage of ethereums risk-taking, and the faster something in ethereum looks profitable, the faster it will be implemented into a bitcoin code revision. Bitcoin wants projects like ethereum desperately. But that doesn't mean it's threatened by it. These competitors only help guide Bitcoin.

So how did it go??
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:14:15
Basically it seems to me that Bitcoin's viability and innovation rests on the ability to coherently identify the owner of a private key and keep that ownership secure from theft. If theft ever becomes prevalent (if property rights are violated), the entire system falls apart and loses it's value.

Can I pay at my local CVS or Walgreens with Bitcoin? Will they accept that as a form of payment?  I always thought money is whatever society accepts as a form of payment. 
If any good can be called money at any time, so long as it's used a medium of exchange, why create a word to differentiate from good?

Really well spoken gentleman, and a good effort at selling Bitcoin, but he's wrong about the emergence of money. 
Money is just a word to describe the "most common medium of exchange". Money is not a ledger, it is a **common denominator**.    
It is the denominator used in ledgers, and allows for the use of economic calculation. 
But in no way can one just arbitrarily decide what the denominator will be in a market, because a random object that meets his "6 factors" doesn't necessarily have a market value in terms of goods being bought and sold. That's the whole reason why money emerges rather than appears from edict or sanction. This is incredibly important to understand.

Could we then safely say that Bitcoin is essentially code that allows property rights allocation and enforcement to private keys within an online cryptographic environment?

I had the new version of Mycelium for iOS on my phone. Other wallets had more security to log in, and the guy selling me coins was in a rush so I busted out a mycelium QR code. Mind you, I did back up the master seed. 
So then when I tried to spend later that day, it request ion my fingerprint but boom nothing.  It wouldn't send. So I wasn't that nervous because since the last time I had a problem, Oleg had responded to me immediately and helped me out and I had met Dmitry personally at the bitcoin center and he even gave me a ride back home. Hell Dmitry's license plate is my iPhone lock screen background for gods sake!
So I was added to a bitcoin telegram group and reached out for help. Then I was added to the mycelium group and told to message their info email. No response. Kept messaging Oleg. No response.  Bruce offered to help and well Bruce and I were neighbors going back to 2009, so eventually I accepted his help. His workaround involved some sort of implementation of mycelium on android and I'm not sure what else to recover my funds which were not in the main account of the HD wallet. Sorry guys I'm not this technically saavy. 
Anyway this buggy software is no good. I should have made my post say iOS Mycelium just say no. Apologies to the team but then again I was surprised that after 7 days they couldn't just offer to secret chat with me on Telegram and figure out the issue.

Plus I'm not sure he knows what insurance means. Sure, you may get your dollar amount back, but someone else is stolen from, so that doesn't exactly qualify as insurance either. The economy loses as a whole because of FDIC.

I DID make a backup, and was still unable to restore my coins. The first time it was rather straight forward since it was some thumbprint id issue. But this second time it was something different altogether

Right, but Mod, all you're admitting is that Bitcoin isn't the savior you thought it would be. If, in order for the network to function properly, a bidding war is required, then a bidding war is required. Financial freedom will come to those who are willing and ABLE to pay for it. But with that increase in capital, solutions for the underclass are bound to happen.
Keeping bitcoin arbitrarily cheap only creates the same problems keeping gasoline arbitrarily cheap during times of crisis (1970s, Hurricane Sandy etc) people pay the expense in time.
TLDR; You can't circumvent the laws of economics. Bitcoin might just be more expensive than people thought.

Look I'm a Bitcoin user, but it's not money. It's very easy to figure out what money is: whatever the general population accepts for payment. That's not Bitcoin right now. It could be in the future, but not now.
