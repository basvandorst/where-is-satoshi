I'd imagine that the value of a bitcoin will be determined by how much effort needs to be expended to obtain bitcoin.  If bitcoin are hard to come by then when you do get some you won't be ready to give them up for some cheap plastic widget.  Manufacturers of goods and providers of services will have to offer better quality goods and services in order for people to give up their bitcoins.

I imagine that the same system that we have now would still be in place.  The difference is where the funding comes from.  A government funded directly by bitcoin would mean that every financial transaction would be transparent.  This will enable citizens to keep an eye on where money is spent.  This may not completely eliminate corruption but I feel it would prevent a lot of it.  And when money is sent to somewhere other than it was meant, there will be a public record of it.  I'm no expert on these matters though.
Edit: just thought of something, the network could demarcate any bitcoin that was taken as tax.  Then let's say a corrupt politician funneled bitcoin to an addrress other than an official address.  The citizens would be able to mark those bitcoin as void and take them back so to speak.
Edit 2: Even better, official bitcoin addresses could be stored on the blockchain, then no public funds will go to any other address?

I was away from the internet over the weekend.  What happened to bitcoin?  Or which trustworthy source could you point me towards?

I didn't downvote but cops aren't forced by the government to protect us.  Why can't taxes be taken out of our bitcoin on the network and divided up to people who are registered on a blockchain as being a police officer, etc?

I think the twist here is that bitcoin is backed by nothing in the same way that Seinfeld is about nothing and yet Seinfeld still has value.

"Dr. Paul believes that vaccines have saved lives, and should be administered to children. His children were all vaccinated. He also believes many vaccines should be voluntary and like most medical decisions, between the doctor and the patient, not the government," he wrote in an email to CNN.
On Tuesday, Paul further clarified his stance, saying he didn't say vaccines caused disorders.
"I did not say vaccines caused disorders, just that they were temporally related -- I did not allege causation. I support vaccines, I receive them myself and I had all of my children vaccinated," Paul said in a statement. "In fact today, I received the booster shot for the vaccines I got when I went to Guatemala last year."

While I'm very glad you donated to Rand, please reconsider your use of isolationist when describing Rand.

I'm unable to keep up with the rate that bitcoin is growing.  I understand that multisig is already a thing, or is that only with some services or what not?

While that is an interesting point you make in the beginning, Paul's definition is money can only be that laid out in the constitution, silver and gold.
I think he really did believe he could be president in the beginning.  I saw signs early on of a defeatist attitude though.  Not that I can remember all of this stuff now, but there ya go.

Yes.  Write your public key address on a piece of paper.  Have a card printed out and guard it like everyone guards their fedres notes.
