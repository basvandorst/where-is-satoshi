The problem with this valuation is that it’s not inherently much more valuable than it was a short period of time ago. One reason for the big housing crash a decade ago was people’s incomes went up 1% and houses went up 40%.

I’ve seen a couple of transaction fees at 10-20%. 10% of 55 is 5.5 btc. Hopefully larger amounts have smaller fees by %

TFW when you pay $100k in transaction fees...

Ok cool. That’s not bad

Exactly. If you had BOA you would probably be paying that fee, because who is going to give xapo more than $1500 or have your paycheck direct deposited?

BOA has on occasion in the past, and was discussing doing again, charging a $5 monthly fee to have an account, so that is in line with real bank fees.

Wouldn't it be traceable at every exchange?

I wouldn't count on being able to use that feature. Netflix is engaged in a cat and mouse game to block every vpn.

Looks like pretty poor correlation to me. Two dudes a couple of hours apart. Or different work schedules

Sounds like fraud.

I wasn’t trying to time the market from a price perspective. I was really confused by the whole s2x thing and wanted it to get resolved before I invested
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:30:20
I’ve been waiting on this for a while. In the meantime the price has gone through the roof. ☹️��

They are getting back the $70m they spent in the $20 referral fees they handed out during their start up.

I read your entire post and I think it's good. The bitcoin developers look like the good guys. Now which coin do they support?
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:17:45
It's a fair question. If they say something is due to a law then they should be able to show you a law. If it is just their policy, they don't need a law.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:24:14
Good grief, all of you guys are acting like this is an absurd request to see a law that the back guy referred to. If it's just their policy then they should just say, "this is our policy" and that is the end of the discussion.
But citing imaginary or non-applicable laws as a justification for something seems extremely unprofessional.
TL;DR: If you are not willing to discuss applicable laws, don't

Uhh the mortgage brokers are friendly and helpful, generally. Underwriters are humorless, unapproacheable, and concerned only with covering their assess.

Or just take a picture of it with your phone app and it's there instantly.
@_date: 2015-11-25 19:15:42
That is a good point, but accomplishing the former (weeding out bad) will largely accomplish the latter (less).
@_date: 2015-11-25 14:00:25
It's crap like this that I point to when people say we need more regulation. Regulation protects only the big banks, NOT the customers. The same guys who got greedy and caused the mortgage bubble.
