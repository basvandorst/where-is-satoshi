I'm very sorry to hear about your loss - it's tragic in many different ways!
I started buying Bitcoins when they were around $5 - by the time I could actually complete those transactions, they were at around $12, then I bought some more at $18. Back then, I felt they had the potential to go to $10,000 some day.
Eventually, I had about 120 BTC, all bought at less than $30 (I never spent more than $2000 buying them). They fell in price and stayed low for a long time after I sold some at around $100 or so - but I had basically sold as much that anything happening would never cause me a loss ... even with Mt.Gox going down, and with them some of my Bitcoins and some of my € that I still had there (and couldn't get the money out because ... well, they were going down).
Eventually, Bitcoin rose again and I sold the remaining 10 or so that I've had at around $500 (I think some at $400, some at $800).
Long story short: I had very little risk, and selling them gave me money when I needed it. I probably made about $6000 of profit, maybe $8000.
Yes, had I held on to those 120 BTC that I once had, with little investment, I would now be a millionaire (at least if I now sold them). That would be very cool and make a lot of things in life a lot easier. BUT: I'm pretty sure I would have been super-stressed out with all the ups and downs and I'm not sure I would/could actually sell them now. The stress might have killed me by now. You never know.
So ... yeah ... keeping at least a few would have probably been a good idea, especially given that I had this $10,000 number in my head even in those early days.
But as much as having money makes life easier, there really are more important things in life.

Doesn't look like it.

Will one millibar be enough to get you drunk, then? ;-)

ROTFL! Kind of sucks that this video is apparently stolen (see top comment) but I still had a very fun time watching it. So cool! So that’s what all those “miners” are doing. ;-)

Thank you for posting the link to the original video - it’s also much better quality.
