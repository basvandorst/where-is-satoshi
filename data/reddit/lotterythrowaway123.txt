I’m literally an eth millionaire guy dude bro. I was there during the ICO. It’s a shit coin. Trust me. Cool tech, great team. Total shit coin. It’s the best shit coin I will grant you that but everything that isn’t BTC is a shitcoin.

I really can't convince you without giving myself away, but crazy enough I'm that ticket.

After tax And lump sum I've been told I'm looking at around $130,000,000 so 40 or 35 or whatever isn't much to me. And I fully believe in the future of Bitcoin and would very much like to enjoy multi billionaire status. Plus I didn't earn this money, it laterally just fell from the sky. So it's House money at this point. Shit I'm set to make $15,000,000 a year off the interest alone. I'm set dude, I still believe in the vision.
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:42:06
Also I like my job haha

I'm not technical enough to do that. How would I do that?

I’ll be retiring at 35 now. That’s how it changed my mind 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:58:22
I agree. Though if I felt I could call the first massive mainstream top I would. I’m just not hubristic enough to believe I can.

When I first got on this sub people were calling him bitcoin Jesus. It was fucking gross. I always knew the guy was sleazy and emotionally unhinged. Glad he’s dead to this community. I hope he sells all his coins.

This is the moment boys... 
Scratch that
This is not a moment, it’s the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin’
But Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’
I’ve been readin’ ‘n writin’
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What’s the state of our nation?
I’m past patiently waitin’. I’m passionately
Smashin’ every expectation
Every action’s an act of creation!
I’m laughin’ in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow

I wish I had read the white paper. Let this be a lesson to all of you. Fuck articles written by journalists. They don’t know shit. Do your due diligence and research things from first principles. My inability to get out of my own way cost me 2 years and I had to pay 10x what this gentleman paid.

I have over 50 bitcoin and I can tell when commenters have less then 0.5. Listen I get it, $3600 is a lot of money, but I’m not gonna get all panicky with you and make rash decisions. I’m gonna sit on my ass and do nothing, I can watch my portfolio go down 200k and not give a shit. You’ll get there too if you can just be patient.

You know some of us would have to give the government hundreds of thousands of dollars in that scenario, thus negating the gains. Plus you can easily be wrong. I’m up 38x from hodling, you doing better then that trading? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:10:23
Dude 2 years ago I felt like shit compared to the guys that had 500 bitcoin. I was like I’ll never be as rich as them and I never will, but I’m still incredibly happy with the amount I hold. 2/3 years from now people will be amazed you have a full coin. Most people wouldn’t put 10k into the bitcoin project today, let alone 125k a few years from now. 
Edit* and remember there’s 40,000,000 millionaires in the world. Not even each current millionaire will be able to own a full coin in the event bitcoin really takes off. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:26:51
Lol I didn’t say you were filthy. Although you need to update your phone lol I just think it’s a weird cultural thing I’ve noticed. Here’s an article you filthy foreigner ;)

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:04
Goddamn I’m bad at math. It’s a miracle I’m a millionaire now lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:33
Probably not, but maybe litecoin 1,000
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:22:38
Lol ok altcoin guy dude bro
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:18:51
Dollars will be worthless at that point 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:55:39
He was wrong and he changed his mind. He disappointed me for quite awhile, but I can forgive the guy. In bitcoin you will be wrong multiple times on major issues, stay humble. I was a big blocker for a solid two months before I actually realized how nonsensical that position was. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:05:39
The people getting in now are definitely the first wave of early adopters. Those of us here for the last few years are the lunatic fringe lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:34:25
You’re still early, but you’re not going to become a multi millionaire anytime soon. Maybe 15 years from now though

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:28:34
The total amount of bitcoins (21 million) are preset within the core code of bitcoin. There will never be more then 21. New bitcoins are created through a process called mining that is used to secure the network.

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:29:20
Get in now. It’s not too late. You’re still way early to the party. Don’t be crying even harder in 3 years time lol

Just don’t slam your pedal to the floor then and you won’t get that performance lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:10:20
1994 is the correct estimation. This will be a bigger bubble then the dot com bubble. We’re 5 years away from the massive pain that will come from a giant contraction.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:30:04
Lol no
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:30:30
Hahahahaha no. Not even close. If this is only 30 million it’s dwarfed by others like mt gox 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:02:38
I’m worth 42 bitcoin, so 1 in 500,000 club. This is a true story that no one ever believes but fuck it, it’s real. I took $200 to the blackjack tables, Christmas of 2014 and I won $5,000. I was drunk and I played super aggressively. I felt like continuing to gamble so a few days later I bought $5,000 worth of BTC at $190ish. That $200 is now worth $200,000. True story. I used to have a bit of a gambling problem to be honest, but I haven’t gambled since that day. 
At the time bitcoin seemed just as risky as sitting down at the blackjack table if not even more risky.
Actually I lied, I still gamble lol just not as much. I’ll blow like $1,000 here and there 
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:10:52
We’re all here to get rich and change the world. It’s always been that way. Satoshis greatest legacy is that he found a way to hack our individual greed for the collective betterment of humanity. Don’t dishonor him by failing to understand that. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:05:51
Hard for me to give you financial advice without knowing your situation, but if you can put the money in and hodl it for 5+ years it’s probably a good idea at any price. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:34:38
No. I’m saying people should get into bitcoin, but be prepared to ride out a downturn. It won’t just go up forever. People with short time horizons aka non hodlers will be slaughtered like sheep. They will buy high because of greed and sell low out of fear. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:51:54
I listened to a similar line of thinking from my father earlier this year about GBTC. Cost me 300k and counting. Don’t listen to your dipshit uncle
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:30:56
I wish you luck. You’ll need it my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:19:06
I actually got 42 for $8600 the year before lol lucky timing I guess.

@_date: 2017-11-01 18:43:46
We’re creating a currency from scratch man. We have to use it as a commodity first. Money is two things. Means of exchange and store of value. Focusing only on means of exchange is short sighted. Store of value comes first.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:19:42
Not to make you feel bad, but I literally invested roughly the same amount at roughly the same time. It’s worked out really fucking well, I just bought a nice house. Lol

@_date: 2017-11-21 12:34:30

Trust me when they say bitcoin they mean the entire crypto space. I agree with you, but there will be a massive bubble and a massive correction. The crazy thing to me is that we’re just at the start of the bubble. It may not pop until 100k.

It’s rare, but when I meet another hodler, somebody who isn’t in it for a quick buck, who understands that scaling isn’t about changing a single variable in the codebase. Who held through the long dark bear market of 14/15, and who legitimately wants to change the world. When I meet that person? I can’t express the gratitude I feel.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:51:45

So your answer is no. You haven’t done as well as me.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:29:49
If you’re a student of financial history you’ll know that a bubble in crypto is inevitable. It’ll be just like the .com bubble was. Many of the icos out there are just like pets.com was. Good ideas with no logistical under pinnings that will never scale. This will be short term bad for bitcoin, long term good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:02:58

I am lol
