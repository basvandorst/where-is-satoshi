Lol, if you think money wars are scary, wait till we see some water wars, desperate men women children picking up anything resembling a weapon to get some water. 
I wish there would never be a war again, but there will be.

If $1000 buys you a house, and you owing a $1000 sells like a lot, now $1000 only buys a car $1000 is a lot less, now $1000 buys you a cup of coffee only $1000 in sent feels like nothing. That's in simple terms how inflation affects debt.

I think he gets it, everything he says is on the money. But this is still a time of early adoption.. are we connecting ourselves to this prematurely... maybe. it might go to 0. That's why we are called early adopters. If this flies and any one hodl'ing is hoping it is will look like a genius. But we could end up bag holding very easily. Faith in product and developers.
