Can someone explain to me what exactly is happening and what it could mean?

Make a shirt that has a QR Code on the back of the shirt that leads to your address! Come up with something clever on the front that would make them want to scan the back! For example, "If you like what you see, check out my behind." I don't know, but I'm sure someone can come up with something better.

Taking your username into account, I can say not all of it. If were to wake up tomorrow and find out that it dropped down to $200 a piece, I can't see myself selling it. Selling them when you are seeing a profit is much harder. Would I hold onto all of the 3.25BTC for another 18-24 months, doubt it. 
Edit - I promise that I will come back to you in 22 months and tell where I am at.

Very similar to yours. I bought 3.25 BTC when they were almost at $1000 a pop. Imagine my face the next couple of days when the prices took a major dip. I panicked, but I didn't sell a single one. I definitely got caught up in all the hype and invested much more than I should have, but it's money that I won't be needing anything soon. 
Since then, I purchased a couple of more at a much cheaper price and have been doing day trading. I made a profit off of those day trades, but I won't be selling my initial 3.25 BTC because with the holidays around the corner, prices are most likely gonna go back up.

I used WU to send money over to a friend in Mexico and the process was more than I thought. 
* First, I need an account and the ID from the receiver. (Name, D.O.B, Address, etc.)
* Second, after I have sent the money I still need to call a number to confirm my transaction.
* Third, depending on what service you choose, it can take a few minutes or days for the transaction to complete and then receiver can pick up the money.
All in all, the whole process probably took almost 15-20 minutes.
Bitcoin can have it all done in less than 2 minutes.

In that case, I'm willing to bet .01 USD/BTC. Deal?

The drawback with Coinbase is that transactions do take several days to go through. However, you can increase your limitations to buying Bitcoins instantly, but that requires giving them your ID and having a Bitcoin over 30 days. I have yet to fulfill this limitation since I'm waiting on the 30 days still. 
Most of what you see over at are people who are having trouble with transactions. More people are willing to post a negative view of something than a positive, especially when people have invested plenty of money. It might take sometime for someone to help you if you are having trouble with a transaction because their main team consist of 8 people. With a large influx of users signing up the past month, you can see why it might take sometime to fix a few issues. 
All in all, I think they are most trustworthy.

Let's take a moment and see how far much we are bouncing back since the bad news of China. As of this post, Bitcoin is worth just shy of $700. It's no $1000 mark like it was back in late November, but just look how much it has bounced back since then. Prices will bounce up and down, but it will still be growing steadily on the long run. 
China is large, but the rest of the world is much bigger. Now, imagine if we hit the $1000 mark again while China is still out of the game. This is would be huge, because if China decided months down the line to do a 180 on their decision of Bitcoin, prices are gonna make a huge jump.

Man, I thought I was being a hotshot when I invested $3k into this, but seeing a number over $30K just blows my mind.

It's all up to you. If you really want to know the people behind coinbase, the co-founder is coming up at 1:30PM at [BloomberTV]( to talk. As someone who has invested money through coinbase, I'm following any bitcoin news as much as I can.

I have bought several Bitcoins off from them and sold one. I haven't had any problems with them.
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:21:31
Great! I'll see you in two years.

I live near Van Nuys. Even if the place is small and unheard of, it's good to see anything where Bitcoin is accepted.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:34:07
I'm curious, when did you sell at $382?

What would be the main reason China to place restrictions on Bitcoin if they were the one's leading the whole thing? If they were to allow Bitcoins as a form of currency, would that not give them power over all this since they are far more into the market than the rest of the world?
