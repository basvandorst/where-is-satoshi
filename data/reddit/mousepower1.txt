@_date: 2017-03-26 05:17:30
I see your point, but creating new outputs, with the intention to use them later is also made cheaper. This would possibly result in more wasteful usage.
As an example of my major concern:
Multisig transaction. 10 different keys signing.
Standard transaction, 1 key signing.
The multisig will use substantially more network resources but benefits from a large discount. The cost per byte is unfair and seems inappropriate from my perspective. 
The cheapest thing should be that which uses the least resources. The more you use, the more you pay. But this shouldn't like a walmart or cosco where you benefit from bulk buying.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:05:56
Yes and no :-)
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:39:26
You make a good argument, but i still don't like the discount  :-)

Why should segwit ever activate?
It is not perfect and something better will likely take its place.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:14:19
Not everyone wants segwit.
Better to separate it out into multiple soft forks so miners can opt-in the changes they want.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:08:45
I am against the signature discount in segwit. They packaged too many changes into a single update and this gives too many people a reason to reject it for one reason or another.
I dont think signaling BU is threatening the network, the network will survive. It is a threat against the core team to show them that they dont own the network.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:59:13
please calm down : - )
Segwit is not a blocksize increase for the non upgraded nodes. These older nodes must be considered. Hence yes and no.
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:25:53
Accept yes, but not relay properly.
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:54:33
Everything can easily be pruned.
The discount unfairly gives advantage to multisig. Nothing anyone has said justifies this.
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:07:41
No lies here. This is my opinion.
Reading an FAQ gives you a one sided view. Read the opposing view aswell, and the truth will be somewhere in the middle.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:55:33
Network traffic and storage requirements treat every byte equally. 
If you are referring to the 1MB limit, just change it to 4MB and thus ensure 100% byte equality.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:03:10
Developers are a small part of the ecosystem, the miners have much more to lose if things go wrong.
I am not an expert on all the aspects of segwit, but i do not agree with the proposed signature discount. The only discount I could get behind would be something which helps to keep the utxo down.
The segwit soft fork will not happen. Better to propose a new soft fork which allows opt in on specific changes only.
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:50:51
I still dont understand why multisig should be subsidised. If people want to create multisig transactions then that is their business, but to receive a discount seems fundamentally wrong?
Block space is block space.
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:50:54
Why don't people want EC? Miners have had the power to mine any size block below 1MB since the cap was put in place. They could mine smaller blocks tomorrow and push the fees up, but they don't...
Perhaps EC of some form is the right way forward?
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:44:53
You are still discounting multisig and using up the precious network resources in an unfair manner. Why should a transaction with uses alot more resources get a discount? Sure in absolute terms it costs more, but this is irrelevant.
Cost should be inline with usage. I.e. you pay per btye in an unbiased manner. The cost should be from censorship or bias.
If you want to consider it from an ethical viewpoint. The multisig should be considered a luxury and 'taxed' for being 'wasteful'. So the signatures would have to pay a premium, not get a discount. If bitcoin is peer to peer cash, then multisig is wasteful?
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:23:20
The simple option would be to have no discount. Everyone pays per btye. Simple is surely better in this case.
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:21:31
But it also opens the door for blockchain bloating via multisig. Do you agree that the multisig transactions should not be discounted? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:21:49
This is not a fair statement.
1) All data needs to be transmitted and propagated through the entire network. These large multisig transactions will help to push low bandwidth nodes off the network.
2) All nodes can run as pruned, so saying that witness data can be pruned later on has no real significance on storage. Some people will always want to store the entire blockchain, others are happy only storing a recent subset.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:28:50
The signature discount in segwit seems inappropriate. I am yet to hear a compelling reason to have this artificial new discount that favours multisig transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:06:49
Your boasting just makes you a target for someone to steal your coins.
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:20:18
This doesnt really justify why there should be a discount at all. From what i can see from your link, blockspace (blockchain storage, data transmission etc) is being wasted to try to encourage people to use segwit transactions?
The cost of transmitting and storing a 4MB block is much greater than a 1MB block, so how can this discount be justified? It just allows multisig transactions to be artifically cheap for their network usage? This is surely a political move where some people want multisig to be cheaper?
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:01:30
The only way is by a software upgrade. Be that hard or soft upgrade.
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:42:27
It does many other things aswell, which not everyone agrees with.
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:31:50
Yep, you are saying segwit is a hard fork masquerading as a soft fork : - )
Hopefully it wont be activated in its current form. Best to remove the discount first to make it unbiased, byte for byte.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:43:17
You don't have to be a segwit expert to realise that there are two opposing camps, both of which are determined to stop the other. This will prevent a 95% activation.
Bitcoin development is at the mercy of who pays the developers salary. I am not complaining, just pointing out that a more modular forking process would help accelerate bitcoin upgrades.
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:39:13
I agree that the newer bitcoin core versions carry improvements, but how that justifies the discount is still beyond me. These benefits sound more like excuses to permit the discount, rather than a real justification for the discount which gives it a fair and unbiased purpose.

Bitcoin has always been 'peer to peer'. Multisig adds significant network cost (data transmission and storage) and is not required for peer to peer.  Multisig is required by business...

A better choice is to campaign for a more sensible option. I am sure there are parts of the segwit upgrade which the miners agree with. 
So abandon segwit, and make the upgrades everyone agrees with, then move on to other more contentious upgrades. Trying to rewrite the rule book after the game has already started is inviting trouble.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:12:57
Witness data is propagated over the whole network, it is then stored on all nodes.
The core team counter this by saying that the witness data is pruned, so takes no storage. But as soon as you prune a node, then you no longer have a full blockchain. If you want pruning then anyone can set their node to be pruned, there is already a mechanism for this.
@_date: 2017-04-05 06:29:21

@_date: 2017-04-08 07:03:42
Proof of work is fine. There is no issue with the asic boost.
If miners keep mining empty blocks, the utility of bitcoin falls, and the price will follow. Hence reduced mining profits.
If the miners can make full blocks with asic boost. Then they get paid and the network has security. Other miners just need to step up their game if they want to compete. There are many ways to skin a cat and i am i sure a slightly different technique could be used which isnt restricted by the patent.
@_date: 2017-04-05 05:44:18
Calling me ignorant doesn't make me so.
LN nodes are a commercial service, as mining is also commercial.

So you just link to bitcoin.org and believe it all without question? The 10 minutes is absolute rubbish. No reference to the hardware used, hence the value is absolutely meaningless.
If some of the old nodes running on very old hardware have a problem keeping up, who cares, kick them off the network. We can't define the network by the slowest computer and network connection in the world.
Take a look at bitcoin.com and you will see a different view. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 03:24:17
Most people here prefer centralisation to a single dev team, controlled by a few people who can commit changes.
This extra implementation is great news. I am sure there will be quite a few bugs at first, but hopefully this spells the end the core devs monopoly. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:33:29
They provide excuses for the discount, not justifications. If you think i am wrong then go ahead and explain why it is ok to discount the multisig so much, and bias these transactions. 
Everytime you say i should read the core blog, it just gives the impression that you don't have any idea about it, and blindly follow core.
@_date: 2017-04-15 07:26:01
Your arrogance is astounding. You seem totally closed to the idea that a hard fork might be the best option at this stage. 
Bu wants bigger blocks, segwit includes bigger blocks, classic wants bigger blocks, xt wants bigger blocks, the miners presumably want bigger blocks... most users want bigger blocks, what is the issue.....?
To me it seems that nearly everyone wants bigger blocks, except some of the core devs and hardliner small blockers. Segwit allows for approximately 4MB blocksize, so let's start there.
If the core team just coded a clean 4MB blocksize increase, with none of the segwit block weight, discount code, then we might have a viable hardfork. Ofcourse there will come a time when this block limit is too small, but it will buy some time and hopefully heal the rift in the community.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:57:59
The segwit signature discount would turn bitcoin into a shitcoin. It gives an unfair and unethical advantage to multisig transactions.

You miss the point entirely. All the core people who signed the HK agreeement, including the blockstream CEO should apologise to the miners.
If you agree to something, then do what you said you would. Stop trying to excuse the devs who caused this mess. There is no reason why the devs and the miners can make agreeements and move forward.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:24:33
Your entire premise is wrong. They are not forging proof of work.
A mathematical problem needs to be solved, and they can solve it. Just because they have a way of doing it better than everyone else, that does not invalidate the solution they found.
Who knows if other miners have different 'secret' techniques which are even better? It is not like they would tell anyone.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:59:48
I agree with most of your points, but just because 10x is more expensive than 1x on absolute terms, it doesnt make it fair or right.
The discount code can surely be improved to prevent incentivising multisig. It would make the discount code more complex, but better a little more complexity than this terrible side effect. Failing that, remove the discount from the segwit update.
Please consider that the core discount may not be the best solution. Too many people seem to have 100% loyalty to their decisions.

@_date: 2017-04-23 18:05:03
So what you are saying is that Jihan planned to signal segwit as per the hk agreement and at later discussions, but didnt follow though. 
So the question is why. There are the asic boost conspiracies being peddled around, but perhaps it relates to the lack of a hard fork implementation for a block size increase.
I am sure neither of us know the exact reason, but maybe it is a bit of both.
Solution.. use your position and influence to solve the impass. Surely this is not a great challenge given your position?
 
I suggest to abandon segwit as it stands. Remake segwit as a hard fork with max blocksize of 4MB, and remove the discount. Ensure that it does not interfer with the covert asicboost. I know you are not in charge of core, but let's not pretend you don't have the influence to make this happen.
Meet with the miners and see if they are happy with this. A compromise on the blocksize may be needed. Eg, automatic 10% increase per year on the max blocksize. This issue can be solved, but when your staff make negative posts about the miners, you are essentially promoting BU to the miners.
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:06:08
You are a really rude person. You seem totally unable to see anything from outside your bubble and are abusive.
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:16:08
Where did you get this idea? The hk agreement killed classic and all the miners moved back to core.
The core devs who attended this meeting know what they did, but don't have the self respect to keep up their end of the bargin.
I am sure some of the core devs who didnt attend this meeting think they have a good compromise with segwit. But those who attended should be ashamed of themselves for causing this mess.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:47:57
Complexity is not a main concern with segwit. The technical debt is an issue, but people are not expecting segwit to fail as it had lots of testing on the bitcoin testnet.
The issue with segwit is that it is coming from the core team and many people believe core is no longer working in bitcoins interest. Hence the disgusting signature discoint.
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:08:07
Segwit should not be activated until the discount code is removed.
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:26:56
I think there is lots of suport for BU / large blocks. They wont voice their support, for the very reason you made in your title.
For most bitcoin companies, lower fees and more transactions are positive for their business? So surely they want more transactions...
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:37:54
The arrogance from you in amazing. 
You are proposing to break the model which has kept bitcoin safe so far.
All it takes is for the miners to resist, and then you have a chain split (hard fork) on your hands. The price will collapse, and who knows what will happen to the hash rate. 
Then everyone jumps ship to alts.
@_date: 2017-04-12 07:57:14
I am 100% against the signature discount. To me it just looks like the corruption of bitcoin and discounts being put in place to benefit lightning and other commercial systems when they come. I believe in equal payment for network use, and this doesn't do that.
You mentioned both the virtual block size and discount in your post. I think you hit the nail on the head with those two items. Without those items segwit would simply be an upgrade and there wouldnt be all this arguing about it being a good or bad scaling solution. The scaling solution could then be performed separately as HF or otherwise.
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:42:14

@_date: 2017-04-01 12:37:35
Why should multisig transactions get a huge discount compared to single sig?
The fee should be on a per byte basis, making all transactions equal. This discount results in a very preferential cost per byte for multisig, vs single sig.
To move coins from A to B, multisig is a luxury / excess, and users should pay fully for their network use.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:23:05
The discount looks like a corporate influence.
If it truely was to help reduce the utxo, then it needs to be better designed.
I agree that Multisig will still pay more fees, but they will pay a slightly larger fee for sending significantly more data over the network. This is not fair.

@_date: 2017-04-05 03:55:45
I was just trying to make the point that the problem with segwit is political.
There is a wide belief that commercial interests have corrupted the core team. MIT and blockstream pay some critical developer wages, and he who pays the piper, calls the tune.
When looking at the signature discount, it looks like the commercial interests putting in some code which will benefit their future lightning network, or other payment solution which requires multisig. This signature discount is then packaged into a large 'important' update to help push it through. 
If the discount were to be added as a separate soft fork, there is little to no chance it would be activated. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:56:02
You are proposing a bitcoin civil war.
The core dev team is free to do as they like, as are the miners. But trying to change the PoW is a pipe dream. It would just result in a new alt coin without sufficient security. 
When a miner invests 10+ million usd in mining equipment, they become a stakeholder. They have alot to lose and will defend their investment at any cost.
Your confrontational approach if entirely wrong. Compromise is needed instead of a civil war, or the value of bitcoin will plunge and the majority of activity will move to ethereum, litecoin, dash, ripple etc.

I don't agree with all of the changes in segwit, and neither do the miners. So why not take the high road and make a smaller less contentious update?
@_date: 2017-04-01 17:45:33
So you have no idea?? I have looked into it and made a post about it recently aswell. There is no proper justification to discount like this, there are only excuses as to why it is not too bad.
I think the reason the discount was added is to provide an unfair benefit to lightning.  It was bundled in with all the other parts of segwit and mostly ignored.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:56:27
He is blocking the core segwit update because he believes it to be the incorrect solution to scaling.  The signature discount needs to be removed. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:16:19
Your boss attended this meeting?
Surely he has the resources to put together a really decent hard fork implementation?
I think all those people who attended to represent core should provide some explaination for their actions and lack of followup from the meeting. We really need these people to be ejected from the bitcoin community for their toxic actions. Difficult in an open project, but something should be done.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:05:52
10 minutes to validate a 2MB transaction on current hardware? Are you referring to a 386 or 486?  Please dont make such ridiculous claims without referencing the computer hardware you are referring to.
Quadratic hashing is a moot point, a straight hard fork with the updates from segwit would solve it. Yes the old nodes get kicked off the network, but who really cares? 
Instead you are proposing adding huge complexity, so that the old nodes are technically on the network, but these old nodes are all but useless. They can't propogate blocks, and the miners will stop accepting transactions from these old nodes because  they can pack in more of the updated transactions into their blocks and make more money. Why does everyone care so much about old nodes? Let's move forward.
Segwit and extension blocks are far too political solutions. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:21:46
Everything you say is based on one big assumption. That the majority of users want segwit. I don't want segwit and i am sure lots of users share my opinion. The segwit poison pill is the signature discount. The sad thing is that most people have no idea about it.
Miners are in charge of ordering transactions. They could quite happily ignore segwit transactions and mine only existing type transactions / empty blocks. Then it is a game of chicken between the wallets/exchanges and the miners. Would the exchanges take the risk of using segwit if they were unsure whether it would be enforce? I don't think they would dare take that risk until segwit was fully activate and stable on the network. So this usaf is a no go.

A poll where companies might be seriously punished for their response are fundamentally flawed. It is like a 'democratic' vote in a dictatorship. If you dont vote for the dictator, then you may be rounded up and put in jail, the same as is you voted for someone else.
As seen with litcoin these past few weeks,  non signally pools were being ddos. Some pools accepted being attacked and chose to continue refusing segwit, but other pools caved in and signaled. Eventually it took a grown up response from the ltc dev team to convince the miners to activate it.
I therefore think these polls are useless to gauge the real opinion of the economic majority. The people who are executing these ddos attacks, and smear campaigns are killing bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:55:13
I didn't say that. 
But there is a difference. The developers invest their time. The miners invest huge amounts of money and their time... who has more to lose?
The developers can easily jump ship to another coin, or get a job at a software company if things go south. Can the same be said for the miners investment?

The same is true for r/btc, but they just take the opposing position.
I stated the fact that the discount gives an unfair advantage to multisig. If you can't understand why this is the case, then that is bad for you. I have yet to see someone from core justify why it is fair to create such a discount for multisig.

Miners are a vital pillar in bitcoin, as are the developers. However it seems most of the users on Reddit overreact to everything.
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:06:04
Please stop trying to avoid the responsibility for this mess. 
Anyone can make a BIP which they have no intention to support.
All the attendees representing core could have easily got together after the meeting to make a solid proposal, implement it and push it. It just seems to me that most of the core attendees were not interested in following through with their agreement, and had no intention to follow through. The devs who had good intentions were left in the cold and made to look dishonest / stupid.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:13:07
The issue is that these developers are very influential in the community and are likely in regular contact with all major devs. This gives credence to them being able to speak for the core dev community. You can dress it up however you like, but this was likely the impression given to the miners.
They flew all the way to HK and convinced the miners to stick with core, in return for x,y and z. Now when they dont deliver on what they signed up to, what do you expect to happen?
Everyone who signed at this meeting is personally accountable for the mess this has caused. Where are the apologies? Where are the steps to make ammends? If you sign up to something, do what you agreed to.

Why should litecoin segwit increase the chance of bitcoin segwit happening? 
If the soft fork happens without incident, then nothing has changed from bitcoin perspective. Segwit is being blocked because of politics, not technical merit.
If the litecoin soft fork causes a chain split, then the chance of segwit on bitcoin falls to zero.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:33:40
The problem is that you seem indoctrinated to believe that everything the core team makes is perfect and in the best interest of bitcoin. Please consider that there are other ways to improve bitcoin.
I agree that engineering tradeoffs always exist, but things like the discount need to be better engineered so that they ONLY achieve their stated goal. Improving the discount will add a little more complexity, but better this than create another problem.

I think their contribution into bitcoin is negative. Their cto and ceo burn large amounts or time on reddit/ twitter and make controversial statements.
This creates a very bad impression from my perspective. Surely they have better things to be doing to advance their company ???

Check my history, i have been complaining about the discount for a while.
I understand the excuses for the discount which you raised, but i dont see the justification for it. From my perspective it looks like an attempt to artifically cheapen multisig transactions to punish people who dont 'upgrade' and to benefit lightning.
A 1x sig transaction is value transfer.
A 10x sig transaction is a bloated excess which takes up significantly more bandwidth and storage, yet for some reason deserves a large discount.
Multisig will be an attack vector to spam the network at a discounted price. Fantastic.
@_date: 2017-04-15 07:36:06
Transactions which cost money are not spam.
You give the example of a miner adding their own high fee transactions. This is costing them money, as it prevents them from including other peoples paid transactions (limited block space). Therefore they are NOT spam. All they are doing making it appear that fees are higher than they truely are.
The whole spam argument is rubbish and used by people who want to push their own agenda. Who are you to judge other peoples transactions. Bitcoin God?
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:17:54
Do you support the segwit signature discount? 
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:26:15
Explain why it is fair for multisig to get a large discount? 
The fee should be byte for btye, but segwit says lets give a huge discount to multisig, and a small discount to standard transactions. This reeks of corporate involvement.
@_date: 2017-04-29 06:32:26
I agree that KYC is also a huge security liability, and with things like bitcoin, we are looking to stay as far away as possible from these 'trusted' 3rd parties. All it takes is one hack, some careless / corrupt employee and everyones kyc data is exposed. 
Now you are also asking users to give up username and password for their bank accounts. If it was a legal requirement then that is one thing, but asking innocent people to give up user and pass is insanity.
Perhaps it would be easier if you just got your users to sign a power of attorney document?
@_date: 2017-04-05 04:10:18
I disagree, i believe the discount is to reduce the cost of multisig to make LN and other commercial services cheaper. The utxo 'fix' you speak about is just an excuse to put the code in.
I could be wrong, but if only utxo was the purpose then i am sure a more complex / better discount proposal would have been proposed.
I would think that network traffic is the biggest resource cost for running a node, not utxo. There are many articles about this, and it is widely used as a key reason for small blocks.
Please note that as soon as you drop 1 single bit from your blockchain, you no longer have a full blockchain. The pruning of witness data and/or blockchain history is entirely disconnected from the discount. They are not a package deal where you have to accept both, this is just what core is trying to push through. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 04:24:26
If the core devs actually took the time to discuss things in a meaningful fashion with the miners, then maybe this political problem wouldn't have happened.
The miners are the biggest investors in bitcoin, and you need to respect their investment.

The five stages of grief.... Bargaining?
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:32:45
When you press send on a transaction, bytes of data are propagated over the bitcoin network to every single node. This data is then stored in the mempool until encorporated into a block.
If i send twice as much data over the network then the fee should be twice as high. All resources matter, and you are conveniently ingoring the network usage, which for so long has been a very public reason for keeping the blocksize small.
I agree that utxo size is a growing issue, but this is not a reason to discount the wasteful multisig.
You can play around with pruning witness data or blocks, but this just means that you dont have a full blockchain. Once you prune anything, your blockchain is incomplete.
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:55:04
Seems we will have to agree to disagree.
There are risks with every option.
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:16:35
Surely having so many of the core devs from Usa, and funded by MIT and Blockstream is worse.
Atleast the miners work in their own interests. They want to make profit and keep bitcoin alive. I am not sure the same is true for the developers.
@_date: 2017-04-23 11:56:54
But what percentage of these companies are afraid of opposing segwit through fear of ddos? Or a smear campaign against them?
@_date: 2017-04-15 06:38:31
You think adding extra complexity is great? 
At some point there will need to be a hard fork, so before making any soft fork changes, there needs to be a plan to simplify these soft fork changes in the future to clean up the code. So when we finally get around to a hard fork, a big code clean up can be performed which simpifies everything. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 12:07:21
The miners have definitely fired core already. Where is the segwit update? Core keeps writing more code and releasing new versions, and it is just being ignored and not used...
This looks like a fired dev tean to me. 
The problem is that they fired the core team without a real replacement team being available.

Yes, because if they dont support the core road map in public then their servers get ddos and a smear campaign is launched against their business.

Luke explained his reasoning for the discount and i accepted his points. But the elephant in the room is the discount given to multisig. There is no explaining this away.
@_date: 2017-04-05 06:18:01
Nice quote :-)
We will have to agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:16:37
So you think it is fair for multisig to get a huge discount, and single sig get a small discount?
Bitcoin must remain neutral, but the signature discount removes neutrality. The transaction cost should be btye for btye, but segwit breaks this link and says we want multisig to be cheaper. Disgusting.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:43:31
If i attend a meeting and mislead the audience. I am responsible, regardless of whether it was intentional or not. Making an apology to the miners for misleading them can go a long way to heal the animosity. Just because you dont value an apology, it doesnt mean it has no value. 
Regardless... if all of the people who signed the agreement got together, they could surely get consensus for a hard fork as agreed. This is what must be so infuriating for the miners. Adam especially has a position of great influence and should stick with his commitments.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:56:18
It is great that there is one honorable dev who is big enough admit some fault.
The talk of nuanced English language with non english speakers is disturbing. From the miners perspective it probably looks like they were grossly mislead, and the core devs just blame it on the language barrier. 
Why is it so difficult for all of those who signed, to make a concerted effort to live up to what they agreed to? 
If they really tried, put together a solid proposal, then it would have succeeded. The miners would have voted on mass for it with their hash power and done deal.

Who is to say that other miners do not have other efficiency advantages. Perhaps someone is mining with a basic quantum computer? I dont know, you dont know, so stop this rubbish.
