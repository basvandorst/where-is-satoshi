Yea I know. People get stuck on that "out of thin air". Don't say anything about "out of thin air" or such. Just tell them that banks create the money and you got message through a little bit better.

If or when crypto is widely used and accepted, people will not use it because they have understood the fraud of fiat and banks, they will use it because it is easy to use and every other are using it too.
People just don't get it. There is really not much correlation about people's education level on this. I have met many PhDs who have no clue. Actually less educated get it a little bit better. The higher educated may begin violently defend the fiat, thinking that they are this way on the winners side, while their arguments reveal that they do not understand at all.
Some people make no sign of reception of the words you are telling. Some other may show signs of fear on their face. They are afraid that their incomprehension is revealed.

Yea. The nodes and channels are like ways to make a payment. So the number of them is more significant. Makes sense. What number of nodes/channels will have significant impact on price?
The number of nodes is increasing about 18% per month and number of channels about 45%.  
[  
Do we know is it more like the old nodes opening more channels or do the new nodes open more channels?

So people like to instead pay fees for exchanges. I think there is demand for atomic swaps. Is it just too difficult to do?

Couple of weeks ago there was a bump up on Lightning Network. Since then, the nodes, channels and capacity have not really increased. Why? Does the most of the effort go to mining now or what?
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:51:10
I think lightning should be made as easy as "download the app and click and play" for both the customers and for the online and offline business.
When only phone is needed to pay and to get payd, it will work. I think a lot attention must put to make it easy to take in use for the companies.

Not in moths. Even Bitcoin is not yet widely accepted.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:30:11
Thanks for reply.
In what time will we see it used in online shopping? To a reasonable extent.
@_date: 2018-10-22 13:15:13
You are right. While fiat is more easy and convenient they will stay on it.
What would make Joesixpack to feel threatened by the government.

Is atomic swap between Bitcoin And Litecoin possible right now? They both have Lightning Networks. That is I guess what is needed for it.
@_date: 2019-03-18 14:04:08
I have been also wondering what is the thing the Ethereum is for.
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:41:53
Did the dump happen because the stock-dump or the china-ponzi-btc-eth-dump or for some other reasons?
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:07:06
Lightning Network growth was a lot faster before. Why it is right now so low?

How do you then know that C have just one UTXO after the transaction?
@_date: 2019-01-30 20:32:59
Why this [
shows less nodes?
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:23:05
Yea I know. But if  they they suck money out of real BTC. Like if people invest paper gold instead of real Gold.
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:08:54
What are the BTC futures proportion for the BTC price decline?
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:52:33
So does that contract owner hold the real BTC private keys which contain some real BTC?

Decades ago, the western countries were functional when people paid taxes to a government that provided free basic infrastructure and services. For companies, people paid for consumer goods.
People had enough money to live. This was called a nation state.
Today, people pay taxes to the government but do not get the infrastructure or services for free, but they also have to buy them from companies, in addition to consumer goods.
People simply run out of money. This is called privatization and globalism.
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:32:58


This. That's the reason.
It is all about TPTB. The Powers That Be. The Banking cartel. Central bank and business banks. Fiat printing. Debt, interest, inflation and inflation which is not compensated in taxation.
The banking cartel prints money and buys the "democratic leaders". Formerly tax funded public infrastructure and services  are privatized to offshore tax havens resulting in reduced tax revenue for state and higher prices for people. People still have to pay tax but they receive less and less public services as in exchange so they have to buy services from private offshore companies.
This is the way how the wealth and property of the nation state and the people is stolen.
That's why "democracies" oppose Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:22:07
So these contract all ready exist? And they are different that the BTC futures? And people are happy to hold these BTC contracts becouse they think they own real BTC?
So I guess the only way to destroy the power of these contracts is real use of BTC in real shopping, since the blockchain accepts only real BTC.

What do you think, how much Bitcoin Cash and SV has been pumped by selling Bitcoin, and how much it has effected on Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:43:43
Could you specify what are paper btc contracts.
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:07:10
I have heard about move from stocks to crypto. But is there some clear evidence of it?
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:47:15
In a country where state property and infrastructure have been privatized for twenty years, as a result of which prices have risen, government and people's debt has multiplied, tax revenue has dropped and people's purchasing power has fallen.
