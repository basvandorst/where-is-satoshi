I've lost everything. I can hardly type. My hands are shaking beyond belief.  13.62.549677 BTC.
Story.  I tried splitting my BTC Private and BTC Diamond with the Electrum Wallet on GitHub without avail.  By inputting my old seeds.  No splitting of the coins. Nothing worked. Noting was working so I enlisted the help of developer Jimmy Song.  I gave him all my old seeds to work on splitting my forks.  
While he was splitting my old seeds I did something REALLY stupid and must have connected my ledger with my BTC into trying to split those coins with BTCPrivate and BTC Diamond into. That didn't seem to work.
Last night I went to bed and had all my BTC on my Ledger.
Woke up this morning and to check my Ledger Balance and ALL of it was gone. I am terrified. I don't know what to do. Please if anyone can help me get my coins back or trace them to the ultimate owner, I would be forever grateful. This is my life savings as I have previously liquidated all of my retirement to place into Bitcoin. Please I'm shaking uncontrollably and need help. Anyone? I'm terrified and about to throw up.
Here's the transaction on the Blockchain as I don't know what to do.

I'm about to break down. I'd give anything to get my coins back. Please...

This is not a scam. I need real expertise 
I just tried to "sign a transaction" with my ledger and I'm not sure if I did it right.

Yeah, I'm thinking the Fake Electrum wallet.  IDK though.
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:47:50
Through encrypted chat and on the phone.

Yes. The electrum wallets interface with the Ledger Nano S.

I spoke to him on the phone. 
And I never gave him my latest seed.
Only my old ones that didn’t have any BTC in them.

Yeah, I thought I was doing everything right.  Please if you're out there, return the BTC and make it right.  Please, don't bankrupt me.
