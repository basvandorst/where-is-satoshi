is right. But if you absolutely MUST have instant buy, you can transfer funds to the fiat wallet on Coinbase. Otherwise you have to wait for the 367.32 years Coinbase takes to transfer coins.

I claim that wallets are a good idea. Because of that, you say I'm an idiot. Logically, that means you think wallets are a bad idea. I don't know if you're purposely trolling people or are actually that bad at logical reasoning, but either way this is getting boring. I'm out. If you think that keeping your coins on an exchange is the best idea, go ahead. In all likelihood you'll be fine, as will all the people who keep them in wallets. There are legitimate uses for both, so anyone claiming that either one is completely useless/stupid is obviously wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:58:28
In all this time you still haven't explained why wallets are stupid. If you can just do that I'll be happy to concede the point.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:26:24
Oh. A stranger on the Internet doesn't agree with me so he thinks I'm a moron. I guess I must really be stupid.
/s, in case that wasn't painfully obvious
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:41:36
WHY! Just once, answer that question.
Why should I keep my coins on an exchange versus in my own wallet. What does an exchange offer that my own wallet does not? Added security? Not if I'm using my own hardware wallet properly. Ease of use? Not at all. My KeepKey is completely foolproof. Privacy? Don't make me laugh
Exchanges are perfectly good for buying and selling bitcoin. That's why they exist. But if you don't need to buy or sell your bitcoin, they have so special function.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:59:02
No need to pay :). It's a simple fix. So long as you have the wallet.dat file, you're good
Go to library/Application support and search for the Bitcoin-QT folder. In there you can find the new wallet.dat file from when you re-downloaded the client. Drag that out and replace it with your old wallet.dat. Once syncing is done everything should be a-okay. Make sure to keep backing up and keeping copies of everything you do until it works, just in case.

I wouldn't support BU, but I'd consider supporting a block size increase if there is significant support for it,
One of my biggest problems with BU is the lack of rigorous peer-review in their code and their generally cavalier and antagonistic attitude. If a bunch of core developers (or other developers) moved towards blocksize increase I might support it.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:08:50
I don't need to trade my Bitcoin. I need to Hodl and use them for purchases. What can an exchange provide me that my hardware wallet cannot? I will say that some of the visceral hatred some people here on r/bitcoin is a tad excessive as exchanges do have their uses (especially for noobs). But to claim that using a personal wallet instead of an exchange is "FUCKING STUPIDITY" is, well, 'fucking stupidity'.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:34:13
They're less common as of late, which makes this drop a little surprising. Still, if you're thinking of putting money in a revolutionary system like Bitcoin you have to be ready to hodl through a few routs here and there.
 I've lost over $1,000 in just the past 24 hours :/

I somehow managed to slip an order in on Coinbase at $1,000.00. 
I'm taking it as a good omen for the future :)
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:15:26
What in the name of the Lord are you talking about? When did I say (1) that I don't need an exchange and (2) that everyone else shouldn't use them? I said exchanges have their uses. I myself have a few hundred dollars sitting on an exchange so that I can buy/sell as need be. I literally said "exchanges do have their uses". But your claim that moving your permanent bitcoin stash off an exchange is a bad idea is just silliness.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:58:57
Me too. I really like using the client but without HD I was kind of pushing it off. Can't wait!

Hey y'all! I've been lurking here for about a year now, but it's high time I joined.

If you can't find the transaction ID, here's what you can do:
First, find your own address. That should be pretty easy to find in your own wallet.
Next, look up your address in a block explorer. You can search for one in Google. I use [blockchain.info](
You can directly click the link of the transaction ID that is above your transaction. That should tell you a little bit about your transaction. Worst case scenario, even if everything goes totally wrong, your coins will drop out of the mempool in a few days. You can wait for them to clear out then try again (maybe with higher fee, though yours seems ok).
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:32:38
If you're willing to wait for at least a year--Hold
If you REALLY want the money--Sell
Bitcoin holding is only for people who are interested in the technology and believe in its long-term potential. If you just want to make a quick buck, Bitcoin probably isn't for you.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:24:26

I'm not a financial advisor, but I think that's a really bad idea.
You should NEVER take a personal loan out to invest, even if you think it's a sure thing. It's the same trap that caught people in the 20's, and in the recent financial crisis, and that gets every desperado hoping to make a quick buck on the racetrack.
My policy in life is (1) never spend more than you can afford to burn and (2) anything purchased with other people's money doesn't belong to you. Sure, I've missed out on some sweet rallies here and there, but it kept me safe in '07 and will always ensure I can live comfortably.

We are indeed. I've been changing up my investment profile a bit during this crash and suddenly found that I'm getting close-ish to the millionthaire's club. I'm pretty young, so I'm in it for the LONG haul.

I can't really imagine a scenario where that's true for a lot of people, but sure, okay. They can go use an exchange then. That's perfectly fine. But you keep going on about how telling people to use a wallet is, and I quote, "FUCKING STUPID", "ignorance", or that they're a "moron". That's not really conducive to a reasonable debate.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:02:57
TL;DR: If you don't want to get involved in this mess, you can either cash out or (better) just ignore it. It'll play out as it will and you'll be fine.
If you're not interested in the technical or political side of this discussion, you have two options.
(1) Cash out now
(2) Go for long term hodling
If we actually do get to a hard fork (which is by no means guaranteed), there will inevitably be some amount of chaos. So if you're in it for the short term gains you may want to cash out. But if you're a hodler and don't want to make a stand on either side, let it all play out for a few days/weeks. You don't need to worry about who will win (I really don't think EITHER will die, let alone both). If there is a hard fork you will have an equal amount of both Bitcoins, so when there's a clear winner you'll be covered.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:44:53
If you have the wallet.dat file, you should be fine.
Go to library/Application Support and look for Bitcoin-QT. Somewhere in there (don't remember exactly where, use spotlight if you can't find it) you should see another wallet.dat file. Drag that one out and replace it your backed-up wallet. Once the whole blockchain downloads everything should be a-ok. Keep making backups in case you mess up.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:35:25
Dear Lord not you again.
Telling people to put their money on a wallet of their own is perfectly good advice. Exchanges are good for buying and selling, personal wallets are good for hodling and using. It's not difficult
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:39:57
In the same time period I lost about 10x that amount but I'm still comfortable spending my Bitcoin. I believe in the system and want to support it as much as I can. I bought in at a low enough price point that only an EXTREME drop (+50%) will make it a bit uncomfortable for me. I don't mind the roller coaster because I'm strapped in for dear life.

I say go for the boring choice! If you've got extra cash that you want out of Bitcoin, put it into more 'stable' investments like stocks/bonds, put it into your 401(K).

Always a pleasure to help newcomers!
If it helps, that's EXACTLY what I did. For the first three months of my crypto adventure I had everything in Coinbase. When I finally got 'Hot-Wallet Anxiety' I invested in a KeepKey and moved everything on there.
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:40:28
Why must every argument involving crypto bring up terrorists, child pornographers, or drugs? Personally, I think that bringing up those issues as if they're end-all arguments make the arguers seem a tad feeble-minded

First off, you're not alone in your confusion. Bitcoin is very confusing for people who are not otherwise involved in computer science. I know this first hand--I'm a biologist! I first started studying Bitcoin when it was at $430 but bought my first bitcoin at $680.
If you are new to the Bitcoin scene and your main intended use is for transferring money, I would recommend just using an online wallet. I'll probably get a decent amount of s**t for suggesting that, and that's actually reasonable. 'Hot' wallets carry many risks. Since you don't personally own your own private keys you're essentially trusting in the probity and professionalism of the people who do have them. That trust hasn't always been deserved (to put it mildly). That being said, these days there are companies like [Coinbase]( and [Gemini]( that have a long history (from a crypto perspective) of quality service, stability, and legitimacy in the eyes of the government. And both offer some level of insurance should something untoward happen.
If you use one of these services I guarantee you won't have any difficulty. Bitcoin was the first investment I ever made in my life, but Coinbase was simple enough that I was able to buy several whole coins without ever feeling anxious or out of my depth. Also, using a hot wallet like the ones provided allows you to access your account from any device connected to the Internet, which would grant you the convenience you desire without needing to invest in bulkier and slightly more complicated hardware solutions.   Coinbase right now serves more countries, but it is not currently active in South Korea. Gemini serves fewer countries, but is active in the US and South Korea.
Whatever you decide, good luck and welcome to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:53:10
Depends on how much BTC you have. Everyone has their own rules, but I think if you own more than 1 Bitcoin a hardware wallet is worth the investment
