Except Kennedy's shoe shine boy was just a scapegoat for his insider trading.

Yep, be good and pay your taxes. After all, only the filthy rich in America can buy their way out of prison time for white collar crime.

Much like the showerthought today mentioned how the internet is now dumber because more idiots use it, crypto is going to take some serious dumbing down of its practical usage in order to catch on.

Step 1: HODL

Step 3: Profit

As this is a noob question, I'll ask it here. Can someone explain the two graphs on  for me? The top graph is price and volume, but the numbers aside from the time at the bottom of it don't make sense to me. The bottom graph is market cap and volume I'm guessing, but I don't understand the bottom and right side numbers.

Why are you here?

Anyone mind explaining $GBTC for me? I see it's an investment trust based upon bitcoin, but how is it directly related? I've read the price of the trust is meant to represent 1/10 of bitcoin’s price, but is that always how it will be? Are there fees associated with it?
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:23:20
The 21 million bitcoin cap is the compelling factor. That's roughly the equivalent of each person in New York City being able to have one bitcoin each, and that's it. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:19:16
Just over, yep.

Wrong sub, so ignore if irrelevant here, but what's the math equivalent with Ethereum?

And if you have over a grand invested, consider getting it off the exchanges and into cold storage.

Ahh yeah, the ol' Windows 95 machine with the built in modem. Man the internet was fun in the second half of the 90's. Ugly gray and really slow, but fun! Thank you NetZero for defending my early free access to the internet! 
*Out of curiosity, I saw NetZero is actually still around. Crazy!*

I know a bamboozle when I hear it, although I hope you're right on the EOY.

I wonder what the default coin offerings will be. Bitcoin of course, maybe Ethereum, Litecoin, others?

I prefer VOO, but same expense ratio on both. That said, I'm keeping plenty of dry powder around despite my crypto hodl. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:29:29
Dry powder in USD is where I say to put it, at least with your new funds. Rock a Capital One savings account for their higher interest rate. I'm not buying anything right now, not equities and not crypto. That said, I'm not selling any crypto either, and haven't sold any stocks that still fit into my long term goals, or at least pay me enough of a dividend to stick around in sticky times. I don't care for any plays on metals though, never have.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:28:17
Agreed, with the price of the market I'd hold USD and wait for a correction, or at least dollar cost average your way in. I'm not sure there's anything I'd be confident in paying the price for today, equities nor cryptos. Hell, I'm even scared of my 10% yielding REITs with the Fed likely rising interest rates today.
