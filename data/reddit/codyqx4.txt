Because Wall Street is going to cry a river of tears about not getting spoon fed free money anymore, and the market will go down, which is mostly propped up on BS now as this recovery is pretty fake for most of us.

Circle always seems to subtract when I buy 0.1 Bitcoin, as in I don't get exactly 0.1 Bitcoin, which sounds like they hid the 20 cents.
This kind of irritates me when it does that and I'd rather just cough up the hidden dime and get exactly what I asked for.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:55:22
Past two times, I've typed in 0.1 BTC and I don't get 0.1 BTC, so the fact that I get less I consider that a fee in Bitcoin instead of USD.
Given that I've gone throught all the BS to get Coinbase verified I just but there. At worst there is a 20 cent difference in the price every time I try.

What you say ignores the fact crap tons of people lost good jobs, hardly anyone gets a good pension anymore, you used to be able to securely work 1 job until you retired, and that many of those "100K Jobs Created" the snakes on TV tell you they made, are low pay crap service jobs.
So yeah if you were old enough to work one of those jobs and didn't get laid off, good, you didn't get a cut. If you are in your 20s then you'll never get those opportunities ever even remotely as easy (my Dad back in the day could just walk into a machine shop, and get a job, just by not being an incompetent idiot. These days lots of stuff requires degrees and certifications).
It ignores that even people with good credit who didn't overbuy on homes, just a few years short of 2008, bought a home at the worst time in the history of the USA.
It ignores the fact many people work harder for that money. "Productivity" reaching record highs was just people made to work basically 2 jobs in 1 for the same pay, to not get laid off outright. There were also record profits 1 year into that recession. Go figure.
The "official" US inflation rate ignores that some goods (food) inflated more than their average.
But yeah OP's image is an exaggeration, because $20 sure as hell didn't get you that much food in 1998, but you can't tell me we didn't get a "cut" in any kind of terms.

Besides the likely possibility you get your own head blown off, how do you know I don't have an account with a piddly $20 bucks, let you have it, and you still get caught and end up in Federal Pump-My-Ass prison while I sit on a stash of much more coin?
Better to go for the paper, if someone has several hundred in their wallet you see all of it. Besides with the passwords I use it would take way too long for anyone to want to wait.

They make insane amounts of profit off our collective money, in risky stuff that crashes the economy and we lose while they get bailouts.
So charging us to give them money that they will make money out of derivatives, pump and dump stocks, FSB, etc and dump bad securities onto us (mortgage-backed stuff they KNEW would fail, but was probably in your 401K), that is the ultimate act of scumbaggery and there isn't a fate too awful for those doing this.

It's all fake to me.
Because they claim unemployment is dropping, Wall Street is happy. 
Doesn't matter that people are running out of unemployment hence not being counted, and most of the new jobs are low paying crap service jobs.
That and valuation of companies like Candy Crush and unprofitable startups valued in the billions.

I know I'm going to get downvoted, but basically with Bitcoin trending down all year, our coin IS losing purchasing power.
I guess things will change in the next halving, because there will be less mining rewards to dole out and be sold, but I avoid taking mine and spending it in hopes of a price increase (because it is either going to have to go up high, or die entirely).
That 40 Paypal boost was gone in two days. If you bought at 440, your coin has lost 11% value.
Not sure what the deal with the price is, but it is either going to rebound over time due to more people using Bitcoin, or keep going down. We do know the dollar is probably never going to reverse, however, because the next 20 Presidents are going to keep mass printing that paper.
To anyone mentioning wages: Yes we get paid more today but inflation has ate that up and then some for a good 40 years. You can't even get a savings account from most banks that will even dream of coming close to matching inflation.
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:16:47
It is really only reversible because of laws and bank policies that make them give you your dollars back.
They could do that Bitcoin if there was a "Bitcoin Bank", or you know, lobby the government so they don't have to give the dollars you got scammed out of. Kinda irrelevant what currency it is.
If Bitcoin got really, really big you can bet most people wouldn't want to "be their own bank". They can't even remember their e-mail password let alone private keys that if lost = bye bye money.
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:07:52
More at the top 1% maybe. More pieces of paper floating around maybe.
We basically have stagnant wages for decades, so most people aren't more wealthy, but it feels like that way when you can be broke and buy a flatscreen.

That is only possible (for enough time for the top to cash out) if more and more people spend every last nickel, AND put themselves in deeper and deeper debt.

See, Coinbase if it fluctuates, just straight up tells me the rate, take it or leave it, up or down, to buy that much.
I do wish Circle had an option like that, because if I want 0.1 BTC, (or an exact amount for a one-off buy), I want that amount and I really don't give a shit that the rate went up 8 cents. The former might just be a little OCD, but if I'm trying to buy something without depleting my current amount, I want that amount right down to the last Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-10-31 14:24:58

I've never calculated it, but I've bought 0.1 at both in quick succession, and I suppose it is feasible that the fraction lost from Circle exceeds the up-front Coinbase fee, but we are also talking small fluctuations in value.
I consider the Circle thing a fee, and I'd rather pay up front than not get the exact BTC I ordered. I mean after all I might be buying that exact quantity down to the last Satoshi to immediately spend, and now I just got deducted, and I know it isn't a BTC miner fee because these companies do everything they can "off-chain".
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:00:37
A lot harder these days to get a Bank Account with false info.
But if they stole someone's ID, then yeah, someone could cheat them.
How much could they really get away with though? There are buy limits aren't there? $50000 lost wouldn't do much them but it sure as hell would wake them up.
They should just temp charge a dollar each time and not have to worry about it. That is what gas stations do.
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:28:34
Yeah, I guess Wall Street doesn't care that all those people who lost good jobs (that are gone forever, hell even China is losing iPhone manufacturing bit by bit due to Foxconn robots) are now working for $8 an hour, but 200K new jobs has to be good right?
I don't know about Bitcoin but I cringe every time I see the DOW at 17K and I know it is a fraud. Damn near every "startup" I hear about is a bubble, I wouldn't invest in a company like the Candy Crush company or any of these tech startups with unsustainable business models and zero profit who are "worth" several billion. They either just sell themselves or someone else comes in to lose money with a better product.

As long as they're too big to fail, they're too big to jail.
If the fines have to be small or tank the economy, put the boot to the throat of the board then. Life sentences in REAL prison, not Club Fed, no parole, no special treatment, and a room with Bubba is going to be much more of a deterrent than fining them 1-10% of their ill gotten gains. Take all their personal assets not tied to the bank. They get no money, no commissary, and nothing to bribe anyone with. We do it to people we accuse of selling drugs that we later declare innocent, after all (the money is guilty by default, the person is not (supposedly), let's take the money anyway).
If someone paid you to piss in the pool, and your only punishment besides people hating you was a $10 fine out of your $1000 paid, many people would go out of their way to piss in the pool as much as possible, and that's effectively our "trickle-down" economy.
