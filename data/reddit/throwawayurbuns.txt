You're absolutely right, if the blockchain cannot be cheaper than wire transfers, then its use for the average person is next to zero.
Unfortunately bitcoin has a problem with fees right now due to the high load on the network and poor scalability. This was an inevitable problem even 5 years ago.
There are solutions such as lightning in the works which I am extremely confident will prove successful.
I was lucky enough to have used bitcoin around 2012 - 2014 and I saw what it was capable of: near instant transfers anywhere in the globe that cost a fraction of a penny.
I have also seen (and used) Lightning Network on the test net and on the main net and I have seen what it is capable of: instant transfers across the globe for fractions of a fraction of a penny.
Fees might be a problem now but I am confident this will be resolved before Jan 2019.

Yet cannot fathom why bitcoin has value...
Perhaps, maybe, just maybe... there is some kind of "common consesus" that gives it value.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:08:05


The purpose of bitcoin is a *decentralized*, *peer to peer*, *open*, *global* and *permissionless* medium of exchange.
It's not just a blockchain that anyone can replicate.


Indeed, lowering fees would be valuable. But the fundamental tenet of decentralization must remain.
Many innovative solutions such as Lightning Network and many others are being developed in the industry.


I use bitcoin to purchase products online, to send money to friends, family and overseas.
It is much easier to transfer with cryptocurrency than it is with a bank transfer.
But I have done my fair share of "pump and dump riding", I discovered bitcoin in 2012 and saw huge potential, from which I greatly profited.


As previously stated, the fundamental tenet of cryptocurrency is that it is decentralized.
That there is no central point of failure.
I'm sure people will attempt centralized cryptocurrencies, but they will become the new PayPal - mired in and held back by reams of financial regulation that hamper adoption, growth, use and innovation.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:18:10


your reasoning?
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:59:02
Bitcoin's value is based on proof of work and that it is a decentralized, trust-less, immutable, global, borderless and open method of transferring value.


Having better technology gives you a slight advantages, but the secret sauce is the above aforementioned.
Bitcoin isn't just a blockchain with 21 million coins. The technology and the source code is only *part* of what make Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
Bitcoins success is in being the only *open* blockchain that has proven immutability, proven robustness to constant attack, openess to innovation, permissionless usage and no restrictions on transfers.
As of yet, no other altcoin has come even *close* to achieving this.
You can have the fastest cheapest transactions in the world, but if the blockchain can be modified, there is a central point of authority/failure, it isnt global, it isn't bordless and it is closed to innovation - it will ultimately fail.

Yeah it seems everyone forgot about that whole reddit controversy about a year back when it came out that a handful of mods controlled the majority of subreddits.

@_date: 2018-01-19 18:47:10
With basic common sense and good security practices, most people should have been able to hold onto their coins from 2013 or earlier.
But then the chances you would have invested in bitcoin in 2013 are slim.
Most people thought it was crazy and that it would never work. Even many who did believe didn't have the confidence to invest, preferring to "wait and see".
It's easy in hindsight to look at $10k a coin and go "damn, wish I got in earlier". 
But would you *really* have invested $500, $1000, perhaps more on an extremely speculative investment? Would you have believed crazy nerds from a subreddit with ~10k readers claiming it would change the world? Would you have believed something worth less than $100 would be worth more than $10k or more?
The vast majority of people didn't.
The scene was very different back then. Buying bitcoin was a hassle and required effort on your part (moreso than today). The most about Bitcoin you'd see in MSM was about Silk Road. The subreddit was tiny. 90% of bitcoin blogs etc. didn't exist. Coin market cap didn't exist. Alt coins were almost non existent.

PayPal was originally envisioned to be basically what Bitcoin is today, a digital currency.
However that vision was watered down, hamstrung and eventually destroyed by regulators and governments.
I suspect a similar fate will befall any other centralized cryptocurrencies.


Blockchain isn't the magic technology that makes Bitcoin tick. Blockchain is only *part* of that.
Sure, a bank *could* implement a blockchain based crypto, but it would be fundamentally pointless.
Blockchain isn't some mystical thing that revolutionizes finance in and of itself. Blockchain is revolutionary in that it solves the double spend problem for **trustless**, **distributed networks**.
With a centralized cryptocurrency it doesn't need a blockchain because it isn't decentralized. You might as well use a database instead and get better performance.
And by having a central authority it simply cannot replicate Bitcoin's "secret sauce".
In the same way that an internet with a central authority would never be able to replicate *the internet*.
The blockchain can be modified by the central authority, ensuring it cannot be truly trusted.
The central authority can be forced to bow to government pressure, and the network can them be molded by regulation.
The central authority can be pressured into not allowing cross border or global transfers.
The central authority can decide to treat transaction however they like, not neutrally like bitcoin.
Restrictions on wallets can be implemented, creating a closed network.
So while a central crypto would be stable (not disputing that), it would fail to garner the trust and innovation that comes from a decentralized and open network.

Bitcoin itself doesn't have any accounts, offices or physical location.
Anyone can download a free wallet client, create their own wallet and be able to send and receive bitcoin anywhere in the world.


Coinbase is not a wallet. it is an exchange where you can buy and sell bitcoin.
**What's the difference between a wallet and exchange?**
A wallet is a standalone program that holds your bitcoins and allows you to make transactions.
You hold the private keys and so you are in direct control of your bitcoin.
Think of it like keeping cash in a safe.
An exchange is a centralized service that lets you buy and sell bitcoin, They usually also offer wallets.
The difference however is that you are giving full control of your bitcoin to the exchange.
Just like a bank, if the exchange get hacked or goes bankrupt, you can lose all of your bitcoin.
I would strongly recommend buying from an exchange, and storing it in your own wallet, not on coinbase.


Unless you have a bitcoin ATM in your area, or can find a local seller on localbitcoins.com to trade with in person, the easiest way to buy bitcoin is online.

Poor wording on my part haha.
I meant you put $100 into the channel as your balance.
You just pay the current bitcoin transaction fee to open a channel, so this can fluctuate up and down.
Let's say the current fee is $5, you pay $5 to open/close the channel.
As more transaction move to LN, fees should become much cheaper. Eventually you'd pay $1 or so to open/close a channel.


You can keep channels open forever and just keep topping them up as you go.
Once exchange start supporting lightning, you could buy BTC from an exchange and have it sent to your LN balance.


I'd really recommend using the lightning test network to see how it all works.
You can download the [eclair wallet on android]( get some free test bitcoins [from a faucet]( and [start making test payments](
It's super easy and you'll see how fast and cheap it is!

The network was nowhere near capacity and so even the cheapest fees could easily get in the next block.
We've seen a huge increase in capacity since, causing high fees. But LN looks like to most promising long term solution, and having used it I can assure you it does just that: lower fees.


It's possible but it depends on many factors.
Since it's centralized it would have little need for miners. But the entity which operates the currency would have overheads, which would be factored into fees.
The overheads for storing and securing potentially billions of dollars worth of gold wouldn't be cheap, and that's without factoring in the cost of running and maintaining the centralized network.
Considering the fees charge by PayPal and Western Union for similar services it's likely the fees wouldn't be much lower.


Blockchain has many uses for the traditional banking sector and could make current processes a lot more efficient, so I expect almost all bank will come to use them.
But fundamentally a bank or central bank owned and controlled coin cannot be trusted to the same extent as Bitcoin.
The network is at the mercy of the central authority. Supply can be increased/decreased, fees can be changed, transactions can be blocked, even outright fraud could be faciliated by issuing more coins without the gold to back them up.

The 51% has always been a theoretical attack.
In practice it would be prohibitively expensive to perform and at most, you'd be able to block some transactions from being included in blocks.
Rewriting the block-chain will still be impossible. You couldn't make more coins etc.
Of course getting 51% is one thing, maintaining 51% is much, much, much harder.

You don't open up a channel for each transaction.
You'd probably open one big channel for $100 and then you can make as many payments as you like.
$5 for your coffee, $20 on Amazon, $30 at a restaurant etc...
Once you have a channel open, you can send payment to anyone else on the network.
Once you run out of funds, you top them back up again through lightning network from somewhere like and exchange - or just open a new channel (upto you).
You only need to close the channel when you want to finalize the balance.

Satoshi was posting to Bitcointalk when Steve Jobs was dead. So I'd wager no.
No-one knows who Satoshi is, but either way it was very important to him/her/them that no-one found out their real identity.
I think the fact that Satoshi disappeared after Gavin Andresen introduced Bitcoin to the CIA holds some weight though. And there was also the whole wikileaks things too.


If Satoshi ever converted his BTC to fiat, it would tie his identity to the wallet and expose his true identity. That's assuming he still has the private key.
I doubt they will ever be spent.
To be honest, I think the most interesting questions isn't who is Satoshi, but *why* would Satoshi hide his identity in the first place?

If the wallet you originally sent the BTC from has a fair amount of BTC, this is normal.
It would have used the coins from the original wallet as inputs, sent the value you want to send to the breadwallet, and the "change" from the coins is returned to your original wallet.
Imagine it like this: You have a wallet with 2 $10 bills and 1 $20 bill - making a total wallet balance of $40. You want to send $15 to Alice.
Since we don't have a $5 bill in our wallet, the transaction then takes two $10 bills as an input, gives Alice $15, and then returns the $5 change to your original wallet as an output.

Basically it's a Javascript based bitcoin miner that webmasters embed in their site's source code to generate a little extra profit.
The idea is you use the CPU resources of each person visiting your site to mine bitcoin.
Once you get 100,000's of users that computing power quickly adds up.
It's been given a bad name in the technology/security industry by unscrupulous webmasters attempting to use 80 - 100% of user's CPU power (without the end user's consent).
Avast picks it up as a virus/malware to protect average users from that sort of stuff.

I remember back in 2012/2013, Silk Road accounted for upwards of 50% of all BTC transactions. Even back then it was a multi billion dollar market.
It might not make up the bulk anymore, but the industry has continued to grow and is worth a *lot* more than it was back then.

But when?
We've had Segwit since August, yet hardly anyone is using it, big exchanges still aren't supporting it.
Lightning will be great *long term*, but we're still looking at 3 - 6 months+ *after release* before exchanges start implementing it.
All the while fees are increasing by about 100 sat/byte per day.
Unfortunately it looks like fees will continue to climb for the foreseeable future :(

It's funny how in the space of a few years it's gone from something nobody could care less about, to "the next big thing".
Even though I was told "sell" for years and years by my family, I don't think it's a bad thing.
Family are only looking out for your best interests - from their perspective, encouraging you to put money into a fledgling technology (they don't understand) that could (in their eyes) crumble at any moment would be reckless on their part.
Of course with hindsight their advice was incorrect, but ultimately they just didn't want to see me lose my money - and I respect that.
I'd be more concerned if my family told me to go all in back in 2012.


100% agree, trust your gut. Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right - but I know to trust my gut instinct.
That being said, it's good to listen to differing opinions from people who you *trust and respect*.

There's a lot of hype at the moment, coupled with this BCH panic.
We've just had the huge bull run to $19k, mainstream media coverage and now the BCH panic.
The market is going wild right now. Lots of people are transferring coins, pushing up tx fees.
Give it a week or two, once things have settled tx fees will begin to come back down.
If you look at the [mempool]( over the year, you'll see we regularly have periods where fees go up, then once the market calms down they begin to drop.
In June, fees were higher than they are now. Yet by July/August they were back to normal.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:35:21
Generally whenever a pool has neared 51% there has been a *huge* backlash from the community against that pool, and their % has dropped significantly as a result.
Illict deals are possible. If a 51% attacks were to happen, I'd bet my money on it happening through agreements with other miners.
In reality though - even with a 51% attack, there's not an *awful* lot the attacker could do. You still couldn't steal other people's bitcoins, you still couldn't increase the max coin limit etc.
The most you could realistically achieve would be to block some transactions from being added to the blockchain and you *might* be able to double spend your own coins.
Remember that anyone running a full node would still be "looking out" for illegitimate blocks and would still reject them as per usual. Miners are only one part of the network.
So in conclusion - a 51% attack is certainly possible. Unlikely, but possible. In reality, the hassle and expense would far outweigh any gains you would receive from performing a 51% attack.

No. This is *far* from the case. BTC is still very much being actively developed.


Things take time. When releasing software (especially when money is on the line) you want to be confident there are no bugs that could compromise the system.
This requires lots of time, testing and debugging.


Who knows. But personally, I'm still backing BTC.
I'd rather LN take its time and be *stable* at release, than come up with a quick fix that could cause more problems down the line.

If a substantial sum goes into your account, and it hasn't come from your job/sale of house (or anything they're aware of) they'll come knocking and demanding answers.

Assume you're an average joe, you hear about this "bitcoin" thing and how it's rapidly going up in price.
You wanna get in on some of that action.
Screw reading up on all this blockchain stuff, transaction fees, miners, hashes, private keys. And what the *hell* is a Segwit?? Sounds like some mumbo jumbo jargon to me.
All I know is its going up in price and thats good enough for me.
You chuck in a few thousand $, probably way more than you should, but hey who cares it's only going up in value right?
Next day you wake up, Bitcoin is dropping in price and the money you invested is dropping by the second.
"OH SH--, THE BUBBLE IS BURSTING. MARKET IS CRASHING. FOX NEWS WAS RIGHT"
Panicked, you immediately sell to prevent any further losses.
And that is panic selling in a nutshell.


I wouldn't get ahead of yourself. Last time I checked (1 minute ago) the US dollar was doing pretty fine.
The US &amp; dollar are not on the brink of financial collapse. US dollar is still the world reserve currency.

By the same logic, the "true" value of the US Dollar is what it costs to produce - which for a $1 bill is about 4 cents.

Miners fees and transaction times are currently the two big things that are stopping bitcoin being used by the mainstream.

What he's saying is it should *just work*.
The average user doesn't want to learn about segwit, they don't want to switch wallets, they don't want to keep upto date on crypto news - they just want to send/recieve their bitcoins.
The user should have to do **nothing** for it to work as intended. Updates should be *automatic*.
The user just sends/receives their bitcoins and that's all they need to know.
If I use Apple pay, it just works. If I use Paypal, it just works. My banking app, just works. No learning this, switching accounts etc.
The fact we are expecting users to learn about segwit, switch their wallets over and *then* keep upto date on any futures changes to the network, is the reason segwit adoption is so low.
It's the complete opposite of user friendly.

I don't think anybody disagrees that lightning will help ease the problem *long term*. But we've still got to wait for release, and then a further 3 - 6 months+ before exchanges bother to implement it.
And that whole time fees are only going to keep rising.
Those who are hoping lightning will be released and fees will instantly go down are deluding themselves.


The Bcash solution is doomed to failure, you're quite right - we *can't* just keep increasing block sizes forever it isn't sustainable and would cause more problems than it would solve.
But arguing against raising the block limit **at all** is equally ridiculous.


In the space of a few years Bitcoin has gone from a *functional* and *useful* currency to a "store of value" with ridiculous fees.
Bitcoin is actively *losing* functionality and people just seem to shrug this off as "meh who cares".
It's just a convenient scapegoat to why we should ignore the fees issue.
Even as a "store of value" its becoming useless. What point is a store of value if you pay insane fees just to move money in and out? It's not sustainable.
And pointing that out doesn't make you a Bcash shill.

Yes, but you need to know the right people, and you'll need to have decent holdings for it to be worth their time (Read: $1M+).
You could do it yourself, but bear in mind that at *some* point you're going to want to transfer the money from your offshore account to your bank account, and that's where they'll catch you out.
You'll need some way of funneling that cash through multiple shell companies (hello corporate tax!), and then out of those companies into your bank.
You'll also then need some sort of intermediary bank account/shell company to conceal the fact that the cash is coming from your offshore account in the first place.
Then on top of that you'll want to find a way of getting around the corporation tax on your company profits.
And you need to do all of that in a way that not only won't arouse the suspicion of the tax authorities, but also looks legit if you do get investigated in 1/5/10/20 years time. Remember, tax avoidance is a serious crime in most jurisdictions.
As you can see, this stuff gets very complicated very quickly.

Yeah, it *was* possible to mine bitcoin on a PC/laptop, but that was 6-7 *years* ago.
Now you need to use an ASIC miner, and have access to cheap electricity.
Word of warning though, it is a *very* competitive industry. You will be competing against people who have spent tens of millions of dollars building data centres filled with tens of thousands of ASIC miners.
If you want to do it for fun, go ahead. But would I recommend anyone to seriously get involved in mining in 2017? Unless you've got a lot of capital to invest and can relocate to somewhere like China with very cheap electricity - No.

There's certainly an element of that, but fees are without a doubt the biggest factor. No customer in their right mind wants to pay $10+ fees on their purchase.


In some way yes. But let's not forget that darknet markets are multi billion dollar markets that make up a substantial chuck of BTC transactions.

At this point you can't ban cryptocurrency. The genie is already well and truly out of the bottle. You could try, but would ultimately fail.
It's like the "government will ban encryption they can't break" you hear every few months. They have the motive to do so. They *could* do so. But the ease with which other forms of encryption would pop-up means it would be doomed to failure right from the start.
Even then, how would such a thing be enforced? You can't stop people from installing and running a crypto client or a wallet. Like you can't stop 2 people who own cryptocurrency from trading.
The weakest link would be exchanges or transfers to domestic bank accounts, but that could be easily routed around as well.

I wouldn't say never, just not for the short term future.
If nodes + miners don't want it, it's not happening. As it stands right now, they don't want bigger blocks.
Right now we already have a blocksize increase, Segwit, which effectively doubled blocksize. But no-one is currently using it.
Most of the network is in agreement that if we raise the blocksize now, no-one will bother to implement segwit. We'll then be back in this exact same situation in a few months when blocks start getting full again.
Why go through all of the hassle of a hard fork, when people aren't even bothering to use the increased blocksize they've got right in front of them?
This entire problem could be solved *overnight* if everyone just switched to Segwit. That's why its so frustrating.
Once everyone switches to Segwit, that's when the network will consider bigger blocks. But if everyone switched to Segwit, we wouldn't need bigger blocks.

I'm not that familiar with lightning network so I may be totally wrong here, but from what I've read it doesn't seem to solve the initial problem.
If you still have to "pre-fund" the channel, then you're going to have to pay a big fee on that first deposit, which is undesirable. 
It's like if you needed to buy gift cards before you can buy coffee at Starbucks, but there's a $20 fee for buying the gift card originally.
If you're topping up with $100 or less, you've lost a substantial chunk of your money just by opening the channel.
For people who buy a coffee once every few months, they're not going to want to prefund the channel. They just want to pay for the coffee when they buy it. So for them to open a channel would not only be a waste of time, but would lose them money.
Why would anyone bother? If I could just pay with my Debit Card instead and pay no fee at all?
It seems that lightning offers great, fast transactions once the channel is opened - but you've still gotta pay bitcoin's high fees to open the channel in the first place. Somewhat defeats the purpose?
As I said, I may just be talking rubbish here.
Would it be possible to do a one-time big transfer to one channel, and use that everywhere like a bank account?

The number of blocks always stays the same. Only 1 block can be mined approx every 10 minutes. Regardless of how many transactions are waiting to get into the next block.


A miner gets 25 BTC as a block reward, plus any miners fees for the block.
Miners earn more money per block if the transaction fees are higher.
So yes, miners do have a financial motive to artificially inflate transaction fees.
But as others have stated, there is little evidence of this happening and for them to spam the network would likely cost them more than they would earn from it.

Increasing blocksize only scales if you are happy for the network to become more centralized and therefore, less secure.
By increasing the block size, you increase the size of the blockchain.
The bigger the blockchain is, the less people can store it. The less people that can store it, the more centralized it becomes. The more centralized it becomes, the less secure the network is.

So what do you do? You *scale* with demand.
It's like saying to PayPal back in the early 2000's that it would never take off because their servers couldn't handle millions of concurrent connections.

And even today, if the whole world tried to use PayPal, it would crash and burn. It's a strawman argument.

Increasing blocksize isn't the "quick fix" that everyone makes it out to be.
4mb blocks still require a hard fork with no guarantee that anyone would adopt it.
So even if we released a 4mb hardfork, and assuming everyone did switch, it would still be 6 months+ before the network migrated over.
BCH will run into the exact same issue when they try to increase their blocksize
And do we *really* want to split the community again with a hardfork right after the shitstorm with the BCH fork?
Thats without taking into account centralization and all the other problems that come along with increasing blocksize.

I'm just pointing out an inherent flaw of Segwit - that it assumes the end user has more knowledge of bitcoin than they probably do.
I'm a developer by trade and I've looked into writing a program that would automatically migrate non segwit addresses to segwit addresses.
Problem is, there doesn't seem to be a way to migrate to a segwit wallet without transferring your funds via the blockchain to that new segwit wallet.
Of course that means taking a user's private key and transferring the funds for them, which is way too risky for me to touch.
It has to be done manually and so we're kinda just crossing our fingers and hoping that people who aren't knowledgeable about the underlying protocol will migrate of their own accord.

It's an interesting thought.
Personally, I think Satoshi purposely left the bitcoin project so that there was no central figurehead.
I think he/she knew that having a central figure would be detrimental, that they would have a lot of power over the community that could potentially be abused.
I highly doubt that anyone in that position (Satoshi, Vitalik, Charlie Lee etc.) would intentionally sabotage their own project, there's very little to be gained from that.
They could be the target of a state-sponsored smear campaign, designed to erode public trust in Litecoin/Ethereum.
Or similarly subject to pressure, blackmail, or being threatened.
It may sound a bit crazy, but that's precisely what governments do regularly. I would not expect cryptocurrency to be immune from such a state sponsored attack.
But its not just "attacks" in the traditional sense of destroying the network. But also attacks which undermine the core concepts of immutability, decentralisation etc.
