**Wells Fargo calls Bitcoin summit on ‘rules of engagement’**
*By Stephen Foley and Camilla Hall in New York*
Wells Fargo has convened a group of finance executives, virtual currency experts and representatives from the US government to discuss “rules of engagement” with Bitcoin, amid concern about the money laundering risks of the new currency.
The bank, the largest in the US by market value, has emerged as one major financial institution interested in dealing with a potential new Bitcoin economy. But regulatory uncertainty has deterred banks from offering services to virtual currency start-ups.
Wells’ anti-money laundering chief, Jim Richards, has launched a group to examine how it might safely offer Bitcoin-related services or banking arrangements to virtual currency entrepreneurs, according to people familiar with the initiative.
Wells chief executive John Stumpf said it was the bank’s practice to examine financial innovations.
“We have made enormous investments as a company and as an industry in a payments system that is secure, and we need to be sure we are up to speed with what other things are going on and their risks and rewards,” he said.
“We want to make sure we understand what it is, what it does and what it does not . . . . The world is changing and will continue to change. Whether Bitcoin will be a big part of that, who knows?”
The difficulty in persuading financial institutions to offer bank accounts has become one of the biggest difficulties facing Bitcoin entrepreneurs in the US.
Wells’ public-private group, comprising more than a dozen members, was scheduled to meet in San Francisco on Tuesday to debate the security issues surrounding banking and Bitcoin.
One possible aim would be to produce a set of anti-money laundering principles for established financial institutions to follow when dealing with virtual currency start-ups, according to a person familiar with the event.
Last year, US authorities seized a Wells Fargo bank account belonging to Mark Karpeles, founder of Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox, and alleged that he failed to declare he was operating a money transmitting business when he opened the account in May 2011.
Earlier in 2013, the US Treasury declared that Bitcoin businesses must register as money services businesses and impose anti-money laundering checks on customers, just like traditional banks. Most of the 50 US states also impose their own regulations on money services businesses.
Banks worried that they would be held responsible for any money laundering breaches at Bitcoin companies that failed to meet these stringent standards and before each of the states had clarified their own approaches to Bitcoin.
Last month the Congressional Research Service circulated a report on virtual currencies for policy makers, setting out a list of areas where the legal and regulatory approach to Bitcoin remains unclear. These range from national tax issues, because Bitcoin profits are not recorded within the traditional financial system, to concerns among individual states.
“Bitcoin raises a number of legal and regulatory concerns including its potential for facilitating money laundering, its treatment under federal securities law, and its status in the regulation of foreign exchange trading,” the report said.
And it added: “State authorities moving in the direction of regulating virtual currencies are sometimes discovering problems in applying existing laws to the technological currencies.”

It can be faster if we start supporting off-chain transactions with periodic on-chain settlement between transaction providers. This would basically scale infinitely, be instant, and offers a different set of anonymity trade-offs. Basically you need to trust the transaction providers, but nobody else (except for whoever they share info with) can tell your transaction patterns.
You could still use on-chain transactions in the cases you need it (donating to controversial organizations etc), but for making uncontroversial payments (think: cup of coffee), on-chain transactions would be great.

They mined it just seconds after the previous block, which they also mined, so there were no new transactions which satisfied their very strict conditions for inclusion.

But they will still own all that mining power. At any moment, they could start using it for evil. Bitcoin is not trust-free any longer; we live on our knees now, constantly under threat from these people.

TOKYO—The top executive of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said the company "deeply apologizes for any delay in our responses" but declined to shed light on how customer funds are protected.
Mark Karpeles, CEO of Tokyo-based Tibanne, the operator of Mt. Gox, in an email interview declined to comment on increasing concerns among customers about the financial status of the exchange, which has frozen customer withdrawals for more than a week, saying it is limiting itself to answer only technical-related questions.
"We understand your concern on this issue, said Mr. Karpeles in the email on Monday. "However, any customer-related questions are confidential."
Later Monday, Mt. Gox issued a statement on its website saying it had implemented a solution and "should be able to resume withdrawals soon."
It said it would start withdrawals at a moderated pace and impose new daily and monthly limits to prevent problems.
Customers of the company, including at least three who have protested outside Mt. Gox's Tokyo offices, have been pressing the trading platform to disclose more about its financial health.
In the email interview with The Wall Street Journal, the French executive repeatedly responded to questions about the company's solvency by saying that the matter is confidential. He did say, though, that the company had discussed its business model with Japanese authorities "to ensure that we are operating within the law here."
Mt. Gox has been wrestling with technical problems since July, when it first halted withdrawals in dollars. After Mt. Gox again abruptly halted customer withdrawals Feb. 7, it blamed its issues on a glitch in the bitcoin software.
On Feb. 10, Mt. Gox said it had been hit by fraudulent requests for payment by users exploiting a feature in the core protocol known as "transaction malleability."
Initially, many in the bitcoin community argued that Mt. Gox had simply failed to use the correct internal procedures to protect its accounts. The next day, however, a hacking attack crippled other bitcoin-exchange platforms and raised questions about the security of the global network for trading the virtual currency.
Asked why the company hadn't addressed customers' concerns sooner, Mr. Karpeles responded, "I assume you refer to the malleability issue. We sincerely apologize for this incident; however, please understand that we are NOT the developers of Bitcoin."
He said that, as a trading platform, "We are trying our best to work out the problems and make it better for our customers."
He added, "We are facing an issue that was known, yet, overlooked by the developers of bitcoin since 2011. We are very surprised that anyone could fault Mt. Gox instead of the bitcoin software."

I don't think MD5 was ever thought of as unbreakable. At least these days, cryptographers seem to acknowledge that they know very little about the long-term viability of any existing hash algorithm, and it probably wasn't much different when MD5 was cutting edge. They *hoped* it would withstand attack, the same as they still hope the same for SHA-2 and even SHA-3. The only thing that seems to strengthen people's faith in a hashing algorithm is how much time passes without attacks getting published, and in that sense, SHA-2 is still great after 13 years, much longer than MD5.

Off-chain transactions don't mean you can never do on-chain transactions, in the cases where you think that's desirable. I don't care if one central party knows that I bought a cup of coffee, and all my cups of coffee don't need to be on the blockchain.
On the blockchain, *everyone* can track your transactions. Off the blockchain, the amount of people that can track them are limited to the payment processor and perhaps the settlement network they're part of. And perhaps some government agency if they demand to. So I'll fund Wikileaks on-blockchain with nice mixing, and I'll buy my cups of coffee off-blockchain.

A fix to the software code behind bitcoin won't be ready until next week, according to the lead programmer charged with solving the problem, highlighting the vulnerabilities of the computer-driven virtual currency.
Hackers on Monday began attacking the world's largest bitcoin exchanges to exploit a flaw in the code that could allow users to send false requests to resend payments. The attacks forced the exchanges to suspend customer withdrawals.
The Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange on Monday said it had received fraudulent requests. Bitcoin's core developers later that day discovered a bug within a part of its digital infrastructure. The next morning, hackers exploited the bug and swarmed other exchanges.
The delay in solving the code problem could undermine confidence in the five-year-old virtual currency, which has seen a dramatic run-up in prices in the past year and has begun to gain adoption by a broad swath of merchants.
"It will take two or three days to write the code and longer than that to test it and convince ourselves that we didn't break something else," said Gavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, a trade organization representing bitcoin-related businesses. Mr. Andresen is head of the five-member team of programmers attempting to fix the problem.
Another member of the team, Jeff Garzik of Atlanta-based payment processor BitPay, has devised workaround solutions for exchanges to clean up and reconcile their bitcoin accounts and restore operations.
In a mark of that effort's slow but deliberate progress, Slovenia-based Bitstamp, the world's biggest bitcoin-to-dollars exchange, announced early Friday it expected to resume processing withdrawals later in the day.
Mt. Gox, for its part, soon will introduce a new identification system for tracking bitcoin withdrawals, a move intended to protect against attack and restore operations, according to a post in a bitcoin developers' chat room by a user identified as Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO. The company couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
It' wasn't clear whether the changes had been implemented at either exchange. Late Friday afternoon, no updates had been made to their websites' respective news streams.
Bitcoin's price rose 8.63% to $650.61 on Friday, according to an index produced by Coindesk comprising prices from Bitstamp and the Cyprus-based BTC-e exchange.
With bitcoin's market capitalization standing at more than $8 billion and thousands of enterprises and digital wallets now hooked into the bitcoin economy, pressure has been strong on the small development team that looks after bitcoin's open-source software.
"One of the real challenges is getting work done when there is a lot of noise," said Mr. Andresen, who described a barrage of requests that flooded in Tuesday, after news of the attack emerged, from anxious merchant payment processors, brokers and digital wallet providers. "There is a real danger of trying to do too many things at once or doing things sloppily. And that is probably the biggest challenge: to try to balance being focused but also listen to what everyone is saying, making suggestions, making complaints, accusations."
On Monday morning, Mt. Gox said individuals had been exploiting a problematic feature of bitcoin's underlying software to trick the exchange into resending bitcoin when payments had already been made. That day, Mr. Andresen put a post on the Bitcoin Foundation's blog declaring that "contrary to Mt. Gox's statement, Bitcoin is not at fault."
But that afternoon, one of the five developers belatedly identified a bug in the code. The next morning a hacker exploited it and sent a barrage of mutated transactions that crippled Bitstamp and BTC-e. According to Mr. Garzik, the hacker took every transaction occurring on the entire bitcoin network and duplicated it under new identification codes, thus overwhelming and confusing the exchanges' computer systems.

The Bitcoin Foundation funds Bitcoin's development, at least through paying Gavin's salary. Mt. Gox is a gold member, which costs $25,000 annually, paid in bitcoin. It's not completely fair to say that they don't fund Bitcoin development.

* USD withdrawals have been effectively unavailable for a long time, nothing new, but:
* This has now started affecting EUR as well, and:
* For a few days now [even bitcoins can't be withdrawn]( purportedly because of some bug, but that is very suspicious. The amount of bitcoins affected by this is now over 9000 and people are freaking out.
* Account verification literally takes months at this point, and it's tempting to think they've simply stopped verifying accounts to try to stem capital flight. People with unverified accounts send bitcoins to them, unaware that they need to verify in order to ever withdraw them. Those bitcoins now seem out of their control indefinitely, if not downright lost.
* Asks are down to less than 15K BTC, where it used to be well above 20K a few weeks ago. People have been buying them up because bitcoins were the only way they could withdraw, but now even that avenue is closed.
* Meanwhile, support issues go unanswered, and [their twitter account is full of copypasta](

I'm glad to hear I've been wrong - you have come off as the archetypical paranoid anti-Foundation activist to me. It's been hard for me to understand your point.
Ultimately you seem to think that whatever the $25,000 fee contributes to Bitcoin's development does not offset the damage they've done to Bitcoin's reputation. Seeing as Bitcoin's market cap are billions lower by now, this is of course true. I never said anything about the net effect.
I responded to a claim that Mt. Gox rakes in money and just sits on them. They *do* pay $25,000 each year to the Foundation, and it's not possible to dispute that some of that necessarily helps the Foundation pay the salary of Bitcoin's lead developer. You can say it's indirect and miniscule and barely meaningful, but it's TRUE. And it's worth taking into consideration before paiting Mt. Gox in a particular light.
To be clear, I think Karpeles is an idiot who should be hounded out of our community and out of the Foundation. But I think fair's fair.

What do you suggest we should do about blockchain size? You know it will just keep growing, right? That's how Bitcoin works. Even with pruning, miners would have to store the whole thing. It sucks, but it's not a conspiracy.
The shit we read about the foundation on this subreddit nowadays is borderline pathological.

Using the blockchain for file sharing would immediately *destroy* its usefulness. If someone uploads the latest Game of Thrones episode in full HD, that's 4 gigabytes that all nodes have to store forever. Everyone has to store everything ever shared, forever. To say nothing of the kind of bandwidth that would require. If you think this is a good idea, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end this here.

It's worse than that - almost all miners are on pools, and pool miners don't need to run full nodes. So only pool operators run nodes, along with a fleeting crowd of transitory nodes of users starting and stopping their Bitcoin-Qt wallets, and a blessed but dwindling set of non-miners who run nodes just to help the network.

It's important to remember that investing means:


Source: 
In your case, you seem to have an expectation of capital appreciation. You may or may not have done any research or analysis - it would still be an investment. In an investment, the amount of risk typically correlates with the amount of potential gains. For Bitcoin, the amount of risk is crazy - actually, let me repeat that:
**THE AMOUNT OF RISK IS CRAZY**
But there exists remote, but somewhat plausible or imaginable outcomes where the positive results are equally crazy. Of course the probability that you will lose everything and spend years after feeling like an idiot is much bigger, but you know this going in. Do as much research as you can and make up your own mind, and remember rule number one: never invest more than you can afford to lose.
As for altcoins, I have no opinion except I would be even more careful.

Not all centralized digital currencies are cryptocurrencies. The "crypto" in "cryptocurrency" means something. I agree that there could be a centralized cryptocurrency, such as Chaum's DigiCash, but just because a centralized currency is managed on computers doesn't automatically make it a cryptocurrency (if it did, we could say the Dollar is a cryptocurrency).
Although to be fair, Wikipedia's definition of cryptocurrency specificially lists decentralization as one of the core features.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:50:59

What you call "market regulation" is not *necessarily* the result of people acting in their own interest. Selfish behavior isn't always good. If all billionaires agreed to donate a small part of their fortunes to cure disease and feed all the hungry people, the result would probably be enormous economic growth that would make those billionaires even richer in the long term - so why doesn't that happen? For the same reason that your idea will never happen.
Bitcoin has worked well so far because its incentives have been aligned with people's self-interest. It has been compatible with selfishness. When these two forces are aligned, Bitcoin can work. But GHash is showing signs that there are cases where they are *not* aligned. If this is not fixable from a technical perspective, Bitcoin will fail, because it is flawed. And because it is flawed, it must be *allowed* to fail, and be replaced by something new where incentives *are* aligned with selfishness.
*That*, to me, is free markets in action - it's unstoppable, it just happens by itself. Your philanthropic idea is nice, but fundamentally violates one of the strongest human urges: greed.

I think the number of daily transactions over time is much more interesting if you want to gauge bitcoin uptake. The number of unconfirmed transactions is mostly a measure of miner good-will. Six months ago, we weren't in this stupid situation we have today, where at least two major pools refuse to make large blocks. The worst one won't make any blocks larger than 48 kilobytes, usually accounting for around a hundred transactions. GHash only recently started making slightly larger blocks in some cases. This behaviour leaves the unconfirmed pool (mempool) larger at most times. It's not a good sign for the bitcoin network.

I doubt it can meaningfully be classified as a cryptocurrency; it's just a centralized digital currency, if it's not just basically a giftcard system. However, it *will* probably be seen as an improvement over bitcoin. This is always the trend in decentralized systems. Decentralization is hard to do well, because it's so much more complex than centralized systems and there's often no company behind it that stands to profit from polishing the experience.
So we used to have things like RSS to subscribe to web events, which was completely decentralized, but now we have Twitter. We used to have XMPP/Jabber for instant messaging, where anyone could run a node, but now we have Skype and Facebook. We used to have email where anyone could run a node, but now everybody just uses gmail (OK, we still have email, but the trend is clear). We used to have NNTP/newsgroups where everyone could run a node, but now we have reddit. We used to have a diverse multitude of companies running the internet, but now we have a handful of backbone providers who continue to merge.
It's easy to think that decentralization comes along to save the day as in Napster being replaced by BitTorrent, but in reality it's more often the opposite: new categories of network services start out as wonderfully decentralized until they get popular enough, at which point the big boys replace it with a centralized service.
This is why I don't like the focus on Bitcoin as a more effective payments network with low fees. It is, but it's easy to imagine a company offering a centralized service to provide even better efficiency with even lower fees. Instead we must focus on the real strength of bitcoin: an alternative asset completely neutral of any one organization, with predictable scarcity and censorship resistance.

The hack really hurt their reputation, especially because they handled it poorly from a PR perspective. Other than this, they seem like a good company very comparable to BitPay from a technical perspective. Being based in Denmark, they may be more suitable for European clients. BitPay has had issues with transferring fiat overseas due to new restrictions from American banks (search bitcointalk for this, I don't have the link handy but there's a thread about it there).

I don't buy this idea that miners will move away from pools as they become too popular. If that were the case, it would already be happening, but instead we see shit like this.

Yes, they could do this with probably a couple of billion dollars. It would be completely deniable, and if they wanted to, they could essentially shut Bitcoin down in this way, at least temporarily - but that would destroy confidence in Bitcoin, so it would be over.
Note that the cost of this attack just keeps going up and up quite fast. In the early days they could have done it with three potatoes and some wire, and in a few years (if Bitcoin survives) it could take most of the defense budget.

You can't transfer fiat to American or European banks from Mt. Gox. Even JPY withdrawals are slowing down a lot these days. If you sell on Mt. Gox, your fiat will likely be stuck there indefinitely. That's why the price is so high there, because what you're suggesting does not work.

That would mean there is someone who guarantees that you'll be able to exchange a bitcoin for "security and computer power".
"Backing" isn't just something arbitrary that happens to give users reason to trust their money, it's some alternative asset that actually exists in an amount proportional to the number of money units, and that holders of the money can exchange for it. The intention is that if the money fails, they can switch to that other asset. Bitcoin's computer power does not work like this.

The single most useful contribution in this regard right now would be for GHash.io to start making blocks that are larger than 243kB. Take a hint from Eligius and BTC Guild. Raising the block limit would do little when GHash.io are so powerful and make so small blocks.
Edit: But the issue of block size if much more complex than what you suggest. Developers don't agree what the best long-term solution is, but most seem to agree that just adding a few megabytes when it seems to be needed is too simplistic and could have far-reaching negative consequences.

The premium was due to dollar withdrawal being essentially impossible, and then eur withdrawal becoming increasingly harder. Buying bitoin was the only option for most users to withdraw any money. The premium wasn't simply due to Mt. Gox being popular, it was due to Mt. Gox being broken. When bitcoin withdrawal was no longer possible, that effect went away. Now their users wanted to *sell* bitcoins instead of bying, because if Mt. Gox really went under, they figure they have a better legal recourse as fiat holders than as bitcoin holders.

"Without permission" doesn't mean you're breaking laws and hiding money. It means you don't need to go to anyone to do what you want to do. There is no PayPal you have to go to and ask permission.

Withdraw from Mt. Gox via wire transfer? How wonderfully absurd.
Listen, son, forget about Mt. Gox arbitrage; the price is so high there precisely because **arbitrage doesn't work**. Your fiat is trapped there, indefinitely.
Edit: And if your account isn't verified, any bitcoins you send there will be trapped as well, and they've essentially stopped verifying accounts now.

The downside is that Bitcoin loses the properties of being trust-free and distributed. Now you have to trust that Ghash.io will continue to be benevolent and not cheat or discriminate, and Bitcoin now has a central point that stormtroopers can raid.

I also doubt that we can trust "the market" to do anything about this at all. Perhaps this is simply Bitcoin's Achilles' heel.

I don't know what you think "the market" is, but I can tell you it's not some benevolent universal force that keeps a watchful eye on us and rights all wrongs. Market psychology is not a straightforward subject, and the market will do what the market will do. In many cases, if set up correctly, those things are good things. But other times they are utterly [self-destructive](

Just a nitpick, feel free to ignore.
There is nothing to "decrypt" in Bitcoin, because there's no encryption involved. Instead, Bitcoin relies on hashing and signing. SHA-512 is not used, but SHA-256 is used, and this is the hashing algorithm. It's not enough to simply break this; you need to break double-SHA-256 if you want to cheat at mining, and you need to break both SHA-256 and RIPEMD160 (a completely different hashing algorithm) if you want to begin to steal money from other people (the next step would be to break ECDSA, used for signing).

We can't fix CEX.io. I think we just have to cling to the hope that this will be a wake-up call to other pools. They need to start competing on user-friendliness, and on fees. There is a good opportunity now for someone to capitalize on skepticism against CEX.io.

Bitcoin's point isn't to hide illegalities. And even if it were, the answer to your question would be "Why do you lock the bathroom door? What the hell are you doing in there??"
Bitcoin is political at heart. It's an expression of a dissatisfaction with contemporary monetary policy based on inflation. It's a radical approach that takes tools of monetary policy out of all men's hands, and leaves it up to a predictable algorithm, believing that predictable supply deflation is preferable to unpredictable inflation.
If you share this view, or even if you are just a little skeptical towards central banks, then Bitcoin may make sense for you.

Monetary backing means there is something "in the back", something behind each money unit, something that is another asset, and not an abstract idea. Something that gives us faith in the money, because we know that if this money fails, we can just go and exchange it for that other asset and no value has been lost.
So bitcoin has no backing even if you point to hashing power, same as the dollar has no backing even if you point to "the full faith and credit of the American government".
Yes, mining power gives us reason to have faith that bitcoin works, but if bitcoin fails, it gives us no recourse, unlike for instance gold backing.

Welcome to Bitcoin! It's always interesting to hear how people discovered it. We are all kinds of people here, in fact there are almost a hundred thousand of us just in this subreddit alone. We have all kinds of opinions, and manners. Don't let that discourage you.
You've looked, and found it out for yourself: there *are* no faucets anymore. Some guy posted here yesterday saying he had worked faucets for three weeks and earned fifty cents worth of bitcoin. It's effectively unspendable because of the large amount of small inputs as well.
There was a time when bitcoins were free (in 2010, faucets gave away 5 bitcoins to anyone who asked, with no work, just click a button, here's your five bitcoins). It's not like that anymore; looking for free bitcoins will just waste your time. If you want bitcoins, buy them or work for them, but just forget about all those "free bitcoin" sites.
Also, people who decide to "wait for the drop" before they buy, has been known to wait a very long time.
If you think the dogecoin community is nice today, I can tell you that the Bitcoin community was the same when it was that young. No community can stay that way as it grows. It's not a reflection of bitcoin, it's just the way online communities work.

You're making strong statements about bitcoin just to see if people will tell you if they are correct or not - this wastes everybody's time. This particular thread is a very technical one; if you want to learn about Bitcoin there are places and posts where that's fine. Just reading people's comments is a fine way to learn too, you don't have to participate, especially not by *pretending* you know stuff.

No, I never said that. I said I Bitcoin could fail from centralization *period*. It would necessarily lose all of its value, because it turns out it doesn't really work as expected. People aren't going to start selling preemptively in order to "regulate" pools. People will sell because they expect the price to drop, not because they want to "help". If Bitcoin really depends on collective altruism, it will fail, and must be allowed to do so - *that* is "the market".

But how does this relate to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:18:11
Clients won't accept invalid blocks, and won't forward them either. So if you make an invalid block it will propagate much slower through the network because non-colluding nodes (whether they are miners or not) won't pass the block on. And since clients won't accept your blocks, the remaining miners who make valid blocks will win.
The miners you collude with to make invalid blocks will accept your invalid blocks, and the blockchain will fork. You have essentially created an altcoin at that point, while the real bitcoin lives on just fine.

Bitcoin is really designed to be a closed system where people pay others in btc, who then take that btc and spend it on other things without legacy currency ever being involved.

I'm not sure, but it seems like you are arguing that bitcoin could fail because of a [deflationary spiral]( (read that link for why that might not necessarily happen)
Otherwise, it seems like you are making an argument that bitcoin could fail for whatever reason, and therefore holding large amounts of it is risky. This is true, but I think that the longer bitcoin survives, the stronger reason there is to trust it. For instance, I would be more comfortable holding a large amount (as in dollar-value) of btc today that I would in the summer of 2009, say. And if bitcoin still exists and works in five years, I would be much more comfortable with it than today. Etc.

Also, just having an ad there is good even if you never hear from anybody. It makes us less dependent on exchanges, which are vulnerable to government interference. And it makes bitcoin available to more people.

It's hard to articulate. Their questions are often phrased in ways that show they are trying to use bitcoin without knowing *anything* about it. There's something "off" about their sentence structure. Often there are spelling or grammar mistakes, or other signs the posts were written by someone who really likes drugs.
In this particular case, things like "Moneygram sent me an email saying the money got to my bitcoin address" definitely set me off. It's clearly his first time trying bitcoin, and he hasn't done much research before diving in, and he doesn't even know enough about the world of money to tell BitInstant and Moneygram apart.
Basically, if you're interested in bitcoin in such an early stage of the technology as today, it is either because 1) you're genuinely curious about them, believe in them or are fascinated by their implementation and potential, *or* 2) you want drugs. Some rare people may fall into both groups, but most people fit very obviously into one of them.

The popular theory goes that if unpopular changes are made to the protocol, miners won't adopt them. If the devteam is replaced like that, someone would probably fork the project and continue the existing blockchain, assuming that the fork would be seen as legitimate by the miners.
To me, the bigger worry is that at a trillion dollar market cap, the smartest evildoers in the world would start to look really, *really* closely at the bitcoin source code. A single vulnerability could be worth unimaginable sums.

I'm not an economist, but I play one on Deflation happens whenever money demand is higher than supply. This is not only caused by lost bitcoin, or a lower reward rate, but also happens as bitcoin is used by more and more people for more and more things. Each btc will be in higher demand, and so its price goes up. It can also happen because we're such greedy hoarders - all the btc sitting in your cold storage does not contribute to supply. And so in a small way, the value appreciation a hoarder expects becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

He has a point that bitcoin could become worthless in an instant if a sufficiently serious vulnerability in the crypto or the protocol is found. But he disregards the strength of the crypto involved, and that said crypto is also used to secure online banking, e-commerce, stock trading and much more. If bitcoin's crypto is ever broken, it basically means we don't have working crypto in this world.
Then he gets into a land of confusion, suggesting that some users having malware could take the whole Bitcoin economy down with it. And he suggests that Bitcoin's crypto could be bruteforced, which shows an embarassing lack of understanding, or a lack of appreciation for the length of "millions of years".
Now, protocol attacks could happen. AFAIK, there have been theoretical attacks that have been addressed already, preemptively. And he's right that there are probably über geniouses working around the clock on attacking the protocol. Every new day they remain unsuccessful gives Bitcoin more credibility.
He gets into facepalm territory when he suggests that one drug seller being busted could unravel all of Bitcoin and crash it to worthlessness. And when he suggests that Bitcoin's successor should be kept secret and centrally managed "by someone", it's … ah, forget about it.
You know what? It must be extremely confusing for people like Dan Seitz to see something like Bitcoin going on and on year after year, appreciating in value and becoming more and more popular, when they think it's built on such extremely fragile foundations. It's like an old man watching kids building a sand castle and it gets higher and higher and when it's 30 meters tall he dryly remarks that it'll crumble any day now.

Lots of people have tried, but an alternative blockchain has never caught on. If someone with significant clout were to try, they'd have to fight perceptions that it was "their" network. Bitcoin's strength is its independence; it would be hard for a "GoogleCoin" to compete with that.

There are enormous computation powers around on various campuses. We don't know that they're not being used for bitcoin mining of course, but I certainly hope they aren't. These supercomputers are there for a reason – running huge physics simulations, looking for medical cures, solving mathematical problems to support research, etc. Not only is the equipment very expensive, but operating it is very expensive as well (power consumption, personnel, etc). These are publicly funded resources which are supposed to be used for research, not for turning a profit by doing work that has little to do with advancing the state of science.

This is the correct answer. There are many good people in the Bitcoin community (including *you personally*, dear reader, so please don't downvote), but it also attracts zealot weirdos of the worst kind. Just look at the clown yesterday who announced that Python.org will soon accept bitcoin donations, and then he initiated a spectacular spam campaign against them thinking he could harass them into doing this, which resulted in them adopting an official policy of not accepting bitcoin, with the director publicly announcing that he *never* wants to hear about bitcoin again. Then look at the pointless Wikipedia campaigns being orchestrated from these days. It's so frustrating to see. And it probably almost completely explains people's venomous opposition to bitcoin.

I think you said in the video that you had experienced being temporarily blocked from the API because you polled too often. That's why you set the interval to 5 minutes instead of 1 minute or whatever. Using the websocket service, you'll basically get a continuous stream of price changes. You don't have to look at *every* number, but you'd be free to look every 10 seconds or 1 minute or whatever.
I think I understand why you only need the price every five minutes or so, and in that case polling the API would be fine and use less bandwidth too. But it's good to be aware of all possibilities :-)

You're asking two questions: "How do you keep your bitcoins safe and anonymously?" and "What is the most safe option to store my bitcoins?"
I'll only answer the first. My wallet is encrypted using the client's encryption feature. I back it up to many places, and all backups have additional AES encryption (for paranoia's sake since normal wallet encryption still allows people to see the balance if they get hold of the file). I also use only Linux, keep it up to date with security fixes, and try to keep my machines reasonably secure in general.

Please help others by telling us how this happened. Was your password weak? Did you reuse it on other sites, and if so, what kinds of sites?
My advice for keeping your Mt Gox account safe: use a strong password (&gt;8 characters, mixed case, numbers, special symbols, nothing resembling a word (and l33tsp3ak is pointless)). Use Google Authenticator for a second factor. If you have a smartphone, you can do this. It's free and there's *no* excuse not to. Set Mt Gox up to require it both for login and for transactions. You may find it inconvenient at first, but getting robbed is even more inconvenient.
I understand you're frustrated, but there's really not much Mt Gox can do. They have gone to great lengths to give users the tools to make their accounts safe, but in the end it's up to the users themselves.

They can't break AES, of course, but they don't need to.
At first, China blocked Tor simply by blocking access to all Tor nodes. Easy, because every Tor node was available publicly as a handy list of IPs and port numbers.
So then, Tor introduced [bridges]( which are ordinary nodes except they aren't announced anywhere. You can get such a list by word of mouth, or by asking The Tor Project through email or whatever.
This is when China stopped playing around and introduced their current DPI scheme against Tor. Bridges are now useless in China.
I'm not intimately familiar with what exactly they do, but they can recognize an SSL handshake followed by certain dataflows that seem untypical of browsing. If it is flagged as suspicious, they actually create their own connections to the IP/port using a Tor client, thereby confirming its status as a Tor node, and immediately blocking it. As a result, a secret node that has never been used anywhere before, will be blocked within 10 minutes of the first person in China accessing it.
See [the full report]( or [the summary](
I also highly recommend [the "How governments have tried to block Tor" talk]( if you haven't seen it.
The only hope for using Tor within China today seems to be to use [obfsproxy]( I haven't tried that myself, because thankfully I have no need for it, but as far as I understand, this is highly experimental and not something most people will be able to use.

As far as the blockchain is concerned, it manages transactions of bitcoin between addresses, and that's all.

You need to do that through other channels.

6. Oh, it's not really Credit Mutuel Bank, it's some other thing with a similar name. But still, every account holder gets their own IBAN!

I think that's what you try to address with your "some sort of system" to get "some sort of verification", but this is a critical issue that cannot be solved by hand waving.

It's a **JOKE**, guys, lighten up.
"Nobody" wants to buy Facebook stock - that's the whole point. Since nobody wants them, they are worthless. But the people who are unfortunate enough to own them, won't take your bitcoin for them because bitcoin is even *more* worthless. Get it now? Haha. It's not *true*, of course (people buy FB at $26 and BTC at $13.4), but if you're the kind of person who thinks "buttcoins" is the most hilarious pun since "two peanuts walked into a bar and one was a salted", this stuff is comedy gold.

The current source on github *is not a released version*. The VERSION constant has to have some value, and it's no longer 0.7.2, and it's not yet 0.8. It's **work in progress**, not a release. There is no 0.7.99 release.


You were, by calling the *current* version for "the old version" and the unreleased development branch on git for "the new version" - to a newbie who knows so little about bitcoin that he thinks he can sync the whole chain in two hours.


The fact that you would automatically think "he must mean the unreleased, highly unstable git development branch" when he was talking about "the wallet from weusecoins.com" is very strange to me, and lead me to believe you might be directing a lot of newbies to install compilers and git clients and this unfinished bitcoin client still under heavy research will be their first, horrible impression of bitcoin.
It was certainly true in this specific case. You told him he is using "the old version" and not "the new version" which is much better. You may not have intended that, fine.

This document is about drug abuse and has a focus on chemical properties etc. Not very relevant to either bitcoin or economics in general. Bitcoin discussion is limited to one paragraph:


was available for purchase online for around £5-10 for 250mg, and &gt;£3500 for 1kg
(manufacturer prices unknown). As of 30/8/12 five purported UK based sellers were
offering methoxetamine for sale on the Silk Road website (an „anonymous‟
marketplace accessed using the Tor „hidden service‟ browser). Prices ranged from
1.82 Bitcoins (1 Bitcoin [฿] ~£7 at the time of writing) for 500mg to 104.24 ฿ for 50g.
Sellers purportedly based in China and the USA were offering the opportunity to
purchase 1kg of methoxetamine for around 500 ฿. This indicates a trade outside of
those normal routes of access and purchase. According to some drug services street
prices are currently around £15-20/g.

There is no 0.7.99 version. It's just a running codename for "this will one day become 0.8.0". Check out the branches and tags on github - every version is tagged, but there is no 0.7.99. On a historical list of all Bitcoin versions, you will never see 0.7.99. There is no 0.7.99. Newbies should not be directed to using 0.7.99. You won't find a download of 0.7.99. There simply is no 0.7.99. I don't know how to be any clearer about the nonexistence of 0.7.99. The current version of Bitcoin is 0.7.2. There will never be a 0.7.99 release.
For GOD's sake, I said **there is no 0.7.99**!!! I *agree* that waiting for 0.8.0 sucks, but 0.7.2 is the current version of Bitcoin and if you seriously expect newbies to clone the master branch of a git repository, figure out how to compile it and report bugs, and keep it updated from day to day, you're **delusional**. There **IS NO 0.7.99 VERSION.**
Oh **FOR CRYING OUT LOUD**, do you really want to play the "but look at bitcoin.org" game?? So **LOOK** at it! It says right there. "Latest Bitcoin-Qt version: 0.7.2".

It's anonymous as in it not leaving a banking system trail, and there's no obvious tie-in to authorities. Compare it to using Mt. Gox and you see what I mean. So you get that level of anonymity for free. Beyond that, you can access the site through Tor and be quite anonymous, even to the LocalBitcoins.com administrators. Finally, running your bitcoin payments through them is optional, but even if you do, Bitcoin can be quite anonymous in itself, if used correctly.

There's an easier way than that. First, start by shutting down the internet in the Northern hemisphere. If the hidden service becomes unavailable, now you know which hemisphere it's in. Now turn the internet back on in the Western half of the Northern hemisphere.

1) They can choose between dumping large amounts at once, crash the market and get pocket change, or sell gradually so the market is not significantly affected, and get lots of money. People generally don't say no to money.
2) People may hoard, but bitcoin's properties as a payment system may make it too convenient not to spend any. Bitmit.net is doing fine, and Silk Road pulls crazy volumes. But in general a deflationary currency may tend to encourage saving instead of spending, which may not always be a bad thing.
3) It's not good that MtGox is that big. I wish their competitors were more popular. If you agree, try to not use MtGox if you can help it.

I don't know, I can sympathize a little. I remember clearly the day in 2010 when I stumbled upon bitcoin.org. I'm a computer scientist, software developer, liberalist, and quite into peer-to-peer technologies and whatever supports freedom of speech. But when I read about Bitcoin, all I could think is it seemed like a very silly idea and it could never amount to anything. (If instead I had started mining then, I could have retired by now!)
Back then, you couldn't even get a pizza for all the bitcoin in the world, so it seemed harmless. But if real money were involved, and I were a more ignorant and kneejerky person, I could easily imagine thinking "scam".
Next time it came up in the technews, I read more about it and I slowly came around. I think most people will need to go through this process (because Bitcoin is *so* different and strange, yet it works), and we should be patient, polite and constructive towards them.

Ok. Enabling the network to send mail could be a real challenge. Through Tor or not, you still need a mail server, which becomes a very fragile central point. And how are you going to receive replies?

Thanks for trying to get this message across, although it'll cost you karma. I used to believe all the claims that the number of decimal places is more or less just a setting in the source code. When I read up on how the protocol works, I was very surprised to find out how it works. It will be no easy task to change this. It's a "hardfork" and may effectively result in an alternative, forked currency unless there is and exceptional degree of consensus and coordination across the community, which may become harder and harder as that community grows.

Ok, I will amend my statement: if you want to get into bitcoin, don't think mining is something you need to do as part of it. Get your first coins in other way (buy them or sell something for them), and learn how to use them. And then later, if you want to, you can decide to get into the exciting world of mining.
I think some people jump into mining at once, and after having mined for 20 minutes with their laptop Celeron CPU and didn't become a billionaire instantly, they conclude that bitcoin is too hard and go away. I would rather play down the importance of mining for incidental newbies.

Yes, it is a lottery. If you have one lottery ticket (meaning you make one attempt at solving the block), you currently have a 0.000000000000006377% chance of winning it. As you can see, this number is very low, so you need to get more lottery tickets. **A LOT MORE**.
People with ASICs have billions of more lottery tickets than you.
Sure you *could* get lucky and win on your first lottery ticket, or on the ten thousandth. But if you believe you have a chance at that, chances are you are in the habit of buying actual lottery tickets and believing you'll hit the jackpot any time now.

The problem is that newbies who end up trying to go ultimate paranoid have no idea what they're really trying to do, and end up losing lots of money. Most people are like this; it's not that they're not smart, it's that IT security is notoriously hard to get right, *especially* where actual money is involved.
I am convinced that Bitcoin's future is one where *most* people trust their money to someone who specialize in keeping them safely, such as Coinbase. Because *most* people don't worry so much about government confiscation etc. Bitcoin is great because it fits anyone's threat model - if you want to keep your own money so that nobody can get at them, you still can.

Besides keeping and sharing the blockchain, running a full but non-mining node means that you also participate in propagating transactions. This helps Bitcoin work: miners alone are incentivized to keep high-fee transactions to themselves, so that only they can reap the fees if they happen to solve a block. But when other people also distribute transactions, there is no point is behaving like that.

It is the cumulative depth chart. Moving your mouse over it will give you more information. The value axis for the cumulative depth chart is on the left, enumerated in BTC. 
About the bars going up and down (if there are any at the moment). They show market depth changes over the last 10 minutes. The value axis for them is on the right (BTC). Bars on the left of the current price are bid offer changes, and on the right ask offer changes. So if somebody is adding a bid offer, you will see a green bar up on the left. About colors: if bids are added they are in green, and when removed they are in red. For asks it's the opposite. That's because when somebody is adding an ask, it makes it harder for the price to go up (red). If somebody is removing an ask it's easier for the price to go up (green).

It takes a lot to spam transactions, because fees literally make it expensive. Mastercoin was set to become a global organization dedicated to performing this spamming by using crowdfunding from people incentivized by profit. You could look at that as a vulnerability, but it's a strange one because it requires the consent of so many - you're essentially promised money for destroying Bitcoin. After the flagging feature this consent will be much harder to generate [1], and also the more important Bitcoin becomes, the less incentivized people will be to destroy it.
[1] And also you would have to be actively and honestly evil and open about being out to destroy Bitcoin, which makes you very popular. The Mastercoin project might seem like they were evil, but in all honesty I think they have other motives than destroying Bitcoin.

It's provoking. Even after 45 minutes with no blocks, if Asicminer finally finds one, they will include like 30-40 transactions while thousands of transactions go unconfirmed.
I guess they have a "fiduciary responsibility" to maximize their profits, and smaller blocks propagate faster so has a slightly higher chance of winning. But it's sad how the darlings of Bitcoin's industry are often those working against its interests (Asicminer barely confirms transactions, SatoshiDice spams the blockchain mindlessly).

But nobody's arguing that opposite. Nobody disagrees that the foundation should provide some assistance to local chapters. It's almost pointless to argue that they should, because of course they should - that's what being an organization with local chapters *does*. It's so self-evident that it's almost hard to argue *for*, so she has to invent that buzzterm, which only confuses the issue in a very politician-like manner that rubs me the wrong way.


The appeal of her experience is that there is so little of it? Come on.
**Edit**: I realize that part of my response was out of context - of course that's not what you *meant*. I sort of get what you mean, I just struggle to find substance. She is passionate - about what? She can navigate political systems - ok, good I guess? She wants to educate key people, that's nice.


No, does *anybody*? Again there are nobody taking the opposite position, because it's so incredibly self-evident. That's what I mean when I say her speeches seem so empty to me. If somebody holds a half-hour speech about the sky being blue and water being wet, I'm not only bored - I'm a bit angry because my time is wasted and there are real issues to be discussed.


Of course that's a caricature - my point is that people seem to really like her because of her experience and the impression that she comes from high places, and I just find it to be a stretch, and I find other candidates have more interesting and relevant experience - which they also were able to present in a way that seemed so very much more honest and natural than Ploshay's robotic manuscript performance.

Mining is not a newbie game any longer, and it's *especially* not a game you play with a Pentium 4 CPU. That might have worked in 2010. Today you need a specialized and hard-to-get device called an ASIC. If you want bitcoins, and there is every reason to want some, then buy them.
@_date: 2013-03-24 12:12:22
You didn't buy earlier because you had no faith in Bitcoin, and you seem to still don't, so it's not clear what that place between a rock and a hard place is.
My own feeling is that short to medium term, the price could go anywhere, and quite likely down. It's just impossible for anybody to know. But longer term (years) I think Bitcoin will somehow work out to some notable degree, despite all its current challenges (general scalability issues including block size). If the price were to tumble catastrophically tomorrow, into the single digits, I would sit stoically in my chair, and perhaps buy some. I know I would, because I've already done that once.
What would you do in that situation, if you had bought now (at $65)? Perhaps you would panic sell, and lose a lot of money, because the side of you still thinking "Bitcoin is just a trend" wins out?
Honestly, don't listen to me or anyone else here. This subreddit is full of people who try to get you to buy, because that's in their own interest. Do your due diligence, teach yourself as much about Bitcoin as possible, both technical details and trying to understand fundamentals of the economy. Then make a decision based on that.

The ashes that media uses to save its own butt. They widely declared Bitcoin as "dead" after the price crash in 2011, but then when Bitcoin just kept on working and even started gaining value again, suddenly it was all about "rising from the ashes" and how "baffled" everybody was, and the odd phoenix here and there. It looks like this is starting again now (we might just entering the "bitcoin is dead" phase). Perhaps it will even be a regular thing, that bitcoin will continue to "die" every two years.

*That* is the price you pay for hefty returns two or three years later. Lots of people did exactly that, and today they finally dare to sleep a bit at night.

Yes, mining is a central part of what makes Bitcoin work. Without the mining process, Bitcoin would have essentially zero security. You would be able to do things like spend your money twice. Mining blocks and chaining the blocks together (into the blockchain) really is what's new in Bitcoin compared to previous schemes. Many older digital currency schemes got their security from a central server which managed all the transactions - but this server could be shut down by authorities or other attackers, and it required all the user to trust that the server operator was honest. Mining allows Bitcoin to have no such central point, and as a user you essentially don't have to trust anyone. That's pretty cool.

The faster the blocks are produced, the higher the probability that two miners create blocks almost simultaneously. Only one of them will get on the chain, and the other will be orphaned - discarded, wasted work. But what's worse, a part of the network may not know this, and continue to mine on top of the orphan. People with transactions in the orphan block may feel quite safe, and meanwhile yet another block is added to the "real" chain. When the out-of-date miners finally learn about this, they have to discard the orphan blocks. Suddenly your transactions, which used to be "confirmed" as far as you knew, no longer are.
This happens in Bitcoin frequently, but due to the 10-minute target it's not that bad. A two-minute target makes this much, much worse. And then you have some altcoins with like 20 second targets. This is just chaos.

**Pirated copy of the article since it's been deleted:**
It’s almost impossible for the average computer to mine Bitcoins in any efficient way, hence the rise of Bitcoin mining machines so tuned to their specific purpose that they barely resemble PCs. To wit: the Cryonic Bitcoin FrostBit machine is a PC in name only and contains a liquid nitrogen generator, special ASIC chips, and a price tag that would make the Winklevii twins think twice.
“It’s the first time a ‘PC’ has been built for consumers with built-in liquid nitrogen generators. We use helium compression technology to super-cool condensers that in turn condense nitrogen air into its liquid form. There’s nothing even remotely similar available to the consumers,” said CEO of Cryoniks, Inc. Fahad Koumaiha. “By sustaining cryonic temperatures we were able to achieve superconductivity with our custom designed ASIC processors. Not only do we get a huge boost in speed, but we cut down power consumption to around 2800W per unit; significantly less than anything on the market today.”
The PC hits a peak of 2800W – the average PC hits 200W on a bad day – but the device can perform 1000 Gigahashes a second. To put that in perspective a strong PC with good graphics card can hit about 100 GH/S and in my experience I haven’t been able to get any my machines to hit higher than 50 GH/S.
What are you going to pay for this ridiculous machine? Try a cool $15,000, which, sadly, you can’t pay for in BTC.
Can this thing really pay for itself? Probably, but not immediately. There are some BTC fans who believe a $10,000 BTC isn’t too far off and if that happens the potential benefits of this machine far outweighs the cost. They are planning on shipping this monster in July so if you’re seriously into mining, it may be worth a look. Everyone else? Be satisfied with your low GH/S. It’s a cryonic, nitrogen-cooled world out there and we’re just visiting.

Not necessarily a large amount of addresses, but a large amount of outputs from transactions received. It doesn't matter if they were received at the same address or to separate ones; each one has to become an input to a new transaction when they are spent, and this is what makes the transaction big, and therefore expensive.

It's a good question. The usual come-back here is that the regular financial system is much more resource-intensive. I don't know if that is a fair comparison given the difference in size.
But Bitcoin might not primarily compete against the regular financial system, but against precious metals, especially gold. And if you look into [how gold mining is done these days]( it's just horrible and devastates the environment with mercury. If Bitcoin could replace that, the net effect might be very positive.

I have to be careful not to come off as a self-gratuitous snob, but I'm surprised that this comment blows so many minds. It's completely true, but it's also completely obvious.
Bitcoin has taught me so many things, and one of them is that most people seem trapped in the status quo. It's not that they don't want change, it's that they can't *imagine* change. I noticed this first amongst Bitcoin's detractors; you typically hear them claim that Bitcoin has no future because they are hard to buy or few merchants accept them. You can basically reduce these arguments down to this: "The way things are today is how they will always be, and that's why Bitcoin will never work."
But this attitude exists inside the Bitcoin community as well, perhaps expressed slightly differently. We *hope* that Bitcoin can work, and some of us believe it is even plausible, but when it comes down to it, we are unable to think in terms that are meaningfully different from the status quo. It's a failure of imagination; it's a foul tendency to think in terms of small, incremental refinements instead of fundamental, layer-by-layer *changes*.
It's a sick pattern of thought that says our days of invention are past; a helpless yearning back to the days of Satoshi. This is how people think in dying empires. Our ambitions must be better than that.
We feel so smug because we think we understand Bitcoin, but if posts like that of surprise and delight us, we've stripped bare our lack of invention and, sorry to say this, our lack of understanding of Bitcoin.

You state it as a given that Litecoin is actually an improvement over Bitcoin, but you might find that this is a strongly contested claim.
PPCoin is flawed as far as being a Bitcoin competitor since it is [not decentralized](
If something that actually does improve on Bitcoin comes along (and I'm sure it will, sooner or later), it will be interesting to see where that leaves Bitcoin. Bitcoin, too, will improve over the years, and it's possible that it might pick up whatever new wisdom is given by the new cryptocurrency. If it's a really dramatic improvement over Bitcoin, I'm sure many would just switch over to it, leaving Bitcoin's value in the dust.

If you know a little bit about computers, you'll be able to use bitcoins. It doesn't hurt to read a little bit up on computer security.


Mining is over, you can't do it anymore. It's now only for people who have very special and expensive equipment which you can't get. Mining is *not* for newbies, just forget about it.


Depends on what you mean by getting started. If you mean just buying some bitcoin, check the prices and there you go. If you mean mining, the answer is thousands upon thousands of dollars, and you'll earn a few dollars in total. Just forget about it.


No, just forget about it.


It would severely cut down on the life expectancy of your computer, while at the same time earning you almost NOTHING. So just forget about it.
If you want bitcoins, buy them, work for them or sell something for them. Mining for newbies with home computers is over.

It's much like the "Bitcoin's exchange rate fluctuates wildly" meme. Suddenly it's $30, and five minutes later it's $2! That happened **ONCE**, you idiots!

It would probably be technically possible if you could get enough miners to agree to it, but it would mean you give up fungibility; the idea that one bitcoin is as good as any other bitcoin. You now have different classes of bitcoin, some more valuable than others. This makes bitcoin a lot harder to trade with, and makes their value completely unpredictable (what if this blockade power is ever used against my coins?), so the whole currency would probably collapse.

Verification is mainly done by miners. These are the people with powerful hardware who collect people's transactions and put them into *blocks* which are like small files. But it takes a *lot* of work to create a block that is *valid* in the eyes of all the other miners. If you happen to create a valid block, the whole network agrees that you are entitled to 25 brand new bitcoins. Not 50, and not a billion - *exactly* 25, and *only* if you are lucky enough to make a valid block. A new valid block is made on average every 10 minutes.
When a miner finds a block, he sends the block to all the other miners. Every single miner goes through the block and checks that it follows every rule in the bitcoin software. If it doesn't (for example if you assigned yourself 50 bitcoins instead of 25, or if you tried to cheat in any other way), they throw the block away and you get nothing.
The number of bitcoins a lucky miner gets is halved every four years. It used to be 50 until last year; now it's 25. In 2016 it will halve to 12.5, and so on until there are 0 bitcoins left to mine. At that point there will be around 21 million bitcoins in existence.
When you download the software you can choose to be a miner, but by default you will just receive blocks from miners and transactions from users. Mining used to be something anyone could do, but these days you need special and expensive hardware and you have to really know what you're doing.

You mean using SSL (HTTPS) on top of hidden services? The end-to-end encryption is already using SSL, and onion addresses are self-authenticated, so that overs all that HTTPS does. HTTPS really does not offer anything for hidden services, and that's why no hidden service offers HTTPS, so you can't use it even if you wanted to.
For regular websites, you should *absolutely* use HTTPS, but that's only because exit nodes can sniff your traffic.

Probably because the transaction is relatively big, as measured in bytes, because it requires a large number of inputs. To prevent blockchain spam, such large transactions require a higher fee.

Mining problems need to be hard to compute, but very easy to verify. The problems also need to be able to be scaled in difficulty, and the solution needs to have an inherent computational link to a previous solution (and this link also needs to be very easy to verify). I don't know much about protein folding, but I'm guessing that problem does not satisfy several of these requirements.
The closest anyone has come to incorporate some modicum of scientific purpose into the proof-of-work algorithm is Primecoin, which works on prime numbers. But even here the usefulness is questionable, I think.

The main worry from centralization is that the secret police have fewer doors to bust down and fewer people to disappear in order to harm the network. If six pools control the whole network, they can take down Bitcoin in an afternoon's coordinated action.
I don't worry a lot about this - when the police strikes, the actual mining members of the pools would just start solo-mine or set up new pools. But in the very short term, transaction processing could be set back.

I agree that XBT is not going to replace fiat – but it's going to go far and find its place in ways you cannot imagine.
I'm convinced that your scaling concerns will be addressed by techniques like off-the-chain transactions. Furthermore, there's a good place for Bitcoin as an asset on the level of gold.
We can live with and adapt to irreversibility - in fact we have for thousand of years already - cash is pretty irreversible. Reversibility of monetary transfer is a very recent phenomenon.
Usability concerns can absolutely be addressed. You had to be a computer genius to use the internet in 1994, and there were people who dismissed it on that basis, and your dismissal echoes of this to me.
To say that Bitcoin has reached its peak extension on a day when the price is going through the roof is not convincing, and I think your post is going to look rather amusing in a few years.

This is true. I think some sort of solutions that will allow Bitcoin to continue to work will be arrived on. The developers don't seem very worried.


It *could* become obsolete. Bitcoin could also adapt this mysterious new solution, or become the "silver" to this new currency's "gold". If you invested in Bitcoin you need to pay attention to these things.


Absolutely. That doesn't mean that the trend is not upwards, and that the upside potential is enormous.

Ploshay's replies annoyed me so much - if you can't speak without a manuscript, you have no business representing the Foundation. Especially if you can't even do it without sounding like a seventh-grader presenting her homework essay for class. Add to this that the content of her sterile speech boiled down to almost *nothing*. She keeps trying this "organized decentralization" talking point which she repeats again and again, which I find very patronizing. She has some kind brief experience as a low-level aide for some assistant to a secretary for a spokesman for a politician, so people go all like "OMG she's a former congresswoman or something, VOTEVOTEVOTE", so it's pretty clear she's going to win this, which is frustrating. At least she doesn't seem evil or anything, just a haplessly harmless young woman looking for more points for her resume. But we need something more. We need someone with dirt on their boots, someone with a deep understanding of the issues facing Bitcoin as well as of the crypto behind it. We need someone like Joerg Platzer.

They report on recent events. The whole world is not where we isolate ourself with people who are in strong agreement with us at all times; in the real world, a variety of opinion exists, and a variety of things happen. Positive things were reported there as well, where relevant (world's best performing hedge fund is a bitcoin fund etc). But lots of challenging things happened in the Bitcoin world recently, and of *course* they have to cover that. Not covering that and only covering your approved list of positive items - *that* would be propaganda.

If you used the encryption in Bitcoin-Qt, then only the private keys are encrypted.

Pruning or not - bootstrapping a pruning client is always going to involve downloading the full blockchain, even when that blockchain has become 10 gigabytes, 10 terabytes, and beyond. And the network is always going to rely on a large number of people storing and offering full, unpruned blocks, even when the blockchain is 100 terabytes and beyond. Sure that means that most people won't run full nodes anymore, but the question still is who will, and what will their motivation be.
I think when we meet such concerns by just yelling "pruning" we're doing a disservice - this *is* unknown territory, and we should be honest about that. Bitcoin will probably work one way or another in the long term, but the "how" is quite unclear.

Where would the money for this new payment come from, though? On an exchange, this would essentially amount to a free hedge. Buy 1000 BTC at 160, wait 30 minutes and if the price is 162, sell at a profit, but if the price is 158, ask for your money back. In the best case you got 2000 USD for free, and in the worst case you lost nothing.
Of course, whoever *sold* you the 1000 BTC can also get his money back within 30 minutes. So the exchange is essentially no longer an exchange, but a charity which hands free money to people in any amount they ask for.

Nobody knows where the price will go. It has gone up about 8000% just this year, but it could go down as much as well.

Jesus, that's the most common fallacy ever. **Having legal representation is not an admission of guilt!!** You're just a random person and you don't know much about the law or even the legal process (heck, you don't even know if you were arrested or not!), and you're up against an all-powerful adversary called the damn state. I don't care where you are, **the police are not your friends**.
They're trying to confiscate the equivalent of $140,000 from you, and you thought a lawyer would be a waste of money??
Did they even give you anything to document that you were brought in? Do you know what your legal status in the case is? Are you a suspect? A witness? Do you have *anything* to prove them wrong if they claimed you were never brought in?

I think it's definitely worth it for purposes of backup. It can obscure the fact that the file is a Bitcoin wallet, and if anyone manages to access the file, they won't be able to read its public keys and transaction history, and run brute-force attacks (even if that would be completely useless).

Larger block size means room for more transactions, but it doesn't automatically mean miners will have *incentive* to include more transactions. Adding low-fee or no-fee transactions makes the block bigger without any miner reward, and bigger blocks take longer to broadcast. If two or more miners find a block around the same time, the miner who can broadcast his block the fastest will win, and the others will orphan. So just to be safe, it's best to include as few transactions as possible, and only high-fee transactions.

I'm assuming you mean "affect the price" and not "effect the price". I think the effect will be minimal. There has been created around 8 blocks an hour lately, which is two more than normal. So the supply *may* have been a little higher. But I'm guessing this effect is negligible. In general there is no correlation between mining difficulty and price.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

The foundation pays the salary of the lead developer of the Bitcoin project, but there is no "voting" in any more direct sense; the Bitcoin reference software is developed by the core members of the Bitcoin project, which is independent of the foundation.
There is a lot of paranoia regarding the foundation, and so much of it is unfounded. At least acknowledge that you were wrong about the 10 minute confirmation time having been decided by the foundation.

I believe and predict that the solution will be trusted payment processors like BitPay and others, who front the confirmation risk for merchants so that payments can be immediate. A system of payment processors settling between each other on given intervals could also be a part of this, and could allow most smaller-value transactions to take place outside the blockchain. I predict that this is a degree of centralization that most bitcoin users will be comfortable with.

You're experiencing the limitations of the legacy monetary system - not of Bitcoin. Once you have bitcoins, moving them around is extremely easy and fast.
If buying bitcoins were easier, they wouldn't be this cheap. The price you pay for getting a bitcoin for only $800 is that you have to jump through more hoops.
It used to be much harder to buy bitcoins, if you can believe it - when bitcoins were even cheaper. You can wait a few years and they'll be *very* easy to get, but you'll pay a lot more.

If two miners solve a block at around the same time, there is race to distribute the respective blocks as fast as possible. The block that is distributed most slowly will become an orphan and lose. So in that sense, a faster network connection helps. But since your only motive is to contribute to bitcoin's security, this should be less of a motivation for you.
@_date: 2013-03-25 11:23:59

The argument is always "bitcoin will collapse as soon as they find out that X" (X may be "it's deflationary", "it's not anonymous after all", "there will be regulation", "there is no intrinsic value", "it's easy to buy but hard to sell", "there is some bad news", etc).
Bitcoin turns 5 in a few days. We've known about Bitcoin all that time and thought about it, discussed it, philosophized over it, and **used it**, all of that time. You'd think we'd find out about X by now?

I understand the mechanism of hardfork deployment and how consensus works, but I may not have given this enough thought. My impression has been that the number of decimal places has been anything but arbitrary, but rather hard-bounded by fundamental datatypes, making it extremely tricky to change. In addition, I'm provoked by people almost straight-out lying about bitcoins being "infinitely divisible". When I first started to study bitcoins, these people made me think that the number of decimal places must be more or less just a runtime option to bitcoind or a constant like MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, when it's anything but. People who want to pretend that Bitcoin was born super-perfect and without any thinkable flaws or quirks pisses me off. Denying reality is dangerous.
On the other hand, it is a good point that consensus around the *need* for extra decimal places should be no problem if it comes to that. And it won't come to that overnight; as you say this could be planned and deployed over years. And it's quite impressive what the devs are able to do. So I'm coming around.

That's impossible as long as the block limit is 1MB. That's a theoretical maximum of 51 GB per year.


Because that's how Bitcoin verifies transactions without having a central authority to trust. You don't *have* to download the whole blockchain; you can use a "lightweight" (SPV) client.


It *is* distributed across the network, in that every full node has the full blockchain ;-) But I know what you really mean, and the answer is that it is tricky to do this in a way that preserves the trust requirements, and it hasn't been needed so far, but the developers are thinking about this already.

It would probably be technically possible if you could get enough miners to agree to it, but it would mean you give up fungibility; the idea that one bitcoin is as good as any other bitcoin. You now have different classes of bitcoin, some more valuable than others. This makes bitcoin a lot harder to trade with, and makes their value completely unpredictable (what if this blockade power is ever used against *my* coins?), so the whole currency would probably collapse.

The bitcoin exchange market is relatively easy to manipulate, for anyone who has a few million dollars or the equivalent in bitcoins. Hence the ol'e legend of The Manipulator, sitting in his secret lair and pushing the market up, and down, and making money in both ends while he laughs maniacally.
I'm not sure what part bots play in this. I imagine its mostly evil humans who do it. Or just your common mass psychology. Many Bitcoin traders are notoriously inept (they are IT geeks, not economists), and this probably makes the market easier to play for experienced traders.
There are bots doing small (0.01 btc) trades constantly though, probably hoping for some manipulative effect by bouncing the "last" price between the edges of the spread.

Keep in mind that we get lots of people asking how to get "free money" around here. There's a prevailing misunderstanding that Bitcoin is money out of thin air that everyone can magically get tons of and it has lots of value. So when you post asking how to "earn free BTC", you're exposing yourself to a certain jadedness.
So I don't have much advice; to me it seems like most if not all of "free bitcoin" schemes pay out so little that you depend on Bitcoin's value to go up a hundred-fold in order to get a whole dollar's worth. Straight-out buying them is the simplest way to get bitcoins at this point, but I understand that not everybody has disposable money for this. Selling stuff on bitmit.net can earn you some money while also helping you get rid of stuff you don't need, but it could take a long time to find a buyer.

If you misconfigure your webserver so that for instance its 404 page includes a banner saying "Apache 2.0 running on 1.2.3.4", Tor isn't going to stop the webserver from serving that page. This is not a Tor protocol flaw no matter how you frame it.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

I'm not talking about those grand visions of inter-provider settlement protocols and whatnot, I'm just talking about the tipping service keeping track of what sum belongs to whom without registering it on the blockchain before the user transfers it out. It's exactly the same as Mt. Gox, Bitstamp and any other exchange does: when you buy or sell bitcoins, they don't move the bitcoins over to you in a blockchain transaction; they just update some table row in their internal database. I don't see why a tipping system needs to be different.

1) We always knew the blockchain would grow beyond where random users would want to or be able to store all of it. Those people can use SPV clients, which are basically as secure while not sacrificing decentralization.
2) We will eventually start using the standardized lesser units like mBTC. This is already supported in clients and its' not big deal. Keeping 1 BTC == $100, even if it were possible, would just mean the Bitcoin economy had stagnated.
3) Gavin is already sketching out how Bitcoin wallets running on desktops can be protected by two-factor authentication.

I can't imagine there are people who actually fear that someone will buy the Bitcoin project and kill it. How would that work? Bitcoin is released under the MIT license, which is functionally the same as the PostgreSQL license. Copyright belongs to each contributor, and not to any central organization.

"The way things are today, is how they always will be." – this is the essence of many expert criticism about bitcoin, and this one as well. It very sadly displays a lack of imagination. As an "expert" you're supposed to do something beyond just observing status quo.
"It's unstable, so it will never be able to work as a currency, it's just speculation". Yes it's speculation, it's a four-year-old currency being bootstrapped, it *needs* to go up in price in order to be useful and become stable.
This is like some galactic being observing the formation of our solar system. "Look at this! It's just a bunch of gases and particles clumping together into rocks that smash into each other! Have you ever seen anything like it?! And this flaming chaos is supposed to support *life*?? This will never work."

Thanks. I found more discussion [here](
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:36:04
At this point, asking for it to stabilize is asking for it to stagnate. It's a 10 billion dollar economy now (in theory, but in practice it's much smaller because of lost coins) - that's nothing, absolutely nothing. You have to accept that bitcoins are predictably scarce, and that means there will be a bootstrapping phase during which required price increase has to take place.
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:06:05
HTTP can be used as a currency? It's not a unit of account, it's not scarce, divisible, or fungible. Bitcoin is all those things, and it's pretty easy to recognize technologies that are those things. What seems silly to me is to suggest that SMTP or BitTorrent are currencies.

That's true, but trademarks, which again are not the same thing as copyrights, do explicitly **not** work that way. Trademarks have to be registered explicitly, and it has to be done by someone who is using the name in question for trade.

Is it possible that you are overcompensating for what you perceive as groupthink in this subreddit? I mean at one moment you appear to fatalistically doom Bitcoin and the next moment you appear to be arguing against yourself. I understand skepticism, but perhaps you are being irrationally skeptical to compensate for groupthink?
"Statistically possible" is not a useful term in cryptography; feasibility is. And you say you don't think brute-forcing is feasible, but you simultaneously warn against the government magically selling other people's bitcoins. I don't know what to make of that.
I agree that an "economical" attack is much more likely, but the kind of worries you seem to have, where people are essentially disappeared in the fog of night simply for being in possession of a small file called wallet.dat, are so entirely foreign to me and don't seem at all like a rational assessment.

So you want many people to use it, right? In order to spend bitcoins, they must first own bitcoins. In order to own bitcoins, they must acquire them. So you want many people to acquire bitcoins. This will drive the price up. The only way to keep it stable is to reduce the buying pressure, meaning you need to discourage people from acquiring bitcoins.
The unpopular fact right now is that because bitcoin needs to grow, and growing necessarily means increasing price and associated volatility, bitcoin right now is *much* better suited as a speculative investment than as money.
We want the same thing - we want bitcoin to be relatively stable because then it becomes more useful as money. The road there involved crazy price volatility. Perhaps in a few years, bitcoin will be more stable, because of this. You can't simultaneously want wide adoption *and* for bitcoin to remain a $10-billion economy (which is what "stability" means at this point).

Unfortunately, Bitcoin-Qt only encrypts the private keys in the wallet, meaning you can read everything else. So no password is required until you want to make a transaction.
Personally I wish there were an option to encrypt the whole damn thing, for two reasons:
* So that people who got ahold of your wallet.dat couldn't read your transaction history and see your addresses.
* So that you could "exercise" your password more often. If you forgot your password, this way you would have found out earlier and perhaps had a higher chance of recalling it.
But I've never found anyone who agrees with this or wants this. So when I backup my wallet.dat, I encrypt it with a separate tool just to get the security I'm after.

This is functionally identical to just moving numbers around in a database (what I call off-chain), except you're using the blockchain as that database - and the tipper have to pay the transaction fee as well.

  - **Egypt** is gunning down their civilians in the streets and is under military rule
  - **Iran** is in terrible economic shape after sanctions
* Asia is not the savior once hoped for:
  - **China's** growth is slowing and a property bubble is set to pop
  - **India** is drowning in debt and their currency is losing value fast
* **UKUSA** is dropping their all pretensions about not being police states
* Europe's troubles, despite what they're telling us, are not at all over
  - **Germany's** gold is being held hostage, or has been lost completely, by the Americans; the fallout from this is still up in the air but could become nasty
  - **Greece** starts talking about even more crises "loans", sees the rise of neo-nazis in their political system while unemployment reaches a stunning 27.6% and 65% for people between 15 and 24, now frequently talked about as "the lost generation"
  - **Spain** is not much different with unemployment
* South-American countries like **Argentina** and **Venezuela** are seeing double-digit inflation
* **Russia** is turning brutal against minorities, often a sign of trying to cover up the real problems
These are all deeply tragic stories; economic misturns are only parts the consequences, but ones which could allow Bitcoin to shine.

It seems strange to simultaneously declare that Bitcoin has no value and to also say that it's strange that people trade them for money. Something being exchangeable for something else is the *definition* of it having value.
Once they acknowledge this, it should be easy to argue bitcoin's usefulness, such as being able to almost instantly transfer value halfway around the world in the middle of the night when banks are closed.


This is true, however. Storing value in Bitcoin is not risk-free. When arguing for Bitcoin, it doesn't hurt to acknowledge that it's a pretty wild experiment, and while it has worked for over four years already and shows no sign of trouble, who knows what may happen.

It's fascinating to watch the U.S. slowly strangle itself with financial regulation. In a globalized world, international transfers should be made easier, not harder. And certainly not *impossible*, as with Chase and HSBC right now. If they keep this up, Bitcoin will explode.
Somewhere, I forget where, I heard someone speculate that the 30-minute rule may apply to American bitcoin exchanges, so that if you buy bitcoin the seller has to give you a 30-minute window to change his mind. This of course completely breaks the exchange systems based on order matching. Even worse, if it has to apply to bitcoin in general, bitcoin would essentially be outlawed because it is impossible to reverse transactions like this.

Sorry, I'm not going to explain this as if you were 5 - you're not, and if you were, there'd be no way to explain it to you.
Faster confirmation time makes each confirmation less secure. It also increases the orphan rate, thereby increasing the amount of wasted mining.
If you reduce the target to two minutes, you'll still have instances of 30 minutes between blocks.
10 minutes probably isn't a magic number, but it's been working fine for bitcoin. In periods of large speed increases we've seen five-minute intervals as well. This would be a big problem if the target was 5 minutes instead of 10 - you might see 10 seconds between blocks, with all the crazy orphaning that causes.

It is the cumulative depth chart. Moving your mouse over it will give you more information. The value axis for the cumulative depth chart is on the left, enumerated in [BTC]. 
About these bars going up and down (if there are any at the moment). They show market depth changes over the last 10 minutes. The value axis for them is on the right [BTC]. Bars on the left of the current price are bid offer changes, and on the right ask offer changes. So if somebody is adding a bid offer, you will see a green bar up on the left. About colors: if bids are added they are in green, and when removed they are in red. For asks it's the opposite. That's because when somebody is adding an ask, it makes it harder for the price to go up (red). If somebody is removing an ask it's easier for the price to go up (green).

I don't think anything has been proposed beyond "increase the block size". I don't agree about off-chain transactions defeating "the whole purpose", however. Whose purpose? A layer on top of Bitcoin of off-chain transaction processors who settle amongst themselves periodically on the blockchain following some standardized protocol can be quite fine for many things, and may even improve anonymity. Meanwhile, on-chain transactions will continue to be available for those who need them.

In my opinion, this is the holy grail of the Bitcoin project. The faster we can get away from this silly fiat exchange process, the better. It carries with it nothing but pain; we have to look at it simply as a necessary bootstrapping thing.
Bitcoin as a way to "carry" money over large distances by exchanging in and out of fiat is fine, but Bitcoin's real promise is as a closed economic system.

"Gatekeepers" in this context more usefully refers to people who have the power to decide that you as a person or as an organization should not be permitted to receive money.
Yes, miners decide what transactions get confirmed, but nobody can decide to block payments to NAFB (the much-reviled National Association of Furries and Bronies), because nobody knows which addresses belong to them. And thanks to Bitcoin, NAFB, although declared illegal, will be able to finance their website and their yearly convention (invitation-only, secret location, no cameras allowed). This makes them effectively unstoppable, and since they are able to continue to exist year after year, acceptance of FB (Furries/Bronies) gradually increases in society, allowing the next generation of FB youth to grow up with less shame and eventually be who they are. Thanks, Bitcoin.

If they did create it, it was for the exact same advantages that we always tout. The intelligence services need ways to transfer value to their secret foreign operatives, to pay off informants, to bribe foreign officials, and so on, clandestinely.
It's analogously to why they helped create (and still fund) Tor - their foreign operatives, diplomats, spies and so on, need ways to communicate without detection.
What these two have in common is that they couldn't have worked unless they were publicly available and every bit as useful to the common public as to the government that created them. A Tor network where the only users were a few hundred NSA agents would be pointless, and a cryptocurrency used only by a few hundred people would be worthless.
So this is one of those rare cases where the interests of government and the people coincide, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Many of their "stories" are simply plagiarized from other news sites or forum posts, copied verbatim and passed off as their own.

This was quite surprising to read. I expected this to be yet another proprietary service which would have me run software that promised to behave in my interest, and that I would simply have to trust this claim since you'd probably not even given any thought about open source, nor had any understanding of its importance. There are so many "privacy" services like that. I will not trust crypto-related software if the source is not available for me to inspect and build. This is truly make-or-break; if this is not in place, I won't even consider it, bitcoin or not.
So I'm very glad to hear that you're working towards this, and as long as the "or very close" part doesn't makes it untrustable to me, I'm looking forward to very seriously considering your service at that time. As long as you also take Bitcoin, of course :-)

Take euros as an analogy. If you want to send me one euro in the mail, then if you have exactly one euro-coin, it won't cost much. But if all you have is a hundred one-cent coins, the envelope will be quite heavy and you will have to pay much more in postage.
Of course due to the magical wonders of Bitcoin, what I receive is one whole one-euro coin - so the euro analogy breaks down at this point. So the "history" of your transaction doesn't affect me as the receiver, just you as the sender.

I agree that you definitely do have some degree of control, but ultimately, when you don't know what the private key is, it's not your money - now there's a third party that you trust. Your level of control over the money would be the exactly the same if off-chain was used.
I've since learned in this thread that you can indeed access the private key, which improves things - now both you and the tip bot know the key. It's not perfect because to remove the element of trust, you still have to transfer the money to another address.

That's right. An amount of bitcoin is represented by its number of satoshis - an integer, not a float. So bitcoin itself doesn't have a notion of "decimal places" at all. To "add a decimal place", you must basically say that while before 1 btc used to be represented as 100000000, now we need to add an extra zero at the end, so 1000000000. But there is no space for this in the protocol, so you need to change the whole protocol, and you need to be backwards compatible too (don't want old clients to interpret 1 btc as 10 btc!). And you need to get consensus from all the miners.
It can probably be done if it becomes absolutely a matter of life and death for bitcoin, but it would be an absolutely epic undertaking - and it only becomes harder and harder with time since there are more and more miners who have to consent.
If you thought the block size quarrels are tedious, you ain't seen nothing yet.

I can almost guarantee you that this was your mistake. One of the sites you use this password on leaked their emails and passwords. The attackers try to log into Mt. Gox with all of the leaked usernames/emails/passwords they can get their hands on, and this works every now and then because people use the same password on so many sites.
Two-factor authentication would have saved you in this case, but you really, really need to stop reusing passwords, especially on sites that actually hold your money. Forget about your virus scanner; security is not a program you install, but a set of practices that you learn and follow.

At some point, unless Bitcoin dies, the blockchain will take 100 terabytes to store in its full form. Some time later, it will take ten thousand yottabytes. We can hope that storage follows Moore's law, and we can hope that everyone has gigabit internet in the future.
Most people won't have to store this, but some people do.

The problem is two-fold as far as I can tell:
* People are unable to distinguish attacks on websites handling your bitcoins from attacks on the bitcoin protocol itself. (And to be fair, many of the attacks seem to have been genuine technical compromises due to poor programming or poor security policies at exchanges) To exacerbate this, if you have a poor understanding of cryptography (most people do), it's easy to think that the Bitcoin protocol cannot possibly be secure. People have been trained to think "anything can be hacked".
* Unlike conventional money, Bitcoin assumes personal responsibility. If you store them yourself, you need a reasonably secure computer and understand how a reasonably secure encryption password looks like. If others store them for you, you need to understand that there is no FDIC.
I think the latter point is often not emphasized enough for newbies. Assuming that someone will take personal responsibility is more radical than we think these days.

Bitcoin's value will continue to rise if Bitcoin continues to widen its adoption.

If some terrible design flaw was found in Bitcoin and it was impossible to fix, every single bitcoin could become worthless faster than you could blink.

How do you imagine any of this can happen without setting off a new American civil war? They would have to completely eliminate the Fifth Amendment for any of this to work, and even if they did, how would they prove you have any bitcoin? Just move your wallet.dat to a server overseas, problem solved. You couldn't do that with gold.
And even if you were right, there is a whole world out there that will use Bitcoin reguardless of U.S. laws, even if not a single American used it.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

If they have a point, they articulated it badly. Transactions have *always* taken "minutes" to confirm - specifically, ten minutes on average. This is not a sign of a lack of scalability.
Although, yes, Bitcoin *does* have scalability issues. I am quite convinced that we will end up with a network of off-chain transaction processors to more or less solve that at a small cost of decentralization. Call it "Ripple" if you will, or perhaps the Bitcoin community will design a protocol for this, like they designed the Payment Protocol we will get in Bitcoin-Qt 0.9. They are smart people; I don't worry.

He's right - outputs of previous transactions become inputs to new transactions.

It depends on what you agree upon. The most basic form is where you each bring a device (laptop, smartphone) with wallets on them, you give him the money and then he transfers the bitcoins. Here you have to hope that he doesn't run before doing so, and that he'll transfer the correct amount.
They also have an escrow service where the seller transfers the full amount into it before you meet. You give him the fiat, and he releases the funds. Now you know you get the right amount, and if he runs with your money, you can alert LocalBitcoins and they'll release the money to whichever one of you they believe is telling the right story.
And then there are sellers who doesn't require a meetup at all, but sell via bank transfer etc.

Bitcoin work by *consensus*. This means that there are rules built into the source code. Thousands of people run the software that distributes and verifies transactions. Verification means checking that the transactions and the other nodes follow the rules built into the software. You can change the source code that *you* run in order to grant yourself a billion bitcoins, but when you tell the rest of the network, they all laugh at you and you get nowhere. It's neat how it works - the more people use it, the harder cheating gets.
And yes, shutting down the whole internet is just about the only way to bring bitcoin down, at least from a technical perspective. There are other attacks such as introducing laws against bitcoin, but they would probably also be ineffective.
And to really understand the answer to your other questions, you have to read up on economic theory. That's what's so cool with bitcoin too - it's an excuse for geeks to teach ourselves some basic economy. So few people understand how "money" really works; I know I didn't, until bitcoin.

The bottom chart is the cumulative depth chart. Moving your mouse over it will give you more information. The value axis for the cumulative depth chart is on the left, enumerated in [BTC]. 
About these bars going up and down (if there are any at the moment). They show market depth changes over the last 10 minutes. The value axis for them is on the right [BTC]. Bars on the left of the current price are bid offer changes, and on the right ask offer changes. So if somebody is adding a bid offer, you will see a green bar up on the left. About colors: if bids are added they are in green, and when removed they are in red. For asks it's the opposite. That's because when somebody is adding an ask, it makes it harder for the price to go up (red). If somebody is removing an ask it's easier for the price to go up (green).

They can certainly observe the transactions you publish to the network, and so can any other well-connected node with pretty good certainty - if you look at a transaction on blockchain.info, you'll see a "Relayed by IP" field with an IP address. Since blockchain.info is very well connected to the Bitcoin P2P network, there's a fairly good chance that it's the IP of the user who actually signed the transaction.
All of this can be avoided by using Tor or a VPN.

If it's true, then Bitcoin has a fatal design flaw. If Bitcoin has a fatal design flaw, then Bitcoin is worthless, and once the market realizes, the price will go to $0.
So it seems to me like you have two options:
1. The hack works, so Bitcoin is worthless, so you don't have to use the hack
2. The hack does not work, so it's a scam, so you should not use the hack
In other words: you can make a decision without knowing if it's a scam.

2) Run local wallet software (Bitcoin-Qt if you can spare the disk space, a lightweight client if not, both are fine as far as trust)
3) Encrypt the wallet with a strong password. Use the wallet software's encryption support.
4) Back the wallet up to multiple secure locations regularly.

I'm sorry, this is not convincing at all. I'm not some sort of stickler for rules, but I know what kind of behavior tend to foster an interesting and productive online community, and I think rediquette sums up most of it.
In fact, I often have questions that need answering. I spend some time researching online and often find the answer, but if I don't, I know a bit more about it so I can formulate a good question where I explain what I want to do, what I have tried so far, what goes wrong and what kind of theories I have. Good questions get me good answers and I generally find people are helpful and patient.
Here on reddit, I upvote posts like these.
But posts like these are not what we're talking about here. The posts I downvote are directly lazy, completely unresearched, displaying a flaming degree of ignorance and an expectation of a full personal tutorial covering the most basic stuff. Not only is this not contributing at all, it is actively harming the community through the attrition of talented and experienced posters and causing them to leave.
If you want to see a frontpage chock full of "ELI5 bit coin", that's your prerogative, and I fully believe that you *should* upvote those posts if you really do hold the rather absurd belief that they contribute to a healthy and productive community. If that's what our members want this subreddit to turn into, they will vote with you. So far, this post has a negative 3 score strongly indicating the majority is not with you. But I don't hold your vote against you, and neither should you hold mine against me.

Mastercoin actually lost me from day 1, when Willet released the *amazingly presumptuous* "Second Bitcoin whitepaper". Arrogance so thick you can stir it with a stick.
And then this strange thing about this being *so* important to him, but he wanted LOTS of money to work on it, and then only 8 hours a day because he wants to spend LOTS of time with his family, and work full weekends volunteering for his church. But Mastercoin is like totally important to him.
And to seal the deal, their completely arrogant attitude when it became clear that they would basically use the UTXO for permanent storage of everything. Poor Mike Hearn was essentially down on his knees begging them, "please, please, do NOT do this, you will kill Bitcoin". And their response amounted to "hah, try and stop us". Arrogance so thick you need an industrial-grade mechanical saw to make a mark. (Yes, Johnston, I know this was eventually fixed, but the arrogant initial response to honest pleadings from bitcoin devs left a taste in my mouth that still burns.)
No, I don't like Mastercoin, and anyone who's been paying attention has every reason not to.

It's in the Mastercoin forum thread somewhere but it would take me far too long to find it (and it might even have been gmaxwell; it's been a while).
The UTXO space is where bitcoin nodes store the set of unspent outputs. This data structure needs to be fast because of how essential it is for Bitcoin to function. Space in the UTXO is very limited because of this - it's fine for Bitcoin's needs, but because Mastercoin abused it by storing its data there in fake unspent transactions, it would essentially grow enormously if this form of Mastercoin ever became popular.
To protect against this highly damaging, anti-social behavior, Gavin has implemented support for flagging fake outputs so they can be excluded from UTXO, and Mastercoin is using this feature now, so it can't do as much damage to Bitcoin. (Note this flagging feature has not been released yet, so we're lucky that Mastercoin isn't going anywhere)

No, I don't plan to work for free as your social media consultant. You're here to promote your site, using whatever means you think will help. The result is annoying spam.

It's easy to get that impression, because simply copy-pastes entire articles from other sources into his site and passes them off as his own. Then he posts them to and gets lots of upvotes, thus making sweet ad money. If you walk into the trap he laid for you and actually send email to the address he gave to you, you should expect him to sell your address to other spammers.

No, spending them is a form of "cashing out" (but instead of getting cash, you get a car). In that case, it works the same as bartering, which has to be reported for taxation.

If you're going to spend money anyway, they are better spent on bitcoins than on mining equipment at this point. Regarding timing, keep in mind that the price has almost *doubled* in just a month. Now it has plateaued and there seems to be quite some downwards pressure right now.
So if you want to make a quick buck, I strongly suspect that now is a bad time to go all-in.
But if you have a long enough perspective and a reason to believe in Bitcoin's future, then timing is not all that important. [Dollar-cost averaging]( where you buy little by little over time is typically a good idea.
@_date: 2013-07-21 16:34:19
They can't see what you use it *for*. So you're anonymous in that sense. But more importantly, the sites you visit can't tell where you're connecting from, which is what we usually refer to when we talk about Tor's anonymity.
@_date: 2013-08-27 17:03:47
Then who stole Bitfloor's coins? Theft happens regularly due to people reusing passwords and having poor security - but have *any* of those thieves been caught? No?
It's good that the media finally catches up with the inaccuracies of their own "bitcoin is an anonymous currency" meme, but they should also understand that with proper precautions, Bitcoin can be *effectively* anonymous.

It's silly to assume malice. They shouldn't have promised it and started putting resources into it given that they have so many larger challenges that need solving, but that doesn't mean that they *lied*; they were just overwhelmed by other problems after making the promise.

Why make all those concrete assumptions and then just jump to a made-up conclusion? Do the math for real!
Here's a lazy start:
After a million years, assuming the human population is a constant 7 billion, 220752000000000000000000000 keys would have been generated under your assumptions. 2^160 is 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976, but I'm not sure all of those would be valid bitcoin addresses. I don't know anything about the probability of being hit by a meteorite.
@_date: 2013-07-27 12:06:13
It'll take you forever to earn enough bitcoin for it to even be transferable out of the pool, and forever^2 for it to be worth enough for it to make sense to convert to fiat (which you can do on exchanges like mtgox.com or face-to-face at localbitcoins.com, or hundreds of other places). Bitcoin mining is not a money printing machine anymore.
@_date: 2013-08-24 22:33:00
What is it for?
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:09:27
But there *is* no "standard accepted value", there is only supply and demand, and a price results where those two meet. You're not willing to pay the price requested for the product you desire (anonymous bitcoins), and sellers are not willing to lower the price to meet your requested price, and so there is no trade between you. That is one perfectly valid outcome of the free market. It does not at all mean that "buying BTC anonymously is officially not possible in Canada".

Sell your computer for cash and use the cash to buy bitcoins. Forget about mining.

They didn't switch, they added an option to enable people to switch, if they want to. And I'm not even sure it's a new thing. The default is still full bitcoins.

If bitcoin takes off in such a way that it runs an entire economy the size of the U.S.', I certainly think increasing resolution will be a heavily discussed topic. I just think that situation won't be reached in many years, and at that point the mining community will be too diverse to come to any sort of consensus on such a fundamental change. The recent glitch could be resolved because the major mining pools could be contacted and were responsive. This might not be so easy in 10 or 20 years.
It's more realistic in my eyes that bitcoin would move more in the direction of becoming a backing asset for a whole other cryptocurrency or transaction mechanism.
So I'm not saying bitcoin could not handle a situation where satoshis are too valuable; I think it can. I'm saying the solution will not necessarily be a complicated hardfork.

It's extremely hard to make any sort of profit from mining. There's a huge upfront investment and the difficulty is literally increasing exponentially so the already miniscule returns will dwindle away over time.

This is exactly what I hope and think will happen in the long run - an open, standardized, off-blockchain settlement protocol that anyone can participate in. At the cost of some trust and some centralization, this could allow Bitcoin to scale almost infinitely.

"Backed up", ok, but currency backing means something else: it means whatever it is backed by, you can go to an authority and exchange a unit of currency by it. Gold is of course the typical example. But you can't go anywhere and get 25 grams of willingness in exchange for a bitcoin. It's "backed up" by willingness, but it's not *backed* by anything.

Bitcoin and cash really are comparable in this case. If you pay cash to someone and discover it was the wrong receiver, you simply ask him to give you the money back. Same with Bitcoin.
