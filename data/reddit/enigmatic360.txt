I'm almost certain I have (more like had, there is no way I can recover it) 10 to 20 BTC attached to a LocalBitcoins account I had around 2012. After that period of time BTC basically was wiped from my vocabulary until late 2016. Ah well, lol

It will come...

It's true, Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. It will become a global reserve currency as the big bucks boys continue to vacuum up the supply and HODL. Bitcoin may even see widespread use on a consumer level. It will become the defacto method to secure 'money' from predatory authorities or your enemies. But nothing will change.

How about a BCH version. This is a joke. Very nice work. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:00:37
I think very few wealthy individuals bother with such frivolous things until it can be more or less an accounting error. That is unless they truly got lucky and don't have the proper constitution to begin with \(bought and held Bitcoin at $200 with no real thought or foresight, trust fund baby, etc\).
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:54:52
Just foolish speculation for fun... If say the US and China agreed BTC needs to die; China could shutdown or hijack the major mining operations, easily, for at least long enough for a coordinated state effort to carry out a 51&amp; attack. Wouldn't destroy BTC, but the damage would be tremendous. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 05:46:04
Certainly not, particularly if you consider yourself a prospective investor (like I'm sure many of us do). I've read a fair bit of or about said people. Their philosophies are counter-intuitive to the very nature of Bitcoin, so it's not a surprise someone like Buffet so readily rejects it. That being said, I think a few projects would fit their perspective. Bitcoin is not one of them.

This basically sums it up. Some very basic TA does apply to Bitcoin, it seems \(like the 50d EMA\), but aside from that I've decided it's all bullshit, pandering, and coping.

The problem is shitty customers. Like people who still have a Wells Fargo account.

I feel ya. While I certainly can afford a luxury vehicle if I'd like, I'm determined to drive my '03 Land Cruiser to the bitter end \(290k miles and counting\). I've driven in plenty of really nice new cars from Toyotas to Teslas but at the quintessence of it, it's just a tool for getting from point A to point B. As long as the AC and stereo works, who gives a fuck?

I get the feeling is LE. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:35:10
Yup, and that's why I'm here basically. As long as a community exists, Bitcoin exists, basically no matter what.

So how's Bitcoin Crap going to adapt? Or are we just going to get to play August 1st again in three months?

Core shills already control 85% of market cap. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:01:55
We can't predict what will happen, I doubt it will be BTC. But then again SegWit is a blatant attempt for control. Either way nobody can be prepared for what the 21st century will bring, it's absolutely uncharted territory. The printing press brought down the aristocracy and forced the survivors into the shadows. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:57:10
Agreed. I like Teslas but they are not classy cars. They have the same utilitarian vibe as every other mainstream 4\-door sedan.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:18:40
That's what I fear. It seems some entities are aware of this risk and fight against it, while others relish it.

If you're solely in it for the tech, you're in the wrong forum.

I don't think I'm wrong when I say most of us here aren't Walmart employees in rural South Dakota. We came to an informed decision. After a campaign of misinformation and fear-mongering we, fortunately, did not swallow the blue pill.

I've had no qualms with Gemini since I decided to stop using Coinbase a few months ago. Well, one but it's minor and UI related - nbd.

You sound poorly informed. Do some research. Come to a decision. I for one think long term we are better off without it.

Whoa. Just realized it's a Tesla. I assumed it was a mid 2010's Kia

I don't think it ever will but I do think BTC may replace gold as a store of value, for all but governments and the ultra wealthy (but I expect they too will have some). Either way the meme holds up. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:37:39
This. Nothing in life is free. What I don't like is the 'minimum balance' bit. Sure, if someone opens an account stashes $100 and forgets about it. But if they're using it regularly and don't have $300 at for long, it feels predatory. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:11:48

Downloaded; it looks and feels great! Well almost. I wish I could scale the window (or just maximize it). Although it's fine non the less on my 1080p screen, however on my 2560p screen it's quite tiny. But pretty much every chart breaks or doesn't properly scale to 4k in my experience. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:30:46

It's not an odd thought but Apple has directly effected the lives of billions of people, be it through iTunes, an iPod, or iPhone or one of the countless third-party offspring. I realize it's not comparable to BTC really but at the same time I think it's a relevant comparison. What I think the platform needs is an education/ marketing campaign targeted at just about everyone with internet access. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:31:04
I think that depends on your holdings. If you are holding BTC that you bought awhile ago and has grown exponentially since, sure, hold the fuck on to it. If you're converting most of your fiat income into BTC on a regular basis, then why not?

I think the second sentence is the most interesting. It's incredibly vague. "When paper money displaced gold". Does he mean fiat, as in abandoning the gold standard? Does he mean documents as a store of value hundreds of years ago? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:45:01
Somewhat relevant. [

Nice post. I wholeheartedly agree, almost. The machinations of the market are beautiful and doubtlessly reward effort. Yet, at the same time it is a zero sum game. Unless all you deal with are blue chips, you have to be a little crazy to go all in (as a living). But, I think that's part of the charm.

There is not reality in which Bitcoin "destroys the banks". Best case scenario - we stop playing with pretend money (fiat).

I can't think of a credit union that has pulled this stunt.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:29:48
In a world where banks are obsolete we would see wealth inequality 100x what we see today ("Debt: The First 5000 Years" is a good primer). Bitcoin is not fiat. Bitcoins value comes from the energy that runs the network. At it's quintessence all value is energy. Many factors aside, Bitcoin cannot drop below $4000 (approximately) long term. The network would have a negative value and rational actors would cease operation.

Don't like your suggestions (although logical). I'd agree though in the sense that "miner" isn't a great term. Particularly because I can't think of any instance where "mining" has a positive connotation in this day and age.

The Indian government is right to be afraid. After Modi's shenanigans and the utter lack of the use of banks by the general population the economy could rapidly adopt Bitcoin and others as the defacto currency. A dooms day scenario for the feds.
