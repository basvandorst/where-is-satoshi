Wife of a bitcoin miner here; I hated every minute of it in the first year. Our shitty a/c unit could not get under 85 degrees, and it was a Vegas summer in a crappy 1 bedroom apt. Our electric bill was in the $500 range, fun days. Totally fucking worth it though!

My opinion on the part I can speak to is there are going to be extremists and cult-like behavior in every community whether its another alt-coin, sports, religion, technology, whatever. Some people get very excited about Bitcoin once they understand the technology and that's okay with me as long as it isn't overwhelming to the next lay person just trying to get a basic understanding.

Me too, except I was at home on my couch. Lazy people need amusement too.
Edit: too vs to. damn it. :(

It's really simple for us, we buy in at $100 per week, rain or shine. We've been doing so for several years and it keeps us sane. I also only provide freelance work in exchange for Bitcoin, just building up our stash slow and steady. While we are huge Bitcoin advocates, we stick to our dollar cost averaging strategy, because like I previously stated, it keeps us sane and I am not psychic, or experienced enough to call the lows.

Don't worry guys, he's got a spreadsheet back at the office that'll clear this whole thing up.

I don't know, but I am going to do something about this right now.

Well that escalated quickly.

If my husband never sat me down and explained what bitcoin was I don't know that I would have found out by now. So I can see why a catchy dogecoin radio ad might peak someones' interest who never heard of bitcoin. With that said, a quick Google search on dogecoin produced several mentions of bitcoin in the first few results.

Yes please!!! No Vegas though, I need to get out of here for a while. :)

"New movie introduces the people behind Bitcoin" or... "The people behind Bitcoin." Or just keep it the same and put "white" in caps.

Darn homonyms, they get me more than I'd like to admit! :D

Well done guys, I thought it was a very nice interview.

Not every coin is meant to compete with or serve the same purpose as bitcoin.

Congrats!! You might want to consider the benefits of cold storage.
