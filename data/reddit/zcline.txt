It looks like the website is using the Coinbase API.  So, you may want to rethink your response.

If you're so worried about being scammed, why such a large sum of money?  It would do you a lot of good to buy a small amount first and discover for yourself how to properly manage it. 
Whoever said Coinbase was a scam has no idea what they're talking about. Use the Coinbase for what it is, an exchange. You wouldn't go to a money exchange at the airport, take out 6k and them ask them to kindly hold it for you, would you?  Just because the feature exists at an exchange does not mean it's a good idea to use all features. 
Buy bitcoins from Coinbase and transfer to a paper wallet.  When you want to exchange for fiat, the opposite it true.

Do you have text forwarding setup on your Google Voice account?  It's disabled by default and now I see a good reason why.

Is it offensive to say that this solution looks like crap?

I'd hate to be the bearer of bad news but difficulty will most likely increase at a &gt;15% for the next year or more (this next difficulty and perhaps the one after an exception).  Why?  Manufacturers that know what they're doing are planning to skip 20nm ASICs all together and have been putting R&amp;D into 16nm chips.  Collaboration between major firms have already started on this venture and next year could be as big as this year in regards to ASIC technology.  
For home miners it's going to be a tough road ahead for the foreseeable future.

If you contributed more to Reddit than posting about this amazing book, people wouldn't instantly assume you are the ~~scammer~~ author.  
My answer is no, I will not read this book.  :)

Thanks Hypnotic for the post. I agree with your numbers but I would also take into account those who plan to sell their miners before the difficulty is too high.  I don't think anyone is planning to run their miners once power costs more than mining, which is well before 3 years!
I don't agree with comments that it will turn a profit if the price of Bitcoin goes up.  Yes it will extend the life of your miner before power=output but in this case you would have been better off buying from an exchange. 
 If you truly want to determine if a miner is worth purchasing, you should do all your calculations in bitcoin.  I purchased S3's because I plan to make 80% of my investment back in bitcoin with the plan to sell the hardware to cover additional cost and make a profit. I've already purchased 20% of my investment in bitcoin in order to cover myself if bitcoin prices go to the moon.  I've done very well so far using this plan with my S1's (&gt;30% profits) and I plan to do the same with this preorder.  I will follow up you guys on my efforts if it's worth it to anyone here. 
To all, definitely use BitcoinWisdom to pre plan your strategy and don't kid yourself that there's a magical faucet of money out there!
