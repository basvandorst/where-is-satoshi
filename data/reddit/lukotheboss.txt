I had some problems with Circle when I first made the account. They took about a week to verify my bank account, so I emailed them and received a reply within 12 hours. They verified my account, so I bought $5 worth of Bitcoin as a test. The process was immediate, and I sent the Bitcoin to my personal wallet. This entire buying and sending process took a whole of 2 minutes. It is safe to say that I am never going back to Coinbase again. Circle has my business forever now.

It seems to be rising right now. Generally the price rises when people buy more, and drops when people sell more. When more people are buying Bitcoin that is when the price will rise the most.

I called this guy out on this last night but didn't post it here. 
I sent Bitcoin to my friend so he could have some, and he asked me for some and I was originally going to give him some. Then I check his profile and looked at what a fucking dingleberry he was being and called him out for it.

As do I, my dad's family pays ~$400 a month with them, and they refuse to activate LTE on my Nexus 5. I tried convincing them to to switch to T-Mobile and everything was all set up but my step mom bitched about it and it never happened.
Sorry for trying to save you money, bitch. 
I'm switching to my T-Mobile plan this weekend (I pay for my girlfriend, mom and sister). Hello unlimited data!! I see 30GB a month in the near future.

Okay? Fuck that, seriously. I don't care if "to the moon" started with dogecoin, it signifies community and positive outlook.

Homie has a Bob Marley poster and what looked like a lighter and ashtray. I like him.

Thanks! He thinks he is going to go with BitPay as the processing company, how do you like them compared to Coinbase?

It is reduced to around 2G speeds, so usable for email and some light web browsing. Streaming video would be painful, but its better than paying for $10 more for 1Gb with AT&amp;T.

Seriously. 
I'm, like, super smart man.

If you would check the rest of that thread it shows I didn't tip him and called him out on his bullshit.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:46:08
I agree. Thank you for the tip!!
