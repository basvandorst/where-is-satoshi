Password in url? Who the fuck does that? It is literally the first thing you learn in a beginner web development class.

Ya think, DiNozzo?

Just some people trying to suppress bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:10:41
Blockchain is showing the right amount. I can see the amount I could import (I sent it to an other address). But that still leaves bitcoins left on the balance according to blockchain (and me) which I cant see in bitcoin qt.

Not just young people have a conservative mindset, many olds have it too.

Opened the console in the latest bitcoin qt. Typed importprivkey *key*.

Why would you go in the air when you can dig through the ground?
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:58:41
Yes, there are still some bitcoins on it.
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:16:52
That worked, thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:40:42
I bought bitcoins for around 100 euros when they were +800/btc and ofcourse I still have them.

The thing is that old people die. The old tech illiterate people will cease to exist. People become more educated. Compare the education of today vs the education of 50 years ago. It is a HUGE difference. More education and knowledge means that more people will be able to understand (atleast the usefulness of) Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:08:28
Oh indeed something like that would be really cool too.
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:17:10
Oh comon, there are guides out there you can follow, if you do exactly what they do you have a secure paper wallet. Ofcourse, this requires a small effort..
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:01:59
But there will be more Bitcoins being mined with those machines than it was x weeks ago. In short term price should drop because supply increases more than normally?
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:35:13
Yes it is but it brought the message.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:21:57
I'm sure it is the correct Bitcoin address with the correct private key. They are here near each on the paper I printed. I'm confused.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:50:56
So the prices will drop?
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:04:59
At best you mitigate the electricity cost.
@_date: 2014-11-23 18:50:22
the point of Bitcoin is not to make you rich idiot
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:26:48
I traded something worth 100 euros for bitcoins at the rate of lets say 800 euro / 1 bitcoin. I traded directly with an other person.

Any site can be a scam. It has nothing to do with gambling or bitcoin specifically.

This subreddit is doing what reddit as a whole is doing: censoring.

Wait. Is that the company with the sync client? Bitsync or something? Should I change?
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:07:09
I agree with that. Its preaching to the choir.
@_date: 2015-02-23 03:10:19
I lost you after the ',' because you might be implying something.

Like you would have a bank ID, something that makes sure it is you?
