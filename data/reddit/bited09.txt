I wonder how the  Porn industry will take advantage of the block-chain, maybe by rewarding  you by the amount of porn you watch ? I'm sure a coin of such kind  already exists or  is  in the progress of being created as we speak. 
Edit: Nvm, there is an Ico for a ["FapCoin" ](

If you are moving to a new wallet, don't send money from exodus to your new wallet.
You can access your bitcoin without having to pay such a high fee.
To extract your private key's 
1. Go into developer mode : Hold Ctrl+Shift+D 
2. Assets-Bitcoin-Export private keys.
3. Your private key will be saved on your desktop in a excel file, make sure to keep it safe and securely delete it . 
4. Go to elect-rum or your choice of wallet and recover a wallet using your private key.
In your new wallet, you can adjust the fee's unlike Exodus.

I accepted ripple as a form payment so i can then exchange to BTC. I didn't know you had to maintain 20 xrp all the time, there goes $50 down the drain(forced hodl)

The size of the transaction is 1288 bytes since the btc is spread across multiple addresses.
