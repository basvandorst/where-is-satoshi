This is actually a way BFX can lower their liability. If the IOUs trade at a discount, they can buy them up to their face value and effectively decrease their outstanding liability.

I don't know enough about it to speak knowledgeably, but based on my experience with the BitPay hack and how their insurance provider acted... I wouldn't count on any insurance payouts. Nothing insurance companies hate more than paying out the actual coverage.

Criminal prosecution? You realize Bitfinex is a VICTIM of the hack. The criminal is the hacker. Karpeles was running a Ponzi scheme, he's the one who committed fraud. BFX was attacked and their security failed. The situations are nothing alike.

lol right? Always gotta keep us on our toes
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:08:15
So an example of how the insurance company tried to screw bitpay...
Their policy specifically mentioned Bitcoin as an insured asset (BitPay negotiated this in from the start when deciding on insurance company), but the insurance company tried to claim that because Bitcoins are digital, they can not be physically on the BitPay premise, and thus were not covered. Under that logic though, the insurance company is effectively saying they knowingly sold BitPay a bad policy because they were never able to insure the bitcoins to begin with even though they specifically wrote it into the policy and had been charging BitPay for the policy... basically they just didn't want to pay and would fight it however they could. In this case, I think there may be a lot more ambiguity because the insurance policy can say they cover BitGo, and BitGo was never compromised... yada yada

You're probably talking about over 1m AML/KYC accts (my guess). There's a ton of value in that alone. Also if BFX offered some riskier leveraged products like BItmex does they could generate a lot more in fees.

It matters because each account has uniquely allocated assets.. specific segregated accounts were raided and others were not. The old way exchanges managed wallets was to lump them all deposits together into just a few wallets... commingling everyone's funds. So BFX actually has the choice of localizing or socializing losses which each has their +/-

Customers won't get jack if they're not solvent and are forced into Bankruptcy.
Also I'm not just saying creditors would be speculating, I'm saying outside parties can come in and bid up IOU too for speculative value. Like how people bought up DAO tokens to speculate on ethereum hard fork even though they were not original DAO investors but this gave original DAO holders a market to liquidate into early if they needed the cash sooner than later.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:37:23
Not saying selective withdrawals at all, immediate withdrawals would be fine, but they issue IOUs for the shortfall. (since they don't have 100% of funds). The market would price these IOUs, maybe theyre not worth much, maybe market thinks theres a decent chance of repayment and the IOUs have significant value. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 01:39:55
It's a ponzi. They're paying old investors with new investors money and because they're promising returns that far out pace their ability to keep growing it won't last long. I think they're promising to "double" your money every 6 months or so.

I've heard unsubstantiated reports of 1m to 3m usd profit per month. That might be entirely wrong and should not be taken as fact, but if true would make this plan feasible. We need to see the financials to know. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:18:53
MtGox never actually tried the plan, if you remember Charlie Shrem leaked the document to TwoBit which is how we found out MtGox was bust. Difference here is that MtGox was a case of fraud, which kept them from ever being transparent with their customers and thus maintaining confidence.. where as BFX seems to be acting in good faith.

Correct that is just you. As someone who has been involved in multimillion dollar hack, law enforcement does not make public statements on the matter.

They have a profitable business, and likely hundreds of thousands of AML/KYC'd accounts.. there's value in the business. But like I said else where, BXC would allow the market to determine their value and people could speculate on both sides of the trade. Lot's of good companies have been hacked in this space, they were just lucky it wasn't at this scale..

That would be fine, as long as depositors were only trading btc that they were certain to own... unaffected accts for example. Any trading of lost btc however would be unduly influencing mkt and be tantamount to fraud so you need to be very clear what coin has been lost. Or you could just disable btc currency pairs until you're ready for btc withdrawals.

Wait, no.. I rechecked this... it is 4k, but now it's actually 5k btc. 1,057,572 shares * 9.72 SEK per share = 10,279,599.8 SEK / 8.35 SEK (conversion to usd) = 1,231,089.8 USD / $232 per btc = 5,306 btc
Am I missing something? I think you assumed volume is denominated in SEK not in shares which then have to be multiplied by their SEK value.

Rassah manages Bitcoin100, a group that gave 1k to any charity that accepts bitcoin. The 750 Bitcoin were given to him to give away. AFAIK he has absolutely no allegiance to Theymos and is an impartial observer. As someone who's had many interactions with Bitcoin 100, I can confirm that Rassah has been an amazing fiduciary of the funds and I have not seen any hint of wrong doing... he sacrifices a lot of time free of charge to help the organization and has done much for the community at large.

Just to quickly share why, when we acquired Bitcoin Magazine there were a couple thousand magazines (across 22 issues) sitting in storage. We put these up for sales for $9.99 on our site originally and over the past 18 months they've been regularly purchased. Now the more in demand issues are almost completely out- and once we're out, WE'RE OUT. We've sold 23 copies of this issue today so far, and don't have many left, so we raised the price to slow down the buying and maintain supply for as long as possible. These copies are meant for collectors.
As for casual readers, we have every copy of the magazine available as downloadable pdfs under a pay-what-you-want model.

Hi this is David Bailey, owner of BTC Media. We own Bitcoin Magazine, yBitcoin, Distributed, among others. I only just discovered this thread because a customer brought it to our attention or I would have responded sooner. 
The claims made in this post (in regards to our properties) are 100% false, and while many crypto "media" sites behave unethically I can say with absolute certainty no BTC Media property (nor CoinDesk for that matter) would ever except payment in exchange for editorial coverage... I own the company and I barely have any influence over what gets published. If you have specific knowledge of one of our writers offering to sell their services (which I very much doubt), we would terminate their employment contract immediately. Please feel free to PM me any actual evidence... otherwise please stop baselessly smearing our company and insulting our team.

We published the Bitcoin Bowl special edition in early Nov, before Paycoin's launch. There were a couple red flags that concerned me but GAW explained them away perfectly... before we okay'd them for the cover we talked to a well known investor who had seen a "copy" of their financials and said they checked out. We confirmed they had a physical location and legal business entity. We checked in with Stewart Frazer, their banking backer from Cantor Fitzgerald, and he confirmed their plans. We talked with a miner manufacturer who confirmed they'd sold them multiple petahash. We worked on their advertisements (which btw all their content in yBitcoin was clearly marked sponsored) with their 4-person marketing team... at the time they had over 60 full-time (and professional) employees. I met Garza in person in Las Vegas and he seemed genuine.
We tried, it wasn't good enough, so we learn from it and try again harder next time. Clearly, knowing what we know now, we wouldn't have put them on the cover. I'm an old-school Bitcoiner, the last thing I want is more scams giving Bitcoin a bad name. We recent busted and forced the shut down of the largest (at the time) ponzi Bitcoin Cloud Services even though they were actively seeking to advertise with us 
GAW scammed us like they scammed so many others, and that's the end of the story. If you'd like to talk to me about it more feel free to call our office.

So real talk. If you have free power, it is 100% a no brained to buy a mining rig... they're great money. Be sure to pay it forward to the person helping you out though, as they cause noise and heat that is annoying. I believe the S5+ is designed for people who don't care about power efficiency and S7 is more power conscience. I recommend researching both. Find out how much power you can pull from the outlet, some of these rigs need enough juice they require a commercial set up so you don't blow the circuit. Do more research, but 100% absolutely worth it, you'll most likely ROI  within 4-6 months.

If Bitcoin actually mined a block every 10 minutes, projected halving from genesis block would be late December 2016. Right now the projected date is July 2016. Almost 1 month for every year Bitcoin has been in existence. There are currently projected to be 48 weeks until the next halving (almost a year). I don't think it's completely absurd to think  it could be cut another 2 weeks (or more if the price climbed dramatically). Unlikely, but very much possible.
Edit* To your point, because the units wont be shipped all at once the date will be cut more. If they were shipped all at once and quadrupled the hashrate, it'd only need one difficulty adjustment to stabilize block times.
Don't be so quick to cast stones, it's not polite.
@_date: 2015-08-09 03:53:54
Wasn't the first time, won't be the last. We actually had Neobee on the second issue. We do our best vetting every company that advertises with any of our properties, but scams try very hard to convince you that they're not.

With free power, given you can actually have the miner delivered (it's not stolen in the mail, or the company goes bust before delivery, etc.. ), and you're not trying to overclock the machine, and you're not running an industrial farm that adds a bunch of additional variables, then yes... right now, buying a miner is ALMOST risk free ROI if you have free power. I don't understand how that is wrong... the only unknown variable is difficulty increase... the math above with the 8 month ROI would suggest the rate quadruples which is pretty unlikely in that timeframe. Even if it goes up 10x... you will still ROI given a long enough time horizon. 
That said, ROI in this scenario is measured by the amount of bitcoin it will return... i.e. $2000 invested into bitcoin today vs $2000 worth of bitcoin invested in mining.. which will generate more BTC. Impossible to say ROI in $ as that is speculation on price...
The only reason mining is known as high risk is because most people don't have free power, and power is a major cost. Creates a scenario where at some point it makes sense to turn the miner off as difficulty rises. With free power you should never shut the machine off. Also long history of less than trustworthy companies in mining space, but Bitmain has an amazing reputation for delivery and product... it's why they've become the  hardware manufacturer. Do research before you try giving people financial advice.

Difficulty only adjust every 2016 blocks... if the hashrate consistently rises at a rapid pace, each difficulty increase could see a half day or full day shaved off until halving (7-12% increase in hashrate every two weeks). It's happened before. Also see hashrate in 2013/2014 when it was truly exponential.

Like what? Have you looked at an ROI calculator lately???
Edit* So I did the math for you, at current rates an S5+ would break even in a little over 4 months. Assuming a 10% difficulty increase every two weeks (more than double what it currently is) would likely ROI within 8 months. Idk about you, but generally speaking a 100%+ ROI per year qualifies as pretty damn good return... especially for a box you just plug in.

Shame to see them go- if any writers/editors are interested in picking up some extra work contact tyler who runs editorial at Bitcoin Magazine. If you live close to the Nashville area you should definitely contact us, as we're actively hiring for BTC Media.

We own yBitcoin and BitcoinMagazine. yBitcoin fits a very specific use case which can only be achieved through a print medium and on a massive scale (we're 15x bigger than Bitcoin Magazine at it's peak)... we literally ship magazines in bulk by the tractor-trailer. I would also call yBitcoin more of a community tool than a traditional magazine since we ship them for free nationwide. The economics of the print Bitcoin Magazine, which followed the traditional subscriber/ad funded news/analysis model, were horrendous and made absolutely no sense... which is why we only publish content to BitcoinMagazine.com

The writer may have the story wrong, but this statement would mean they are buying Bitcoin...
"The source told IBTimes UK the bank has been doing "beta testing" involving crypotocurrency, and that the addition of bitcoin into one of the bank's currency funds would soon be announced in Paris."
The quote you referenced was added to the article later. It's either a canned PR response, or the writer misinterpreted the original source... but how it is stated now it still means they would be adding cryptocurrency exposure into one of their existing forex funds.
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:50:13
That's a total change from the original article, either meaning the writer got it wrong originally or BNP PR team blew up at him and forced him to change it.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:14:19
If this is true, will cause new bubble no doubt. This is big on multiple different levels. Our editorial team at BitcoinMagazine is working on confirmation- if this is an actual leak this guy just cost BNP a lot of money. 
Being in Bitcoin media for over 3 years now, and formerly coming from the finance world, I think this rates amongst the most important developments to ever happen to Bitcoin.
Edit* For a currency fund, at a bank like BNP, 50m or 100m usd worth of holdings would be considered "nothing"... to even be worth the energy of performing diligence we're talking at least high 8 figures worth of holdings. If the market wasn't so illiquid and small, I would assume at least 9 figures... which at todays market price equates to hundreds of thousands of coins. This will also cause a follow on effect of other firms adding it to their currency funds... really hard to understate how big this is (if true, which I'm still very skeptical of). Also will be very interesting to see how they implement: How are they sourcing coin? Will they custody funds themselves? If so what storage, auditing, insurance services will they be using? This is BNP, every little detail will have massive implications for our space.
Edit 2* Article has been completely changed from original language- the original article clearly meant "buying bitcoin for inclusion into a BNP forex fund". Changes now read as if they are only employing blockchain tech... like many other firms are also doing. Not even close to the same things. This either means author was wrong with original article, or BNP press team flipped out and pressured him to change it.

Major story happening there, ponzi scheme blew up that suckered in 70m usd in ltc... I'm having bitcoin magazine staff put together a piece on it now.. potentially not over yet. But dont let Qntra, which has a political agenda, create a fake narrative and then filter out the legit reason. ltc trade unwinds and speculators going back to btc is the cause of this. Period. Would we even be allowed to post the article here?

Yes, easily 3m+ unique readers over all Bitcoin Media sites (including etc..). Also, often times it's the MSM regurgitating our content... Reuters has repackaged two of our articles just this month. All depends on if your editorial team does original reporting (some do, most don't)

It's instant to transfer into bitcoin, so its as if you could use paypal to check out with any Bitcoin accepting Merchant. And you could hold Bitcoin in your paypal account.

I hate to burst your bubble, but this is patently ridiculous. Vanessa worked at Bitcoin Magazine, BTC Media bought Bitcoin Magazine, now she works for BTC Media. As this is an ongoing legal and criminal matter, I have not commented publicly, but these conspiratorial posts are just so over the top... Hope to be able to discuss publicly soon and shed some light on how sophisticated this attack was.

This is the holy-grail of digital currency, I'm amazed right now. Congrats to the whole Circle team! Assuming this works as stated, and theyre not losing a fortune in the process, I'd be surprised if someone doesn't try to buy them soon... it's effectively Venmo but better in ways Venmo can not replicate without utilizing Bitcoin rails.
If I'm a legacy competitor I'm thinking how well can this thing scale... and if it can, how quickly can I replicate it?
Additionally, with FDIC insurance, and a $3,000 weekly limit, I'm wondering why I wouldn't just start maxing out my Circle deposits and hold my balance as USD... I'd then effectively have a checking account with no fees I can move around instantly anywhere... if I want to buy something with Bitcoin it takes seconds to transfer my Circle USD to BTC and make the transaction.
It's been said before, but this is a game-changer IMO.

We print BitcoinMagazine and yBitcoin and run a fairly large print shop. Depending on a variety of factors we might be able to do this for you free of charge. Feel free to email me at david and we'll see what we can make work.

Sure, I can move USD instantly to anyone for free- this isn't moving money from bank account to bank account or they wouldn't be able to provide this service... effectively you're moving USDcoin. No other company provides this services except Venmo, but Venmo is susceptible to charge backs and thus does not allow its use for commercial transactions. Circle is now the custodian of my funds. My funds also are FDIC insured. I can then seamlessly transfer that USDcoin into Bitcoin... so just how bitcoin payment processors let you pay a usd equivalent price in bitcoin I can now pay a btc equivalent price in usdcoin... no volatility, instant/free transactions, seemless to move in and out of btc.

1. You make this claim, but you don't support it. More than $10 billion a year is invested into EMR and interoperability solutions (Cerner, EPIC, Emdeon, etc..) and they don't work because they're effectively the healthcare equivalent of apple pay/samsung pay/android pay/etc... walled gardens controlled by central administrators with out the proper incentive models... EMR/interop companies like PokitDok, Redox, C4MI, and the above are all attending the conference and are very actively experimenting with blockchain solutions.
2. This is like saying multisig in bitcoin is no good because there is counterparty risk and thus it's no better than a bank account.
3. How about a neutral, perpetually available, single source of shared truth not administered by any company that is completely permissionless for any other company (small or large) to leverage. You may say "so what" but talk to any HIT engineer and it blows their mind. I talked to a systems architect the other day who said it was "technically impossible to have a decentralized single source of truth"... he had never taken the time to understand bitcoin and had never heard the term blockchain.

Seems like this suggestion comes up every couple months... This is literally what yBitcoin is for. It's free, it has great content from great writers (Voorhees, Gallippi, Andreas, Tuur, Trace, Silbert, Perry, and so many more), the content is education focused, has professional editing/graphics/design and it looks and feels credible... it was built for the community and it's now been funded by over 100 bitcoin companies. We print and distribute over 40,000 copies every 3 months. The only downside is that because it's supported by advertisers, every once in a while we have a bad apple slip in- we do our best though!
You can get a free copy at yBitcoin.com - we even pay the shipping. (It also available as a downloadable PDF)

I believe BitPay has a minimum account amount ($20?) before the do a fiat deposit, otherwise they sweep it into your account every couple months (otherwise you could drain them by making them do a $1 transaction every day)

We publish content on Nasdaq because we have a publishing deal with them. It took over 4 months of contract negotiations to make it happen and major editorial investments on our part- so no, they don't let anyone publish on there.

Just want to clarify, though already stated many times elsewhere, that Bitcoin Magazine does not accept payment for editorial coverage.
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:27:15
We're working on creating some advertising standards with some other companies in the space that can be industry wide... it's very challenging doing due dilligence on advertisers. Generally if they are a real business, with a real phone number, and a real team, that checks most of the boxes. The industry needs better policies in place to filter out the scams without requiring media companies to audit companies (something we can't do).

Ahhh, should have put a caveat, we only pay shipping for North America. Overseas shipping is too expensive for us to do on scale (we tried for a while). For example, shipping a box of magazine to Australia costs us a couple hundred dollars. However, we generally have a lot of magazines at bitcoin conferences, so next time you attend one grab a whole stack.

Most of the investors were under serious NDA's so we couldnt get anyone on the record... deal was shrowded in secrecy. We also could not confirm what they were doing with the money. We have a mining expert whom we highly value his opinion and he was very skeptical of the deal size without us knowing what they were spending the money on... with a story this big we couldn't risk publishing a story without on the record statements and 21e6 would not respond to any of our requests for comment.

Editorial content written and/or published by BTC Media brands (such as Bitcoin Magazine) is managed by a completely independent organization and team than any of our client facing services. Aaron is an amazing journalist and very bright mind and we're proud to support his editorial work- but his personal opinions are his own and we in no way try to censor him.
BTC Studios, our creative agency, handles client-facing marketing services. Again, it is a completely separate team and it has absolutely zero role what-so-ever in any of BTC Media's editorial decisions. In fact, some of our BTC Studios clients over the years include: Bitmain, BTC.com, Bloq etc... as well as Bitfury, BTCC, and 200+ other industry firms. Blockstream unfortunately is not a client, but we'd welcome them anytime! 
We have mad respect for Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, and our only agenda at BTC is to see the proliferation of cryptocurrency globally. If you have editorial content that you would like to see published, please reach out to editor we're always looking for great writers!

Suggested authors to follow: Bill Gross, Ray Dalio, Jim Grant, Kyle Bass, Jim Rogers.
Thing about QE, is that the main damage is being done via the FFR. The search for yield means money is forced into higher risk investments which then results in significant malinvestment. This malinvestment takes an unlimited number of forms and is impossible to measure as the knock on effects can be several degrees of separation away and seem entirely unrelated on the surface.. That is until rates normalize and the market attempts to washout that malinvestment... Which then causes the gov to backstop, which creates a moral hazard, punishing good actors and rewarding bad actors, and the credit cycle repeats. Fed policy makes all the sense in the world if your goal is to maintain the economic status of entrenched interest.
This can be done in perpetuity until the ability to backstop (lender of last resort) is lost... Which can't be lost until we lose reserve status globally... Which can't be lost until Bitcoin takes over the world... Amirite?
