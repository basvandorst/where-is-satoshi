i'm not asking for "support". im asking if anyone else has had issues sending BTC to Binance.

i'd still be in the bushes watching with binoculars if i lost that much in the GOX shuffle.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:52:39
buy at every price. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:20:45
dont be surprised if it takes up to 10days for your money to show up. its pretty standard now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:59:44
i'm starting to feel like a correction is the price going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:05:36
rest in power.

Phoenix, AZ.
the tech boom over the last few years has been crazy. 
paypal, amazon, intel and dozens of indie development shops.

my fault... its .12%. smh
'The Vault costs an annual fee of 0.12% for each deposit you make.'
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:51:23
western union... LOL
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:14:53
correct, its 0.12%. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:30:54
im new to mining too. i got super confused and decided to buy 2GHS from cex.io and mine in a pool in the cloud instead of trying to set up my own miner. so far so good... 
has anyone else used cex.io? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:58:55
ok, so how does this work?
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:50:19
i have some friends in the UK that said they can't link their checking accounts so they had to get BTC elsewhere.

12% on every deposit. 
is it a 'bad' thing? no.
its just not the smartest option, in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:33:54
they want you to use their 'vault' to store your coins and charge you .10% to keep them 'safe'... 
i think i'll stick with my paper wallet. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:27:55
you just saved my bitcoins. thank you.
** logs in, sends to paper wallet **

i've had 0 issues with them. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:55:17

@_date: 2018-06-26 16:39:14

@_date: 2017-11-25 03:46:03
Bitcoin ATM’s or Coinbase because their accounts are all FDIC insured. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:28:03
i wasn't asking for anyone's "advice". the only question i asked was "is this drop correction?" so calm your tit's buddy. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:25:22
Bitcoin atm. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:18:26

"this one time bitcoin went all the way up to $7300..." LMAO!!!
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:38:42
HELL. YES. !!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:02:54
over 200 BTC? that's about $1,102,450. do you have 200BTC? unless you got them when you could get 5000 for $27 i highly doubt most people using BTC have 200.
