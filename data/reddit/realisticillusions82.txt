This is a straw man argument. The choices are not complete regulation, or complete de-regulation. The government’s role should be to regulate only to the extent required to protect individual rights. The rest should be free market

Again, not true due to failure to see gradients.
Let’s take your use of “democratic” for example; America is not a democracy, and was not intended to be. It is a representative Republic. There has never been a pure democracy in the recorded history of government (no, not in ancient Athens either). So how democratic are we? Pretty democratic, relatively speaking.
Similarly, we can have a generally “free market” with some regulation. Yes those regulations are determined by the government / judicial system, which was set up with checks and balances, and as a representation of the will of the people, albeit an imperfect one.
Is any human system perfect? That doesn’t mean we should allow obvious imperfections, deceit and/or outright fraud to take place in our systems.

Just happened to me today. Have been buying/selling for literally 2-3 years now. Went to buy the drip today - smaller transactions than almost any I’ve done actually - and Coinbase reported the buys were cancelled due to being rejected by my bank. Never happened before today.

No, you would pay for only the house you can afford, as would everybody else. Prices would not be driven up by the fact that everyone is taking out an 80 to 90 percent loan, which would reduce the frothiness and bubble tendencies of the market.

Lol. A somewhat appropriate bias given the subject matter. I feel like it drives BTC’s price entirely right now

Yours. Hopefully.

Lol. Did I say it is going down for sure? 
You speak as if certain that anyone who doesn’t invest will “miss out on profits” and yet deride me as the one claiming to know something for certain.
A bubble revealing itself as such when everyone and their dog is talking about it is a well-known phenomenon. That’s all I’m saying.

What we all know, which is that it’s essentially insolvent, almost completely collapsed in 2008, and is currently propped up by the Fed printing untold trillions of dollars, injecting the liquidity that is currently blowing up numerous bubbles, primarily the stock market, among others.

Then you haven’t been reading enough. Maybe it’s outside of Reddit, as Redditors tend to be far more informed and discerning. But the uninformed internet is collectively saying it is not too late to get in and it’s going up 10x, 100x, whatever, from here.

For reals, first time I am hearing about this.

I agree there will always be inefficient allocation of resources, but saying that we should therefore exacerbate this with the likes of the Fed is akin to saying that we should not seek to improve CO2 emissions because “some pollution is inevitable” - or whatever, you get the point. 
The Fed is a cancer and I believe history will see it as such when all is revealed, but I can’t prove it so I’ll leave it alone. Read “the creature from Jekyll island” I believe it’s called if you are interested in the subject.
In terms of Musk, yes I am a huge fan after reading the recent biography on him. I agree his companies are heavily subsidized, but he has also accomplished incredible things like the first reusable rocket into space, which NASA couldn’t accomplish with untold taxpayer funding.
In addition, my understanding is that the Oil industry is heavily subsidized in various ways, even now as one of the wealthiest and profitable industries in the world.
Musk has single-handedly changed the auto industry by making electric cars “sexy” - you’ve probably heard that various major automakers have announced intentions to convert their entire fleets to electric vehicles by 2020 or so.
Now Tesla’s recently released electric Semi trucks are receiving large orders from trucking companies.
Not to mention his pet projects. I think one can objectively say he is one of the most important entrepreneurs of this century without overly gushing.

What’s your end game, say bitcoin hits $100k?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:09:29
This entire comment thread is what is so scary about Bitcoin right now. People just throwing out gigantic numbers with no real analysis or understanding, swallowing the belief hook, line and sinker about Bitcoin being a store of value and going up forever.

I am not specifically against an elastic money supply. I am against the formation of an institution (the Fed) which exists outside the purview and control of the people and even the government, unilaterally controls the supply of money, and manipulates interest rates and money supply in an attempt to control boom and bust cycles, rather than allowing the free market to determine asset values and redistribute money in the most efficient way.
I am not familiar with the panic of 1907, so will not comment there.

And by the way, the sub-headline on this post says “hodl to the moon.”
So yeah it’s on Reddit too.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:58:54
So dumb

Apparently this was temporary. Received a notice from Coinbase and was able to get new transactions to go through.
