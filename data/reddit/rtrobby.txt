Not if I link it to my Reddit account. It was not a small amount of money, and I'm not going to give total values. Sorry.

Bitcoin's mining is far more decentralized than many other coins, such as Bitcoin cash. BTC has 16 major mining pools, BCH has 6...
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:56:39
The problem is newbies will fall for the shilling. It's fine to promote BCash, but it is NOT Bitcoin. You cannot just have a different opinion on something that's fact and it be ok.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:53:11
Oh no... You've fallen for the BCash propaganda... I'm so sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:30:53
And no, I'm not doxxing myself, thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:51:12
You're just a shit disturber. Why would they hire a Director of Engineering that doesn't know anything about engineering?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:03:34
Why does everyone talk about the whitepaper as if it's a religious text? It doesn't need to be just like the whitepaper to be successful in its goals. BCash is centralized, which goes against Satoshi's intentions. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. BCash is BCash. Do not spread false information.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:48:34
No he's right, I actually made Ethereum and handed it over to Buterin. Just like I made Bitcoin and handed it over to Satoshi. I said it on Reddit so it must be true.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:47:15
Got my tx confirmed first block with a 0.06 fee. Why would anyone in their right mind pay 65 cents?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:02:05
Made no comment on that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:39:08
Well, if the guy who wrote the whitepaper believes this, then maybe the BCashers will finally shut the fuck up about staying true to the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:11:33
I'll give you that one, that was pretty funny
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:25:52
Thank you for teaching me how median vs. average differ. Nevertheless, I personally transferred roughly the same amount of USD value in LTC and BCH at the same time, and paid 6c and 8c respectively. Do not tell me what is cheaper when I have used them myself.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:50:02
You do realize that Litecoin is cheaper to use right now than BTC, BCH, ETH, or any ERC20 token, correct?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:20:12
Same website, average tx fee. Which is less than half of BCash*.
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:47:29
Backwards to you, right to another. Your thinking is backwards to them. The cycle never ends.
The last year has made me hate partisanship more than anything. I hate getting into it about politics with anyone anymore because no one has an open mind, left or right. I put all my time and energy in Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain now.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:17:01
We'll both can be used, and not everyone is using Segwit. Not a fork.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:30:27
They were all hilarious. But, ETH is still up 40% since 1 month ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:38:38
He's still developing it. Come on please don't tell me you're this gullible from the Litecoin FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:28:24
Litecoin is not full either. GDAX to wallet transfers. Nothing I can do. That was the market/network fee at the time. What point are you trying to make?
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:54:41
That's not quite true. The more likely scenario is batched transactions (BitGo confirmed they did this today on the biggest block) and greater SegWit adoption. Try again.
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:32:19
Use Litecoin or BTC Segwit or hell, even lightning network if you're daring.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:03:00
It's obvious you're trolling and/or just don't know the industry, and I don't know which it is.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:10:21
I'm not worried about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and that's that. Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, and not a single shitcoin alt that forks off will ever take over. I personally believe in Litecoin above all else. You know, the crypto that is 4x faster than BCash, has 156% of its daily volume, and with fees 50% cheaper? Oh yeah, that coin. The original Bitcoin fork
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:21:35
Nothing wrong with taking advantage of cash back you get on credit cards. I buy most of mine with credit and just pay it in full soon after so I can get money back.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:57:21
You do realize that uses the automated clearing House, right? You know, the centralized settlement machine that takes 3-5 days to clear? Oh yeah...
Meanwhile, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, every other crypto begins processing nearly instantly (as soon as a node picks it up) and theoretically clears in the block time? Even Bitcoin clears within an hour...
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:51:27
I thought I heard stuff about Wells closing accounts, but I'm not entirely sure. I do know it has happened at both Chase and Citi. Bank of America is the only one of the big 4 in the US that I haven't heard about it from, yet their brokerage firm Merrill Lynch banned investments in crypto related products.
Do research, make informed decisions everyone.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:27:35
I've also been in the same boat for awhile.  Focus more time and energy on pushing for education and adoption of the tech, rather than the current prices.  Value will come in time if the former are true.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:34:07
Buying low amounts yield the same fees as bank buy.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:51:37
Did you read anything of why he sold?
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:07:42
That just means physical transactions on the blockchain have decreased. It in no way means fewer people are using Bitcoin. I don't know how one could come to that conclusion.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:39:00
Coinbase will never be Gox. 98% of assets are in cold storage, therefore impossible to be stolen.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:44:36
Coinbase has stated it, and they would not be able to be properly licensed in the United States if they lied about it. Understandable to be wary of claims from exchanges, but come on. They're doing nothing that Gox did.
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:39:25
It's absolutely both sides man, come on. You basically repeated exactly what Trump said. Don't be so partisan.
Bitcoin is a very libertarian technology. We should all embrace that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:48:57
There is far more reason to invest now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:19:48
Stop posting this. All it does is scare people more from spending BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:54:17
Not once it begins, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:47:14
If only it were actually worth 1 BTC, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:50:19
You don't. You have no access until that date.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:42:51
Read your comment wrong before, sorry. No there is not. You can store on coinbase for easy viewing, sell/buy on gdax to save money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:43:27
Buying with a bank account takes up to 10 days to deposit, but locks in price, and allows higher limits. Credit and debit transactions are instant, but have higher fees and lower limits. Hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:35:43
Please don't hurt my friend Litecoin. I love him too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:52:02
Use Coinbase. It's an American company.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:50:39
It likely is a bubble, however it doesn't mean it's a bad thing, and it may never pop either. Even if it did, it would go right back up to where it was relatively quickly. Everything is a bubble. Bitcoin and crypto are the future.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:05:44
Technically, adoption is directly linked to price since they are scarce. Higher price means more folks using it.
However some people do only care about the price because they are making money, and that is a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:47:45
You could do it, but that wouldn't make it legal.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:45:22
It could just scare people who read into it too much, and those with weak hands will sell.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:55:53
How does that prove he knew? He just made a prediction, turned out he was right. Stop grabbing at nothing. There is PLENTY you can skewer Ver and Bcash for.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:50:57
It's Szabo.
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:20:33
Wrong number and wrong commas...

Lol this isn't a porn sub, you don't need to include your age and sex you weirdo.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:07:43
For me, it's 4th.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:02:13
Coinbase, as it's insured and only 2% of all currency is stored online.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:42:51
If you use a wallet that doesn't support their addresses, you cannot pay the invoices.
@_date: 2018-11-18 00:17:34
He's a pedophile and a general creep anyway. Who cares.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:51:15
BofA has yet to block any of my crypto buys on debit or bank transfer.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:54:52
I haven't switched my node over yet because I've been busy. I will do so on the weekend.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:11:01
I just think it's stupid that I sent a $11 BTC tx and they paid that much to get it confirmed...
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:49:50
Their stupid BIP 70 addresses which don't allow anyone to pay them (like Jaxx users, for example) and their BCH/BTC network fee thing to discourage users from using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:09:45
Knowing what the current fees are for Bitcoin, I can only infer that it is indeed political bias.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:30:56
At least you can still use their wallet. Bitpay is doing everything they can to make it harder to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:55:04
A step no one should have to do.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:57:05
As much as I agree that it's dumb for anyone to buy Tai's course, he's still a smart man. He's working with some big names in crypto, like Brock Pierce, and seems from his free stuff to know quite a bit.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:57:01
GDAX is still paying crazy fees for themselves. My tx earlier was paid by GDAX at 316 sat/byte. $7.24 fee for a small tx...
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:13:55
That's the same question you can ask about anyone trying to force Bitcoin Cash. It really doesn't make sense, but they all do it anyway. Remember that Bitpay  was all for Segwit2X.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:21:21
I'll just let the free market run its course and watch what happens.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:32:29
As much as I love H3H3, he got it wrong. Zillow lists every piece of property in the nation... Tai owns his house and leases/owns all of his cars.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:40:40
This is dumb. Don't stoop to their level. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. One is the real Bitcoin (BTC), the other is some centralized altcoin that works similar to bitcoin on the main chain (BCH).
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:59:46
They're defending Bitcoin from the idiots who say there's no intrinsic value, but fiat is all good. I don't know why anyone is getting triggered by this.
