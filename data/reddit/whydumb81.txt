Cool thanks a lot!
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:26:14
So are you saying that the price of a Btc will split when the halving starts?
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:35:29
Because i hVe spent a few months there and it is the most awesome place on earth. It is beautiful, cheap, the girls are hot and the food is amazing.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:19:20
Ya it is super concentrated weed. High THC content. You can use different strain for CBD. But CBD does not get you high. I only is used for medicinal purposes.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:14:49
I am pretty sure i remember that comment. Haha
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:13:18
Manufacturing. I was making hash oil. It is the same charge as manufacturing meth. Crazy shit. And i had a gun in the house. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:59:35
I am gonna buy some ethereum maybe a hundred or two worth and try to ride it out but I do think the tech is gonna blow I just don't know where!
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:26:26
I am so glad that we have human auto correctors still, I thought robots completely took over that occupation!
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:32:10
No more tobacco in prison because it became a currency! WTF
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:54:40
I have that taken care of. I put aside 7k for that and my fines!
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:34:31
Thats insane! And thats why I am so stuck!
@_date: 2016-02-29 07:24:53
Where do you Buy gold at market value or less at?
@_date: 2016-02-29 10:37:29
If any of my friends were sick especially my wife I would drop the BTC in a heartbeat!
@_date: 2016-02-29 08:01:46
Does the halving mean it is worth double or how will that work?
@_date: 2016-02-29 12:47:12
You are right and I am trying to do whats best in the long run for us. It is just such a hard decision.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:16:47
Cool thanks I am checking it out now!
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:49:10
Ya i knew she was too in the back of my head but when your going through something like that you choose not to believe whats true. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:34:03
I ended up watching the whole 40 minute talk and it was pretty good thankd for the link.
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:56:30
Haha I know I haven't even thought about that but I know I am gonna be Bugging my girl about it!
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:23:21
Nope! But I am guessing he is in a similar situation? lol
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:11:56
Hell no! That bitch emptied all my bank accounts, sold all my shit, sold my BMW and slept with my ex best friend with in 2 months. So no i think i am moving to Indonesia for a while omce i am off probation.
@_date: 2016-02-29 11:11:33
Are you kidding me I got in trouble for hash and I there was a gun that wasn't mine in the car. But seeing how you know the circumstances I will just let you judge me.
@_date: 2016-02-29 07:29:30
I like the best case scenerio ! But my wife thinks it is stupid monopoly money and would never let me forget it that she was right! I would love to prove her wrong and be a boss when I get out though! How could I make it rain on her with bitcoins though?? Stun gun?
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:40:24
Thanks bro. But i dont always have a great attitude. I just know that there is no point in wastimg energy on something i cant control.
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:22:39
Ya I guess your right, but I am gonna be so pissed at myself for not getting more coins if it goes to a $1000+ for not investing more. I don't see how it could collapse. Isn't there more stability now that it has grown so fast and more heavy hitters are onboard? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:13:51
Yes. I will have no problem working when I get out!
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:18:57
Ya I just seen that they have brain wallet crackers now? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:17:49
I have no control over that and I can only hope for the best! I do trust her and I know she loves me. But I can't control how she will deal with this. I do think she is strong and will push through it but I wouldn't blame her if she went rouge. It is a hard thing to think about and it feels like your waiting for your death sentence but I am tough and only time can pass. I guess I will wait and see.
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:29:49
That is actually the best advice on here. Thank you I am going to do exactly that.
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:23:55
That makes sense. I am probably gonna sell the BMW even though its  like giving up a child.
@_date: 2016-02-29 07:22:18
 I will try and remember this reddit post when I get out!
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:50:16
How could it go to zero though? Isn't there too much of it circulating for it to come out completely worthless? 
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:46:32
I have a few K to get me through till I get out and plus I still got 2 pretty nice cars I could probably sell if need be. Other than that I just got the 5K and 13.6 Btc. I do not really trust the banks although I do have a bank account. I am planning on leaving the country after I get this being me. I ordered a ledger cold wallet last night hoping that it will last 3 years in a safety deposit box. I could leave it with my wife but that would probably get spent pretty fast or cause alot of problems. lol! Thanks for the reply and lets hope it goes to the moon!!!
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:26:51
I don't think so unless I take it out of the country. I am leaving the country as soon as this is behind me anyways. I got into trouble the day before I was flying out to Thailand for a month and a half. That is what sucks the most. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:49:22
Haha yes the system works very well.
@_date: 2016-02-29 10:36:07
Ya I'm in Seattle! Where you at?
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:31:59
Makes sense!
@_date: 2016-02-29 12:50:21
Haha I will definitely log on when I get through this. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:48:22
Thats what I am wondering!
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:38:49
Thanks. I was definately an interesting experience. Haha
@_date: 2016-02-29 07:30:13
That would be pretty badass!
@_date: 2016-02-29 12:40:52
I got charged with manufacturing hash. And there was my friends pistol there so I got a gun enhancement.
 
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:04:31
Yes an outdated one probably and Ya you can buy a little touch screen mp4 player but it is pretty limited on apps. But thats better than not having one. I will also be able to take college courses but they are limited. I can work too. But I am just so used to my fast lifestyle that it will be a major mental shock for the first few months. For the first six weeks I will go to an intake prison where they evaluate you and decide how violent you are so they can place you in the correct facility. They call it gladiator school because you are with all levels of violent people. After that its all good except for the fact that your in a cage! I am just gonna try and make the best of it and stay out of the prison drama unless I am in danger.
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:31:24
I wish that were the case for me! I blew most of my money on lawyers, bail, house arrest, fines, a BMW because they took my Volvo (which I got back in court thank jesus) and my Wife.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:09:02
Btc was at $850 and ETH was $10. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:08:26
That would be horrible! Damn!
@_date: 2016-02-29 07:34:11
 I am not a robot if thats what you mean. All flesh and bones here.  
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:49:58
I am not a violent person and I do believe based on the new laws in my state that they have reason to find me guilty although I though I was within the law. I got in trouble for manufacturing Hashish oil and there was my friends gun in the house so I got an enhancement. Cannabis is legal in my state. I had a small grow op in my garage that the feds didn't touch but used against me to justify raiding me. All they need is one weak person to prey on and scare into giving a statement that fits the needs of a search warrant. They were coming for money and property. They took a lot but were mad that there was no money. They were more evil and greedy than any of my pot smoking friends. Who needs flash grenades and machine guns for weed? If you don't wanna be helpful then don't. Just don't go out of your way to be unhelpful or hate on me for asking for advice.

Where do I get gold and silver for a good price?
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:11:40
Hahaha. It sucks when you are locked up and helpless. But i got over it pretty fast, got a divorce and moved on.
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:06:14
Where do I get gold from? It seems like all the places around here charge way more than the market price.
@_date: 2016-02-29 13:19:41
I noticed a lot of RemindMe so it must do something huh?
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:53:14
I think I will be fine without the protection thanks! I am going to a Minimum Security facility anyways!
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:15:54
I just don't have much knowledge on Gold, silver and platinum.
@_date: 2016-02-29 08:03:12
Thanks for the link I will probably do that.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:14:58
Jail Books are covered!
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:17:04
With my $10,000 investment I made it to over 400,000 and then it crashed and after some horrible trades I ended up with $37,500. At least I almost quadrupled my money.
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:37:52
Hahaha. That's an exellent idea. I will start planning my next job right now.
@_date: 2016-02-29 07:31:36
No she did not get into trouble just me thank god!
@_date: 2016-02-29 08:02:27
That would be awesome if you would do that for me!! Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:25:34
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:04:52
Really because that would help me out so much! Just send me your social security # and DOB and a picture ID with your public key so I can transfer them over!
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:59:43
I am glad too. I wasnt really worth it though. I just bought a car and pit some momey on a CBD farm in Oregon so hopefully i make some money in September when we harvest. It is nightfall farms on instagram if you wanna follow. It is the page with the pot leaf in the logo.
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:40:58
Do you mean other crypto currencies like lite coin and dogecoin?
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:04:04
Damn that's an expensive video card!! 👀
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:42:02
Hell ya it's always cool to have nice things!!
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:42:01
hasn't went up much since earlier!
