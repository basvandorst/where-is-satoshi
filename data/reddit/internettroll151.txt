We are all in deep shit if that bubble pops no matter how much crypto you own. 
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:07:57
So it's not a currency.  its settled

How long did it take for the Bitcoin to actually move?

It's sad that you think that and the point went right over your head. This has nothing to do with Trump or twitter
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:18:26
DEFIES TRUMP!

How dare you assume the gender. There are 25 choices of gender and people only think of 2.

They didn't net 200m. The gross amount was 200m. Easily made a few million today

This is why there will be a big sell off in January. A sell now pays tax in a few weeks. A sell on Monday and you have another year.  With tax reform in expect profit taking in January

Yes but unlike TD Ameritrade, Binance isn’t reporting to the IRS
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:55:23
Lol. IRS doesn’t give a shit about $100.

It's not about not being manipulated. It's about disclosing / the ability of the investor to be informed of who can manipulate the market.

i use my amazon card and get paid 5% in cash back. Why use BTC and pay fees? 
When merchants start accepting bitcoin (rather than using a service that pays in fait) - will the fees be paid by the merchant like current credit cards?
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:43:19
Right now I don't get lower prices if I pay with Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:20:22
There's no venture in established Bitcoin. There's no economic activity. Currencies aren't securities. SEC is being consistent. ICOs are a venture. 
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:44:22
Now so the same thing but invested in the stock market
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:41:44
That's what I wrote
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:12:48
So as a consumer, no benefits.

Universal health care but you have to pay to poop or pee
how stupid

What makes you think the pay ones are clean?

Is it because they believe in it or have FOMO? 
Most corporations are very risk adverse and play copy cat. Every CEO knows what blockchain is, or at least heard of it, and told someone else in their organization to go figure out if its real or how to use. Nobody is putting all their eggs in one basket, but they're not leaving them all out either. Hardly an endorsement.

Treasury yields are based on global demand. With emerging markets tanking, italy/Eurozone issues and China going down, there's stronger global demand for treasuries and the us dollar.  Corporate bond rates are also quite low making treasuries a popular choice. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:34:36
No it means bond yields will decrease. More demand means they can be auctioned off for less.

Assets and profits are not the same. DB has 1.5 trillion in assets and 63 billion in equity.

The Fed, under Obama, did print money. And the Fed chair testified to congress that they "effectively printed money"
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:33:47
lol. way before that.
The fed chairs have said this. It's just been a not so quiet secret that trump, like his typical self, is willing to air in public.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:12:57
That's what I said
Typically it's not good for financial markets for the president to be talking about printing money
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:12:21
So you agree with me. Got it.
