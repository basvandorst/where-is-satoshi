You are right, and I do appreciate you making your point.  However, I find that cricket communications gives similar security and reliability disclaimers about the use of their "real" SMS cellular service.   In all honesty, using text messaging for two step auth with google voice or any cellular SMS seems like a bad idea.  Any cell company could block messaging from a particular source for whatever reason (marketing, fishing, etc).  I hope Coinbase eventually works with true and secure two step authentication services such as Google Authenticator   or even     Perhaps they already do and I don't know it!  
From the coinbase website:
If you lose your phone (or otherwise cannot receive SMS codes on google voice) you will need to go through our reset process to restore access.
Alternatively, you can add a backup phone number (a friend, relative, or someone you trust) in case you lose access to your primary phone. You don't have to verify the backup phone number but adding it will send an SMS.

get a google voice account.  assign yourself a number.  use this number for coinbase verification.  when you login to coin base, check your  account for an SMS/TXT message.  Google voice accounts are free.
