Bitcoin waits for no man. Stop being scared and make profits. If you're scared to buy, understand the characteristics of the market and execute.

I understand how  the selling works, but I don't have a sophisticated wallet, and I don't fully trust Electrum. Paper wallet are a little over my head at this point. I came from stocks to crypto, whole new ball game. Appreciate the help, I have &lt;$100 in my portfolio so I'm not too worried about fork. I plan on diving in after tbh.
