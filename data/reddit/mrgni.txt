Isn't it that sanctions means that the companies are forbidden to sell goods to Iran even if they are getting paid for it? How a country can buy say 1000 tons of goods transferred to their country without USA noticing?

How exactly does it help ? Say they generated 1 BTC, sent it to a US bitcoin exchange and sold it for dollars. Now what ? The dollar is still in a US bank. They cannot transfer it back to Iranian bank due to sanctions. They can buy stuffs with bitcoin from other countries but how do they bring those inside their countries? So basically they can make money in foreign countries but cannot buy any physical goods that they can transfer to their countries. Can anyone explain?

They can buy secretly from other countries with bitcoin etc. but my question is more on how would they "ship" it to Iran without USA noticing? And remember we are talking about industrial scale not personal scale.
It is like say you have a million dollars but all paths to your home are blocked. What do you do with that million dollars if you are siting at home and can transfer money to anyone? And if they are able to ship large quantity of goods without USA suspecting they could probably sell large amount of oil secretly as well.

Cash has many benefits but some problems as well  
1. First of all it takes a lot of time to process and count changes from service end and customer. Can be problem in busy times.
2. It needs to be transferred from and to a Bank/ATM physically.
3. You have to know how much you are going to spend before going on shopping Or always carry a lot of extra "just in case"  
Bitcoin can replace credit card but there are a few problems which I hope will go away soon  
1. Reversing fraud charges can be a nightmare. 
2. Even with the fastest transaction it is way slower than credit card transaction
3. Huge fee. It can be direct fee or hidden by the price difference of buy vs sell

The right word is "Speculating"

If someone gets my credit card and pay for something I can open my account and report to reverse the charges. If someone does the same with my Bitcoin how do I reverse.
 
Lightning network also takes way longer than a credit card payment.
Tell me how I can pay you $3 worth of Bitcoin now for coffee and then you return me the same and both of our Bitcoin account balance is unchanged ( Except say 3 percent charge or so).

In practice if you use coinbase or something like that, which most people do, the situation is not much different.

The problem is that you never know which is the "Top" and which is the "Dip" until it is over. Generally I buy when the value goes down more than 10% and sell when it goes more than 10% up. I miss these kind of 25% rallies obviously.

Silver was very valuable once, until it was found in huge quantities in a few parts of the world. That is one reason of the demise of great Indian Economy

It will increase for sure (My belief so don't ask why) but it is unlikely to hit that much. I think because the amount of new money that needs to be put into. It has grown from $1 to $20K but doung another $20k jump is not the same considering same enthusiasm and many people jump into.  
There could also be strict government rules if they want to break it. Plus there could be technical weakness only revealed in future or better technology than blockchain we never know

The reason is same as people buy Apple shares at $200 but not at $22 when Apple just started.  
The reason people would buy bitcoin at higher price is because higher price shows it has a potential and it is out of the "Danger Zone"
