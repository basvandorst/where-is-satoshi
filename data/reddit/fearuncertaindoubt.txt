This is exciting news. I'm moving to the Philippines in a couple years.

You're telling me there's a chance I can be a millionaire? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:21:10
You're okay. I can see you have good intentions. We all want whats best for the community. Cheers!

**THIS**. also, I don't know why is offended. If you've watched AA's content, he always talks about what I just quoted above.

I like turtlesI quit Coinbase last weekend. Gemini hasn't let me down.

There's plenty of people in the community that are representing bitcoin, the only difference between him and the others is that he's not solely on Reddit and Twitter doing it. He's traveling all over the world speaking for free about the topic, face to face with thousands of people. 
I'm sure others would love to do the same, even you can do it if you'd like, but it's hard to find someone that can articulate, nor have the knowledge and free time to do so.
It just so happens that he does. Plus, we're on Reddit, and it's kind of hard to avoid any media content on anything bitcoin related on here. Maybe you can set a filter to block anything related to AA?
@_date: 2017-01-03 14:52:00
Cool. We're safe. For now
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:51:29
Listened to this guy for long time. I love his podcast as well. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 21:20:22
I had trouble worth coin base in the past. They shut down my account a few years ago. 
BUT recently they've stepped their game up and allowed me an option reactivate it.
After this good news, I think I'm gonna pull the trigger. I wonder if the IRS battle is the only thing holding me back?
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:22:56
The look in his eyes. You can't deny the truth and confidence in every word he says. He makes me want to close my Bank Account tonight and go full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-04 05:48:44
I risked it all. ALL of it.
Now I'm going to retire from my day job because of the massive returns.
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:51:44
How can a pleb like me test out LN? I'd love to see it in action.
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:59:17
To those that recommended me nitrogensports, thank you so much. I've quadrupled the amount of btc that i had in just a week. 
Go Warriors!

1. We did
2. Because "hodl"
@_date: 2017-01-01 22:50:07
I stopped annoying them about it. Now I'm just preparing to diversify my investment into other assets, and if they ever ask me how I was able to retire so young, I'm gonna say, "oh. Remember that digital currency you kept laughing at me about?"
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:54:18
Isn't there talk about it getting to about 95% around late Feb/March?
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:10:09
I can't imagine what happens when/if we start implementing Lightning Network.
In my opinion, the price at 1k is still very cheap. A single bitcoin a few years from now is going to be worth a lot
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:19:58
This is exciting news. I plan to move to the Philippines very soon.
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:06:41
I honestly thought it was the same person.
@_date: 2017-01-17 21:26:45
Were you looking for sites? I recently tripled my bitcoin holding by betting that the Warriors would beat the Cavs on MLK day.
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:32:15
I personally think by 2024 that even a single bitcoin is more than enough.

Edited my post.  I forgot that killing my d&amp;d players in the most fashionable way is top priority right now.
@_date: 2017-01-15 07:14:00
I would sit through an entire ad for this
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:31:44
That's amazing. I'm interested in doing something similar. What's the website you used?
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:32:38
I'm waiting for all this lightning network stuff to be common.
Helps with the anxiety.

Thought the same as well. I have fun gambling some of mine during the NFL playoff season or NBA. Easy way to double if you knew sports.
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:58:41
I'll check that out thanks

I've thought this as well. BUT I also feel that I should hodl and when the price dips to its lowest to just buy more.

You realize a lot of us have throwaway accounts on reddit and even older accounts on Bitcointalk, right? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:32:36
My guess is when they found out that Samsung is affiliated with the EEA, that maybe they're using it to get ETH? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:06:58
Shh don't give them any ideas
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:02:50
Ethereum has fundamental issues? That's cool. Tell that to the EEA. Lol

I've admitted on here that I gamble with bitcoin. The Golden State Warriors winning streaks these past two seasons have been profitable.
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:58:07
Went through something similar. Now I use Gemini.

Just read the comments on the related videos on this. People are already saying that they've stopped paying out. lol don't be a sucker

I'm done. You're embarrassing yourself. Lol
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:08:06
this is insane. i literally just did a parlay bet between the SF Giants and Chi Cubs and won .9 btc
I couldn't be more happier. It's like i won three times today.

How many times we gotta make a thread like this. Didn't we try this three years ago and failed horribly?
