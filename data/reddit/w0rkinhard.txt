You can look at the rich list and see millions of BTC not moved in many years. Are they lost? Never to be touched again?
Then you got whales buying recently that'll hold.
By 2032 about 600,000 BTC left to be mined.
By then there should be numerous ways to buy BTC. Price will be so high.
Anyone selling now doesn't want to be mega rich in 10 years.

Only 21,000,000 people can own 1 BTC.
We have 4,236,975 BTC left to be mined.
Satoshi owns what a million?
Man addresses have tens of thousands of BTC not moved in years.
Probably a ton lost.
Many whales own over 10 BTC.
For all we know 10,000,000 people will end up owning more than 1 BTC. Maybe a lot less than 10 million people.
If BTC were to ever truly take off then people holding 10 BTC will be worth a million dollars in 1-2 years. Then will be multi millionaires sometime between 2020-2030
Yet we got non-believers dumping hundreds of BTC this last week. 
I suppose if you got millions of dollars worth of BTC you can sell now and enjoy life. Hold the rest for later and the rest will be worth tens of millions of dollars.
Life is good being in the 21 Bitcoin club or higher.

I keep all my BTC on an exchange. Never know when BTC might crash and you need to quickly sell.
I'll be thinking of you holders though panic plugging in your hardware wallet and trying to figure out what high fee to use to get your coins to an exchange in under 6 hours.

Looking at that address they didn't get all of them yet. Still have unconfirmed transactions from weeks ago.

Bitstamp been around for years. Bitmex been around for years. Gdax been around for a while. Gemini been around for a while.
I spread my BTC around and will take my chances that all the exchanges I use don't shutdown at the same time.

My plan is if I become Bitcoin rich to the point I don't need to work and can just sell a little bit of BTC every month then I'll do this.
Travel around and sell some BTC for cash on localbitcoins.
Pay for everything in cash. Find a place to live that accepts cash on Craigslist.
Take a bus from city to city. 
Just enjoy life. Live low key.
Not like I'm gonna have a family, kids, house, cars and pay for everything with BTC and never report it on my taxes.
I'll live off the grid. 
First BTC needs to hit like $50,000

Hold the 1 BTC for 10 years and if you're still alive you can probably retire if BTC mooned.
But you also gotta keep an eye on other coins. They could moon more if large money backs the coin and pumps it a ton.

Convert to another coin and move it for cheaper.

 to buy BTC 
and  for alts.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:05:32
LOL this happens to me. I hate trying to trade and drive.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:20:34
Not like I'm gonna buy a house and a car. I'm gonna airbnb or craigslist find a place to live and bounce city to city. Just need a place to live and food. Can do that low key / under the radar easily. Plus doing it that way I can spend like $15,000-$20,000 a year. Just need BTC to hit like $60,000 and I'm set.

Exactly. I could do everything the boring way. Study, gain experience, get promoted, make more, invest well and retire in 30ish years. 
Or risk all my money in crypto and since it's new I could increase my net worth by the hundreds of thousands in a few years and if things go well retire in 5 years instead of 30.
If I lose it all then I'm back to working for basically the rest of my life.

Early adopters get rich pumping BTC and then influence politics around the world with their money to make BTC even better and worth more so they get even more rich.
Things are just beginning. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:27:16
I saw a tweet that said if 1% of all the money in a bunch of different things (gold, silver, stocks, etc) went into BTC then BTC would be around $87,000
But I find that hard to believe. That's a lot of money that can buy a lot of coins. Would you find that many sellers at $87,000
So who knows how high the price could go.

Visiting BTC is like being all in on the_donald and visiting r/politics
Bad for your health.

Loophole is not to pay and hope you didn't make enough for them to care enough to come after you.
If you're selling $500,000 and buying a house and 2 cars and a boat and not pay taxes then they might care. Sell $40,000 to pay off debt they may not care.
I personally haven't paid any taxes. But then again I don't sell hundreds of thousands of dollars worth every year.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:24:07
I've thought about that too. Seeing 2 years ago coins with a market cap of $10,000 or $100,000 now have market caps of $10,000,000 or $100,000,000
Huge gains in 2 years for buying and holding shitcoins.
But I wouldn't know where to begin today. Too many coins and too many altcoin exchanges.

Plus some guy commented a while back saying if all you file is a W2 and you are just a single dude with 1 job then they don't really care.
They only have time to go after the larger fish. Especially after BTC blew up. There are probably hundreds of thousands of Americans not paying taxes. 
Unless it's automated then it'll be hard to track everyone down. They would have to hire way more people at the IRS to contact people not paying their $5,000 in capital gains. It's more likely they would go after someone not paying $250,000 in capital gains instead.

All depends on how much money you have. 
OMG, QTM, ZEC are on bigger exchanges and some what cheap.
Then you got the big market cap coins good for a pump. 
Anything under OMG, QTM, ZEC for market cap is a gamble.

I find doing the opposite of what everyone else is doing aka fighting the trend is a good way to get rekt.

Guidelines might come out before you file your 2018 taxes so they don't want you to think the same laws apply to 2018 trading.
