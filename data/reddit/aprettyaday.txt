Yes it is which is why Expedia has started to accept bitcoins now.
@_date: 2014-05-17 12:05:58

@_date: 2014-09-23 09:44:27

A Highway Patrolman waited outside a popular bar, hoping for a bust.
At closing time everyone come out and he spotted his potential quarry. The man was so obviously inebriated that he could barely walk. He stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, looking for his car.
After trying his keys on five other cars, he finally found his own vehicle. He sat in the car a good ten minutes, as the other patrons left. He turned his lights on, then off, wipers on, then off. He started to pull forward into the grass, then stopped.
Finally, when he was the last car, he pulled out onto the road and started to drive away.
The patrolman, waiting for this, turned on his lights and pulled the man over. He administered the breathalyzer test, and to his great surprise, the man blew a 0.00.
The patrolman was dumbfounded. "This equipment must be broken!" he exclaimed.
"I doubt it," said the man, "Tonight I am the designated decoy!"

Thanks but I couldn't figure it out, I asked but, no one responded, it looks a bit fishy to me and they seem to be paying in uBtc, which is not worth the effort.
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:09:29
just wait and withdraw when you have enough. or tip it forward.
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:34:23

@_date: 2014-05-17 13:05:15
I know man! but there was a debate on a forum on how provably fair isn't so provably fair but I don't wanna go there, as I said, it seems unfair when one is losing and I don't blame them, it was my decision to gamble and I lost. 
And LOL, you can't stop now? can you?, well Good luck to you buddy, just be careful!
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:29:10

I got in a fight one time with a really big guy, and he said, "I'm going to mop the floor with your face." I said, "You'll be sorry." He said, "Oh, yeah? Why?" I said, "Well, you won't be able to get into the corners very well."

@_date: 2014-05-13 19:45:39
My favorite thing about bitcoin is that I can keep it safely in my cold store wallet and never worry about someone stealing it.
@_date: 2014-05-17 12:41:58
I've tried all strategies but maybe it was my luck or maybe the dice was rigged and maybe because I was losing, to me it seemed rigged but whatever it was I kept losing and it didn't took long to lose it all. I tried 95% odds even 98% but after 1 -2 bets it would hit like 99 or 98.1 and bust!
I am not complaining not whining but I am just trying to warn you that don't go back!, It's your money you can do whatever you want with it but you might end up losing it and then you'll regret it like I do now.
@_date: 2014-06-07 11:43:11
so what's the best way to change client seed automatically after every bet?
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:10:27
How do one sees how much one has in his/her changetip account?
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:38:10

@_date: 2014-05-13 19:57:50
Congratz buddy, I wish to have that feeling one day of having a whole complete Bitcoin! and I am really really far from mine :(
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:45:53
I don't have a particular set of skills to offer on-line, I am sorry, If I did, I'd work at Fiverr or somewhere like that. 
I am just trying find a legitimate way of making mBtc s, that's all.
Even if it takes the whole day to make 1, just wanna try something I have in mind.
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:12:51
Thanks! upped!

I don't know how you did it but I have lost around .25 BTC on various dice sites (don't want to take names).
And my advice to you is DON'T go back!! spend your money elsewhere or you'll end up losing it all.
@_date: 2014-06-01 08:11:31
Very good information! I am going to file a report! Thanks
