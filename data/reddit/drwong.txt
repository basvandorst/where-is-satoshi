@_date: 2018-08-08 11:56:11
The problem with this argument is that plenty of people who are stressed didnt buy during the period that you are zooming out to.

 But its not cool to force that on someone imo. If you really want your friends to be into crypto then talk to them about why you like it and let them make up their own mind.
Being overbearing and domineering about your economic views to your friend isnt the answer for mass adoption imo
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:30:58
Do they take ltc?
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:21:09
How does crap like this get upvoted? Lol
@_date: 2019-03-03 01:36:53
100% 
I hodl a decent amount of btc and enjoy investing in cryptos but thats a deuche move to insist on btc if your friend clearly prefers cash, check, zelle, or venmo.
