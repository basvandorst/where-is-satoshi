Nevermind. I was lazy and did apt-get install tor instead of following the commands on torproject.org:
You need to add the following entry in /etc/apt/sources.list or a new file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/:
deb  trusty main
deb-src  trusty main
Then add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running the following commands at your command prompt:
gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89
gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -
You can install it with the following commands:
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
all is well.

is it too out of the question to believe that by the time he is unfrozen quantum computing would make bitcoin security obsolete? SHA256, while not truly known (since the tech doesn't exist) to be 100% brute-force-proof, is good enough against today's tech. what about tomorrow's? what if it becomes possible to brute force a public key, so the protocol evolves, but the person frozen can't evolve with it in time? poor guy could wake up broke.

the only thing i can realistically see them doing is creating their own bitcoin clone called bankcoin where there is no coin cap and to run a node you must be a bank. BoA tells M&amp;T run a node and you'll have a copy of our ledger, now use it as well and we will also have your ledger. when a customer wants to transfer 500$ from us to you, you'll know it instantly.
they are now using bitcoin tech without using bitcoin.
i'm not saying that it's better than a shared database but it'll be better than ACH.

you're looking at this wrong. the price reflection will be in coinbase's stock if they go public. nothing to do with bitcoin. they didn't buy $75MM of BTC. to see an increase in btc price you need users, users that will swing the scale of the daytraders whirling of cash in/out of the system so that the price will go up and not be volatile.
the news is good but you won't see price increases until that happens.

Honestly I'm not too sure if the "Extinguish" bit is completely out of the question - i.e., the gov't performing a 51% attack on the BTC network thereby destroying it. How much $ would that cost for them to accomplish that?
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:48:44
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:10:29
It would, for the time being:
Grinding the network to a halt would destroy bitcoin, as now no transactions can occur if they so allow it. So my question still stands, at the current hashing power, how much $ would it take to allow the gov't to do this?
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:51:00
yeah. i'd imagine they'd ask you about that. next time do a 1 total, which is stupid. but, hey, banks.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:25:41
Honestly not trolling. I'm interested in the "Extinguish" bit and would rather not solely focus on the 51% attack vector, but I'll still reply to what you talked about above (the article):
It's stated that:
* it's never happened before so no one really knows what will happen
* "low, in my opinion, but maybe I’m not sufficiently paranoid about Big Banks or Big Government using Dirty Tricks to shut down Bitcoin" - let's assume that they would/could since that's what we're talking about
* it's claimed that "at most" a couple of hours transactions would be stalled until a code change can make it in to go around the attack ("Ignore a longer chain...")
So really the article is just theorizing. Again, the amount of $ the gov't needs to spend to get this hardware is what? most likely a drop in the bucket for them, but I looked it up:
Current difficulty:
299,160,145 GH/s
To get &gt; 50%:
(299,160,145 / 2) + 1 = **149,580,073.5 GH/s** needed to get 51%
700gh/s for $1,379 - needs:
149,580,073.5 / 700 = 213,686 units
213,686 * $1,379 = $294,672,994 dollars to pull off a 51% attack (not including electricity)
This was spending in 2011
Take 294mill out of the 2% spent on education (70 billion) - this amount of money is nothing to them.
Now that I've answered that question for myself, what are other attack vectors for the Extinguish part??

Well ... hold on. I've been bouncing back and forth between and for a little bit now, and I'll try to draw some analogies but might go down a rabbit hole or two. Read it, and let me know your thoughts:
1) Yes, this increases the blocksize but BU wants a **literal** blocksize increase. They want on-chain transactions, not off-chain potential transactions in the future. They don't want extra code to perform this blocksize increase just the simple code that switches the 1MB to XMB. There's a lot more to their arguments but really I don't want to delve into that.
2) I think there might be a general fear about some ulterior motive by blockstream which maybe isn't obvious to everyone else, whether it's suffocating bitcoin or some other money making plans, I don't know and not sure if I should care - if anything nefarious does come to light or make itself known an obvious node/miner switch will be swift I'm sure. Honestly I'm not sure if everyone is seeing the forest for the trees at this point in time in bitcoin's evolution or if they're just stuck on some arms-length vision of "this is segwit and that's all we're getting" mentality. In my mind either Segwit happens and we're open to a shit ton of other awesome possibilities that takes us to the next level, or, was right and Segwit happens and next thing we know our txs are being siphoned off to blockstream &amp; their cronies. Worst case scenario, like I said before, everyone switches off the Core software and moves to BU, problem solved - unless of course I'm missing something I'm not thinking about that might actually jail your coins to core and not allow you to move off that everyone in both of these subs are missing.
tldr; are literalists. are trying to avoid a hard blocksize increase. Don't confuse the two.

What are the infection vectors? Honestly the ONLY defense here is creating OFFLINE signed transactions, and then taking that signed transaction to a connected online machine:
The only attack vector there would be the USB drive you need to plug in to move the transactions to the online machine. However, since the offline machine would always be offline, this is a moot point since no keylogger in the world can make an offline machine suddenly become online.

So instead of using a tried and true solution - a postgres database - they are using "blockchain tech" that will require ALL of their banks across the world to be running some software that allows them to utilize citicoin?


This exists already, and it's called Ripple. Which is still shitty but they're first to market in this realm and will beat "citicoin". Waste of their resources.

Also realize once it's swept into electrum that address does not become part of the seed of addresses electrum creates. I'd then send those coins to one of the electrum addresses, otherwise if you ever need to restore your electrum wallet using the 12 word seed your swept address will not be in there

The next logical step is for coinbase to stop accepting USD altogether. If you think about it, that's perfect monetary control for the government. You force users to buy USDC first with USD, then only have a BTC-USDC pair. Selling BTC for USD is no longer now possible, and assets can be immediately frozen whenever they want.

I'm really really going to try to make my response not result in a flame war or fight about what's better than what, but really this is not difficult and I'll just detail out my experience:
I first started like everyone else by using bitcoin-qt client. This was nice and all, and I had an extremely long 200char password to decrypt the wallet, and another 500char password on a trucrypt container to put that wallet in and place on the cloud and some other places. To keep track of the password (and autogenerate) I use keepass. I have used keepass since my online poker days, and know full well the terrible consequences of having weak passwords, since frequenting 2p2 forums and reading about high rollers getting the UB accounts passwords guessed and drained of tens of thousands of dollars from chip dumping.
Then, after all of that and using bitcoin for a little, I read about change addresses. This freaked me out, and I had no idea how to deal with it. The reason this is scary is because once you make a purchase you have no real way of knowing (at least in bitcoin-qt) if your last encrypted backup contained your new change address. The amount of duplication of files was starting to become extraordinary and a waste of time.
I finally bit the bullet and read/played with/understood electrum. I now just have copies in a separate keepass database my 12 word seed both in the cloud and on usb drives. I never need to update any files or wallets ever again. I downloaded Mycelium on my phone where I've transferred 1 coin to give to friends if they ask, and added my public key of my main electrum stash as a watch only address on my phone.
The security aspect isn't hard. Really. Just make sure you have a good keepass password. Keepass even lets you use a yubi key.

website design isn't an easy trail to walk. i don't think you'd be posting this if you actually knew how difficult it was; there's two sides to this equation. web browser development which includes not only desktop but mobile views. you also need to consider every browser, and when i say every browser i'm not just talking chrome/safari/opera/ie, i'm also saying VERSIONS of those browsers. especially IE.
now ... include email which is what you're boo booin' about. email headers can be specified as html like browsers, but guess what? every EMAIL CLIENT now needs to be accounted for. this shit isn't easy. just be lucky you're getting a decently formatted html email.

The only solution I can see is somehow convincing the bitcoin community to merge-mine some new coin they invent that won't be used as a store of value but will allow large payloads in the OP_RETURN to store large amounts of data, thereby stepping around bitcoin the currency

Interesting, I guess I'm a little nervous about forward versions of electrum. I am using both bitcoin and litecoin's electrum for my addresses. If, say 10 years from now, we are forward 50~ versions of electrum, if at some point the way the addresses were generated was broken, I'd be out of luck unless I had (or could find) the version I used to generate my initial addresses 10 years ago.
I guess I should write down/store my github download of electrum somewhere too. Kind of scary.

i wanted to do something like this by running for mayor of my city. my whole platform was just going to be "i work for you". my debates weren't going to be debates, as after every question my answer would be "whatever the people decides".
i want to create my own coin that has no value, and do like you say - mail out paper letters with the user's public/private key. literally every bill that would come across my desk would have a public address associated with it that people could send coins to to vote on.
if i didn't end up voting the way the majority of the people wanted, i could be removed from office. it creates perfect transparency and perfect democracy.
the only issue i see being the cost of mailing out these letters, tying them to "real" households (or tax payers i guess) and then having the people use the technology.

Cryptocurrencies are a disgrace to the human race. They are certainly qualitatively different from national currencies that are issued by a national government and backed by that nation's economic capacity. In an intelligent world that kind of currency would be the only one in use. Essentially, the value of that kind of currency is its claim on the products and services created by the economy that issued the currency. Intelligent management of the currency keeps its supply in synch with the growth of the national economy's capacity. The cost of creating the currency has no significance to its value.
Gold has some attraction as an alternative because its value might survive some cataclysmic collapse of the modern world. For the few who managed to survive into a new stone age perhaps their gold might retain some value. Gold does have the value of durability and limited prospects for sudden expansion of its supply.
By contrast cryptocurrencies are a con created by criminals to serve criminals. The only real value of cryptocurrencies is their independence from any intelligent government control. No doubt that feature is good for the drug trade and the cyber criminals. But, the idea that some data has value just because it takes a large amount of energy and a large amount of computing resources to create it is ridiculous. Use of carbon for this kind of purpose is emblematic of human self destruction. Nor is there any realistic expectation of the durability of crypto currencies across some large scale disaster that destroyed the modern world and its technology. Even for believers the ability of cryptocurrencies to hold their value is open to large question. It just takes computing power and electricity to create them at will and the pattern has been for large scale improvements in the effectiveness of computing power.
