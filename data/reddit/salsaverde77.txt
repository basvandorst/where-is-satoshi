Youre an idiot if you think this is brilliant. It’s like saying “hey give me $10 and I’ll give you $1000” cmon now

For those who aren’t aware, there was a phenomenon that happened back in the 1600’s that made a tulip extremely valuable. You could buy a house on the ocean with just one tulip. It’s called tulipmania. Do some research.

No, no it was not, need some help reading pal?
“The best guess for the price tomorrow IS the price today”
It’s ok, you corrected yourself 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:50:59
“The best guess for the price tomorrow is something close to the price today” would have been a better statement that actually made sense . Me guessing the price tomorrow is going to be the price today, is a stupid guess/assumption. Hope ya learned something

lmao, thank you for reiterating the first comment, didn’t say anything new 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:51:06
This is the stupidest fucking comment I’ve ever read,
It sounds good,,,
But that means the price would literally never change,,,
If the price is 6,800 then the price tomorrow would be 6,800, and using that genius philosophy it’d be the sameness price again the next day
It’s ok, I know you’re going’s to downvote 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:11:52
Now that sounds better!! but that is not what you said in the first comment

I don't think you know what anecdotal means kid. Thousands of before have had this problem which is the truth. Avoid the square app OP. Clover is much better,  or pay pal

DO NOT USE THE SQUARE APP. I used them for one day with my small business, they then froze my account and kept my money.  This has happened to THOUSANDS of people.  Do a little research on YouTube to listen to what other people have to say about it.  Search square app scam.  Please DO NOT use this app.
