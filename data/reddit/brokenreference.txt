FinCEN doesn't work with the IRS though.

For a second I thought you meant bitcoin will crash to $28.10. But reading your second comment, it makes sense.

You know, Coinbase is based in SF, California, and it's still 7AM there. They're probably still asleep, and I wouldn't be surprised if trading is automatically paused when they can't reach the Bitstamp API.

Sort of. See

Sweet, any plans on support for USD? ;)

It's not that hard to create a fake transaction w/localbitcoins (fake meaning, not between 2 different people). Just create 2 accounts and send between each other. Sure there's a 1% fee, but it's pretty easy to give the illusion that someone bought BTC at a very high price.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:01:14
The thing that you have to understand is bitcoins cannot just disappear. They may be in an inconsistent state, but ultimately they will either be in one address or in another. 
I've personally never had this problem, but I'm pretty sure you should just wait and try again. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:33:12
You did not pay a transaction fee: 
You'll need to wait a few days, and then if the transaction doesn't go through you can backup your wallet, reset Bitcoin-Qt, reimport your wallet, and try sending the coins again.

Localbitcoins also has online transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:33:17
He has one...
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:39:42
The rate is set when the buyer makes the offer. That's why, as a seller, I have a notice that if the exchange rate changes I have the right to cancel the transaction and request a new one be initiated.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:18:11
Not that I'm aware of. :/

The bastard probably has his own stash that he wants to appreciate in value.

Check the sidebar on the right for answers to most of your questions!
Right now, bitcoin is still speculative IMO, but it certainly holds a lot of potential for the future! It's still a risky investment, but it's good to diversify your portfolio, and putting all your savings under your mattress in inflationary currency (i.e. USD) isn't a good idea. (There is a limited amount of bitcoins, 21 million.)
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:59:07
Again, I would have a stipulation in your listing saying that the exchange rate would be determined at the time of transfer. If the buyer's trying to be a smartass by trying to buy during a dip then I would just cancel the order and have him/her place another one when you meet in person.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:23:40
Yes, that should do it. Just make sure you back up! Perhaps try importing the wallet into blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:03:12
Maybe it's a throwaway for privacy reasons. 
@_date: 2013-09-09 05:27:23
Looks promising, but it's a bit disappointing the only deposit/withdrawal methods are BTC and LTC. :/
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:30:12
or you can sell on bitstamp. but besides, i wouldn't sell
