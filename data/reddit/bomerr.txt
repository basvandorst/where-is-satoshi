Good luck getting bitcoin adaption to increase with that attitude. 
The problem is your average user on the street values being able to call customer support if they get locked out of their account. Sure you might not care but given your demographics (reddit user on bitcoin sub), your values are niche and not representative of the more popular values needed to see bitcoin grow.

What kind of regulation? The only type I see is taxation, which is occurring starting Jan 1. in USA or banning it outright. BTC is just a more complex version of any fad like Tulips, Pokemon Cards or Fidget Spinners. What's there to regulate? It's just people speculating on an asset. 


Because that would defeat the purpose of crypto. Crypto is designed to be virtual. Tieing it down to a real asset like gold would make it gold. So why bother dealign with the entire crypto layer when you could just buy gold directly?

I would divest from crypto. It's a total bubble and it'll collapse soon. 
Stealth Phase was when the Winklevoss Twins invested in BTC back in 2013.
Awareness Phase has been last few years where co. like Deloitte Consulting were hiring for blockchain skills.
2017 has been Mania phase with 1300% price increase and media hype.
All the good media hype was in 2017. Now it's going to be more regulations and more news articles about how dangerous bitcoin is. BTC has been a wild ride and we're damn near the end at this point of this bubble.

There are far too many problems with Crypto ever becoming mainstream adopted.


Possibly Ripple and IOTA, not because they are necessary good (in fact I think Ripple has no future) but because those coins are large and not yet listed in GDAX. I expect to see them listed on GDAX and pumped before they are dumped.

Where are you getting any of this from? 
Winklevoss Twins invested in BTC and got insanely lucky. They even stated that "BTC was either total B$ or going to change the world." Turns out it was B$ but they were still able to buy low sell high.
It doesn't appear that BTC will crash the economy because so few people have invested compared to sub-prime loans. Similarly Wall Street hasn't invested in crypto like they did with the sub-prime derivatives. The bubble will be relegated to a lot of hipster millennials and generation Xers losing their cash.
MSM is warning people against BTC and trying to stop people from getting defrauded. I generally hate the media for fake news but this situation could not be any more ironic. Likewise with bank CEOs warning about BTC too. 
People are being greedy and investing in crypto to make a quick buck. Some are true believers and think BTC will change the world, despite it being 9 yr old tech. 
No conspiracy, just a perfect storm.

You've replaced traditional banks with cryptobanks (coinbase). If they close your account then you're done. It's the same problem as before with traditional banking.

Compared to 2014, there is an entire altcoin market for whales to pump and dump, which is what they are doing at present. Everything went parabolic last month and right now people are squeezing all the profit out of this market before they dump it. This time it'll be for good because all the media attention has attracted all the people willing to invest and because the media has already warned people about the dangers of this market. 
Thank about it. BTC increased in value during 2017 because of a lot of good news such as the Japanese Govt. legalizing it, the hard forks (aka free money) and speculation about futures trading. Do you expect to see this level of positive news in the future? My guess is we're likely to see the opposite which is bad news such as government regulation or taxation.

Bitcoin is a Pyramid Scheme. As new people buy BTC and raise up the price, earlier adopters can sell their BTC for a high price.


Only a small amount of bitcoins are traded daily. On GDAX it's 33k coins daily right now OUT OF 15 MILLION. I don't know what the volume is on the other exchanges so I'll estimate only 1-5% of all BTCs are in circulation. That means it's incredibly easy for someone (like Satoshi with 1 million coins) to crash the market if they dump all their bitcoins.


The problem with bitcoin's network, it's concerned 80% in China and the top 10 pools control over 75% of the hashing power. The BTC network is a POINT OF WEAKNESS NOT AN ADVANTAGE. If China cracked down hard on the miners (because they are a totalitarian regime after all) it would completely destabilize the network. If BTC became mainstream then the Chinese govt would have incentive to do that. Or force the pools to hack the currency since they control over 51% of the hashing power.


If I send money to a wrong address then the funds are lost forever. If I lose my wallet key then the funds are lost forever. Once people realize the drawbacks of BTC outwight any benefits, it will drop like a rock. This is a fad. It is tulips. It is Pokemon cards. It is beanie babies. it is fidget spinners. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:26:17
it's pump and dump. whales manipulating the price, suckers left holding the bags hoping the price keeps going up. without actual value, not speculation, the price won't increase.
the problem is we are in a bubble so people are investing blindly, hence there is a big delay between when people invest in a coin and when they realize there is no substance. 
now that the big blue chips (btc, ltc, eth) have been pumped and most of your alt coins pumped too, the end is near for this market. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:30:28

2. An infinite number of altcoins can be produced.

Most of the people getting in right now are doing so because it's a get rich quick scheme. They have no idea about the underlying technology besides maybe some marketing fluff, if even that. Believing BTC will become mainstream mass adoption without knowing the fundamentals is very much wishful thinking.
IMO BTC will never reach mass adoption. As I already said, it's not user-friendly or idiot-proof and that is by design, because of decentralization. More importantly major Wall Street cash will NEVER enter the crypto market because it's too dangerous. Why would I spent 100k on 1 BTC when Satoshi has 1m coins and could cash them out and completely collapse the market? If you aren't an early adopter, BTC appears to be a pyramid scheme to new investors. Once people realize this will never go mainstream, the market will collapse. Given the media coverage right now, I would estimate maybe a month or 2 before the collapse, 6 months MAX.

2017 has been Mania phase with 1300% price increase and media hype. 


LOL. I see this cited all the time. Do you remember when bitcoin was cool because it was going to destroy banking? Now people are cheering because bankers will get rich from BTC. Brilliant. 
But let's get real. **INTUITIONAL INVESTORS WILL NEVER EVER EVER NEVER EVER INVEST IN BITCOIN EVER!!!!!** Okay? Why would a prudent investor buy a ONE bitcoin for 20k+ when Satoshi has ONE MILLION coins and could easily crash the market, taking all the profit? These investors are already filthy rich and they don't need 20 or 300 or 2000% YOY increases. The current BTC market is for people that are GREEDY. 


What do you expect to see in 2018? All the good media hype was in 2017. Now it's going to be more regulations and more news articles about how dangerous bitcoin is. BTC has been a wild ride and we're damn near the end at this point of this bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:04:19
Most people's opinions are wrong because they are based on baseless assumptions, shallow thinking or just repeating what other people said. My opinion is much more likely because it's based on critical thinking. 
In a nutshell. BTC was supposed to become a bubble back in 2014 but the Mt. Gox hacking destroyed confidence in crypto. So Crypto went dormant until this year when Japan legalized BTC as legal tender. This decision rekindled the market. Then BTC kept on growing through speculating about hard-forks and futures trading. Post thanksgiving, there was a massive pouring of new money into the currency and that caused it to go exponential. Without even more people fueling the growth and without more speculating or good news, the bull run is over.
If you look at the recent crash compared to all the prior, in the priors BTC would easily rebound and break it's ATH. Now it's struggling and breaking supporting lines. In addition, we can see that dumb money is causing pump and dumps of every alt coin possible. The market is collapsing. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:02:44
I don't think there will be another bull cycle. Most (or All from what I am aware of) blockchains are useless for the general public. Maybe in the future a company will find a use for blockchain or crypto, in which case that companies stock will rise. But the current currencies will all die out and never rebound. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:30:21


The final crash will be less than 1k, maybe even less than $250. With the current trend, I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction down to 10k within a few weeks. 


There aren't any more 100000% returns to make. A few altcoins might have that ability but all the easy money is gone as this point 


I've only been seriously interested in BTC for the last month. For me this is easy come, easy go. Hell the entertainment value itself was worth it. But I couldn't imagine wasting 5+ years of life on this and have very little to show for it, which is what will happen to all the cold storage hodlers. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:54:47
It will crash and we are close to the end now. What's different about this time compared to prior years is that BTC is finally mainstream with CEOs like Jamie Dimon coming out against it. The time period between each mooning and correction was decreasing in 2017. Options trading is finally online which means big whales will be able to bet against the market. I think we're 1-2mo away from the crash. 6mo MAX.

China has electricity for 4c/kwh so most of the miners are in China as well. That's why the Chinese pools are the largest. If the miners were located in America or Europe then they would connect to those pools. 
As the block reward decreases, mining will become less and less profitable which will push miners out of business in high electricity area, further concentrating mining in countries like China.

The problem is that for most people BTC is WORSE than traditional banking. 
With BTC you have to pay fees to the miners. Is that any better than paying interest to a bank? 
With a traditional bank, if you send payment to a wrong address or you lose the password to your account, there is customer support to help. With BTC, you are screwed. It's a pyramid scheme de facto, not de jure. 
BTC will never become mainstream to justify the current economic valuation so the people that will benefit are those that invested early and are able to get out before the crash.

Bingo, we got a winner here. You are completely right. BTC is a scam.  I'll answer your questions since I doubt most people here will want to admit the problems with BTC.


By uptake, I assume you mean usage increase, not stock price increase. Correct, BTC was the original blockchain that launched everything. The alt coins are tweets of the BTC protocol, some more different than others but right now none has become mainstream because there use cases are limited, just like BTC.


No. The community is divided regarding how to take BTC. BTC's benefits are that it's decentralized but a lot of the improvements necessary to make it more function require centralization. In order to get adoption, it requires consent from all parties (miners, exchanges, users, etc.) so it's incredibly different to get everyone agree to changes.
In addition the core dev team isn't concerned with price swings or what the average mainstream person wants at this second. They are very much slow and steady even if that causes scaling issues.


No clue, but probably not. And think about how devastating an argument over PoW or PoS would be to common people trusting BTC. 


These are the shortcomings you mentioned above and they have existed since the beginning, 9 years. Decide for yourself if they will be fixed or not. 


Here is a core problem with BTC. Let's say I am a great programmer and I find a way to improve BTC. What incentive do I have to improve BTC vs. start my own altcoin? Satoshi and the original miners control a large # of coins. That's essentially equity. So they benefit from my work while I get nothing. The problem tho is that any coin with a central figure will have conflict of interest, because that coin getting more popular will help that founder which people won't like. Hence alt coins have technological strengths but people also don't like them.


Probably, but that implies this technology will continue forward and right now it looks like a dead-end that'll never become mainstream. 


BINGO. This is the core problem of bitcoin. It's not idiot-proof and so it will become become mainstream adopted. The technological is suited to a niche audience because the drawbacks stop it from being practical for the average user. 


Yep. It's a catch 22.


The real problem with reliability is that 70% of the hashing power is located in China. If BTC ever became popular, it's not impossible for those people to band together and hack the network or for the Chinese govt. to shut down the miners would disrupt the world BTC protocol. In theory BTC is supposed to be decentralized and trustless, and the software is, but the hardware is physical and located in real countries.


Governments will tax bitcoin. FYI bitcoin is not anonymous. You can trace every single transaction through the blockchain IF you can link an address to a real person. That's why privacy coins exist like Monero.


No it's still a speculative asset. My guess is the price jump is a result of the big whales trying to get out of the industry and pumping this stock up one last time before the big crash. 
The timeline for the price action is that early in 2017, Japanese govt legalized BTC as legal tender. Then you had the hard forks which people invested because these forked coins might replace BTC and they were free dividends. Then futures trading as announced so people piled in expecting Wall Street to invest in December and when that didn't occur, it dropped to the current price.
 My opinion is that the bubble is very close to collapsing, probably within 2 months, 6 months max.

What problem is XRP trying to solve? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:22:04
try 2 months. 6 tops.

!RemindMe 2 months

Do you notice how the Winklevoss Twins didn't comment on how many BTC they own nor on how many the sold? And they started smirking when they talked about how BTC could be total BS. I think they have sold a large number of their coins at this point.

I think you are way too optimistic. We won't see mass adoption in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:48:27
Here is the problem. Without some really great news e.g. futures trading incoming, govt legalized btc was legal tender, there isn't anything for a rally to build on. IMO we're not out of the woods yet and we're more likely to go down than up. Especially give the time of year, New Years. You are hoping for FOMO to goto the ATH again.

No. The entire problem of crypto is they have limited value add (silk road). Solving technical solutions before providing a benefit to users is putting the cart before the horse. It also results in the hype we see today because people overhear other people talking about bitcoin without understanding that this is computer scientists/mathematicians/economists basically doing research/solving proofs rather than creating a real implementable system.
