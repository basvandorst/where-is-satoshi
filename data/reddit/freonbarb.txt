BTC is currently too volatile to have utility as a currency, anyway. Hopefully, its volatility will eventually be minimal as it matures.

I wouldn't do that if I were you. But I'm not you, so carry on and goodluck.

Not really, I'm just admitting a bias that I and probably many others have. When there are two options, but people are only allowed to speak favorably about one of them, it makes me more curious about the other option. Maybe its just my anti-authority streak and others aren't that way, I don't know.

I suggest you reread my original comment.

That makes sense. I just worry about being manipulated. And as someone who owns bitcoin but has admittedly not done enough research to feel confident one way or the other, I'm not really sure what to believe.

If you did research, you had to know that this was a very real risk. It sucks, but I think panic selling would just make things worse. Ride it out.

No, and take the absolute minimum in Uni loans that you possibly can. Apply for every scholarship you can. Trust me, I just finished paying off over $100K in loans and the interest rates will fuck you hard. Way, way too risky.

You misunderstood my post and you're taking what I said out of context in order to construe it as a lie. I saw someone who was banned from this sub for a seemingly innocuous post supporting 2X, and I want to understand why.

Pray tell, what is the *real* price of bitcoin, and when will this tulip bubble pop?

It means he bought bitcoin at $3,500. Probably a good thing considering the current price is ~$4,200.

Depends on whether it keeps going up or not, doesn't it? You could say the same thing about people who bought Apple stock at their all time high of $10 in 2006, but its worth $153 now.

I agree that it seems highly unlikely for the price to continue growing exponentially like it has and I wouldn't be surprised to see it correct into the $2000s. Even though that would be a good buying opportunity, I kinda hope it doesn't.

I heard that you could get banned here for supporting 2X. Is there any truth to that? If so, that concerns me and it cant help but make me look at 2X more favorably.
