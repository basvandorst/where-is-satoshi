Mycelium doesn't support SegWit and have no plan in doing it. You'll end up paying more fees to transact.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:27:55
The best, from experience. It is nicer to see in your wallet that you own 100 000 bits than 0.1 btc. It is also much more practical, our mind is better at handling integers than floats.

Really nice article. It seems like some people spent a lot of energy trying to solve issues and improve Bitcoin while many others are spending their time trying to destroy it. It is unclear why ?
Those defending block size increase don't understand that the next step after segwit would probably be a soft fork to increase the block size and make it dynamic.
Building something takes time, while destroying it is so easy, pro-segwit people should unite and raise their voice the same way anti-segwit do for months.
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:11:18
If you mean the segwit one, segwit is working like that:
Right now each transaction is stored on the block along with its signature.
The idea behind segwit is to store the signature outside of the block. The size needed for each transaction is then reduced by 70% . You can then store a lot more transactions in each block with the same amount of space.
You need those signatures to validate the transactions in the blocks, so you need to saved those signatures. 
The trick is that technically, you don't need to keep all of them. You could, let's say, keep the signatures of the last 500 blocks, and remove the older signatures, freeing a lot of space.
For the older blocks, blocks buried under a lot of newer blocks, you can rely on the hash of the block and don't have to validate each transaction one by one. ( The hash is derived from the transactions in the block. If you change one transaction in the block, the hash changes too ). Blocks being chained, if you want to hack a specific block you need to hack all blocks that are on top of it, which is impossible. This is why you can rely on the block hash.

I created a Dockerfile for those interested to run a full node but doesn't want to bother with building from sources:

No, I set up a full node on a dedicated server, but I'm using bitnodes.21.co on my phone to check its status
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:43:55
For those who want to run a UASF Full node without compromising security, without spending too much time to install it, or for those who simply don't know how to build from source, I created a Dockerfile that compiles the source from  (based on shaolinfry BIP 148 proposal) and runs it.
I'll document it on github when I'll have more time.

Actually this is what happened to 2 of them. They bought in 2013 at 900$ during the bubble. They hated me for 3 years but they kept their bitcoins, they never sold and  now they are very thankful.

No need to modify the uacomment, it is part of the patch.  
User agent will be /Satoshi:0.14.0/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)/  
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:40:30
Yes it is around 5-7 days old.
This branch takes the last 0.14.0 bitcoin core sources and only add the UASF patch on it (around 15 lines of code).
@_date: 2017-04-11 05:20:55
Beware, instead of    
git clone 
```  
You must run :   
git clone --branch 0.14-BIP148  
Otherwise it would compile the regular bitcoin node, not a UASF node
@_date: 2017-04-14 21:30:13
Just to prevent confusion, the name of the branch that contains the UASF patch is 0.14-BIP148
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:27:38
It's ready, I just added (and tested) a Dockerfile named "Dockerfile-prune-mode" that runs bitcoind in pruned mode.  The documentation is updated.  It was just a command-line argument to add. I've set it to 550Mo (the minimum).

Great overall experience with xapo also,    
their mobile app is nice,    
you can check your last payment instantly,.  
never had any issue with them,   
It worked everywhere I've used it in France,
 Ireland, Portugal, online,    
they seems quite stable, I sometimes leave bitcoins on it for months without problems

Guys, if you want to run an UASF node now, check the Dockerfile I wrote here:
It takes only 10 minutes to install a node

Pruning should be relatively easy.  I'll check that and update you hopefully today. 
For the raspberry, I just ordered one, as I didn't have one. I need to test installation on it. I'll update you on that too but it will take me more time.

Man, SegWit + 8mb sounds nice but even with only 1mb + SegWit + LN it will be huge.
LN is very  powerful

This Ver vs Core thing is a common issue.  
Ver is kind of a marketing guy. I'm a developer and in each company that I worked for there was a perpetual conflict between the marketing and the devs.  
Marketing guys tend to think that the devs work for them, that they should lead the company and take the important decisions.  Meanwhile devs are generally ununderstood people, that just want to do their work the best they can, and are generally only trying to solve issues as objectively as possible.

Status Quo is an illusion, as you would just end up giving power to Jihan. If a majority supports BIP 148 there will be no split and everything will go smooth.
I don't understand people saying they don't want changes. First the network is saturated. Then we need to send a clear message to Jihan, Roger and co that we as the users still own Bitcoin and will not let someone take control over it now or in the future.
BIP 148 could be compared to a referendum against tyranny. Not taking position is like saying I'm not voting.

I can understand that core developers don't want to mess with politic, but being under attack and doing nothing is non logical, especially when the solution (bip148) exists and is supported by 80-90% of the ecosystem.
