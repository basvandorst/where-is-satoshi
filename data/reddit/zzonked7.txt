At the moment they are still quietly trialing Distributed Ledger Technology in different ways in the UK. 
I ran into a company testing distributing benefits by their budgeting app that uses DLTs. They're sponsored by the DWP.
The UK Government is on board with the technology, so I think that's more of an endorsement. Theresa May is a sitting duck she'll be gone in the next couple of years. I wouldn't take anything she says too seriously.

Man, I was trying to register to sell when it was at 20k. I was planning on selling maybe £4k worth with the intention of buying back buying back in when it dipped. 
The backlog cost me a free 2k lmao.

If you don't have any yet sure why not. Just buy an amount you can afford.

No one can answer that with absolute certainty. People predicted a 10k high by xmas that was doubled mid December.
Personally if I didn't have any I would probably just buy right now. Look at it as a long term investment. The price might drop more in the short term, but it's likely to increase again. A year from now I would be very surprised if it is still this low. 
Even if it dips a little bit more you're still getting in after a big dip from this months price.

Based on post history he's probably some Russian shill.

People just spamming to try and lower the price even more.

How do you guys see the buy/sell walls?

Is that separate to the general 11k tax free I get on my normal salary?

We can only celebrate when bitcoin supplants USD and no longer is compared.

-5. use bitcoin to buy quaaludes on dark net markets.

Anything anyone says is just a guess. It's impossible to predict short term price to a high level of accuracy. 
Basically the way I'm looking at it is that a year from now it will likely go higher than it is right now.

Don't keep it on coinbase, move it to a personal wallet. It doesn't have to be on the same PC. 
Electrum seems like a good one.
I use a hardware wallet but cost me like £80 so probably not worth you getting one if it's only £100 you're buying.

So basically what you're saying is magic numbers inside my computer will definitely make me rich because of magic?

I bought a single BTC a few months ago for about £100. I know just one is probably small time for you guys, but it's got me super excited to see it go up this much, I'm just a poor student. Gonna keep hold of it and see where this ride takes me, although it's kind of tempting to cash out and buy some food haha. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:38:34
I bought at around $200 and then a little extra just now because of this crash. I'm just gonna sit tight for maybe a year or two. If bitcoin takes off then maybe I will have made a bit of money, if not, oh well.
