So gdax/Coinbase didn’t assign a fee to the transfer. Will this ever get confirmed or can I cancel it?

Will small business (or businesses in general) need a bitcoin strategy? **"Not in our lifetime"**
"Small business have to worry about producing and selling a product, keeping the door open, and cleaning up at the end of the day" - **does this guy still think its the 1950's?**
Business is “one person selling to one person” - **this is the core of digital currency's value**
"People confuse bitcoin with bitchain" - **Give me a break**
**"The Bloomberg platform is a blockchain but instead of having the users control it, we control it but it has all the attributes of that (blockchain)" - This right here clearly shows he has no idea what a decentralized blockchain even is in the slightest bit**
... and last but not least 
**"Theres no volume"**

Hadn’t transferred bitcoin in a while. This is horrible for the network and yet Coinbase doesn’t want to upgrade to segwit while not assigning fees to their transfers

Is this going to add a new tradable asset along with Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin ?

And it's BTC that's getting the upgrade not BCH ?

Wouldn't the apps that run on bitcoins blockchain need the liquidity?
