@_date: 2018-01-11 18:31:38
Thanks, would you buy from one of these?
From the listed UK vendors the only one i found is selling a nano s for £150-£199.

Can i throw different another idea out there? What about donating money to somthing like this? 
Much respect to what you are doing, i don't think i would be able to give so much away if i were in your shoes. I applaud you.

5-7 years ago it was totally possible. I remember mining on my dads crappy old computer.
Now days you have companies that have warehouses FILLED with hardware to mine for BTC 24/7 365d/y.
Back when it first started to kick off people had no idea how much they would be worth.
There are many stories about people loosing/selling hundreds even thousands of coins, that would now be worth millions.
Honestly go do some research on bitcoin its fascinating.

I'm unsure of this terminology, would you explain? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:12:48
Can you recommend the best safest ways to purchase BTC from the UK?
Also are there any tips you can share with someone that has never purchased crypto before?

I can't buy somthing I don't know enough about.
I don't know what to do after I've bought some, how to transfer it over to a hardware wallet etc.
All these things you in detail but I don't. 
Amy helpful information would be appreciated 
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:35:58
Ahh Thanks for the more detailed response its clarified a lot! :)

Surprising enough I've just found out about him a few days ago from a guy called Louis Thomas on YouTube. 
Louis has some great content too if you want to check it out

hmm will this affect the price of btc?

Hi 
So i will accept your offer of answering more of my questions if you wouldn't mind! :)
So i think i am going to start the cost averaging as you suggested this week.
I use android and was going to download Breadwallet.
I have looked online and i can only find outdated videos about buying bitcoin. Can you briefly explain how i would go about buying bitcoin if i wanted them today? I've heard coinbase is sketchy (account closures etc.) 
Is the Breadcoin app used for the sole purpose of storing my bitcoin? I cannot buy coins there?
Also another question i had that i cannot find clear answers for is: Just as an example 1 BTC is worth £1000. I decide to buy £250 worth of bitcoin. I will then own .25 BTC.
In the future i invest a further £750 and now i own the £1000 worth of bitcoin. So now i own a full coin?
How does this work? Do these two transactions merge together to form one coin? Or will i seperately own 0.25 and 0.75??
This is really confusing me and i feel as though i have not explained it very well.
Hope you can help.

Wow thanks :) I've had a quick look at the newcomers threat you added in the past but I'll have a more thorough read.
A question I have is mainly how should I get involved? I've heard coinbase is a good place to start?
Two months ago I actually put money aside to invest and now looking at the increase its a bit of a kick in the teeth. Eh hindsight aye, live and learn!
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:40:36
Thanks a lot for the reply once again! You are very helpful.
Hopefully i can jump in while there is a price dip.

Thanks are those wallets online ? Or an app? I've also heard of physical wallets are these what you mean by appropriate backup?
You are right I want to invest.
If you was like me with 0 invested but knowing the information you do know, would you think it's a good idea to start investing? 
Also I very much appreciate your help its very informative. :)

Wasn't it 10,000?
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:26:18
Worth it ��
