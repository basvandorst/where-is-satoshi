Thank you for your time!

Tbh, I have not used it yet. Though, I would recommend that you make a video demonstration and/or introduction when you first visit the page. As for the website layout, make the site more coffee themed. Brown-*ish*(instead of the out of place yellow), whole background picture of coffee beans, etc.. You get the idea. I know it's not much, but I'm pleased to see new establishments that have a 'reward' for used bitcoins in a purchase. Hope to see this succeed.

Production quality is necessary for watchability(lack of a better word). For example, look how Dropbox first started their service, when they made their short introductory video their user base had an evident increase. Make it look professional, and be creative as well. If you have the capital, hire an animator to make a short, clean, and concise video explaining what your service offers. Finally, know your target audience. Though, I guess that is for you to decide what that means exactly. It is a good step forward with taking these suggestions, good work and keep it up.
Edit: A word, Better example

I'm not a economic expert, but we need more practical uses for Bitcoin. "It has potential.". Explain. How can something have potential, yet never have the ability to show it. My 2c is that It can have it's primary use within the internet, since it shows it's shine the most here. I can see it being used within the context of agreement with the ideas and fine arts. Someone shows a work of art or an idea, tip them. Although as simple as it may sound, I do not think that I would put a national currency in this place.
