If I remember correctly it's a decently long password. Brute forcing mlid probably not viable. I have been reading up on pkcrack trying to find the right combination of plaintect to use to break the zip encryption.  Also trying to put together a generator of passwords that I may have made it. And using that for a dictionary attack.

Nice! I recently bought a Best buy gift card to buy a switch. Loving Mario odyssey. Still need to pick up BotW

Yeah I have found ready made tools to help. Trying to find the right plain text to use. The wallet is encrypted as well. And was made using what believe was the last version of bitcoin-Qt. So maybe I need to rebuild that as I don't think they have the binaries anymore.

Nice! I haven't trying to remember my password to a encrypted zip with a backup of my wallet from 2014. No luck so far.
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:59:40
pretty sure most of the Nokia Lumias have them as well. I know my 920 did and so does my 925. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 17:37:52
i know right thats the plan. just think about the password at all times.  maybe it will pop into my head. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 02:12:20
And here I am trying to brute force a zip file I encrypted with my old wallet from around 2014. Only if I could remember the password. Im pretty sure it has around 1.1 BTC on it. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 17:04:54
Heres the steps I have taken so far. 
1. guess the password 
2. wrote a script to  generate unique passwords based on  parts that I normally use(dictionary attack)
3. brute forcing the password just takes to long because im pretty sure its a at least 15 chars in length. 
4. with the zip plain text attack you need one of files in the archive to be used which I dont have any of.
I haven't looked into purchasing any software yet. Not sure how much that is going to help. but im trying haha I was out of the bitcoin game for too long.

What was the best way to get those off I currently have a mycelium wallet with BTC from before the fork.
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:25:30
I remember using what is now the bitcoin core. I dont think it was called bitcoin core when I created the backups I am going to see if I can find an old version of that to test some backup files.

It wasn't that I tried to force to take BTC or I wasn't paying them. One of them was going to but beer and I did not have any cash. And I couldn't do chase quick pay. So I offered to send them BTC instead to show then how it works. I ended up up sending the amount to another friend who was interested and he covered the cash I owed. Not that it really matters in our group of friend it wad a miniscule amount of money (&lt;$10 ).

Ahh I have exact story. I used to go to the casino all the time playing slots. Then i got into poker and learned just how bad casino games actually are. For now I'm playing blackjack because I don't have the bankroll to support my poker. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:00:55
I know this is true for me. I had a total of 3 BTC at the most and ending up spending 2 of then on concert tickets and gambling. I want to spend the other 1 I have left because I would love to support the companies that offer it as a payment. but I might just keep this 1 as an investment. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:23:03
That  makes sense, thanks a lot! 
edit: grammar. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:36:51
I try to get my friends to accept bitcoin when I owe them money. I owed my friend $5 dollars and offered to send them .005BTC for it but they won't take it. I ended up just giving one of my friends around .005 I had lying around in a old wallet. Im not gonna go through the hassle if they don't care to learn what it is.

Ahh okay thanks here take 1 internet.+1 internet verify

well I only invested $30 back in March and I only have one coin left. I think it's going to be hard to sell going to try localbitcoins so I don't have to deal with online exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:14:26
+$1 My first tip this Bot is so cool. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:11:21
Every time Bitcoin pops up in conversation with my friends I tell them the price and they keep telling me to sell. When I first bought Bitcoin back in March I thought it would be a investment that I could turn around. But the more I read about Bitcoin and the more research I do, I believe in the Protocol and it while the road my be bumpy I think Bitcoin can do good. I am not selling and don't plan on selling even though I could make a ~3000% profit on my initial investment. Fail or Succeed I'm in it for the long run.

you can actually turn this setting off. I have a friend with a Xbox One and he has it set on power saver mode so when you turn the console off its completely off and not listening for you to say Xbox turn on. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:20:18
thanks! I figured it was something around that but was not sure of the steps completely.

Almost every app I have on my iPod have crashed at least once or twice.

ahh thats pretty cool. I did not know that! thats pretty cool! 
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:44:08
wait you can tip coffee now?
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:34:03
Was going to try that. Where do you play if you do? I used to play micro stakes online. But being in the US made it a bitch to cash out. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:59:44
I think you only need the verify in certain subs. I got a message saying the tip went through. 
Lets try again

I hate how most American news networks use "terrorism" as a means to get things done. Oh he said terrorism better ban everything.

yeah didn't catch that I was on my phone when I posted it. I probably accidentally hit caps button and didn't notice.

I bet like .1 bitcoins at SD as they were the first bitcoins I had and I wanted to see how it worked with transactions and things. How does SD actually work though?
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:02:35
i think this was it. thanks do you have anyidea when they will be taking orders again.

Probably the coolest thing I learned in my discrete math class is the halting problem. And here's an application.
