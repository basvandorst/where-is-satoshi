You can make small builds that you can transport easily.
Buying a laptop just to have it constantly plugged is an expensive compromise.

1) My Poker 2 isn't thick.
2) Mechanical keyboards are much more durable than cheap regular keyboards.  Again, Poker 2 has a solid, thick base and an aluminium plate on the inside.
3) Poker 2 is designed exactly for being put in a bag and transported around
4) If he's not staying somewhere permanently, I'm sure he can put up with 720p for a couple of hours.

Students can make compromises.  Especially if it means saving a ton of money.

If they're just visiting somewhere, they can make do for a couple of hours.
I get the feeling I'm talking to a lot of spoiled people.
I mean, you can get a 90 dollar 1080p monitor for wherever you spend most of your time.  If the place you're visiting for a couple of hours doesn't have one and you have to make do with an older TV, make do ffs.
First world problems.

And you'll still be wasting hundreds of your preferred currency.

Wouldn't be able to have games with them?
Have you heard of Steam?
EDIT: Apparently people haven't heard of Steam, either that or they're not aware that it allows exactly what the previous comment was asking for.

You're really not grasping the conversation.  Well, maybe you are, but you're selectively ignoring important parts of it.
Good evening.
TIL 'slight premium' = hundreds of dollars!

I don't, in that case the student should get a cheap and cheerful £400 laptop which is more than capable of running word and whatever else needed for academic work, and save the rest of the £600+ to build a small desktop machine that will be just as powerful as the 'Gaming Laptop' that they wasted money on in the first place.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:24:58
Yes, even then.
Besides, 'Gaming Laptop' is not much more than marketing term.  They're actually 'massive chunks of computer that you have to keep stationary because they have extremely short battery life.' - I guess 'gaming laptop' is a more marketable term.
At which point you'd have been better off with a desktop, at which point you've massively overpaid.

Yea, fuck off now.
I have never once suggested taking a monitor and a desktop into the classroom and you know it.

60% keyboards can fit in a small bag, you don't need to take a monitor around with you unless you go to a lot of places that have no tvs.

Yes, you can get a decent 1080p monitor for 90 dollars.  1080p monitors have been around for years, as long as you don't want one with a pivot stand, you can get a decent one for that easily.
We're talking about students here who need to be a bit careful with their money.
First world problems because you're visiting someone for a couple of hours / days who doesn't have a nice shiny 1080p monitor? Absolutely.
No wonder this place ends up in subredditdrama so often.  Geez.
