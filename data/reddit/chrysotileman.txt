Hey, 
I'm based in the UK but will post abroad the font is just what I liked and the frames are only this colour for now to offer the product cheap :).

More or less.

This sub is 1 million strong (I've posted this on other subs too)  that's $40 million a month in volume at $10 a week which is 12121.21 bitcoins a month off the market to hold.

Hey nothing like that.
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:27:08
Not really. Institutions and teams are easily tracked everyday people not so much.
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:58:33
If you're buying $40 a month you aren't gonna make that much difference if you sell. 
The weak hands and greed will get bought up and once we get more institutions and media attention it won't be a problem.

One persons actions will not turn the market we need to band together in unison as a community as corny as that sounds.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:00:11
I totally agree.
@_date: 2019-09-01 11:09:53
Definitely, it's always good to have a nice story come out of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:34:06
Yeah, I now buy and store NEXO on their platform to gain interest but I'm happy to see BlockFi has finally taken notice of the smaller players in the game.
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:31:18
I posted this piece on the UK Reddit page too thought they'd be interest, I was wrong.
They're still holding hate for crypto and bitcoin and think the story is made up.
You can't believe some people who are stuck in there old fashioned ways.
