Is there anywhere where you can buy btc without providing your entire life history? Every where I have tried so far wants a photo copy of my ID, a photo of me holding a piece of paper... I thought one of the draws of crytocurrency was anonymity?! Good Grief!

Where would someone go for advice on using bitcoin as an investment. I'm looking for unbiased information. Keep in mind that I am new to any kind of investing - typical blue collar worker living day to day on a self-employed, non-guaranteed income.

So those funds are just tied up, potentially, forever? No damn wonder I've never used bitcoin before. Is there anything I can do to cancel it? What would a good fee % be? I just assumed that Electrum would select the best amount automatically. That's what I get for assuming, huh?

That sucks! So you're supposed to pay someone more to transfer your money than you actually pay? That's like me going to Walmart and purchasing $20 in merchandise, but I'm going to pay PayPal $25 to give Walmart my $20!?!?! &lt;rolling eyes&gt;
Anyway... Electrum is confusing me. That transaction no longer shows in my [History] tab, and the status bar no longer shows "xxxxx amount pending". The amount shown in the [Balance] status is the amount I had prior to trying to send this. However, if I go to the [Send] tab, under [Invoices] that transaction shows up with a status of [√ Paid]. iOffer, the site I was trying to pay still shows I have a balance. 
I appreciate your help.

Nope... I exited Electrum and restarted it and yep... still says low fee.

Anyone ever told you that you are not very nice!? :)
I read that (about the 72 hours) but it's been five days now. That's why I thought I'd ask. 
If I ever do this again, what should I use as a fee to avoid this?

Are you serious!? I hope you are kidding again.
