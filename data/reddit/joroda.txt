They would've had an easier time banning automobiles in favor of the horse and carriage.  There can be no victory against blockchain technology.

The cancerous wretches can't die off quickly enough... Here's hoping that the ultra elites create an anti-boomer pathogen.

OLED plus a high res makes that look pretty impressive.  I'm waiting until battery life improves.

Boomers enjoyed an unprecedented economic advantage due to the post WWII status of the Anglosphere as the only manufacturing base not devastated by war. After the decades of recovery for war torn nations, those advantages slowly diminished. The ease of success largely prevented the boomers from maturing in a practical way, yielding to all sorts of social and economic maladies with seemingly no repercussions and therefore no reason to change. What they didn't understand is that their children and grandchildren must pay a heavy price. It is no folly when the young, who did not have such advantages and did not have a say, begin to point out these facts. The boomers never had to grow up but their kids had better do so and fast.

Millenials should play video games and watch the whole rotten carcass burn.  A "regular job" these days is blatant servitude that in many cases is still not a living of any kind.  There's no point.

It is deflationary, which in this case means only 21 million can ever exist.  This means that they can't just keep printing more and diluting the value of each unit.  It will fluctuate but unlike fiat it wouldn't keep dropping.

It was created to address the fact that our present fiat money system is essentially a scam.  You should be able to save a dollar and it should have the same value in 10 year's time, but instead we have  dilution of that dollar's value because it's not really backed by anything.  The scammers can just "print" infinite amounts for their own scammy needs and we all have to pay the price.  Why shouldn't it have the same purchasing power in 10 years?  The labor you exerted to earn it did not change, did it?  So basically it's just a giant daily ripoff, like a tax. 
The blockchain is about TRUST.  Period.  You can't trust people, but you CAN trust technology.
