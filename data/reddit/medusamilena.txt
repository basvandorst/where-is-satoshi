**Then I would suggest that you have taken the wrong lesson from MojoNation or have bought into some sort of vision about how what the world really needs is a p2p digital cash system.**.. (I know that we did at one point.) Inflation really had nothing to do with the problem, and if that is the lesson you take away from our experience you might end up repeating our mistakes.
You might want to check out the essay written by Bryce Wilcox-O'Hearn (aka zooko), one of our key coders at the time, that you can find at  for more info on the structural &amp; implementation problems we encountered and how this turned the micropayment system into a development distraction rather than a useful feature.
Eiither way, good luck.

Thanks for the link! And yes, I have bought into the vision that the world desperately needs a p2p cash system. Without one, e-commerce will remain a major PITA.**

But but, it's in Xapo colours.

Well it's a little of both, of course you prepay with bitcoins, but not prepay the credit card (MyChoice). When you use the card MyChoice sends the payment to Xapo who then sells the bitcoins you own. If you would check the card balance at an ATM or so it will always show zero.
