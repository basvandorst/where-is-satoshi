SpaceX is a fascinating success story. As it improves, I have no doubt NASA will move further and further away from using Russian launch systems for anything.

10 BTC is enough to buy a model 3 today.

The only reason I can think of to sell is that most merchants don't accept BTC (yet), so if you need to purchase something you can't use BTC for, you'll need to convert it to dollars.
Or if you bought 1,000 BTC when they were $10 a piece and you feel like retiring very early.

Good lord, you spout nothing but Russian propaganda about the West, and you tell me *I've* fallen for "mainstream media propaganda?"
Get back to me when your economy is larger than a U.S. state's, your grocery stores are always fully stocked in every city, and you don't have to bribe an oligarch to get anything done.
You know what? We do have problems, and we're **aware** of those problems. But you sitting there pretending **your** problems don't exist isn't helping the Russian people. 3.5% of your population is homeless, compared to 0.5% in the United States. 0.5% is too high, of course. It should be 0%. But you can get the hell off your high horse and stop pretending that a country with a dying oil industry as its only major export and an oligarchy that robs its people blind is somehow better. Stand up and fucking **do something** for your people.


I should get a GoPro just so I can show you my daily bicycle commute through my beautiful, well-maintained, spacious, and happy city. I'll make sure to linger on the absolute worst areas during the ride, so you can see how even the shittiest parts of a small American city look.

Hey, you're the one who called the West "rundown." [Here's downtown Saint Petersburg]( and [here's downtown New York]( Mind you, I love Saint Petersburg architecture, but you tell me which looks more "rundown" and unmaintained.
You guys deserve a break from the shit Putin and the oligarchs put you through.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:27:47
This deserves another, more detailed response.
I think Russia is a beautiful country. I think its history is fascinating, its architecture is gorgeous, and its people amazing. I also think - and the evidence backs me up, here - that your country has suffered under one oppressive regime after another, regimes that often make it harder for people who live there just to make ends meet.
You called Western states "rundown." Your country's GDP is smaller than California's, you have buildings that have been undergoing construction for the better part of a decade, there are roads in major cities that are falling apart, and you have an oligarchy that prevents anything from getting done without bribes. I can open YouTube and spend literally all day watching bored and hopeless Russian youths risk their lives (or actually die) making unsafe climbs on buildings, because they don't have anything better to do and they have no prospects. And in those videos, I'll see shitty tenements and decay fucking *everywhere*.
You say I should come visit Russia and see what it's like in person. I'd *love* to. I love travel. But you should do the same. Come to the States, and see both big and small-town life here. You'll find there are good places and bad places, sure. But the good will far outweigh the bad. And maybe you'll think twice about calling Western states "rundown" afterwards.

I've got a bit in alt coins (ETH and LTC, mostly), but I'm pretty sure it's going to be Bitcoin that takes off the most. That said, ethereum has some really interesting technology that might make me eat my words in the long run (hence diversification).
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:44:14
Western rundown states? Have you *seen* what Russia is like today? Unless you live in an oligarch's favorite part of his favorite town, it's a shithole. The only thing they have to export of value is oil, and it's not like the people of Russia see any benefits from that.

Yes, you'll owe capital gains tax. Selling BTC is a taxable event. But if you've been holding since 2013, that will be a remarkable profit.
I'm not a CPA so don't use this as tax advice, but here's how I understand it. You'll owe ~15% on the **profit**. To simplify, let's say you spent $100 on some amount of bitcoin, and now it's worth $1000. Your **profit** is $900 ($1000 earned from the sale minus the cost of the initial purchase). 15% of $900 is $135. Note that this doesn't include the fees you pay for the cash-out. So say it cost you $10 to cash out. You still owe 15% on the full $900, even if you only get $890.
So your total take will be $1000 - ($135 + $10) for a total take-home of $855. Not bad for an initial investment of $100.

I'm buying as fast as I can now, but I'm a latecomer. My current goal is just to get to a single Bitcoin, then see where it's at. My big regret is that when I first heard about Bitcoin, I could have mined hundreds from a regular PC, then forgotten about them, but I never got around to it.

Maybe because without the pizza shop, all you've got is a bunch of emails you're taking out of context?
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:46:46
There was no human trafficking in a pizza parlor. You do know a guy showed up and shot the place up looking for the basement full of kids, don't you? And discovered that it doesn't fucking *have* a basement?
Literally hundreds of people pass through Comet Pingpong Pizza every day. It's hard to imagine a *worse* place for keeping a trafficking operation than a publicly accessible pizza parlor.
Keep that shit in The_Dumbass where it belongs.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:49:53
Can you imagine the thought process? "I know! Let's run our slavery and human trafficking ring through a publicly accessible restaurant that has hundreds - if not thousands - of patrons every day! Nothing could possibly go wrong! Muahahahahah!"
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:48:49


Yes. Criminal elements. Let me know when there's any evidence that Clinton, Podesta, or anyone else targeted by the pizzagate whackjobs are those criminal elements. I swear, you're coming off just as nutty as the 9/11 truthers and David Icke's lizard people believers.


Not at all. Is it so hard for *you* to accept that you need actual evidence, not out-of-context email snippets, to prove something?


The pizza shop is **central** to the conspiracy theory. If the pizza shop isn't playing host to a child sex ring, then the whole theory falls apart. And it's not. The conspiracy theory's core component - the physical location where children are supposedly kept as slaves - is false. Give it up. Get a life.

Oh my god, they've still got that silly thing going? Insane.

Not... not the handkerchief babies! Oh, the humanity!

No, it's really not. And the Soros bogeyman isn't going to steal all our btc and eth.
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:26:56
You. You're flogging the pizzagate conspiracy theory nonsense. It didn't happen. I could take literally anyone's emails, and if I squint at them funny and pick out my favorite words, I could make an argument that a bunch of the messages are code for human trafficking, too. It's pure bullshit, and belongs on conspiracy or The_Dingus. There isn't any evidence, not a single shred.
