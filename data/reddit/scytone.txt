[Here]( is a link to a thread discussing pooled mining where Satoshi is responding and providing feedback on the topic. Satoshi was aware of this and did discuss it.
[here]( Satoshi is discussing the idea leading up to ASICs. 
[Here] ( as well as [here]( Satoshi talks about big players in mining, as the consequences, and how smaller users would likely be responding. Including non mining nodes, just transaction nodes.
That covers the first 5 points. Your last two points I can't speak to, and I will agree Satoshi shouldn't be seen as the end all be all word of god.
But just in case you're maliciously spreading FUD, I have to call you out on some bullshit.

I think that’s it’s fair to say there’s issues with both that need further investigation. I just have read a lot about PoS that lead me to believe it would make more sense on a second layer. Like with lightning. 
I have trouble wrapping my head around using the currency to directly get more of the currency. It seems... fragile I guess? For that kind of circularity to exist.

Lightning network
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:05:32
Isn’t there game theory related issues with PoS? staking the currency you use to get more of the same currency. Without a real world requirement for entry I feel like there could be issues with proper valuation. 
Plus requiring coins to get coins causes an entirely different economic dynamic. 
I don’t think there is clear superiority.

I am of the opinion that one shouldn’t use btc for regular transactions if one holds the same outlook as you do. It’s just not ready for that kind of adoption and forcing an update out the door so it can be used right now is a bad idea. 
Again just my opinion. But we (btc community) don’t get too many shots and getting something like this right. And bitcoin has so much momentum right now that it will pay off more than ever to not have a colossal fuck up that we regret down the road. 
Bitcoin can continue to change the world but only if it’s done correctly. To make sure it’s correct, it takes time. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:05:36
That’s fine also. I think that even if bitcoin loses mainstream adoption now, it will be able to continue working towards its goal and likely come back when it’s more developed. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:11:16
Reckless increase is bad. There’s nothing inherently wrong with a bigger block. It’s specifically using bigger blocks as a scaling solution alone that is problematic. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:11:53
That’s totally fine. Proper solutions take time. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:38:10
Yeah it’s partly why it’s shut down. LN is the next opportunity for it to return. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:09:37
While I disagree with his approach, I don’t think the high fees are a *fundamental* problem. There is a solution and it’s being worked towards. We know what the solution looks like and how well it should work. We just need it to be completely QC’d 
people complaining about high fees are more of a problem than the actual fees because the complains spread unnecessary FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:57:12
This needs to be higher. Following satoshi because he is satoshi is dangerous centralization. 
We need to reach consensus as a community and allow forks to occur until the best solution wins out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:21:34
"fall sharply" to a spot above what it was last night. lol, all this FUD
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:52:51
Blockchain allows it to be done automatically and trustlessly. You don’t need any middle man to manage any of it. Including who gives the power and when. Additionally it could all be fairly anonymous if we wanted it to be. 
None of this is possible prior to blockchain and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:51:25
How is flooding exchanges not going to be impacted by lightning. If the exchange is moving bitcoin around constantly, it would make more sense to take as much of that off chain as possible. At best, lightning resolves all of the issues with time and fees, including exchanges. 
At worst, it resolves the issues with time and fees outside of exchanges.
It sounds to me like Lightning network can only help insofar as were concerned with speed and fees. Therefore, I think, as far as fees and speed is concerned, its worth implementing. Especially since it does NOT have any of the negative impacts that something like bigger blocks provides. That is a completely different argument though that isn't relevant to LN integration
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:59:43
So develop it yourself. There is no centralized bitcoin core dev hub. It's anyone who wants to write for it.
These projects will be ready when they are ready. If bitcoin drops in value because of that, so be it. Bitcoin is a long term project, it's not going anywhere. You're welcome to leave, but if you value decentralization and security, I'd stick with bitcoin and utilize other coins for your immediate needs.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:01:27
I didn’t say disallowing future blocksize increases. I said perpetual block size increases. Because continuously increasing the block size should not be the solution to scalability. SegWit is good for a lot of reasons, that’s one of the big ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:22:30
These are quickly thought up possibilities, not realized use cases for bitcoin. I hold bitcoin for what it’s capable of, not just what it has done now. 
Also you may have misunderstood my solar panel example. Homeowners do have the solar panels. And can still pay whoever to maintain or install them. But rather then selling to the grid you could imagine selling to your neighbors. Bitcoin doesn’t solve all world problems. It doesn’t invent infrastructure. But it makes possible a few things that never were possible before it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:56:22
I don't think this is a good idea. Bitcoin doesn't *NEED* to be a solve-all solution right now. There are coins like Litecoin that are much better at transactions now. Convert to Litecoin and transact that way. Bitcoin is not ready to be a medium of active exchange, and I don't see that as a problem. It's not going anywhere, if the value dips because of that, that's fine.
Bitcoin will be ready when it is ready. Careful, slow, and decentralized development should remain the standard. That is the best long term course of development IMO. Even if that means losing value in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:46:31
No. That you’re basing your opinion off of an appeal to emotion and not thinking about the reprocussions. 
Your focus is on immediate startling issues rather than recognizing that they are solvable in an efficient way that takes time. 
You are appealing to emotion by stirring up FUD in order to rattle some of the less certain individuals in the Bitcoin scene. 
If you were not doing this, we would be having a conversation about block size or transactions in a technical sense rather than a political one. But you aren’t acting that way. So here we are, talking about FUD instead.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:06:07
You sort of just proved his point my friend. Enjoy your shilling. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:25:18
I don’t want to overly glorify something that’s not currently there, so take this with a grain of salt. But the technology underlying bitcoin is incredibly powerful, especially when paired with transactions. 
If you treat bitcoin like a currency, equivalent to fiat but simply digital, you’re missing out on all of the opportunities surrounding off chain processing and smart contracts and just trust less exchange in general.
Bitcoin enables less reliance on trusted third parties, and things like smart contracts enable it for anyone who wants to implement it. 
Think planned communities with solar panels, who all inhabitants in real time are selling and buying power to one another through micro transactions across a block chain. We could manage power distribution in a free market manner without a centralized power company. This means no worry of being screwed by a power company monopoly. 
Or look at atomic swaps, or lightning network transactions. We could have a completely decentralized exchange, removing the need for something like coinbase (with the exception of transferring into fiat). This means no worry of exchanges being hacked causing you to lose all of your coins in a freak accident. 
Another implementation could be a decentralized internet, which means everyone hosting their own information, and getting access to files based on their hash from peers. This means something like net neutrality is not just trusted to be implemented, but is guaranteed, or at least ALMOST guaranteed. (Pair with Elon Musk’s interest in satellite internet and it’s even closer to a guarantee) 
There’s a looming shadow over centralized institution that can never go away: how much can we trust a mediating third party? The technology underlying bitcoin enables us to have our cake and eat it too. We can enjoy benefits that up until now required a third party we “trusted” (Comcast, the fed reserve, Bank of America), only now *we don’t need the third party* 
Take all of that, and also make it global. That is an incredible piece of technology. It’s not JUST bitcoin. But bitcoin is one of the only coins that is developed without a centralized decision source. A sweeping majority of alts have a single entity deciding the direction of the coin. But bitcoin lost its creator. When satoshi disappeared, development of bitcoin became headed by the majority belief, not a single decider. People write code for it. And if peer reviewers like the code, they can implement it. Development of bitcoin is decentralized and nearly completely trust less as well. 
That is why bitcoin is incredibly unique and valuable, in my opinion. Because of its potential and it’s lack of a single headed entity. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:00:30
Because people in history have relevant opinions. Including satoshi. That’s kind of an extreme leap to make from what I was saying, don’t you think?
With that said. There’s plenty of people in history where we disregard their opinions as incorrect, even if they were a great person in other areas. 
I’m against idolization of someone like satoshi because it promotes blind followership. Which is a bad thing.  This is not the same thing as “disregard satoshi because he was wrong about one or two things.” I think that’s just as ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:53:23
That’s not how lightning works. Read the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:25:56
That’s beside the point and You’re dismissing the issue. There’s value in trust less exchange of services, it just so happens that our society is riddled with services that, with advancement in cryptography and blockchain, can be automated with middle men removed. 
Not to mention you’ve latched on to a single one of my imaginary future examples and are extrapolating it to all potential use cases. That’s not very responsible. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:09:40
Bitcoin won’t die. If you want bigger blocks or some other solution outside of the smart, slow approach. Just fork it yourself. 
There literally is no rush to perfect this project. There is no deadline. If you just want to get Rich, then yeah the long term approach risks missing out on higher pricing sooner. 
But bitcoin isn’t about getting rich. It’s about revolutionizing currency. That takes time. If you’d like to discuss this more in depth, I’ll have this conversation. But you’re going to have to explain what’s so idiotic instead of just ad Hoc calling it idiotic. 
Not to mention bitcoin is still riding a huge % increase in value relative to fiat. I can’t even fathom where you’d ever get the idea that it’s slowly dying when it has 10x’d in one year time. That’s unbelievable growth. So even if you DO want to use it just to get Rich, it still has been one of the most profitable investments of our time. Any speculation on where the price is headed now is just that: speculation. Don’t act like you see the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:15:29
I think you’re missing my interest in a decentralized and independent system. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:16:11
Shilling too hard on Christmas, my dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:02:12
The answer depends on who you ask. One big one for me is decentralized development. No one person holds significant power over bitcoin. I don’t believe any other coins have that to the same degree as bitcoin. 
Both of the coins you listed are ran by singular entities. They decide the direction of the coin. That’s not decentralized enough for what I believe bitcoin and blockchain is capable of. 
This doesn’t mean those coins and companies *cant* develop in the right direction, whatever that may be, but it does mean there’s more room for corruption. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:54:12
What is a decentralized bank
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:09:42
You can do this on Gemini too can’t you? 
Also Gemini is SegWit ready
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:23:16
There are figure heads in the crypto scene that still misrepresent bitcoin. The direction and potential of bitcoin is still wildly untapped and unknown. We know what it can do now but most people still don’t have an idea as to what that exactly implies. 
People treating it like a currency are only scratching the surface. Bitcoin is mostly emergent at this point, which is kind of one of its strongest traits. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:08:02
This is misleading though because it doesn’t increase the block size for the same reasons that big blockers (see BCH) want an increase.
It’s a different philosophy entirely. A minor block size increase to disallow a need for perpetual block size increases. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:14:07
I think the system will be both better and preferable because it removes any opportunity for corruption while still supplying, at least, the same utility. If not more. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:06:49
Because I can’t do that to every person that misrepresents these techs on reddit. It’s too much work. 
Instead check out discussions on lightning network and scalability by people like:
Jimmy Song 
Tone Vays
Andreas Antonopoulos
Elizabeth Stark 
Richard Heart
Nick Szabo
Second layer integration is widely discussed and advocated for by people more qualified to explain it than I am. Go look to them, they will tell you exactly why the OP is incorrect about lightning
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:47:50
Why is that? I think satoshi has valuable opinions. But if the opinions in question aren’t relevant today, we shouldn’t consider them...
Just because Satoshi creates bitcoin doesn’t mean Satoshi has all the right answers. Bitcoin should not have a figurehead that people look to for answers. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:50:01
I think you’re trying too hard to see why it won’t fit in our current system. 
I know this won’t work now and there are better options now. 
But in a world tha has adopted block chain, this kind of use case makes way more sense. The kind of example I set up calls for home batteries and full blockchain integration with common every day items. 
Of course it doesn’t make sense now. It’s not about what we can do now. It’s about what we can do in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:28:57
Yeah. I didn’t explain. I cited resources for you to learn from professionals. 
Go do that
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:10:55
Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t know enough about that relationship and the actual numbers to say anything substantial. But conceptually, bitcoin has been carefully and slowly developed enough to support implementing some kind of resolution for whatever problem might arise there. And if not, fork the coin and go from there. 
Bitcoin has such a strong foundation that I’m not really worried about surface level problems like that. Maybe I should be though! I’m not sure. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:14:21
I’m not sure what you mean by “secure it in the meantime.” Is it currently insecure? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:18:10
Lightning is that solution by dude. Standard support -&gt; segregated witness support is a much bigger jump than segwit -&gt; lightning support. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:28:16
That automated system is being built by everyone. See: bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:49:40
It doesn’t need to grow fast. Bitcoin doesn’t need get *anywhere* fast. If the goal is to have a working network for exchange ASAP, bitcoin shouldn’t be the go-to coin. Bitcoin should be the coin that takes its time doing things the most secure and solid way it can. 
And that’s what it’s doing. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:46:49
I think that’s what segwit and lightning development is trying to Remedy. Just needs time. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:02:11
The bank fee exists because there is no automation. So i'm not so sure he was talking about the bank fee.
