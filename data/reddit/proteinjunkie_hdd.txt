You guys definitely overestimate your influence on Europe.

Ahhhh...Always entertaining when people try to get into a field of business they have no expertise in and think they can get rich quick.

Get yourself a cold storage wallet then...

I know but if you transfer your coins to your wallet (like you should ) then your argument about „qAuLiTy SeRviCe“ is invalid.

I'm assuming the faceless is the green box with numbers in it...I gave a try and decoded it but it really doesn't make sense to me.

As an absolute noob, it took me quite some time to solve this (before it was posted) so I'm willing to give a headstart for people who are noobs like me

Etiquette of the internet ?
You must be new here...
Everyone wants information fast, efficient and with zero self effort delivered to them.

Isn’t that the whole point of this bull market and what we‘ve learned of the December 2017 that this unhealthy rapid growth is not good?
Slow and steady up to the moon. We got all the time in the world.

BTC definitiv richtige Entscheidung.
Wenn du es wirklich einfach haben willst, imvestiere deine 100€ auf Bitpanda (FinTech StartUp mit Sitz in Wien).
Fees (also Gebühren) sind da natürlich etwas höher) aber du kannst auch mit Kreditkarte/Sofortüberweisung etc. bezahlen ( da kommen auch nochmal ca. 2% Fees oben drauf.
Die langfristige Lösung ist es definitiv nicht ( da die Fees einfach zu hoch sind) aber für das erste kleine ( und auch du wirst vom Crypto Fieber gepackt werden und mehr investieren) Investment wird’s reichen.
Ich empfehle Bitpanda deshalb weil es super übersichtlich ist ( hübsches Layout, einfache Grafiken) und Betrugsrisiko gering.
Viel Erfolg!

Absolutely. Consider it as a Purchase for something you might use in a few years but is at the moment unusable. The money is gone for now.
Like an old car that needs some work but once it’s fixed and running you might sell it with a huge profit.

Deep Breaths!

 Coinbase Pro ( ehemals GDAX).
25ct Einzahlungsgebühr für die Überweisung und zwischen 0.05-0.25% (!) für Trades ( ab 100k wirds nochmal billiger)
Fürs Traden optimal aber für ein Investment solltest du sowieso ein Cold Storage (Offline) Wallet besorgen. Weil Sicherheit.

Thank you! 
Invested in February. Can’t wait for the sleepless nights

You asked them anything about Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:30:52
I don’t really see that today. These spikes lately were always followed by a dip.
My guess is that we will go back to €8.900 or something like that and will stay there for the next few days/weeks.
But I’m more than happy to be proven wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:17:27
What are you talking about ?
Yesterday we had one oft the most profitable days in a long time,
There is no negative trend. Just reached a new support level. 
If THAT is already too much for you ( even thou there is absolutely nothing to be worried about) than stay away from Crypto.

So, do you even know what “Break Even” means ?
