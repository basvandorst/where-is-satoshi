Sure everyone knows a bad ui when they see one - it frustrates the hell out of them, not many people recognise an amazing ui as  the experience is seamless and faultless, they transact and move on.
Speaking of bad ui - binance and bittrex are appalling

Stopped using BTC some time ago for ETH. Would be nice to see Segwit properly implemented though

Fiat currency is inflationary. The government will tell you that inflation is only 2-3% - actually they manipulate the criteria to measure inflation so that the result is about 2-3%. If you measure inflation against thr same criteria over many many years you'll see it's much mich higher.

Very sad for you bro - money is just money. Focus on being a great human and kind partner to your girlfriend. Fortune will turn back to in your favour soon

Ha ha this is so wrong, user centric design is not "one of the most difficult things in software development" - all you need is a decent team of designers and a good product manager.
The crypto space is mainly led by engineers and developers (like Google and android) which leads to bad user interfaces.
Trust me it's Easy to design a website - the security and hosting behind a website like Coinbase is a whole different ball game.

Solid advice. Always take out your initial investment. It always helps when there are major swings - you feel like you haven’t lost any of your own money

Portfolios for a lot of people today will be all GREEN - prepare for the Leonardo Di Caprio Memes congratulating people who "weathered the storm" or "bought the dip"

Some say you can get your seed engraved on piece of metal (so it won’t burn or get destroyed) then Store a copy in a safe and another copy somewhere else like Fort Knox

Ha this is similar to my story. Used to buy lottery tickets just to get even the slightest chance of making extra money - even just winning a small prize!! But now with crypto I can actual see wealth coming next year!

I never understood a sell wall. Is that where someone had a sell order in for 700btc and now your saying that it got cancelled or something?

Did you do user research before attaching this? Did you find a gap in the market? Not trolling just keen to know. This is a very competitive/cluttered space
