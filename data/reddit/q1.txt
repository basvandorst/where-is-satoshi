wait, the subject would have to be about "the ball", you don't own houses or any other assets. your kid relationship with the other is strictly about ball-play. also, this was not about any kind of insurance, but keeping money (the ball) with a bank (another kid).
consider the flip though, if the other kid loses your ball, you have to create another ball out of your (empty) pocket for the other kid to have a ball to rent to you.
also, if you want to talk insurance, the way insurance works is - you pay for literally another house, in case you burn your house down -- or in case you don't burn it, [the insurer gets to keep your house money, according to the contract]( you pay for a bank to keep some risk-factor calculated monthly chunk of your money to give back to you in case something happens, without exceeding the sum which you already put in the account. these are your life savings.

no, I don't think the rpcuser setting can be duplicated, but you could certainly use the rpcuser/pass already in place. there could be a problem if you tried using p2pool + armory at the same time, please check to see if there is a conflict.
in case there is a conflict, the only option might be using bitcoin-qt with p2pool, and only starting armory when p2pool+bitcoin-qt are turned off.

I think he used a VM, because one can easily set a max percentage of the machine's CPU time to be used.
edit: also, probably a Nehalem CPU if he was into Intel, or, less likely, Athlon stuff if he liked AMD. I think Nehalem had a better chance to mine 7Mhps than the AMD part, I still have an AMD from that time period (specifically, bought in May 2008) and it turns around 2Mhps.

No, it's not killing itself, it is being helped to kill itself; and no, it's not by design, KnC and ASIC manufacturers were not included in Satoshi's paper.

I'm trying to tell you this is a highly volatile asset and that you might have just timed your buys poorly, not knowing the market you're positioning yourself into.
Either way, you bought your coin at ever lower prices, which is objectively better than buying your coin at ever higher prices. You basically bought the exact same asset, cheaper and cheaper. There's merit to that.

I don't trust banks to add legitimacy to anything, they got away with fraud more often than anyone. This is practically why Bitcoin exists, right?
If you don't have the private keys, you don't hold Bitcoin, you're just keeping some IOUs that the banks made up. The banks could use the capital to invest into anything other than Bitcoin, effectively taking your money to make a bet against you, and you'll be left with the impression that you have bought Bitcoin and then Bitcoin failed, when you actually failed to put your money into actual Bitcoin.

BCash should have no claim to the original software name because they are a copy and modification of the original Bitcoin, simple as that.
 - to put it simply, if it is listed here, then it is not the original Bitcoin.
 - this is the original Bitcoin project repository. If the source of your node software uses a different repository than this one, then it is not the original Bitcoin implementation, and subsequently, the software needs to bear a different name.

Well, I'll try to explain this methodically, step-by-step: Bitcoin is defined by its running principles, which are translated into algorithms and code by developers (1), which (written) code is then accepted (or not) into real-world practice by the final users. Based on the consensus of the users upon the principles delineated by the code that they run, the Bitcoin software network is put into existence. In this way, the Bitcoin users govern the network.
