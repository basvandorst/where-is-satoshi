This power to move markets doesn’t flow from a centralized authority but rather a decentralized fear that they will have the authority going forward. No way to control that. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:00:21
Yes, it does. Yes, they have the power to move markets with their words. But they do **not** have the **authority** to do so, in the same sense that the fed has the authority to control the market through rates. 
They cannot be stripped of an authority that they do not have. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:39:07
The point is that anyone into crypto should fundamentally understand that you can’t control something that’s decentralized. The thing moving the market is people’s personal fear of regulations - you can’t regulate that fear away and good luck trying to convince every market participant not to be afraid of it. You’re just spinning your wheels if you think there’s any solution here. They don’t have the power you want them not to have, but that’s irrelevant because that’s not the power that’s moving the market.

It’s because one of the primary causes of hyperinflation is printing money to support a war effort. We’ve already got by far the strongest military in the world, like it’s not even close. Imagine we get into a war with another country that drags on for years. The other country is going to have to resort to printing money long before the US ever needs to consider it, and that’s pretty much a death spiral for their economy. 
Therefore there is a direct correlation between the strength of a country’s military and the stability of it’s currency. Which makes more countries willing to accept it, hold it, use it, etc.

If someone is deemed a high risk for a public safety hazard, they’re kept in detention and denied bail. There is no need to blast their name out in public to keep people safe when they’re locked up.
If you mean while they’re still on the run, a picture will do, and it should be used very very judiciously.
Think about how you would feel if it happened to you. It’s injustice on the highest level. You might think it couldn’t happen to you unless you’re actually a serial killer, but that’s the whole point. There’s nothing worse than the state perpetrating crimes against innocent citizens in the name of the greater good. That’s a really really really slippery slope. It starts with this and continues on to torture and genocide.

One thing that’s still not clear to me is who pays to open the channel. The way I understand it - say it takes 1 BTC to open a channel to a peer. If that peer has channels open to other peers, payments can route from peer to peer. The endgame here is something like the World Wide Web of payments. 
So that means that the max that first party can ever send through their channel is 1 BTC + whatever they have received over the channel, correct? So when the channel is closed, it settles such that each side of the channel has the correct balance. 
But who is fronting that 1 BTC to lock into the channel? Entirely one party? Or is it 50/50 both sides?

It really isn't bullshit. We know the cells themselves are fine being frozen and thawed when done properly. It's still not 100% clear if the freezing/thawing process maintains neuronal structure, nor has anyone figured out how to reboot a brain, or cure ALS for that matter...but these are probably all solvable problems. As long as the initial freezing process didn't irreversibly damage brain tissue, he'll probably rise from the dead at some point in the future. 
It could be centuries from now, but as long as he stays on ice, he's got a chance.

Log scale on top, rate of change on bottom. 
The bubbles in 2014 were WAY BIGGER. Like off the charts ridiculous. The last month is just slightly above average growth, it just feels so much bigger because the absolute numbers are bigger. It’s purely psychological though - by the numbers the rate of growth in the bubbles was far more in 2014, we’re talking like 100K by Christmas kind of growth.

The part you’re missing is when it comes to a corporation, who holds the keys? For a large organization, it can’t be a single person within that organization. No one would even want that responsibility. The only thing shareholders would go for is third party, likely insured, custody through a firm specializing in crypto custody. 
Even when you’re operating a small business with an LLC, by definition it’s not “your” coins to begin with, it’s the LLC’s coins. If creditors were to come after those coins and you refused to give them up, you could even be charged with criminal theft. 
As an individual not your keys not your coins makes sense. For businesses it’s already by definition not any individual’s  coins. Stuff like this is required to move forward.

So in a sense it’s like locking it up and exchanging for an lightning token that’s pegged to the value of BTC? And in that sense your ability to use the lightning network is proportional to the amount of that token you own? And eventually you can close the channel and cash in however much lightning token you have for BTC?
Ok, something else I don’t understand - say Alice funds 1 BTC to open a channel to Bob. Carol sends Alice 1 BTC through lightning, which hops through Bob to get to her. Alice’s balance in the channel is now 2 BTC. If Alice closes the channel, she gets the first BTC back. But the second BTC was locked up by Carol, and she has no intent of closing her channel. How does Alice get the second BTC on chain? 
Or can Alice only ever receive at maximum the amount she funded the channel with? So she would have to send .5 BTC to someone else before she could receive .5 BTC from Bob or Carol or whoever?

I’m from the US, but I have always thought that taxing crypto spends should be similar to how the mileage and home office deduction work - you can calculate the exact capital gains/losses if you want, but there should be a simplified flat rate if you don’t.

Monero was private from day one and it was never optional. That makes it distinctly different from anything bitcoin can ever do with privacy. 
It also has the least centralized mining out of any mineable currency by far, and is dedicated to staying that way. The development is also noticeably more decentralized than just about everything but bitcoin. 
Of course there are associated tradeoffs, but it addresses two of the biggest issues with bitcoin and thus it has a reason to exist alongside it. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:23:27

It's priced in to a degree. The closer we get to that day, the more it gets priced in. 
What's going to be really interesting this time around is the effect of the futures market. I'm not sure if it's going to make it more or less volatile, but one of the best use cases for the futures market is miners using it to make their income more predictable. That's not going to work if their income is going to literally drop by half at a single moment that everyone can see coming....unless the futures start to push that effect further back into the past. 
It remains my firm belief that the price to mine per BTC is the strongest price support level there is, and prices can not plausibly drop far below that level for a long period of time. The way I see it, the closer the price of BTC is to the marginal cost to mine, the bigger the effect of the halvening. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:58:25
Can this can that. Typical reality tends to be otherwise. If you’re losing 10% of your revenue to fraud you’re in a real fucked up business.

@_date: 2018-08-22 22:05:11
I don’t expect the day itself to be significant outside of an emotional reaction, because the only reasonable way for a miner to react is to price in the expected lower income months in advance and treat it statistically. 
If anything we may see a significant increase in hashrate prior, as people race to get in before the block reward drops. With hashrate rising and increasing the security of the network at the same time as the inflation level cuts in half, the only way the price can go is up. 
If the cost of mining truly is a price floor, we should see the price rising in anticipation of the higher floor the closer we get. There simply has never been a sustained period of time where profitability is so low that a large number of miners are unprofitable. Not to say it can’t happen, but there are strong reasons to believe it shouldn’t. But at this point bitcoin mining is so industrialized that it would be highly unusual to build a large business that you expect to shut down on a specific date. 
I was around for the last halvening and it was pretty much a complete non-event.

Honestly, my solution is to be a crypto based company that doesn’t accept crypto until software catches up. I can’t even use bitpay yet because I don’t have a website.

As long as accounting requires immediate conversion to fiat (and paying a payment processor to do so) it saves businesses nothing.

To be able to sync a BTC/BCH/ETH/LTC address into an account and or a coinbase/exchange account in quickbooks, natively in crypto. Then for it to handle double entry bookkeeping by automatically converting to dollar value at the time of transaction. Extra kudos for tracking cost basis and capital gains/losses on a running basis, accounting for 50+ transactions in and out of 5+ wallets a day down to the satoshi. 
The basic framework to do this already exists with multi-currency support, so its really more of a synchronization problem more than anything else, and its possibly to write quickbooks plugins. But rounding to two decimal places is a complete and total non-starter.
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:36:56
If I define it that way I can’t use any of the multi-currency functionality. It’s the kind of thing that could work if I absolutely positively **needed** to accurately account for every millibit. It’s still way, way easier to just not accept crypto. 
It’s funny, before I owned my own business I was always like “why don’t more businesses accept crypto? It’s so easy!”  
Now I know why. 
Intuit doesn’t really care about supporting this properly as far as I can tell. They supposedly supported invoicing in BTC through coinbase, but coinbase has since retired their merchant tools that integration relies on. And Intuit didn’t even bother disabling the function or updating the documentation.

Because the whole point of accounting software is that it does all this stuff for me and it allows me to understand the financial status of my business without needing an accounting degree. I don't have knowledge in VBA/API, I'm just a guy who runs a business that wants to use crypto. Bitcoin.tax or cointracking.info solves the tax problem at the end of the year, but doesn't do much to keep my books straight during the year. If I have to do a manual export every day I'm already wasting more time and energy on this then I could ever hope to recoup financially by accepting crypto directly. 
I need the bitcoin equivalent of quickbooks. Emphasis on quick. I just want to accept crypto without needing a CPA. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:16:44
If there was another full fledged accounting software with native support for crypto geared towards small businesses, I’d be all over it. But on balance QuickBooks works very well for every other aspect of my business, so if it came down to dropping QuickBooks or not accepting crypto, I’d rather not accept crypto. 
I don’t think the property treatment is unfair per se. I don’t have a problem with it with my brokerage account, because it handles all the calculations for you. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:30:51
That attitude is unnecessary. I am sure a full time accountant can make this work. I am using quickbooks because I'm not and don't want to be an accountant. Everything that I need to do with dollars is simple, as soon as a single satoshi gets involved the entire workflow of the software breaks down. At that point it is literally easier for me not to accept crypto than to hack some workaround.

I had this glorious situation with bitpay on Newegg the other day. 
I buy something and try to pay with BTC through BRD. For whatever reason BRD doesn’t recognize the bitpay BTC address. 
I say fuck this, throw the exact same shit in a cart again, and check out with BCH using BRD, and it works just fine. 
5 minutes later I get an email saying I reached my qty limit on one of the items - it was max 1, and because the old BTC order was still pending it thought I was trying to double order. So it was just going to send the other items. At this point I had a BTC order in limbo that I couldn’t pay due to technical wallet issues, and half an order was being sent to m, and Newegg still had $2K+ of my bitcoin cash. 
I call them and explain it, and the first CSR was utterly confused by the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash. I eventually get it escalated, and I finally manage to cancel the bitcoin order. 
I explain everything to the supervisor, how they still have 2K of my bitcoin cash. 
CSR: you will get a refund for it. 
Me: In what currency?
CSR: Bitcoin. 
Me: But I paid in Bitcoin Cash. 
CSR: Hold on let me double check. Ok, nevermind, you’ll get the refund in dollars.
Me: Yeah, but how much? I didn’t pay in dollars.
CSR: As much cash as the bitcoin is worth. 
Me: You mean bitcoin cash? 
CSR: Yes, you’ll get it in a gift card in dollars within the next 48 hours, you can spend it like cash. 
Me: No, I mean I paid in bitcoin cash.
CSR: That’s correct sir, you’ll get cash for your bitcoin. 
Me: No, I mean how much of a refund am I getting? Bitcoin cash will be worth something very different in 48hrs, if it goes down I won’t even be able to purchase the thing you won’t let me purchase right now. 
CSR: You’ll get based on what the Bitcoin is worth right now. 
Me: ....you mean what Bitcoin Cash is worth, right? I just want to be crystal clear on this. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are not the same thing. 
CSR: Yes, it’ll be like Bitcoin Cash.
Me: ....thanks kbye
At that point I just hung up the phone, crossed my fingers and hoped I got enough of a refund to buy the thing. Next day it comes in and it was exactly to the cent of what it cost to buy it, so at least they got that part right. But holy shit you guys, if someone who’s paid to understand this can’t even distinguish between them, what do you think it’ll be like for average joe?
I personally still believe one side is going to buckle and rebrand before they run each other into the ground. I actually like bitcoin cash now, I use it way more than bitcoin. I just really, really wish it was named something else. Or they can call BTC Oldcoin or whatever for all I give a shit.

People overestimate what can be accomplished in the short term and underestimate what can be accomplished in the long term. 
This is because people generally look at the current pace of progress based on today’s technology and extrapolate that forward. It’s rarely effective. Short term people are poor at accounting for unexpected roadblocks (like near term advances not coming together as fast as expected). Long term people are poor at accounting for unexpected accelerants (like technology that didn’t exist or was inconceivable at the time of the prediction.)
For as many predictions from 1900 that didn’t come through by 2000, there were 100 incredible advances in technology that the people in 1900 couldn’t even conceive of.

I think the part that triggered everyone (at least what triggered me) was that by trying to push their payment protocol before it was standard, they fragmented the market. This created difficulties for people wanting to pay through wallets which didn’t support it (and most didn’t), and also created the perception (fair or unfair) that they were trying to monopolize bitcoin payments by breaking compatibility with most wallets.  It was the antithesis of the open source ethos and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that it would be poorly received by a community like this.
A lesser concern is that there’s probably a contingent of people that just don’t like bitpay because they’re primarily seen as a way for merchants to accept bitcoin without actually joining the bitcoin economy (by automatically converting to fiat.)

You’ll do it once and realize it’s nothing more than a novelty. Existing in person payment systems are simply better for consumers. BTC has little to nothing to offer, you basically give up all your consumer protections and there is zero upside. 
For internet based transactions there is at least a little upside in that you can make transactions without having to give up a credit card number that can be charged over and over without your permission, leaked etc.

Even amongst countries that have “cheap” electricity there’s still a spectrum. So the tendency will be for hardware to migrate from more expensive electricity to cheaper electricity. Don’t get me wrong, it puts all miners in a tough spot, but whenever mining profitability has been pinched in the past, it never resulting in a collapse in hash rate and a resulting deterioration of BTC’s data integrity. Mining businesses come and go, but the hardware never stops hashing.

You’re doing this all wrong. Here is the correct way to backup a hardware wallet:
Take the 12/24 word split it in three equal sets, A, B, C. 
Take three cards. Write two sets on each card - AB, BC, AC. 
Keep the three cards in different places. Put one in a safe deposit box, keep one at work, with someone trusted etc. 
If anyone discovers one card, it’s useless without one of the others. 
If one of the cards is destroyed, you can always recreate the card/wallet from the other two.

There is no amount of computer power that is too little. It will always get exactly the amount of computing power that it can justify through its present and speculative future valuation. 
Long before it gets to zero you will have people speculating on its future value being higher, and speculatively putting that computing power to work even if it’s present value can’t justify it. As if there was ever a direct way to measure that anyway. 
If a reduction in hash rate would lead to a death spiral than it never would have gotten off the ground. 
The amount of computing power does not have to go down over time. It can and likely will reach an equilibrium point where the marginal profit to mining is razor thin, just like any mature industry. That equilibrium point can obviously rise and fall, but there is not a plausible scenario where it becomes a death spiral - the counter forces only get stronger and stronger the further it goes down. Eventually fear causes it to undershoot a reasonable valuation and the buying pressure from opportunists causes it to break the other way. 
Your hypothesis is reasonable but the data we already have has already effectively proved it wrong. To the extent “big money” hasn’t had the opportunity to short, they equally haven’t had an opportunity to buy either. It’s always been the case the within it’s sphere, there have been roughly equivalent opportunity to buy and to short. And every single time, anyone who thought they were going to short bitcoin out of existence were the ones that got destroyed. Hash rate and security didn’t go down at any scale whenever there were significant price drops. The best proof that your scenario won’t happen is that it hasn’t already happened. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:13:52
What I don't follow is how you recognize there's a relationship between hash/security and market value, and yet deny it has any value whatsoever. That would lead me to believe that you understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin is the security/integrity of the data on the blockchain....but for whatever reason you haven't connected the dots there.

Or you just pay a little to pool risk with an insurance policy to take the edge off of catastrophic events, like humans have been doing for hundreds of years.

You’re missing one critical thing in your analysis - when mining income gets tight, the price of electricity is the single biggest factor between success and failure. When those with more expensive electricity are forced out, any equipment they liquidate is snapped up by their competitors with cheaper electricity. Hash rate is key to BTC security, and hash rate has not gone down in response to price, even though it is definitively unprofitable to mine in many places right now. Furthermore as more miners are forced out and more ASICs forced onto the secondary market, it reduces the up front cost for investing into ASICs, thereby reducing time to ROI if the market recovers for the secondary investor, which increases the odds someone is willing to take a chance on them. 
In other words, your analysis is based on a reduction of bitcoins functionality and security due to reduction in mining capacity, and the data does not bear that out. Hash hasn’t and will likely never goes down unless it’s not profitable for *anyone* to mine - and even in times when that might occur, the same financial instruments you want to short with can also be used by miners to hedge against that scenario. That keeps the lights on and the ASICs humming away. And even in the worst worst case scenario, the ASICs just lie dormant for a time. 
The only way your strategy really works is if BTC pretty much death spirals to zero and never recovers, and all I can say to that is what do you possibly think can happen to kill it that hasn’t already happened? 
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:19:38
From a very, very high level...sure. But remember we're dealing with whats probably the most volatile market in the history of the world. That window of profitability widens and narrows as the price fluctuates. Given that it's a known risk of the business, any sufficiently large scale business will be able to weather the storm for a while. 
To be honest I don't fully understand what "play" your OP is talking about, but in either case, mining profitability is still a self correcting system - if it ever were to happen that miners would start going offline, that would then reduce the cost to mine a bitcoin within 2 weeks and reset the equilibrium.

If that's the real answer to this question, than a purely decentralized bitcoin economy is simply a non-starter.

It’s absolutely my fault for choosing to use a means of exchange with no recourse for a large transaction. I can’t blame bitcoin for being exactly what it was supposed to be, but I’ll also never use it again for those exact same reasons. Being willing to pay a little to hedge against catastrophic loss is business 101, if there’s no capacity for BTC to handle this essential function of business then it’s simply not as suitable for these transactions as everyone thinks it is.

I can guarantee you bitcoin will never get to zero, because I’ll buy all of it if it ever gets to $1. 
It is unlikely that a single miner will ever have 80% of the hash, because such a condition would continually devalue the currency to the point where that entity will eventually find more profit mining something else themselves, which reduces the hash rate, which brings other miners back in. Or they’d just put themselves out of business entirely and their ASICs would be liquidated and redistributed. Or even more likely, every other stakeholder in bitcoin chooses to fork away to a different PoW that makes those ASICs worthless. You should note that for anyone that’s held BTC for at least a year, they technically also own BCH, BTG (which already has alternate PoW) and a ton of other forks that would rise in value as BTC fell. To completely devalue bitcoin you’d have to devalue all previous and future forks as well. Self correcting. Bitcoin is like a Hydra, try and chop off the head and two will grow back in its place. 
Bitcoin has built its brand on working for 9 years straight without being hacked (exchanges are not bitcoin) and on remaining stubbornly resistant to centralization despite every attempt to seize control of it, and on surviving just about every kind of attack and calamity possible and coming out stronger on the other end. 
I had a feeling you were one of those “no tangible value” people - if you can’t see the value in a trustless immutable ledger and the things that such a technology enables, and how a bitcoin is a share of that value due to the fixed supply then there’s not really anything else I can say to convince you.

What I have more effectively said is that the vast majority of people can not make educated decisions, will not understand this system as deep as the average crypto nerd, and are not going to be ok with using a system thats such a minefield of risk. And that is a systemic problem for BTC that does not get enough attention. And I stand by that 100%. If I'm used to this stuff for years and I'm still uncomfortable with it, what hope is there for mass adoption? It's like linux nerds hoping that the world is going to learn a whole new OS that requires the command line constantly to save a few bucks on an OS license. I'm hoping BTC doesn't end up the same way with everyone hoping that this year is finally the year it goes mainstream, because like Linux, it never did. That "people need to be more educated" attitude is going to drive everyone towards the first company that makes the BTC equivalent of Android, and strips out most of what made the core open source product unique in the process.

Sure, that's basically the point I'm making here. It seems to me that by the time we make the sacrifices and pay the costs required to have a robust enough system that its actually viable for consumer transactions at a national/global scale, we're just recreating the system we already have. 
I deal with people getting the items I ship to them stolen off the porch all the time. Not a single time out of dozens has paypal made that my problem, even when they go as far as to do a chargeback through their CC/Bank. I show them a validated tracking number, and I get to keep my money. I don't care whether the other side gets reimbursed or not, that's not my problem. As much as I hate to compliment paypal, I'm getting what I pay for. It just seems more and more obvious to me over time that these arent things that consumers and merchants are ever going to be willing to do without.

And further to that point, there are risks here that don’t exist with cash. There’s no way for cash to disappear into a mathematical black hole because you handed it over incorrectly. There’s no way for someone to hack your mind and trick you into handing it to someone else. There’s little to no opportunity for impersonation when you’re dealing face to face. There’s no way for someone to mask their location when you physically have to be present at that location for the transaction. Etc. BTC is way more in need of fraud protection than cash will ever be, so that’s not a great analogy. The trick that scammer pulled on me could not possibly have been done with cash. 
For BTC to legitimately become the reserve/native currency of the internet, it needs to be suitable for both sides of a transaction on the internet. Right now it’s only a good solution for the recipient. We need to recognize these problems and solve them, not just make false equivalencies to cash or blame the user for making mistakes. Mistakes need to be harder to make in the first place.

I’m a merchant and I’m only ok with it because I’m strongly pro BTC and used to the volatility. But the low fees are barely part of the equation because the volatility means a lot of the time my margin gets destroyed by the value fluctuation within the time it takes to confirm. It also makes accounting a ton harder, refunds a lot more difficult, and brings way more problems to the table than it solves TBH. We’re a very long way from average merchants being willing to tolerate these things, so a payment processor that converts to fiat for a comparable fee to credit card processors is a necessity. So don’t hold to breath for discounts from merchants anytime soon. To the extent they already exist it’s just a marketing tactic.

The difference is that crypto already had a pre-existing internet to coordinate rapid development. The internet itself was comparatively developed mostly isolated in the dark, it is no surprise that it took that long. Crypto has had tons of advantages that email/early internet didn't have, and has developed at a snails pace compared to most other new software technologies introduced since/via the internet. To be fair a ton of that development was derailed into everyone producing their own shitcoin to print money, but I'd like to think we'll get past that soon.

Bitpay and a host of other services are already doing it today. 
But all of those things you listed are things that are much easier AND less risky to do with fiat in every way. There's little advantage for a vendor to accept BTC, and a ton of downsides for a buyer to send BTC. I assure you that this is not going to happen on its own. Awareness is the least of BTC's challenges right now, the drawbacks far outweigh the advantages in most cases. There need to be fundamental improvements in usability first.

Because then we end up where we started with using middlemen like paypal, banks and visa to mediate our transactions. Visa/paypal/banks are fulfilling the same role as escrow and arbitrators, and they're already operating at scale.   
If that's the answer then so be it, but lets give up the facade that it'll ever be a suitable means of exchange for transactions or that it's going to meaningfully "unbank" the world.

Regardless, I hear it over and over that bitcoin makes fractional banking impossible and it simply is not true. The willingness of people to keep their crypto in exchanges demonstrates that many if not most still want custodians to hold their money, and banks can just as easily leverage bitcoin in their custody as they can with dollars. 
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:25:35
I think the 365d average is backwards. People are going to be front-running the halvening, not adjusting to it in retrospect. In my opinion the average should start looking ahead 365 days instead of looking back 365 days in order to model the expected price. In other words we should already be starting to see it's effect, and the current price isn't slightly below the model, it should be significantly below the model.

A quick google search shows that Alipay absolutely has that, and wechat pay and m-pesa require KYC and identity verification to use, which mitigate lots of the risk up front. I also have no doubt that transactions can far more easily be reversed on any of these systems than BTC. There is no equivalency here.

Total nonsense that miners don’t create value, jobs and infrastructure for society. The are *literally* infrastructure that create value and jobs. 
The problem is they don’t create a lot of jobs or extra value local to the farm, the benefit is distributed nationally and worldwide. Also arguably much more beneficial to cities and centers of commerce, which are exactly the opposite places that are conducive to mining. Thus no one wants them in their backyard.
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:46:21

However they do it, the PoS experience needs to be two way:
Stage 1 - I scan QR, NFC, whatever. 
Stage 2 - the PoS system recognizes that I scanned it, and the same amount to be sent is automatically displayed on both. 
Stage 3 - I enter passcode or biometric to confirm scan. 
At no point should anyone ever see an address - the fact that the PoS system recognizes it’s been scanned should be enough confirmation anyone needs that it’s being sent to the right place.

Well said. I don’t have the professional expertise that you do, but my critical thinking hat takes far me enough to know something isn’t right here. 
The part I still can’t wrap my head around is that if the funds are in a bank, does that really satisfy the idea of 1:1 backing? Given that the bank isn’t going to be holding that account 1:1 - if everyone suddenly wanted to withdraw, even if tether has bank accounts worth 2.5B, the banks don’t necessarily have the 2.5B to back that account. Or is that splitting hairs?
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:03:58
I don't have to prove anything - I smell something fishy with the way Tether operates, and this doesn't really change my opinion, so I don't use tether. They're constantly talking out of both sides of their mouth.

Bitcoin can’t fail on technology. Anything so blatantly superior in every way that it could entirely displace BTC like that would become a part of bitcoin long before that happened. As long as the ledger and supply cap is maintained, the underlying tech is irrelevant.

Fun fact: This was clipped from an event where Tim Draper and the overstock.com CEO argued so poorly in defense of BTC that they lost the debate by a huge margin. It was really frustrating to listen to because the questions posed by the moderator and opposition would have been easily handled by someone more informed like AA. Honestly I could have done a better job myself. But Tim Draper in particular actually came off like he didn’t really understand what he was talking about and sounded like the crazy person in the room. To be fair he said it was his first debate and he was clearly up against more experienced debaters, but to whatever extent that debate was heard by people, it probably did BTC adoption a disservice. So really strange to see people quoting from it when it probably would have been better off if it never happened.

@_date: 2017-11-23 02:20:29
They're used as currency in those cases because they have value *outside of a civilized society with a monetary system.* And when you live in a civilized society, it makes a lot more sense to use an abstraction with certain qualities to represent wealth. To do so requires a system, and ultimately the abstraction derives it's intrinsic value from that system.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:10:06
And BTC has all the same useful qualities. That’s the intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:36:52
Or maybe I do understand it perfectly fine, and I'm just assuming everyone else is intelligent enough to understand what I actually mean by saying it's a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:05:31
It's only one of the many properties of bitcoin that give it its intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:52:20
But people do accept it, because they recognize it can effectively serve as a form of money. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:19:10
I hate to burst your bubble, but you're going to have to get used to practical people spoiling the fantasy of eliminating all the middlemen. Most people don't give a shit about taking down the banks or the govt or any middlemen. They just want to get a piece of BTC without having to jump through any hoops, and services like coinbase jump through the hoops for them. 
I'm not going to spend an hour teaching my mom how to set up a full node and a hardware wallet, her eyes would glaze over in five seconds. I can point her towards CB though and it's no more difficult than paypal. BTC as a network is FAR more valuable with the "normies" on board and that's never going to happen without intermediaries like CB. You don't have to use it if you don't want to.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:51:30
I can at least say I went out on a limb a little over year ago. I’d be retired by now if i put a much bigger chunk in - but at least I don’t need to live with the regret that I didn’t take a leap of faith when I had a chance. 
By mid 2017 I started calculating how much longer things had to keep going the way the were before I could have “work is optional” kind of money. I figured 15 months. Seemed crazy to think that was possible at the time, but that was 8 months ago and it hasn’t slowed down - if anything its been the opposite. More than halfway there. If it kept up for 8 months while everyone was crying bubble since day one....surely it can keep up for 7 more.

As long as your house doesn’t burn down, tornado, earthquake, flood, etc. Or someone finds out you have a lot of BTC, then they put a gun to your head and force you to give it up. Or you die in a horrible car accident and your family can’t inherit it because they have no idea where it is. Or you tell someone else just in case you die, and that person or someone they know secretly writes down the key and robs you. Or you and that other person die at the same time. Etc etc. 
Or you could do what 99% of the population in the civilized world do and use a bank or similar custodial service.

I just ordered one. Not sure why lots of people think we need to scale in such a rush or else businesses will never support it when stuff like this exists. Businesses shouldn’t have to explicitly support it. BTC should adapt to work with them. I know middleman is like a dirty word around here but it’s a thousand times more practical in the short-medium term than expecting businesses to directly accept BTC.

TBH I’m not all that ideological about it. I dont think BTC is going to take down “the man” or whatever. Probably just means that the money supply is just one less thing the govt needs to manage. Govt and banks will adapt, those that don’t will be left behind. Like a lot of tech they’ll resist at first but at some point they’ll be forced to get with it if they want to keep up with the rest of the world. 
This is a much more clear and present danger to totalitarian states. But I expect “do you support bitcoin” will become a serious campaign issue at some point and people simply won’t vote for candidates who don’t. It’ll be entrenched in world society before we know it. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:08:21
Gold doesn’t have a finite supply and can’t be securely sent around the world for a few bucks, among other things. So I’d say there’s a substantial qualitative difference there between a worldwide network of value and a rock. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:59:43
At this point it's a unlikely hypothetical. You might as well say Bitcoin is useless if the internet shuts down - you wouldn't be wrong, but there would have to be a world ending apocalypse for that to happen, and then you've got much bigger problems than your Bitcoin disappearing. The chance that Bitcoin miners just up and stop mining one day is so far fetched at this point that it's a practical impossibility. And as someone else mentioned, even in the worst case there are options.

@_date: 2017-11-22 23:45:07
Yeah I remember both quite well. But it’s felt like a bubble for so long at this point that I’m numb to it. 
The difference between BTC and all other bubbles is that there’s nothing to peg BTC to. The housing market had to stall at some point because houses ultimately can’t cost more than people can afford to pay. Dot com stocks were still equity in a business and had to have customers and make money to survive. BTC is just an abstract store of wealth. It can be legitimately worth as much as the world wants it to be. 
Most other cryptos on the other hand. Yeah, that’s not going to end well. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:34:27
I understand perfectly what you're trying to get across, but you're making a philosophical point about what a bitcoin wallet is traditionally supposed to be - when its obvious to everyone but you that I'm making a practical statement about it's functionality.

Nope, it was an epiphany moment when I was trying to buy something listed in BTC, and I had to think way too hard about it and look up an exchange rate just to know how much I was *really* paying. And then it dawned upon me that if even someone like me who’s been following this stuff for years still “thinks in fiat” - the idea that average joe is going to transact in raw BTC anytime soon is a pipe dream. Then I thought it would be real nice if there was some way to automatically convert BTC to dollars at time of payment, realized a debit card that automatically converts would be perfect for that - cause then I could use it everywhere that accepts Visa. 
And then eureka moment - the chain doesn’t have to scale at all because we already have a system for this, and it’s FAR easier to adapt BTC to that system than to reinvent the wheel. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:29:47

That just sounds like wishful thinking to me. 
It relates to the gold market cap because that what the world collectively values a financial instrument that shares similar properties. So 400K/BTC is plausible. 
There is a limit to the amount of cash in the world (without accounting for inflation), mathematically there must be a cap here. Realistically it will not be worth its theoretical maximum.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:39:16
Not at all, that's just something we do to translate it back into the system we're used to. It's kind of like when you first learn a new language, you're still thinking in your native language. It takes a long time before the new language is so natural that you don't need to mentally translate it back to your native language. But BTC is BTC, and USD is USD. We're just used to thinking of things in terms of USD.

So what were the false claims you were going on about then? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:04:28
No one is getting rich at this point who isn’t already wealthy. It’s hard to imagine it going beyond the gold market cap anytime soon. That gives it a cap of 5000% - we’re talking 400K/BTC here. Which is insane and all, but $1000 today will only turn to 50K. It would take a 20K investment today to turn into $1 mil under that very optimistic scenario. 
How many people are really putting 20K on the line right now? Probably not a lot. Quite a few in r/bitcoin I’m sure - but outside of that very few people who aren’t already wealthy have that kind of money to throw around at a risky investment. 
Then again, I remember when $10K/BTC was the moon and now we’re in orbit. $1Mil/BTC sounds as ridiculous to me today as $10K BTC sounded 4 years ago. I’d like to be proven wrong. :)

@_date: 2017-11-22 19:35:54
They don't need to be educated about it to that level of detail. All they need to really understand is that it's a serious thing now. I'm talking about the point where skepticism that it's a serious part of society will make you sound like a fringe lunatic. Right now skepticism is still mainstream.

Decentralization is not either/or, it’s a spectrum. If XLM/XRP is to be considered decentralized then its *barely* so. 
It is doubtful you can find a single organization that actually controls more than a few percent of BTCs currency or hashrate. 
There are some exchanges and pools that aggregate currency/hash on behalf of others. If they were to try and abuse that trust, they would face an immediate exodus from their platform. For example there may be a lot of hashrate aggregated under Chinese mining pools, but if any of those pools were to try and use that hash to do something nefarious, everyone using that pool would rapidly switch to another one. So it is not fair to say that they actually *control* that hashrate. 
Ask yourself this - if a gov were to shut down the ETH or XLM foundation, or the XRP company, or jail all the core devs of any other project, what would happen to the currency? They would be effectively destroyed. They might linger on as a zombie, but it would be a dead end. 
Now ask yourself what would happen to BTC if the BTC foundation were destroyed? Nothing. If the BTC company was destroyed? There isn’t one. If all the core devs were assassinated? Nothing. What if the founder was killed? He’s probably already dead. No one would even know if any of these things even happened, because it would have zero effect on the current and future prospects of BTC. 
That’s what real decentralization looks like.

I strongly disagree with this, given ETHs policy of constant hard forks and BTCs lack thereof. It is plausible that govts could pressure ETH devs to alter issuance, zero out balances, and a whole host of other things that BTC is not vulnerable to because of the inability to get nodes to routinely agree to compatibility breaking hard forks.

It is of secondary importance in the short term. When the majority of the world is using BTC then direct crypto transactions will be more important.

Those examples weren’t eliminating the middlemen, just changing them and their role. Uber, Wordpress and YouTube are the glue that made the idea into a practical reality for most people.

Of course I know that. That’s why I’d like to see someone make a plausible argument for how we get much higher than this while still being mathematically plausible as well.

I am giving people the benefit of the doubt that they understand what I meant when I said that. I'd acknowledge it if we were having a discussion about the merits of storing with a third party vs holding the keys for yourself. All I was saying is that from a functional perspective, it's a wallet.

The math behind it is the *only* thing that matters. People value it because it has proven to be a rock solid system with provable scarcity, and that is 100% due to the underlying cryptography and mathematics. This isn't a mass delusion based on blind faith. It didn't get chosen at random or arbitrarily declared to have value. It earned it's value.

@_date: 2017-11-22 19:27:14
Honestly I think that trivializes it way too much. It's not just that people agreed some random thing has value and is now money. Just like gold the BTC network has properties that enable it to function as money. Its immutable, elemental, divisible, recognizable, rare, transferable - and a dozen other -ables that are all basically requirements for being money. And BTC checks off all of the boxes.
The value in the system is that it can effectively be used as a store of value. It's not just some mass illusion that we all agree on. The consensus is on the intrinsic utility of the system itself.

You can duplicate the coin, but unless you can also duplicate the hilariously huge hashrate of bitcoin that provides the security and backs the system, it’s not the same thing. It still comes back to the math. 
People didn’t just randomly choose gold to believe in. It had particular chemical properties. It never had anything to do with faith in that case either. It earned its place cause it was better money than every other alternative.
People don’t need to actually understand the underlying reason why it has value in order for it to have that value.

People said the same thing last time too. 
Let me spell it out for you. The dot com bubble was temporary. The internet still lived up to the potential in the end. People that stayed invested in tech/internet stocks through the ups and downs won pretty big, even though amazon was like 98% from its ATH at one point. 
People like to point to pets.com as some cautionary tale, but petco.com is doing just fine. The idea wasn’t bad, just early. The problem with dot coms is that they could go out of business. Bitcoin doesn’t go out of business. It’s not a company, it’s an open source protocol. It bubbles and pops and bubbles and pops, but it’s still the same bitcoin and always will be.

You’ve never paid with bitcoin for anything before I take it? I guess the experience is closest to apple pay. There’s no pull out your wallet, insert one of ten card, wait 5 seconds, remove card, click “accept” on touchscreen, put everything back in your wallet etc. It’s simply whip out your phone, scan the code, scan your fingerprint. No reason it couldn’t work with a smartwatch and NFC either. The other main difference is none of your access credentials ever leave your phone, so if Starbucks ever gets hacked, they didn’t have your CC number to begin with. 
That being said I still think retail PoS is profoundly uninteresting and unimportant in the grand scheme of things, people just make a big deal about it because its something down to earth they can understand. Its just another option for payment that'll be completely mundane before long.
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:14:36
Like I said, profoundly uninteresting. 
The way I see it, BTC is the currency of the internet and there's where adoption starts. Once this starts to scale and LN makes micropayments more practical, we'll see all sorts of interesting uses. On the end of all of those interesting uses is someone receiving Bitcoin. More than more people will become part of the Internet economy, which knows no borders. To them, having to exchange their "native currency" for whatever local fiat they need is friction. Any company that doesn't have that friction is more appealing to those people. 
I don't know if you're old enough to remember what it was like before the web was ubiquitous, but there was a time when doing anything with a company over the internet was this amazing and unusual thing. Nowadays people get frustrated when they *can't* do everything they want to do online and have to god forbid give someone a call or actually physically show up at the company's doorstep. At some point people are going to get really annoyed when they *can't* pay with bitcoin or have to go through some archaic fiat exchange. It doesn't hurt a company to get ahead of that early.

Why stop there? I think we should install cameras in every public and private bathroom and put the videos on a public blockchain, so we can all be 100% sure everyone we come in contact with has wiped their ass to our personal exceedingly high standards and thoroughly washed their hands clean. 
On second thought, that’s not good enough - we should have everyone’s food intake under 24/7 surveillance. That way everyone needs to start taking individual responsibility for what they eat, because ultimately that’s where their poop comes from. Because I want to personally be able to opt out of eating in establishments who have ever hired a single employee who has eaten meat just once in their entire life, because it offends me on a personal level. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:04:40
The internet is public but it isn’t censorship resistant though. 
Like someone putting child porn on some server they have to keep very well hidden vs a blockchain that’s copied over thousands of times and distributed alongside legitimate data is a very different thing. 
If YouTube couldn’t stop child porn or porn in general, do you think kids would be watching it, or that it would be so ubiquitous?
What happens when bitcoin opponents start spamming the chain (however costly that might be) with this stuff, and they temporarily turn it into the widest public distribution of child porn to ever exist? How does this go mainstream when it’s public knowledge that a full node is effectively a library of heinous stuff?
This is actually a pretty big deal, and I’m not sure what the answer to it is.

Nice platitude, but it’s not really true. Sending BTC right now is like email forcing you to send in a foreign language that needs to be decoded into your local language before you can make sense of it.
Until it becomes far less volatile you can not do business or even personal transactions without measuring in a more stable unit of account. Even if you don’t exchange it for dollars you still need to think of it in dollars.
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:39:50
Its not a fiat currency and never will be. If you want to compare it to a currency, compare it to gold. 
As much BCH and Nano fanboys want to convince you otherwise, long term store of value is a real use case. And much more important than buying a cup of coffee, because I already have a million ways to do that. Long term, meaning measured in years and not just last week or this year, the amount of value stored in BTC has been increasing significantly over time. By a lot. When the price falls below the 5 year average, then we can start discussing whether or not it's failing as a store of value. Until then it's premature.
Can't say I'm particularly worried, because if you do your research into what makes anything a good money and long term store of value, it has all of those things in spades. I think there's way way way more potential in BTC than just a simple store of value, but SoV is enough on it's own to make it worthwhile. So basically in order for BTC to fail, pretty much the entire world has to fail to understand how BTC has all the required properties of sound money and a whole lot more on top. 
I can't see that happening. What I can see is how people who have little understanding or interest in BTC can fail to understand how it all comes together, and start panic selling something that they never believed in or understood to begin with. When the dust settles and the only people left interested are those who get it, it'll begin it's upward climb again. Fortunately at least 10% of the new guys eventually went on to get it, so I expect the value to continue rising going forward.

A “deflationary” currency works just fine once the inflationary debt bubble gets unwound. By what measure is BTC increasing in price? Against a fiat currency with no upper bound on supply. Take that artificial measure away and it’s just an abstract unit of value. Of course you wouldn’t be quick to spend your BTC before your fiat when you have access to both - why would you spend the thing that’s resilient when the other one is consistently deteriorating? 
Now take the fiat entirely away. “Everyone” is still holding all their BTC and never spending it, right? This reduces the circulating supply to such an extreme that the value in terms of buying power skyrockets, and so do interest rates. It’s the only money left, so what happens, does the world economy just wither away and die? No, silly. People will continue to use money for the things people use money for - food, shelter, whatever. Interest rates would theoretically get so high that no one in their right mind would just let their BTC just sit there when they could be earning 10-15% just lending it out. To the extent that some people don’t spend their bitcoin, they’re enticing everyone else to spend it. Eventually, these two economic forces balance out. 
In other words, once the distorting effects of the unlimited fiat supply are purged from the system, the economy reaches a new equilibrium, and life goes on as normal.

Yes, I am a professional miner. I do this for a living. I’ve built multiple farms 10x+ the size of yours.

You’d probably make more money in the long run if you paid me to help you not make rookie mistakes like this, but I guess this one is a freebie. 
Every ASIC in my many farms have been shut down until they’re profitable to turn on. The GPUs are still going stronger than ever though. 
What you are doing makes no sense, there is zero good reason to burn money like that. There’s nothing to learn from running an ASIC like there is with GPUs.

For now. A block explorer used to be a rare thing too, then they proliferated. If storing images became commonplace, tools to extract those images would become routine as well. Just like it did on newsgroups. Http used to be just text too. People started using it for other stuff, and the software followed. 
Unless this fork completely restricts the ability to insert arbitrary data into the chain, there’s nothing to stop an external piece of software from interpreting it however it wants.
If there are dicks hidden in the chain, they will not stay hidden for long. It’s like a law of nature - if a storage medium can store a representation of a dicks, there will be dicks. This isn’t a new thing - there are cave paintings of dicks.

This is just mental gymnastics. If I told you to go fuck yourself in Chinese, just because you don’t speak Chinese doesn’t mean I didn’t tell you to go fuck yourself. I said what I said, even if you don’t understand it. 
If there’s data on the bitcoin blockchain that can be decoded with a public standard into a big black dick, then there’s effectively a big black dick on the chain even if you choose to deny it and claim it’s just 1s and 0s that you don’t understand.

Yeah unless I’m missing something, until the difficulty changes, they’re still going to have to expend the same average amount of energy as before to find a block. The only thing that’s changed is that the block time slows down by half because there’s half as many miners, but the remaining miners would be twice as likely to actually find a block, so profitability shouldn’t change even though half as many blocks are being produced.

I honestly don’t even know what to say anymore if you still can’t wrap your brain around this very simple concept that correlation is math and the math is unequivocally showing that there was a strong (&gt;.7) correlation there from the perspective of a relevant timescale.

Usage can just as easily bring the price down though, as that increases circulating supply. Ultimately you never get any value from the BTC unless you use it, so hodlers will eventually have to start selling/spending. Perhaps you’re right that they will sell to people who themselves will hodl. It all the depends the ratio between spenders and hodlers, which is probably going to increase. The fact that some of the recipients are new hodlers will only offset it, because right now there is very, very little spending. 
What’s underappreciated IMO is the effect of the halvenings over time....the inflation rate is going to drop dramatically over the next decade. You’re right though that BTC will continue to be lost, and thus at some point it will become net deflationary. It’s unclear whether the amount being created is bigger or smaller than the amount being lost. All we know for sure is that the amount being created will decrease on a fixed schedule and that some indeterminate amount is being lost. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:47:55
Whether or not it’s a coincidence or there’s a causal link is a completely different question as to whether or not it’s correlated. I don’t know why this is so hard for you to understand.

Sure, I'll concede that it wasn't correlated in one direction or another for a full 24 hours. If that's the point you're hanging onto, then sure, you got me on that part.
That doesn't mean it wasn't correlated for many hours during and thereafter the plunge.
You still seem to be missing the point though. Its math. It speaks for itself. It doesn't need to be justified or explained. It just is.

With a private second layer this problem solves itself, as any “tainted” coins that run through the second layer can not reasonably be said to be the same coins coming out of the other side. All BTC can then become “untainted” over time.

@_date: 2017-05-05 20:00:00
Not so much thinking you won't get hacked, but taking reasonable precautions and not going overboard to protect from something that is incredibly unlikely to happen even if you took no precautions at all. Like the chances your neighbors even know what bitcoin is are already low enough, the chances that they're intercepting your wireless signals 24/7, cracking the encryption and then scanning the dumps for private keys is effectively zero. If you're already a target because someone knows you hold a lot of bitcoin then violence is a much more efficient and effective way to extract those keys from you. And you'd have to be a target already anyway, because hacking wireless signals to steal bitcoin keys has such a low probability of coming up with anything that they'd be far better off using the same equipment to just mine it themselves. 
At some point you have to draw a line between  plausible threats and  theoretical but implausible ones. Getting your keys snatched through your printer is well over that line.

Isn't malfunction the most serious threat with a hardware wallet? Ultimately they're still extraordinarily complex machinery. I can't believe anyone would trust a significant amount of wealth to something that's so fragile in the grand scheme of things. I wouldn't bet my bitcoin that if I stuffed one in a safe deposit box that it would still have retained its data 10-20 years from now. 
A piece of paper with at least two QR codes and plaintext keys, sealed in a ziploc and stashed in a safe...I'd wager that even if the paper significantly degraded, the QR code would still be scannable 1000 years from now. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:18:08
I still don't really see the point TBH. Even if you want to spend, why complicate things with a hardware wallet? I wouldn't trust more BTC than I'm willing to lose to an exchange or hardware wallet...so it's a million times easier to just use coinbase on my phone as a wallet. Bitcoin is a terrible medium for spending anyway cause it takes ages to process. I only ever use it when I really don't trust the party on the other end. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:43:03
I personally keep mine in a safe deposit box at a bank. Ask yourself which is more likely:
A - Someone breaks into a bank, breaks into the vault before the cops get there and instead of stealing the cash and running, they go for the heaviest and most difficult thing to steal in that vault. 
Or 
B - Someone breaks into your house, puts a gun to your head and forces you to open the safe and grabs a bunch of paper.

As an outsider at this point I've lost confidence in the bitcoin community's ability to govern itself. Sure it's going to keep growing, but it's also going to continue to lose market share to other cryptos. I don't care which side of the debate you're on, to me it's clear that it's gotten too big to be completely decentralized but also too big to be completely centralized. This situation with transaction times and fees is so ridiculously untenable and there are solutions out there but you guys are paralyzed by infighting and honestly sound like a bunch of little children, not a multi-billion dollar operation. TBH both r/BTC and r/bitcoin are so far up their own asses that they don't seem to realize that squabbling like this is kryptonite to the big money that's needed to take bitcoin to the next level. On some level I'm happy about it because I'm making a fucking killing in altcoins right now and I know that'll continue until you guys get your shit straight. Alts are eating your lunch right now, you don't have years to figure this out. Every day that this is still an issue is a day that bitcoin's future seems in doubt.

The internet isn't a protocol.

There's less distance between where we are now and $1 mil a coin vs $1 and $1000 a coin. 
Consider a few things: Most people have no idea wtf bitcoin is, fewer people know how it works, fewer still can see the possibilities of bitcoin 10 years from now, let alone crypto in general. 
This is both a financial instrument/market and a technology. Technologies are adopted slowly until they suddenly spike in adoption. The price is spiking right now...but adoption is not. It's growing steadily though. And unlike most technologies, because there's a scarce, limited supply, more people adopting it necessarily means those few coins have to rise in value. A lot. Roughly 80% of the bitcoin that will ever exist already does. 
You're still getting in before most people have heard of it, let alone use it or have a need for it. And finally, consider this. One of the primary functions of bitcoin is a deflationary store in value that can't be manipulated by the government. The last recession was in 2008. Bitcoin was on almost no one's mind until 2011. There hasn't been a recession since. In other words, the main event that will ultimately solidify the value of bitcoin in the public eye hasn't even  happened yet...but another recession is inevitable. 
Don't get me wrong, the price will absolutely, unequivocally crash again soon once the hype bubble deflates. And personally I'd diversify beyond BTC. But long term...if you get it now and hold, you're getting in early. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:14:36

@_date: 2017-05-05 17:21:52
I'm only holding bitcoin as a store of value/investment, not spending it on a regular basis. It's just not functional enough for that yet and maybe never will be. If I ever wanted to spend the bitcoin, I'd take a small wallet and sweep it to an exchange and use it from there or convert it to USD. I split my bitcoin amongst dozens of paper wallets so when the time comes to access it, I only need to expose a small amount of it at a time. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:10:44
Here's some perspective:
Bitcoin is just a drop in the bucket right now. 21 trillion would be a dribble. It's hard to imagine $1 mil a coin right now, but there was a time when $10 a coin seemed like a impossible dream. They people buying in at $10 thought they missed the boat. So did people buying in at $100. Now lots of people are kicking themselves for not buying in when it was "only" $1000. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:08:48
Same. Then I wiped my drive and forgot to back up the wallet. It was worth about $80 back then and a hell of a lot more now. 
Makes you wonder how many of those early coins are lost forever. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:06:26
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure there's no way to tell if two public addresses share the same private address. And I'm pretty sure they'd never use the same public address twice. 
OTOH I believe if you had the private key it is possible to validate whether any public address is associated with it. So if authorities somehow got the private keys of the criminals then they could theoretically track the transactions and follow the trail from there, but there are all sorts of techniques to make that trail difficult if not impossible to follow. 
If you're worried that you'll inadvertently end up with dirty money that will get seized by authorities I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. Every dollar in your wallet has probably been used to buy drugs at some point, it's not like innocent people are getting their dollars seized because of something that happened long ago that you had nothing to do with.

Just because it's slow and expensive doesn't make it useless, it just changes what it's useful for. 
Want to buy bananas? Something faster like dash or whatever will be ideal for that in the end.

If I had to choose between QR and plaintext I'd still take the QR though, it's far more resilient because it has built in error correction. When I first made paper wallets I tested it out, it took an incredible amount of damage to make it unreadable. 
Lose one character and that key is useless. Slice through it vertically with a sharpie just once and it's toast. I had to strike through the QR like 4-5 times. I tore the QR code into 4 pieces, and it still scanned....even with only three of the pieces. If the ancient Egyptians kept QR codes on papyrus, I bet the damn things would still scan today.

Do the math. At best there's a few million bitcoin users, but most are in china. Let's say 1 mil in the US, and that's being generous. 99% of them are just dabbling at with an online wallet, 1% gets serious enough to print out a paper wallet - down to 10,000. The majority of the people who take it that far are going to do their due diligence to learn how to do it properly. Let's say a generous 20% still don't get it, so we've got 2,000 potential victims. The vast majority of printers are still wired, so prob about 25% of people will wirelessly print. That's 500 potential victims in the entire US. Even if you live in the middle of NYC, at best your gear is in range of 100 printers. And that's crazy generous, I'm in range of TWO. 
And this is just a few bytes of traffic, so you'd need to capture it 24/7. What are the chances that one of those 500 is in range? One in a million at best.

They are what you use them for. If all you do is keep a small amount in there for occasional spending, they're essentially just a wallet to you. I'm not suggesting anyone should store a significant amount of wealth with them. A hardware wallet is $100 and serves no other purpose, so I effectively have $100 less in my HW wallet than I'd have on coinbase. If I spent $100 on a hardware wallet 2 years ago vs buying $100 of BTC in coinbase I'd essentially have thrown the equivalent of $300-400 away. The cost of the hardware wallet boils down to a bet that your exchange wont go insolvent. Would you bet $100 of BTC at today's rates that coinbase will go insolvent in ten years? I def wouldn't. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:05:41
I think you've spent your whole life just accepting that dollars = money = wealth. And you've never stopped to think about why. 
Why were the first currencies metals like gold? It wasn't cause gold was useful. People didn't just randomly pick gold over iron. It was because it was rare and recognizable. And because everyone knew that, the system worked. I knew you couldn't just create tons of gold at will, and if you had gold, you got it from someone else. You had to trust in the physical properties of gold because civilization hadn't progressed to the point where you could truly trust the govt. 
Eventually we moved to paper money. At first they were just essentially IOUs for gold - if you could take paper money to the bank and they would exchange it for gold, it's essentially as good as gold. Governments eventually decided to take more control over their currency and we dropped the gold standard - people slowly realized you didn't really need the gold anymore, and freeing money from the gold standard made it more functional, because you didn't need to mange giant vaults of shiny metal. It worked as long as the govt stayed faithful to its word that it wouldn't just print it. And why would a powerful government need to? Of course it's happened many times in the past, and it's made some paper money worthless. But the dollar has stuck around because the US is a big and powerful govt - people trust that it's not going anywhere anytime soon, and they're not going to print money like crazy, and dollars are hard to counterfeit. It's still rare and recognizable, and no one can really create it on their own. Ultimately, the system is built on that trust, and the US is powerful and trustworthy. So it works. 
Then bitcoin comes along. It's literally the most trustworthy form of money ever, because it doesn't require trust in anything but math. And math is trustworthy because isn't subject to politics or anything physical. And everyone can see the code, and every node in the world is on the same page. It's also rare - there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, we all know it, and nothing can change that. It's mathematically *proven* to be rare - not even gold could say that. It's recognizable - you can't fake bitcoin transactions, you can't counterfeit it - if I send you one BTC, the entire world knows I have one BTC less and you have one BTC more. It's amazingly transferable - it's slow for face to face, but I can securely send you bitcoin from halfway around the world without involving *any* third parties. You can't do that with gold or dollars. 
Anyway, the point is....people aren't stupid. It's all about trust. They don't decide what to trust randomly. It has to have properties that make it trustworthy. Gold has physical scarcity. Governments have institutions. Bitcoin has math. If someone discovers a new gold mine, the value of gold deteriorates. If the government loses their trust, their money loses value (see: brexit). 
But unless people start to disagree about whether 2 + 2 = 4 or the internet goes down forever, bitcoin will remain trustworthy and fulfill all the essential properties of money. Arguably it's the most trustworthy form of money ever conceived - it's just that people like you don't "get it" yet. I used to think the same way you did, but it eventually clicked. It didn't require faith or believe, it requires understanding how it works and *why* it's trustworthy. 
That's why people here are buying and holding it - we're not betting on people's stupidity, we're betting on their *intelligence*. No one is getting suckered into anything. Almost all the BTC that will ever be created has already been created. Once more and more people start to "get it", they're going to need to acquire it from the people that already have it - and we're not giving it away for free. That's what makes it valuable.

Nope, you still don't get it. A Ponzi scheme is fraudulent accounting. They take your money and send you a statement that's a complete fabrication. They're not holding or investing anything of value, they're spending the money and it all falls apart once too many people try and cash out. 
Bitcoin is the opposite of a Ponzi scheme. The accounting is infallible because it's public and everyone is on the same page. If I send you a bitcoin, the whole world knows about it. If you send that bitcoin to someone else, the whole world knows about it. There's no opportunity for fraud.

Sure, but you'd need to know ahead of time someone is about to print bitcoin keys on a wireless printer during a certain timeframe. Otherwise you're going to be waiting an incredibly long time for that to happen at random within the small bubble of RF signals in range. Anyone clever enough to conceive of the idea is likely smart enough to understand how pointless that endeavor would be. 
I'd wager this scenario where a bitcoin user who lacks basic understanding of cybersecurity is in wireless range of a criminal hacker who doesn't understand probability has never happened in reality and never will.

Sure, I'll take my chances on that. Functionally speaking though, what does a wallet let you do? Store, send and receive BTC. And so does coinbase. For all intents and purposes it's a wallet.

Dude, he's talking about how in either case it's the same percentage of an increase over the current price. If you bought $400 of bitcoin at $400 and it rose to $425, you'd have $425. If you bought $400 of bitcoin at $1600, it would have to rise to $1700 before you had $425. He's trying to point out that these $100 swings aren't really that extreme anymore.

Of course you're not directly mining BTC, you're mining ethereum and selling it for BTC (or just keeping the ETH.)

It offers stability, because it's the most well known crypto. That's really important when crypto's primary value stems from how much *other* people value it.

So were all of those things I mentioned...until they weren't good enough anymore. They failed to progress and got left behind. 
Note that all of those things I mentioned still exist in some form. But they're marginal instead of the dominant player they used to be. I have no doubt that bitcoin will be around and remain useful in some capacity in 20-50 years. But name recognition is only going to get it so far. This is nascent tech, bitcoin is not so firmly entrenched into society that it can't be marginalized, because crypto in general is still little more than a curiosity right now. It's not the iPhone, it's not even a Nokia 5590. It's not even one of those enormous motorola phones from the 80s. At the rate bitcoin is falling behind it'll be looked back upon as little more than a proof of concept. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:12:39
Let me put it this way...I get where you're coming from. I used to think the same thing. It seems crazy right? People just run computers doing pointless math and magically create money? That doesn't make any sense. That sounds like a scam if I've ever heard one. It's got to be. I literally used to call it a Ponzi scheme myself. 
I kept on reading, and eventually learned how the mining was essential to securing the system. It wasn't just a game people were playing and the bitcoins were worthless fake money. It's so hard to wrap your mind around how it works because it's something that seems impossible. It sounds like something that can never work - I can send someone digital money, and they can't copy or counterfeit it? And there's no need for a middleman to verify that? And I don't need to even give up my identity? That goes against literally everything we expect from the internet. So I understand the skepticism. You're right to be skeptical, because it sounds insane at first. Like how is that even possible? It's got to be a scam. You'd be crazy if you didn't think it was a scam at first. At least if it's not a scam, it's got to be fake....
But it's not. Its the first true work of genius of the 21st century IMO. Bitcoin made something previously thought impossible into a reality.

Fueling an alt coin bubble, or people finally realizing that one coin can't be everything to everyone, and that we cant have a healthy cryptocurrency market without competition between currencies? 
The most obvious way to eliminate congestion is for other coins to pick up the slack. Let bitcoin be digital gold, let litecoin be the quick transaction visa replacement. The two competing visions for bitcoin can then go their separate ways and tailor each currency to its purpose. 
Even if they solved this tomorrow, how long until the next civil war? Big business isn't going to want anything to do with bitcoin and it sure as hell isnt going to become the reserve currency of the world if small factions can hold it hostage. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:14:06
For it to have any value at some point you have to interface that private key with software though. QR reader software can run offline, so there's effectively no risk to using one to translate it back to text. There's no reason to use text over QR unless your worried about an apocalypse where the billions of smartphones in the world cease to exist yet somehow bitcoin and the internet continue to function. It's completely implausible. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:29:06
Bitcoin itself is software, which requires hardware....so if you no longer have access to that, your key is worthless anyway. There is literally no plausible situation I can think of where technology is inaccessible and bitcoin retains any sort of value. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:28:42
Anyone who can't answer those questions themselves is much better off buying and holding $150K of bitcoin than buying and holding $150K of mining equipment. Not that mining can't be profitable, but no one should be considering laying out that much cash until they understand the ins and outs of it. 
That said, I'd stick with GPUs at this point. They're not as efficient as ASICs, but an ASIC is literally worthless once it can no longer mine more than it consumes in electricity. But even if a GPU isn't mining profitably its still good for gaming/compute, so you can still recoup most of the cost by reselling it on eBay or whatever.

You've got a fundamental disconnect in your thinking. When you invest your money, it ceases to be money. Same goes with bitcoin. The currency you used to purchase the investment is irrelevant in terms of indexing it's valuation. 
If you lend out your bitcoin, you essentially purchased an IOU for X amount of bitcoin. The value of that bond is tied to bitcoin, but all you own is the bond. You can sell that bond to someone else for USD, you can collect on it in EUR when it's due, etc. Transacting in bitcoin on both ends is obviously the most straightforward way to do it, but it's just a matter of convenience.

That article is nothing but a platitude. That you cant just rollback bitcoin because....you can't. 
Except nothing about what was suggested violates any of the rules or game theory that actually keeps bitcoin secure. For him to say you cant rollback bitcoin you have to define what bitcoin is - and the argument used back in the BCH fork was that "bitcoin is the chain with the most accumulated proof of work." If the "new" chain had that, it would have a "legitimate claim to the throne."
The whole point of bitcoin is that you can't arbitrarily double spend, and that your keys = your coins. There would be nothing arbitrary about this, it would require tons of proof of work and the money to incentivize it. Binance would have to reveal the private key, something they couldn't be forced to do either. 
If they did it, it actually would be "playing by the rules" in the strictest sense of the phrase.

Even the worst GPU miners got off much easier than the ASIC miners. Those guys have it way worse cause no one wants their equipment, but there’s still plenty of gamer demand out there for GPUs. In fact out of all of the ways you could directly invest in crypto, GPU miners lost far less than bitcoin buyers, altcoin buyers or ASIC miners. In terms of BTC, I’m actually net positive on my mining. My income + residual value measured in BTC is higher now than if I just held on to the BTC. 
GPU mining FTW.

I sell over a million dollars a year on eBay. I think I know how eBay works. Go google eBay managed payments and you’ll see what I’m talking about. They’ve been transitioning away from PayPal for years. The “solution they’re perfecting” isn’t about bitcoin, it’s about making their system payment processor agnostic and becoming the primary payment processor themselves. Right now it’s dependent on PayPal. By 2021 PayPal will just be another plugin alongside visa, mastercard, American Express, PayPal and yes...bitcoin. Mark my words. By 2021 the majority of eBay sellers will be “accepting” bitcoin without even knowing it.

I disagree - there’s nothing wrong with custodians in theory. Deposit banking is an ancient and legitimate service. Bitcoin is great in that you have a much more realistic potential to be your own bank, but I don’t see why that’s critical aside from the fact that current custodians are inadequate. In theory there should be ways to have the security of a professional custodian without handing your keys over. If anything it’s far more important for the industry to find ways to combine the best of both worlds, rather than force people to revert to hiding their net worth under a digital mattress. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:01:30
I wouldn’t call isolated payment channels a layer above bitcoin, because its an island upon itself. A layer is pervasive and covers and extends the underlying network. Lightning network is a layer, payment channels are not.

It shouldn't be a requirement, but the ability for both sides of a transaction to confirm beyond any shadow of a doubt that funds sent will be received would go a long way. The absolute worst thing about bitcoin and crypto right now are the crazy addresses and the fact that you have to cross your fingers and pray that the address is exactly right. And it doesnt help that depending on the wallet/exchange you might not even see it received for up to an hour. This isnt a problem with paypal because email addresses are human readable and worst case you can just call paypal if things don't go as planned. Whereas a BTC address is gibberish and there's no one to call if something goes wrong - and I know that there's checksumming, and BTC can't just disappear - but you have no idea how much anxiety this stuff causes for new crypto users.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:08:28

@_date: 2018-12-30 18:11:52
No, split the 12/24 words into three sets (A, B, C). Make three pucks - AB, AC and BC. Any two of them can recreate the whole key. Now put them in three different places, preferably dispersed geographically. 
This has many important consequences - if any one puck is compromised, it’s useless without one of the others. Or if any one puck is destroyed or lost, you can always recreate it from the other two. You can also leave one with a trusted individual/heir without giving up your full keys.
For example I have one hidden in my house, one in a safe deposit box at a bank far away from my house, and one with a trusted individual. Even if my house was randomly swallowed up by a sinkhole, I’d still be able to get the other two. Or if I randomly kicked the bucket, my wife knows where one is and can get to the other one in the safe deposit box - but not without my permission or death certificate.
It’s far more secure and resilient in every way - the physical medium should be like the least of your concerns. You can make it from pure titanium and all I’d have to do to get your keys is put a gun to your head.

Incorrect. **One of** Bitcoin’s unique selling points is that one has the **option** to have complete monetary sovereignty. Which gives people the **freedom** to do whatever the fuck they want, which includes securing them with a custodian and taking the risk that funds can be censored or seized.
Not everyone wants to be their own bank with 100% of their money, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Deal with it. It’s the literal reason why banks were created in the first place many centuries ago.

Your problem is you’re thinking in black and white extremes, and you’re thinking backwards. 
You wish you sold everything at the tippy top (which was like a one week window) but you obviously didn’t because you thought the sky was the limit, now you’re selling everything (potentially at the bottom, could be a one week window of opportunity too) because you’re worried about losing it all. 
And you’re thinking backwards because you thought the fact that it was going up means that it’s going to keep going up, just like you think the fact that it’s going down means it’s going to keep going down. The reality is the opposite - the further it goes crazy in one direction or the other, the more likely it is to get dragged back in the other direction. 
Take a seat back and relax. Will I tell you it’s not going to $2000, $1000 or zero, or that it’s going to $1 million? Nope. But I can tell you that it’s not going to do either in a week. And the truth is you never had 2 million dollars. You had ~100 BTC, and now you have ~350K. Ultimately do whatever you feel is right, of course - just remember you made a lot of money already. You sure you want to check out completely of something that’s made you a lot of money?

Sure, and its a great design because of the freedom you have to not be forced into behaving the way some authority wants you to behave.

I’ll bet anything it’s true. I’m a big eBay seller and they’ve been talking for years about transitioning to being the their own centralized payment processor instead of farming it all out to PayPal. Their new platform is in beta right now and already accepts Apple Pay, google pay, credit cards and PayPal. It would be no problem for them to accept bitcoin. 
Right now the way eBay works is eBay sets up the sale and the buyer pays the seller directly through PayPal. Within 2 years the way eBay will work is eBay sets up the sale, the buyer pays eBay, and every day the seller gets a payout to their bank account. 
But make no mistake, this is about eBay accepting bitcoin, paying sellers in dollars and taking a cut along the way. This is not about eBay allowing people to transact directly peer to peer and cutting out the middleman. It’s still a good thing though and opens up a HUGE marketplace to crypto. In theory eBay could support lightning and all that. In theory they could optionally pay sellers out in BTC (but you can be sure they’re still taking their cut for “managing” the process). 
It’ll still be using and accepting bitcoin in *most* of the ways that matter.

@_date: 2019-05-13 02:46:26
If you think this is all about protecting PayPal, why are they accepting Apple Pay and google pay under their new system? Why did they implement them **before** PayPal in their managed payment system? You have no idea wtf you’re talking about here. The eBay selling community was in a total fucking uproar because eBay was doing everything they could to minimize PayPal under their new system. On their faq page there is literally a calculator where they are trying to show you how much less sellers will pay eBay vs. PayPal. These are separate companies now and eBay does not want PayPal monopolizing their payments anymore. They want that money for themselves, and unlike Apple Pay, unlike google pay and even unlike credit cards - with bitcoin they could be the **sole intermediary.** They have every reason to support bitcoin now that they’re not married to PayPal. Because they don’t have to pay visa or Apple or google or anyone else to use it. 
And I use bitcoin all the time douchebag. I buy tons of hardware with it directly from sellers. I accept it in my business and people have used it frequently. Can I use it through eBay? Nope, not yet at least. But I accept that when I’m selling through eBay, I’m selling on someone else’s platform. So I’m fine with them being the payment processor. It doesn’t stop me from using it when I’m off their platform.

In the sense that you can’t send someone fake bitcoin. Try sending BCH to someone expecting BTC, the chance they’ll accept it as real BTC is zero. Their wallet won’t even recognize it as BTC. Try handing a counterfeit $100 bill to someone and there’s a realistic chance you get away with it.

@_date: 2019-05-09 17:26:44
So thinking out loud....is this really that bad though? In theory since they’d have to start 50 blocks back,  they could replay exactly the same transactions in those 50 blocks but the bad one in question 50 blocks ago. As long as the hacked address didn’t mix with other coins too much (or at all) in the meantime, they could present the world with the reorged blockchain **with proof of work**, that had to be mined by miners at a steep cost to binance. It feels like a more legitimate and decentralized way to handle the situation rather than something forced down people’s throats by a centralized party. There would need to be consensus behind the new chain, but they’d have at least 50 blocks of proof it was an “honest” reorg. If everyone could clearly see that it was done “honestly”, why *wouldnt* there be consensus around it? It wouldn’t be changing the way bitcoin works by arbitrarily forking it, it would be using bitcoin the way it actually works. Wouldn’t this fall under the same thinking of “there’s no such thing as a spam transaction if someone is willing to pay for it?” In other words if the consensus is that bitcoin is the chain with the most PoW, and here’s a new chain with more PoW - it has a “legitimate” claim to be the real bitcoin, and no one but the thief got double spent - I’m just not sure why anyone would oppose that?
