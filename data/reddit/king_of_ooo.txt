There are lots of criminals in the world of fiat currency, as you rightly point out.  But I have not heard of a hack that cleaned out a major national exchange, or stole 6% of any nation's e-currency in one shot.
When criminals hack a bank, they can usually be tracked by the trail of electronic transfers and the funds recovered.  When hackers got my credit card details last year, the credit card company ate the loss and refunded the fraudulent charges.
How many more of these massive BTC hacks can the system sustain before people lose confidence?

I remember Newsweek from the  fail.  Needless to say I don't have high hopes for this article. They won't be around long as a print magazine.

Mods, please delete this submission.  Spam like this is dangerous for the Bitcoin community because the hyperlink from Reddit and other places can cause the site to appear higher in search results for "Bitcoin ATM".  If new users discover it via google, and it is run by scammers, disappointment will ensue.

Hackers are clever little bastards. They'll get the other exchanges &amp; businesses eventually. 
It is a cyberpunk currency par excellence, but most people aren't ready for crypto-anarchy.

Artificial scarcity will only drive price up if there is growing demand.  
There is a fixed number of Beanie Babies that were ever produced in the world.  In fact, the number is decreasing as people throw the old ones away, lose them, etc.  but the price will only go to what a buyer is willing to pay, and could go down if the community loses interest in the item.

Good.  The police, Interpol, FBI, should all be involved.  If Bank of America lost $300,000,000 of deposits and shut down their website one day out of the blue, you can bet that's what would happen.

Why the downvotes? This person should be in jail for fraud [serious].

As an outsider, curious about bitcoin, I have the following observations:
-The largest 'exchange' was run by an amateur clown with no financial services experience.
-Hackers stole 6% of all bitcoins in existence from the above exchange.
-The bitcoin 'community' appears to be made up of raving teenaged lunatics who idolize a pseudonymous person named Satoshi Nakamoto, who apparently does not want his real name associated with BTC.
-It appears to be very hard to actually buy, and near impossible to SELL, a bitcoin.
So, weighting the above, I would rather invest in a range of other assets (property, stocks, currencies, etc.) than in BTC.
I welcome your thoughts.

Thank you for taking the time to reply.  
The process you describe to purchase things from Amazon by setting up a wallet and going through Gyft actually sounds rather complicated and convoluted.  I have a visa debit card on file with Amazon so it is almost one-click purchasing.
I do not have a US bank account so Coinbase is off limits for me.  But thank you for the tip.
The fanbase in this subreddit is unbelievable to me. I cannot post often because most of my contributions have been downvoted rabidly. Mostly, posts that are favourable to BTC are upvoted.
The double payment problem appears not to have been completely solved.  That was part of the 'malleability' flaw in Gox, no?
I see Gox as symptomatic of the wider BTC 'business' community.  I use scare-quotes, because there seem to be many amateurs and potential scammers playing make-believe CEO and setting up companies that cannot scale or are malicious.
As an outsider with good technical (but by no means expert) skill, even I am convinced that hackers or scammers would easily get my coins before I could do anything useful with them.  Let alone recommend their use to someone like my aunt who lives on a farm.

How did this fat bastard come up with the $200,000 or so he reportedly paid McCaleb for the site when he bought it?

If only they had shut him down earlier, perhaps people wouldn't have lost so much money.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:23:34
Well, there are 400m stolen coins unaccounted for in the Mt Gox collapse.  Maybe hackers are looking to launder their money someplace...

No I mean the bitcoin community in general idolizes 'him'.  But hiding behind a pseudonym does not exactly breed confidence in the general public.

We already know that Satoshi is Nick Szabo:
He probably wants nothing to do with bitcoin in its current state.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:22:37
Well the coins are likely never coming back from the hacker underworld, so putting him in jail at least sends the message that running a global financial services company is not to be taken lightly by amateur wannabe CEOs.

Arrest Karpeles for fraud, try to track down and arrest the hackers who stole millions worth of transactions, write laws to tighten up the requirements for new fly-by-night companies that want to do financial services business in Japan.  The authorities could do many things.

IMHO I think it is important that Bitcoiners accept that 'Satoshi Nakamoto' is not a real person.  Pinning ones hopes to a mythical character is unhealthy, and doesn't help the credibility of bitcoin.  The inventor should step forward and claim credit, otherwise it is like a religion with some sort of magical prophet.

Mark has been using slippery language.  Nobody knows if they were stolen by a single hacker, stolen by a group of hackers over time, or lost because he lost access to them.
Those details are important to understand!

They are in the hands of the hacker / criminal underworld.  Where all bitcoins are likely to end up eventually.

To give some perspective as an outsider, $7000 for an internet token is not 'cheap'.
