I was thinking in the scenario where crypto is the currency of the future, but how would different economies handle this? Example: a loaf of bread may cost 0.0001 btc in the U.S.; Would it cost less in a developing country? If yes, is it correct to say someone still has to "bind" bitcoin to a value?

If fiat money and precious metals are what crypto currencies have to be pegged to, doesn't that mean we are still at the mercy (sort of) of the banks and financial institutions?

Really appreciate your time taken to reply!
Totally concur on how the current powers won't let go of fiat that easy...
So, in a worst case scenario, crypto becomes simply another digital currency (albeit more secure), as compared with the grand vision of changing the economy as we know it?
