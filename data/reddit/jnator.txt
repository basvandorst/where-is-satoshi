I'm just going to ask you about this because I seem to be in a loss here. Do you have an idea on how to run security and protection for the people on a free market? Are you suggesting that mercenarie-like people or corporations are gonna be our security from others or are you implying something different entirely?

It's not, but there's a difference from the way things work. I just think police would be a difficult thing to commercialize properly. And it's not exactly a war on the people compared to a military.

You might be right.


Only reason I'm asking is because there should be an idea behind what people says, and in this case it would be kind of a problem to decentralize something as public security without being sure about how things would turn out.
The solution with a free market on security would probably be better some places than others, depending on the state of the current police of the country. Some countries might not be better off shifting from a wholecountry-spanning security system to a lot of smaller businesses, each more prone to corruption than the original (if the original isn't already seeped through by it). 
The strenght of security on a free market would probably be the possibilities, the choices the people have when picking their protection, but like I said before, might be more prone to corruption from outside sources, in form of buyouts, and maybe even competition with bigger security firms.
I can't relate wether it would be a preferable way for some countries, which it might be in your case, but for my country the safest bet is the state controlled police, as it has better structure and regulation than what could be offered with a free market.

I guess I stand corrected for being an idiot who doesn't do proper research before posting.
But wouldn't say it's the opposite.

In most countries, there's a restriction of which currencies are legal to use, and it can be illegal to use foreign currency as payment. I think the reason Bitcoin isn't considered illegal is because it's not seen as an actual currency. It's mostly seen as an item or commodity or whatnot. It's simply not big enough to actually be seen as a currency, as it only makes up an extremely small value compared to for example USD.

You sure about that?
