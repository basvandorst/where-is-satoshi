Got through, after half an hour, lady did not speak English, I tried to use Google translate, no luck.
I asked to be put through to some on who speaks English, she said ok, waited a little, then call got cut off. 
**Update:** Tried again, the second worker spoke better English, tried the bot thing and said speak English. She took my name, and my question. She told she does not work for MtGox and  that enquires will be passed on. She said the website will be updated depending on Japanese Courts (Not entirely sure what she meant by that). 
She said she wasn't at liberty to discuss everything and to wait for the website update.

My 6th of January SEPA withdrawal didn't come either. :(

That's exactly what I did. My assigned agent just keeps saying it's in a queue.

SEPA withdrawals are not working fine. Placed my Withdrawal 6th of Jan. Still nothing. Support is not helping either.

Take his words with a pinch of salt. 
I'm British and I think he's one of the worst things that happened to the US, in fact the Universe.

I have waited almost a month for my SEPA withdrawal. As of 29th they were clearing the 20 day backlog. Well my withdrawal has been more than 20 days!
