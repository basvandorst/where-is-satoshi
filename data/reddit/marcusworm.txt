No lie. The guy in light blue is my mate - they sell suits in London. They recently just left after fitting some people in the bank. My bro in the blue has been sporting that Bitcoins bag for nearly 2 years. Its brilliant timing.

Guy in blue is my close mate. He’s just left after fitting suits. He’s a tailor. He also loves Bitcoin and this timing is amazing.
Makes a point of taking that bag into every bank he fits.

What causes a large transaction in bytes??

You get the idea
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:38:41
I guess that's possible but it's accurate. No words in my phrase offer 2 variances in spelling.

Does bread show the realtime value of your coins like Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:30:11
Not sure what this means
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:47:42
It worked! It did a normal scan at first but I needed to go to settings and do a full scan. Thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:28:23
Yep sure did
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:39:39
Mine syncs like normal but then just say nil. I only have 1 wallet with one phrase so I can't mistake it.
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:29:54
It seems to have already finished scanning though and says nil balance...
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:48:06
Thanks. Im using Coinbase. Would you suggest moving them to bread or mycelium then?

Great help. Is there a way of knowing what bitcoins I have now (legacy or 148)? 
Which app wallet is the safest for storing the BTC would you say? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:39:14
I guess there is definitely a sense of gambling for me. Iv read about it for hours and hours but how can we really know what the plan is? Realistically? 
You buy shares in a company, the company grows and so does your share.
How can we compare bitcoin like this? If bitcoin sky rockets how can it be used as a currency??

Which did you try?
