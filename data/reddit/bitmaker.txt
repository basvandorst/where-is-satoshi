You guys are no way near the real truth! RDF107 how do you manage to keep your funds in Gensis-Mining.com, it is basicaly impossible? You can get paid out in cheeper coins to get the mining running longer if not profitbel with your contract + you get your payouts every day instead of waiting fore the amount to be high enough to get paid out. When you choose coin to mine with auto over the coin ti mines the most profitebel coin on that algo. Genesis is unike pleas don't talk about stuff you have no idee about. It is always a risk in investing. You buy mining equipment and pay for power up front(not bitcoin). You can't get a better deal then that on rising prises in the crypto space. It is not a scam it is mining, if you don't understand it don't do it.
Technicaly you need to expand with your earnigs, like every miner need to do. Plus you bet that that will increase in the long run like all mining. We don't have enough users in crypto to earn much higher then orginal blockfee. If 100 fold more start useing cryptocoins over night you would be roi in no time..

so basicly mining in general is not worth it? if GM is not worth it I guess crypto is not worth it? You one of thoose that say buy and hold insteed? You don't get profit of your coins when holding unless you have some insane staking coin. I have over $500 profit with genesis mining I will contiinue to invest my earnings and grow my income.
