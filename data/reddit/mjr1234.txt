The current site is very much under construction. We are, however, still able to take requests, fulfill orders, and answer questions! We posted here as we believe that any new business accepting BTC is inherently news, as it is contributing to Bitcoin's inevitable universal acceptance!

Thanks for the feedback! However, f you take a closer look at the paragraph above the table, you will see that those prices are simply the BARE minimum.

Thanks for the feedback, even if you might be sarcastic!

Dear Bitcoin,
Please Protect my funds, with all of your decentralized glory.
Please protect the well being of bitcoin.org, for it is without their guidance that I would have long ago fallen.
I ask that you forgive me for my payments with little confirmations, as I forgive those who confirm low on theirs. 
And Bitcoin, please, in all of your glory, protect us all from glitched and stuck Bitcoins. 
In Blockchain's name, amen.

I'm trying to gauge exactly how much the public would be interested in the item. I feel as though reddit is the best place for such a query.

We actually have a page dedicated to samples of our writing. As stated, this site is simply to let everyone know that we are here. Our web designers are working tirelessly to add some appeal to the site. But, it is our opinion that it's always good to maintain a web presence. And so, as our company grows, so will our website.

Who the fuck paid for this to happen?
