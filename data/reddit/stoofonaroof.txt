Do you feel its safe/worth it to upload my passport image to coinbase along with my drivers license (Canadian citizen) just to verify so I can use GDAX to withdraw to my ledger??

I have been trying to create a GDAX account to get my BTC off of Coinbase and into my ledger for close to 2 weeks with no success. What a piece of shiet

GDAX is asking me for drivers license and other verification, I have tried so many times, have tried verifying on coinbase as well
I log into my account in GDAX, it goes automatically through verification process and asks me to wait 3-5 minutes, then it says to come back and check periodically,

Thank you, the GDAX account verification only times out and asks me to check back periodically. I will focus my efforts on getting verified through the coinbase app (easier said than done)

i am able to make credit card purchases, but canadian resident and its asking me for more verification on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:53:33
The whole point reading this sub was that its free to transfer off gdax, but not coinbase, and again this doesn't make much sense, neither does being able to purchase via credit card but then require more verification afterwards on an associated exchange.. which i can then transfer for free, hummmmmmmm

I bought at 17k USD which I believe is close to your number
Do you plan to buy more at the current dip? or sell as soon as it reaches 25k$ LOL
