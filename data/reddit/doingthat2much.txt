My view on possible future cryptocurrencies is dim, at best. Bitcoin is revolutionary. REVOLUTIONARY! It takes the gold-paradigm that was the basis for wealth since ... for a very long time, and it effectively displaces it once and for all.
This is equivalent to the invention of the cheeseburger. And then people add bacon. Yes, bacon cheeseburgers are definitely better, but not as revolutionary as portable handheld grilled beef.
That said, the litecoin seems to act as a commodity. Bitcoin does, but has a value-basis. Litecoin does not actually seem to have a value-basis (IMO), but as long as it's behaving as a commodity, I will continue to trade them. 
I just don't see a retailer embracing litecoins. I'd imagine that a retailer faced with the litecoin question has already accepted bitcoin. And then, from his view, "Why would I embrace litecoin when it offers nothing more than I already have in bitcoin?"
So people talk about bitcoin bubble, but in my view, litecoin is the *real* bubble. Have fun with it, just don't be caught without a chair when the music stops.

Jewelry is a long way from intrinsic value, IMO. I believe that gold is Earth's standard placeholder for value (monetary unit) because it is an element of sufficiently limited abundance.
If gold's intrinsic value comes from jewelry, more of it would actually BE jewelry, instead of bullion.
He actually touched on bitcoin's intrinsic value: Instantaneous transfer (and he might have said anonymity, but he didn't). Then he said this is NOT intrinsic value, when it clearly is. I can go around the world millions of times before bullion moves an inch.
Low fees, another thing he could have said, is obvious intrinsic value. Mastercard or visa do not set our transfer fees: We do.
I typically have deep respect for Peter Schiff, but I stopped watching halfway through when he said he paid his taxes to not go to jail (throwing his father under the bus, who actually refused to pay taxes on principle, and went to jail for it).
People fear new things, I guess. Schiff is a smart guy who doesn't like bitcoin. I guess not everyone's going to like something just because it's super fucking cool.

I've given this some casual thought. Previous concepts of wealth were based on gold reserves. Which are not actually as scalable as bitcoin is, if you think about it. What was the fractional reserve requirement just before the banking collapse? 80:1? (someone chime in here).
Well, the bitcoin valuation goes down to 10E-8. It really could revolutionize concepts of money and wealth. I do not think 'trillionaire' is appropriate (you are already a trillionaire in Zimbabwe, for instance), though, because if a bitcoin were $1 million dollars, the dollar would not be the defacto currency anymore. The bitcoin would be. As such Satoshi would be simply a millionaire, but that would still be really formidable -- and come with a brand new concept of wealth. 
I think it's interesting, but unlike so many of our previous concepts of money and wealth. Think about it. Are we even aware of how much we think in terms of dollars? Would anyone argue that the Dollar is the world's currency? In order to truly appreciate the bitcoin, everyone would have to see what a terrible idea the dollar is ... When it had gold backing it was old, and now that it has NO gold backing, it is positively DECREPIT.
I know a really smart dude, who simply can not separate his concept of money from the dollar -- I'm sure we all know that guy! Until that happens, the bitcoin can not appreciate to a million of those other things.

My friend is always saying bitcoin isn't a currency, it's a commodity. Somehow it is a slam-dunk to him that b/c bitcoin fluctuations behave more like investments in commodities than a government-regulated (which a libertarian might read 'doctored') currency, it CLEARLY does not qualify as a currency.
Nothing I say to him seems to do any good tho'... I tried FOREX, gold-standard ... The fact that WW2 pilots were given gold coins as *currency* in case they got shot down ... Literally NOTHING does any good.
Maybe we should prepare ourselves for Peter Schiff being hard-headed about bitcoin.

Ok, that means they were NOT stolen. Which is good. Now all you have to do is keep trying your passwords.
I suggest using a pen and paper at this point.
"Foo Bar"
"foo bar"
"Foo Bar!"
"Foo Bar."
... etc. That is your best option. Now when I tried the brain wallet for myself for the first time yesterday (when I read your post), I noticed that I made a typo twice. The same typo.
"I am Rita's unble."
"I am Rita's unble."
I did not notice that I had done it twice until I clicked 'show.'
So once you get through all the passwords (I am still hoping that one of them works!), you have to try some likely consistent typos. Like I said, I believe that the password thing should work. But you are going to HAVE to have a pen and paper to organize and ensure that you've tried all the possible variations.

Ah! I got it!
BitAddress's interface is slightly buggy. If you type two passphrases that do NOT match, then click 'Show', and THEN 'View', it will NOT alert you that your phrases do not match.
What this means for you is that your passphrase is not what you think it is. It means that for you to unlock your 3.29 btc, you're going to need a little luck.
"I am a green giant."
"I ama green giant."
"I am a g reen giant."
"i ama green giant."
If this does not work, your last option would be to reach out to the hacker community. For a small fee, they will point some code at it and try to crack it.

OP is a fa... I mean OP's post was not about the product. Which OP thought was phenomenal.
OP's allegation is that bitcoin is not a currency until people fix their prices in bitcoin and think natively in bitcoin instead of dollars. OP adds the qualifier that it is a currency *insofar* as people do this, and a commodity *insofar* as bitcoin is priced in dollars mentally FIRST, and products for sale in bitcoin are priced FIRST in dollars.
So we have a sliding scale, commodity at one end and currency at the other. OP just wants to push the scale to the 'currency' end. OP does not like referring to himself as 'OP'.

How did you send your btc to that brain wallet key? What was the address? Go to blockchain for that address, and the date you sent the coins (and amount), click on that destination address --- and confirm that your 3.29 btc are STILL THERE (they may have already been stolen as brain wallets are considered weak).
If they are still there, just keep trying to remember the password. Case matters (case sensitive). Punctuation matters. Spelling matters. It has to be EXACTLY the same. $3,290 is incentive enough to keep trying.
Other than that... you don't have much recourse.

Some of the alt coins are verified (confirmed) pump-and-dump schemes. Google 'premining' (though premining does not always imply an invalid alt-coin).
Hostility implies threat. There is no threat to bitcoin from alt-coins. But if people don't know that, they will react fearfully. Which you and I both observe.
Even the best alt-coin (IMO: litecoins) does not actually offer anything that bitcoin does not (I know, I know: more coins, distribution, faster confirmations -- maybe I should say nothing *groundbreaking* that bitcoin does not).
As such it seems insidious. But it really isn't. Back in the 80's it was Advil vs. Tylenol. And people missed the point entirely until about 2000 -- they were owned by the SAME company, and the point of the "war" was merely to convince you that you needed one or the other!
As such, bitcoin vs. litecoin can only sell more cryptocurrencies. So the "war" is actually good for the cryptocurrency "business" --- only insofar as people do not get scammed!  (I still think that all the other alt-coins are scams. I've looked into each of them at one point or another, and I do not see any as viable except bitcoin and litecoin).
To say that litecoin is silver to bitcoin gold proves accurate almost daily (again: my opinion).

L-I-A-R. See Greenspan, Bernanke, et. al.
Back in '05 I read a book called "World Economy" by Rudolf Steiner. In it, he explained that you should never lend money based on home equity because it inflates prices, as the homeowner has to jack-up the sale-price to repay the interest on the loan. Very simple. The book was written in 1921, and this was common-thinking in the Austrian school at the time.
So even if we were to say that the Fed did not engineer the Great Depression (which is a stretch!!!), how could we say that the Collapse of '08 was anything but intentional as the Fed kept the prime rate at near-zero even as natural market forces attempted to buoy it?
TL;DR: The Fed engineers bubbles.

That's a great answer. I'm still embarrassed, though. I think that when human history is taught 500 years from now, students will marvel at how rapidly we could have changed things -- yet how we collectively chose not to. It was too "convenient" to always maintain our present course (though nothing about it *is* convenient). 
I could apply that to anything. The environment. Childhood obesity. Anything ... anything at all. We could have fixed merely by changing our minds about it.

No, gold is the most malleable element on Earth, even more so than copper. Easy to work with, cultures have made jewelry with just their fingers.
It does not oxidize, making it great for ornamentation. It is also a better conductor than copper. Which gives it intrinsic value NOT related to jewerly (I believe NASA uses gold in a lot of space applications).
So jewelry aspect is not merely because it represents wealth, even though it does.

That's true. It is a vicious circle of sorts. To the extent that it's viewed as a commodity, its price reacts to investments.  Making it difficult to use as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:34:31
I appreciate that. It also serves as user feedback. From an application point of view, if I am about to send some btc, my wallet converts to dollars. If I am off by a decimal point, I can say "WHOAA, I was about to send $100 for a packet of honey caramels..." instead of say $10 or $1.
But the talking heads that are saying BTCis a commodity and not a currency ARE correct insofar as people still think in dollars. Even the people accepting BTC on their sites do not fix their prices in BTC, but in dollars first. This means that the same honey caramels that I bought for 0.10 BTC last year are now 0.01 BTC.
Does this sound like a currency to you?

There is no anger. I labelled my reaction as 'embarrassment', which is far from anger. But I know that this is reddit and people are angry, and so they think everyone else is angry, too.
The only argument I'd listen to about it not being a currency is the argument I've not yet heard in the thread.
Currencies represent national offerings. Reflecting physical attributes of the nation-states, eg. Cranberries only grow in North America. Coffee grows most easily near the equator. Gold comes from countries with mountains, etc.
If bitcoin were truly a global currency, how COULD it be used to fix prices without an absolute scale of value? How could there be an absolute scale, given that the offerings of the nation states are totally different, reflecting a relative scale of values?

If I buy 100 shares of GM corp at $2 and it goes down to $1. Did I lose money?
Yes. But did I lose *value*? No! I still have my 100 shares of GM corp. And depending on where my values are, I either value the dollar investment or the shares of the GM corp. Otherwise, why did I purchase the shares at all?
In the case of your example, I value the bitcoin, and I value the coffee -- equally. Where exactly does the dollar come into play? (Hint: it doesn't. Once you are enjoying your coffee, whether it's bitcoin or dollar won't matter).
So, yes, the market is volatile, but it's obvious to me why: The Dollar is still the World's standard of value. In bitcoin we truly have a global standard, but the places to spend your dollar vs. the places to spend your bitcoin... well, there is still a large (coughs) gap.
So this volatility will continue until the number of places to spend bitcoin is on a par with the liquidity of the dollar.
EDIT: Sorry, I am a wanna-be-lurker. Do not expect replies to comment replies. I merely want to point out, from an Austrian point of view, that the Bitcoin's volatility is because we're pricing things first in dollars, then converting to BTC. This ... we should not do. A cup of coffee FEELS to me like 0.01 BTC. Of course, that's more expensive in dollars than starbucks. But then again, a BTC always felt to me like $500 value (based on how I felt when I had a whole coin in my pocket). Which would make the coffee $5. Which works out for me. If we stop thinking in dollars and start thinking in BTC, this volatility thing will just evaporate.
