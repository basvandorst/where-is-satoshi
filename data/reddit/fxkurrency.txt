The health of the protocol is driven by its price, there is a correlation and if you can't see it I'm afraid you're in delusion. The protocol is nothing without its price, most people see Bitcoin as a store of value/currency not a technological experiment (even though that's where the attention ought to be). Face reality, Bitcoin has fallen 40% since the start of the year, everybody is panicking right now, confidence is at its lowest. Bitcoin dies in 2015, it has been compromised.

Analyze this a bit more, Russia has been weary of the Bitcoin ever since it surfaced in the mainstream. They are not scared that Russians will accept BTC as their new currency, nobody is that stupid. 
Bitcoin has been infiltrated by American banks - thus the price fall. Putin sees this and that's the reason behind the ban.

Haha! My exact thoughts :).

Do not delude yourselves my friend, just sell and move on.

There are far more better alternatives as a "store of value" for Russians than Bitcoin. Have you heard about the Euro? Gold? Hell even investing in electronics would be better than hoarding BTC! 
WAKE UP People! Bitcoin WAS AN EXPERIMENT, it was a sneak peek towards the real deal. Another cryptocurrency will take its place and be there to last decades, Bitcoin is over. Just admit it.

It won't last 10 - 15 years, by then another cryptocurrency would have already taken its place. Bitcoin will end this year, trust me.

It will range between $44 - $117, but rarely go over that. Sorry, btc is dead.

:) There will be no more high my friend. Bitcoin dies in 2015.

You are very naive my friend. Very naive. It will not make it, BTC was too new and gave us a peak of what is to be expected in the future, but it was not strong enough to make it. 
The Chinese have been driving the price down for the past few months and I believe they have majority control over the protocol at this point. The American banks will NEVER let such a disruptive technology to take place, never at all. Do you realize how much control they would lose, they would rather nuke the planet before letting something like that happen.

I feel like everybody is in delusion lmao.

No, you fail. All of you who bought BTC around $600+ are all doomed. LMAO
