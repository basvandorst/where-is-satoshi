Built it for the very same reason you are building yours I guess! Making stuff more accessible, prettier and easier. Hated Blockfolio from day one, the UX is absolutely terrible. Looks like a developer built it, not a designer :P
Goal of the site is to have a lot more features, including premium features. Currently working on a mobile app and a dedicated backend (it's using Firebase right now). Once those two things are up and running, a lot more features will be added very quickly.
It's a lot of work to decouple from Coinmarketcap, which is great for an MVP, but their API is very unreliable. In the 6 months or so of CoinTrackr's existence, the API failed several times, leaving users without their portfolio.
Just something to keep in mind!

Thank you very much Appreciate it and everything you mentioned is already on the todo. I actually just hired a developer that will help me do that in the next few weeks and months.
Stay tuned! :)
