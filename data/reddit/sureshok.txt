I set this up over the weekend and opened a node on my phone. Took a while to get confirmations but when it was up i bought some starblocks no worries. The tx was instant. Pretty exciting! 
Edit:does anyone know if the testnet pays out tx fees back to you if your node gets used?  I didn't have mine on for long

Seriously his followers on twitter are so cult like. I really think bcash supporters are like the crypto version of people who pay money to evangelists like benny hinn or whatever the fuck his name was.  It's always the same arguement "bcash follows the white paper blah blah" but they never seem to address the fact that the white paper says DECENTRALISED and they're running a fork that is bound to end up centralised. It just seems crazy to me

He seems strangely calm about increased volume. Hopefully they can get the mempool down again before the 10th i guess.  
edit: That talk definitely makes it seem much less sinister if you look at it from a miners point of view.  Maybe more people will take up mining because of futures?

Can anyone try and decipher what his motives might be with this post? I mean he's set the buy for 600 USD? The price seems to be steadily dropping but if it gets that low again and he doesn't just cancel his order and it fills. What happens? It surges again and people cash out again? Then Rinse repeat? Honest question.  This just seems like a ploy to make some easy money for big whales at everyone else's expense. Apologies if I'm way off base I don't fully understand.

Well, vending machines use light sensors and electromagnets to measures the coin that's inserted. Some if not most will also eject a coin that is not valid, but then some coins are so similar that they're mistaken as the local currency so the vending machine will accept them as payment.  A wallet is not a vending machine anyway.  
As for BCH being based on pre segwit BTC, you'll have to elaborate as i don't understand what point you're trying to make. 
The developers should have changed the address format before they forked. They were warned numerous times.

Fuck. I remember this post from ages ago. The price dipped shortly after iirc and I felt bad for you because at the time I wished I had 5k to spend to 1btc, but then I got that sinking in my gut at the thought of the dip. Gratz for holding on mate!  Must feel amazing now!
Edit: have you continued to buy in? Or just the 5k? What do you plan to do come tax time? AFAIK we don't have to declare unless it's over 10k at sale. The govt website is so vague.

I got the same reply from Trezor. There is not a lot they can do. They're not a mining service, they sell hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:41:34
Then it sounds like you haven't used the same address on the BTC blockchain. I would get into contact with BTC.com and see if they can help you recover the coins
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:21:38
It is genius.  I have learned so much more about transactions from my fuck up in a way i'm happy it happened. 
edit: i might add here that i have been following the BCH dev mailing list and they have been arguing  for weeks about changing the address format for this exact reason. A number of people have raised it as an issue but it seems to get brushed aside each time.

Here i was losing sleep over .47 BCH...  Glad to hear you got your coins back! I wasn't aware of that article, but i'm sure there will be more like it and hopefully as the deadline draws closer more people will come forward.  Spare a thought for the poor soul who sent 81.5 BCH. I'm waiting for them to come forward! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:31:23
So your problem is solved now?
edit: sorry i don't quite understand. The problem is if you send BCH to a segwit BTC address the transaction will never go through. It won't show up in any wallet, it will only show up in the block chain as an unspent output. Which if you don't then go and use that same segwit BTC address to send BTC,  BTC.com offered to mine that block again without broadcasting it to recover that BCH. I was in contact with one of their tech leads who i don't really want to disclose without his permission. I would suggest using twitter to contact BTC.com as that is what i did and go from there.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:56:28
My transaction has been broadcast to the network and i am just waiting for confirmations. has been helping me for the best part of four hours to find a way for me to verify ownership of my BCC. which i finally was able to do.  
edit: i should add it is a zero fee transaction so i am going to assume he will mine one block a day with all the transactions that he has created. I hope.  When i have the coins in my wallet i will shout his name from the rooftops.
Edit: So my TX has finally been picked up in a block. I cannot confirm if u/bchsegwitrecover mined the block as i have not had any word from him. I posted my TX on twitter to a few BCH mining pools and then 10 mins later it had confirmations.  For me, this is finally over. I now have the joy of deleting my trezor and starting fresh. Lesson learned. what a ride.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:10:11
have you spent any coins on the chain since you sent them to the wrong address?
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:10:15
Can someone please clarify, If i leave my BTC on my trezor during the fork will i still be able to move my BTC to an exchange after the fork to claim my BTX?
edit: i think i got the explanation from some sources, i was confused as people were saying "if you have your BTC on coinbase during the fork etc" I can store my BTC on my trezor and move it to an exchange that honors the new coin after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:50:02
This is the solution yes.  I have signed a message for u/bchsegwitrecover, so just waiting for a reply and for it to be verified.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:51:31
I was in the process of getting my tx remined by bitmain, but he beat them to it. All the people in the list are people who used the same address to spend on the BTC chain so anyone miner could have taken them. There are still people who would need this service who have not broadcast the same address to the BTC chain thus their BCC will still be intact.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:43:21
Wait what? Can you buy and hold?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:11:48
Hmm. Sorry I'm not sure at all.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:13:31
This is not a scam, and the info he has asked to be provided can do nothing except verify the ownership of an address...  The coins are already recovered, he owns them. Whereas before this they were in limbo, stuck in a segwit address until the person who sent them broadcasted another tranaction to the blockchain thus giving a miner the information they needed to create a new transaction to spend the BCH. I think you might misunderstand, are you looking at a wallet and seeing your BCH or are you looking at the block it was mined in? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:55:24
Yeh i had been in contact with them prior to this fiasco. Unfortunately during the time it was taking to verify i was the owner etc. OP scooped up my "unspent" output. Hence there was no longer anything to recover.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:33:36
Any chance you could pick it up in a block soon, so i can, you know... sleep...  :D
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:11:32
So great news for you! If like me you spent BTC on the BTC chain with the same address you sent BCH to then contacting BTC.com will do nothing as u/bchsegwitrecover probably already has your coins. That's awesome that they recovered yours dude. Can you pm me who you dealt with? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:48:27
So many people in this thread and on other forums calling this theft. I don't get it, The nature of the BCH hard fork left mistakes like this bound to happen. We should be squaring the blame solely on the BCH devs. It's their fault they didn't prepare their coin to be separate from BTC in every way.  They were warned to change the address format so this could not happen yet they went ahead any way. 
They still argue about it on the BCH developer mailing list and every time it gets brought up as an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed it gets swept under the carpet. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:45:30
If you don't use the same BTC address on the BTC block chain, no one can claim it. Because when it was sent to the BTC address it did not have the segwit portion of the transaction with it because it was BCH. As soon as you use the same BTC address to receive some BTC you broadcast the segwit portion to the network. Thus making it possible for a miner to craft a transaction to claim those coins.  Which is what happened to me and the owners of 493 BCH coins :)
I also used a support ticket through bitmain but i didn't get a reply, scoial media is always a better way to get something done fast.
Good luck with it :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:39:06
So the problem there is trezor does not offer signed messages on segwit addresses, and i need to verify it was myself who sent BCC from an exchange to a segwit BTC address. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:07:18
Like if he was actually expecting it to ' replace bitcoin' as a long term investment wouldn't he just have bought already?  I know next to fuck all about crypto and this whole fiasco stinks like a fish market.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:17:47
The issue is, i cannot prove that i sent the BCC by accident to my BTC segwit address. For all the numbers tell us the input address could be anyones. I cannot sign the receiving address as the tx does not show up in any wallet. A cluster fuck to say the least.  You could argue that i have no way of knowing if someone sent me BCC via a BTC segwit address as it doesn't show up in any wallet, the only way to see it is to find the transaction on the block chain. Which i had been monitoring for the last few weeks and until yesterday the output of the BCC was unspent. u/bchsegwitrecover has now come along and spent all those outputs because everyone on that list spent BTC on the block chain from the same address they mistakenly sent BCH too. Thus making these unspent outputs available to spend as we broadcast our segwit portion of the TX to the BTC chain.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:30:14

I have a RPI3 myself that i bought as a xmas present (for myself) last year. I am a bit of a novice, but i have installed ubuntu on it a few months back, i've just never had a project that interested me. Do you think it's relatively straight forward to get a node running on one?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:05:15
What about the address you sent it to?
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:22:24
I'm going to assume the majority of new crypto buyers don't browse Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:04:03
I'm callin bullshit on that mate unless you can provide proof.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:11:20
the only way these coins were spent is because the private keys were used to spend coins after the mistaken transaction. Thus broadcasting the information needed to create a tx to spend these BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:34:55
Good to hear! that's 2 confirmed. To be fair it's not the fault of segwit, it's the fault of the BCH dev team for not listening to warning before the fork. Segwit operates smoothly with no issues on the BTC chain. The problem is that BCH decided NOT to change their address format when they decided NOT to adopt segwit, so now this mistake can happen as the addresses are indistinguishable from each other. You don't need to leave your BTC in legacy accounts. All you are doing is costing yourself more in fees when you want to move those coins. Don't buy into the drama that some of the BCH advocates create.  
edit: words
edit: also, there is only 12 days left and still over 480 BCH unrecovered. Largest amount in the pool is a whopping 80 BCH in one transaction. Will that person please stand up.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:06:55
This service will only work if you have not spent BTC on the BTC chain with the same address.  That's great that they're doing that.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:09:21
That is a guide for a non segwit address, the address they display has a 1 in it. Segwit addresses start with a 3, as do BCH non segwit addresses.
