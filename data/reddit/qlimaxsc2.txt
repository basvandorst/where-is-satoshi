sold 6 btc at $600 here, so mad.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:16:39
I've never seen this on bitcoinwisdom , does it mean anything?
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:11:38
I'm glad i deleted my account last week. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:50:01
This is going to be fun once they start selling those on other sites.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:43:48
What crash? 
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:46:41
Yes , most likely DDOS again.
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:38:27
Don't tell me you are actually planning on doing any trading on there what so ever? After having to wait 2 weeks myself , and getting rejected i had enough of the site. (and this was months ago)
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:49:38
I don't know , maybe on the link i added?
Also buy now , we are going up
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:45:46
I trade on kraken have noticed the website being unreachable quite a few times , can't be a coincidence.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:43:23
Those are people trading on GOX. It's not possible to get your fiat or your BTC out , making arbitrage between gox to another exchange impossible.

The meeting is now 
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:02:06
Didn't all the chinese sell in december?
Anyway i'm holding , last drop we went down to 878 and guess what , 3 days later we were back at 970
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:16:08
Great to see Kraken getting some attention , best trading site for EU imo.

Anyone can link whatever email they want to their skype (even multiple ones) , so it actually IS a fake account.
Either way BTC-e seems really shady , it's fine until you run into a problem.
@_date: 2014-01-20 09:26:58
What do you mean "in the game"?
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:36:12
Kraken/BTC-E for europeans. Coinbase for US
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:18:19
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:07:16
Goxxed once again?
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:09:17
Even the small exchange such as kraken are getting targeted. Sad to see this
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:21:31
Someone who obviously has access to your account , do you have 2FA?
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:40:33
Another panic sell due to arrests , get ready to buy.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:30:22
You can't get your bitcoins out either.
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:20:32
Not even that many , they had $250k bitcoin sales on the first day , which roughly (at $900) is about 277 BTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:12:50


It's price of bitcoin on Mt.Gox , the media is going to be posting the same bullshit everywhere..
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:26:15
I was fearing for the life of your keyboard and desk there
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:11:49
It has to be only a matter of time.. Right?
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:48:53
Don't worry , it's not like they can get your money out.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:18:07
I don't think it has reached the lowest point yet , but either way buying now will result in good profit in a few months or even weeks. Love the panic sell.
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:43:43
This. There are so many sites out there where you can purchase bitcoin safe and easy. Paypal is a piece of shit that you should always avoid using.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:47:27
Cool , if it happens maybe the big sites like MFC will follow.
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:28:19
As someone who bought at $450, i'm keeping my fingers crossed.
