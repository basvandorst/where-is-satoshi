As a windows user I have a habit of opening all files with specific applications unless I know they're safe and I'm working with them regularly. This comes from the day long ago I was working with some highly dangerous virus and my crap mouse accidentally clicked with its sticky button. Format... now my filetype associations are few and small.

Personally I am grateful in a way to the Catholics because it is largely because of them Latin is not completely dead as an official modern language.

As someone who knows Latin and not law sometimes I don't understand why legal terms are so extremely vague. It's almost like law people try to think of the smallest amount of information it's possible to convey the meaning with between those who already know what it is and leave everyone else as completely in the dark as if it were a secret code; I'm no nearer understanding the concept after reading its name than before.

I have read Dickens, and yet never heard of this, though Wikipedia calls it a greater work. I have just read the first page and am astonished; this is not the Dickens I know. This doesn't even read like a nineteenth-century novel, but as a twenty-first century one, with its fragments and ceaseless romantic imagery, even being Dickens. I have enough time, so I think I will read this; I have never before seen such a book.

 developers have successfully been able to disable the ME processor and entirely remove its firmware, rendering it inoperable, on some computers that use the Intel Mobile 4x series of chipsets (Penryn CPUs). They provide detailed instructions for how to accomplish this on those computers. Their software is also capable of simultaneously removing many other instances of closed-source code on the supported computers.

I've never had any problems with installers that attempt to fool the user while still technically allowing the installation of only the desired applicaton. Only true malware developed with the intent of outright lying about its functions has done this, in my experience, not this mere phishing that only harms those who let it. I use Windows, and while much of the software I use for personal and private applications is open source, I use some closed source software whose publishers I trust, including BitTorrent, the main client of the same company that owns uTorrent. While I think it a shame that so many closed source freewares try to be as tricky as possible in fooling the user into installing additional software, I have accepted it as a necessary evil, similarly to how if fools didn't click on phishing ads many websites might fail. I myself have never found the actual BitTorrent client to do anything outside what it is supposed to do and what it says it does (torrent torrents, seed, etc.) unless it sends information from my computer to an outside recipient that it is not supposed to at cleverly devised points I have not observed with network tools. These other programs, including the scandalous miner, are truly optional and the installer does indeed have (if very tiny) buttons to disable their installation and only install the client itself. I realize some people swear otherwise, but after hearing about this, testing it myself, seeing the epic scale offer hidden in the installer along with several other bits of spamware and declining them, and finding no miner on my filesystem after the installation I think I'll have to see it before I believe it. I am familiar with the response "oh, I can't have a virus, I didn't download anything!" when the user has clearly downloaded and installed many things, and I think this is merely the same situation happening to people who think they are immune to the phenomenon of unbelievably ignorace-bloated computer illiteracy. It's as simple as understanding exactly what you are doing when you are using a computer at all times; it takes a knowledge of how all parts of your computer's hardware and software work, but beyond that it's so simple and yet seemingly for so many people so impossible.

fusionism is great, but the recent libertarian-altright fusionism i've been noticing abundantly is drawing potential libertarian voters towards Trump, who is not libertarian for the same reason the alt-right idol who some libertarians like, Pinochet, is not - taking down a wall from the top by building a taller one and standing on it accomplishes nothing.
A lot of those people who supported Ron Paul are now becoming part of the alt right, the pseudofascist modern far right web movement that's giving Trump a majority of his online support. I beg all of them, to remember what libertarianism really is, and that the way to deal with social issues is not to use government to enforce the position. I beg all of them to remember that seizing the power from the enemy only makes you just like them, your own worst fear. Government authority is literally the Dark Side; you seize it to make everything your way, only to discover that your way is now the same as your predecessor's - it controls you. Ron Paul refuses to support Trump for a reason.
The social issues, the racism, etc. are all an illusion to try to get you to use government force to "fix" them. Think of this: _the extreme progressives, the enemy of the alt right, are doing literally the same thing_. They perceive the same issues the alt right does from the opposite side of the looking glass. They are twisted into thinking government is the solution as well. This is also applicable for normal right and left, Republicans and Democrats. Libertarians know, for the progressives _used_ to be libertarians, they used to be among us, once when, until long ago they fell into the same trap of obsession over social, cultural petty rivalry with people who thought differently, and the instinctive human tendency towards greater government drew them away as a result of this lowering of their eyes. I beg all of you who once called yourselves libertarians to remember the philosophical root of your beliefs and question how your petty partisan quixotic quest for essentially the same _social justice_ as your "liberal" rivals could blind you so much.

This shouldn't be necessary if one is capable of using applications to access the internet that he can prevent from sending identifying information to undesired places - i.e. not using cookies or other information-sending software or otherwise sending information that one has on his previous IP to undesired or untrustworthy IPs.
I typed with this condition assumed, since otherwise one would be moving to escape his nemesis but sending letters to him with his name on the return address - an utterly senseless move. Google is not Hogwarts; they cannot magically track you to a tiny shack surrounded by ocean in the middle of nowhere and bust your door in unless you tell them where you went.

That is, until your IP changes (one way or another). It's impossible for Google to know to ban an account for being you if you create it from a different IP. Google must abide by the laws of the internet just like everyone else; it is impossible to be permeanantly banned from **any** internet server if you can change your IP either by nicely emailing your ISP or by using a proxy or VPN.

i think that might be a little too broad a generalization - ex. if someone had blown the whistle to the public on the details of the US' atomic bomb work during WWII, would it have been a good situation that the Germans could get that info?

At my HS that would have been fine as long as you both told the teacher beforehand you were going to do this and gave another copy written normally so the teacher could grade it normally. A lot of deviant ideas were actually allowed at my school if you discussed it with your teacher beforehand. The general rule on how to follow the rules is that teachers don't like surprises; this goes for almost everything.

I like your ideas even better! It sounds like, because of all the blocks that can potentially be in a world, it would be better like that to have the server also say the lateral coords within 10 or so blocks of the sponge so that it doesn't take ages to find and plus a ton of people go there and PVP over it while trying to dig down to it at the same time. This is the point where I really wish someone would pop up and say "This is already a thing you know &lt;link&gt;".

YES there should be an official client mod and SMP server where you can literally mine bitcoins and they are uber-rare. The server is free to play on (as long as you have legit MC) but the cost is you must be mining in the official server bitcoin pool, and every time the pool gets a bitcoin instead of getting split up to the contributors a bitcoin ore gets spawned somewhere in the map. Then the one who gets it can put it in a chest with their bitcoin address on a sign on it and it would get put in their wallet. This would be really really awesome if it were popular.
