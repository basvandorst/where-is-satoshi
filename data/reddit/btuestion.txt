People have claimed Bitcoin is the one weird trick bankers hate to get rich quick over and over, who are you that your claim is any different than any other claim?
@_date: 2016-08-30 19:51:49
I mean, scam or not of course people here will tell you to buy, buying has a chance of you rising the value of their investment. They would tell you to buy even if that was contrary to your interests because it could help their interests.

Before the half in 74% of Bitcoin were handed out and now 76% are, there is more Bitcoin now than there ever were.
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:13:32
Nah, bitcoin is set up like a triangle of some sort. In the old days a few people could mine a lot cheaply. But after that the only way to get bitcoin was to buy it from those earlier people then make money by selling it to the next generation. 75% of bitcoin is already handed out and the last 25% is going to be over the next 100 years very slowly and only if you have huge amounts of computer power.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:13:21
Wouldn't that be a stimulus to a thing that had an actual positive interest rate? 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:36:04
Or we can just multiply the spot price by every token that has ever existed and pretend bitcoin is worth billions! Lets do that one because it makes bitcoin sound bigger and better!
@_date: 2016-08-23 22:23:48
I mean, gold was "handed out" over the course of like thousands of years to thousands and thousands of people spread across the world, a majority of bitcoin that will ever exist was handed out to a few hundred people in a few countries. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:40:37
Do you mean any sort of actual investigation with any sort of actual law enforcement or is this that bitcoin exchange thing where you internally investigate your own loss of investor money then throw up your hand and say "welp!" when it's all gone because it doesn't really matter to you. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 22:10:44
It's likely that almost literally every single bitcoin service is holding less bitcoin than they should be. There is almost no regulation and very little reason not to. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:15:20
I love that instead of doing this because you care about the victims you make sure to first sentence mention the goal of this is "good press" for bitcoin. Just a chance to use another tragedy to pump bitcoin and co-opt some advertising. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:49:30
You all got a 10% haircut though, price is down for users and others alike. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 19:26:19
Bitcoin would be better if the same people didn't work on bitcoin month after month and end up in political positions. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 19:50:46
If an open source project crows endlessly about how it's going to be the one world currency that runs the entire economy then that sounds really reasonable. 
If it's a tiny project that will only have a few hundred thousand users then yeah, that would be really dumb.

Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:38:39
Bitcoin! the currency where you can avoid 1% credit card fees by giving the user base 20% discounts! 
@_date: 2016-08-14 15:47:30
So this sure seems like a stimulus to an "IOU account" and not at all to bitcoin even a little bit. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:44:43
Greeks flocking to use Bitcoin after financial issues is just a marketing thing people try to pump Bitcoin, it's not real and the country barely uses Bitcoin.

Goal statement. first sentence.

Bitcoin security seems to be absolute garbage except nerds are convinced since private keys are secure that that is all they ever needed and making the rest bad is fine. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:58:45
so hacked the Bitcoin blockchain to give themselves 184 billion Bitcoin and it required removing 50 blocks of transactions to fix. Blockchains can be hacked as much as any software.

As someone who spends money before reading agreements then threatens legal action maybe Bitcoin isn't for you
@_date: 2016-08-31 01:04:57
75% of the bitcoin are handed out and that doesn't change no matter how you cut it up. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:56:57
In a market run by grownups you could maybe say that the low fees exchanges typically use is why they all cut corners and ultimately get robbed so easily and that a solid exchange simply needs to spend more. 
but in the crypto space you pretty much know that if something charges higher fees it's going to the exact same level of security and just into the wallets of the owners because why wouldn't they do that? 
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:09:53
The people that told you zero confirmations used to be safe were just lying to you to get them to buy you the bitcoins they were selling. That was never real. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 00:15:19
75+% of the bitcoin that will ever exist are already here, the rate of change is such the next 25% comes over the next hundred years. You might as well model bitcoin distribution as finished. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 19:24:08
You are asking people higher up on the pyramid that got in earlier if you should get into the scam later than them? Of course they will say yes.

Weird how people post this but never post that it was in a 120 page special issue of Newsweek entirely dedicated to how great the internet was. With this put on the second to last page as a tiny minority opinion.

According to  there is 11 bitcoin nodes in the entire country of greece. The whole idea that bitcoin is exploding in bitcoin is just a flat out lie that is constructed based on the delusion that if a country has economic issues that it will flock to whatever currency or commodity the person pumping is holding. If you go to any sort of scammy "investment" site it doesn't really matter what it is or how little it makes sense you will find posts about how greece is totally for real you guys gonna buy all the whatever and make all the readers rich quick working from home any day now and how it's the one weird trick bankers hate. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:36:11

How high are purse's fees that this is an economical amount to spend per customer? 
@_date: 2016-08-25 03:54:01
So you explained 15% discounts, how do you explain higher discounts. Also if this is so on the up and up why does no one offer this for real money?

The best part of this story is that not even you actually seems to have used it.

Currently in bitcoin world to give a guy a dollar you have to give 11% of that to like 3 chinese companies. Is that better? 
@_date: 2016-08-29 11:45:28
Why would bitcoin work better in this system then just a regular old token in the site's internal database? You can even have cryptography signing without block chains, if you want, satoshi didn't invent cryptography.

The source of snake oil?
@_date: 2016-08-26 15:56:21
It doesn't magically make transactions "trustless", etherium changed all sorts of rules and changed around all sorts of transactions after the fact. Bitcoin itself spawned 184 billion coins then had 12 hours of transactions removed. 
Nothing about it is 'trustless" or "immutable", the community can change it just whenever. Same as pretty much any protocol. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:16:02
In the glorious bitcoin future there will be no phone numbers to call, the blockchain has no call centers. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:08:30
so bitcoin is only 100% more expensive than the competition? But used by 10000% less people? 
@_date: 2016-08-15 15:16:14
Currencies don't even have market caps, It's just a way to lie and say bitcoin is big in a way it isn't. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 16:19:18
Interest has been pretty low. in 8 years there has been about 250 million transactions. Walmart alone does 250 million transactions in a week. And bitcoin transactions can be just simple things like a person putting their money in a new wallet or splitting it up or whatever, and some people make hundreds or thousands of transactions a day with just trivial amounts. So the real number is even lower. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:47:39
Step one: premake some addresses.
Step two: don't check them very often because you only make a few bitcoin sales. 
Step three: notice they got stolen because employees and family members had access and just moved everything out without you noticing. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 12:59:28
that seems extremely likely. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 03:04:01
Oh, are you yet another person that is all hyped up about bitcoin but hasn't even done very basic research into it's history? Congratulations. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:39:11
Stuff like this really shows it doesn't really matter if you keep your money in exchanges or not. Everyone's bitcoin go down with each sinking ship. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:11:46
Who cares, if you keep bitcoin in your own house they still lose value when someone else keeps it in an exchange. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 00:11:52
Bitcoin isn't really irrevocable.  The Devs have removed blocks before after glitches in the programming (the 184 billion bitcoin bug) and other blockchains running basically the same code have changed transactions after thefts. 
I would say that changing the blockchain is HARD and unlikely to happen often and requires a lot of community agreement but it's not really protected by the laws of physics or math or anything the way the encryption of individual transactions are. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 20:21:34
go read the actual tweets. They are pretty clear about the "child" of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:43:33
That is the weasel stuff, bitcoin people are so quick to claim that bitcoin is no better than cash when it's doing something unseemly but when it's law breaking bitcoiners agree with they will go on for pages about how superior bitcoin is. Which is it?

As a major developer on bitcoin do you really not understand the differences in use case of a credit card processor and bitcoin? Is that all bitcoin is to you? Is that something you design it with in mind of the range of use cases?
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:51:41
Absolutely they are. Being an architecture split into modules that different people run is absolutely the exact opposite of p2p. 
Has the bitcoin community just decided to redefine P2P as "not centralized"?

If you remove "chains" of transactions bitcoin transaction volume drops to only a few thousand a day, there is basically no activity outside of manufactured computer shuffling at this point. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:15:36
You are correct. bitcoin isn't really a rational choice and blockchains didn't really work as p2p money. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:20:07
Listen man, it either helps or it doesn't. You don't get it both ways. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:27:11
How does that help? If I have ten dollars in bitcoin I'm still going to have to make a transaction of ten dollars and pay the fee to get it into a microchannel and then pay another smaller fee for the microtransaction. 
That just hides the problem, it doesn't solve it. I still am making a bitcoin transaction and paying the fee to use a microchannel! It's just extra fees!
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:16:20
It's a fixed fee. If you buy something that costs 11 cents you pay a 100% fee. 
Actually 97% of bitcoin addresses now hold an unspendable amount because it costs more in fees to move the dust than the amount of money in the address.

It has 7.5 million users already and the blockchain can only handle 250,000 transactions a day. Meaning that even if we pumped blocks up to 10mb tomorrow (which is nearly impossible) it'd still take almost a week for each pokemon go user to even make one single transaction if we just shut off bitcoin for that week and only focused on only doing those transactions.
