Did you click a button twice? How dare you..

I'll let you know that and much more, tomorrow.

Can someone clarify if bitfinex is considering user balances individually and not in aggregate? This update indicates the former, but the funds were all accessible from the same set of keys so why are you hinting that you might honor withdrawals for accounts that were not affected? Or am I reading too much into this?

and then **Erik made the decision to conduct this trade in exchange for information with the hope of identifying the entry point of compromise**...
Does that make sense to anyone? Besides the obvious part where he knowingly trades something stolen from him, stop and think about this sudden "communication". The thief wants to trade at the same place he stole something from? Couldn't the guy go to poloniex and trade it there, or any other exchange?

bitwage's website should display in an obvious way the typical workflow for what they are doing, and considering they don't leads me to believe you'll get a terrible deal by using it.
1) Compared to other tickers, it seems bitwage's ticker add a 1% fee. They don't seem to list what is the actual fee they're adding there.
2) Take a US employer paying a Brazilian employee for $1000. The current official rate is $1 = R$3.59, and while your brazilian bank will give a different quote let's go with the assumption that someone transferring $1000 will net you R$3590 before fees. Even if bitwage is using this official BRL to USD rate, and even if didn't charge any hidden fees, you would fare much better by converting $1000 to BTC and then converting the BTC to BRL using a brazilian exchange. Checking brazilian bitcoin exchanges at this very moment will give you a 1 BTC = R$1700 therefore, assuming 1 BTC = $430, 1000 USD = 3952 BRL by using bitcoins (before fees).

Any performance improvements involving listunspent for wallets with tens of thousands of transactions?

The bitcoin blockchain is doing just fine, **blockchain.info though...

How does bcoin's utxo selection compares against bitcoin-core? If it's better, can you use bcoin only to create an utxo index and do coin selection based on that? Neat project.

What do you mean by more or less? It builds libbitcoind and the wrapper links to that.

Dark pool transactions are still accounted for the total BTC traded per day, and I'm using the highest fee level for all them. Are you sure the dark pool contributes to this? If it's possible to estimate any of those other incomes I'll gladly update the spreadsheet to include them.
Any suggestions?

One source I got for that was  That site says avg salary monthly for an engineer is 31,166 CNY = 4,909.66 USD. If there's a better source/estimation for it, I'm happy to update the spreadsheet.

If I'm understanding this correctly, bitcore is now just a package that includes other packages and does nearly nothing by itself. bitcore-node is the one that is important for this bitcore &lt;-&gt; bitcoin-core. 
bitcore-node seems to have developed a very useful patch that makes bitcoin-core compilable as a dynamic library. Does someone know if bitcoin-core is considering applying that patch upstream? This is very very useful, IMHO more so than any other parts that bitpay decided to hide in these bundles.

The source you linked to is not the important one, that's about node.js wrapping too (notice lots of async_). The one that matters is

I feel bad for you that this received so many negative responses, it seems all them can be answered by marking the API as beta and prone to changes...

Thank you, it's too automatic for me.
I get that this will download bitcoin-core v0.11.1, compile it with a patch and custom configure options from bitcore-node, link against the generated libbitcoind and use that to work with bitcoin-core structures.
After that I'm not sure I understand how this works. One of the reasons bitcoind has RPC calls (BTW, regarding this, before I was referring to the fact that Insight would use RPC calls to parse the local blockchain vs parsing the data directly for versions &gt; 0.9) is so it's possible to invoke calls from multiple processes and it will handle locking for me. Now, what happens in this bitcore-node where I have two JS processes using it? How is the locking handled? How does it communicate with the database? LevelDB is restricted to a single process.

That was fast. If you open the ethercalc link, the current estimation for Kraken is at $4.2k profit/day before any other expenses not included there.

The documentation website is beautiful but lacks all the important information. Someone more familiar with this package could help me understanding these: ?
1) Do I need to install and run bitcoind before running this, or this going to run the equivalent of bitcoind through node.js and do all the syncing and leveldb storage?
2) If I don't need to run bitcoind, which bitcoin-core version is included here? Insight used to not recognize bitcoind &lt; 0.10 storage and was forced to sync very slowly via rpc calls. Is this new bitcore (with bitcore-node) using the equivalent of bitcoind 0.9.x?
3) Bitpay recently announced they will be backing BIP 101 by December, does that mean this bitcoind wrapper can be modified by them to wrap bitcoind-xt?
@_date: 2015-10-22 18:03:44
Unless I misunderstand it (which is possible), it does not run bitcoind at all.
@_date: 2015-10-24 09:23:21
It's all included in "any suggestions".
How can I estimate any of those other incomes? Do you have estimates to contribute?
@_date: 2015-10-22 20:22:30
I'm not mentioning different threads, but different processes. How does bitcore-node coordinate access when multiple processes are using it to access the blocks and others stored in LevelDB? Is this documented somewhere?
@_date: 2015-10-22 18:01:16
I read that and it does not pass any confidence on using this besides a toy application. It does not give any detailed information about how it goes about linking with bitcoind and what it implements vs what it reuses from bitcoind. This is the harsh version of "lacks all important information".
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:07:55
Sure, that wasn't included there. Too bad this post and spreadsheet is never going to get traction here, maybe I should post something where everything is positive instead? :/
