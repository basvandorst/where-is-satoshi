Use localbitcoins bro. I brought my first .01 from a guy who turned out to work on the same campus as me in Hamilton NZ. Took a total of 1 hour from me clicking buy to the BTC appearing in my account.

I brought in at 250 two weeks ago, finally got them into my localbitcoins account just before and managed to sell at 750ish, as long as the buyer actually pays within the next 330 minutes.

I brought .01 a week ago just to play with. 
Wish I'd brought more now that it's nearly doubled.

This is great, thanks! I've just set up a wallet, exciting stuff!

Jesus christ it's like you're living in the fifties!
Actually, we used to have bingo Tuesdays at the pub like 3 years ago. Drinks were $2 each and every second round was basically free. I have no idea how that place stayed open but it was fucking amazing.

Aww thanks! Apology accepted :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:16:30
Did not know, cheers.

I'm pretty new to this: If you sell Bitcoin, do you voluntarily pay tax on the money you receive?
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:12:44
Thanks for the heads up bro!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:44:21
Shit, mildly NSFW!
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:19:10
Where are you buying beer? Can I come?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:24:24
So considering I brought in at around USD$250 two weeks ago, should I be selling now and then waiting till the inevitable crash to buy back in? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:44:29
Cheers for the heads up - I'll keep looking into it. The other option I was looking at was localbitcoins.com - it seems reasonably straightforward.
Either way, I'm only planning on investing $10 or so at this stage until I get he nag of things and learn more, so there isn't too much at stake.

I brought .08 two weeks ago and now the value has doubled.. I might just do that again once a month for a while.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:11:16
$100 for $1500 worth of work, you got a deal!

Shit, in New Zealand student loans are 0% and home loans range from 4-6%.
@_date: 2013-10-30 08:31:44
Seriously? You're game bro, I'm planning on spending $10 just to get my head around how everything works.
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:13:03
Is there a point that you could consider doing this? Like if you sold less than a few thousand dollars worth would you not? I personally like the idea of using the virtual visas in place of using cash for things and therefore skipping paying a bunch of tax.
I could buy clothes, get groceries delivered, and pay my Netflix subscriptions etc.

Either make an American hotdog or a proper sausage in bread. A Frankfurter looks wrong like that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:47:05
So basically once the payment clears for the coins I just sold, I should buy straight back in?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:48:57
I brought .01 the other day, turned around to my fiancee lats night and said "Hey, I just made $5 doing nothing!"
She wasn't as excited as I was.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:41:05
Did my aww make you think I was a girl, you creep?
@_date: 2013-11-01 01:28:02
Okey dokey. Cheers for the advice.
@_date: 2013-10-30 08:28:30
Any tips for doing it in NZ bro?
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:59:52
Imagine all this BTC that they seized just disappearing out from underneath them.
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:03:10
Seconded, set up my first wallet tonight!
