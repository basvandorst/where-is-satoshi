Internets a nasty place and can easily crush someones spirit. Might want to be a buffer between him and the reddit comments. 
Also, using his picture to sell mugs could backfire as reddit loves a good witch hunt, legit or not. 
I would actually take him out of the pictures since it seems like the parents are selling and just using the kid as a gimmick. Market it as a normal business and he can still handle the shipping and stuff.

You sound like your putting them down. Like they are dumb or something for not jumping in. If it improves your life then use it. If not then don't. Why does what other people do have anything to do with what you do.

You're only 17000 btc away, hold on.

Are there any concrete implications with this type of move? Is this somebody who most likely wants to get more bitcoin or are there a range of possible outcomes that this person could be seeking?

K kids, time to start paying us back.

To literally do something means to actually do it. So Ebay executives would actually have to start screaming that they want to be replaced by bitcoin. The mental image is great.
