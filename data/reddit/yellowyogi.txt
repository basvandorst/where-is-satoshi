I know it's called 'Bitcoin'chain, but it would be awesome if you added other cryptocurrencies as well. Especially Litecoin, that IMHO, analytically speaking, is getting tied to Bitcoin more and more.
Then it'll be a single nice, clean, accessible analytics place for me ;)

I can't tell you. Maybe they don't know that their keys are compromised and keep using the address.
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:47:21
Thanks :)

I'm glad you found relief. It ain't easy.
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:52:34
I would mine Litecoins for them, (CPU intensive) then just trade them for Bitcoins,

@_date: 2013-03-07 15:10:22
It depends where your private keys are. If in blockchain.info, any body would need to login in order to use them with or without your computer. If you're using the Bitcoin-qt client on your computer, that means, yes, anybody with access to your computer can take them.
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:21:38
I don't get it, is this sarcasm or are you sincere? Dude, this thing is working
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:11:13
I think this is kinda happening

@_date: 2013-03-15 15:22:48

you can bookmark them, a bookmark for each wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-14 16:05:48
Tremendous potential. 
This may make it comfortable for granny to adopt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:06:25
Just imagine how many new bitcoiners that btc could've generated. Such shame. 
Doing this to get on the miners' good side?
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:47:40
I went ballistic and tried a whole bunch of phrases. None of them were yours, but right now, there are 56 trax in the blockchain wallet that started for this. Holy cow!
this one is my favorite, 
seems like I wasn't the only one who found it, check out the public message.
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:18:06
