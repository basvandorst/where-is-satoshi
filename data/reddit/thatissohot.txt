I really like the concept that you have come out with and I would be happy to offer the domain for this. 
However I think the more difficult part is how should we move forward from here? How can we actually get the Bitcoin community to create such a site?

I really don't have any number in mind. 
A concrete offer I have from someone currently is $400 but lets wait and see - hopefully I don't have to sell and we can make something great for the community instead.

I think it is an OK idea (but maybe not great) and I would be willing to go that route if there would be someone who will create the site - I can provide hosting for free.

It is a nice and simple site you have there - how long has it been up?
What is the bigger goal and vision why you made it?

In LHV Bank it is free.
In other Estonian banks there is a small fee (up to 0.38 EUR)
