Thanks for this! I've had a transaction unconfirmed for about 4 days now at 250 sat/byte and I'm hoping the fees will get down to that range again soon.

Not saying he's right, but he meant to say BTC is worth 10% of gold.

Super unhelpful comment. Why even comment at all?

If Bitcoin is worth a million the USD will be worth almost nothing in comparison... your new best currency would be Bitcoin and you'll have a retirement fund of it already.

I like you.

You didn't reply to anyone. You started a new comment thread.

How is Bitcoin supposed to succeed if there's not mass adoption? Did you expect that only the passionate and knowledgeable people to use it forever? What you're talking about is kind of inevitable... Most you can do is educate people about it.

Thank you for the detailed response! I’m with you on wishing I went to community college instead of taking out loans. 
I will probably have to wait till I’m at least 30 to have kids so I’m trying to maximize my financial gains before then. Great insights!

Very well said! I’m still new so the measuring system confuses me sometimes.

I disagree. I have been thinking we are going to start seeing the hyperinflation of fiat money happening if it hasn't started already. The system wasn't doing itself any favors BEFORE crypto was introduced. I think you are right in that currently more people trust the USD over crypto but I think that is changing rapidly.

I'm still figuring out what I'm going to do myself.. but isn't this comment correct? Couldn't you just say you transferred all of your coins out to other people as gifts? Or you lost them? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:12:48
That's not how it works. If the IRS finds an issue with your return, they will make you put in the work to prove that your original return was correct or leave it up to you to correct it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:47
Personal question but... would you have had fewer kids?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:38:28
I have a transaction unconfirmed for over 48 hours that was 241 sat/byte. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:04:25
You would be surprised how many folks still need this advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:30:31
You're funny :) Happy Cake Day!!

Won't we just change the way we measure bitcoins ? Like instead of trading full Bitcoins we will be trading "Satoshis"? So in the future you would get 10 Satoshi for every USD, which means the people that owed full Bitcoins early on are now going to have millions of Satoshi in savings.

I said fuck it and bought in at 11k and I am not mad at all. This market is crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:31:41
Haha you sound like a seasoned veteran.. crazy that it's only been a little more than a week.
