I was also looking over r/BTC today, and they said some stuff about LN that worried me. Apparently, LN won't work with full blocks. And the original LN white paper called for 133MB blocks.

What makes you think it's 17 characters? Is that just a completely wild guess? Or do you have some evidence that it's 16 characters?
And why two e's?

Nobody's cracked it yet, but i can feel we're getting close. We're making progress, and I just wanted to update you.  Brute force lowercase a-z, minus "uninteresting" characters, no spaces or numbers is the way to go. I'm almost 100% certain someone with enough computing power will find the password using this method. 
 Only unknown variable is which lowercase letters to include.  If you're using btcrecover, please put this in your token file:
    ^%[abcdefiklmnorstuwy]
    ^2^%[abcdefiklmnorstuwy]
    ^3^%[abcdefiklmnorstuwy]

    15$
The 15$ at the end is just to check if I added 15 at the end (the ONLY number I would ever add to the end.) Add as many lines as you think there are digits (probably 9-12), remembering to change the number of the line in the beginning, and change the group of letters that you think might be included in the pw.  THE LESS LETTERS YOU INCLUDE, THE GREATER THE LENGTH YOU CAN CHECK.  Please remember to add the tags "--no-eta" and  "--no-dupchecks" so you don't run out of memory.  Unfortunately my machine can only do 600kP/s, so I can't find it myself, but someone with access to a lot of servers can probably find the password very quickly!!!

It's not one or the other. I think I can hire someone to do it for much less - leas than 0.5BTC even. But before I ask the professionals for help, I thought it would be fun to give the Reddit community the chance. There are a lot of smart people on r/Bitcoin, and if anyone can do it, it's one of you guys. This community has given me so much over the years, and for that I'm very grateful.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:09:32
Why do they have much more of an interest in lowering the price than raising it?
I would think it would be the other way around. (if you short something, and it goes down to 0, you stand to make 100%, but if you buy it and it goes up, you can make an infinite amount of money, theoretically... right? I'm not a finance guy, that's just my understanding)

PM me if you're concerned, I can send you screenshots and proof that I set up this wallet back in 2015.  And some random words came into my head at the time, and two years later I forgot them.  How the hell am I supposed to narrow it down?  i tried every password I've ever used already, but I already knew it was something random.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:23:20
Yes, I've verified it works - have ran wallets with known passwords through this extract script and it worked
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:02:59
It sucks, you have no idea
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:09:25
I'm positive.  Set a password and used encryption.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:29:54
I backtracked and realized I must have entered this password at least three times (once to create it, and twice when I sent a small amount of coins from the wallet the day I created it on 8/4/2015).  So its not like that (I would've remembered if it were like that)
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:41:15
Let me be clear about this - this is a great opportunity for someone who cracks wallet passwords using John The Ripper or btcrecover.  I'm expecting whoever's posting passwords to actually find it, using password-cracking methods, like dictionary attacks or brute force.  Please verify that the password works against the partial-MPK before posting (I have to manually check all these, after all)
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:10:54
You don't - you get the *encrypted* MPK

Read my instructions - I gave out the partial encrypted master private key, which you can use to check passwords against. It won't allow you to unlock the whole wallet, but it will allow you to at least test whether a password works or not. I would NEVER send the actual wallet to anyone, ever, and luckily there's no need to.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:17:04
How do you even have a 64-core machine? Isn't the largest Intel extreme CPU only like 22 cores? Even with dual cpu's that's only 44 cores... 
Whatever you have, when I unlock this wallet I'm going to build myself one.

I just discovered something that may be important.  I know I downloaded Electrum on August 8th, 2015, at ~4am EST.  I'm guessing whatever version was live on their site is the one I downloaded.
HOWEVER, I'm looking at my Downloads folder now on the same machine I originally used, and there's a file here - electrum-2.3.2-setup.exe, with a Date Modified, Date Created, and Date Accessed of August 12, 2015.  So four days later.  Maybe I downloaded it four days later so I could transfer it to my laptop?  I have no idea.  Why is it 2.3.2?  Everyone is telling me the latest version on Aug. 4th 2015 was 2.4.1.  Could my wallet have been destroyed/corrupted if I did download 2.4.1 originally and then downgraded to 2.3.2?
Is there a way (maybe by looking at the registry or something) to see the history of Electrum versions I installed on this machine?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:58:11
I'd like to give r/Bitcoin a chance before I ask the professionals. Who knows, it could be an incredibly simple, stupid password, and I'd love to give some random redditor the opportunity to make 0.5 BTC. This community has given me a lot over the years... the least I can do is give them first dibs on this opportunity.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:56:22
A few people, yes
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:10:22
I honestly don't know. My guess would be ends in 15 OR a special character. But who knows, maybe I ended it in 15 and then added a special character so the complexity-meter would go from yellow to green (strong). I don't know what I wrote, that's the problem.
If I were creating an Electrum wallet for the first time, I would keep typing shit until it said "strong". I'm 98% confident of that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:33:54
I am a man of my word. I've been a redditor for 6+ years, and I'm offering this challenge under my actual Reddit account, not a throwaway. I have every intention of sending 0.5BTC (less than 1/20th of the wallet) to whoever sends me the correct password first. If you crack the password, and are still skeptical, pm me and I'll do whatever I can to guarantee that the time and effort you put into this project is not wasted. I will not waste your time - I am 100% serious - if/when someone finds the correct pass, you will all be able to verify via the blockchain that 0.5BTC is sent from the address I posted above to your or whomever's address. I will post a link to the transaction for all to see when the password is found.

Some good people are working on it, and they seem to be feeling good about the possibility of cracking it.  Already had two SCAMMERS - one that sent me a photo trying to make me think he had co-opted my wallet, and has control of the coins, and is asking me to send him 0.5BTC to unlock them, and another guy who photoshopped the btcrecover-master output, acting like he found the password (which he didn't because he made some critical errors in the image), and he's asking me to send him 1.5 BTC -BEFORE- he tells me what the password is.  Luckily i'm extremely savvy when it comes to scams, but dang, there are a lot of scammers out there.  And they all come out late at night, when the USA is asleep!
They're the ones saying "I found it - PM me"
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:13:05
Because I'm not sending anyone the actual wallet, just a piece of the master private key that they can use to test passwords against. Even with the correct password, the partial MPK is useless because it's incomplete
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:49:00

I realized 15 doesn't add enough complexity. And I mean to say if there is a number, the only number I would write would be 15. Now I'm realizing it probably just ends in a special character. Usually my default special character is !, but it could technically be any special character easily accessible with or without holding down Shift on a standard US keyboard.

possibly two random letters at the end. possibly "btc".  But other than that, it should be two (or three) words, POSSIBLY ending in two letters, but probably its just two (or three) words.
The words are likely stuff I had lying around me at the time, auralex, acer, logitech, yamaha, etc. brand names and stuff

Read my post carefully - I created this walled on 8/4/2015.  I stupidly sent 10.5BTC to it on 10/22/2016.  You don't need the password to send coins TO a wallet - only to send them FROM a wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-09 22:00:54
Try just a-z lowercase, no numbers, no spaces, and leave out z and q.  i truly think the password consists of simply lowercase letters. a-z. Maybe even remove stupid letters like q and z to make it go even faster. I almost NEVER use spaces in passwords. It just feels so unnatural. So thats 24 possibly characters, to the power of however many digits there is. I truly think whoever solve this thing is going to just get it by brute forcing lowercase a-z.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:19:30
I likely used no numbers. I think the best shot you have at cracking it is just lowercase letters a-z. Maybe even get rid of silly letters like q and z to speed things up even more.
I honesty think whoever cracks it is going to just be doing a-z on a big server farm and go as deep as possible.
Another thing is btcrecover is written in Python and is very slow. John the Ripper is many orders of magnitude faster. Someone using JTR brute forcing a-z probably has the best chance of finding it in the shortest amount of time.

When you create a wallet, and also later when its open, you have the ability to choose to encrypt the wallet, and also to encrypt the wallet FILE seperately.  I only chose to password-protect the wallet, which encrypts the xprv and seed, but doesn't encrypt the wallet file itself.  So I can open the wallet file in Electrum, but I can't spend the coins in there without the pw or seed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:54:17
Here's what I know for sure.
Ends with a special character (! ' \ ~ probably one of those, or something else on a regular US keyboard)
Consists of lowercase a-z
Max 16 characters
Starts with "e" (I'm 70% on this"
And the last hint is that it is indeed a stupid password, but it said "weak" when I made it, so I added another special character at the end so it would say "strong" in green text right below the password input box when you create the password with the new-wallet-creation wizard.
Hopefully these hints help!
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:11:44
Thanks! Me too
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:32:52
THIS is good thinking.  I know that at one point I had to copy and paste the seed down somewhere when I first created the wallet (electrum's wallet creation wizard makes you do that).  I checked all my stickynotes, on both my PC and laptop, checked all text/word/rtf files from that week in 2015, and thats about all i could think of.  I also looked through places where I normally keep stuff like this (thumb drives and such).
Does anyone know of an easy way to search for a seed on your computer? As in search for 12 words separated by spaces, all that being surrounded by nothing, or line/paragraph breaks?

I've been asking individuals for help here and there, but I'm asking the entire Reddit community now becusse of the meteoric rise in price from the last few weeks. Now the price is so high, that I can offer a decent reward amount and that will mean a huge amount of money for whoever finds it. But for the past year, I spent the first few months on and off using btcrecover to find it myself, then last month I finally started reaching out to people on the Bitcoin irc chat, and just a few days ago I posted the Reddit post I've been thinking about making for months.
My passwords are complex. But they're hard to come up with - I have 3 or 4 I use regularly, that all use lowercase and capital letters, numbers, and special characters. I already tried these 3-4 tough passwords, in every possible combination. I'm pretty confident I didn't use one of these. Like 95% confident. I've found other wallets I created around August and September 2015, and the passwords I used there were "testtesttest" and the other one I posted. Stupid passwords.
I don't just make up passwords with super high complexity. If I wanted a super high complexity password, well I already have 4 of those, and I'll use one of them. I did not do that in this case.
Rather, I made up some dumb password, but it said "weak" below the password box. So I added a special character to make it "strong".
I think it starts with an "e" because I know that at one point, I made a password with the word electrum in it - I'm not sure if it was Electrumwalletpw or electrumpw or something else, but I know all the other passwords to my other wallets from that year, and none of them start with "electrum", so maybe this is the one. I vaguely remember making a password with the word "elephant" in it as well. You should replace the e with electrum and try that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:14:56
I probably did.  The only problem is, I got a new phone shortly there after, and there is a gap of a month or two in 2015 where i'm missing all my photos from that time period because I didn't back up my phone.  So I don't have any photos from that date (trust me, i looked.)
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:05:27
I must've typed in the password a few times.  I typed it in once at when I first created it on 8/4/2015 sometime between 4:09am and 4:38am EST.  Then I sent coins to it.  Then I sent coins FROM it, requiring me to type the password again at 5:01am.  Finally, I sent some more coins out of the wallet at 5:24am, requiring me to type in the password AGAIN.
So I typed it a total of three times that night.  It was probably a simple password.
Also, this was all done a full year before I stupidly sent 10.5 BTC to this wallet, that I had forgotten the password for.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:36:59
Yes, I did that, and it did correctly say that the password for that wallet was "testtesttest"
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:22:35
This ain't a fully encrypted wallet - only the keys and seed are encrypted. If the wallet file were fully encrypted I wouldn't even be able to open it at all (now I can open it, but can't spend the keys)

I've heard about him, but I hear he charges 20%. That's fine for smaller wallets, but this is a $150,000 wallet... I ain't paying $30,000, not in a million years. I'd rather sit on it for another few decades until quantum computers come out that can crack it in 2 seconds
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:38:00
If someone actually finds the password, they should PM me and we'll work it out.  And as for your second comment, you're right, 0.50 for a 10.5BTC wallet is not that much, and thats why I have no problem offering it as the reward.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:58:01
Do you guys use btcrecover or John the Ripper? Also, because of the size of the wallet, I'm offering 0.5BTC.  I can't do any better than that, but I can give you a great testimonial.  Also, you can put a link up on your website to this page, so your customers can see that you really helped somebody that no-one else could.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:51:52
I truly think the password consists of simply lowercase letters. a-z. Maybe even remove stupid letters like q and z to make it go even faster. I almost NEVER use spaces in passwords. It just feels so unnatural. So thats 24 possibly characters, to the power of however many digits there is. I truly think whoever solve this thing is going to just get it by brute forcing lowercase a-z.

It's probably not one word, but two-three words. Can you try combining dictionary words?

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:00
Holy shit, great find! As I said, even if you didn't actually find the password, if you find a way for me to open the wallet then I will send you the reward.

Lots of bullshit answers for sure, but there are some people taking it seriously and offering to help crack it.  Hopefully one of them does!
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:22:17
I don't think I'd use just one word. I probably used 2 words (or three, but more likely two). I know this increases the amount of time it takes by quite a lot, but there's a really good chance the password is two words, so I think you should try to set that up somehow. Please let me know how you make out!
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:34:31
incorrect lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:38:38
A while ago, but nobody really saw the post - r/Bitcoin is a must larger community
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:40:07
PLEASE try just lowercase letters (a-z).  i think there's a very strong chance that the password is just 2-3 words, composed of lowercase letters.  You can even leave out silly letters like z, q to make it go even faster.
Please let me know how many digits deep you get with only testing a-z lowercase!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:56:52
Thank you, me too!

I just edited the post again and added proof. When I created the wallet on 8/4/2015, I sent coins directly from my Coinbase account into the wallet. I've added screenshots from my Coinbase account showing that I sent money to one of the wallet's addresses, and snapshots of the wallet as I see it now, containing the same address. This is my wallet, I didn't steal it, I really am a moron for sending coins to a wallet I didn't realize was password-protected.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:05:39
You don't need the full wallet file to check passwords, only the part of the file that contains a PART of the password hash.  Here's how btcrecover's documentation describes it:
"An Electrum 2.x encrypted master private key (mpk) is 128 bytes long. It contains a 16-byte AES initialization vector, followed by 112 bytes of encrypted mpk data, with the last byte being padding (so 111 bytes of actual mpk data). Of these 111 bytes, roughly 18 comprise a header, the next 44 the chaincode, and the remaining 47 a private key. The script extracts the 16-byte initialization vector and just the first 16 bytes of mpk data, all of it non-sensitive header information.
Once decrypted, these 16 characters always begin with the string "xprv", and the remainder are base58 encoded, *btcrecover* can use them alone to check passwords. It tries decrypting the bytes with each password, and once the result is what's inspected, it has found the correct password.
Without access to the rest of your wallet file, it is impossible the decrypted header information could ever lead to a loss of funds."

I sold a ton of BTC in eBay in the US for a while around a year ago, until eBay started shutting down my listings. I see they're allowing them again...
So many scam artists buying bit coins and then claiming their accounts were hacked - and of course there's no way to reverse the bitcoin transaction, but they reversed the paypal transaction alright.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:10:56
Already tried all those obvious Electrum/Bitcoin-related works with digits 0-99 added to the end using password-cracking software. I need someone to try a dictionary attack, which I don't know how to do.

This site looks a little shady... no contact address, no name... before I hand this wallet over to anyone, they're signing an ironclad escrow agreement.

No, definitely didn't copy the password from anywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:19:29
Well, they tell you to put in a sentence/phrase, so I likely entered an amalgam of passwords and/or phrases

Seems like it would give more power to miners. The whole New York Agreement, with their language "Bitcoin is whichever chain has the most hashpower", just seems like a sleezy power-grab by corporate interests and huge mining contingents... I probably don't have the whole picture, but I think I have enough to know that this whole thing is not just about block size, but about the control of Bitcoin.

I agree - yes, most veterans will hold on and ride it out, but the number of MtGox users has increased from 1,000 to over 100,000 users, mostly in the past few days/weeks.  Bitcoin has been exploding lately... and I think many of these newbs will freak and sell off as soon as MtGox comes back online.  I think it depends on how much longer MtGox remains down for - the longer MtGox stays down, the less reliable it appears.  Earlier today we saw a 1.5hr shutdown that didn't affect the market, but I imagine that if this crap continues into tonight and tomorrow morning we may wake up to a huge sell-off.
@_date: 2011-06-12 19:04:42
I have a very strong suspicion that it's going to be down for several hours more, maybe even all day.  Definitely way longer than earlier today.

I sold at 1120, then watched it rally up to 1280. I figured hey, it'll go back down.. and it did, to 900, and then shot up again to 1200+ (I missed my chance, essentially.)
Now we're at 1600-1700. Should I hope and pray for another dip, that may or may not come? And if it does, will it be significant enough for me to even notice? Will I Time the bottom right?
Or should I just buy now at 1700?
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:38:12
Took your advice and got in at 1720 during yesterday's sudden drop. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:25:05
If it shoots down to 1100, I'd feel a lot worse than I'd feel great if it shoots up to 2300.

I'm submitting this because nobody seems to know what Coinbase will do with their Bitcoin Cash (BCC), and although I keep seeing their emails/blog posts on r/bitcoin, I haven't seen this Support Article.
So here it is, straight from the horse's mouth.  According to Coinbase, they either won't interact with the new chain at all, or if they eventually do, they'll allow customers to withdraw those coins.
I personally think that if these BCC coins were worth anything at all, it would be an insanely dick move for Coinbase to steal them from their own customers and keep them for themselves, and the effects of the loss of customer's trust they would experience would be devastating.  It would be extremely bad business, and from then on, people would think twice about using Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:07:48
Ok thanks. A lot of people on here were saying that BTC was gonna crash slightly when the fork happens... do you think that might still happen? If I have money in AJ exchange, should I leave it alone? Or should I sell it for USD, and re-buy after the price recovers?

its acting super buggy right now... wtf?

Yeah thats my plan as of now.  'Tis a shame though.... I'll miss out on the combined value of having currency on both chains, which might be the best way to go ultimately.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:12:58
I think I'm fucked.  Coins are in Coinbase, and I have a $10,000 daily withdrawal limit like most people, and more than $10,000 x [number of days till Aug 1st], so I'm not going to be able to withdraw all of it in time.
I could try applying for an increase, but they say it takes four business days, so I'm still fucked.
I think my only option is to sell, and re-buy after August 1st when the markets open up again.  But at that point, the price might be a lot higher, and i'll miss out on the appreciation.

Does this mean the UAHF will still activate on Aug 1st? And perchance do you have any idea if the UAHF will definitely create "two bitcoins"?  I.e., if I have coins on one blockchain right now, after Aug 1st will those coins exist on two blockchains?  The regular one and the UAHF one&gt;
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:32:07
Ok, I'm likely gonna move half my coins into cold storage. But what's so bad about coinbase? Yeah they said they might suspend withdrawals and deposits around August 1st, but I intend to hold for years... and they also had a problem with paying super high transaction fees, but that appears to have been fixed... why else? I've used them for years and never had a problem.

@_date: 2013-03-28 07:49:35
I'm thinking about doing the same, but I'm worried about liquidity. I.E., if the market starts to crash, how quickly could I get the coins back into MtGox so I can sell them? Doesn't it take something like 6 hours for a transaction to confirm? Keeping them in MtGox means I'll be able to sell instantly should the need arise.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:14:01
