It's more like a fiat than Bitcoin. Fiat that's controlled solely by Vitalik. He can change it as he likes. But  if you like the tech, better have a look at Ethereum classic. It's original branch and is not controlled by Vitalik hence less centralized.
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:50:53
Eth is a joke, Vitalik's toy.  If you are for the tech, stick to ETC.

I'm looking for some sollution to implement such scenario:
I give my relatives some parrole or key, but when they apply it, nevertheless they should wait for 3-6 month for funds be released to them. And I will be able to update the key every 3-6 month and give them new version of the key. So they can't take the funds if I'm still alive because I update the key before the released term expires, but if I die they can use the last key given to them and take the funds when 6 months expires.
any suggestions?
I think Core node wallet or some hardware wallet can implement the possibility to use second parole that can release funds after bitcoin blockchain reaches specific block height. And that second parole we can give to our relatives whereas using general parole for immediate access to the funds

It's advisable for you reading Bitcoin Standard part about altcoins. Sorry but if someone don't understand it yourself and needs explanation, testifies about low intellect.

Shitcoins are also cryptocurrencies. 'Crypto' is a term widely used and loved by shitcoiners that like to place their particular shitcoin next to bitcoin in their utterance and to generalize them with 'crypto', to create a feeling that they are the same and trick newbs and retards. Nowadays some retards even using 'HODL' and 'to the moon' in reference to shitcoins, though originally it refers only to Bitcoin and everyone knew that shitcoins is only for short-term day-trading for pumping and dumping.
It's like dollar is paper. And toilet paper is also papper but you don't generalize them with word 'paper' because they are not the same. Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin also are not the same.
Even shitcoiners feell it. If you visit r/cryptocurrency you'll find out that all topics bashing bitcon is highly upvoted there. But all topics praising or highliting positive Bitcoin news or improvements are marked and deleted as irrelevant. Whereas with shitcoins the situation is opposite.
Shitcoiners succeeded in propagating 'crypto' implying Bitcoin and shitcoins at once. So doesn't matter wheather you say 'crypto' implying only Bitcoin, because you only help shitcoiners in their false narrative.  This is why solid bitcoiners don't like and avoid using 'crypto' 'cryptocurrency' 'blockchains'.

@_date: 2019-12-24 11:24:52
Impossible. For a shitcoin (any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) to gain traction it needs huge advertising publicity and promotion which implies central leader or group. And it renders that shitcoin complete centralized manure no better than fiat.  We can see that in Eth and ripple.  It's enough to bump off it's creator to extinguish it. Imagine what happens with Eth if  s/o snubs out Vitalik.
But if you try to create a shitcoin and dissapear like Satoshi, nobody knows about your shitcoin and it can't gain traction.

All useful and  worthy developments on altcoin can be adopted by Bitcoin.  Like now with DAO maker and sidechains (eth becomes  unnecessary)
If you clone altcoin ETH you clone every development of those developers right? And you don't have to convince those developers to contribute to your altcoin. So development means nothing if you developing shitcoin.
So every development on every shitcoin can be copied by all other shitcoins and be adopted by Bitcoin. And again we have infinite shitcoins which don't make sense.
All decent developers work on Bitcoin. Shitcoin developers just want to become rich subsequently dumping their bags on retards.

for example vitalium centralized not only because it was 70% premained and controlled by Vitalik but also because it's data already several Tbs and no1 can allow full node except few big entities

they are not hodlers, just regular crap holders, HODL doesn't refer to alts

Maybe "to Charlies through Bob" is correct?

May be you are new to Bitcoin, but correct form is bitcoins for plural. Begin studying original site bitcoin.org.

Alts almost are not being used hence low income in fees for miners.  And that doesn't speak favorably for alts
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:37:05
In these latter days many start to forget that all shitcoins were created only to shake down bitcoins from weak hands and dough heads

It's to split bcash from bitcoins, and then split ABCcash and SVcash and then dump both crap for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:48:31
Ho Ho I managed to dump all bcash before bitmain massacre
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:54:07
I basically telling you that you are wrong
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:25:35
yummy bear
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:56:44
who cares about your shitcoins
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:09:30
I was banned by this wanker for "impersonating other users" though I've never pretended to be him. But when he tries to pass bcash off as Bitcoin  it's ok

There are infinite number of altcoins so in the long run they won't cost anything. Whereas there's only 21 mln bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:30:22
That's not how capitallization works. Imagine no1 want to sell their bitcoin and only 1 btc is trading the exchanges and there are millionaires who are desperate to possess one, they gave millions to have it and we will have bitcoin sold for several millions $.
That's how shitcoin capitalization works, Eth for example already has  &gt; 100 mln  coin supply and in fact unlimited  and should cost nothing, but is traded for 300 $. Because it was premined and is given out in small amount to silly shitcoiners

Great Purge (due to halving, Satoshi was a genius)
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:24:08
Right, my rule never leave more than .1 Bitcoin on any exchange
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:56:43
You lied in title you didn't buy Bitcoin, but shitcoins, those who invest/supports shitcoins are foes to Bitcoin. 
And Bitcoin's foes must suffer
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:55:05
Are you newbies? Both of you are wrong. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:45:49
Nothing new. First thing newbie in Bitcoin must learn is that all alts are created eventually just to take away bitcoins from weak hands of fools.
Second: If somebody says otherwise it's just because he wants to sell you his bags of shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:05:08
bcash SV and ABC, Ethereumcoin are just alts like many others before them. To have value something needs limited supply, but there can be unlimited ammout of alts so all of them are scam and dust
@_date: 2018-12-03 10:35:02
Bitcoin will be 25k soon, Even Santa can't drop bitcoin price so much by christmass
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:46:46
he was wrong, he just bought some alts, ehterium is just another useless altcoin
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:55:53
It was a great trap for fools, altcoins were created to collect money from fools who don't trust and invest in Bitcoin directly. It's natural selection, fools can not be millionaires because it'd create chaos in the world
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:43:40
He's shitcoiner
