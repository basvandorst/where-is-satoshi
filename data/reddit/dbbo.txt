Bitcoin might help, but most people aren't going to convert large chunks of their income to BTC because it's too volatile to justify (and you should only invest what you can afford to lose). Seeing your "checking account" fluctuate by 5-10% in a day would probably freak most people out.

From his perspective I'm pretty sure it was $10k in BitCoin and $0 in resources.

I think giving someone your business solely because they accept bitcoin a bit rash.

The "+ Linux" part is key. Without a kernel it is *not* an OS.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:26:28
My "confusion" is why they defined BusyBox as a Linux distro instead of saying "a reference to a set of UNIX utilities commonly used in conjunction with a Linux or BSD kernel as a minimal operating system on embedded devices and routers". 
Just because two things are *mentioned* in a sentence doesn't mean their relationship is expressed correctly. Can't believe I actually have to point that out.
@_date: 2014-06-20 07:48:38
Are you suggesting that people who are denied a bank account would be more likely to accept volatility in their main source of spending money? Seems unlikely, but if that's not your point then I don't see what your comment has to with mine.
@_date: 2014-02-08 11:02:44


Maybe so. I would be willing to consider other payment options but I wouldn't consider anything that would take longer.


I do not believe that sending in a physical copy of a government issued photo idea is reasonable. I think standard user/pass + mobile TFA is fine.

Another thing, I would want to see some more starting code, or at least an algorithm layout and a TODO. Something technical to demonstrate the direction of the project.
The entire wetube GitHub account (which is host to the project) doesn't appear to contain any actual code aside from this ["early draft"]( It seems to be almost entirely a list of class definitions straight out of a hunchentoot tutorial and not much else. It doesn't show me what direction the development is heading in. (As an aside, I'm not sure why Lisp, or any functional language, would be the go-to choice here- not that it's wrong, but it could use some clarification in the manifesto.)
This concerns me for a few reasons. 
First, I have to wonder if the project owner is an "idea man" who doesn't have much programming experience, and second, if he is looking for some developers to do most of the leg work while he calls the shots. If either of these are true, why should programmers join this project rather than starting their own?
It may sound cynical, but this sort of thing does happen in the tech startup/FOSS world.
Let's say I'm wrong and the owner is a programming expert. What does he need from other programmers? I'm back to my point about not seeing the future of development. The post says to email them to learn more, so I may be shut up soon.

Absolutely not. Accordingly I have to reject your following arguments.
To me, an operating system in the technical sense is strictly the kernel, firmware, device drivers, *and* basic utilities/libraries that are widely depended upon by application programs. Whether the application programs themselves (such as a DE) are part of the operating system is debatable and depends on the definition. In the most technical sense, they aren't; the OS is simply everything *between* the hardware and applications.


I can agree with that, but it doesn't make the article any less wrong from a technical standpoint.

Thanks, but this method leaves noticeable artifacts: 
I was looking for the original which would have transparent anti-aliasing rather than slightly-tinges white pixels (which stick around, and cutting them out will severely hurt the circle's smoothness).

In this case when I say "individual" I mean the average internet user.
It would be absurd to say that what's good for AT&amp;T is good for everyone just because AT&amp;T is a group of people.

You seem to be really good at arguing against comments you haven't actually read.
I said BUSYBOX ITSELF IS NOT AN OPERATING SYSTEM. I did *not* say anything about Linux + BusyBox not being one.

If you want to get technical, the volume of BTC transactions (indicated by the bars) has decreased, and the area of the bars has decreased. Their volume is presumably zero across the board.

@_date: 2014-06-19 18:51:40


I know this is a minor point, but that's not at all what BusyBox is. BusyBox is a bunch of commonly used UNIX-like utilities (such as `ls`, `cp`, etc.) combined into a single executable. It is NOT an operating system and is not connected to the Linux kernel, though it is frequently used on top of it.

But if the government is borrowing money from a central bank with interest in order to supply the money pool, there's no security for the currency's value! It will be perpetually inflated and the debt will continuously increase!
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:19:23
I did not say Linux is an operating system. In fact, I explicitly said "the Linux kernel".
And busybox isn't an entire userland (what I assume you meant by "OS base") either.

The article says that he was handed down several concurrent sentences, two of which were life. I would really like to know specifically what charges brought those two, especially since he was ever charged with attempted murder. One of them might be "maintaining an ongoing criminal enterprise", which (to me) seems unbefitting to have even charged him with in the first place.

From an investor's perspective, I think this is accurate. 
However, from a currency user's perspective, China seems desperate to support the Yuan and if they fail BTC might be more attractive than a volatile fiat currency. But I admit even if lots of Yuan users decide to start using BTC I doubt it's going to "help the price out of its slump" to any significant degree.
