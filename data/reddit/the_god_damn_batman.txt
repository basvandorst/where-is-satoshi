Basically you can't see/predict the future, but the past is perfectly visible.

Take a look at Gemini.com. They offer minimal fees if you are looking to sell.

Everything can be done via coinbase, but it is recommended to create a wallet. Mt. Gox was an exchange like Coinbase that collapsed and many people lost a lot of Bitcoin.

Absolutely you could. It is called arbitrage trading. The only issues I see would be the transfer fees and how long it takes for the transfer to be confirmed.

Google has a similar thing. It will give someone access to your google related accounts. I suppose you could also include instructions on recovering your coins in the email it sends.

Just buy now or you just going to think later on why you didn't buy sooner. I just logged into my coinbase account for the first time in years. Coinbase said my first wallet was created 3 years ago, sometime around $500/BTC, but I was too scared to actually commit to purchasing any. I went ahead and made my first purchase to break the ice and now I can't wait to continue investing for the future!
