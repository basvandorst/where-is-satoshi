Been telling this to people since November 2017.
USA exchanges are fakestream media.
So much easy profits to be made from Coinbase to Blinktrade in Sourthamerica.
The difference via escrow for 1btc was 8000 on USA while I was trading for 9800 on Coinbase every 1 1/2 hours while Daylight hours 2 to 5 coins profits a day.
This gap in value was going on all the way when america was like bitcoin hit 19000+ hell bitcoin was at 23000+ around the world.  It already passed 20k
People need to stop trusting this exchanges, Localbitcoins don't lie about prices.
You in fear of doing a local bitcoin exchange take them into a bank (public area business and ask them for a 1099 and promissary note.)  At least you know you'll get your BITCOIN safe and secured.
Just like Satoshi Nakamoto stated in the past which is a fact.
"Bitcoin is worth what someone is willing to pay for it."
Just cause a group of webdevelopers get together first and claim they are the defacto price standard claim they post it on a central -fiat- exchanges don't mean it can't be controlled by -switches and -insider trading- deals behind shut door collusion.
That why I don't trust coin-marketcap still 100%
People don't remember about Roger Ver &amp; Mt Gox...?
LOL... keep your own privatekeys make your confimed Escrow Exchanges, just update the IRS or have a nice jailcell.

blockchain how I looked at it....
From a mmo gamers perspective....
* Player1:  We need our guild to build a vitrual castle but it will take 8000 hours...?
* Player2:  Ill join and mine iron virtually.
* Player3:  Ill join and mine copper virtually.
* Player4:  Ill join and mine gold virtually.
Several hours later.
* Player1:  What do we have? prepares to write a timestamp spreadsheet log of all work copy/pasta.
* Player2:  mined 240 iron here is my logfile
* Player3:  mined 450 mine guild leader my data file.
* Player4:  I got lucky and found 1 gold after 7 hours.
* Player1: Whenever we find a gold we create a final output CRC TIMESTAMP ENCRYPTED FILE.
How I make a backup:
WinRAR7ZIP timestamp all files together, ENCRTYPE by 10^48.  CRC CHECK, we do this for every file.  But instead of making 1 seperatefile each time... we will APPENDED THE DATA with a NEW CRC, if the OLD CRCS never match before the newest.  IT FAILS.
CHEER I MADE A NEW TECHNOLOGY, its a CATAPILLAR OF RAR ENCRYPTED TIMESTAMPS and A SUPER VIRUS FILE that DEFEATS HACKERS! CHEER.
* Player1:  We I forgot my password on the 7th box...
* Player2:  Oh crap we fucked
* Player3:  I got the file name
* Player4:  Luckily I remember the password for my 6th box.
* Player1:  This file is getting to big on my HDD anyone else want to host it?
* Player5:  I'm roger ver you are shilling my bcash don't do it meh meh meh.
* Player6:  I'm AAnoplous bitcoin Rngesus I will preech your shitttss
Oh wait i remember discussing this in during 9/11 putting password on mmo resources and increase the ingame value more higher then Ragnarok Online CARD 1/10000 drop rates to prevent bots...?

You need to enter your phrases / keys (Offline) get the QR code.  The shit is done very fast and instant.
Be careful and wary about it, and take your time step by step.  One mistake and you'll send your crypto into the abyss.
Just enter your prikey offline (unplug your wifi/net)
reboot pc from a cold start
Disable net adapter if you really cautious.
Hopefully your not trojaned with a text recorder from email or webbrowsing
Get that prikey-&gt;qr sweep the address.  If it errors ( itll say wrong format or something luckily for you sweeping gives a error if its not right )  Like rejected.  Keep trying till it works.  That how I managed to sweep my wallets.

Its basic supply and demand.
More eth dAAPS ICOS and other Shitcoins -&gt;
BitCoin rises by Demand and Hodlers
657,000 more coins will be minted from 2018 to Jan 1st 2019.
Out of those mined coins; China ban on ICO affects it somewhat.  Sorry to say there are just to many Scams out there with no Returns they just steal you Crypto of BTC cause they can't afford to Mine it.
Sorry; if there is NO INNOVATION behind the BTC other then speed of production of a shitcoin by blocksize, transaction time.  These are shills now.
Its been fixed since Litecoin &amp; DOGE.
Monero &amp; Aion took our privacy back; but the USG slapped you with Terrisom &amp; Drug Charges if you get caught using those basically for Tax Evasion.
Eth is pretty much the only change, and that Vaporware HASHGRID which might dethrone EVERYTHING... if it comes true.  But hashgrid is private tech.
Eth can't even run a Gaming Service but HashGrid claims they can run a Blockchain backed MMO-RPG with 450,000 transactions a second if this Vaporware becomes true.  That is crazy.  That 34% miner attack on Hashgrid is more risky then the 51% attacks though on Bitcoin.

"I have a contract to honor your bitcoin while in my Coinbase Company, but guess what.... your bitcoin cash is mine...?"
"Its my private keys the fork was created it was my benefit.  I just have to give you 'bitcoins' not bcash."
"That just social justice fud you know the terms of a fork yet you its not my responsiblity to know what days it will be forked that is YOURS."
"Its my cold wallet.   The 1:1 is my Bcash."
That would of been the BEST LESSON to the WHOLE CRYPTO WORLD.
And if the US government sided with Brain Armstrong.
You would be more wary of leaving your money in a Exchange overnight.
He could of left a mega billioniare and said peace.
Take your bitcoins.  I'll bcash my life.
No where in the contract did it say he had to honor FORKS... the only people who deserve a fork of bitcoin splits are those who HODL their private keys.
Like Andre Anno says "Not your private keys, not your bitcoins."
Of course you might of wanted to kill him for getting one over on you, but who gave him your bitcoin.
You did.
Be your own bank.

* compare both original fork vs bcash fork...?
* wait a second if it was supposed to just be BIGGER blocks? Then why is BTC at its height, yet Bcash is +100000 higher?
Bcash is a shillcoin of centralized hardware explotiation, a bigger block dont mean faster transaction time.  That hardware is CENTRALIZED and CONTROLLED.  That isn't the original BITCOIN idea or WHITEPAPER AT ALL.

They are "investors" when tech comes around in car factors in the past, they replace humans with "ROBOTS" for reasons... faster, accuracy, no food to sustain, parts, tech hiring, less downtime.
They ask "Banks &amp; Investors" for FIAT INFINITE PRINTED TOILETPAPER DOLLARS to "Basically FIRE HUMAN LABOR"  this is unavoidable but in a CAPITALIST SOCIETY;  THEY SAY ITS FAIR.  YOUR FIRED.
Now that we have Bitcoin as a byproduct of the TECHNOLOGY of the BLOCKCHAIN, that which does....
All the "INVESTING, BANKING, ACCOUNTING" of the Investors, Bankers, Accountants and Middlemen.
THEY CLAIM its illegal with their controlled 1% elected collusion controlled voting system but yet we live in a CAPITALIST SOCIETY?   Is that fair now?

Flip a coin 160 times.  That is your private key.  If you had a box unlocked with 1 dollar anyone can steal it publicaly.
Now a bitcoin is different, imagine a box, hidden in 10 planets of boxes stack like Jupiter.   Good luck.
There is no database on earth can log every single bitcoin, or have even enough power to.  Its over 25 yottabytes.
1 exabyte is the current amount of all harddrive memory on earth, you need 1000 exabytes to make 1 yotabyte, you need 25 yotabytes to hack all bitcoins in 1 second.

This is the funny part of bitcoin; Litecoin solved those issues.  Every bitcoin fork is just a unhappy group of miners who couldn't see the experiment to the end of 21,000,000 coins mined.
Anyone can make their own fork, you don't need permission from anyone on the blockchain.
Why do you think they pre-mine 10000 blocks for themselves know why?  GREED and ANGER that they didn't get involved in 2009 mostly.
Roger Ver claims he's Satoshi Nakamoto.
But he can't spend 1 satoshi from 1,000,000 from 2009.
That proves he is a liar.
When he belittled Andre, look what the community did... made him become a Millionare overnight.
But if Andre had class, he would say "I don't need the money, I just need the community."

You should be making 800+ a day minus your power bills running it all.
Put 100th/for each one and you'll make your ROI in 40-54 days... and whatever after profit.
One year you should have +17- Seventeen bitcoin (minus the ROI)
You can always sit 1 miner out solo mining and hope you hit a block ( alone ).  Then make a good 12.5 by luck once or twice in 2 years.
Regardless look at a website : what their pool withdrawl reqs are.
Always hit your quo, or you not gonna withdrawl shit for each 100th/s mining that pool.

If its not bitcoin or gold, silver, platinum, copper or DOGE.
just like that old man a few years ago who didn't know what "STRUCTURING" meant and had the IRS come and steal $100,000 of his savings from his honest business for no reason.  Its illegal to deposit cash into your bank, after paying yourself correctly with your employees?  GTFO.
If you want to do a contract and pay a satoshi worth for a job.  KEEP YOUR WORD.  Do the job.
Maintain the connection as Satoshi per Hour contacts.  Stop trying to one up everyone with that Fiat Scam System.  Bitcoin is freedom to decide your own worth, your own contracts, your own price.
Trying to always pin bitcoin to the dollar is just returning to the rat race, bitcoin was made to say fuck you.  Too those hidden cartels: Your world currency project died in 2009 because we took part of this experiment and we not involved in your small table decided we don't need a central authority over a decentralized borderless consensus of everyone agreement of worth.

google blinktrade -&gt; its $13,000+ all the damn bitcoinmarketcap is bullshit.
the point of bitcoin is this :  A single bitcoin is worth what someone will pay for IT.  Exchanges are to hold your keys if you want CASH NOW, but if they hold your private keys ; shit get stolen.  you get 0
BE YOUR OWN BANK, Know your customers, Research How to make a Offline Wallets ( that nobody will ever steal ) once you do that....  Contact a LEGIT trust-worthy escrow provider in the world.  Might cost a little more but if you want to think your the "STANDARD"  YOU ARE NOT.
"You set the price of bitcoin" that why you are a DECENTRALIZED BANKER.

1 bitcoin is like a kingdom, of 100,000,00 satoshi branded farms.
Why you think they want to give it CAPTIAL GAINS TAXES, like LAND.
Cause that shit is property and currency together; with a added bonus of undefeated security and networking.
Now some deep future shit:  
Inter-space travel and planetary mining; with \[ old central banker galatic double spend wars \].
Trust me, these central bankers will TRY it with fiat still in change.  
Imagine you had about a 13 billion tons of Iron going from Titan to Mars.  
The energy and shit alone could be offset with VALUE by \[ bitcoin \].
Bitcoin -&gt; ICO - \[ Company worth \] or \[ Company delisted for Crimes \] by all Exchanges.  
Get it; consensus security is just that powerful.
Someone gonna pay bitcoin secured by math intergalactic banking decentralized by nodes though space satellites.  
This shit is really beyond value for our time by scaling and innovation.
  
yet you primates still holding to the false paper dollars... hahhahah get with the times.
1 bitcoin = you hit the lottery.
Cause all these ICO are gonna be the new forms of STOCK VALUES as TOKENS wanting King Bitcoin &amp; Prince Satoshi to confirm their planetary gains taxes aka block reward.  
To make sure their workers part of any company is worth MORE BITCOIN in the end.  
But guess what; there isn't enough bitcoin anymore left.  
This is why there are ICO alt coins, anyone who tries to immiate bitcoin itself is fraud.  
Nobody wants to trust centralized coins.  
That shit has the chance of FRAUD now.  
I can slightly trust a ICO not as a form of creation of self worth but now business to trade.  
But as a form of \[ hey we are a group of workers and this is our products and how we contribute to society peacefully \] this is how the world values us in \[ bitcoin \] by decentralized inter-galatic consensus by peaceful honesty.
  
Nobody said a ICO can't represent a \[ Army \] of another country or let say space military after all we talking about intergalatic mining understand?

THe problem was -&gt; bitcoin should of been built with a self growing blocksize like the difficulty.
When all these exchanges were made the CORE developers should of saw worked with society by consensus and adapted the exchanges value into the transaction fee reductions
It should of detected the average value of a few top 10~20 world exchanges then drop the 0.0005 fee to 0.00005 if it hit $10,000 a coin then 0.000005 to $100,000 a coin.
If your not part of the top 10 or 20 exchanges that would be the ONLY CORE VOTE to add your Exchange to the AVERAGE BALANCE of leveraging what a BITCOIN should be worth.  It won't be easy to buy a VOTE by then.

Bitcoin is priced at whatever the "private key" owner thinks its worth. 
Just cause a exchange says this is what people are paying.
Someone could sell a bitcoin for a "Million dollars" on Localbitcoins and confirm the trade.
That is a lucky SOB.
If it happens.
Then all exchanges will be like "That Milllionare Was Stupid"
that's until all the other milionsare realize there isn't 21,000,000 bitcoins left its more like 14,000,000 cause people don't know what coins are dead, lost, destorybed by formats, stupid fatfinger errors, or deaths of user.
The VOID is huge.
That why bitcoin only GOES UP to the Moon!
And with 18,000,000 mined.... its only gonna get slower, and better for those who got them first.
Years later after his death on news media network stations will be like "The Warren Buffet Berth Haathshire Blah blah blah LLC Trust is now worth 10 trillion dollars, who'd of thought one man could be worth more then -GOLD MARKET- alone.  Not to mention Satoshi Nakamoto as well, passing even him."
Think of it like this... there is 3,000,000 left.  that is 3,000,000 more milionares letting it pass them by.
If a billionare jumps in and scoops up 100,000 btc ~ 180000 btc ( 1.8 billion dollars at currency prices ) think of what the other billionares will have to do to get whats left of the 2,280,000 bitcoins left?
See if Warren Buffet was smart he'd dorp at least 25% of his worth into Bitcoin.

If you got a paper dollar, paper euro, paper rubble, paper yen, whipe your ass with it and say "I didn't know Charmin Had a Bank Fiat Ass Whipes competitor in Walmart or Whole Foods Shelves."

Ukraine is very very very currupt with BLACK MONEY.Most of their visa, amex, mastercard terminals don't work.
ATM are capped at withdrawls of UAH 'grivinha'Most doctors and lawyers there are paid like $200 a month ( legally not including the BLACK MONEY they don't report as tax evasion )
Most people have fancy cars with ZERO PETRO in Kyiv.Everyone is angry and the food is cheap.
If you got involved with a GOld Digger mostly all russian/ukraine women from these cities ODESSA, KYIV, LVIV, DONTESK, ST PETERSBERG since 2014 and beforeUkraine dating websites are all owned by Russian Mob.\*\* anastasiadate\*\* dream-singles\*\* hotrussianbrides\*\* loveme
Most the women there are MODELS paid to act on a date from a website called::[Uprincess.net](  which rewards them for SCAMMING you for big kickbacks of what idiot tourist cucks spend on their women to think they are DATING.[podium.im]( ( was [podium.com]( but the publicity was so bad they changed their names a few times )
Most of the info about the COURRUPT industry is found here[
It goes from thread 1 to thread 023984029 of women trying to use bots, video 1 press prerecorded flicks to do what you ask like \[ BLOW A KISS \] \[ WAVE \] like a piano pad but to make you thikn its them on camera but its IVAN or a MAN scamming you.
Now these women know about crypto for their MOB overlords and liars
But they are full of shit.The most ruthless then was to learn this from a Russian Translator in her 22s after being great friends."Most of those women will get a divorce on their visa and still fuck their husband and be married and use the PAPER AS A COVERUP.That is how bad UKRAINE and RUSSIAN women are due to PUTIN's controls."
After all in 2016 election with TRUMP he said "He would stop trafficing sex slaves to EU and USA" its a fact look for it.
Sure you might find some love being a bitcoin holder, but the chance of you finding true love in ukraien is like you MANUALY FINDING A SHARE in SHA256
P.S. GOOGLE TRANSLATOR WORKS and can easily RELAY A CONVERSATION between Ukraine/Russian and ENGLISH, if a girl tell you its bad.  SHE IS A LIAR. AND YOUR A IDIOT ABOUT TO BE CUCKED. Its the same software these sites use to CHAT with YOU.

Bitcoin can let the People by Concensus totally ignore the TAX SYSTEM, WAR SPENDING, BULLSHIT.

Turn your BUSINESS INTO PAYING IN BITCOIN DAILY.
Spread adoption.
Let the poor people learn to Barter and Trade themselves.
Let the poor learn to HODL, and learn to  invest their satoshis wiser.

freedom of speech, freedom of expression.     
Banks &amp; Media speak fud.  
Trading Bitcoin is expression.  
IF the expression is peaceful, there is no ILLEGAL TO IT. THe only thing illegal is you FORCING your EXPRESSION onto others.  
Get it.  Bitcoin isn't forcing you to use it.  Its just the BETTER THING and CHOICE TO USE to get RID OF THE REAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY PRINTING MONEY for a SELECT FEW WHO FEEL THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE YOUR WORTH.  SO FUCK THEM, in a DECENTRALIZED CONSENSUS FORMAT.

anti-american, my ass-
The people are all people.  The coin was made for all people.
That is a direct attack on the central overlords and their programming by media and system.
Who said they should be the ONES to pick what has value?  What omnipotent voice rang across your ears for thousands of years.  None.
Bitcoin is tech and evolution.  The paper system and all its flaws are coming to a end in these next hundred years.
Those who adopt early will be the next 2%, there isn't a 1% anymore.
This time, they will have to give into the system or disappear with their old one.
Buy, HODL a little, but spend to increase its adoption.
-spend buy 1 bitcoin - tell your employees you will pay XXX.XX of your nation currency or you will get XX.XX + some satoshis at a lower rate.
- taht will change the global structure faster then the big idiots who just hodl.  the ones that just pure Hodl, are the dirrect attacks programming you with LAMBOS and DREAMS with media.
Get passed that bullshit and look at the world, with work and effort.
Am I crazy?  Sure am, but at least I'm looking optomistaclly at a world where the investors of double side treason wars will actually be fully tracked hopefully and held accountable for their LYING COLLUSION CRIMES by a BLOCKCHAIN LEDGER.

Brain wallets are secure as fuck if you learn how to add symbols added to key points of any quotes then Email salt them offline after a format/fdisk.
Example  Four Scores and Seven Years Ago.
When you do it make it like this
!  
This alone would take trillions of hours without any hints.  Just \~ to the += key could ruin a life of discovery hell you might make it to andromeda galaxy before that shit is found.
for example.  There are plenty of SHIFT KEY symbols to obfuscate any crap or bruteforce key gen
I dont use that but I bet you no crypto sweeper running a wallet sweeper will swipe your wallet if that shit in a brain wallet properly devised ever if you create a unique code that is LONG &amp; HARD just by following this example by style
Just don't forget to use proper random upper and lower case as well.  Look up a google maps, grab 4-6 hell even 10 street to obfuscate.
Use those streets around you but change certain points.  Add symbols. Case Upper and Lower.
IMPOSSIBLE TO CRACK if your password is over 100 characters/symbols.just dont lose that shit yourself.

But wants a fee, overseeding the miners block mining fees.Middleman bullshit.
I like it but until it works like "BITTORRENT" where anyone can be part of the "DATA" where anyone can be a BISQ node working aside the miners to promote just mining more like why not program the damn code into the bitcoin miners itself.  Don't want no parts of it that much.
