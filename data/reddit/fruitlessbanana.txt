This is the best way. Been using this since I found out a few months ago. But this makes me wonder, back in the day Coinbase payed all fees on behalf of customers. They stopped this a couple years ago I think. I wonder if eventually GDAX will stop paying the fees for the customers. I hope that never happens

@_date: 2015-12-25 17:20:37
My favorite moment of 2015 was when the price cruised around the 200-250 range for so long, allowed for a good accumulation 
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:38:16
This seams backwards. They were originally under the CB branding umbrella when they launched as Coinbase Exchange. Then they pivoted as a pseudo third party brand under “GDAX” which in my opinion was a solid move for building an independent exchange product. To pivot again under the CB umbrella (and also with a title as ambiguous and bland as ‘Pro’ ) seams like strange move, especially after building so much hype into the GDAX brand. I wonder if this will effect trading/withdraw fees, since GDAX has always been free however Coinbase is not (and you pay the miner fee).

@_date: 2018-05-03 15:27:07
Those are the restrictions of starting and contributing to a Roth, but it doesn't mean someone in that lower income position shouldn't be aware of the tax advantages it offers. 
Also someone high NW with income that exceeds the cap who already had a Roth previous to that income, could easily move a position into GBTC and still get tax free Bitcoin exposure that way.

It’s not a true blockchain though, IMO. Their foundation literally censored the ETH blockchain and hard forked to prevent the losses during the DAO incident in summer 2016. The above comments are accurate and this just goes to show the real state of “blockchain” in 2018. Everyone likes to forget that this happened. It was really controversial back in the day.

I agree with your comment 100%. I love the old school wiki-esque feel of the current Bitcoin.org. Bitcoin was never created with the purpose of how much it would eventually be worth in US dollars. It should not be present on the main website. Even Ethereum does not have a price ticker on their ethereum.org website.

The saving feature is neat, but ensure that there would bet a time span release as well. 
Someone could theoretically save 1 BTC a month, for four months, however what happens if on the fifth month lets say that the price skyrockets and another bitcoin becomes unattainable due to market price? The person locked into saving is now out of luck if there is no set time release. 
This does assume a moon scenario, but you never know.

I'm a firm believer that one day, the bitcoin denomination system will have to use bits, or lower, out of pure necessity. I really think there will come a time when units like 1 BTC or 0.5 BTC will be so large and rare, that people will think about the users today and the opportunity we had.
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:40:26

This isn't necessarily true. If he bought Ethereum at ICO, 1 BTC was approx. 1900 ETH, . If someone put in 3 BTC (at the time about $2000 if I'm remembering correctly) today they could swap their 5,000 ETH for about 390 BTC. OP could be fiat whale with deep pockets, or another new crypto whale :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:09:29
Philosophical belief? No, it is a fact. One bitcoin will always equal one bitcoin. No one has a crystal ball that can predict the future US dollar value value or what a theoretical "price maximum" would be. Comparisons have been made to global money supply and cash accounts many times since the beginning of bitcoin's existence, search bitcointalk. This puts it's USD value in the 100K-1M range.

Incredibly short sighted thinking. A market that cannot be shut down by Feds, cannot be exit scammed and money stolen, and 100% self sustaining with no fees for the users or sellers will see so much use from vendors and users sick of the BS of traditional TOR markets. Give it time.

According to their [official list of regulated securities exchanges]( no bitcoin exchanges have registered with the SEC.

i am also curious about this - RemindMe! one year
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:31:43
No problem, basically once the point is reached where no more bitcoin are available to mine, the transaction fees that are included in each transaction will be sufficient to incentivize mining. 
To prove how such poor journalism this article represents, **this exact problem** is referenced specifically in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Page 4, line 11. I quote Satoshi: 










The author of this smear piece has not even read the 9 paper white paper that has been available since 2009. If you're in the stage of researching and learning about Bitcoin, please be careful with the sources of information regarding these concepts, as there is so much inaccurate assumptions that are published out there. 
This is just a simple example but others can expand on how the second layer solutions will work to sustain the network after the reward is depleted. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:01:58
The fees are kind of high though, just so everyone is aware.

Contempt of court is a real thing. A judge can say that you owe the ex-spouse a portion of the crypto. In this case, failing to divide the assets by using the keys you could be thrown in jail. The best, if anything, is do not disclose holdings to anyone, including spouses.
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:26:54
If the spouse can produce blockchain addresses knowing to belong to the other spouse or any kind of evidence to indicate he has funds(conversations, screenshots, emails) I would imagine a case can be built to enough to convince a judge. 
This is a gray area, but a similar idea is being held in contempt for forgetting a password (aka forgeting or 'losing' a private key). See here: 
As I stated in my other comment, the best approach, is complete privacy regarding blockchain assets in a marriage. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:40:40
No, use a mobile wallet that stores the keys on the device itself, and backup the Seed phrase. Breadwallet, now called Bread, is a reliable way to store small amounts.

Author - "I have no technical understanding of Bitcoin, it's just nerd money, and I don't know anything about scaling solutions like LN and I ask four ceos how it works and they couldn't tell me so I will write a normie article with a click bait title making a claim I just came up with out of nothing because I don't actually understand what I am talking about"
These people never cease to entertain me. Lets add it to the list.

I agree. The SEC chairman specically mentioned the distinction between decentralized, open source protocols, and ICO "securities" tokens. This is probably going to affect multi-asset markets for tokens.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:24:49
If they were hacked then the risk of those hacked coins being dumped on the market would be high, which would cause a massive sell off regardless if the coins get dumped or not.
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:46:31
Don't tell anyone about bitcoin, just accumulate as much as can. The sheep will come eventually, why waste your time trying to convince an ignorant person?

Yes. The big exchanges can easily fill a 250 btc market order, in minutes probabaly. The money would then have to be withdrawn via ACH transfer so you’d be looking at 4-5 days till it gets in your actual bank account.

If you can, invest $80 in a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano or a TREZOR. Desktop wallets can be hacked easily.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:45:56
If Coinbase/GDAX goes down or gets hacked, expect a market fallout the likes of which has MtGox levels. In August 2016 They were custodians to 700MM worth of customer assets, when BTC was around $600. Now this is in the billions. Thousands of people use Coinbase to store BTC, ETH, and LTC. Expect 80-90% price loss for the entire crypto industry if the unicorn gets killed.

I remember watching this when you first posted. Lol what happened to SeansOutpost
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:32:35
I don't think this is the right time, also I doubt this is happening. Maybe in two years when scaling is fixed.
@_date: 2018-07-14 11:44:31
A price of $6,000 was literally unthinkable. Moving hundreds of dollars was the norm, not thousands. Everyone wanted it to go back to $1,000 but it was stuck below that for three* years. Mt.gox destroyed the BTC market, PBOC banned btc once a week, Gavin still worked on core lol. Coinbase only sold btc. Good times
edit -years
@_date: 2018-07-15 12:27:13
December 2013 - January 2017. I’m rounding the years but it was still technically 4

Coinbase will support buying and selling B2X immediately following the fork. This is going to be confusing for people who are just getting into bitcoin. Not sure how I feel about this...
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:15:15
You are so kind 
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:36:28
if your are actually serious and this isn't a troll post- then you're going about this the wrong way. quiting your job now is a bad move and if you honestly believe that price is coming in a year than you should be working harder and accumulating as much as possible. Also what are you smoking 
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:56:37
Never tell anyone that you have bitcoins or how many you have
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:22:47
it sounds more like you need a career change/new job. expecting bitcoin to go full on moon in the next year and quiting your job now is not a good strategy

Other way around. ETH did that, and ETC objected to reversing transactions so they split. ETC is the original, untouched chain.

I upvoted you, and you are right. To be fair, bitcoin prices crossed $1,000 for the first time in the year 2013. They didn't return until the year of 2017. You are right though, when you compare the months it was almost exactly a 3 year linear window. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:37:15
Did Shrem have to give up all his coins? I don't know the whole story. I can't imagine him doing that 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:00:03
 I’m on mobile but here is the snip from that article about it:
“The moment Draper heard about Bitcoin, he was in. Draper invested $250,000 when the price was at $6. He lost it all in the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange in 2014, but Draper was not deterred”
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:04:36
They should offer these shirts away if you refer a few people to use their service. I've wanted a coinbase shirt for a really long time after seeing all their employees wear them. Dry fit ones would be great for the gym. Don't have the money for this though
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:08:42
He had more bitcoins before the auction bought on Mt.Gox but him and his son Adam lost them when it collapsed

That’s the most accurate depiction of the feelings from earlier days. No one helped, and everyone doubted and ridiculed. Crazy how times change.
@_date: 2017-05-02 02:48:22
yes I believe so. it's almost scary at this point, following bitcoin for so long seeing it repeat time and time again

@_date: 2016-07-08 18:39:27
agree. coinbase is chill if you just transfer your coins out. everyone complains but they aren't exactly forcing anyone to use their service. following laws is annoying but there are many other solutions for getting bitcoins that don't involve strict kyc/aml

It is a figure of speech, calm down. Basically what it means is if you don't secure the keys yourself, you open yourself up to theft by trusting a third party with them and the likely hood of recovering the funds is dramatically reduced when compared to traditional systems. Legally those coins "were" his, but good luck recovering them after they've been mixed, tumbled and obfuscated 100x. Bitcoiners have known this for years and it is not changing.

I'm conflicted because I want to feel sorry for this guy but he broke the most important rule of bitcoin, if you don't have the keys they are not your coins :(
