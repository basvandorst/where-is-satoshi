Then more people will stop mining and it becomes more profitable for the people that keeps mining in countries with low electricity costs... Because the 12,5 btc each 10 min will be distributed to less people

Yes all new commers arent buying btc anymore.. I see this in many crypto facebook groups... They buy eth/ltc because btc fees are to high for their 100 euro/dollar investment. Then they exchange their eth/ltc for some shitcoin that they think will make them rich...

@_date: 2018-01-09 09:42:40
yes a constant run up in a "long" time period. but when btc suddenly spikes trading pairs btc/altcoins (altcoins who dont have fiat markets) wouldnt be affected? or did I forget something
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:48:43
why because the orderbooks would still show Altcoin1 = 0.1 btc at that moment, they will not be automaticly adjusted because their prices are fixed in btc and not fiat
edit: your answer would be true if altcoin has a big Altcoin/fiat market
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:43:08
The best and fastest coin today will become obsolete when one week later a newer coin comes out with all the same features but slightly better... 
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:29:48
Less people using btc for transfer to exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:56:13
Or maybe fund the "new" wordseed with a small amount so they think they got the right one
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:22:41
Good... I increased my btc with 40% because if this crash �� 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:52:24
I think this dip is because the new batch of antminers is available wich are only payable in bch... I also bought some miners for btc mining

Dollars or euro or...? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:31:41
What is it gone allready? Was it really bought or did the seller just removed some of his orders?

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:52:23
Because it went too high too fast! But still if you bought a month ago and diddnt look at the price till now you would see 65% profit and d be fucking happy....

If the website reaches 250k your btc in your website wallet will double... Looks legit haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:21:24
But the big wallets in the top 100 are probably wallets of exchanges and some of the huge btc wallets are probably lost forever
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:52:57
I just got the chart from 
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:29:37
It looks like the website was made with the website creator from wix.com and running on their servers. Maybe you can contact them to shut down the site or gather some information about the scammers but they were probably not stupid so they would have used vpn, anonymous email service,...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:59:48
If it continues like this we will need to exchange private keys to move some btc ��

100% speculation but we see 2 bubbles after the halving. after the 2nd bubble pops it slowly consolidates and climb slowly when it comes closer to the next halving

@_date: 2017-02-16 12:03:47
No i think its good for buying. I ve bought a lot of coins there but always transfer them directly to my hardware wallet. Dont leave your bitcoins there if you are planning to hold them for a long time. When coinbase get hacked (I dont say it will but it could) say bye bye to your coins...

Someone posted that link in the ethtrader subreddit. So downloaded the tradingbot and installed it to see how it works, but it didnt open so i uninstalled the program but it had secretly installed another program the "intel.exe". I discovered it by looking at the programs that are automaticly starting when windows is starting. In the list a saw programs like steam, etc... But there was a program with a strange icon and called intel.exe. So i opened the file location and there it was the keylogger even with a map containing all my logs dated per day. But it was allready to late...

@_date: 2017-08-17 09:28:12
If nobody wants it? Then it will have a value of around nothing. The same a an autograph from elvis, if suddenly nobody wants it anymore it will have no value. Scarcity and demand is what gives things their value aside from the inherent value. But the best thing about bitcoin is that there is a real limited supply. Instead of gold wich they are constantly taking out of the ground. We dont know how much gold there is in the ground... If tomorow someone discovers a HUGE gold supply the price will fall hard. And they can allready make gold in labs it wont be long before making gold in a lab becomes cheaper than mining it... 
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:52:57

If you have for ex 1btc and 1b2x you can add a small amount like 0,01btc to your btc wallet then you have 1,01btc and 1b2x. after that you send the 1,01btc to a different address... Now the transaction cant be replayed because you send 1,01btc and you only have 1b2x

It was just extremely profitable to mine btc when it was 20k but the difficulty to mine btc adjusts every 2 weeks if its difficult to mine btc today diesnt mean it will be in the future. If more people start mining the difficulty increases... And if less people are mining (maybe price too low) the difficulty will decrease...

Register on coinbase.com and login with coinbase account on gdax.com. Wait for wire transfer to go trough then buy buy buy... Or creditcard to buy instant but high fees...

You will do more damage to your processor than profit in btc i would not recomend to mine with a standard pc
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:56:09
Your not buying only bitcoin right now... Youre also buying bitcoin gold and s2x. I think its not going lower till the forks so if you want btc only you should wait for a dip after fork imo

Maybe people start buying things when they really need them... Instead of buying stupid shit they dont need every day! This overconsuming is killing the planet. Bitcoin will save the planet. Thanks btc!

Yes coinbase support fork, but use gdax to buy bitcoin you can login with your coinbase account but dont have to pay high fees like on coinbase

Quick question, nothing to do with this post but didnt want to start a new post. If btc rises, other cryptos profit from it and are rising too but if some other cryptos are rising btc will not rise? So how real are the other cryptos' prices?
