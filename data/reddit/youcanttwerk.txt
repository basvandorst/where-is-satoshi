Then they lost the war due to being one man short, his village was invaded, and his family murdered. His neighboring village came over and said, "How tragic."  
He responded, "May be."

Because its his hard work. Simple as that. Same reason why Chase app isnt open source. Or the Etrade app. Doesnt belong to you, and they made the decision not to.

SO many mixed feelings with this. I'm glad that manipulation *may* cease. but at the same times, free market?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:36:46
Thats what I was thinking. I mean, I know it doesnt mean you can openly steal the code, but it doesnt mean they wont. For something that doesnt hold your coins, but just information you input, open source isnt necessary (to me at least.)

Which IMO is WAY BETTER.  If I load $50 worth of BTC, it shouldn't go up or down from that point. It should be $50.

I dont get it. We say this for years, and they deny it - then suddenly "come to this spontaneous" conclusion that its not a bubble. This is next gen money. Get on it, or stuck in the past. Simple enough.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:19
I actually dont own any btc. I swing trade smaller coins and make plenty of returns. ;) This whole thing is just another way to make money / transfer funds from one person to another.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:50:57
I'm attacking the thought process - if you're attached to it, thats on you.  
If you are you gonna just feel dumb everytime the price drops below the "marker" of when someone said "you should sell", then just get out of investing as a whole. Because you're going to be a very mentally strained person if you continue down that path.

In 2 weeks/months/years when its $25k, you'll be saying "In retrospect, I was right." Shut up with this nonsense flip flop mentality.  Youre still in the green from your $900 entry. 0,0

Do you have examples to back up your closed minded statement? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:47:44
Am I the only one who went through full verification processes before throwing money in? Paypal freezes WAY larger accounts often. You most likely NEVER verified before dumping money in, like a fucking dumbass. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:47:27
I really wish people who made these videos spoke clearly and not like someone is holding a gun to their head demanding they splurge out info as fast as possible. 
Maybe even do a little bit of scripting / prep work. -.-

Just Splay It?

This isnt a credit card. This isnt a bank. This is like cash bills (not referring to shitcoincash, so dont even start with that).  
In your situation, if the owner took your cash bills and didnt give you the pizza, you'd be in the same exact predicament. 
Also, he could still take your shitcoincash and not give you the pizza, and you'd have 0 recourse.

That is HUGE news on the 2FA. We're in 2017 - everything should have 2FA.

The whole point is "decentralized" is to not have a majority of nodes in a single spot - as far as I'm aware
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:17:36
I can see that. But I can also see it pushing people away from Bitcoin if they've never ever seen a single person standing at the Kiosk and its just wasting energy. There is one in my local mall, that I've never seen used ever.

This sub can suck my dick. [I posted the same shit yesterday]( and it was removed for "not being relevant". Mods are garbage here.

Redditor for a month. Ya I'll go ahead and not listen to your thoughts.

Cute response lady.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:56:11
Very carefully! :P

You're vastly unaware of how many people used BTC / BCH for gilding.

@_date: 2018-11-22 03:40:20
honestly had no clue where to post it. Most subs ban memes it seems like.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:10:30
and why the fuck would anyone hire someone "new to crypto" for this role? What an absolutely ridiculous business decision.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:32:54
Oh! I see what you're saying now. Gotcha!!
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:56:25
Bet that the social media guy there is a BCH fan.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:25:54
Believe it or not, you can also NOT be any of those things, and just be a bitcoin bandwagoner whos upset they bought at 19k. So I'll just stick to my own guns.

How else am I going to tie in blood money and crypto deaths to Young Billy Gates? 
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:32:18
He's doing illegal shit with the money.

LMFAO this is amazing.
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:15:07
No. Its irregular enforcement of arbitrary rules - you stupid fuck. This is bigger than karma, its people having power when they clearly shouldnt.

Bought food with bitcoin. Definitely not a fuckin scam.

The most difficult part is their willingness to learn.

@_date: 2017-10-14 20:38:07
Is there anything I can read on now as far as getting a pi / screen to read out the btc current value?  Also you da best!
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:52:15
Yeah I just laugh at poor suckers who use bitcoin atms. Those fees / rates gotta hurt.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:18:02
I'd love to find resources on how to make one!! Please link me any info you have to do something similar, if you have the time. :)

Just built a PC using BTC with transactions that were as fast as my debit card, so those shitheads can eat a bag of dicks.

Its hilarious that Roger lost his shit at 'bcash' but is okay with saying "bitcoin core". Fuckkkking hypocrite.

The same way you explain reaching a website. Not every site is hosted on a single server, and sometimes you bounce through a chain of servers to get to the right one.

Same reason blacks, asians, whites, etc do. Its easier to use blanket statement.
