Use this one here:   | Used it myself to donate some btc to Russia, to get VIP Access for a Music Site and it worked flawlessly.

But if you click on something online and agree to pay $1.95,-, but get charged straight 2x $57,- (from Spain, so no average purchase), then you are nor protected, not even, if you straight call the bank and tell them. They send you off, to try to resolve it yourself, which is for sure easily working out for you, not. Its just a selective protection and they just want to track everything crypto for the ATO etc.

We did and they said, as long its not fully booked / pending, they would do nothing and even after its fully booked, they sent us to off to try to get the money back ourselves. I had even to cancel my visa debit card, because they wouldn't put a block in place, to prevent further charges of the same company. St. George Bank that is and its not the first time, that they acted like jerks. A few years ago, I found a $100,- charge from overseas for consulting purposes, from a by then known scamming source, but they refused to do something, because e-cheques apparently can be only canceled by the person, which initiated the charge / started the e-cheque, which was the scammer. We had to close the whole account, to prevent further charges to that account, which was my wife's wages account. As said, selective protection.

I will go back to the bank and try to recover the money, but they already told us, that it will take several month and that there is no garantie, to get the money back. When I ordered something online from an Australian PC Store, which took still payments, even after they already made a runner and all stock was already gone and left their webstore / website up and running, Myer Visa refunded me the money within 5 weeks and that without much fuss. PayPal refunded me the money for a drone, where Australia Post had scanned it as delivered and after an internal review had told me, that it was possibly delivered to the wrong address and just sent me back to the overseas shop / seller (China), which had also provided a working tracking number. Again no fuss and got the refund, before Australia Post even had finished their internal review. So yeah... I'm not attacking You, its just what I experienced in the past so far.

It's an awesome app with a great UI. Me and my wife subbed for a year (1x Android, 1x iOS) and are looking forward to all the upcoming features. Highly recommended. :)
