You can't think of a single case? Off the top of my head: Selling bitcoin for cash on localbitcoins, then walking away and paying a little more to send the bitcoin back to one of your addresses. Now you have cash and bitcoin.

[Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them.](

Yup, now that mining is not done in the node they are useless. SPV wallets are superior and you only need to run a node if you are running a mining pool.

Where is the source code? I couldn't find it anywhere on the site. The FAQ says it is open source. Please change the FAQ to have a link to the source or don't say it is open source.
Also, ditch the altcoins and concentrate on Bitcoin. Having multiple coins cheapens the brand.

If his wallet uses RBF then he could...
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:49:12
No, because Segwit involves sending and storing witness data along with the block. Core's version will have the witness data be sent alongside the 1MB block, with witness data being capped at 3 times the block. With 2MB blocks, the witness data could be as large as 6MB, meaning 8MB would have to move across the network.

You can use "Economic" or "Low Priority." Especially for payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase. You don't actually care when the tx gets confirmed, just that the processor saw it so you can proceed with the purchase.

The default is to be able to run on 512 MB of RAM. So 100 MB for dbcache and 300 MB for maxmempool, and you have some buffer room left over.
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:39:25
Same thing that happens when you send any other tx.

This would presumably reduce the frequency of single transaction blocks correct?
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:25:46


Wrong, it gives a capacity of 1.7-4.0 MB. That's a max of twice what the hard fork implementation wants.


Well which is it? 4 MB or 2.0 MB?

Blockchain.info run a node based on Bitcoin Core. Of course they check for valid addresses. And even if they didn't, any node they broadcast to would reject it.

OP you are a fool if you believe your client's story.

Huh? They said hackers got a hold of gift card numbers, meaning they can spend your gift cards. Regardless of whether you bought the gift cards with bitcoin or not.

Ok, then you're completely mistaken or being disingenuous. [The particular proposal amounts to a 4MB blocksize increase at worst.](
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:39:51
Did you not read the comment I was replying to, which I quoted in my reply? He says we assume 100% adoption of SW txs, and then at *most* effective blocksize limit becomes 1.7mb. That is incorrect. I pointed out that 1.7mb becomes the *minimum* at 100% adoption. At *most*, as in your "theoretical" example, is 4mb. What bullshit am I spreading? I corrected him and I was entirely correct.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:21:27
You don't have to upgrade your wallet to 0.12; a miner has to use 0.12. You can send an RBF transaction by making the sequence number below MAX-1. Then send another with a higher fee. You could have always done this, but now a miner running 0.12 will replace your new one if it didn't opt-out of opt-in RBF.
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:03:18
So you haven't even used it in 2 years but you think we need to change the protocol?
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:04:45
is that way
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:53:34
The amount of bitcoin being sent does not affect the actual size of the transaction. Things that affect the size of the transaction are the number of inputs and outputs and the number of signatures per input. So the more addresses you are getting coins from and the more people who must sign for those, plus the number of addresses you are distributing those coins to. 
So really if you are sending $1 or $1 million the size of the transaction could be the same if it is from one address to another. That size is what affects the current fee. Also, $0.02 to send a dollar to anywhere in the world is very, very cheap.
@_date: 2016-02-03 04:20:03


That's completely false. At *most* we will see 4mb at 100% adoption, at *minimum* we will see 1.7mb at 100% adoption.
