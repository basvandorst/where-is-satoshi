Maybe it was a right decission when he made it. But now, knowing what we know, we can say that it was a really bad decission.

I wonder how many nodes will be available tomorrow
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:53:31
That is not volatility, just a 3.5% from lowest to highest
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:59:15
Obviously he did not.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:39:29
No, he is not stupid, indeed he is very smart. But he is also a liar.

Default is 1 sat/byte but you can configure the minimum fee to relay transactions. This is my node configuration:
\ (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for relaying, mining and transaction creation (default: 0.00001)
I think that lowering the default is a good thing. There is no reason to avoid paying less fees.

Official binaries are already compiled with zmq support
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:35:46
Why compile when you can download the binaries ?

Thats the way it should be done. You shouldn't reuse any address. Even more, you shouldn't share same addresses between different customers.

This is the first time I disagree with the great Antonopoulus. I think it is fine that an ETF could be made over bitcoin. It doesn't change anything in bitcoin. Of course I will not buy in that ETF, I always prefer to have my keys well stored in my hardware wallet. But if someone wants to build something onto bitcoin, why should that be bad ? Even if the builder is an evil gov or company. This is what permisionless is about.

"Please note that this feature is still in Beta. Use at your own risk! For that reason the maximum deposit amount is capped to 100 Satoshis per transaction for now." 
WTF 100 satos per transaction ? Is this a joke or simply spam from Vaultoro ?

Txindex not needed anymore to run a LN node

Cheaper wife ? I don't think so. There is a common say here: "who fucks paying, ends up saving"

It is funny you use the excuse of "fighting Governments" when indeed this is to HELP governments, illegal ones actually whose leaders have stolen lots of money form catalan people (Pujol, Mas, etc)

That's totally false. They are not political prisoners. They have violated several laws.

It is for sure for LND since version 0.5
I'm not sure about clightning and eclair but I think they never needed txindex

If you compare the feed available to the bacteria with the people pending to enter in bitcoin in the whole world then we are still far away from the collapse.

I think that this block should have been rejected by the network since it doesn't follow the rules of the consensus. AFAIK consensus says that at the current block the mining reward is 12.5 btc, not a random one &lt;= 12.5
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:14:52
I guess that it only considers the electricity consumed by the mining equipment. But there are other electrity costs for example refrigeration. It is not the same to refrigerate when you have an exterior temperature of 40º than 5º

I dont get why the transaction was sent twice. That "Somehow his laptop managed to capture the QR code on my phone " doesn't have much sense to me. His laptop would not have sent anything even capturing the QR code.

Probably he does understand bitcoin, but he needs to send that message against bitcoin for his own interest.

No you can't. Try it in any exchange and you will see it.

To manufacturate the device you are using to connect to Internet and write this post (mobile, laptop, or whatever) they have to use the same toxic chemicals and acids and minerals and resources you are talking about. The same for the cloths you are wearing and the car or transportation medium you use every day.
What about the side effects of all the stuff we use every day ?
PS: bitcoin resources used at a global scale are nothing compared to that.

It is not urgent. We still have 87 years to fix that

Look at the past recent blocks. You will see lots of transactions included with a fee of 1 sat/byte. That is what you should use, no need to pay more.

Bitcoin energy consuption is a good thing and missunderstood by most people. The more energy consumed by bitcoin the more energy needed to attack it.

Thats wrong because no miner controls 100% of mined blocks so the paid fees could be taken by another miner. Indeed although the same spammer miner get that fees payed by himself that will not allow to take another fees which would be preferible.

Capacity is the sum of local and remote for all the open channels of a node. This is so because the local and remote is only known by the connected nodes of a channel since only them know the transactions that have been made between them.
local balance != capacity
capacity = local balance + remote balance
capacity of a channel is public and known but every node
local and remote balances are only known by the 2 nodes of that channel

Hot or cold wallet ?
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:47:41
Even worse. That PoS variants can be attacked by whoever has enougth funds, now or in the past. One which had the necesary funds could attack the chain even after selling that funds.

You mean that ones that can be reversed and double spending because of their low hashrate ?

Why did you close the last time ?
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:23:14
Not constantly. Once a channel has been opened there is no need to close it. It can be used indefinitely
@_date: 2018-07-30 03:14:15
Think in a channel as a hot wallet. You can have a hot wallet charged with for example 0.5 BTC and use it multiple times until you spend all. The same can be applied to opening a channel with 0.5 BTC and then use it multiple times until depleted. If you also receive payments throught that channel it is like it being refilled. All that LN transactions only required one onchain transaction to open the channel.

" Miners control crypto supply "
That sentence is false. Supply is not controlled by anyone. Supply is fixed at a rate that nobody can change.
