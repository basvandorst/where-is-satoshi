The receiver is unknown (in fact, the address itself is the receiver), how should the message be sent?
You could relay the message on the bitcoin network, but how do you prevent spam and ddos attacks? And why should the nodes to this for you without compensation?
The best way, I can think of, would be outside of the bitcoin network: The merchant / payment provider site gives you a "address check url". The wallet need a button to check the address, asking for this url. You have to copy&amp;paste it from the web page and hit a button to send a message containing the address to that url. At this url (which can be the website of the receiver) a web API checks the address and returns true or false, which your wallet translates to a green or red marker for the address.
If wallets and payment providers want to do this, they can. It's not that hard and has nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol.

You have to decrypt the keys to use it, at that moment, they are in your computers RAM and can be read by any malware.
hw wallet = the keys never leave that device; you send a message (transaction) to the device, it displays it and if you confirm, the device signs the message/transaction. You send the signed, unencrypted message to the network. The keys are never in your RAM and the device can not send secret data (your keys) to its "evil master".

I consider myself left leaning, because I agree with the creation of equal chances by universal education and health care and the reduction in unequality between ethnic groups, genders, social background etc.
I don't want to make everyone to an equal, but unfree drone of a collectivistic hive mind controlled by an elite. I was born in East Germany and had enough of that. I believe, that every human can develop his individual potential in freedom, be it above or below average, if treated fairly.
Nothing and nobody is perfect. People will try to cheat with their taxes or other obligations, with or without Bitcoin. Governments will do stupid things and fail to represent its sovereign, the people. Because of that, I want limitations in both directions. I don't want to dismantle the state, but I don't want it to have the power over information and possibilities to control money peemptively.
Employers won't start to pay their workers in Monero and lie to the authorities about it. And if they do, they will get caught from time to time and face severe consequences. Kinda risky.

Lightning is a different protocol than bitcoin blockchain, it builds on top. To open a lightning channel, you have to lock bitcoin in a special blockchain transaction. A little bit like prepaid stuff, but the payment channel is two-way. Imagine an abacus with different rows of pearls. Each row is a channel, starting with all pearls on the side of the initiator. But the pearls can move in both ways. If you close the channel, the final state is written on the blockchain.
Everyone can open a channel to everyone, no banks needed. But companies like payment providers will have many open channels, so you can use them without writing to the blockchain too often.

People run on banks, when they realize, that they don't control the money thay have given their bank and fear, they won't get it back. With bitcoin, you have control over your money, as long as you control the the keys.
If a currency tanks, it's called hyperinflation and the government won't step in to save you from that. Because the government caused it by printing money to pay it's debt. It has to continue or the state has to default.
Bitcoin can not hyperinflate in that way, because nobody can simply decide to print more.
Can the bitcoin price tank? Yes, because it's driven by the market alone. You can loose money (fiat money), but there has to be a very good reason for the market to drive the price down to zero.
There could be a fundamental flaw in the system, but Bitcoin had a multi billion dollar bounty on it's head for years, why did no one discover it yet? Every attack makes the system stronger and more resilient.
There could be a better system, which is accepted by more users, taking the market position a "crypto currency no. 1" away from Bitcoin. Again, it did not happen until now and it's not easy, google "network effect".
Also, crypto currencies forked in the past and the minority chains did not drop to zero immediatly, most stabilized over time at a lower level.

In short: Random numbers in computing are not random, because every algorithm must be deterministic. Random number generators start with a number (seed) and produce numbers which appear randomly distributed in the value range. But the same seed will always produce the same set of numbers.
The recovery phrase is a seed (everything is a number for computers, even words) and the rules, how to generate keys from the set of numbers are fixed for every currency (Bitcoin:  ), so the client will always generate the same infinite set of keys and adresses, that can be scanned to rebuild your wallet. The client will stop scanning after it found f.e. 20 adresses in a row, that have never been used.

New bitcoin are created with every block as miner reward. After every {fixed number} of blocks, the reward is halved and rounded down. So, after a knwon number of blocks, the reward will be zero and no more bitcoin will be created.
It is mathematically proven that there can be no more than 21 million bitcoin.
The number of blocks for the halving and the halving rule itself is artificial, but enforced by every node. No block breaking this rule will be valid and accepted by other nodes.

Litecoin was number 2 coin in 2013 already and no single advantage over bitcoin was added since then.

It's difficulty oscillates and so does it's block rate. Yesterday, they had 13 blocks total, only 2 of those in the second half of the day.

Physical bitcoins can not be splitted, if there is a fork. I had several Bitcards, but had to destroy them to split from BCH.
If those coins are not splitted, you would have to know on which chains they exist and add their value together. And if you trade them, the other person has to accept that combination of coins.
IMHO forking killed physical bitcoins.

I think, it can also be the other way around. For a "top 1% adress" you need less than 10 BTC. I have about 10 active adresses, one qualifies as "top 1%", the other 9 have together less than 1 BTC. That seems to be  a natural division.
One cold / paper storage and smaller value adresses for different purposes. I don't like to mix different purpose transactions together for privacy reasons.

You own Bitcoin by controlling the private key, that lets you sign messages associated with that Bitcoin tokens. You can use that to prove ownership or transfer to any another address (controlled by another key), even at conditions met in the future. You can put a smart contract on the blockchain.
What you don't own: A promise of fiat currency.
You can hope for that, but you don't own it.

You own Bitcoin, if you alone control the private keys.
If you don't control the private keys, you don't own Bitcoin.
If you "have BTC there", you are granted an account with a number of units on terms and conditions you have no control over. If there is a disagreement over "what Bitcoin is", Coinbase is free to choose every interpretion of their liking and associate that with your account. They decide, what that number of units in your account means for you.
If there is a split, every Bitcoin will exist on both chains. If you own your Bitcoin, you own them on both chains. If you don't, someone else decides what you can get from your account. Most probably only one kind. Maybe you can later claim from the other chain, but that's not up to you to decide.

You are sending to 2 adresses. If someone is watching your adress, he has to guess, which address is your change, and which is the address you are sending to. But that is not security, it is privacy.
By spending from an address, you have to publish your public key. Before that, only the Hash160 of the public key is known (it is the address itself). If crypto is broken and your private key could be derived from your public key, the hashing would be a second layer of security. By reusing an address, you give that 2nd layer up.

Your customer makes an order of some kind. Via Email, online shop with API or OpenBazaar (  ), doesn't matter. He decides, what he wants, where to deliver and communicates it to you / your API (Webshop). So you have all information, before payment starts. That is the standard for every kind online shopping, in any currency.
Only after this, an payment adress is created and your customer is advised to deposit x BTC to this adress. You can do this manually and send it by mail, most probably some API or openbazaar does this for you. The customer pays, you send your product.
At Open Bazaar and other marketplaces, there is also escrow and moderation. This means, the customer sends his money to an adress, which is controlled by 3 keys and 2 are needed to move it. You, the customer and a moderator own the keys. If you send your product, you sign the transaction to get the money. If the customer receives the product, he will sign and the transaction is commited. If nothing happens and there is no dispute, the moderator will sign and give you the money after some time, assuming the customer is only lazy or wandered off. If the customer disputes the trade, the moderator can, well moderate. 2 of 3 keys are needed for a solution.

Bitcoin is not perfect, but no altcoin is flawless either.
Early altcoins like Litecoin simply changed some variables and / or the hashing algorithm. That is not enough to overcome the first mover advantage.
Some coins, who have innovations and a promising development today, had a difficult or flawed start (like the DASH / Darkcoin instamine). They need time to prove themself and build trust.
Also, it may differ from person to person, what is to be considered "the best digital currency". If some want Lightning network, some prefer bigger blocks, others want to have smart contracts or strong anonymity by default... you can't have all of that, so there is no majority moving in one direction.
Bitcoin is the the common ancestor and standard implementation, everyone can live with Bitcoin. After all these years with a billion dollar bounty on it's head it can be considered safe. And there is no rule to use one crypto currency only. Why not use different coins for different purposes and Bitcoin as gateway to and central hub between them? That's exactly, what allows new and innovative currencies to exist, prove themself and grow.

1. Every wallet, that let's you control the private keys. Those should be fine: (Choose your wallet)[
2. I own a Ledger Nano S. It uses a Chrome App on PC, works like every wallet, but the Ledger has to be plugged in an unlocked via PIN. To send BTC, I have to confirm the transaction on the device itself (it has a small display) and the device will sign the transaction. The private keys never leave the device and are not exposed to the PC or any possible malware. Like with most wallets, there is a recovery seed (12 to 24 words) that can be used, if the hardware device is lost. That also has never left the device, you write it down on paper.
4. Why should it go down? Usage in real world trade makes it more useful and trustworthy. I use Bitcoin for real payments since it was $8. I bought more after that.
Amazon would probably sell their BTC, but more people would buy to use it. There are billions of people who don't have access to Paypal or VISA, not even bank accounts.

I don't know Coinbase, but it is really easy:

If the chain splits and you have the private keys, you own Bitcoin on both chains.

The Leger Wallet App allows you to switch to the BCH Chain, so you can use it as BCH Client. You don't need a seperate wallet.

The downside is, that Bitcoin looses trust and BTC value gets diluted. Money never really comes from thin air or cease to exist. It goes from one pocket to another.
If you sell at the right time, you will probably get some "free money". The lost trust and diversivication will decraese the value of BTC a little bit, but in the end you will probably be fine.
Those, wo can't move and sell the new coin will pay for it, together with those, who will not understand what is happening and make poor choices.
Maybe the bad press and lost trust caused by the fork will bring more harm, than the new coin is worth, and everyone looses.

To adopt segwit, one has to move bitcoin to a segwit adress by a non-segwit transaction. 100% adoption can only be achieved, if every pre-segwit coin has moved at least once. Which will probably never happen.
I moved all my wallets already to split from BCH and have no intention to move them again just for the sake of it. With normal usage it will take at least one year to move all to segwit adresses. My first segwit transaction will be in a month or so.

I am not sure, what results you are after, but the last page is really strange. You asked before, when and why someone has bought bitcoin in the past and then you asked the same for the future.
"Would you buy bitcoin in the future" is a very broad question. The only people answering "No" would be those, who are not interested in bitcoin and won't participate in your survey (or do it just for trolling).
The reasons on the other hand are very vague. If you know the reasons for buying Bitcoin, why do it some time in the future and not now?

If you live in a village with only 1 bus driving to the next city every day, which is only 15% full, would you prefer to have only one ride every week to get the bus full? But, how do people get to work every day?
It's not working that way. Full or empty block, they need the same hashing power. And we need blocks every 10 minutes, or confirmation time rises. Also, if we run at 10% hashing power and one block every 2 hours, miners from the other chain could execute 51% attacks.
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:35:35

Nothing. Bitcoin won't work on that island, because it does not have the mining infrastructure to mine blocks. And if it had, it would not be profitable and surely not decentralized. To get the difficulty to change, you need thousands of blocks. If that island had 1% of the global hashing power, you would have 1,5 blocks per day for years.
On an island of 5000 people it would be more suitable to move cash around. Without electronic communication to the outside, there is no need for an electronic payment system, especially if it is that slow.

All my grandparents (from different regions) at some day in their live received a similar letter from their government or local provisional authorities. That letter ordered them to leave their homes and hand over everything they own except 5 parts of plain clothing, enough food and water for 3 days and assemble at the nearest train station for deportion.
They themself managed to flee and survive, but some had see their siblings starve to death in one of the largest cities of the so called civilized world, because they could not afford food or a train ticket to another place.
When my grandmother asked me about Bitcoin a week ago, I could not explain the technology. I explained to her, that it is some kind of bank account without bank, accessible from every country that has some kind of electronic communication with the outside and is not seizable by any government. She understood and told me again her story. If the same thing that happened to her happens again, I want to be able to protect my family.
I don't care about the average Joe, but since 2011 I used 40% of every Bitcoin I owned to purchase stuff, mostly food, because some day my live or that of my daughter could depend on a working, decentralized global currency.
