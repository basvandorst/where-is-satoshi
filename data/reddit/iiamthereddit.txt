I've given it a go, I make a new wallet, restore with the seed words and select a 2fa wallet. I click "i've lost my 2fa code" it asks for my seed words again and then crashes?  
Any idea why?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:21:55
Do I simply delete the wallet, then restore using the seed words?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:48:39
Updated my electrum and its all working. Thanks so much!  
Only problem im having now is that I set too low a fee ��
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:18:12
I don't understand what you mean?  
Can I simply delete the wallet and recover it with my seed words?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:13:53
I have my seed words, but don't have a backup wallet file I dont think
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:12:47
Sound pretty sensitive to me.  
In the UK we call it banter, best get used to it, as you seem to have some rather thin skin.

I play in the hole, a CAM.  
Was during a preseason friendly, player scissor challenged my standing leg, twisted and popped my knee. I played on until it popped another 2 times at which point i couldn't walk on it anymore.  
Not the best decision I've ever made ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:16:12
A loan lmao
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:20:40
A joke. It was a joke.  
Try not to be so sensitive on the internet please..
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:32:54
My take on it is that there's no absolute maximum the the price can reach when increasing, but in the other direction theres a very definite bottom.  
We know bitcoin can only ever drop 0-100%  
So a 40% drop is nearly halfway to the max it can drop - absolutely nothing.  
When the price rises 1000% its of course incredible, but:  
A) Spread out over a much longer period of time.  
B) Has no way to compare to the absolute max it will reach.  
  
If we knew the increase this year was 80% of the max price btc would reach we'd be going crazy, but ofc thats not possible, and we're a greedy animal.  
Its in our nature to always want more than we have

Oh, not the band. Im not a sadist..
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:30:46
Exactly this. My first ever bitcoin purchase was at 2900. Thought I made a terrible mistake. Stopped religiously checking. After a few months i'm now in the green :) Just be patient, your money isn't going anywhere anytime soon
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:00:43
Cheers. Fuck me for asking a question right?  
There really a need to be such an asshole about it?
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:14:16
You're a cunt.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:30:15
To be fair that probably makes you one of the best day traders on this sub-reddit
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:54:57
Wish I was awake for that, happened 6am here.  Being a student on a sunday meant I didnt wake up until 11 to see the opportunity I missed ��
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:56:33
Looks like it belongs on displate. Really cool!
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:26:12
Lmao look at my post history bud.  
I've only posted on r/btc once and that was, (after segwit2x got cancelled), to rub it in the face of a Bcash supporter who claimed bitcoin was 100% gonna die.  
You're acting absolutely pathetic.  
Infact I'm pretty sure you're a troll, or a kid who has too much free time on the weekends so you sit on reddit and try and elicit reactions from people 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:23:02
I know.  
It was a pretty blatant manipulation attempt. But it just got me thinking is all
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:04:21
At this point he's surely cashed out a lot to be filthy rich already, right?  At this point he must be just doing it because he's bored lmao.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:03:22
Don't know why you're being so toxic.  
Is it so hard to look at things objectively and see different coins have pros and cons?  
When I look at this subreddit and the btc subreddit all I see are people like you who think anyone with an opposing opinion are evil.  
fyi - 100% bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:25:48
Lmao what?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:59:50
Sleep &gt; BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:55:44
Jesus fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:00:21
So if I understand correctly, the "red band" in this case is a zone of backed up transactions which aren't being processed because their fees are too low?  
In this example its beneath 10 sat/byte
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:55:29
I dont think you have enough notifications
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:52:09
That's an eye-watering amount of money
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:42:25
Same lmao
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:58:57
Lmao no I dont. I'm asking a hypothetical, I didn't sell at all during the weekend. infact I bought £100 more ;)
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:57:09
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:00:30
Yeah I think I clearly don't quite have a grasp on how the market works. I was thinking that GDAX represented all buy/sell orders, so I guess I figured a 25k dump would cause chaos. But obviously I'm dont have a proper understanding :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:11:06
Interesting. So what If him, Jihan and C wright dumped ALL of their bitcoin and then bought as much BCH as they could. Admittedly a super risky strategy, but if it doesn't work i'm sure they'd still be filthy rich. Although I realistically only see that being their last ditch attempt to dethrone BTC, which I dont think would work, but then again I dont really know how much BTC they own or how the market works
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:19:09
Ah gotcha. Do you know if there's a site which takes into account all the data from the largest exchanges and forms a substantial graph of all buy/sell orders. That'd be pretty dope to see, not particularly useful admittedly, but would be pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:38:06
Same, been waiting for it to drop for a week or so.  
Got impatient and bought now just incase it keeps rising, but if it crashes I'll be just as happy :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:02:56
Ah yeah, i wasn't thinking in terms of market cap, just saw buy/sell orders and obviously dont quite understand the economics of this.  So what If he put up a 25k sell wall on a single exchange but only used it to manipulate the price, taking it down before it gets hit? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:12:01
Ah, I understand now.  
Appreciate the help :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:15:30
That bearwhale stuff is pretty dope.  
If it was the case that he did cause a flash crash, would you have to sign up for the given exchange he dumped it all on and verify everything hoping that the price was still low by the time you were signed up?  
Just worried I might miss out on cheap coins now :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:03:20
I bought  Just hit my account at 7140.  
lmao, just my luck.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:14:16
If i hold coins on coinbase? Should I consider selling? Tbh im not familiar with the tech of bitcoin at all, so apologies if I'm asking a completely unrelated/obvious question
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:54:16
I'll look into how to make a paper wallet, although I'm completely clueless at the moment
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:18:03
Just a question. I held my bitcoin on coinbase during Aug 1st, and have since transferred the BTC to an electrum wallet. Will coinbase still have a hold of my BCH? Or should i be able to find it in my electrum wallet somehow?
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:35:24
Feel free to not answer, but how many bitcoins did you end up mining in the early days?  
Im always interested in wondering what itd have been like if I started mining bitcoin when it all started.  
Either way I presume you're pretty comfortable financially 
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:58:24
Thanks, I'll take a look into it!
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:44:24
Actually might give this a go.  
Wanted to scrub up on my html css anyway
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:12:41
I do plan on educating myself, but atm my studies, (which is ironically computer science), takes priority
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:26:36
Yeah, I was looking about in the setting on my wallet and saw it was displaying my balance in mBTC, not dollars as I thought it might, hence the edit.  
Regardless, thanks for the reply
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:04:34
Yeah, that'll do it
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:06:59
Main ones would be cracking the encryption, if someone finds P=NP in some miraculous stroke of genius god help anything encryption related, as well as quantum computing seeing dramatic improvements, but neither should you really be worried about.
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:25:41
Wait so what if i put up $10 margin on 100x leverage. If i get liquidated I lose $10, if it goes up I make an asstonne of money?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:16:57
Anyone know of more reliable sites?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:56:39
I bought £40 worth of bitcoin and £30 worth of ethereum yesterday.
Only problem I had was my bank locking my account as they wanted to check one of the transactions wasn't fraudulent. So a minor inconvenience at worst, for me anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:04:57
Im with nationwide.
I purchased mine through coinbase and just told the geezer on the other end it was stocks, he seemed satisfied with that explanation.
I highly doubt anything bad will happen to your account tbh, I suspect those are fri ge cases when people have their banks closed for it.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:50:16
lmao I got in at $2906 Rip.
As soon as coinbase is up tho im buying up loads
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:51:38
Unfortunately I'm a student so dont have proof of residence or my passport with me. Bit cheeky, but know any other sites that would require only a drivers license for verification, that I could register for right now?
