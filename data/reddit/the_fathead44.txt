Haha yeah, ETC is definitely getting overshadowed by BTC and LTC.

Same here!  I just wish I would've bought into it a little more back then lol.

Yeah, I'm still hodling my little nugget of LTC lol it seems like another big jump is right around the corner for it.

It's blowing my mind

As the value of bitcoin increases, egos increase with it... Some people get cocky because they're making extremely easy money with little to no effort, and they don't know how to handle it.
It's like that annoying friend that may babysit kids without having a child of their own, but they'll take every opportunity to tell others about how difficult it is to raise kids, or what they need to be doing to with their children.
Making easy money on BTC and experiencing financial success doesn't automatically make someone an expert in BTC and cryptocurrencies... but that won't stop those people from thinking they are.

Dude, I'm ready to cash out what little I have in ETC and move it over to BTC... I may actually see some growth with that lol.

Nice!  I'm still holding off on moving my LTC out because I want to see what happens with it, and my overall investment and gains are pretty small still since I don't have the extra funds to throw at it all just yet, so hodling isn't really making much of a difference... but the rocket that is BTC is definitely calling my name lol.

I'm right there with ya... I'm checking the charts every night before bed, and I now check them the moment I wake up.  GDAX is beginning to monopolize my time and attention like Reddit has for all of these years lol.

Someone told me that the bubble would burst, and that it was filled with butt toots.
