What's the difference between Bech32 and non-bech32 segwit addresses?
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:30:21


I wouldn't transfer this amount with LN! Not even 0,01btc to be honest.

Dude. The price of a single coin has nothing to do with potential growth. Just look at the market cap, not a single coin price. For example ARK, WTC or MOD are coins which are $5+ and have a low cap and are considered fairly cheap atm (not an investment advice btw). ADA is around $0.5 and has a really high cap. 
It’s all about the final limit of amount of coins, with your theory the best investment is DOGE.

And they’ll do this again and again and again. Every time they do this BTC came out stronger. And those guys made a lot of money. Still a HODLer like me can laugh about these rises and falls.

Just give them affiliate links and you actually will get BTC out of it ��

He doesn’t even HODL

Done and good luck with your research!

Still if you bought at around ATH I wouldn’t worry too much. Those bankers will pump the hell out of BTC again and we’ll reach a new ATH. It’ll just take a little longer.  Nobody can say when it happens. For all I know it can happen next month already because it’s rather lucrative for those whales to do this.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:41:13
Great opportunity to buy at zero. Can’t wait!

Don’t know where you’re from but in the Netherlands it’s best to use litebit or bitmymoney.

Does Segwit limit the blocksize?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:15:00
I’ll start a pizza shop specially for selling you 2 pizzas for that amount of btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:48:10
Exactly what I was thinking

Hide your private key otherwise your friends will sweep that crazy amount of money from you ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:20:18
I own some from when it was $100. My dad is telling me to sell every other day. My answer every time is that it’ll be worth 10x more one day and he laughs at me. In the meanwhile I own btc an he doesn’t. Just HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:49:42
You should have used Doge instead

Where to get this metal plates (in the right shape)?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:30:15
Or people get sick and tired of current transaction fees/times, dump and never look back. Most people don’t care for some technical updates like LN.
It’s all speculation. I just hodl and see where we’ll get. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:26:01
I did put in ~€70 4 years ago. Never regretted it (I also didn’t own a lot of money at that time). If in 4 years time the bitcoin value is risen you can laugh about, if its worth nothing anymore, you can still laugh about it (by then your initial investment is probably nothing to you anymore). Good luck hodling!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:57:32
Not at all. I’m hodling since 2013. Just saying it can go either way.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:05:45
Yup, probably that. 
I actually only expected a thank you. But when traveling on a shoestring budget every bit of money could have helped. Just taking the money and returning the rest of the stuff to the police would be so much easier.
Probably will do the same next time, but still would think about it a little longer I guess and maybe take a little finders fee. Now I’m in a much better economic situation. But returning $1m of BTC w/o knowing the sender? No way. (Almost) no one will do that.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:27:38
What about the tx fees?
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:37:17
People just make mistakes and learn by making them. They are autonomous beings and they can choose who to listen to.
I was trying to be a Bitcoin prophet myself 4 years ago, but gave up soon after everybody was laughing about it. Since then I didn’t talk about Bitcoin until somebody asked me about it (which happened maybe on 3 occasions). You are totally right about everybody suddenly wants to get into the game as well, but I say to everybody: “research before you buy, know what you buy” and I gladly explain the basics, but I never advice to buy cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:19:46
Well, you sound like you think you’re kind of a Bitcoin elite yourself.

Also easy for when I’m dead my relatives don’t have to buy a gravestone anymore.

Found somebody’s fanny pack with (Italian) passport, a lot of money (around €1000,-), credit cards, really expensive wallet and medicine somewhere in the east of Russia near Mongolia. Because you can’t travel in Russia without your passport and a new passport can only be retrieved in Moscow it would really suck for him if it wasn’t returned. 
Jumped thru lots of hoops to return it to the owner, spend a whole day of my holiday on it. When the guy finally got his wallet he was sort of angry at me and went away without a thanks.
So lesson learned, next time I help such a rich asshole I will claim my reward in advance.
Luckily I got a lot of karma points out of it I could spend the rest of the holiday ��.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:11:38
Who cares if the wallet dies? Just keep that seed and buy a cheap wallet again. I rather get a cheap wallet then a expensive bombproof one.

Sorry to break it to you but you are also new to BTC.

Guess this is the problem of everybody using the same exchange. I already sold all my BCH (and BTG) on Binance weeks ago.

I dont want a OS from an advertising company which robs me from my privacy (android). Ripping out all google from android leaves you with a useless device. 
Believe me, I tried, really hard. 
So that’s why I switched to iOS last year.
Good luck with having all your personal data on the street in return of an ‘open’ (which isn’t that open at all) device.
