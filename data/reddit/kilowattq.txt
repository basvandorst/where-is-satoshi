well that's not a bad idea but if I win some more money, I still don't have a wallet that will accept my bitcoins from a gambling site since Coinbase closed my account.  What wallets do accept that?  And Gyft isn't a bad idea once in a while but I don't want to spend my money on gift cards everytime

Oh ok well yeah I should have explained a little better...If i dont put a credit card on file, it takes 4 days...that is very inconvienient to be honest with you..I know I could stop my whining And put one on file but I honestly dont want too...so you believe that most all exchanges require that?

Well I don't know how other bitcoin casinos work, but SatoshiBet has an address that I deposit my money into to start gambling, but I have withdrawn winning a couple of times now and I always create a new address to send to.  But whenever my transaction is pending, it says that you are receiving bitcoin from an unknown account or something along those lines, so I don't know how they know. They are letting me keep the money in there but In order to use it or covert it to USD, they say I have to send it to a different bitcoin wallet because they are no longer doing business with me.  It's just weird because I know thousands of people gamble using bitcoin, so what wallets do they use?

lol not at all trying to advertise.  I kicked some ass last night though and was excited to convert my bitcoins into USD, I sent Coinbase an email pretty much kissing their ass like they wanted so hopefully i can still use them, but I mean if I win, send it to blockchain.info, then send it to coinbase, coinbase won't know then?  Cuz if they do still decide to do business with me after they  read my heartfelt message, i imagine that would be my one and only mulligan.

Ok well that definitley sums it up for me.  I do like Coinbase so far though all I have done was sign up and link to my bank, but they just threw me off with the credit card thing in order for fast purchases. Kind of inconvenient when I dont have a credit card and my bank card isnt accepted...I guess its time I sign up for a credit card though..I just didnt know if there were better options but it doesnt sound like it
