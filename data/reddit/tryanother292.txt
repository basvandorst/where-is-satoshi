Nice and steady increase in adoption is exactly what bitcoin needs.  It gives folks confidence.  Hopefully we don't have a bunch of newcomers get on board only to panic sell and drop the price scaring the market.  Silly newbies.  They should all just buy 10 bucks worth to get the hang of it before committing money they are scared to lose.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:24:25
If bitcoin can't be changed then we might as well all fucking abandon it now.  This kind of view is fucking dumb.
I'll tell you something else that is going to have to change.  When zerocoin comes out it will QUICKLY move to the top to of coinmarketcap.com and bitcoin is going to have to make a choice as to whether to implement this protocol or not.  It's going to be all about demand I suppose.  Litecoin will definitely NOT be number 2 anymore that's for sure.

The main point is when average people buy bitcoin, you shouldn't make the large USD figure prominent.  They will think they are too expensive.
Perhaps add  1000 bits/ubtc  $.57
People will buy 1000 of something for 57 cents a lot more readily than 1 of something for 570 dollars.

Dumb ass...rules result from a free market--even unwritten rules.  Over time, this is EXACTLY what will happen.  Miners will learn that allowing any pool to go over 30% is bad for bitcoin.  It will drive the price down and their profits.

Given your STEM degree that you seem so proud of, I would have thought that you would understand this paragraph better.


The point is people HAVE to spend money to acquire services and products.  There will be no one group that can replenish the traded money from this acquisition without doing work themselves or actually providing something to mankind.  Given enough time, prices will naturally align with value.  Work has more value than it is currently rewarded with including your STEM skill.  That is, if you actually provide a service to mankind.  If you just have a degree and are only good at running your mouth on the Internet but can't really see the big picture in many things then probably not.
As for burger flipping, obviously market demand will still not pay that skill as much as a neuro-surgeon.  
Have you ever stopped to think that maybe you aren't paid what you're really worth?  Do you really believe that those with 90% of the wealth do 90% of the thinking/work?  
So, the easiest way for me to get you to understand this is to get you to ask yourself what happens in a world where people no longer have an unfair advantage with social connections to money creators?  What happens when the very few with 90% of the wealth can't maintain this value without providing a service to mankind.  I'll tell you what happens.  People start getting paid what they are worth.  The gap between the rich and the poor goes back to pre-1970 levels.  Take the time to look that up by the way.  Look up the gap between the rich and the poor between the period of modern worker rights, 1930ish, and the early 1970s.  
A truly fair currency will lift most boats, burger flipper and engineer alike.

@_date: 2014-06-01 12:26:02
One more thought for you.  In a bitcoin world, the money people get for simple work--cutting grash, washing dishes, flipping burgers--is rewarded with a currency that goes UP in value.  This is a VERY motivating factor.  Many people will be FAR more inclined to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps when they realize they can actually do it with hard work and saving--as it should be.
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:15:31
Hahaha...oops.  That's too funny.  I was thinking about putting 100 bits at 6 cents but decided 6 cents just seems like too little to spend.  I changed it to 1000 bits but forgot to update the price.

Perhaps because I'm an early adopter and I know what I did and I understand the desire to secure your wealth.  
Most early adopters have already cashed out.  The VERY early adopters with a ton of coins are doing what you suggest because they've already secured hard assets and have btc left.

You know...the truth is people that like bitcoin and all the things it represents don't dislike this guy for his prediction.  What we dislike is he has actively been promoting AGAINST bitcoin.  He would lecture people on the evils of bitcoin in an attempt to convince as many people as possible.
The question is WHY?  Did he do that to help his prediction come true?  I don't think so.  I don't think he really cares.
He's one of those guys in an influential position that just seemed TOO motivated to stand against bitcoin.  It really appeared like something else was pushing him to do it.  Maybe that sounds crazy but that's my gut feel.
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:32:17
It's time for ALL miners to abandon EVERY large pool right now.  The community needs to make a pact to only join pools that are at around 5-10% of network capacity.

Yes, I do.  Most people will have traded a lot of the original coins by then with VERY few having even a whole bitcoin.
As adoption increases, so to will the price.  You simply can't have one without the other.
I agree we should focus on adoption.
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:24:57
Very interesting.  Thanks for the explanation.  Now, you've listed it's strengths.  Can you be objective and list it's weaknesses?
It's very hard to establish trust especially since most people don't understand the technical side of things in bitcoin.  Why should it be trusted?  How do we know it's not just another pump and dump scamcoin as esterbrae is saying?
Thank you for your time.
@_date: 2014-06-22 20:19:01
I believe it will replace the dollar.  Possibly not in this time frame though.  Once enough people start using it.  Once people understand that certain groups create as much money as they like now and are the primary ones to benefit from that.

Apparently it works.  That's all I can tell you.  I don't give a shit if bitcoin uses GoldCoin's mechanism or not.  
I just want them to fix this dumbass begging problem AND the problem with having to beg people to run nodes.
Bottom line, any time the community has to be begged to "help" bitcoin, a technical solution needs to be put in place.
Folks can criticize the GoldCoin mechanism all they want...it works and they aren't on here begging for Ghash.io not to go over 51%.

Actually you are quite wrong.  Most miners want to get as many bitcoins as possible WITHOUT harming their long term prospects.  A bitcoin network with problems harms their long term prospects and the value of bitcoin goes down--which is also harmful to them.
The only people that benefit are a few sneaky bad actors.
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:13:11
Why don't people understand that early adopters will "cash out" into hard assets?  I can't understand that thinking.  Yeah, I'm a nerd with 1000 bitcoins and I'm just going to hold onto them until they are worth a million a piece.  THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN.  People want to ensure there gains.  They will buy houses, stock, etc.  They already have done this.  Heck there was that reached the top 10 here a few days ago where a lot of them explained how they had tens of thousands of bitcoins run through their hands but currently only have 5 or so.

Of course the solution is for the miners to go elsewhere...driving ghash.io out of business.  Then another ghash.io will pop up because people are fucking stupid.  Eventually folks will realize that 30% or around there should be a cap and this WILL happen.  It's better that it happens sooner than later. 
Once this happens any pool that goes over 30% will be deemed a bad actor by the community and all miners will abandon it.
The sooner this happens, the better.

Right now money is created from thin air.  There is no limit.  There use to be a limit when the dollar was backed by gold before that was done away with in the 70s.  Ever since then, the divide between the rich and poor has increased dramatically. 
The fed and banks are the only groups that create money.  If you were in control of this systems who would you give loans to?  It would, of course go to friends and families on a more frequent basis.  This is exactly what happens and a huge gap has been created between those associated with the banking industry and everyday workers.  They create money that ultimately benefits them the most and everyone elses money is watered down.
Ultimately this group of money creators and their friends hold all the chips.  In America, they have over 90% of the wealth from doing very little.  They hold on to this wealth while the rest of us have to live in the bounds of the remaining 10%.  If they were unable to hold onto this wealth by stripping them of the ability to create money and/or get easy loans, the money would flow to those that did the actual work and things would come into balance with work and reward.
It sounds like a conspiracy theory but this is exactly what happens.  I have to go to sleep now but if anyone asks for further explanation, I can answer in the morning.
