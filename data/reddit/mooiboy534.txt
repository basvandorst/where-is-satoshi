That's really low, Binance has a starting daily limit of 2BTC aka €28k, so you could try that

Bought 50 TH/s 2 days ago on hashflare, anyone thinks it'll still be profitable after the upcoming difficulty changes? Because I've got a feeling I made a bad decision

Lol have been doing BTC only since I was 13 and kept HODL. So got about 13btc now. Cashed some and want to buy different crypto’s. But since the prices are changing so fast, I’d rather buy them all at once instead of waiting a day all the time

People should just HODL and enjoy life

Just HODL mate

I'm sorry to say that not a single person on Earth knows the answer to this question for sure mate

And the fucker is rising again...

BTC going to the moon?

Hope that’ll work, thanks a lot mate. Btw, I’m using a nano ledger S. If I buy altcoins through Bittrex for example, will I be able to store the coins on my hardware ledger, or is it stored on the bittrex account online?

Both are good options. If you sell now, you'll have your profit and buy again in the next dip. If you HODL you'll be good too, because the next peak will be higher than this one. But it's up to you.

Binance is a fast way

Just sold my 2 BTC, it better not have been the wrong move
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:20:47
Does anyone know a place where you can buy crypto's other than BTC without having to verify your ID? (I'm 17 btw) preferably with a €5k daily limit or higher.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:43:53
Yeah, I’m going to read about that a bit more. I’m from the Netherlands, so don’t know the rules here exactly

Just put another €10k in it, now HODLing for life. Hoping the price will skyrocket
