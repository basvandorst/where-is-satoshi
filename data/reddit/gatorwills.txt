I don't know enough about a Roth and what happens when you roll that over with them.
I do know that Fidelity doesn't let you have an IRA in Bitcoin though so your options are rather limited.

Maybe, but they told me their minimum was $20k when I bought and the guy I worked with over there said they were overloaded with business so they couldn't lower it at the time.
12% is definitely a lot but I wanted to pay the premium to make sure its done right and I planned on hodling long-term anyway. I'm happy I did but totally understand if someone wants to try the do-it-yourself route instead. Of the full service companies out there Bitcoin IRA has by far the most reputable reviews so I'd recommend going with them if you go the full service route.

I have bitcoin and ether in my IRA and I used Bitcoin IRA. It was pretty easy.  Here was my experience: 
They are full service. You pay a premium for it, but I thought it was worth it. They took care of the paperwork, called my custodian Fidelity to rollover the funds, did the trade on the phone and moved it to bitgo. Pretty easy. 
I called around beforehand and some other companies offer it, but they all had similar fees. One had a do-it-yourself model, but it sounded like a hassle and you risk accidentally moving your funds out of a retirement setting which could be a tax nightmare. The fees were a little cheaper but not worth it IMO.
I could pick from 6 coins to put in my IRA -- btc, eth, xrp, ltc, bch, etc. Another company, called bitira.com only offered btc and I really wanted to have a diverse portfolio of altcoins.
I paid 12.5% in fees. They told me that it's 10% with a larger investment, but I thought it was reasonable given all the steps involved. Took about 3 weeks from start to finish.
Hope that helps!
