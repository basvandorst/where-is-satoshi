Really don't see the comparison here. Fiat-vs-bitcoin is not the same as the commodity-based money that Gresham or Copernicus was theorizing about.

It is poor shaming.
AA didn't advise people to INVEST in bitcoin.
He talks about the distruptive potential of bitcoin and trashes the existing order. That is not the same thing as giving people investment advice.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:25:35
Developers give their time and effort to make bitcoin work.
Roger does a copy and paste of their work and then trash talks those same developers. He's basically stealing their work. 
It's a pity that the law governing open source software don't afford equal protection, but that doesn't make it less unethical.

Can you provide more detail in layman's terms?

That's what some say about Lighting Network, it consists of hubs that are centralization. But i've read that people can create their own hubs or can connect to different hubs. Here is a response to that narrative:
Anyway, it would be kind of ironic to cite centralization in Lighting network while at the same time driving centralization via block size increases.

Roger isn't giving friendly advice. He's trying to discredit AA.
Roger is an ass and fully deserves the hate he invites.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:37:28
There is a saying "the law is an ass". Just because something isn't legal or illegal does not make it ethical or moral.

Trace Mayer is a bigger whale and entered the space before Roger did. You might want to check him out for comparison: 
 
As for Roger and friends, it was up to them to win the community to their side of the scaling debate. They failed to do that.
Roger lies, he claims he was the first big investor in Bitcoin, he wasn't.
Trace was there before Roger.

digitalcitizenfund.org is a charity that pays bitcoin to girls in Afghanistan. Are there other things like this?

Roger also goes around trashing Bitcoin core devs, basically because they have a different opinion regarding bitcoin scaling then he does.
Roger says the most vindictive things.
In March 2016, Eric Lombrozo (one of the core devs) wrote a letter to Roger to try and calm things down, Roger totally ignored it and persists in his crazy and inflamatory narrative.
You can find the letter on pastebin (direct ink isn't working for me) LetterToRoger - Pastebin.com

Fraud isn't fundamental nor free market.
It's actually theft.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:02:33
I'm quoting a Bitcoin core dev - Eric Lombrozo
1)Fast, chean on-chain transactions
2)Secure, censorship-resistant txs
3)Widespread adoption
Choose only two (unless you can break the laws of physics)

Besides, how much debt was he carrying and how much support did his family need? You can hardly judge someone's money management without knowing their inputs and outputs.

Whatever AA said is irrelevant here.
If something is "poor shaming" or not; refers to the INTENT of Rogers post. It's quite clear his intent is to discredit AA via a cynical use of AA's earlier post.

If Bcash supporters believe that, then surely Bitcoinclashic is the 'real' bitcoin since it's still running the original rules of BCH.
Bcach forked their rules, so it's a fork of a chain that forked off bitcoin now
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:38:35
because if we kick the can down the road it will take developer time away from the real solutions (Layer2).
Plus we'd end up with greater centralization and a lot more 'entitled' CEO's that believe they control Bitcoin.

WASHINGTON—Bitcoin’s partisans and foes argue endlessly about the skyrocketing price of the asset and how it should be regulated. The cryptocurrency has even sparked a feud between a senior Wall Street regulator and a top union official. The spat occurred Thursday at the Securities and Exchange Commission, where Republican SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar chastised the [Bitcoin expert]
Does anybody have the rest of the story?

Oh ok, show us the overwhelming community consensus for bigger blocks.

Signalling is not the same as voting/supporting.
Signalling is preparing for a possible change. That was proved during 2x. People saw miners signalling and presumed that was the same thing as miners voting for 2x, it wasn't.

Are you familiar with this paper? 
I think it puts the bitcoin scaling issue into context.
I don't think it's elitist, the people that commit their personal time and effort into coding this open source project are the ones i think are worth willing to listening to.
Roger Ver and some CEO's have built companies based on this notion of 'free transactions' but there was always a cost to running and securing the network. That cost was being paid for by currency inflation / miner reward.
Number of Bitcoins is capped so at some point no coins get rewarded.
Transaction Fees are the inevitable state for a self sustaining network if we don't plan on inflating bitcoin supply.
In my opinion the bitcoin network needs to scale, and it needs to be done right. Not in a way that will long term damage it via a state-backed attack on it. In order to preserve censorship-resistance it's imperative to keep the network efficient, lightweight which can be done with small blocks.

he's scamming people by attempting to fraudently co-opt the Bitcoin name. He then tries to fool new users who believe they are buying bitcoin but end up with bcash.
He's also spinning a highly partisan and false narrative to try and turn people away from bitcoin and toward his pet project "bcash".
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:45:27
i believe that you don't have to use LN, and you can chose to transact on the 'premium chain' (bitcoin), but that you'll have to be willing to pay the transaction fee
Anyway, wouldn't it be easier for a state to attack a centralized mining operation then hundreds of LN hubs?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:30:21
His motive is money. He can't call his new coin "RogerCoin", nobody would buy it. He didn't get his way over the bitcoin scaling debate so behaves like an entitled little brat, taking his toys and running home then feigning victim.

We can separate Money from Government without collapsing society into a darwinian survival of the fittest 'global free market'.

Looking for keys is fine, however it certainly is theft if they are taking coins. There is no way a user could possibly know if their private key was truly randomly generated. It's not an apt comparison.
Imagine if a large company can simply start using a smaller companies brand and logo to take their business away from them. That's an abuse, people know the difference.
In this case it's a smaller group (bcash) trying to piggy-back on the larger groups name recognition. Fraud is theft.

Bcash already hard forked and not everybody went with them. Bitcoinclashic is still running the BCH original rules.

Here have a read of this:  The Three Economic Eras of Bitcoin

Is there anything the Bitcoin community can do, to downgrade his website? Like complain to the domain registrar or sink it in google search results?
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:41:06
I called the bank at the time and they were able to confirm no money request was hitting their system from Coinbase.
I suspect it had something to do with saved password on the Coinbase applet. Like the cached pw would not persist.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:09:29
They've had a couple customer support job postings on their website for months now. I applied months ago and never heard a single response back. So make of that what you will....

What does your bank say? Might just be a Coinbase problem.

Roger Ver owns this pos.

No. "Mass adoption" means nothing if you don't have sufficient decentralization. If you don't have decentralization the entire project can be shut down by malicious actors or government.This is why BCash and big blockers are wrong, large blocks trend toward centralization.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:46:45
Sure, but it's an unknowable quantity : how much decentralization is sufficient. It's unknowable because we don't know how much resources an attacker would commit.  Not all nodes are equal though. Since Bcash has so many nodes run off Amazon AWS services and could be all shutdown by a single entity.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:32:30
It's open to debate of course.
The vast, vast majority of the bitcoin community sided with small blocks to preserve and grow that decentralization.
