You forgot the "open your eyes now!" in full caps part. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:12:43
I already know who you are. A paranoid delusional kid with asperger living in his parents basement. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:28:46
No they weren't! Stop fucking spreading false information you fucking idiot!
Someone random on this Reddit pulled that out of his ass and you idiots just keep repeating it as a bunch of brainless zombies. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 10:39:20
Not this shit again. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:36:21
Stop lying. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:34:21
You're the most boring and non funny troll i've seen in a long time. Congrats. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:44:41
He can't abd won't. He will just ignore it and move on to the next post telling us to "wake up". That's how these idiots roll. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:19:22
Yes they did you fucking moron. If only you would do some searching and reading instead of being a parrot you wouldn't look so goddamn retarded right now. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 11:02:02
Innocent till proven guilty. REMEMBER? ALLEGED lies. 
Amazing how all you morons come here to prove my point. Really amazing. The stupidity...
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:45:22
Exactly. It has become unreadable because of all the idiots posting the same stuff 30 times a day.
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:49:36
Can you dumb kids just stop making these threads please. You make look Bitcoin look so stupid. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:55:53
No. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:59:46
An insider aaaaaaaaaahahahhaaahhhhaaa!!! 
Get help. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:38:46
If there is one person in this topic that can't think for himself, it's you. You goddamn fucking moron. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 11:47:06
No idea. But good thing he is innocent till proven guilty. I learned in the Ulbricht topic that Bitcoiners find this rule extremely important. You as well right?
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:52:06
How are these hits he ordered complete fud? Because you think so?
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:20:26
Stop the reposts man. The "new" page has become worthless because all i see is the same story reposted 30 times. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 09:12:25
Ah of course. Silk Road was full of innocent friendly people who were just trading a plant. Right. 
You are high right now, aren't you?
@_date: 2014-04-22 05:36:48
Ah the good old Bitcoin circle jerk. Posting a year old quote. Only the usable part of course. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:40:41
Why the fuck should i present facts? You are the one with a false claim! How about you back up your claim. Which you can't. So i don't need to present shit. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:24:48
Thanks. Was only posted 50 times already. 
What is it with this place and all the reposts?
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:29:27
Just saying how stupid people are. China article means instant panic. Without even knowing what it says. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:29:16
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:04:48
Yes he was you fucking idiot!
And the fed bots...is this place really completely filled with 16 year old paranoid drug users or what?
Fed bots that can read which posts they need to upvote and which not. If you're not too fucking high right now then think about it for a minute. Seriously, think for a minute how insane you sound. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:11:38
Yes i can't wait to put my money there. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:04:09
Is your keyboard broken?
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:13:49
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
@_date: 2014-04-20 09:02:26
But...but...he was a Bitcoin supporter so it's all good. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:10:47
Oh let me think. Am i gonna send money to the defense of the biggest drug dealer on the internet who made an insane amount of money and tried to have people killed. Oh i just don't know what to do...
And fuck off with your not guilty until proven political correct bs! If this was a random banker you faggots would be screaming they should hang him but since he was a Bitcoin supporter all his crimes were just fine. Hypocrites. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:01:19
Why don't you post the source of your claim?
@_date: 2014-04-22 10:41:54
You are right of course. But you got downvoted anyway. You're not allowed to question the circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:34:23
It flew right over your head didn't it. 
I'm explaining how Bitcoiners are suddenly very political correct while if this was a banker they wouldn't give a shit about innocent until proven guilty. Now read this till you understand it so you won't look like an idiot again with your next reply. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 04:43:25
No way?
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:01:51
Wooooow wow wow what!??? Wtf?
What happened to innocent till proven guilty and it's up to the judge and alleged and all that other stuff that was repeated ad nauseam in the Ross Ulbricht topic??
Seriously, what the fuck? That right alleged criminals have was so goddamn fucking important in the other topic. Every second reply mentioned it. And now in this case basically everyone is saying hang him by the balls. So it DOES turn out that Bitcoiners are absolute fucking hypocrites. I would've never guessed that. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:33:15
How old are you? 20? 25? In all those years you never noticed it's lose and not loose? If that is already to difficult for you then it's no surprise you lost your coins. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:11:17
Stop spreading false info. This is a lie. A lie made up by Bitcoiners because they want to defend a fellow Bitcoiner. It's as sad as it can get. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 10:46:40
Yeah, that's why they are going after him for that. Because there is zero proof. You people are completely delusional. 
Tried to have people murdered, 
laundered insane amounts of money,
biggest drug dealer on the internet, 
probably 10 other things. 
But it's all good. He was a Bitcoin supporter so he should be a free man. 
Bitcoin is great but Bitcoiners are a bunch of total idiots. 
I just hope not too many outsiders read this page. It's a complete disgrace. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:49:50
They haven't been dropped. Stop lying. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:55:38
What's it like to look like a complete fucking idiot? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:39:20
Another i know everything and i am right post full of nothing. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:47:18
Only if the rapist used Bitcoin of course. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:38:17
Ah the idiot with "truth" in his name again. Maybe it's time for you to look back at your posting history and you'd realize you look a lot like an extremely dumb attention seeking underaged troll. If that is what you're after then by all means continue. If it's not then i suggest starting over again with a less retarded username. And obviously change your posting style. You must be about 15, am i right?
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:22:58
The price dropped 40 dollars instantly after this article came out. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:03:08
Right, and how come i don't see any of the idiots from the Ulbricht topic coming here to say hold on guys, innocent until proven guilty? They were all over the place in the other topic. It was so important to them. Why aren't they here to say the same thing? I know why. Because they are fucking hypocrites. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 10:34:58
Yeah, that poor guy. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 03:10:57
Cool man. Only been posted 30 times before. Just like basically everything else here. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:44:10
It's all good because they used Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 10:56:41
Yes, people came there to buy books. 
Stop it man, just stop it. This topic gets more crazy with every post you delusional idiots make. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:31:33
It was. Stop lying. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:38:49
What the hell are you talking about?
Get help man. The drugs made you completely paranoid. You can't be much older than 16 and you're already a full blown conspiracy theorist. You have one shitty life ahead of you man. Better get help now when you still can do something about. 
Shills, fbi bots, shutting down stuff...you are completely fucking delusional and paranoid. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:50:04
You are 100% right...and of course downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:42:55
Why are people who end their posts with lines like "wake up" and "open your eyes" always such incredible fucking morons?
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:23:37
If some guy raped your sister of mother are you gonna be like this as well? Are you gonna defend that guy like you are doing now because "innocent till proven guilty"? Are you gonna give anyone who talks bad about him shit? Tell them to fuck off?
If not then please explain why not. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:13:52
Take your meds. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:04:45
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:26:28
Unreadable. 
Major anouncement? In your own world maybe. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:29:17
You're not gonna believe this but it's already been posted. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:26:06
No they weren't. Stop lying. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:34:51
Ah yes, good reason not to check for duplicates before posting. Keep up the good work. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:00:10
If anything i learned from the internet it is to ignore people with the word truth in their username. They are usually very young and full of shit. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:31:13
Would you defend a random banker or rapist like this as well?
No, you wouldn't because you are a fucking hypocrite punk. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:17:25
But he used Bitcoin so it's all good. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:47:32
Would you say this as well about the guy in jail who raped your sister? Would you defend him until he is proven guilty? If not then why not?
@_date: 2014-04-22 10:51:55
ALLEGED fraudulent piece of crap. Innocent till proven guilty. Remember?
Funny that you came here to prove my point and are too retarded to even realize it. 
And LE fucked him over. Hilarious. So that's what it's called when they arrest an alledged drug dealer, money launderer and wannabe murderer. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:32:22
Horrible advice. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 17:15:26
Can you people please stop reposting everything 70 times?
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:54:52
Exactly. One person here just pulls out of his ass that the murder charges were dropped and all the lemmings repeat it as if it's a fact. Pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 04:22:39
This is ridiculous.  
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:39:22
Crazy. Next thing you're telling me they also use dollars and euros. I'll wait for the media to report about that though. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 02:06:43
Exactly, lets keep the poor scammer out of this. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:00:48
Because they are pathetic. You must have such an extremely shitty life if you either care about getting downvotes or if you downvote other people. It's beyond sad. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:48:55
You're. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:06:12
Just do it or he will downvote you. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:24:32
This has to be the most retarded topic i read in a very long time. I actually feel abused. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:12:48
"Abstraction". I just threw up in my mouth a little. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:09:33
Please stop posting the same thing every 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:54:45
Stop lying. 
Absolutely amazing the responses here. I never seen anything like this. A huge fucking criminal gets defended as if it's the end of the world. Everything points against him in this case but the delusional Bitcoiners don't care. 
He used Bitcoin so no matter how much wrong he did it's all forgiven. Not only that he should be free to go. 
Nowhere ever in another topic have i seen people worrying about the alledged and not guilty until proven part. 
Any other criminal and nobody would give a shit about that part...or about that criminal. But now it was a Bitcoin user and suddenly everyone is crying how he doesn't have to be guilty. And that we shouldn't judge him yet and other p.c. bullshit. 
Man, Bitcoiners are sad. Very, very sad. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:07:15
You are 16 right?
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:17:40
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:12:48
Ah right. So he nevered ordered them and it's all fud. And the case against him is all just fud. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:15:23
Oh the good old "open your mind". What else to expect in threads like this. 
So it's up to every person himself to define what a crime is right?
If i steal your tv i'm just gonna say crime is an abstraction and open your mind. Or does that suddenly don't work then? 
A bunch of drug users defending a drug dealer because he sold their product and used Bitcoin. 
Sad. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:38:18
Please tell me you are 15 or so. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:40:21
Fucking retard. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:18:44
He ran the biggest drugs trading site ever while taking a cut of every sale, you goddamn fucking idiot!
You people are completely fucking delusional!
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:38:56
No, they weren't dropped. One person made that up and now this topic is full if retards saying the same thing as if it's a fact. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:42:25
This is so fucking ridiculous i'm not even going to answer it. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:17:15
You morons are tipping 0,05 cents? What the hell? Why is this bullshit even allowed here?
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:19:37
Sure, i bet they will be here in full force in a few hours from now. 
Wait, actually no. I think they don't give a shit. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:04:23
And i think you're a fucking delusional idiot. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 09:33:55
I think someone who can't write 2 words without grammar errors has other things to worry about. I think the average 8 years old writes better than you. How old are you? Doesn't stuff like that worry you?
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:50:45
Who cares that he tried to have several people killed right? He was a nice guy so we should forgive him. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 09:22:26
Oh that poor poor drug dealer and money launderer. Better send him some money quickly. 
Please also to all the other drug dealers who need defense. 
Ooooooh wait, you don't give a shit if they rot in jail, they didn't use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:36:28
No they didn't drop them you fucking idiot!
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:27:27
It's hypocrisy in it's purest form. Alleged criminals are either innocent until proven guilty or they aren't. It's not something that changes depending on how people feel about a certain case. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 11:35:08
Only Bitcoin circle jerks allowed here!
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:48:32
Stop lying. It's disgusting. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:49:04
Get help. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 10:39:02
!!!!! Breaking news!!!! Wow!
Idiot.
