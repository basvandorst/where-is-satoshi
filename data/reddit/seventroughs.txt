My take on this clause is that the guidance suggests ‘final’ IRS regulations may require you re-characterize the 2013 basis.

IDK about Canada. 
NOT TAX ADVICE
In the US (for US subjects) the trending thought is BTC is taxable as a capital asset upon sale (cash out). 
The taxable amount (capital gain) is sale price minus basis. 
The taxable rate varies depending upon short or long term status, but is increasing for many Americans in three days.
Haven’t cleared with CPA, but likely listed on 8949 as ’10 BTC’, category C (not previously reported to IRS from a broker via 1099b or equiv.) and then reported on forms 1040/Schedule D.

The cap gains rate is, in fact, increasing.
I presented both the news, and a timely strategy to mitigate the damage.
Your welcome to ask follow ups if the strategy is unclear.

There IS an Effective Tax Increase on BTC positions established before 2014.
IRS tax treatment of BTC WILL change for any position started after the new year. 
Your way is ONE way to treat the basis. I provided another.
Sure, I was trying to provide a simple explanation for those that may not be well steeped in US tax law, tax mitigation or harvesting strategies.
Can appreciate you focus on the details, but no sense wandering into the weeds without a compass. 
Here is the VERY RECENT (info is not a year late, only two weeks old at this point) IRS Guidance from Dec 16th.
22. The proposed regulations that were published on Dec. 5, 2012, are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2013, but the Net Investment Income Tax went into effect on Jan. 1, 2013. May I rely on those proposed regulations, the proposed regulations published on Dec. 2, 2013, and/or the final regulations, also published on Dec. 2, 2013, for guidance on the Net Investment Income Tax during 2013?
(ANSWER) *Yes. For taxable years beginning before Jan. 1, 2014 (e.g., calendar year 2013), taxpayers may rely on the 2012 proposed regulations (published on Dec. 5, 2012), the 2013 proposed regulations (published on Dec. 2, 2013), or the 2013 final regulations (published on Dec. 2, 2013) for purposes of completing Form 8960. However, to the extent that taxpayers take a position in a taxable year beginning before Jan. 1, 2014 that is inconsistent with the final regulations, and such position affects the treatment of one or more items in a taxable year beginning after Dec. 31, 2013, then such taxpayer must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that their Net Investment Income Tax liability in the taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2013 is not inappropriately distorted. For example, reasonable adjustments may be required to ensure that no item of income or deduction is taken into account in computing net investment income more than once, and that carryforwards, basis adjustments and other similar items are adjusted appropriately.*
FROM 
**THUS**: Payment is due on ‘basis adjustment’ for ANY positions taken in ANY year ending before the next 48 hours. That is the bottom line, the last sentence of the IRS Decision Rule posted.
Cleary your strategy is one option, but another is as laid out. One DOES NOT need to add 3.8% (glad you did, but as another poster established - not everyone wants to donate that 3.8%).  
The strategy I laid out is about re-establishing basis in the next two days.  The IRS has consistently been made to accept "contemporaneous notes" to establish basis cost for ‘capital appreciation’. 
Appreciate you shared your strategy, would even appreciate it more when you provide an appropriate IRS decision rule MORE RECENT than December 13th along with your statements of fact.

Indeed, it has worked pretty well so far, which is why I shared the strategy.  Both parties benefit from the sheltering transactoin.

Nobody was posting about shelters or offsets when BTC was trading in the teens, nor througout the summer.  
Actually, December has always been the most common month for tax sale harvesting, causing what has come to be known as the January Effect.  
48 hours is plenty of time. 
Heck, most folks aren't thinking about this at all. The most upvoted post in the thread is for the guy that doesn't even know the cap gains tax is increasing and thinks I'm the one giving bad advice, lol.
