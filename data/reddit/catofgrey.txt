The scariest thing about Bitcoin isn't the drop from nearly $20,000 to nearly $10,000.
The scariest thing is that transactions costs are $10-40.  That's a real worry that Bitcoin isn't ready for its place as a real currency.

This is a legitimate issue.
On one hand, I have a small amount in bitcoin, and I was hoping that cryptos in general would be a place I could start using to build up an alternative savings account.
But there are so many edges to the Bitcoin Sword at the moment.
1.  The price swing up, then down, both carry a message:  this is not a consistent store of value right now.  A unit of exchange shouldn't be spiking, let alone crashing.  
2.  With the price swinging up, lots of people who wouldn't be interested become interested.  That creates large numbers of *unexpected* transactions.  
3.  As a result, the *transactions fees* of Bitcoin have been the main thing that is 'to the moon'.  My intent to put $100 - $500 per month in Bitcoin has been put off indefinitely:  I will be buying silver or gold coins for the moment.  I can afford a 5% commission on a 1/10th of an ounce of gold, that's under $10.  $30 fees for the same Bitcoin purchase, well, not right now.
4.  This has all left me with the feeling that this is a 'not ready for prime time' application.  We can't tell whether this is a modern application, or the story is going to end more like AOL, which was an amazing product that changed the world for hundreds of millions, but will only be known as a trailblazer and a 'beta test' rather than a final, lasting product.

It's not an investment.  It's a commodity, an exchange medium, and was never meant to be an investment.  If Bitcoin does what Bitcoin is supposed to do, the "price of a Bitcoin" will stabilize.
You don't want a situation where a Bitcoin buys 300 loaves of bread now, and then 120 loaves a month from now.  You want that Bitcoin to pay for pretty much the same amount of bread every day, month, and year to year.  And that's great for an exchange medium, or a type of money, but it's not an investment.
I suppose that it might be a hedge against another currency, like using gold to protect against a falling Dollar or Euro, but it shouldn't really appreciate in value much, and unlike company stock or debt, it doesn't earn interest, produce anything else of value, or pay any dividends.
So would it be a good idea to buy some Bitcoin right now?  Sure it would - if you were going to Russia, you'd get some rubles.  Bitcoin is useful everywhere...just not as an investment.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:53:32
Not necessarily.  I could see 80% of the transactions being made during a few "rush hour" periods.  If you do a lot of independent work at a Starbucks next to a BTM, this could be very feasible.

Let me confirm this, because from a US perspective, this sounds misinformed or deceptive.  Again, I'm not accusing, I'm asking a question as to how this is possible in the UK, because it's most definitely not in the United States.
Today's trading has the price of Gold at approximately 1000 GBP/oz.  I buy 1 ounce (1000 GBP) worth of gold coins.  Some time from now, the market price has risen, and I sell those coins for 1300 GBP.  
There is no capital gains on the 300 GBP gain?  Is it taxed as regular income?  How is it taxed, if it's taxed at all?
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:50:06
Correct.  The value of a bitcoin comes from the effort required to 'mine' it originally.  From there, it has worth depending on what it can be exchanged for.
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:08:20


Based on how many years of evidence?  Eight?  That's not close to the definition.  Lost 75% of it's value as recently as two years ago?  That's worse than all but a few world currencies.
The lack of an intrinsic value makes the case even worse.  Gold has industrial use, and is valued as a metal for aesthetic reasons.
This doesn't mean that Bitcoin isn't a good idea.  It's just that the evidence to claim it's a store of value isn't there yet.  It's likely to happen over the next 15-20 years, if not Bitcoin, then some crypto successor.  But it isn't there right now.
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:59:16
Any asset that loses 75% of it's value through trading, like Bitcoin did a year or two ago, doesn't meet the economic definition of a 'store of value'.
The design of Bitcoin is that, someday, it will likely be a store of value, but at the moment, it is still highly speculative as to it's long-term place in world finance.  But it isn't that way right now.
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:50:40
I look at the total value of all the gold mined in the world (about $7.5T) as an estimate for the total value of all Bitcoin in the future.
Right now, if the total value of 21 million bitcoin was equal to $7.5 trillion that puts a Bitcoin price at somewhere in the order of $300,000 - $500,000 per bitcoin.  
So that would put a Satoshi at about a half-cent.  That's my 'goal' for the value of a Satoshi.  It's the 'crypto penny'.

You got ripped off.  View from my desk, transaction costs on gold should be in the order of 1%, less in large amounts.


Weird.  You could have invested in other ways.  The last time I checked on this was 20 years ago, but I could just go buy gold coin, or a dozen.  Much more fungible.


In other words, you overpaid for your gold.  


Incorrect.  You just got ripped off.  This happens with BitCoin, where you don't realize you are getting ripped off by whatever seller or wallet you are using.  You need to find better alternatives, and use them.


Both objects are only worth what others will pay for.  Gold has over a 4000 year record of being a store of value.  Bitcoin has amazing technology, but has not complete a decade of being a reasonable store of value.  Your theory neglects common sense.  In addition, gold has industrial use as a physical object, and therefore a theoretical lower bound to its value.  Bitcoin doesn't have such a lower bound, it could theoretically drop to zero, just as MySpace and America OnLine went from valuable to value-less.
I'm bullish on bitcoin.  I think it is, at worst, the first example of an incredible transformation in currency.  It's not stable enough for 'prime time' yet, but it has a good possibility of becoming that.  But your criticism of gold is only a straw man based on bad decision making, and does not reflect how gold should actually be traded.

His reasoning on bitcoin may or may not be correct, but his reasoning on this specific topic is dead-on.
There are professionals, experts in both sports and statistical analysis, who are long-term profitable at sports wagering.  The biggest limitation that I see is that it would be difficult to scale a hedge fund past a certain point, at which it would be better if they simply bought a sports book operation.

Texas sharpshooter fallacy.
So gold is a thousands-of-years-old concept.  Literally zero risk of loss of value.
Bitcoin?  Substantially higher risk.  It's story is amazing so far, but this is like comparing Walmart stock with some random penny-stock, out of thousands of penny stocks, that happened to survive and become a large company.

Are you willing to permanently fix the price of Bitcoin at, say, $7500 / Bitcoin?
The issue is that the value of the crypto changes with respect to the value of a dollar.  At this time, it is treated similar to foreign currency, where realized gains are taxable as income.  If you want no taxes, the trade-off is that you are unable to make income from hodling.
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:55:49
What is the tax treatment difference?
Both have taxes paid on any gains.  If you sell foreign currency for $1000 more than you paid for it, or if you sell bitcoin for $1000 more than you paid for it, how is the tax treatment different?
@_date: 2019-10-31 21:09:03


No, but if the CNY changed in value, you would be expected to track that gain.  Also, your are forgetting that the daily value of what you are buying, when you are buying it in China, is also changing, exactly the same as the CNY.  So even if the CNY goes from $0.15 to $0.20, it doesn't matter, because that Y1000 purchase went from $150 to $200.  


Only if your currency doesn't change value.  I think you are mistaken on this point.


Yeah, that's because bitcoin is freakin' volatile.  The value of daily coffee isn't really going to change in a nation's currency.

Well, in theory it's supported by the production of the nations that have that currency.
The problem is that instead of being valued purely by a market, it's constantly manipulated for artificial stability by human beings, who are notorious for screwing around with things, not making correct-but-difficult decisions in order to be politically strong.  
And bitcoin has some intrinsic value:  the electricity and the computing power used to create the coin.  Like gold is a special metal, a bitcoin is a 'highly collectible and rare number'.

The total amount of all the mined gold in the world is in the order of $5 - $10 trillion.

Not the commenter, but my thought is no.  
However, I think people have more opportunities to develop savings than they think they do.  I don't think that the commenters goal of a 50% savings rate is reasonable for everyone. 
That said, there are some behaviors that definitely cause people to fall into poverty.  Having a baby out of wedlock set my mother back about five years, and arguably her entire life.  Not graduating from high school is a big predictor, too.  However, you can also argue that those, too, aren't really choices, but that goes further than the scope of this post.

Try again, please.  Something that doesn't have any expiration, and isn't consumed.  Like Gold, cash, or Bitcoin, which are three things that are traded, not consumed.  If I buy a ticket/flight, I cannot trade it to someone else after using it.  So I'm confused by your philosophy here.




I'm having trouble reconciling these two statements.  Help me out here.
And your thoughts regarding my primary issue would be nice, too.  What would be a reasonable valuation for the Cryptocurrency market (or Bitcoin) *compared to that of gold?*  Because I'm aware that bitcoin and gold are different.  However, they have similarities, namely as a store of value and a financial commodity.  And considering that a hard drive full of bitcoin doesn't have the same utility (I can't melt bitcoin into jewelry, or squish it into thin sheets that protect things from radiation), I would like a challenge that any valuation of crypto over gold isn't erroneous.  I ask, because I don't know.
Context:  I work with grey-bearded economists who believe that bitcoin is pretty much fictitious, more so than tulips and Beanie Babies.  I've also heard that the only use for Bitcoin is criminal activity.  I understand the arguments, but I see a ton of value and demand for decentralized, nationless currency.  However, what is a reasonable value?  What are some things that are similar in value to Bitcoin?  That's what I'm trying to get across here.

Then why is there a market price for Bitcoin at all?  Cryptocurrencies come in units, thus the recent market price for Bitcoin.  When I buy 'bitcoins' from an exchange or ATM, I'm buying something of value, not a transaction system that transacts with things of value.

Worldwide market value of all the gold ever mined is somewhere around $7 trillion.  Worldwide market value of all cryptocurrencies was over $1 trillion at it's height, probably around 500 billion at this point.  So right now, the value of 'all the crypto' is somewhere near 1/10 the value of 'all the gold'.
Thought   Wow.  This is amazing.  Look back over the last few years.  What was nothing is now something.  This is amazing technology, and the value is definitely proven.
Given the market cap of Gold, what is an upside of the future market cap of 'all cryptocurrency', particularly those, like Bitcoin, which do not correspond to actual physical assets?  Could we expect the sum of all the crypto in the world to be half of all the gold in the world?  Twice the value of all the gold in the world?  What can we base these claims upon?  We're comparing a virtual asset with a physical one, which is hard to wrap one's head around.
Thought   Bitcoin might be trading pretty near its actual intrinsic value, and may rise or fall from where it is today, but should not be expected to 'continue to add zeros' as it has in the past.

Few if anyone predicted that social change, so, yep.  I mean, they probably missed plenty of smaller details.  But the largest social change in the 20th century was a complete whiff.

Comparing the amount of Fed "printing" with the market cap of Bitcoin shows how Bitcoin is extremely small compared to the financial system.
In addition, another issue is that this isn't a permanent addition to the money system, it is a temporary adjustment that is expected to be undone in a few days.
Concerns about the stability of the money systems are legitimate, but this issue, in itself, isn't really noteworthy compared to other adjustments, like the massive downward pressure on interest rates.

Try to open a business without being on the party's good side.
A competitor just bought the property next to yours, and is 'doing some construction' that just shut down your street.  Zoning boards?  Permits?  Loss of income?  All that comes down to 'who's on the party's good side'.
You're an exporter or importer, and your income is tied to the Yuan.  But the government keeps screwing with it.  In some cases, this will artificially make exports more expensive, putting exporters in a bind.  In some cases, this will make imports more expensive, putting the squeeze on anybody who sets up a wholesale or retail shop in China.

Without negating the value of Bitcoin, you have made the assumption that past growth is equal to future growth.
Bitcoin has changed from a non-concept in 2011, to a seriously discussed financial topic in 2018.  That kind of change has driven the existing growth rate so far.  That rate is a growth of about 63x (from 100 in July 2013 to 6300 today) over five years, or about 230% per year.
Even though I think that Bitcoin will still increase in legitimacy, usefulness, and 'power' as a currency, I don't think it's reasonable to assume that Bitcoin is going to enjoy the same *change in legitimacy* over the next five years.
Here's a different way to think about it:  the total value of all the gold ever mined is somewhere in the order of $5-$10 trillion.  If the value of all the Bitcoin (21M bitcoin to be mined, right) had the same market capitalization, that would be a price of a few hundred thousand per Bitcoin.  And I think that's a pretty steep valuation for a currency who is definitely part of the future, but still is less than ten years old at the moment.

TL:DR;  Yes.  
The game is Asteroids.  Of the main games that initiated the "Golden Age of Videogames", it was, in my opinion, the second major 'hit' of the era, after Space Invaders.  Pac-Man was a year or two away, I recall.  OP mentioned it, but I wouldn't have required that information.  As a kid, I could recognize that high score table miles away.
The game was noted for vector graphics, not raster graphics, which made for razor-sharp images.  There were three sizes of Asteroids:  it's been a long time, but I recall that the largest were 20 points, medium sized were 50, and small sized were 100 points each.  There were two flavors of intermittent "UFOs" or "Saucers" which shot at you.  I think those were 200 and 1000 points.  Note that all the high scores are divisible by ten.
Another interesting feature was that the game allowed you to fire multiple shots at the same time:  in most games of the period, you couldn't fire again until your existing shot was completed.  Asteroids allowed 4-5 distinct shots at a time.
The game started with two large asteroids, each of which would break into two mediums when shot, and each medium broke into two small ones.  Since smalls are fastest, best strategy was to avoid breaking too many asteroids at once:  clean up little things first.  When one wave was clear, the following wave began, with more large asteroids.  I think the game topped out at 8, maybe 16 large asteroids:  remember that in 1980-81 there wasn't much memory or CPU power to track large numbers of objects (sprites) in real time.  So the potential of 8 large asteroids turning into 32 small ones, and a player, and a few shots.
As I mentioned, the game was the second massively popular game of the era, I'd be shocked if there weren't somewhere in the order of several hundred thousand machines manufactured.  There were millions of players.  Players learned that they could reach an adequately high level, thin the asteroids down to a single rock, then wait.  They could score points from the UFOs (often exploiting patterns and knowledge of where they would likely appear) and play *for hours* with little risk.  
An extra ship was earned every 10,000 points, so reaching that goal was the basic "beginner" achievement.  A solid player would likely score 40,000 points or more, which meant reaching the maximum difficulty level the game was capable of.  Mastery wasn't measured in points, it was measured in time.  A top player would 'turn over' the machine (scores were only tracked to 99,990, with additional scores resetting the display back to zero) many times, playing for an hour or more on a single quarter.

Crap, I didn't even think about using Wikipedia.  Dead honest here.  I was a nerdy kid in the 1970's and early 1980's.  You know how there are people today that have all the hundreds of Pokemon memorized?  Well, the nuances of Asteroids was my version of that.  
Another thought:  I realized I recognized that high score table quickly because of one other quirk:  the other principle games that used vector graphics, five digit scores, with three-letter names all had material differences:  Lunar lander was less popular, white-only lettering, but had 4-digit scores, I recall.  Two other games:  highly popular Tempest, and quirky Gravitar, both has *color* vector graphics, not strictly black-and-white.  Also worth mentioning was first-person tank shooter *Battlezone*, which was black and white, but filtered through a green filter, and would have been difficult to photograph due to the cabinet design, which required looking through 'goggles' to see the screen.

Your edit is correct.
Also, be careful what you wish for.  Most currency exchanges have spreads which give them crazy profit margins (10% or more).  Most users wouldn't accept that kind of margin to exchange bitcoins, I don't think.
