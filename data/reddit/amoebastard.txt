Your cheerleading makes no sense. Rain bitcoins? How is this going to make you get any Bitcoin back? It's like you've lost all contact with reality...

While we are at it, where is the evidence of him stealing coins?

We've got one! Quick, somebody pass me the dart gun!

So you could weigh your brute force attack more towards certain letters. You'd still have to explore the whole character space. It's a negligible impact in my opinion. Interested in the typing habit identification, do you have a link or more information to share?

God forbid they try to make a living...

Sounds like the start of a dystopian novel.

That's a great idea. I guess it's up to the vendor and the state laws.

There's no controversy at all - it's Berlusconi's propaganda paper, plain and simple.

I think you are getting confused between your libertarian wet dream fantasies and reality.

What in god's name makes you think that Bitcoin would go 89X this year? Do you even understand what an order of magnitude is?

because if you run this through the blockchain you are sure of contacting the other person. what are people supposed to do? post on reddit hoping that it will reach the intended recipient? write a message in a bottle and throw it into the ocean?

Damn, that's some solid proof there. Kind of like how it's always worked during an investigation?
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:48:06
Lol, imagine the drama.  again

You need a combination of both libertarian free market dynamics and unalienable enforced human rights for everybody. You need funds for justice. Hence, taxation and law enforcement. You can't have corporations just compete to enforce your safety, it would create a gang war type of situation. Have you seen what kind of job the free market is doing to public health in the USA? The public good, dear twat. Hobbes. Keynes.

Can't hurt to throw a BTC their way.

SO BRAVE. Unfortunately, your smug, patronising attitude does not change the fact that computer security is hard and inadequate for general mass consumer use of Bitcoin. Do you have any more snarky comments to make?

So, you wonder why he is not in jail, then wonder about proof? If there is no proof, doesn't that mean he should not go to jail then?

Put down the cocaine.

You are delusional. There is no way Karpeles stole the coins. Get real.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:52:16
Totally not scalable if every person using BTC has to open a channel
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:06:33
Because all good things come to and end
