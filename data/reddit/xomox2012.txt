If you are trying to hedge against the reserve btc is a decent option but so is stocks. If the USD fails enough business will cease using it and switch to something else. The stock is worth the company’s production and assets which is more than the residual value of bitcoin actually is.

Yea, I wanted to cash out some to get be back to a level I could afford to lose as I’m significantly over invested at the moment and I’m unable to sell. Should have chosen a different exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:04:58
I’ve cashed a few times from Coinbase. They always send me my money. It does take a few days though. Check the line in your “wallet” and you should see a deposit date (usually a week later).

Yea I’m aware of verge, it’s disgusting. I haven’t heard of substratum. Maybe they are getting paid like you mentioned. Makes sense I guess with bitconnect on there.
Honestly I just want ethereum and litecoin to get their market share back from the rest of the shit out there. 
Great read on verge though.
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:21:38
This really is the best response. You can use weighted average if you file as a business but you must have documentation as to why that method makes more sense financially than using FIFO or LIFO. You aren’t really paying more taxes using fifo but you will pay more of your total tax now versus your future sales.

I also recommend trying to play by the rules but their resources are definitely not unlimited. Your statement is not true. I work in accounting and have assisted multiple people and companies with taxes on a non-assurance basis. 
Those of my coworkers that work exclusively in tax and provide those services let me know that for every 100 filings that are flagged for audit, only 2 of them are actually followed up on. They refer to tax audits as the lottery you don’t want to win.
Basically even if your reporting should be audited there is only a 2% chance you will get audited. That said, it isn’t fair odds. The IRS spends its resources on cases they deem will be the most efficient which means high $ cases and cases they think will get payments quickly.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:10:21
This guy was great. I wish more people would follow his advice. One thing I’m surprised about is that he doesn’t call out verge as being a scam. I’ve heard nothing but sketch regarding that coin.
Subtratum on the other hand I’ve heard nothing about. Any info on that one?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:47:54
The gap between exchanges is constantly swinging as the arbitrage game is played heavily by market bots. Fees to move btc from one exchange to another is not feasible.
Buying and holding btc in both exchanges is really just the same as holding it in the one exchange and trying to time the marke. to actually get the gain associated with arbitrage you have to move between the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:43:07
Are you new to crypto?
You won’t get your crypto until about a week after your purchase. It takes awhile for the transactions to occur
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:45:24
Man, this company looks sketchy to me
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:28:39
Yea great info. Crypto does not qualify for like kind exchange. For those that don’t know what that means. Like kind exchange is basically where  you would trade one capital asset (something valuable to business that you own) for another to continue using for business purposes. Like kind exchanges often take place during mergers and acquisitions and provide a bit of a tax relief for those companies so they don’t have to pay taxes on money they pay their newly acquired parent/subsidiary. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:25:21
Definitely not a low risk idea. As a gambler sure go for it. Maybe your gains will make up for the irs penalty. 
Personally I think it is a really stupid idea though. Your 401k is likely your only source of retirement funds. Typical investor behavior would treat stuff like that with higher risk but that typically just means stocks which are still significantly less risky than bitcoin.
I’d say instead of cashing out, quit contributing over your employers max contribution and put that into crypto instead.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:01:54
Hmm BTC, ETH, LTC, Monero, and maybe ADA but I haven’t played in that one
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:21:48
Was new to me. Thanks for the repost
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:13:11
Yeah sounds impulsive all right. As someone else that struggles with similar tendencies I’ve gotta say, figure out a way to resist. You are older than I and likely wiser but your retirement is not something to gamble with.
All over this sub you can find the phrase “only invest what you can lose”. At no point is your retirement something really anyone can afford to lose.
Even 10% of your fund traditionally invested over the next 30 years will earn an almost guaranteed 7% compounding.
Seriously think twice...
Edit: try not to think of your house as part of your investment portfolio too. I get you could sell and downsize but is that really what you plan to do?
If you insist though, a balanced portfolio is what you should shoot for. Since you are already “balanced”  I’d stay stay where you are.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:38:51
Still can’t get verified, been trying for about a month now...

So what you are saying is the your password is in your clipboard and could be figured out via comparison to your txt file
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:17:50
Yea, I figured but it does seem to be picking up
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:51:15
As march noted, there is a point of mitigation but that actually defeats the purpose of arbitrage to begin with. You aren’t really buying from a and selling from b. 
Your closest scenario right now would be to have coin on both exchanges and when there is a gap sell coin on highest exchange, buy that same amount of coin on cheap exchange and then try to initiate a low fee transfer of that coin back to high exchange. In this way you mitigate the delay risk but there is still no way to beat the transfer fees.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:53:33
You are lucky that’s how... I’ve uploaded my stuff like 15 times at this point 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:06:31
You definitely can and people do. This question seems to be posted every other day or so. Use the search function.
Basically the transaction **and** delay eats up the difference pretty quick.
Edit: a word
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:13:05
If I were you I would hold out until next July before selling anything and just pay the short term gain you would legally owe.
I would be surprised if 1099-b would be pushed out next year for US exchanges if bitcoin stays where it is at currently. If it doubles up again however or starts hitting that magical 100k mark 1099-b is definitely going to be pushed out.
It comes down to what you think will happen. If you are trying to be shady and avoid paying legally owned taxes AND feel that bitcoin is going to double up again your idea of selling now and buying back in may be an idea to accomplish your goal of tax evasion. That said, as soon as you start running into that $10k cash bank deposit land you are going to get flagged by your bank and they will report the transaction. You would have to transfer it to another coin or asset. If you turn it to cash via Coinbase or local transactions and then deposited to a bank you are in trouble.
Honestly, is 15% worth committing a federal crime? I mean if you are only in for 3.5-7k in taxes it seems like a no brainer decision to me. Would you rob a bank or store for that kind of money?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:15:58
Pretty much. It is one of the only ways the government would be able to easily track down who is dealing in bitcoin. The user documentation will end up like that of a bank most likely. Regardless, exchanges are already using these types of documentation methods without the laws being in place yet.
I get your concern though but that is the price of anonymity. Your choice is to give up privacy for security or use a local exchange (person to person)
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:18:37
Because it is an incredibly risky investment with no fallback. It also follows all of the trends of a “bubble”.
That said, the technology backing it makes it so vastly different from any other tool I personally think the trends are coincidental. The smallish amount I have in it will ride or die as far as I’m concerned.
In the end it is all about being diversified. There will likely be a massive correction at some point and a lot of people will lose. Where that will occur, who knows... As long as all your investments are not tied to bitcoin you’ll be okay even if it does tank.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:48:53
Well there are technologies in development such as the lightning network that will drop the transaction fees back to where they are tolerable. Additionally, right now, you could be using a Segwit address which already would cut your costs significantly. 
It will get there if you are patient. I wouldn’t be keeping your life’s savings in btc though. That is just dumb from an investment perspective. You are breaking two huge rules. 1: invest what you can lose and 2: diversify.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:15:38
Damn I missed the bargain bin release. Guess I’ll pick through the leftovers

This is such a cool idea. I wish I had that kind of disposable money to make bitcoin geocaching a thing.
Enjoy your bitcoin wealth man and stay golden! Don’t let that big money lifestyle turn you.

Really auto mod? You are going to suppress a question how how to dump altcoins.
Great work, gents.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:50:20
If you invest in bitcoin and lose but make gains on your stocks there is no negation. You will have to pay the full gain tax on the stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:39:26
From the regular market yes. If you lose your shirt in stocks that loss will help negate the gain from bitcoin but the opposite is not true
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:28:03
Everyone’s life would be easier if it was a standard highway. Our toll roads have replaced our standard highways which pushes all that traffic into city streets while the toll roads are mostly empty. Sure, if you have that sort of disposable income it’s great as you don’t have to deal with the riff raft on the way in to work. The cost however is shittier traffic for the 90% of the population that can’t afford it or are smart/frugal. The end result is that traffic everywhere moves slower.
There are some areas of Texas where the only highway in or out of the area is tolled.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:14:56
Well it would be an additional 10 miles and anywhere from 1 hour and 15 minutes to 2 hours extra a day.
I consider my time worth more than $4-8 an hour so yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:33:17
To eliminate debt sure, people will sell. I’d “sell” it to buy things on the daily too if it didn’t cost so much in fees and was faster
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:56:14
Yeah that’s the plan. Still trying to figure out how to do it safely though. I’m not in a position to have this stolen so I’m trying to be incredibly careful.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:35:32
I see, so based on that, it is more of a privacy issue. I took it down. If my public key is something I want to keep private how do I pay with it too? For example there is a coffee shop near me that takes bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:40:14
With privacy you’ll have to try finding someone in person. The exchanges mostly require identification due to upcoming legislation. You’ll have your ID provided to them and you’ll take a photo.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:51:48
Yea, I mean, this is the equivalent of you handing someone $ and saying help me without any real contract or way to enforce anything. At least it was only .15 :(
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:16:42
So if I create a new wallet within Mycellium and transfer my balance from the first to the second and then import my private key from the first to a bch and bcg wallet respectively I could then sell the bcg and bch at an exchange? 
Wouldn’t both of my mycellium address have the same private key though?
Do you know a trusted wallet for each of those coins or an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:37:54
So the phrase is the same as the private key and the gibberish is my extended public key. To receive coin I need to provide my public key but not my extended public key
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:25:48
So when I transfer to my new wallet does it matter if I put in the public or private key?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:19:38
Well I’m lucky in that I don’t have much so I guess that saves on the time. Of course that also means I don’t have as much btc as I should have
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:27:30
What is the difference, like how do I find my private key if that is the public one? I know I need to store it in case my wallet is lost or something
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:23:48
Yeah, if you live out in the middle of nowhere you can get an inspection for about $30-$40 but if you are in the city, you can hit $60 easily. You also get charged again if you fail and don’t get it fixed within around 3 days.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:24:38
Have you been to Texas lately? They become privatized and you get raped by tolls that are not tax deductible.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:01:55
As it stands now, yes that is possible. The government doesn’t treat btc atm as currency so they would still be interested in the values at which you received the bitcoin at and what you paid for rent at. It is one of the big hurdles right now for cryptocurrencies becoming used for every day purposes. There are laws in the works that would allow $x worth of transactions per year to occur before they would care.
That said, ultimately if they are suspicious of you they are going to look at the way you are living and compare that to your income. Is it feasible for you to be driving a bmw and living in 3000 sqft flat in NY making 40k? Not really. Then they will wonder how you are funding yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:33:34
They wouldn’t know how much bitcoin you have and really wouldn’t care. It is basically impossible for them to prove you own an address. 
However they will know how much you get when you sell it unless you sell to someone paying cash and never deposit that cash. The IRS will most definitely have any deposit coming from an exchange flagged for review. You’ll likely have to prove your basis( how much you paid to get it) when you sell so gain can be calculated. In general Any time $10k or more is deposited (cash) in an account a form is immediately filed that basically marks you for suspicion. If you are suspected to own bitcoin and are investigated they will perform all sorts of lovely cash flow analysis that basically account for all your money and how you got it. If you can’t explain the money they assume it came from something illegal or you were hiding it.
One interesting note: in tax cases the burden of proof is on the taxpayer, not the irs. That basically means you are screwed without a solid CPA if you are ever brought to court for taxes.
Edited for clarification.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:53:14
Lol what a great response. Elon seems like the type of millionaire that would be cool to have a beer with.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:35
The IRS and governments in general like to have their cake and eat it to. No cake for you unless you line their pockets.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:55:14
Meaning reduce transaction cost by increasing transaction capability. That is Inherently a good thing. However the block size increase decentralized it thus going about it at the wrong way. Is that correct?  
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:45:23
Yea you’ll want a cpa for this one. Mined coins would technically be counted at the value you earned them but that isn’t going to make Uncle Sam much money so I’d expect you to get reamed if you tried that. Just be prepared to show that you own the address and that the coins you have were mined by that address. Then when you sell them, be prepared to show that as well.
Unfortunately you won’t get to treat this like an ira.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:41:37
Ok I think I need to speed more time figuring the difference between public and extended public

Makes sense, thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:47:23
May have to find a local cash buyer. You can usually charge a premium due to the anonymous factor you are providing. You will want to make these transactions from a private wallet though
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:36:54
It costs me $8 a day to get to and from work. If I don’t take the toll road it adds an additional 40 minutes each way.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:55:41
Transaction history can be scraped to show every address that a bitcoin has “belonged” to.
The burden of proof in tax cases lies with the taxpayer and not the court which basically means instead of them proving you guilty you are proving yourself innocent. Understand the transaction logs and you can do so.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:30:22
I think it will be a bad thing but I’m more of an accounting guy than finance guy. Volatility can cause people to lose a shit ton in futures and well, bitcoin is such. That said, I think it is a really cool hedge personally. The accounting will be nightmarish though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:11:54
Our lovely past governor, Rick Perry, basically made a deal with NTTA to let them build highways and charge a fee for it. I presume he got a kickback of some kind somehow.
We don’t have state income tax but we do have high property taxes and an 8.25% sales tax on everything but raw foods and medicine. We also have high vehicle registration and inspection costs and a gas tax (built in to the pump).
But yeah, it is spent on a lot of dumb things for sure.... Definitely not our education or infrastructure. Texas used to be a beacon of strong infrastructure but we are quickly being outpaced due to our government policies.

I would be more worried about encryption in general.  QC can just brute force everything in use currently
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:02:05
You have enough bitcoin to easily cover your initial investment. If you are stressing. Maybe sell .66 bitcoin to ensure you are not losing and a little extra and hold the rest. I honestly would have rebalanced by now and sold most of that to ensure I had a 50/50 balance between bitcoin/stocks/bonds/micro loans. Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket and you’ll be fine
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:16:31
Yeah I️ wouldn’t listen to this guy. Certainly put in some as it is a high risk high reward tool and much more so than stocks but the key to financial success is a diversified portfolio.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket as they say.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:02:30
Honestly, that amount of money is so much more than I️ can actually imagine, I’d leave $100k in bitcoin for my family in a will and sell the rest. From there I’d pay off my debts and then diversify into various etfs/mutual funds. I️ think I’d be set for the rest of my life off dividends and actually retire one day. Beats working till I️ die.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:19:03
Yeah I only divested half of my portfolio. Lite coin is what is really killing me. I’m down like 60%
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:33:12
Sell off $100 and forget about the rest again. From then on you'll have made an $85 profit over two years, amazing roi, and may end up making a lot more if this does hit 10k or higher. If the money crashes then you are out only the house cash.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:20:54
Serious question. How are you guys buying bitcoin at low fees? Coinbase is like 3% and I'm not seeing where else to buy. I'm seeing references to things but I'm quite new to this fraud.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:24:37
I suppose I am not familiar with what you mean by transaction. Is transaction the act of mining and receiving a bitcoin from this "system"
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:18:45
Gotcha it is more on the spending side. Like a sales tax.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:00:35
Yay I did the same stupid thing
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:43:32
If people are interested in buying it at a premium sure, that’s totally doable
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:12:02
Yea... I lost though. I bought at like 15k for a portion of what I sold
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:27:32
Eh, I'd say a 50% guaranteed match is worth it. I'd contribute to their limit and bitcoin the rest up to 15% of your total monthly.
