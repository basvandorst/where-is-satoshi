The right solution to this problem is allowing RBF only if the new transaction still spends to the same outputs. This is known as "honest" or "first seen safe" replace by fee.

We're currently experiencing an outage of our USD matching engine (for Coinbase Exchange only). We have identified the issue and working on a fix ASAP.
Deposit/withdrawal are unaffected, and trading of other currencies is also not affected.
See: 
Edit: USD exchange is fully operational again.
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:24:35
Fixed now. Sorry for the trouble!
Let me know if you're still having any issues sending.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:54:41
I see your point. However, this isn't a side fake ID business we're talking about, it's a large professional vendor. Unfortunately it's not worth risking our company on the tiny chance that this one transaction out of hundreds was the only legitimate one. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:36:40
We recently made some changes to our limits &amp; verifications. Previously, you may have heard about Coinbase canceling purchases because they were "high risk".
Now, we will never cancel your purchase, but your account may start out with a lower limit. After you have completed some purchases successfully, the limit will increase over time. This is to protect against Coinbase being used to buy bitcoin using stolen bank account credentials (once you have made a few successful purchases then there is much less risk of the bank transfer being reversed).
You can always view your current limit (and steps to increase it) here:
@_date: 2015-06-08 04:10:00
Thanks for the kind words :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:23:25
I don't think it's against our ToS, but we rate limit how many free transactions you get per day. Otherwise you could troll us just sending free transactions back and forwards all day.
@_date: 2015-06-07 23:14:42
Taking a look into this...
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:22:01
Thanks! We updated that page.
We're also starting to see some transactions take a while to confirm, so we're going to double our transaction fees until the stress test is over.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:27:51
Come on. We are not investigating transactions really far away from the source. You sent bitcoin directly to an address known to be selling fake IDs. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 01:55:03
Not sure that bitcoin is the best solution if you want to control your kids' spending, but fwiw we do already allow teens to set up an account, as long as they have approval from a parent or guardian.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:05:26
I don't get it. Your headline is the exact opposite of what I said.
@_date: 2015-06-08 04:04:28
It's not set in stone. But if you buy $50 worth and wait a couple weeks, your limit should increase. If you don't get an increase within 30 days, feel free to contact support and they should be able to help you out.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:31:23
I'll comment. If you use Coinbase to conduct illegal activity, we are required by law to close your account. If you are using Coinbase for legal things or buying bitcoin for personal use then you have nothing to worry about. It's pretty simple really.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:54:11
I agree with you, it's possible that someone may have their account shut down when they may not have made an illegal purchase, simply because they sent money to someone who was a known bad actor.
Ultimately though, this is not something we have control over. It's a fundamental requirement of AML laws (and our banking partnerships) that we detect and prevent illegal activity on our platform. It's not us going "above and beyond" as people have said, this is simply what is required of all financial institutions in most of the world.
So let me turn the question around: Can you see how a regulator or banking partner may find it easier to send us a large fine, or shut down Coinbase completely, rather than listen to a story about how we let illegal activity continue because hypothetically a known vendor may have been selling something legal on the side?
If that were to happen, it would affect all Coinbase customers. At the end of the day, we would rather stay in business and support our customers who are using bitcoin for unambiguously legal purposes, and we are not in a position to make an argument that there should be a higher standard of proof.
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:25:05
At risk of feeding the trolls..
The Coinbase checkout / donation buttons by default do not require any additional information. You can send directly to the bitcoin address we generate.
Any merchants or charities who require additional information from you is at their request.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:32:51
Sorry, I missed the part where following the law makes us obsolete.
How would you do it differently?
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:12:39


That will absolutely not happen. Simply using bitcoin to buy things is not illegal.
I can't say how exactly we detect which customers are using bitcoin for illegal purposes (that would be aiding money laundering), but I can say that there is a lot of FUD in this sub, and most cases where I see someone complain on here and then look into their account, it's pretty plainly obvious that they are engaged in illegal activity.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:28:48
You could visit  while signed out.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:09:04
If you use Coinbase Exchange, the spread is usually only a few cents. This will only work if you are in a supported state though. If you place a limit order which is not filled immediately (maker order), there is no fee.
Note that to buy that quantity of bitcoin, you will probably need to go through some extra due diligence process to get your account set up. You can do this on our website, or feel free to PM me and I will put you in touch with our VIP team.
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:15:10
Yes, I'm well aware of it (I read reddit most days). Donating to gwern alone is not against our ToS. Some users who donated to that particular address drew attention to the fact that they were also using Coinbase for other things which are against our ToS.
I apologize if my answers came off as evasive, I'm answering as best I can. It would definitely be easier to just ignore threads like this, but I respond because I care about our customers.
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:05:31
We have a couple of vault options available, so to clarify:
* The regular vault is still managed by Coinbase. We add a 48 hour withdraw time delay, and multiple notifications to your phone and email addresses (in case your account was compromised and someone tried to withdraw your bitcoin without your permission).
* The "multisig" vault has keys controlled by you. This means that if Coinbase was unavailable, you are still completely free to send the bitcoin to another address using our open source recovery tool: 
We don't have anything called a "cold storage vault", so just wanted to clear that up.
More info: 
Let me know if anything is unclear or if you have any questions!
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:19:05
I would personally love to do that, and it's something we have discussed internally (law permitting of course).
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:37:44
Sure. Let me speak generally.
We are required to monitor accounts for illegal activity and/or money laundering by law (see: Bank Secrecy Act). This is serious stuff - if we mess up, best case we get a massive fine (see: Ripple Labs $700k fine today), worst case we go to jail (see: Charlie Shrem). We absolutely do not support illegal activity on our platform, and if we believe you are engaged in this we will either send you an email asking for more information about your transactions, or close down your account (allowing you to withdraw remaining bitcoin).
For certain cases, we are also required to report them to FinCEN or law enforcement. I can't comment on the specifics of what we are required to report, or how often this happens. But for a single transaction under $100, there is almost zero chance it would meet these requirements.
Further reading: 
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:32:39
Which country are you in? We support most of Europe.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:48:10
When we close accounts, we almost always allow you to withdraw your bitcoin. The only time we freeze accounts is if we have a court order, or under a small subset of OFAC sanctions.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:31:39
How would you like us to respond? I don't know anything about this specific case, but we take customer privacy seriously and it seems extremely unlikely that this happened because of us.
If we believe a customer is engaged in illegal activity then the first thing we would do is close their account (and in this case OP says they have received no communication from Coinbase).
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:30:50
Correct. There are no fees on the exchange if your trade is not filled immediately. This method will take a bit longer though, so it's up to you with the time/cost tradeoff.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:45:45
No we can't. With the multisig vault, you control 2 of 3 keys, so we have no ability to lock you out.
OP - to answer your question about our vault recovery tool, this is a fairly standard piece of software, and you could also recover your vault by importing the keys into another wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:23:23
Sorry guys, we're looking into this. It appears to be an issue with our network provider (Cloudflare). We have an urgent ticket open with them and I'll update here with any details.
Edit: We're back up again.
@_date: 2015-07-11 05:10:42
I think it's just a UI bug, it should say $25
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:01:44
We never freeze accounts (unless required by court order). In the past we sometimes canceled orders if we thought there was a high chance of fraud, although this rarely happens now. You should have no problem buying large amounts of bitcoin, although your account will probably have a lower daily limit at first.
You can apply to raise your limits here: 
@_date: 2015-07-21 05:28:17
Unfortunately it's hard to predict when we will get a green light for each of the remaining states, but we're working on it :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:59:21
It's unlikely that it would get canceled if your account has successful transfers in the past, although it's pretty likely that if you bought that much BTC we would have to reach out to get additional KYC info. I would recommend applying for higher limits + wire transfer functionality in advance on this page (usually takes a few days to approve): 
Side note: If you do a wire transfer, the money usually comes through same or next day since there is no chargeback risk for us, which is much faster than waiting a week.
Also, if you are in a supported state I would recommend using Coinbase Exchange to purchase, because the fees are cheaper.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:36:41
We have reviewed their internal security architecture and are confident in their security. Cloudflare support several major banks, along with most bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2015-07-18 03:22:35
In general, you shouldn't buy Bitcoin on Coinbase and resell it commercially. This puts you in the realm of being a money transmitter, which is a regulated activity both federally and in most states (and not something we are allowed to support).
I also wouldn't personally recommend selling Bitcoin online to strangers, unless you are very aware of the chargeback/reversal risk of the payment method you are accepting. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:19:05
IANAL, but you still need to be registered with FinCEN and have an AML program which satisfies their requirements, regardless of whether your state regulates money transmitters (and if you are selling online then you need to take into account both your state, and the state of the recipient).
@_date: 2015-07-21 05:26:07
Sorry to hear that. If you're interested I'd be happy to take a look at your account and see if there's anything I can do here (just PM me your Coinbase account email). We love high volume traders (although we are required by law to check that you have a legitimate source of funds if you start buying many thousands of dollars worth of BTC, but this is usually a pretty painless process and we're working on automating most of it).
@_date: 2015-07-13 11:24:16
Sorry guys, working on this as we speak.
Updates here: 
Edit: All sorted.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:41:56
Accounts are safe, this has nothing to do with our internal infrastructure.

Not sure who is writing news articles for bitcoin.com, but just want to point out that the author was completely trolled by [this reddit comment]( which was not posted by anyone from Coinbase. No engineers consumed EtOH and tripped over any cables :)
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:45:29
Nope. One of our website hosting providers (Cloudflare) had an outage, so basically they were unable to forward requests to our web servers.
This affected many sites who also use Cloudflare (they power a pretty significant proportion of top websites). It had nothing to do with the bitcoin network, or the current blocks/transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-06 03:29:39
Selling bitcoin is usually 1-2 days, depends on your bank.
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:58:10
That is just a limit put in place for new users. If you make a purchase and wait some period of time (usually 1-2 weeks), your limit will increase.
You can see steps which will increase your limit here: 
As an aside, don't create more than one Coinbase user account. That looks like scammer behavior to our system and will result in lower limits.
@_date: 2015-07-21 05:23:44
That's strange. Our system usually only increases the limits (normally you start with a low limit and it increases over time). We should never give you a high limit and then decrease it. Can you PM me your Coinbase email or the reference of your buy so I can take a look?
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:34:42
Didn't see this. rydan didn't have any questions, he was just making a point.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:04:20
It's affecting all Cloudflare users. We don't think this is a deliberate attack.
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:43:46
I see. There might be something else going on, I don't claim to know much about the HN algorithms. I guarantee no one at Coinbase is responsible though - no one has mod access (only Brian has access to the job post submit thing, which is totally separate from moderation).
Definitely agree with you that vote manipulation hurts us all. I feel your pain, it happens to me a lot on here too. 
Btw, I'm a big fan of both BitcoinJS and Neocities, so thanks for your work on them!
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:37:14
We have a multisig vault, which offers the best of both worlds (2/3 keys required to sign, you hold 2, we hold the third). Just choose "manage security myself" when you set it up.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:21:50
Thanks for raising awareness of this.
As some people have noticed, this phishing attack was able to send from news correctly signed with DKIM. It looks like our account with an email provider (sendgrid) was compromised. As soon as we saw this email we removed the relevant entries from DNS, and are in communication with sendgrid to determine how this happened. As we were only using sendgrid as a backup email provider, this compromise didn't lead to any leak of Coinbase customer data.
Stay tuned for an update once we know more.
@_date: 2015-04-09 04:24:55
No, there was no compromise to Coinbase wallet safety or any customer data.
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:14:33
Out of interest, how would you expect the price to be quoted in bits? We've thought about this too, but there's no perfect solution. 
Edit: I mean how we would format the exchange rate in bits. For example:
- 1 bit = 0.00025 USD - this is not practical, and introduces the decimal places we're trying to avoid
- $1 USD = 4,005 bits - this is ok, but it introduces the slightly unintuitive property that the number going down means bitcoin is doing better
- 1,000 bits = $0.25 - this is probably the best I've seen
@_date: 2015-04-10 18:33:29
We weren't actually using the sendgrid account, it was configured as a backup. So there was no sensitive data or email content in there. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:09:39
It prevents fraud because we get a lot of scammers signing up using stolen bank accounts/identities and trying to buy bitcoin. Unfortunately it's sometimes hard to tell the difference between a scammer with a real bank account and a good person with a real bank account.
I understand this can be really painful, and we're working on a major upgrade to our fraud system which will stop these cancellations from happening in future. In the meantime, as mentioned, if you email support we can usually look at the account and allow your purchase to go through at the original price.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:23:34
Our USD wallet is only available in some states, but buy/sell is available to all US customers. Good point though, we should probably make this more clear.
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:33:17
To be clear, our email database was not compromised. Many people on this thread are reporting they received this email even when they do not have a Coinbase account, or received it through email addresses used for other bitcoin services. We believe this attacker was simply targeting email addresses known to be active in the bitcoin community.
We had sendgrid configured as a backup email provider, but were not actively using it to send emails. It was disabled as soon as we detected these emails being sent through it.
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:31:41
Let's see what we can do about that... paging @_date: 2015-04-10 00:30:31
To be clear, only a small fraction of the people who received this email actually had a Coinbase account. The spammer's list of email addresses did not come from Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:06:26
We didn't lose control of the signing key, someone accessed our email account and sent a bunch of emails. We have a list of every email that was sent.
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:42:02
I followed up with a PM. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:12:47
Well, for starters I think "forced on us as a default" is an oxymoron. 
But sure. Bits have been great - we've supported them for a while, and most of us use them internally. Many of our user surveys find new users telling us that Bitcoin is "too expensive", so we think this is a good step to remove that perception. Also bitpay have committed to switching to bits by default. So I think this is a no brainer. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:27:29
I don't have any theories about why your posts are falling faster than others on HN, but I highly doubt anyone from Coinbase is downvoting you (and afaik there is no way to downvote topics on HN anyway? I certainly don't have that option).
I wouldn't even say that article is critical of Coinbase, you were just stating the facts.
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:18:06
If you hold a fiat balance on Coinbase, there is no minimum fee when you buy Bitcoin. The 15c minimum only applies when you're buying directly from your bank account. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:25:50
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:40:05
Thanks! Your detailed analysis is correct. We believe someone compromised our sendgrid account. We were not actively using this account, but it was configured as a backup. It has since been disabled, and we are working with sendgrid to track down the source of this attack.
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:19:49
No. We only charge the card if your bank transfer fails for whatever reason. The most we may do is place a small temporary charge to make sure the credit card is valid. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:51:29
Very odd. It might be a bug in our iOS app, because it's definitely not pending in our system. I'll get our team to take a look at this - thanks for the screenshot.

If your UK bank allows SEPA deposit/withdrawal then it should work fine. I don't believe you need to wait for verification, you just need to confirm your identity then send the money to Coinbase.

Hah thanks. Will see what we can do!

Why should entire domains with good content get banned, just because certain accounts are posting their content a lot? By that logic, I could get any random domain banned just by setting up a bunch of bots to submit their articles.
Not commenting on the particular content of btcfeed.net, but the mod here suggested that he reviewed the actual site and it contained original content, so I don't see the problem.
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:17:14
Nothing that advanced. I just hang out on reddit a lot and recognize your name. That said, maybe it was a while ago I got that impression, so maybe my comment was unfounded. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:52:44
Sorry to hear about your loss. As others have mentioned, using our sandbox (or storing API secrets separate from source code) would be the best way to avoid this in future.
I wanted to just correct a few people here - there is no need to call your bank or start a chargeback/reversal process. This will cost you money, us money, and result in your coinbase account getting banned.
Much easier is to email support (as you mentioned you did already). If the buy was placed over the weekend, then we won't have even sent this to the bank yet, so there is still plenty of time for us to cancel the order.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:24:47
We don't use any software. I just have this page bookmarked, and read it most days:
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:56:05
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. The vault withdrawal delay of 48 hours starts when you've approved it from both emails. If you look at the transaction details screen you can see any remaining approvals (if these have not been completed).
If it has already been approved from both emails and is still not complete after 48 hours, then email support. I've never seen that happen though.
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:44:36
coinbase.com is in there too. Not that it would do anything to prevent a Mt. Gox style failure.
@_date: 2015-03-13 05:14:00
Well I know you're not our biggest fan :) But yeah, if you use your Coinbase account to do things which are illegal, we are required by law to close your account and let you withdraw your bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:16:04


Yes, because the alternative is people thinking we don't give a damn :)
I'm well aware of how fraudsters make their activity look legit, we have to deal with this all day long. Luckily, it is quite difficult for scammers to build up multiple purchases over a period of months without the real bank account holder noticing their money is missing. So in this case, we are willing to take the extra risk in order to provide a better overall customer experience.
@_date: 2015-03-20 16:09:52
If you don't have the funds available, the ACH debit from your bank will fail and we don't pay out the BTC. This is why it takes 4 days to buy bitcoin with ACH.
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:31:57
Adrian from Coinbase here.
We do not have a partnership with Purse.io, and this is misleading advertising using our brand. Purse is currently using our API, however there is no official partnership between Coinbase and Purse.
We have reached out to Purse and asked them to retract this statement.
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:36:52
Basically, we don't always do off Blockchain transactions for Coinbase to Coinbase transfers. If your balance is really low then we don't move your Bitcoin into our hot wallet, and this means we can't do off Blockchain transactions. 
This is something we're working to improve, but for now we can't always process payments that are below the minimum dust amount. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:59:14
Huh? You can send bitcoin from Coinbase to Bitfinex. There is no policy against it and your account can't get frozen.
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:54:42
I took a look at them and they appear to be confirmed (and have been confirmed for quite a while).
What is the exact issue you're seeing? Can you possibly send me a screenshot if you're seeing these transactions not confirmed somewhere?
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:52:25
Look, we hate having to apply blanket guilty-until-proven-innocent rules like this, but the reality is that when someone puts a comment like that in a transaction, for a believable amount of money, there is no way for us to know whether or not it was a joke. While marijuana may be legal in a few states, it is still federally illegal and also illegal in CA where we (and our bank) are located. Regulators who audit our AML processes will look for transactions such as this, and if we do not take action they will ask why we are allowing illegal activity on our website. This applies to any bank or MSB, it's not unique to bitcoin.
I believe it was mentioned in the email we sent you, but to make it clear:
- We never freeze your bitcoin in these cases, you are still free to withdraw it.
- If you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the transaction was not what it says it was, we will happily reactivate your account.
Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:40:19
Right, that is basically the difference. If you are using funds to run your own exchange service (e.g. trading on localbitcoins) then you are by definition (in US law) a money service business and need to be licensed as such. 
If you're simply sending your money to another exchange, then you're doing nothing wrong (in fact this is known as arbitrage and something we encourage).
I might add that none of this is something we do to discourage competition or prevent you from working with other companies - it's things that the US lawmakers and the banks we work with require.
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:49:03
You can't instant buy $10k. The most we allow is $1k instant buy (unless you deposit the $$ first). To get instant buy we require you to add a visa or mastercard credit card as a backup payment method for precisely the reason you described.

He won't have any problem buying that many euros worth of Bitcoin on Coinbase (assuming he is happy to scan passport or other ID). There is no chargeback risk for us in Europe so we never cancel orders or anything like that. CoinJar have similar verification procedures in Australia, although I'm not sure what their daily limits are. 
I'd be more concerned with Bitcoin price fluctuations. He should sign up and verify on both Coinbase and CoinJar, and make sure he is aware what the daily limit is on both. That way he can buy in EUR and instantly cash out in AUD while minimizing the amount of time he is holding BTC. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 03:23:32
Put it this way: If you have completely lost access to an email address, and it's clearly unavailable now, we will help you recover the bitcoin. This is not an uncommon scenario, and something we have to help users out with on a regular basis (which is part of the reason our vault is a great solution for 99% of people, especially those who don't trust themselves to not lose a private key). 
That said, we're not going to reset the account it until we're sure that it's really you, so we would need to verify this. We don't publish a definitive list of things you will need to give us to prove you are the rightful owner - this would only help hackers.

We're definitely trying our best to bring Coinbase to UK. If your bank supports SEPA transfers, you should be able to buy using Euros on Coinbase today - not ideal I know, but it's better than nothing.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:31:00
Email coinbase support, we can help you reset the lost phone number. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:33:16
Good to know. I have heard from some UK people that their bank didn't support SEPA payments, but maybe it's just not enabled for some people (and it sounds like it's quite expensive anyway).
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:09:38
We're working on it. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:12:41
If we can verify that you are the legitimate owner of the account some other way, then it will be fine.
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:23:57
Our Europe payments work differently - there is no need for credit cards because you send Euros directly from your bank account to your Coinbase wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:50:23
Will follow up in PM
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:43:19
We're working on it. Stolen credit cards are much easier for scammers to get a hold of than stolen bank accounts, so it's harder for us to do this without losing millions to fraud. But it's definitely something we want to support in future. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 00:28:48
If you have set (and remember) your backup password for Authy, you should be fine (they sync your 2 step verification codes across devices).
I would set up and test the new phone before throwing away the old one.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:59:39
Incorrect. Our bitcoin held online (in our hot wallet) is covered by insurance against theft, hacking etc.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:25:16
10 is enough :)
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:08:03
We're aware of this one, should have the website shut down shortly.
In future, feel free to forward these to support and we will follow up.
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:39:02
Cryptographically proven :)
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:33:32
I'm well aware of that, yes. 99% of our fraud comes from such stolen identities. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:51:10
There are multiple ways to take down a phishing site - alerting the DNS registrar is one, but we can also alert the ISP, and get it added to the Chrome/Firefox phishing site blacklists. We use all of these methods.
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:41:09
Totally agree, the current system is far from ideal. We've made a few improvements lately, for example now we do not cancel any orders if you have a good purchase history, even if our fraud algorithm things something is up (so your case should never happen again), and we very rarely cancel orders after 4 days now (it will almost always happens within a few hours).
However, the fact we have to cancel orders at all is really bad customer experience, so we're working on a completely different approach which will be much more transparent and do away with these cancellation emails entirely.
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:41:01
Correct. Although, if your email server doesn't verify DKIM signatures, then you probably have very little to no spam protection, and PGP is the least of your worries. Without DMARC, non-Coinbase emails should still be sent to spam for not being correctly signed, but with DMARC, they should be rejected outright.
Luckily, most email servers these days follow the standards.
@_date: 2015-03-13 02:20:38
Glad I could help!
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:12:52
Damn typos :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:32:17
In general, I agree with you. The reason we refunded this particular attack was because it was more than simple phishing - the hacker was (a) able to create an OAuth application which used the Coinbase name, which should not have happened, and (b) able to request a really high daily send limit, which we have decided to restrict for new applications.
I'll also add that we have seen very few successful phishing attacks in the past 6 months (I could count them on one hand), because of the security measures we have in place such as 2 factor authentication, and device verification. So we use both approaches - we train people to use the right security measures as much as possible, but compensate people where our security measures reasonably should have prevented their loss.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:37:49
We already cryptographically sign all Coinbase messages with DKIM, and protect against fraudulent use of our email domain using DMARC. So if an email comes from a  address and reaches your inbox, you can be sure that it has been signed by us.
Unfortunately, as this incident shows, people are unlikely to notice the lack of a digital signature (this email was sent from a .it domain).
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:22:52
It depends on the situation. On the whole, we pay bitcoin network fees for you. However, if you send a really small amount, or exceed our internal limits, you will be asked to include a fee.
There is also no fee if your transaction is sent off-blockchain. However, if you only have a small amount of bitcoin in your account to begin with, we may not process it off-blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:42:48
SPF may be easy to work around, but DKIM is not so easily overcome. It is simply not possible to spoof a  email address without our private key, and we use DMARC to enforce this policy. This means that our customers can be sure that if email is sent from a  email address, it's coming from us.
If you can find a way around this, let us know and we will award you minimum $1000.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:21:45
We already do this. The OAuth page that this application linked to explicitly stated that the app was requesting about a dozen permissions, including the ability to send a large daily limit from your account.
Unfortunately, warning users will only take us so far. I think in future we are going to have to explicitly review applications which require the ability to send any more than a trivial amount of money out of your account.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:45:53


You could set up a second bank account (e.g. savings account) so that the one you link with Coinbase (or any other exchange) doesn't have as much money in it.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:08:39
It's legitimate (and will not ask you for your Coinbase password). We're currently in the process of fixing the email address on these so that they are sent from a  address.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:49:56
Delighted is a legitimate company we use to send occasional satisfaction surveys to our customers (no more than once per year).
They in turn have a strict privacy policy, and as a company with a reputation to uphold, would not survive for one week if they were selling this information to other parties.
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:55:52
They don't need to be mutually exclusive. We're focused on being the easiest place to buy and sell bitcoin, and the best platform to build applications on top of bitcoin and fiat (and our resources are best spent competing in these areas). We also want to support ChangeTip, who are a valued partner on our platform (and I personally think they have been doing a great job of improving their product lately).
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:05:29
I see what you did there :)
@_date: 2015-02-13 06:42:25
We recently started checking credit cards used for instant buy. Previously, when you added (and verified) a credit card we assumed it would be valid until the expiry date. This is obviously wrong - cards can be canceled or reissued by the bank long before they expire.
What probably happened here is that you set this card up a long time ago in Coinbase for instant buy. We never actually charge credit cards for purchases, they are simply there as a backup payment method. Some time in the past, your card was reported stolen or was involved in a data breach, so your bank issued you a new one.
When we recently checked the card to see if it was still valid it failed. I can't help much with why, since that is all the info we get from the bank. When this happens, we delete the card from your account (which is why it's no longer there in your Coinbase account). However, you should be able to re-enable instant buy pretty easily on your Coinbase account by adding the new card.
If you want to follow up on this, please feel free to email support and we will be happy to help out!
@_date: 2015-02-13 06:45:07
It is still active. We're in the process of setting up a new email address for this so that we can actively monitor customer reports of phishing attacks. In the meantime, support is still fine for forwarding these also.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:02:44
This is a good point. I'll look into whether we can send these emails from a coinbase.com email address.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:39:03
We absolutely do not sell or leak user emails (or any personal information) to third parties. Please see our privacy policy: 
A weird Facebook friend request is most likely a coincidence. Some people in this thread have mentioned receiving email from Delighted - this is a legitimate company we use to send surveys. However, there is no way for spammers to get your email address from Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:24:31
Email confirmation only happens when you sign in from a device/IP we haven't seen before. It's the  protection we have against phishing.
