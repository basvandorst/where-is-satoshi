Yeah but 2 things made that screw up in liquidity possible. 1. They did a surprise launch when 4 days before they had a plan to allow withdraw ONLY. And 2. most traders (incl. myself) were looking to trade BCH-BTC and my order never went through because they never enabled it. At the end of the day they should have made their plans clear days and weeks ahead of time to allow people to prepare to build up a solid order book, AND they should have enabled bch-btc trading pair because most people weren't looking to sell it for dollars, and just wanted to exchange for btc, this would have added to a more accurate price discover (but most likely the price would have gone downhill pretty quickly - which is why they didn't).

One very limited test that would require some major changes to how transactions are organized on the blockchain. From the presentation of the test results it appears that nodes eventually get out of sync and start crashing as you get closer to 1gb, and plus that was a VERY limited test. 
From another comment: How many gigs do you think will need to be distributed throughout the world every 10 minutes for Bitcoin to meet Visa levels ? How much bandwidth/throughput will the average node require to stay up to date on an ongoing basis ? How do you think that will affect the security and decentralization model ?

Do you rip up your Visa card after every purchase ? I'm sorry but your questions tell me you don't fundamentally understand how LN works. Here is the best way I can explain it using real world fiat payment processors as an example. 
Imagine Visa, Amex, Discover, Diner's club, and MasterCard got together and decided to connect all their payment systems together, so no matter what payment processor a merchant had an account with, you could swipe your card and the network of all those connected payment processors would route your payment to the merchant. That will be the lightning network, except anyone can download some software on an average computer, and be a Visa or Amex on the lightning network, so instead of a handful of payment hubs, you will have dozens/hundreds of major hubs, all interconnected.

Transactions are based on size (bytes) of the transaction, not the btc amount within the transaction. Miners are incentivized by money to mine the most expensive fee transactions first, so if you are not in the rush and don't mind waiting few hours for confirmation you can set a low fee ( overview of mempool:  ) and eventually a miner will pick it up and mine it. If you are in a rush you can pay on the higher end and have the transaction confirmed within next couple of blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:35:19
OF COURSE NOT, not even 8mb blocks will make commerce practical - but the point of segwit is to alleviate the fee pressure and pave the way for L2 tech. 8mb blocks doesn't even reach paypal level of transactions, let alone VISA. Distributed ledger technology is possibly the slowest and least efficient database system. The only way to scale to meet the GLOBAL demand for commerce is on layer 2 tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:03:00

Satoshi made that onchain scaling comment 3 months after Bitcoin was released. There is a lot he didn't imagine would happen 3 months in.

This is based on my current understanding of LN.
Amazon would probably not be a good example because they are better off doing a custodial wallet like Coinbase where there are no transactions fee between their customers and their vendors. Lightning network is more for smaller daily transactions, and streaming payments, cups of coffee is the famous example.
With that said, let's stick with your example and assume Amazon wants to move received funds out of their main LN node everyday to pay its vendors. In this scenario Amazon has Node A with a large open channel with Node B. Customers open channels on Node A, make transactions, and at the end of the day, Amazon moves their funds from Node A to Node B and closes that channel to sell Bitcoin to pay its vendors. Node A channels can stay open so customer channels aren't closed everyday.

Lightning network works by updating a multisig transaction between channels, but this transaction isn't posted on the bitcoin network when a payment is hopped through a channel. The ONLY time a transaction on the lightning network requires it to be in a block on the chain is for opening and closing channels. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:56
I've been here since 2012, I don't feel betrayed, in fact I feel even more optimistic because we are closer than ever to actually being able to scale Bitcoin, and we didn't fall for the race to be bottom game of increasing block everytime blocks became full - potentially creating fork after fork. If the flood of transactions from past 2 weeks had been flooding Bcash's network, you wouldn't have as big of backlog but you would still have a backlog and fees for next block wouldn't be in cents, it would be in the dollars. If you don't care about centralization and just want really cheap fees and confirmations, buy Ripple. But if you truly care about immutability, censorship resistance, and decentralization, calm down and have some patience - Rome wasn't built in a year, and we are trying to build something even better than Rome.

You do realize that 4-8mb is not enough to even match PayPal.  If growth we've experienced this past week is organic and not spam, we would need alot more increase to keep fees low.

If his ego was an altcoin it would have a higher market cap than Bitcoin. That aside, here are a couple of highlights of his career.
1. Mt.Gox - Whether or not you believe his excuse, Mt.Gox hack was exploited for months. Ask yourself, did Roger lose any money like many other big players at the time, from the hack ?
2. Convicted felon that went to jail for store farm grade explosives at his apartment building, selling it on ebay, and shipping it through usps - all of which is illegal 
3. He used his admin rights (thanks to his 25% investment) to blockchain.info wallets to dox a user that was wrongfully sent a refund from ver's bitcoin shop website, and refused to return the funds (50$ at the time).
4. He shamed Andreas for not investing more in bitcoin and being a millionaire like himself.
Then he had the balls to claim HE made andreas a millionaire and gets called out for it by the person that ACTUALLY sent andreas millions (verified). 
5.  He freaked out during a debate because Bcash named was used a few times (most other times it was Bitcoin cash is he requested - like a little sensitive bch). During this interview he really showed his true colors by shaming John for not being a millionaire like himself. 
6. There is much more, but he is a scam artist who got lucky with Bitcoin and now wants to destroy it because Core devs didn't approve the shitty bips and proposals he supported. Roger treats bitcoin like a business and wants it to be paypal 2.0.

It is still multisig bitcoin transactions that are updated on LN nodes, and at any point a channel can be closed by the latest tx being posted to the bitcoin network.

Yes. It's called network fee you pay to miners. If your wallet allows it, you can change the fee to something lower than what is being estimated - if you are not in a rush to get a confirmation.  Gives you an idea of what the mempool looks like and what low fees will be getting cleared on next few hours.

You do realize that right now it is cheaper to spend from segwit address ? What you are saying is wrong.

Segwit is a block size increase. If you want bigger blocksize then start asking for it from Coinbase, blockchain.info, etc...they are lagging behind others and haven't even announced any concrete implementation plans yet.
edit: People getting into Bitcoin (and altcoins) need to understand that blockchain (distributed ledger) was never built to scale to match fiat processor's level of tx/sec as a decentralized means of exchange - anyone with any knowledge about Bitcoin has known this for years, hence the reason people smarter than me have been working on layer 2 solutions. 
Edit2 : To the people pointing to an email allegedly from Satoshi to Mike hearn where Satoshi, after only three months since bitcoins release, mentions that Bitcoin can already scale beyond visa.  That was only three months, not even Satoshi could have imagined some of the technological limitations we would run into.  There is a reason the 1mb limit was introduced.  Imagine if bad actors could spend a few bitcoins and spam the chain with enough tx to fill up mempool/blocks not only to the point of higher fees but to the point of crashing  and unsyncing nodes without the bandwidth and storage requirements.  That's an easy attack vector which could be exploited the higher the blocksize limit, what would be the solution then ?  Censor what you think is spam tx on the network ?

Transfer all your funds to a segwit address, then you will only be spending with segwit.

When you walk into a coffee shop to pay with visa do you have to open an account with said coffee shop ? No. The coffee shop is on the same network (visa) and has an open account with them (channel). The Lightning network will work the same way, vendors can offer two payment options, regular bitcoin tx, and lightning tx, if you pay through lightning option, your payment gets routed to that vendor's channel through the network of connected nodes. You can view the current testnet map of nodes here :  just imagine a lot more nodes connected with each other because it will be in the best interest of every node to have connections with bigger nodes that have lots of open channels in order to get the most fees from hops through your node.

The transactions should not posted on the  blockchain after every transaction. The idea is to use ln network as a checking account for daily small tx. Only when you need to close the account (channel) would you post the final transaction on the blockchain.

Yes. This. 
ask yourself, why do you keep money in your checking, when you can just keep it in your savings account ? Because checking accounts are usually accessible on the Visa network through a debit card, which facilitates merchant payments. Why would you keep Bitcoin in a lightning channel connected to a well connected node ? Because merchants/users will be accessible through the lightning network - instantly and virtually free.

For Compact Blocks that is being utilized in Bitcoin Core running nodes: 
"An average full 1MB block announcement can be reconstructed by the receiving node with a block sketch of 9KB, plus overhead for each transaction in the block that is not in the receiving node’s mempool. The largest block sketches seen top out at a few bytes north of 20KB." [source](

Lightning Network transactions are just a fancy Bitcoin time locked, mutlisig transaction. There is no LN tokens. The whole point of LN is to create a web of nodes so that if you have a channel open with a well enough connected node, you wouldn't have to open a channel with every vendor because your payment would be routed to that vendor. Think of it like a checking account where you have a Visa debit card except Visa has a channel with amex, discover, MasterCard, etc...so doesn't matter what the vendor "accepts", the payment would get to him.

Bitcoin even at 8mb will not meet the demand of a global currency. You would have to keep increasing. Every increase you decrease node count because of increase demand for storage and bandwidth. On top of that,  communication speed between nodes start causing issues because propagating large and large blocks increase orphaned blocks.

You may want to take a look at this comment:

When network effect kicks in, there will be many nodes on the network interconnected with each other, so your existing channel will likely have a route to whatever merchant you are trying to transact with. 
Right now you can't use your Amex or Discover card with a merchant that only accepts Visa, but that wouldn't be problem if Amex, Discover, Visa, and all other fiat payment processors had payment channels open with each other - that will be the lightning network for bitcoin. The cost to run your own node will be very small, and there will be many small nodes connected to big nodes that will probably be run by big companies in the space.

Blocks on bcash are usually less than 100kb, in other words, no one uses it, if you pump as much txs to the bcash network as Bitcoin is getting right now you will be paying dollars per tx - granted it would be presumably be less than bitcoin right now but it would still cause bcash supporters to have a lightbulb moment. Also have you seen the miner distribution for bcash? It's 50% roger/Jihan clan, and 50% Unknown Chinese miner (probably Jihan too) that should worry anyone that got into Bitcoin because of decentralized money it offered. We need l2 exponential scaling capabilities, not some puny linear scale onchain that barely scratches the surface of PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:51:16
I'm saying even at 8mb right now (without segwit) it would take about 2.25hrs to clear all the transactions - that's assuming everyone in the world stopped using Bitcoin for 2 hours - which would be impossible, and god forbid the transaction rate picks up (or we get more spam). You don't sacrifice security for a small jump in scale. At the end of the day, Bitcoin right now needs to be a trustless store of value, the routing and application layers built on top of it will make it a form of payment for all other use cases (coffee). This stuff doesn't happen overnight, just like it took decades for the different layers of the internet to be established and adopted, and another decade for wide use through applications like web browsers.

Do I think exchanges are doing this ? No, they have millions of investment money and that would cause their businesses to fail pretty quickly due to a lack of trust. 
Now if you ask me do I think certain exchanges, that provide commission free trading, have customers that might manipulate the price of some cryptos (bcash on bithumb) ? Likely I would say. The shear volume required to move the price of bitcoin makes that idea a bit less likely - specially the bigger the market cap gets.
Going back to the video - this "economist" doesn't have a clue about the technology that is bitcoin, let alone how the bitcoin market operates. He is just another "doom and gloom" gold bug that is trying to sell you his book on the next dollar crash.

There is no "conversion" you just have access to bcash because they hard forked so your bitcoin private keys became bcash private keys. With that said, fuck blockchain.info.

Let me attempt to clear things up. A bitcoin private key ALLOWS someone to spend bitcoins tied to that private key. So if your relative has your private keys, it's like giving them a debit card to your bank account - you both have the ability to spend those coins.

Lightning network will be viewed and used like a debit card service for bitcoin network. You will be able to fund an account (channel) and this account will be connected with other accounts on the network. When you wanna pay a receipt (invoice), the network routes your payment (bitcoin transaction) to the receivers account on the network. When you close your account, your latest account balance gets posted back into the bitcoin wallet you funded it from through the bitcoin blockchain. Regular bitcoin transaction fees apply for funding and closing account, while transactions between lightning "accounts" will be minimal or free (plenty of people including myself will be running free nodes). 
Now if you wanna dig into how the routing and secure transfer of bitcoins through lightning channels (accounts) work, please visit

Not long ago I sent (for fun) 0.25$ USD with only a $0.27 tx fee and it only took 155min for a confirmation. This is a pretty extreme example but tx fees isn't an issue when opening a channel because when you are funding a channel you don't need the channel fund confirmed right away - think of it like opening a checking account - but a lot quicker since you don't have to drive to the bank, fill out paperwork, etc. The benefit would be instant payment through the LN of interconnected channels. The fees I was referring to in the op would be the fee for routing payment through the node to another user that you are trying to pay that also has an open channel connected to that node. I essentially wanna run a free paypal like service through lightning - with operating costs (minimal pc, bandwidth) covered by my own funds and donations. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:24:08
What some people predict will happen is there will be major nodes like visa, mastercard, discover, etc and other fiat payment networks, that most users and merchants will have open channels with, except they might all be connected to each other so your payment will find its way to its recipient you are trying to pay. 
The post above has some instructions into how to get your own personal test going with a test wallet.

I regret everything I ever bought with Bitcoin. The opportunity cost is too great for Bitcoin to be used as currency right right now. Store of value first then maybe when the gains slow to small % people will use it more readily. People use dollar instead of gold or other store of value asset because, one, it's convenient and two, if you don't use it every year it is worth 1.5% less.

I'm okay with having centralized channels like credit card networks on side chains. At the end of the day it doesn't take an expensive computer to run LN node so we may end up seeing a lot more than 5-6 but they will all be interconnected through a few degrees of separation. The users won't see any of this complexity they will just scan an invoice and send payment, the network will do routing.

Not sure how ripple work, but these nodes can be started by anyone, I'm sure there will be plenty out there (some even with free tx fees) and they will all (hopefully) be connected to each other by some degree of separation. You should really try out a test wallet yourself to see how amazingly fast it will be to pay for a service, whether online or in person.

What some predict will happen is there will be major channel networks that most be are connected to so that you don't have to open new channel to pay for your beer. Think of it like having amex, visa, MasterCard,and discover channels except they are connected to each other so your payment can be routed to a merchant on either one. Some merchants may have their own channels, in which case it would work like a gift card network where you fund a channel for that merchant and use it for future instant payments, but even then those merchants might be connected to a channel you already are connected to still your payment would get routed through fine with opening a new channel.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:42:40

The Russian collusion conspiracy was a cover for the dirty work democrats had to do to try to get hillary elected - and it didn't work so they doubled down. They played politics and lost and had to double down because that was the only card they had left. I am not even a Trump guy, I am just a tech guy that follows politics and it was pretty obvious. What shocked me was how a private firm hired by Clinton camp was able to pull enough influence in the FBI to warrant bogus fisa warrants and an investigation (started by Trump hating fbi agent) that is still ongoing.

I'll keep repeating this. 50-60%+ of volume is coming from Korea - EVERYTIME the price pumps like crazy. Miners and their big blocker minions are trying to pump it even further now that they don't have B2X as an attack on Bitcoin. Coinbase dump is around the corner and they know it.

Not sure what you mean by eventually refunded. Yes, we need some real scaling capabilities before we can compete securely with PayPal, let alone visa (20k tx per second). For now, store a value and crossborder payments is a solid foundation.

LN is open source protocol that anyone can run an implementation of, so that users can connect to those nodes and open channels. It doesn't take any heavy duty hardware to get a node up and running so the idea is the network will be very distributed, with even free nodes that would provide free hops between user channels.  
As far as your question about the difference between an exchange wallet tx and ln tx, the big difference is in the trust element. Ln tx are trustless, while if you keep your bitcoin on Coinbase you are trusting them to store and properly transact your bitcoins between internal accounts.

blockchain allows custom transactions, so you can set a pretty low fee for small transactions and if you are not in a hurry to get confirmations. I just sent myself 100$ for .24 cents - confirmation is might take hours but I'm in no rush.

You can't beat cc's global tps onchain, it's just not possible. Layer two is how you scale to the world. Block increases will come in the future, but not before further optimization and consensus.
If you want to relieve traffic you don't build more lanes on existing highways, you introduce alternate routes and means of transportation. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:43:00
I have a theory that coinbase and every other wallet that uses automatic fee estimation, drive the price of fees up by doing poor calculations in the name of user friendliness and trying to get on the next block - when the user may not need to actually get a quick confirmation. If the whole ecosystem followed a simple policy of only paying a high fee if you REALLY need a confirmation quickly, fees would be much lower as whole.

.15% is insanely cheap for credit card processing. The lowest i've run into is 2.7%, what service is he using from my own curiosity. 
With that said, yes, even with litecoin, you are waiting at least ~3 minutes for one confirmation. So unless you are willing to trust a 0-conf transaction and accept the risk that a tech-savvy person could technically double spend those transactions back to themselves before they get confirmed to you, then there is no way around that issue. For small purchases 0-conf is probably fine, but anything else you would need to wait for confirmation before you can trust that it's not going to be double spent.
With that being said, there is a solution in the near future called Lightning Network, which - simply put - is layer two network of instant and free/or dirt cheap payment channels which can be opened or closed on the bitcoin network as real bitcoin transactions - similar to checking accounts.


The simplest implementation is for a shopkeeper to just print out a qr code of his wallet address and have it near checkout. Beyond that it gets more expensive.

A bitcoin wallet holds your private key which gives you access to sign transactions with unspent bitcoins sent to addresses that that private key can unlock. 


You are probably referring to the block reward which right now is 12.5btc - this amount goes to the miner that solved the proof of work math. 


The miner that "mines" a block, also gets to keep the transaction fees associated with every transaction on that particular block.


The miner that "mines" the block gets rewarded with the block reward (12.5btc). This reward halves about every 4 years.

Transactions are added to the mempool:
Wallets will provide you with a tx ID, then there are plenty of online trackers that will allow you to view tx status/information:

@_date: 2017-11-20 15:41:02
What app is that ?
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:02:47
If you are trying to become a payment system, you are competing with a market that does hundreds of thousands of txs per second on peak times. There is no way Bitcoin blocks can scale to the size required for that. However if you can offload most of those tx to layer two networks built on top of Bitcoin, then you can bypass the block size/time limit to scale to the world.
Building more lanes on a highway tends to cause more traffic because it attracts more drivers, and there is usually a limited amount of space for even more lanes. What relieves traffic and alternative transportation networks, trains, buses, tubes, planes, etc...
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:03:49
1. Create your own offline private key/public address.
2. Send bitcoins to it. 
3. Store private key only on usb thumbdrive.
4. Encrypt usb with a pin.
5. Keep in a safe place. 
You can track the wallet by importing public address into a wallet that supports watch only account. 
Or just buy a trezor…

Wrong. Lightning Network has been tested on testnet for months now. User interfaces for it continue to be developed and are looking great and you can test them yourself on testnets. It is only a matter of time before we get some ACTUAL scale - and I'm not talking Paypal tps, I'm talking VISA. If you want PayPal2.0, go buy some centralized shitcoin or bcash.

Sound money! Many Bitcoin OGs were gold bugs before Bitcoin - even Nick Szabo's precursor to Bitcoin was called BitGold. Sound money is what we have always been after - for everything else there is Visa. No one buys regular everyday things with gold or other sound money, because the opportunity cost is too great compared to fiat. With that said, L2 networks like lightning can and might usher in more spending once adoption and ease of use improves.

You are right...Dnc leaks were nothing. 4 top level dnc execs didn't resign over the contents of their emails. Debbie Wasserman didn't resign because of her emails and internal actions against Bernie - only to promptly join Hillary's campaign.

Not sure about that...miners were more aligned with 2x, so if anything they are increasing their hash power to attempt to mine 2x and leave BTC behind at which point Coinbase would start naming b2x Bitcoin and the clusterfuck will really begin as new people buying Bitcoin end up buying b2x. The only hope is that the futures market are spot on or at best b2x holds 20% of bitcoins value, at which point it would be stupid for Coinbase to rename a coin that is worth less than the original Bitcoin.

What are you holding for ? You could have sold it for &gt;0.2 of a bitcoin (I did) back in dec-jan when that shitcoin was pumping on coinbase listing. You only hold things you expect to go up in value vs Bitcoin, because if you don't, you are better off trading it for more Bitcoins.

3100, then finish the year at 6-7.5k

Then they should implement mandatory replay protection and let the markets decide. So far on bitfinex the market is 70% on BTC and 30% on B2X. Miners will not mine at a loss for long, and will be mining Bitcoin where they make more profit.

Oh wait...I don't know what I am talking about - maybe you can help me answer your question. Here is the data points the app generates to compare to the current price index on any given day: 
The formulas I am using to calculate what the price should be any giving day to be on track to meet target prediction:
goalRate = LOG10(predictionPrice/startingPrice)/((daysRemaining+daysElapsed)/365)
parPrice = 10\^(goalRate * (daysElapsed/365)) * startingPrice

From lightning.network/docs/ 


ond (tps) on its network during the 2013 holidays[2], and currently averages
hundreds of millions per day. Currently, Bitcoin supports less than 7 trans-
actions per second with a 1 megabyte block limit. If we use an average of 300
bytes per bitcoin transaction and assumed unlimited block sizes, an equiva-
lent capacity to peak Visa transaction volume of 47,000/tps would be nearly
8 gigabytes per Bitcoin block, every ten minutes on average. Continuously,
that would be over 400 terabytes of data per year.

Assuming price of apple is $1/Apple and 1 bitcoin=$1. Then sometime in the future the price of Apple remains the same $1 but now 1 bitcoin = $2 dollars, the seller would only receive 0.5 bitcoins but the value of those bitcoins in dollar remain the same ($1). The consumer increases his purchasing power, but it makes no difference in the revenue of the apple vendor.
