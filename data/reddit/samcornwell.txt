Let's say a million transactions moving 1 Sat each. Each transaction would have a fee. Will the total value of fees for all 1 million transactions be over 1 Bitcoin?

Evening fellow Bitcoiners. I have a simple question: I notice on Blockchain that the total number of transactions is still a fairly low 434 million. Could a malicious user generate huge numbers of transactions to exponentially increase the size of the Blockchain and in effect slow it down? Perhaps a better phrase (as I'm sure this has been asked before) is that measures are in place to stop a malicious user from attempting this?
@_date: 2019-07-13 08:13:55
Correct. He's probably still sceptical, mostly because he finds the concept difficult to understand having been a paper cash carrier his whole life, but more importantly having 45 talk about it on Twitter has increased the possibilities he'll engage in it.

When you name your child something unusual a certain type of individual stands out from the crowd and will make it known that 'it's a stupid idea because that child will get bullied at school.' This, is not the fault of the parents, but rather the society surrounding them. A name is just that, a name. It is not mean to inspire nor discourage any certain feelings. Despite this I wouldn't choose to name my child 'Hitler', or a crypto trading platform 'Karpeles,'
It is unfortunate that you are stumped at the name and that branding is how you choose your products. I can assure you we take security incredibly seriously, but don't take my word for it.
*A word from our chief developer.*
*DK (Donkey Koin) is built upon a financial industry proven ORM database technology 
with a full transactional ledger. Crypto services and exchanges that are based upon NoSQL* 
*technology have a deep seated security flaw which puts users' data at risk. When we set 
out to build the Internet's first MegaWallet our primary aim was security and as these past* 
*few months have shown our concern has not been unwarranted.*
*The whole system is based upon a 'separation of concerns' ideal - separating components* 
*and restricting communication between them. This modularity gives us many benefits 
including better load balancing and future-proofing, easier maintainability to handle future 
growth and changes in the crypto world and most importantly, some very strong security*
*and no one component has enough rights to do anything damaging.*
*Of course only a fool would go into detail with regards to their security measures in place,*
*so let me finish by saying we have made every preparation possible to ensure that your 
coins and data are safe with DK.*

The fix is there, right. Correct me if I'm wrong but the ability to P2Pool could reduce the risk dramatically.

As a digital commodity, bitcoin’s spot trading market should be among the most orderly and efficient in the world. After all, bitcoin is a globally fungible good with near-zero transportation and storage costs; in a vacuum, you would expect arbitrageurs to capitalize on any discrepancy in bitcoin pricing between exchanges instantly, subject only to exchange-and market-level constraints (deposit/withdrawal times, exchange fees, hedging costs, etc.).
Public perception, however, holds almost the opposite point of view, believing the bitcoin trading market to be uniquely disorderly and inefficient, with wildly variant pricing and strange volume patterns that belie belief.
This paper will show that public perception is wrong, anchored in a bygone era and built on a foundation of bad data and false assumptions.
Using a data-driven approach, this paper will show that the modern bitcoin spot market is both significantly smaller and significantly more efficient than commonly understood. It will show that effective arbitrage keeps prices on real bitcoin spot exchanges around the world in lockstep, with meaningful pricing discrepancies eliminated in a matter of seconds. It will further show that a series of developments since December 2017 have transformed the bitcoin market, and that the bitcoin market of today bears little relationship to the bitcoin market of the past.
