It doesn't do that because it's less secure. SMS verification is vulnerable.

Aren't they using both? They're simply an exchange. They didn't remove Bitcoin.

24oi said that those detained were not US Citizens. I corrected him.
On a tangent, I also told them that green card holders, whom were targeted by Trump, had more right to be a "US Citizen" than they did.
Hence the "Also". 
We're picking on you now for doing the inability-to-comprehend-english.

Have you been living under a god dam rock?
Also, many green card holders have been living in the US far longer than you've been alive.

U.S Citizens have been held up as well.
And Legal immigrants are US citizens as soon as they become US citizens...

Re-read your first question and tell me it makes sense.

I love people who don't mind Trump and say "love him or hate him" when they're too blind in their privilege to see that some US citizens don't have the luxury to "love him or hate him" because they're literally being detained by Federal authorities. Those who can "love him or hate him" are not oppressed by his policies.

Dam this is an angry comment
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:27:53
Why would they take the effort to accept bit coin then? Businesses are already reluctant to not even accept credit card because of fees.

We're talking about this subreddit community

This entire comment section is cancer 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:14:36
I'm so confused why you feel so attacked lmao. If the only thing you got out of what I said is the name-calling, then you are completely lost and I advise you to re-read what we talked about.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:38:13
Sorry, I'm don't understand what you're saying.
I'M saying that what you say is unwelcoming 'to an entire class of humans'. You haven't spoken FOR anyone, but you have spoken AGAINST people.

There is no rule except the general life rule of being not-a-dick.
No one's forcing you to do anything bro. If being nice and not-a-dick feels like 'reading from a script', then you seriously need to go through Kindergarten again or something, sorry. You can continue your ways, I'm just calling you out for it.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:37:02
It started when 90% of the comment thread sexualized the women who wanted to know more about bitcoin. Then I called them out. Then it migrated to you saying weak women mentality. Then it migrated to you attacking PC culture, and how people are forced to say things and 'reading off scripts'. Then you said you were called worst names. No one defended any woman. I don't know why you perceive it like so.
This *is* real misogyny. This is the point that I'm trying to make. The banter *isn't* harmless because it perpetuates a culture that does not welcome women. Go to do you feel a sense of belonging? Not really, mostly because that sub is meant for women, but that's a pretty overt case. However, it applies to our case. In the comment section here (not the current state), it was literally about how the women in the pictures were prostitutes and how users wanted to bang them. See how women would feel unwelcome in our community?

So Amazon sells you something for 1 btc. After a day, the price of btc goes down 15%. 
Nah, volatility is an issue. Bitcoin isn't stable enough to be adopted.

Everything in the thread would've made the average woman uncomfortable and unwelcomed. Fortunately, normal redditors arrived to sort out the mess.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:44:19
Because it'd be profitable for them
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:54:03
And if they came on here to read these comments, we'd be back where we started.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:27:55
It's not the women are weak mentality as it isn't the victim is weak mentality when it comes to bullying. When I commented, 90% of posts were unwelcoming towards women. To simply ignore that issue and instead call people like me the real problem is just absurd, and only supports the male dominance here. You might be thinking you're speaking for women, but you're actually doing more harm than good.
