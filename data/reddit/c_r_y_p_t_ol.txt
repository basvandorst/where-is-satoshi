Lol:) What is "lots"?:)
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:57:50
This is what you pay for relative privacy. Letters from IRS are more expensive, aren't they?
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:43:30
Calling 10 btc "lots" is funny, nevertheless, cards are not the right way to pay 100k. The exact answer depends on your location and documents. Many people had luck with Bitstamp. Local gray market (cash&lt;-&gt;btc) can also do it depending on location.

Honestly, I didn't even follow alts recently but there is one thing for sure: 
When in the past if saw repeating posts asking "should I trade all my BTC for ETH/LTC/whatever" that was a 100% proven end-of-pump.. I don't know how it worked -- whether those were sincere idiots or it was a part of the game, but it worked. I clicked the sell (for btc) button and was always right.
The question is: does it work in the opposite direction?
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:06:33
It works
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:46:59
They do require a phone number. Which is easy to fake. But most importantly, nobody in the government  is going to supervise thousands private btms, it's just too expensive.

Oops, sorry. 
But Bitfinex does have bank accounts (AFAIK in Puerto Rico and Poland) and currently doesn't have any problems with banking. Many big players trade there. Most price actions happen there in fact.
P.S. Also since that's Finex, this could be a margin wall in which case a trader needed much less money. And not necessarily USD, it could be BTC as well.

Likely mining is not profitable these days but if you still want to try:
(1) decide whether you will be mining bitcoin with an ASIC (specialized hardware for doing this) or mine alts with GPU(s). I am not mining and I'm not qualified to advice.
(2) If, as you say, you know shit about this, go to nicehash.com and simply sell your hashrate.
@_date: 2018-08-05 15:33:58
Of course. The pump to 20k was entirely organic and the subsequent drop is pure manipulation. No doubt. /s

If you are so fucking clever, why are so fucking poor?
Try to trade even 10 btc on a low volume shitcoin market and see how it works. Just 10 btc, I am not talking about whales or even professional traders.
Also, maybe mr NoJoke heard about leverage? With 10x leaverage 2% on BTC/USD is actually 20%.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:53:50
And so what? What exactly is wrong with this? 
It's a free unregulated market and free reddit where any idiot can post any boolshit.
It's something wrong with you that you talk about "investments" and compare to other markets.
What exactly do you mean by "investing"? We play dangerous but very fucking profitable games here (not for everybody of course). Pump and dumps, bubbles, fake news, brigades of "influencers" convincing you to buy or sell, all the stuff.
If that matches your definition of "investing", join the game and do not complain. If not, invest elsewhere.

 &gt; What would happen if one attempts to send an amount of coins to an __IP address__ that isn't running the program?
I assume you meant bitcoin address. Everything will be fine. The transaction will be recorded on the blockchain and you will see your BTC when you start a wallet program.


A wallet should detect that and refuse transaction. In theory at least.


Coins will be lost forever.


If the owner of the address knows the seed and/or private key, he will be able to use the coins. Otherwise they will be lost forever.

Not only the price matters, the pace of change as well.
I'll give you an example with a buy order, but the logic is the same for sells, just invert the terms.
Yesterday ZRX pumped on a news. At the time I noticed it, it was trading at 180-185. I looked at the charts and set a 5 btc buy order at 170 (It was not a high volume market and those 5 btc were quite visible on the chart). Because if it QUICKLY drops to 170, it is guaranteed to bounce back and I get guaranteed profit. But instead it was slowly dropping and when the price approached 170 I REMOVED the order. Not because I am a fucking manipulator but because I realized it's not the bottom. (At the end I bought at 167 and sold at 179 but it doesn't matter for the purpose of discussion).
Traders have whole lot of reasons to set orders and then remove them. The situation changes every minute. Above is just an example from yesterday.

@_date: 2018-05-22 21:41:43
It's because you don't trade. Manipulators and bots do same TA as anyone else. They analyse the market and decide.
Example: TA says that at some point according to normal human psychology the price should stop dropping and is likely to go up. Or at least it CAN go up with little resistance. They notice this and start pumping. Until the price goes to a resistance level, where they dump. Me too.:)
It's not that some conspiracy group decides the numbers in advance. Why going against the market when they can take into account market sentiments and thus maximize profits. 
Even if there is a coordinated pump operation, they decide on strategy and targets based on TA, not on random numbers.
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:23:19

But there is no point trying to find manipulation where there is none.
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:26:47
I knoe bitcoin history. Which is the history of pumps. 
The other thing is that each pump added many new adopters =&gt; the bubble never bursted and the average price growth was kinda organic, driven by adoption.
But still the price will not go up until they pump it again. Which is too early according to the pump and dump theory.
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:03:33
Technically nothing prevents a big mining pool from doing this. 
The other thing is that unlike anonymous hackers renting hashpower, mining pools are visible entities. Most likely they will be caught and the damage to business will exceed the profits.
On the other hand mining is likely unprofitable now and this might be an exit path...

Depends on how legal is that "something" and, consequently, the level of anonymity required. Also on the country you are in.
For one-time payment you can buy on LocalBitcoins or from a bitcoin ATM.
Likely you don't even need a wallet since you can direcrly send from LocalBitcoins to the recipient.
Otherwise there are plenty of wallets for both computers and phones,. electrum.org and Copay for example.

P.s. This is why btc has been immortal so far:
(1) It has some practical non-speculative usage which creates a hard price floor.

OMG, except my dumb example there are whole lot of other strategies. Arbitrage for example. This is mostly done by bots rather than humans but nevertheless. A bot keeps a sell order hoping that due to some fluctuation somebody randomly buys while the price on other exchanges is still lower. Then equivalent amount will be bought on another exchange =&gt; small profit. Once the price approaches and a bot sees no arbitrage opportunities it removes the order.

Assuming you are from US, open account on an exchange (Coinbase/gdax, Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken), sell and withdraw to your bank account.
If your broker does not share data with IRS and you do not want to pay taxes, an alternative route is LocalBitcoins.
P.S. If you are good at forex, you might wish to send (part of) your BTC to BitMex and try BTC/USD  (use vpn if from US)

Each transaction has N inputs and M outputs. Those outputs are "coins". Each can have arbitrary value, can be 3.14 btc or 0.123 btc.
Example: 
you received 1 btc, then you received 2 btc and then you received 3 btc. You have 6 btc total in 3 outputs ("coins"). 
You send 5.5 btc to someone. Your wallet will make a transaction with 3 inputs (your "coins") and 2 outputs: 5.5 btc (for the receipient) and 0.5 btc (change for you)
3 coins became 2

When buying with fiat on an exchange you always release your identity by using a bank card or bank account. KYC or not makes no difference. 
LocalBitcoins might be the only option for anon purchase.
However, once you bought BTC, you can use non-KYC exchanges to speculate without being watched by IRS. Also you can easily wash your BTC for example via XMR.

Damnit, of course it is a bubble, stupid to argue with obvious.
But what makes bitcoin unique is that each bubble (bull run) increases adoption which in turn generates new bubble which increases adoption and the whole sequence of bubbles is one bigger bubble and that also increases adoption.

@_date: 2018-05-30 13:32:00
It's not betting as f.ex. sports betting. When you bet on sports your bets do not influence the outcome (at least in theory).
Derivatives market is different. Oversimplified explanation:
If more people open long positions they'll drive the price of the derivative contract above the spot price. Then anyone can arbitrage: buy the asset on the sport market, short the derivative and eventually collect the difference minus interest rates. That is long "bets" lead to actual purchase of the asset.
Same with shorts. Too much short "bets" would drive the price below the spot. Arbitragers would sell the asset, open long and collect the difference. That is shorts translate in real sells.
There are people that claim that derivatives distort the market in some way. Maybe. But still one should clearly understand that they are not pure "bets", they do produce actual asset buys or sells.

With taxes the point of failure is cashing out to fiat, so hiding blockchain trail is not that relevant.

This shit again. 
An arbitrage bot puts a 50btc sell order when on other exchanges the price is already a bit lower. If somebody buys from this order, they buy equivalent amount on other exchanges =&gt; small profit. With virtually zero fees this makes sense even for very small deviations. Simple arbitrage which is net zero for BTC price.
They equally do it on the buy side when profitable.
If you are so convinced that (1) it's GDAX that forms the world BTC price (2) you can manipulate the price with a 50 btc order, buy the fucking order and stop manipulation. It's only $400k

I's clearly not an issue right now, The market is dead, one simply won't be able to short enough.

Perhaps some sort of non-fatal attack that would instantly plummet the price but will not kill btc completely.

@_date: 2019-11-07 14:26:34
Bitcoin is hard to use for laundring because of volatility and other complexities.
If you are on a high margin like selling drugs, BTC should be fine, but less criminal (=&gt; less profitable) businesses are very unlikely to use bitcoin for laundring.
P.s. if BTC was actually used in laundring schemes, the price would be much higher than it is now, due to the size of the market.

If you are sending not too much (&lt; $20k) your (girl) friend can easily sell on localbitcoins -- that would be an instant card2card transfer.
For bigger amounts you'd better send USDT and (s)he would exchange OTC for paper cash. Easy up to $500k. But (s)he should know dealers. Typically USDT/RUB is slightly above USD/RUB (0.1-0.5% depending on the dealer).

How about Hydra, Dream?

@_date: 2019-11-17 17:10:44


This is in fact one of the most interesting questions for me personally -- how much BTC is actually used for something (legal or not doesn't matter).
Obviously this depends on the darknet trade volume (USD/day) and on how long on average you, vendors, keep BTC before cashing out (days). A product of 2 numbers. (That's why I asked you so many questions what you did with your BTC).

Not really but this increases chances of a fake. However my second paragraph started with "ok, if it's real". I do not exclude this possibility.


Nothing for what? To move the price it's really nothing. But it's not the OP issue.  Generally people with even 20-100 btc know the market and the infrastructure pretty well and don't post n00b questions on reddit. 


Doesn't matter. I have much less, but even to me Finex answers promptly, much faster than any other exchange (Binance, Trex, etc).

Wrt ethics: there is a big difference. Scam ICOs (they are all scams in fact), pump and dumps, shilling and a lot of other types of scams are based on CHEATING people. Scam artists CONVINCE people to do what is against their economic interests. 
On the opposite margin/stop hunting is an absolutely fair game. Everyone is on equal foot. You just play a game with clear rules, and it's for you to decide how to play, risk less or more or not play at all. And if you play, it's for you to evaluate the risks.

I'll tell you, I entered the game at 800-1200, moreover I cashed out the initial investment and all bitcoin I have comes from trading shitcoins, so the fiat price I actually paid is exactly ZERO. However I saw 16-20k and I have those prices in my mind, not 800-1200 or zero. It's how psychology works.

Let's start from the beginnig: 500 btc is a lot of money. Way above an average Bitfinex account. Typically people do not advertise having that much money. And you are "redditor for 1 day". Is this story even real?
Ok, if it's real. Like Bitfinex or not, but their business strategy has always been focusing on biger accounts. And whatever complaints people had about Finex nobody ever reported outright stealing. It's hard to believe their support is ignoring your 500 btc account.
Anyhow, even unverified accounts (like mine for example) can withdraw 50 or 100 btc/day (don't remember now), why don't you simply withdraw every day?
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:39:14
No. Because they are suckers who always need to blame somebody for whatever bad happened to them. Manipulators, Tether, exchanges, whales, regulators, everyone is to blame except them. Because they cannot admit they are suckers who bought randomly shilled shitcoin which had already been pumped 20x when they "invested".
BTW I have shit load of BTC and obviously I am not happy with the price either, but I don't freak out and blame anybody. Quietly trading shitcoins trying to at least partly compensate BTC/fiat drop.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:16:41
What's the point in this bullshit? Anyone who has ever been in countries with high inflation knows that local residents don't consider local money as money for the purpose of savings or purchases bigger than daily food expenses. Typically everything is measured in USD. Regardless of whether physical USD bills are easily available or not. If you sell/buy a car, the price is in USD. Depending on the country the payment can be either in real USD or in local currency according to the current black market rate or in both.

Looks like you have deep understanding...:)
To start with an early adopter will not go to CBOE/CME brokers, if he wants margin he will go to Finex or Mex. For many reasons. By the way many early adopters might either know Finex owners personally or at least have connections. Both Finex and Mex existed long before CME/CBOE futures. Also for non-US residents there are shit load of CFD brokers-dealers (with higher commissions though), again existed long before CME/CBOE futures.
Secondly, if you compare the volume on Mex+Finex with CME/CBOE, you'll easily find out that CME/CBOE do not matter much.
Thirdly. What you describe in countless words is not different from simply selling 1000 btc. And really this is what happened: many early adopters dumped in December. Technically there are some subtle differences related to taxes and shit, but economically shorting 1000 btc in the derivatives market has the same effect as simply selling them.

In crypto it simply does not matter. Everyone got used to that. Any idiot with money can put a wall. But (1) normally no one cares (2) anyone can dump (or buy) into that wall. Which often really happens. And anyone can wash-trade a wall. But again, no one cares.

Because nobody cares whether your node agrees or not. If your node does not like a block, it will not propagate it which is EXACTLY the same as if your node DOES NOT EXIST.

"Moving" is meaningless, the whale buys for the purpose of reselling at a higher price. Which to your surprise is what all traders are supposed to do :)
Seriously, it works only because highly leveraged trading became very popular and too many people trade too aggressively with risky positions. BitMex now has to the order of magnitude more volume than spot markets.
Whales do the math and rekt risky traders. Which is perfectly fair.
Theoretically, traders should have done same math, figure out that a squeeze is possible and trade less aggressively. Then this "manipulation" simply wouldn't work (and/or would be unprofitable for the whale).
But most of traders are amateurs and most are basically gamblers. That's why it works so well.

With cash deals you always have to treat them as potential scammers. The rule of thumb: detect if something is wrong _before_ the deal. 
Howto: scammers are thinking about how to scam when you meet. The brain is busy with something which is not part of the (expected) reality. Usually it's pretty easy to see. Imagine that you are a scammer yourself
If unsure, you can always test by doing something unusual/unexpected. They are not prepared and don't have "standard" response to your provocation. Watch the reaction. Then put yourself in their shoes and think how would you react in both cases. 
And btw use the fucking logic. They want to buy at a premium price. There are exactly 2 options: either they understand no shit in this or there have "special reasons". In either case the last thing a real buyer would like to do is to talk about family, uncles and shit. In the latter case a buyer would talk about himself as little as possible. 
And I'd avoid to deal with foreigners.

What do you mean by "manipulation"? 
Somebody places a big market order and buys shit load of bitcoin. This rekts short positions ("short squeeze") which greatly amplifies the price jump.
The initial purchase is real, there are no fakes, no social media manipulation, nobody is trying to convince you in anything, nobody is trying to make an impression. Just a perfectly valid real purchase.
It doesn't even have to be a group, it can be a single person with enough money. You can do the same -- borrow enough money and try, everyone is on equal foot.

Not sure I understand. You have fixed price in usd and you can update the price in btc/satoshi every second if you wish. However, once a user clicked the "pay" button, he would expect the btc/satoshi price to get fixed. The transaction will take some time, but now it's you, merchant, who bare the fluctuation risks. Which is not a big problem since it's close to zero on average.
Also there are shitload of payment processors that will do it all for you, so that you simply gey usd in your bank account.

During volatility prices desynchronize even on different USD exchanges simply because the price moves too fast. Therefore those numbers cannot be the same and the difference might mean nothing.

And the worst commission on foreign transactions. Something like 5% + fixed fee for using the card in another country. US banks are much better although pretty archaic as well. For the reference 1% is pretty common in many other countries.

Oh, if just for fun, then ok. Which LN wallet are you using?
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:53:06
No. They do not broadcast anything. And there is no "voting". Each node decides for itself. 
If Coinbase rejects a block, it means that Coinbase does not accept deposits in this block and deposits in ALL subsequent blocks mined "on top" of this one. (It's a block__CHAIN__).
If Coinbase is alone in this deceision, it's pretty much equivalent to simply closing the shop and exit scamming.
If the majority of other exchanges follow, that will be an interesting case of a chain split. Somebody will start mining "compatible" blocks and there will be 2 bitcoins.
A brief recap:
(1) For obvious reasons mining nodes are important since they propagate mined blocks.
(2) Miners depend on "economic nodes" because if their blocks are not accepted mining makes no sense since they cannot sell mined bitcoins. Users obviously also depend on "economic nodes".
(3) Not only nobody depends on your home node, it's not even OBSERVABLE what your home node thinks. Because in case of a disagreement it will SILENTLY (!) NOT PROPAGATE. Same as if it does not exist.
(4) There is an opinion that due to the way the propagation algorithm is implemented user nodes usually slow down the network (increase propagation latency). However I can neither confirm nor refute this.

I don't know him :) and I do not know his strategy. But I'll give you too extreme opposite examples of perfectly valid strategies.  A bit oversimplified of course.
(1) The whale does not want to own ANY bitcoin. 
He buys, then, due to the short squeeze, traders are FORCED to buy immediately after him to close positions (perhaps buy even more than he bought) and then he immediately sells to them. If it works it's instant profit within seconds. In this case he doesn't even care what happens with the price after. The market will decide, he doesn't give a shit.
(2) The whale wants to accumulate. With no margin trade you would be right, he must be quietly buying in smaller quantities. But with margin trade it's all different. In recent days we observed increasing Finex shorts with no price drop (= delayed demand). Also there could be a lot of leveraged sell orders above the current price (which he could calculate if watched the market carefully). In this case it might be MUCH cheaper to instantly buy at market price while people are unprepared. With this scenario he doesn't care much about the current price either. If it jumps -- fine. If it later drops even below his average buy price, it's meaningless if it's not possible to buy that much with no slippage.
Something in between the above and more complex strategies are also possible. But whatever the actual strategy was, he simply exploited the fact that amateur traders gamble too much short-selling BORROWED bitcoins. 
Aggressive long traders can of course be rekted in a similar way.

Dumbass, learn the basics first. Wikipedia and Investopedia are your friends.
For example simple margin trade on Finex: if you short, you outright BORROW bitcoin and sell it, but you have to fucking BUY it back from the market to RETURN the loan. Shorts don't come from thin air, you have to buy and return fucking real bitcoins. Same as if you borrowed from a friend.
Swaps/futures/cfds are slightly more complicated but the end result is pretty much the same. 
And what the fuck does it have to do with earnings, dividends and regulators??
Learn one thing: if you are burnt now, it's because you are a sucker, not because of whales/manipulations/futures/aliens.
By the way, apart from the price, bitcoin itself is doing just fine: miners mine, transactions get confirmed, DNMs work as usual.

If you are unsure, use LocalBitcoins instead.

If you trade against the market with this amount they'll rekt you immediately. And there is a known example. At best you can try trivial barts when volume is low.  To really manipulate the market and be profitable you need way way more.

He proposed a \_complementary\_ solution to get around the problems with centralized money transfer systems which is beautiful and works fine for many years. We all love bitcoin.

They can't. Cuz they are no specialists in cyber security and do not want to be. This is not a part of their business model. And clearly they don't want legal problems if something goes wrong.
I think even custodian services lile Coinbase are not good enough. If something happens, e.g 20% of Coinbase  BTC is stolen, Coinbase will go bankrupt an they'll lose access to 100% of the investment, and then for they next 5 years they'll be in a court as creditors. It's not a part of their business model either.
On the opposite ETFs perfectly fit into their business model. If an ETF is hacked and 20% is stolen, the price of ETF will drop by 20-30%. Which is no different from any poorly performing stock. Even if everything is stolen and it drops to 0. In the next report they will routinely reflect the performance of this part of the portfolio (it was a risky investment anyway) and move on. No legal problems, business as usual.
As for the commissions they are too small to care about and incomparable to legal risks.

Yet another meaningless word: "duty". Fuck duties.
It's a responsibility of the government to enforce collection of taxes. It's their fucking job. They get pay checks and shit load of other benefits for doing their job.
It's not my responsibility to help them. My responsibility is to make my life and the life of my family better. Why the fuck would I voluntarily pay the tax if I can avoid it?

A lot of early adopters' coins have been redistributed during pumps. Based on blockchain analysis ~ 30B worth of BTC was distributed during the last pump. (Google for a link).

I am fine in the country I am in. I do not need to find any islands.
I have absolutely nothing against governments collecting taxes, this is absolutely normal, modern society cannot exist with no taxes.
However it is equally normal for each individual not to be willing to pay voluntarily and pay only if there is sufficient risk of punishment. 
There is no contradiction. Government is supposed to defend interests of society as a whole (in theory at least), I care about my personal interests. At the end there is some balance.
In fact I'd prefer the government to collect taxes as well as possible. But if there are loopholes, and I find a way to avoid taxes, why the heck would I not do it?
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:59:08

To censor your transaction (almost) all miners have to collude. If only half of them are censoring, your transaction will still go through just slower which makes partial censorship void.
According to Satoshi's WP miners' economic interests are to NOT harm bitcoin =&gt; it's highly unlikely they all will collude to censor.

I don't know if it helps but here is what I think. The combination of the seed (12 words) and the derivation path provide a unique set of addresses. If you don't see your address, that means that either the seed is wrong or the derivation path. Wrt derivation path, contact Jaxx. Wrt seed: look at the dictionary and check each of your 12 words to see if there are similarly looking words, maybe you wrote it down wrong.

The real significance is that there must be a pump before halving. Because (1) historically this always happened (not only with BTC) (2) most of people have too low IQ to do the math properly.
After last halving BTC price continued to grow (for obviously unrelated reasons), which canbring even more people into the pre-halving pump.

Exchanges do have some advantages over regular manipulators/traders: (a) access to internal statistics (b) in principle they can use customers' money with nobody noticing this. 
But they also bear higher risks.
Besides, a good manipulation should be synchronously performed on several exchanges.
Personally I don't think exchanges are (much) involved in trading/manipulations: collecting fees and possibly selling data to manipulators would be a much safer course of actions.

Hide and perhaps sell on the black market.

How do you know? If that was a manipulation, pretty much everybody with enough money could do that.

If you wish to cash out 14-15%, you can do it NOW.
Send 1 BTC to viabtc.com, "split" it, sell the BCC future part for ~0.15 BTC. This way you get 0.15 BTC now and on Tuesday you can withdraw 1 BTC. 
Edit: checked the price, it's 0.13 now. But you can put a sell order at  0.15-0.20, it might get filled later.  
P.S. the "split" operation is reversible: if you don't sell the BCC part, you can join them back and withdraw your original BTC (before the 1st of course).

Zero probability. If they decide to try to shut down they will suppress economically.,

Don't see BCH/USD on Kraken. Am I missing something or you are BSing?
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:54:04
Thanx) The other thing is that I have no idea what to do now. I have a buy order at ~0.06 and a sell order at ~0.30. Safe but not working  strategy.((

I am not taking sides, but I'd like to remind that replay protection is built in into the BCC hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:31:31
I agree. People lost a lot of money and feel terrible. Constantly repeating "I told you about private keys" is pure sadism. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:20:24
I know it will be there after the fork. I do not see BCH "buy orders at 10 dollars" NOW.

"requires you be a chinese resident" -- wtf?
Okcoin and viabtc work with foreigners and have everything in English.
Btw I was impressed with Okcoin's customer support, they answered in LESS THAN A MINUTE. In 2 minutes the problem was solved.

You misunderstand the concept of ownership. Those are two different things: title and possession. 
Title doesn't help much if your property is lost or stolen (and not insured).

How do you know someone actually bought something?

No.

Perhaps it will be a good time to buy dumped shitcoins? Why withdraw then?

Do you mean that it was NOT a bip32 deterministic wallet with seed? Then I don't know. I am afraid you have to do it manually for each fork.

The purpose is to resell next day, not to wait for sooner or later. :)

Don't they have (almost) zero fees? Nothing surprising in this case.

Ha-ha, what if they faked dollars (or usdt) and now will have to sell btc to cover this? :) Equally valid logic.

You mean around 12 btc? Well, hard to say. 
The right time to sell was after a fakeout at 6k+. It was obvious, the breakout was gonna fail and the price would crash. I was clever enough to predict this but stupid enough to sell only half. :(
Now I'm waiting and not selling the rest. The pump right before Christmas was quite successful, so hopefully we get another one soon....

A lot of countries have various instant payment systems. Free or cheap. Some systems involve banks (f.ex. instant card2card payments), some are parallel to the banking sector. Also Europe has SEPA which is not exactly instant but still reasonably fast and cheap.
What you describe as "ancient wealth transfer system" is something specific to US and Canada and has nothing to do with crypto. Most of the world doesn't care.
To be fair: those fast/instant payment systems are normally national or regional, not global.

Copay is technically good, however many people here would not use it for political reasons.
Also Coinomi. Although it's primary purpose is shitcoins, they do it well for BTC and as a bonus you get USDT  and alts. (Actually it's the only non-custodian wallet supporting USDT)

Damn it, is there a message attached to the address saying "I am smart money, I am buying"?
This transaction [  looks like consolidation of outputs, not a purchase.
After writing so many words, could you please share with us one simple thing: how the fuck do you sense that someone bought 85k btc.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:05:02
I used SEPA. Clearly it sucks compared to modern instant payments. However it's infinitely better than US/Canadian wires. (I had bank accounts in both countries)
