I don’t always hold 2 to 2.5 whole BitCoin; but when I do, I drink Dos Equis!
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:04:38
Well, let’s just assume you’re holding a grand total of 2 to 2.5 whole coins. Those fees could be wiped out instantly the next time it goes up! ;)

When I started my adventures in Bitcoin/crypto, I was HODLing about 2.5 coins. (This was during the bull rally when it was closing in on $14k/coin.) Just before it would’ve hit $14k a coin, it went under $10k per coin. One article said, “This is the last time you’ll be able to buy Bitcoin for $9,900/coin.” Nope! Later that week it dipped to the $9,100s.
Thirty days later, from starting with somewhere between $17k-$22k principal, I came out with a little over $27k principal amount!
Regrets?? Never!! Not after earning $5k in a month!! :D 
Well... actually I did have one regret: I used RobinHood before converting all my crypto to stock and moving it off of there. Their service really sucks and I had a feeling that the longer I kept my crypto in RobinHood, the more likely it was that all my money would just “disappear”.
Other than that life is AWESOME!!!

They know “2 Girls One Cup” and “Goatse” are in your browsing history! They are ready to seize both your legally purchased and pirated Milli Vanilli collections! Owning and possessing and distributing Milli Vanilli is a federal crime that is punishable by you being incarcerated for 100000000000000 years and receiving the death penalty FIVE times!!

I’m assuming as long as you can mine enough blocks in the future that if your BTC holdings are large enough you can just pay for stuff closer to the point of the week when bitcoin peaks at least slightly and just eliminate the difference.

Also, I will have a 20 bedroom mansion on the island! No reason why really. It’s just more privacy for me if some of the monkeys and cats (and coconuts) follow me around and I want to find another room to masturbate in. Lol!

I want to make my own island where I can clone the dudes who sang “Macarena” in the ‘90s in a lab on the island so they can be replaced by other “Macarena”-singing clones after they die of sleep deprivation and so on! I will otherwise be alone on the island except for a bunch of monkeys and cats and coconuts to keep me company! Also stupid people will be banished from the island! I wouldn’t mind making my own island a reality show lol!

I’m on the spectrum. Part of the symptoms were that I boned a 27-year-old coke-addicted slut for 7-9 hours for about 365 nights straight when she came home high (and I was sober!). Also another symptom is that I live in a $1.2 million two-story five-bedroom mansion in the wealthiest area of San Diego free of charge! Yet another symptom is that I cheated death around 7 times. Since I’m assuming you’re a normie, the symptoms you exhibit are that you have absolutely no recourse but to get down on your knees, bow to me, and suck my big fat 13” cock! Am I correct?

That sounds a lot like my experience with GetCoinback! I “earned” $11 worth of BTC from ordering some Ray-Bans and the introductory Bitcoin offer for new members. Their Amazon Pool is completely non-transparent and I should’ve earned at least $200 worth of Bitcoin with my purchases through their referral!! They provide NO withdrawal link and say, “To redeem your BTC, just log in to your account.” I visited my account. No BTC to my wallet. Later I logged out and back in to my account. Still no BTC transferred to my wallet! Oh, to top it off BOTH of the customer support requests I sent them went completely unanswered! Not even a bot responded to my messages! Fuck those con artists! The point’s for the USERS to redeem Bitcoin, not to get the users to unknowingly forward the actual amount to the company!
