Why not just dip a toe into the pool and put like $30 worth of USD into bitcoins? You don't have to go all in, start small to figure out how it works and see what you think. This way if something gets screwed up, it won't be a big deal.
There are a ton of different viewpoints on here and around the web. I've really taken a huge interest to this all in the past 4 weeks after trying it out, and from what I can see, no one really knows what is going to happen.
There are so many conflicting viewpoints that cover just about everything related to bitcoins: Is it a bubble or not? How long till it bursts if it is? What are the pros/cons of either having a local wallet or keeping the coins with any of the various websites? What exchange should you use? And on and on.
And bitcoin is different depending on what you do with it. Some people are here joining a movement to fight the man and advocate spending bitcoins to grow it as a true alternative to fiat currency. Others are putting their money in because they trust it more than their local banks or national government. Some are buying drugs or doing things where they would prefer to remain anonymous. And of course there are speculators trying to earn money like forex traders.
So, why not figure out how you want to use it and how much you can stomach to lose on this experiment, and go from there.

Congrats! I'm in the same boat. Not rich off it, but Bitcoin is definitely making life a little easier.
