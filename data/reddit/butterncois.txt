I think that there's a growing trend of sugar daddy fetishes and financial cuckoldry within the bit-coin community.
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:21:08
Perhaps it's just euphoria induced loss of principal.

Correlations are good for Bit-coin because they make it seem as though bitcoin has intrinsic value and its price isn't entirely driven by Chinese speculators looking to avoid taxation from their communist government.

I don't know, I've edged out.

This is good for bitcoin! Community college students can't baghold anyway.
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:57:23
It can be affected by conflicts of interest of developers and forked by miners.
@_date: 2016-04-23 14:01:10
Satire that makes fun of Bit-Coin is good for Bit-Coin because it entertains clueless Bit-Coin enthusiasts while getting the word out about Bit-Coin to an uninterested audience. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 16:04:22
This is good for bitcoin because it'll help the remaining uneducated masses look the other way more quickly. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:17:18
You should introduce him to bitCoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:44:15
Natural selection is good for bitcoin. Your loss (which I'm sorry for) brought bitcoins to the hands of the strong. Financial freedom is inevitable. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:43:26
Losing debates when promoting bit-Coin is good for bit-Coin because it buys Blockstream time to fix bit-Coin. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:25:35
This is great. Early adopter privilege needs to be put into bitcoin transaction processing as well instead of plain monetary gains as FIAT money is going to collapse sooner or later. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:00:58
This is good for bitcoin because it reduces the likelihood of serious investors getting involved. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:24:58
Statism is good for bitcoin because it limits *free market* defrauding. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:23:59
People say that the 2 TPS hard limit isn't good for bitcoin but that's just not true. In reality it shields bitcoin from real world use this way making it a great, niche way to make people think they're fighting the establishment.

Not the same track, but same video, I think:
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:07:37
This is good for Bit-Coin because less demand for fossil fuels means better electricity prices. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 02:50:49
Props for the peace loving Bit-Coin community for never actually delivering on those hits, I guess. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:13:29
I think scams are good for Bit-Coin because they help decentralize natural selection. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 14:16:48
I think that use as a digital alternative to cash is good for Bit-Coin because it would help tax avoidance to be digitized as well. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:58:51
RemindMe! One Year
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:20:21
I think this is good for Bit-Coin because it might increase demand for technologies that could help the network surpass 2 transactions per second without issues. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:57:55
I think that calling openbazaar *simple* is good for Bit-Coin because it might even make people think that Bit-Coin itself is actually simple to use.  
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:11:06
I think creating a new buzzwords to make a company appear as an innovator in Fintech is good for Bit-Coin because it makes it seem as though there's so much innovation in the space. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:52:35
I think that this isn't exactly good for Bit-Coin because it's misleading. Misleading advertisement is essentially guaranteeing disappointment and therefore should not be used to attract new users. 
To explain, with Bit-Coin's volatility, it could easily be the worst performing currency depending on what time frame is chosen. Promoting speculation on such volatility could lead to significant losses. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 21:02:32
I think having a new race ignited by the block chain is good for Bit-Coin because it's going to allow for more diversity in the tech industry. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 04:01:14
I think this is good for Bit-Coin because it promotes all its rebellious uses. Not only does this encourage usage from people that are against the status quo in Islamic regimes, but it also brings more demand for better anonymizing technologies.

Wanna know what's actually going on? After the original creator and now ex owner got rid of the website by selling it, someone under a pseudonym came forth as head of operations. He paid ridiculously low rates for articles and hired new amateurs and part time writers from India, Egypt, Spain... You get the idea. Journalistic ethics were now gone, click bait titles and aggressive SEO are still the goal. They spend loads of money on designers and programmers but outright refuse to hire decent writers. Somehow the advertisers are ok with that. 
Pretty much what happens with all bitCoin news websites aside of Coindesk (which despite being the biggest bitCoin website also has close to zero investigative journalism). 
@_date: 2015-11-22 09:04:19
I see no shady ads or clickbait titles. Even comparing such an effort to newsbtc seems unfair to me.

[This website?]( 
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:38:05
I think that making Block Chain terminology even more confusing with trivial rules is good for Bit-Coin because it shields it from mass adoption. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 01:53:10
Of course I'm not trolling. The paper Petter Todd Leaked isn't on that page and the papers currently linked there [weren't there]( before his blog post (on April 21) on the matter. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 20:58:23
You've got it all wrong, doesn't exist on the premise that bitcoin is worthless. However, it's the mindset behind buttcoin that keeps bitcoin where it is, away from the layman and people's everyday life. Because buttcoin is more than just a movement, the foundations of which are based on common sense. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 08:39:34
In this moment, I am euphoric.
@_date: 2016-05-05 10:30:23
Putting the burden of development on a single person that doesn't even get paid to do it would be good for Bit-Coin.  
@_date: 2015-10-27 19:23:46
Not sure about what you're asking,  maybe? 
@_date: 2016-05-25 20:11:45
That's good for Bit-Coin. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:09:13
That's if you pay within steam.
