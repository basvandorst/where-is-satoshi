I used shapeshift.com and was scammed out of money. I submitted a ticket to the shapeshift people and they told me to make sure I always use shapeshift.io
The people who are scamming are probably trying to trick people right now by making it reroute to shapeshift.io

Hi Robtmil! Thanks for the info!! How do I check if the account is a segwit one? Should I create an account under legacy? Is there any downside to creating an account under legacy? Is there any benefit to having an account under segwit?
Are my answers here? Can anyone confirm this. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:20:49
Is it the dots under the n?
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:34:48
I disagree. I think these are awesome!
