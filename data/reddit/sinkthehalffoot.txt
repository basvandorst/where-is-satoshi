 is the one that I use.  Seems to work pretty well and update frequently.

 is only slightly behind MtGox it seems.  It's what I've been using.

A lot of people are posting that they had issues with bitInstant.  I bought last week with no issue at all.  That is my personal story and I would suggest you browse around and check what others have gone through.  Otherwise, I'd look into bitfloor and once you're settled in I would work on getting verified at other places and making everything simpler for when you want to purchase again in the future.

I did the same thing last week minus the snapple.  Great feeling isn't it?  I'm pursuing a comp sci degree right now and am excited about eventually learning enough to contribute to the bitcoin community somehow in the future.  Whether that is tools, a site, app, etc.  Enjoy the ride!

What da fuq?  Bitcoins are $120+ right now.  You're saying they will cost $84-$90 but to invest now before they go back up?  They're already past your numbers.

I think what makes Satoshi Dice so successful is the fact that you bet 'small quantities'.  We are used to dealing with currency that is set up differently so when we see numbers in front of a decimal we think that is a lot... ex: 1,000.00 vs seeing numbers after the decimal .001.  We were trained to think this way all the way up until we got involved with bitcoin.  The problem is that even .1 of a bitcoin is worth over $10 now.  So it can add up quickly.
Plus it isn't like they keep an active counter up next to your bets saying that you bet .1 bitcoin which equates to $10 every time you make a bet. Otherwise you probably wouldn't do it as often.

That is subjective and relevant to each persons situation.  To me, I value savings and tend to think very long term.  I'm only in my mid-twenties so I don't truly know what is acceptable to lose at this point.  I have a good job and am pursuing higher education.  However, I don't know what tomorrow brings.  In my current state I can lose $1000 and it doesn't mean much to my overall life.  However, if I lost my health or job, then $1000 could be considered a lot and something I shouldn't of pissed away on bitcoin.  While I am comfortable with the amount of money I have in savings, I don't know when I can ever say 'thats enough'.
I got into BitCoin because I enjoy the idea of it.  Not because it will be the next big thing (who knows?) or because it will make me money.  I enjoy that it is predominately open source and being developed.  Something I can be a part of, hopefully more so in the future. 
Having just enough to survive is great... But sometimes you have to fight hard to survive.  I want to survive comfortably.

I would say yes and no... A lot of people lost a lot of money.  It was at $260 and lost $200 in value for two days.  It all depends what happens over the weekend and into next week.  I think it's to early to subjectively say it was or wasn't a crash just yet.

Is Bob prepared to possibly lose his $5000 and not care?
I don't really have a suggestion... I bought only a few from coinbase and bitinstant... While I got my feet wet, studied the market and enjoyed the roller coaster I got verified on gox and dwolla...  Now I can transfer cash to campbx or mtgox and buy coins through either of those.  Keep the cash in your Dwolla account until you're ready to buy... This way if the site gets DDOS or what have you, your cash is still safe in your Dwolla.
Hopefully this is a semi helpful answer.

It is a good time.  The tension is there though for several individuals who bet heavily that this would continue going up, even at $260.  So some people are out a lot of money and wont come back to bitcoin.
I put in about $700 myself.  I'm out around $200 right now.  Does it suck?  Yes.  I didn't put more in then I was willing to lose though.  While we all say that we are putting money in that we can afford to lose, it's not like you can ever truly 'afford' to lose money.  By that I mean, $300 is still $300.
I'm not upset that my bitcoins lost fiat purchasing power but rather that it lost purchasing value in the bitcoin world.  Where as I was able to buy something yesterday for 1 bitcoin, it will now cost 2 or 3 bitcoins.
I was looking at buying a laptop a few nights ago with bitcoin but am holding off for right now.  I'll see what happens with the value of bitcoin over the weekend.

If you wouldn't mind attaching me too I'd appreciate it. I've been thinking about starting a bitcoin star for a few weeks now. Thanks in advance!

Sent Dwolla the cash or sent MtGox the cash from Dwolla?  I understand what you're saying about the anonymity.  It's almost as if there is no anonymity in buying bitcoin but you have it once you choose to spend the bitcoin.  I'm still a firm believe that one of bitcoins biggest pitfalls is in the way that they have to be purchased.  When I tell friends that they can use moneygram or wire money to a bank in Japan (MtGox), they get sketched out and then they think I'm throwing my money in the garbage by participating in the bitcoin economy.

Yes, his odds were less than 1% too though.  Insane luck for the lucky # to end up being 0.

Dude, it is a risk and is gambling.  My only suggestion for you though would be to put in the research, gather facts, and have a grown up talk with your mom.
I'd be honest and tell her that you could lose your $100 but at least you are 14 and will rebound from it and learn a valuable lesson now if you do lose it, rather than losing $20k when you're 25 years old.  Show her news sources, etc that show her that you know the inherent risk you may take on.

It's a great feeling isn't it?  I bought a few early last week (silly me...or not, I haven't sold.) and I remember how exciting it was.  You will find yourself reading these boards even more now and researching the world of bitcoin now that you are invested in it.  Enjoy the ride and if you ever need help with it all feel free to message me (in regards to how to buy, not should you buy or should you sell, etc).
Coinbase is one that I am registered with now to buy my coins.  It is rough because it takes so long and in between the price can fluctuate like crazy.  I suggest in the mean time you look into dwolla or other services and setting up your accounts slowly if you plan on being in it for the long haul.  I have my verification going on at the other sites but am purchasing through coinbase for the time being.

Maybe try emailing Rdio.com and their sister site Vdio.com.  Although Rdio works on a subscriptions.  I haven't messed with all of the bitcoin wallets yet but maybe Rdio would be open to it if there is a setting in the wallet that sends out your payment at 'x' date every month for you.  Never hurts to send an email, worse they can say is no.

Third time I've seen it here tonight alone.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:44:27
It's not that I dislike the fees necessarily.  I know that everyone needs to pay bills and needs to eat too.  It's that I am paying (in my opinion) large fees and that the services are not convenient.  For instance, Coin Base has something great going on over there.  Low fees, etc.  Why not allow me to credit my account with money and then in the event that I want to buy a coin, I don't have to wait 5+ days for my coin.
I guess the convenience to fee ratio just isn't at the point that I think it should be.  I also am being critical with no real suggestions on how to fix it.  I for one can't develop the resources necessary to fix this.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:42:19
They will charge you $98, but you will only receive a fraction of the coin that you would have right now.  You'll receive whatever % $98 buys on a $390 coin.
Hopefully that makes sense.

 has been working well for me.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:07:26
Like a currency exchange?  Wanting to trade a dollar for a peso.  It could work...  I wanted to buy some litecoins but they don't really have any purchasing power.  'Many' places accept bitcoins.  Only a few accept lite coins.
Pretty neat idea though.  Would be easier than having to mess with Btc-e.  I think we'll see more stuff like this once MtGox starts offering litecoins.  More services will be popping up.

After I posted this I was looking at bitfloor.  I again think it would be difficult to get friends or family to deposit money into a bank account of a individual or account that they do not know.
I can tell them that everyone on Reddit uses them and they will still look at me like I'm nuts.  
I will probably look into using BitFloor in the future though.  Great suggestion though.
