Or ericools was referring to setting of one's house free to live in the wild with other free houses.

It's obvious.
Mark Karpeles is Dorian Nakamoto.

Out of curiosity, for those of you who know the details of how these coins were "lost", is it at all possible that Kerples or MtGox actually just stole them instead?
* Lies about the protocol
* Insider trading
* All twitter messages deleted
* Site down (at least right now)
* If these 744,408 "lost" coins were still available to someone, at a later valuation of $1000/btc, that's 3 quarters of a billion dollars.

No, you said 2000 yuan, which is about $327 vs 2000 yen, which is about $20.40.  I withdrew around $500, so I expect around $480 to show up in my account.  For $1000 it will be the same 2000 yen fee, so you'll end up with around $980.

Yeah I did international wire transfer.  It's 2000 yen (yuan is Chinese and would come out to around $327) which comes out to be about $20.40 at current exchange rates.  
If you do end up doing an international bank transfer, you could end up waiting a month or more from the time you submit it.  I'm told that coinbase is pretty quick but they are currently trading at around $13/btc less than mtgox, so $1000 worth of btc bought on mtgox and traded to $ at coinbase would only be around $885.

I made a withdrawal request 7 and a half weeks ago and have yet to receive it.  Don't withdraw with MtGox.
