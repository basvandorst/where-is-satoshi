Most of these people don't look at charts.  They fomo'd and bought at highs and probably dumped more than they could afford into it.

If they were smart and ran up the market while purchasing a large amount of btc they could easily set a short price dump the market hit that price.  Set a call price pump set a short dump etc etc
It's most likely what they will do.

Futures is basically the betting of what you think a price for a commodities will be.  You either short or make a long call for a specific date
Ie barrel of oil at 40 dollars on dec20 and you can buy into that position.  But it's usually matched by some one going long for that specific date.

Regulations can be a good thing.  Most of the time they are used to destroy competition though.  So not a great thing.

Sell your bit coin to pay the banks back. Makes sense...

You sire are a pleb.  
Debts to be paid are for the upper to lower classes.  We are brainwashed to think that debt is a moral obligation.  That it is of the highest societal sin to not pay a debt. 
Debt for the rich is nothing but a tool that is abandoned once it has served its purpose.
The whole past 8 years the rich have gotten richer because they have taken out huge loans with next to no interest.  The minute they can't pay they will just wipe the debts clear.

Read that btc transactions use more power than all of Zimbabwe every day.  So neither are really that great for the environment.  But btc has the ability to be ran off alternative resources so there is that in the long run.

From what I've also read is that the miners in China are in cohoots with the coal miners and operators.  Basically they get free power coal guys get some bit coin.

Also you cant buy a fraction of a stock and than trade it.  This market may be volatile as fuck but you can enter at a much lower risk to dip your toes into day trading.

It's only because it's growth is ridiculous.  Everyone I talk to about it besides my brother doesn't give a shit about it being the new Fiat or any of the other stuff.  They see 10% gains every day and want a piece. That's all.
