Is it even possible to cash out amounts around $100 right now? What would the fee have to be?

I tried to cash out the $140 i have mined ages ago last weekend. Does the wait time of 6 days for confirmation mean it will never get picked up? How long will it be till it gets cancelled automatically?

Theoretically if everyone stopped buying save for a single person buying at 1$ and the single person selling dropped their sell price to that, so the entire market would just be 1 person buying a single btc for a dollar, the market cap would drop by hundreds of billions while only one dollar has been actually moved. In reality that would never happen of course and the money moved is normally a significant fraction of the change in market cap, but it illustrates that these two numbers are only very loosely correlated.
The market cap depends on what people think bitcoin is worth and if 100 billions go off it doesnt mean people have sold for 100bn

Yeah thats true. It will become harder to track who is trustworthy as the system grows though. Also everyone deemed trustworthy at some point is trustworthy until they are not

When 130 billion go off the market cap that doesnt mean that that anount has been moved. In fact it was at most probably just half of that that got traded in and out. The market cap is a more speculative number.
