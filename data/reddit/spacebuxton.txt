Are you in the US? If you want bitcoin fast, expect to pay 5% to 20% more (which means your goods cost 5% to 20% more).
You can do: bank acount &gt; dwolla (cost $0.25) &gt; mtgox (cost 0.6% or so) or intersango (cost free) or whatever. Might take 5 business days or more. AFAIK this is the cheapest way but it takes time.
You can do: deposit money into bank account belonging to [bitinstant]( (cost 5%) &gt; tradehill or mtgox (cost 0.6% or so).
You can do: deposit into bank account belonging to [getbitcoin]( (5%) &gt; your address.
You can do: buy moneypak (cost $5) &gt; buy from someone in [ or vendor on SR who might charge 10% to 20%.
You can find a [local]( person who will sell you some bitcoin for cash.
You can install Second Life &gt; use Paypal to buy SLL in game at a [VirWox]( ATM &gt; deposit SLL at terminal in game and [buy]( bitcoin.
Et cetera.

If a reader already knows a little about Bitcoin, that article is enough to convince them that Bitcoin is superior to Digicash, Flooz, Beenz, gold, credit cards, and Paypal. And the double spending problem has been solved.
By the way, has anyone used [bitbills]( To me, the biggest flaw with those is that to access the bitcoins you have to destroy the card; it's not reloadable. And you also have to use a QR code scanner and then [importprivkey]( fairly technical stuff. And the guy selling them is making a killing. There is one [guy]( accepting bitcoin for virtual VISA cards (card number, expiration date, etc), and he's also making a killing. Like $29.70, $24.55, or $21.15 profit each. Or $6.83, $9.74, or $14.71 CAD profit each.

1) Silk Road seized/hacked, Mtgox seized/sued/bankruptcy, Congressional hearings, arrests, botnet takes over blockchain, nobody wants to buy them anymore. Every news of a hack/theft causes panic and lowers the value and decreases confidence. Short selling and naked short selling could also keep the value down. But as long as there is at least one miner and one more buyer, maybe no crash would be permanent.
2) I think bitcoin NFC smartphone or bitcoin wallet card NFC technology and major corporations accepting it as payment would make the value rise (but it would be competing with Google Wallet). I think bitcoin taking off in China or India would make the value rise. Also if a large legitimate bank opened their own bitcoin bank and exchange. Buying/selling/using BTC has to be simple and easy and just work and doable on a smartphone. If Apple publicly embraced bitcoin, the sky's the limit.

Reading the [contracts]( page on the bitcoin wiki I had many similar ideas. Collateral, escrow, betting. But contracts are just not in any client yet AFAIK.
You also have to consider, what's the worst that could happen?
Yeah, maybe it might be fun if CS and CS:S currency was replaced with bitcoin, but that makes cheating very profitable, and losing very costly. It might be fun to bet on TF2 matches, but one side could throw a match. People could wager on SC/SC2 matches, but how do ensure no shady stuff is going on?
Server donations might be nice. But not if the value of BTC drops. Or if the operator just takes the money and runs. Maybe XBL could accept MS points or bitcoin (I suppose someone might sell MS points for bitcoin).
Involve real money during play and everything becomes serious business. Games might become more fun, or less fun. And cheating and scams become financially lucrative/disastrous.
I've also [noticed]( that players on Steam are way down, maybe because people with big GPUs are mining rather than playing games. Bitcoin mining probably won't destroy 3D gaming on the PC, but I think it will put a dent in it as long the value of BTC remains high.
There are definitely a lot of opportunities. Maybe if Zynga made casual flash/browser games/apps involving bitcoin. Maybe if the World Cyber Games got involved. I don't think bitcoin gambling/casinos/lotteries are going to go away though.
But I don't know. The idea of Bitcoin Farmville or Bitcoin Angry Birds kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

The lack of exchanges. I'm still waiting for funds to show up at Dwolla. It's a logjam, and the weekend wait is a killer.
We need bitcoin giftcards (which can be purchased with cash) available in Walmart, yesterday.
And with the volatile price, it would be nice if you could just load up a gift card with USD and when you wanted to pay someone in another country, a site would immediately convert it to the current BTC rate and into the person's local currency.
I'm also wondering about difficulty increases and whether the global transaction record will get too large to handle.
And right now, so much of the bitcoin process needs to be simplified for the end user.
To make bitcoin more ubiquitous, many charities need to start accepting bitcoin donations and publishing their addresses online or on TV commercials (maybe with QR codes or a shortened URL). For example, the Red Cross, or disaster relief in Japan.
We need mobile bitcoin apps on every Android and iPhone. We need Steam and Amazon and iTunes to accept bitcoin.
Someone could also set up a business where people text something to a number, and it loads up their bitcoin wallet -- either an e-wallet online or maybe an encrypted wallet.dat on a plastic card.

The article compares bitcoin to trading cards, but you might as well compare bitcoin to GOOG or AAPL or LNKD stock. There are corporations out there that don't pay dividends, and the only reason to buy their stock is in the hope you can sell it for more later. And trading cards can be used as money, just like cigarettes or cellphone minutes. Money is about people agreeing to use something as a symbol of value.
Bitcoin is a currency because it's a medium of exchange. It's an intermediary between objects and actions with value.
Regarding P2P networks being shut down, I think it might be interesting looking at [Grokster]( or [LimeWire]( but I don't think there's a company behind bitcoin.org. I don't know if stuff on github can be removed by court order. Although in the Github [TOS]( A.8 says 
*"You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws)."*
Maybe a new U.S. law could affect bitcoin, but it's a worldwide currency.
F.2 says
*"GitHub does not pre-screen Content, but GitHub and its designee have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any Content that is available via the Service."*
Maybe Github could take down the latest code. But bitcoin code and the white paper and tons of clients and mining programs are already out there in the open. I don't know how you stop that. Although the point about Mtgox handling 90% of the volume is a very good one.

If the hashrate decreases, the difficulty will decrease. The network wants to generate a block every 10 minutes (600 seconds). That's 2016 blocks every 2 weeks (1 block every 10 minutes is 6/hour is 144/day is 2016 per 2 weeks). If the network is generating more blocks than that in 2 weeks, difficulty will increase. If it's generating less blocks than that in 2 weeks, difficulty will decrease.( [reference]( )
[Bitcoin Watch]( shows the current difficulty, next difficulty, and hashrate in Gigahashs/s (GH/s). It also shows the number of blocks generated in the last 24 hours (currently 181) and average blocks per hour (currently 7.54). Since that is above 144/day and 6/hour, difficulty is going to increase.
(GH/s * 1000000000) / (2^32 / 600) = next difficulty
Currently the network hashrate is 11237.05 GH/s.
(11237.05 * 1000000000) / (2^32 / 600) = 1,569,797.75
Bitcoin Watch says the next difficulty will be 1,569,797, after the next 821 blocks.

And Jay Leno will be making jokes about it. And shady investment bankers will be using it as a tax shelter. And bitcoin corporations will operate above the law (even more than they do now). And someone will buy a dirty bomb with bitcoin. And there will be IPOs for bitcoin companies and someone will want the BTC ticker symbol which is currently Community Bankers Trust Corporation and I don't know how that whole thing works. And maybe people in Gitmo will be forced to mine bitcoins all day. And those funds will be used for CIA drug-running or black ops in Yemen or something. And then we're all stuck in a Philip K.

It's just more sellers than buyers. Sellers willing to take even less money for their coin. People see the value drop and panic and sell. Which is great for people who want to buy in cheaply.
While bitcoin is based on faith, it still has many uses. Online gambling, sports betting, buying illegal drugs, quick payment for auctions or classified ads. Bitcoin has been described as baseball cards, but also the ultimate offshore tax shelter.
Bitcoin could drop below $1, but for people who simply use it as a medium of exchange (ie, currency) and quickly convert it, the value of each bitcoin is irrelevant -- only the time between conversion to/from fiat currency. "Investors" and hoarders are the ones who get burned, for now.

If people trust Mtgox, Mtgox could make cards. Maybe in different BTC denominations, with QR codes of voucher codes, maybe covered with a sticker and scratch off coating.
People can use Mtgox as an e-wallet. Every Mtgox account has a BTC address people can deposit to and people can specify an address to send to. There could be a smartphone app that moves BTC from one Mtgox account to another Mtgox account (does that show up in the blockchain?) and quickly sells at market price.
Their redeemable voucher codes seem like a way to do BTC transactions without leaving a print in the blockchain.

Is bitcoin property? It will *always* be possible to take another person's bitcoin (maybe not a specific person). Bitcoin is most certainly "lootable", as we've seen in the past few weeks.
Could bitcoin ever be taxed? Maybe, I don't know. As the *neverending* blockchain gets bigger and bigger, some serious electricity will be needed to maintain it. Coal doesn't mine itself.
And if you consider transaction fees "taxes", there may come a time when every bitcoin transaction will require a transaction fee (otherwise miners won't bother with it). AFAIK, cash doesn't have a built in transaction fee (unless you consider inflation or something).
Nobody is paying workers bitcoin to build roads. So all those goods and services that will be delivered over roads are still reliant on whoever maintains the roads, ie a State.


There was plenty of tribal warfare in North America before anyone had even heard of a State. War is organized murder. And as Chris Hedges [said]( "war is a force that gives us meaning."




There will be bitcoin loans. Consider a family in India who takes a microloan and has to break bricks the rest of their life to pay it off.
Consider that sex slaves can be bought and sold for bitcoin, and nobody would be the wiser.

Its niche is digital currency. That cannot be counterfeited. Most money transactions these days are digital anyway. They just involve a lot of middlemen.
I'm sure there are lots of people that would love to pay for things with their phones. While there are already "text blah blah to blah blah" things, or [NFC trials]( bitcoin requires no banks or fees.
How can someone in China (or any foreign country) buy something off your website? How can they show appreciation for what you've published?
While flattr can already be used as a microdonation tip jar, bitcoin micropayments could be used on tons and tons of websites.
Click on an ad, someone (or you) gets paid some teeny amount in bitcoin.
Micropayments could also be used for crowdfunding or microloans or [startup funding](

AFAIK, as of February 9, 2011, there were about 5,479,200 BTC in existence. Worth $1 each.
As of now there are 6,702,600 BTC in existence. That's 1,223,400 more BTC available in the past 4 months or so. There are more coins than ever, but the value is 17x higher. I suppose that's because there are more buyers than sellers. Or demand is up because people think demand will keep going up. Or some people are just sitting on thousands and thousands of coins.
And mining BTC2 would only be as pointless as [Satoshi]( mining alone for a year or so. Granted, that would be time not spent mining BTC. But they would be betting on the next digital currency, and becoming BTC2's Satoshi. The first miner might strike it rich, if the currency takes off. BTC2 would take off if speculators saw profit in it.

I might be mistaken about some of this:
Even if a cluster of supercomputers solved every block, it would only net them 250 to 300 BTC/hour. Although someone who controls over 50% of the network's power can [do some things]( The pie chart at the bottom of Bitcoinwatch [shows]( which mining pools have the most power.
The Bitcoin network currently can do 84 PetaFLOP/s.
The fastest supercomputer in the world, [Tianhe-1]( in China, can do 2.5 PetaFLOP/s while [using]( 4.04 MW.
I think the top 500 supercomputers [combined]( can do 43.67 PetaFLOP/s, although the US does [have]( 54.8% of that share. I guess they could possibly all join an existing mining pool...
@_date: 2011-07-02 19:55:05


Yes, probably. Unless the value of BTC rises or transaction fees become very lucrative.
But currently the official client still requires the entire blockchain. As the neverending blockchain gets bigger and bigger every day, it may eventually exceed the storage space of most users (clients). It will have to be stored somewhere (maybe in the cloud, I don't know). A [headers-only]( client would solve that. Or maybe [bitcoinj]( Or [BitcoinJs](


I know. But it's the main method the US and China use to generate electricity, because it's cheap. If wind, hydro, and solar produced as much electricity for cheaper, they would be used more.


True. But the article is imagining some kind of utopia where bitcoin has demolished the State and slavery is impossible. Which will not happen.

When blocks only generate 25 BTC, the value of BTC could be much higher than now, or 2500 transactions in a block each with a .01 BTC fee would mean another 25 BTC.

Personally I think gold became valuable because it's pretty. If you've ever seen it in water, the way the light shines off of it is just electric. It's eye-catching.
This [article]( talks about gold and bitcoin. It mentions scarcity, fungibiilty, divisibility, and recognizability. Bitcoin has all those properties too. But bitcoins are much much more portable than gold. And bitcoin "may have shown the first successful widescale test" of [triple entry bookkeeping](
Although some people (invested in GoldMoney) are [promoting]( GoldMoney (which is apparently a digital currency redeemable in gold) over Bitcoin. [This]( is a rebuttal. I don't know much about it.
[This]( guy says that money, money substitutes, and illusions can all function as currency and bitcoin is an illusion; it promises nothing and has no intrinsic value.

I haven't read the entire [thread]( at the bitcoin forums, but it looks to me like the victim was a member of slush's pool, he says someone hacked into his account and changed the payout address on the account (although I don't know what that would have to do with a local wallet.dat), he had 3521 coins at [his address]( (maybe it was an e-wallet at slush's pool), and then at 2011-06-13 16:52:23, it was drained to 270 left with sends to 3 addresses. [One]( of the addresses has received 25033 BTC and later sent it off. [Another]( address received some. And [another]( address received very few BTC from tons and tons of other addresses.
Maybe one guy stole 25K BTC, but I don't think one guy had 25K BTC stolen from him. And seeing as how 25K BTC were sent to that one address from tons and tons of addresses, it sounds to me like maybe passwords at slush's pool were stolen.
[Slush's pool]( does say that on 2011-06-13 "Site was DDoSed, pool is now rejecting all connections from unknown IPs. Please follow forum thread for more information." Maybe what looked like a DDOS was a botnet bruteforce password cracking attempt. But I'm just speculating here.

If all miners immediately sell their BTC for current market price after their pool pays out, then yes, right now about $1.3 million needs to be put into the market each month to maintain the current market price.
But many miners hold onto their BTC, hoping for an increase in value. There are people who hold over 300K BTC. Anyone trying to sell large amounts of BTC on popular markets will bring the price down, by matching bid orders as they go lower and lower. One person selling 33K BTC now could bring the price down to $5.
If you're using BTC as a quick medium of exchange, the value doesn't even matter. If you're using BTC as a speculative investment, you may get burned, especially now that recent hype is dwindling. But web micropayments in BTC have not fully taken off yet, and mobile apps have not yet reached mass appeal.
BTC is like MS points for all things digital, the possibilities are endless. How does someone in the US sell a digital item to a mobile user in Asia? Bitcoin. How does a struggling newspaper make money without charging a large monthly fees to go beyond their paywall? Individual articles accessible by bitcoin. How can a direct download site charge downloaders by the GB? Bitcoin. How can any website get more money from websurfers? A tiny bitcoin payment when a user clicks on a link. How can a person or group crowdfund a project? Bitcoin.

With bitcoin, someone in the US can sell a digital item to a mobile user in Asia, a newspaper can charge tiny fees to access single articles, a direct download site can charge per GB, any website can get paid when a user clicks on a link, someone can crowdfund a project.
Anywhere a black market exists, bitcoin could be used. People can hide money from the IRS, people can launder money, people can use it as a tax shelter, people can use it to obtain illicit goods and services.
Seasteaders can trade with anybody with a smartphone, someone living on the ISS can send money to anyone on Earth, an asteroid miner can trade with others in space, moon colonists can sell a futures contract for lunar regolith, a solar energy corporation in space can sell energy to Earth, a lunar aeroponic farmer can sell product to other colonists, etc.

Some potential problems with bitcoin I see is the neverending blockchain, the problem of passwords, theft, and irreversible transactions. Oh, and also malicious forked blockchains and clients. Also, [one guy]( says the bitcoin network can only handle a maximum of 6,000 transactions an hour. Is that true?
Is it legal? Well, bit torrent is still around, and so are Linden Dollars. Although I could see exchanges being taken down for money laundering. Especially when there are services called [Bitcoin Laundry]( and BitLaunder.
I have [read]( that bitcoin "poses a direct – though entirely non-violent – threat to the state’s monopoly on counterfeiting."
And [also]( read "It should be realized that if the State, particularly one that has “oligarchicalized money and credit,” particularly one whose currency serves as the global reserve, lost it’s monopoly on money, it would likely collapse. So, it’s a bit naive to think that the State would comply with such an outcome."

Well I wish I had bought a bunch of BTC when they were under $5 recently. But really, there are thousands and thousands of stocks you could invest in instead.
Bitcoin is an excellent system for enabling micropayments over the Internet. People really need to work that out.
Bitcoin could be around for a long time. But if it gets attacked for money laundering it may scare people off. It can also be used for terrorism, so there's that.
If you're trading bitcoin for goods or services, the price really doesn't matter, as long as the buyer buys the bitcoin right before the purchase, and the seller sells the bitcoin quickly.

You can check [bitminer.info]( for a table which factors in MH/s, electricity costs, the cost of new card, etc. It can tell you how long until you break even with a new card. You want an AMD/ATI video card(s). Sometimes you can find even cheaper prices than the ones listed at bitminer (at pricegrabber, froogle, ebay, etc). For example, it listed a 5830 for $185 but it was available for a short time for $110 and $136 and $147 at various websites.
Back on June 13, a 5830 for $136 would break even in about 14 days, and a 6790 for $140 would break even in about 21 days. (I think that was when 1 BTC was worth $17.92) But as of June 19, a 6790 for $140 would break even in about 38 days. Because of the increase in difficulty it mines less BTC per day.
Also see the [wiki]( page which has already been mentioned.
There's also [this]( mining calculator.
Also, [this]( thread says in about 5 days at block 133055, the difficulty will go up to about 1247050.
Although who knows what the exchange rate will be in the near future. But [Bitcoin Watch]( does show about $17.50 at bitmarket and bitcoin2cash (which is the price MtGox is going to peg it at when it comes back, if it's to be believed.)

Say the cardmaker keeps copies of all the private keys, and sells private keys of sold cards to people on the internet for half price the face value of a card.

Great rebuttal.
Although the ability to get a refund can *sometimes* be a nice feature of Paypal or credit cards.
Also, one problem with spending bitcoin on the Internet is trust between the buyer and seller. How does the buyer know the seller will deliver as promised? How does the seller know (if the buyer used escrow) that the buyer will pay up?
Also, if it takes 10 minutes to confirm a transaction, that's not exactly instant in a retail brick-and-mortar setting.


Maybe USD exchanges, but I don't know about online businesses in foreign countries.
And while bitcoin clients *are* decentralized, I'm sure exploits and attacks will keep being attempted over time. And irc.lfnet.org (where clients connect to find other nodes) is an [obvious]( central point.
There's also [this]( "suddenly, a file can, by itself, be worth 500,000 dollars, and people are not ready for this." And also "First world residents in particular are not ready - the internet is a place with a first world quantity of wealth and a third world quantity of criminals..."

A low price that keeps getting lower isn't good for stability. Maybe it's for the better that speculative bubbles burst, but drops are not good for anyone holding bitcoin or anyone receiving bitcoin in a transaction (50% of users). (Although I'm still not sure if any exchange allows short selling). The purchasing power of people who possess any BTC is getting weaker and weaker.
@_date: 2011-06-11 17:36:24

I really don't think the UI is the reason.
Mtgox had more volume before so there were simply more buyers/sellers there. Hence the higher volume now. You're more likely to find a quick match on a bigger exchange. (There's also the lower fees for 2 weeks.)
@_date: 2011-06-28 17:08:24
Oh. Nice to meet you.
I noticed on the website when you click Create Escrow, it should say "Seller's bitcoin address."
The site also says "The first Bitcoin Escrow who protect both buyers and sellers", but a buyer could receive the goods or service and not confirm they did. I suppose a seller could use delivery confirmation if they sent something in the mail, but a scammer buyer could still refuse to confirm they received the goods/service.
How are sellers protected?

I love that you can send from a specific address.
But speaking of anonymity, does the official client (and that modified client) still connect to IRC by default ( on irc.lfnet.org, or I guess  to  as of [version]( 0.3.22)?
[This]( blog (as seen in [this]( thread) lists some things which lead me to believe bitcoin isn't very anonymous at all. And then there's [allowreceivebyip]( The blog does list "noirc=1" and "nolisten=1" as possible options to use. And using "connect=" lines instead of "addnode=" lines in the .conf file so you only connect to trusted peers. I guess it may still be difficult to associate an IP with a bitcoin address though.
Personally I've noticed on the official client that debug.log contains over 25,000 IPs in plaintext (if you search for AddAddress) which I assume are other clients or nodes. And then there is also addr.dat. I've [read]( "Bitcointools has the ability to analyze your addr.dat, which should contain nearly every node in the network if your client has been running for a while" and [this]( guy says his addr.dat has 160,000 IPs in it.

If people want to obtain bitcoin in order to use it but don't want to mine, they either have to offer goods and services or pay currency to miners (or someone down the foodchain) and have faith they'll receive bitcoin in return.
If someone trades currency for BTC on an exchange, they have to have faith that the exchange won't take the money and run.
If someone doesn't know how to code, they have to have faith in bitcoin client developers.
Until private keys in wallets are encrypted by default, a user has to have faith in their own computer security measures.
If someone is donating to a BTC address, they have to have faith that the address is correctly associated with the intended recipient.
All currencies are based on faith and confidence.

The bitcoin network hashrate is now [10958.14]( GH/s. If some entity added 10959 GH/s, they would now control over 50% of the network.
You could do that with about 15,656 GPUs that each get 700 MH/s (6990s). Say they cost $720 each. That's $11,272,320 retail (not to mention wholesale) for the GPUs alone.
AMD will eventually come out with a new graphics card that can do more MH/s than the 6990. Say the US government buys up every card with tax dollars. Or the US military industrial complex. Or the CIA. Or the NSA. Or DHS. You could probably make an order for 15,000 of the new cards and have it covered.
Say the Treasury or the IRS or the Fed or the US government starts buying up every graphics card they can find. They could use them or just hoard them to prevent other people from using them (in order to keep the network hashrate down). Or a law is passed banning FPGAs. Or say Goldman Sachs or just some rich guy like Peter Thiel or Bill Gates or Richard Branson or Elon Musk decides to build a supercomputer using $11.2 million worth of GPUs. Or comes out with a gaming console that mines bitcoin by default and directs it to their pool. 
Then it's a race to out-capacitate the entity with over 50% of the network. Google might have plenty of power to save the network, but the US government might just go to them for the plan in the first place. Or maybe the US would bribe the operator of the current biggest mining pool. Or maybe just the public news alone that government miners are coming online might be enough to make people flee to another p2p currency.
But all this supposes that the US will take bitcoin any more seriously than WoW gold or ISK. As long as commodities and stocks are traded in USD, they might not care about some geek funny money. However, a rich evil mastermind could probably control the network with $15 million.

You don't need to learn all those concepts. All people need is a user friendly app on their smartphone. Or a gift card they buy with cash at Walmart and swipe around town. Or a friendly fun mining browser-game on Facebook.
There are a lot of people in this world who like discovering new technologies and trying to be ahead/keep up with those around them. They don't want to be left behind, left out. If bitcoin is seen as some cool new exclusive thing, some in-the-know thing, teenagers live for that kind of crap. Oh, and they can sell their WoW gold or bet on sports online. You know, the World Series of Poker should start paying people in bitcoin...
Dollars work fine if you're at a local grocery store, but what if you want to pay someone in Australia and don't want any companies to take a cut?
I do worry about Goldman Sachs getting big into bitcoin. But they would be trading, not mining. Manipulating markets. AFAIK the current power of the bitcoin network is twice as powerful as the top 500 supercomputers combined. If the top 500 supercomputers all started mining tomorrow, they'd only have 1/3 the power.

Right now there are 6.5 million BTC in existence, now worth $101 million. But not everybody is selling BTC for $15.53 [USD]( many are holding.
I did see a [chart]( in [this thread]( that said the  richest guy has 4.57% of all BTC, the top 10 have 13.47% of all BTC, the top 100 have 30.16% of all BTC, the top 500 have 46.05% of all BTC, and the top 1000 have 51.05% of all BTC. But after years and years, when there are 21 million BTC in existence, the current top 1000 will only have 15.8% of all BTC.
I think it's more likely that the US government would seize the domain names of popular exchanges. But an exchange could also be set up in another country, or as a .bit domain on the namecoin network, or as a TOR hidden service (and some other end to end encryption or something).
If the US government outlawed Bitcoin and said it was money laundering, it could lead to panic. A crackdown on cash for BTC kiosks/stores or BTC gift cards you can buy in any store might cause a panic (although I don't even know if those things are legal now).
I'm more worried about what Goldman Sachs might be able to do to the value of bitcoin. There are a lot of big organized players who know a lot more about speculating than a typical bitcoin user.

I forgot about checking the card balance on blockexplorer.
But you still have to trust that nobody involved with the creation of bitbill cards ever looked at or has a record of the private key. If the news ever got out, it would destroy the business. But they could always wait 10 years or so to pull of a big quick heist (for example they could check all the addresses they've created and see which ones have the biggest balance, or write some script to move all the BTC from all of them).
Maybe if the QR code printout of the private key was encrypted with a user chosen password or something? How do you ensure the printed private key is secure?

All that means is that prices in terms of BTC will rise. The purchasing power of BTC holders is dwindling.
A few months ago, someone could buy a $50 8th of weed for 1.67 BTC (when 1 bitcoin was worth $30). Now, that same $50 8th of weed costs 21.28 BTC (when 1 bitcoin is worth $2.35).
That's no big deal for people who buy bitcoin and then immediately spend it. But it *is* a problem for people who hold BTC or who accept BTC as payment and then don't immediately sell it for USD.

Say a seller in Germany will accept euros or bitcoin, and a buyer is in Japan, and the seller doesn't want or have the ability to accept credit cards. Also, the bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous while a major credit card is not.
The immediate exchange might ease fears about volatile bitcoin values. Sellers might worry about the bitcoin they receive going down in value (in which case accepting bitcoin as payment is risky), and buyers might worry about the bitcoin they send going up in value (in which case spending bitcoin is risky).
I don't personally have any experience with international buying (and it's been a while since I've used eBay), but it looks like many global eBay sellers accept Paypal. I suppose bitcoin would be useful if you wanted to avoid Paypal, or run an online store/auction site that sells goods that are banned on eBay.
I don't know much about currency conversion or regulation, but maybe with a bitcoin intermediary one could also avoid high fees or interchange fees.

Say bitbills has a record of a private key. Later it finds out that the address has tons of BTC at it by looking on blockexplorer. They could then sell that private key to the highest bidder (who is willing to trust them). The bidder either gets scammed or successfully moves the BTC to another address. The victim posts online about it, but people online can never trust that the victim didn't just spend or move the BTC himself.
There could be a black market for private keys from stolen wallet.dat files (and all the scams that would go with it).

I doubt that. Regarding the US government, Mtgox is hosted in Japan, but uses Prolexic against DDOS attacks and Prolexic is in Florida. Mtgox also accepts Dwolla as payment, and Dwolla is located in Iowa.
Also, a government (or a middleman) could run the client and see the IP of people running the client in debug.log (search for AddAddress) or addr.dat. Or monitor the  channel on irc.lfnet.org. Then go after those IPs. Panic and fear after crackdowns might make even more people flee bitcoin.

Accepting bitcoin and selling them quickly is not that difficult. Many exchanges have bitcoin addresses where you can deposit into your account, and a vendor could just list that as his address. Then make a current sell order at the market price. This could also be automated.
For people involved with illegal drugs or gambling, PayPal and credit cards are not good options to use.
Bitcoin is simply a medium of exchange. One bitcoin can be nearly worthless, but combined the system still works. If the bitcoin system was worthless, Chuck Schumer wouldn't have ranted about it as a way of money laundering.

The article says bitcoin is not a security, but the author says in the article (and in the comments) that bitcoin exchanges or transactions on exchanges might be considered securities.
...*"Rather, I think the greater danger is that exchanges like Mt.Gox could be viewed, as a whole, to be securities."*
...*"Then the Bitcoin transaction itself might be a security under federal security law."*
I wonder if any online brokerages like E-Trade or Charles Schwab or Scottrade or TD Ameritrade or Fidelity will get involved with bitcoin. I doubt it.
Even if bitcoin is not a security, or an exchange/transaction is not a security, I think it's likely that a bitcoin exchange will taken be down for [money laundering]( (which is what Senator Schumer [said]( bitcoin is).

And the 0.3% fees.

Someone addicted to heroin or cocaine might need their drugs *now* and spend BTC to obtain it. But then they have to wait for it to come in the mail. They could also just spend cash like they've been doing for decades. Or rob a pharmacy and sell that for cash.
The people sitting on hundreds of thousands of bitcoin are looking to the future. Like people who had or bought Microsoft stock at the IPO. I don't think people are selling their Google stock to buy gasoline for their cars.
If people need something *right now*, cash is legal tender. Maybe if Leaf charging stations *only* accepted bitcoin, it would be one thing...

Miners are free to choose whether to mine or not. They'll make their own decision whether it's profitable or not.
You also don't need that many miners to keep the bitcoin network going. It's just that people see about 7200 new BTC daily up for grabs and want to get a piece of it. The network can also handle a lot more transactions than that (I'm unsure of the maximum though). $0.15/kWh also isn't a realistic average. Perhaps it would be better to look at the electricity the network uses per hour divided by the total number of people mining (or involved with bitcoin).
Many people don't look at PC gaming or console gaming or filesharing or web browsing as wasteful (although maybe they should.) As more people become interested in having their own renewable energy, miners could go off-grid.
I do think that increasing difficulty makes the system wasteful, but it's only there to prevent a rapid inflation in existing BTC. Difficulty increases when more miners come online or increase their capacity.

Buying and holding and selling higher is not stupid.
And bitcoin makes it possible for anyone to sell to anyone on the planet with internet access, with no government or central bank required.

When someone buys bitcoin, they are merely buying the right to modify the neverending public ledger, the blockchain. When someone sells bitcoin, they are merely selling that right. The blockchain knows who has what.
Bitcoin will never die as long as there is at least 1 miner working on the public ledger, and as long as there are people willing to use the public ledger as an electronic medium of exchange (although I guess just the lone miner is necessary). The value of 1 bitcoin may drop below $5, or even below one penny, but the bitcoin system, the public ledger will **still** retain its function as a medium of exchange, as long as 2 parties agree to use it.
However, in my mind, the increasing size of the public ledger is an issue, although storage prices do keep dropping. The blockchain may eventually pass 100GB, 1TB, 100TB, 1PB, and on. Who to entrust the blockchain or pieces of the blockchain to is another issue.

I do think that bitcoin mining has created a huge demand for GPUs. But I'm generally skeptical of Ray Kurzweil and the idea of the singularity.
AFAIK Bitcoin is currently the most powerful network in the world, but it's only devoted to magic beans. I wonder that if all these computers are dedicated to processing this global accounting ledger, does that take away from other viable distributed computing projects? Does increasing difficulty regarding bitcoin mean even more sucking of resources? What about electricity usage and carbon emissions used to generate that electricity? Or rare earth elements mined to produce more and more computing devices?
[This]( thread on Bitcoin Forum discusses how much it costs to produce 1 BTC. It kind of reminds me of what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said about coal, "It's the most catastrophically expensive way to boil a pot of water ever devised."
I would be interested in knowing the total electrical consumption of the bitcoin network (and how the electricity was generated).

Human nature might be the biggest problem. Hacks, theft, scams, security.
Also, the falling value of BTC is bad for people who accept BTC in transactions. It's a commodity currency and currently nobody seems to want to be left holding the hot potato. What about the ability to change the rate of production from 5 per minute? Currently the system has a goal of 2016 blocks every 14 days, so we're currently stuck producing 50 BTC per block, about every 10 minutes, for the near future, until 210,000 blocks are generated (which takes about 4 years) and then the amount of BTC generated per block is cut in half. Four years is a long time in this modern information age to be locked in to (although I think it will become 25 per block in early December 2012).
Or what if a currency began with 21 million units already minted? Currently BTC is distributed to miners in a sort of lottery, but is there another way?
Or what if the value of BTC was pegged 1:1 with the USD? The value of USD relative to other currencies changes, but it might provide more stability for a pseudo-anonymous shadow crypto-currency.
And eventually, the blockchain is going to be so big that most people who use bitcoin will not be able to host it. And the electricity currently consumed for mining is wasteful.

If the US government wanted to go after bitcoin, I guess they *might* set up an exchange, but I think it's more likely they would [seize]( the domain names of USD exchanges. In 2000, Saddam Hussein announced that Iraqi oil would be traded in euros and a US invasion followed. In Libya, Gaddafi [wanted]( to introduce the gold dinar as currency, and a US invasion followed.
I believe Mtgox has said they would [cooperate]( with any authorities. Although Mtgox is [hosted]( in [Japan]( so I don't know if it could be seized. But I think they use [Prolexic]( for an anti-DDOS service, and Prolexic is based in Florida. In my Mtgox log I've seen IPs belonging to Prolexic in Silver Spring, Maryland.
Also, Dwolla is in the US in Iowa, so the government might get info from there.
The government could also run the client and see everyone's IP in debug.log and addr.dat. Or monitor the  channel on irc.lfnet.org. Then go after those IPs.
There might be people in the US who use bitcoin who haven't used a US exchange or ever run the bitcoin client, but they're probably a minority.

Yeah, bitbills have two QR codes. One for the [address]( ("a 160-bit hash of the public portion of a public/private ECDSA keypair"). And one inside the card for the private key. You use a QR code scanner and then [importprivkey]( on linux.
With bitbills, you supposedly know the bitcoins are good because of 2 security holograms and the card has to be destroyed to access the private key.
I don't know how large bitcoin private keys are, but a QR code can store 7098 numeric characters, or 4296 alphanumeric characters, or 2953 bytes of binary. The bitcoin wiki says "Each address takes up only about 500 bytes" and I assume that's refering to the private key.
There are also programs like [Twibright Optar]( where you can print 200K on a page.
With paper, the only way to verify the bitcoins are good is if you scanned in the code and checked the balance (and preferably sent it to a new address). Someone else could have the same paper (and access the bitcoin before you do). Then again, whoever is behind bitbills could also have the private keys on file (and access the bitcoin before you do), although they say they destroy them.

If the bitcoins were actually stolen to begin with, those last addresses could belong to a thief, or belong to Mtgox, or traders on Mtgox, or anyone really. Maybe BTC could be marked as tainted or something...
And if someone claims online that their bitcoins were stolen, how does anyone know they weren't just traded off? I guess that leads to the web of trust.

A bid and an offer to buy are the same thing. Do you mean match your low ask to the highest available bid?
No exchange should be raising your bid. A bid is the most you are willing to pay.
This was a limit sell order, meaning the seller chose how much to sell, and at what price (in this case, .47 btc for 2.99). And he could have misplaced a decimal on the price.

Putting the wrong private key (or anything really as a QR code) on the inside would be diabolical.
It seems to me that when you receive a bitbills card, the only way to be absolutely sure it is properly associated with bitcoin (and they can be sent) is to destroy the card (and then quickly send them to another address in case the cardmaker kept the private key). So I guess the card can be used for one-time really-dark-pool transactions, but you still have to put faith in the creator of the card until you can move the BTC.

Your balance on the original client will not change unless you have the entire, neverending blockchain. Your transaction is in a high block (because it's new), or AFAIK if it's very new it may not be in a block yet. You can see the latest block count [here]( You can paste your receiving address into [blockexplorer]( and it can tell you which block your transaction is in. If your client only has 129,466 blocks, it still has over 34,000 blocks to download.
Make sure port 8333 is forwarded on your machine. Then leave the client open a very long time to download the blockchain from peers. Or you could backup your wallet somewhere and try [getblockchain.com]( to download the entire blockchain. The site is more geared to linux users, but I think it could be used on Windows. I have not actually used it yet (copying it over, and copying over wallet.dat).
On the [bitcoin forums]( I've heard people talk about a client downloading the latest blocks first, or a lightweight headers only client.

If you've run the official client as least once, your IP is in someone else's (possibly most people's) debug.log or addr.dat. Or in IRC logs of irc.lfnet.org. Or if you've bought bitcoins on an exchange, your IP is probably in their server logs.
They've gone after other users of P2P networks based on their IP. I don't want to sound paranoid, but if people use bitcoin they should know what they're getting into.
Although I'm sure most bit torrent users have not been sued, it's still always a possibility.

Maybe not now, since the price isn't 2 BTC for 1 penny anymore. This [BusinessWeek]( article says how one guy bought $20,000 worth of BTC in February, sold the last of his stake when BTC hit $30, and his total return was over 1,000%.
Maybe those kinds of returns are over. But investors might put money into companies that are working on bitcoin ATMs and bitcoin gift cards and bitcoin smartphone apps and videogames involving bitcoin and bitcoin escrow services and e-wallets and Dwolla and bitcoin exchanges. If the current exchanges are *amateur*, then there is clearly a demand for a professional exchange. Fill a demand and your investment may pay off.
Most digital things are copies. Copies of copies. All the same. But bitcoin has created something digital, and unique. It can be digitally transferred globally, cannot be counterfeited, fraudsters can't print as much as they want of it, and no bank is necessary. Not even gold can do that.

Move your mouse where a line crosses a price point. Say, $17. It says about $300k required aka 18,162 BTC. That means that $300k worth of BTC need to be bought up before the price will hit $17 again. The other side, say $15. It says 4768 BTC required or $72,540. That means 4768 BTC need to be sold before the price hits $15.

I don't know. Maybe. They would be worth however much people were willing to pay for them.
There over 6.7 million bitcoin now, each worth nearly $17.
But if a new P2P currency was just starting out, and it had bigger payouts, I bet a lot of miners would want to get in on the ground floor. Maybe much like bitcoin, the currency would only be worth less than a penny for a while.
The [genesis block]( of bitcoin was created January 9, 2009. But the value of a bitcoin didn't cross $1 USD on Mtgox until [around]( February 9, 2011 ( [thread]( ). [That]( is 25 months (aka 761 days aka 18,264 hours) of generating a block (worth 50 BTC) about every 10 minutes. 300 BTC/hr x 18264 hours is 5,479,200 BTC. Suddenly these near worthless bitcoins combined were worth almost five and a half million dollars.
The network hashrate was under 10 MH/s until about [January 2010]( (which begs the question, did Satoshi [control]( over 50% of the network for a significant period of time?). In [July 2010]( the hashrate was about 1 GH/s, and the difficulty was a little over 100. As of February 7, 2011, the hashrate [was]( 186 GH/s and the difficulty was 25,998.

Recently in Forbes there was a piece called [Fear Not Deflation](


Back when the price dropped to around $2.50, that was true, and many miners did go offline, lowering the difficulty. But with a price over $100, it's a different story. And now there is mining hardware that is more energy efficient. The Avalon ASIC  gets 107 MH/joule, some FPGA hardware gets 20 to 23 MH/joule, etc. When mining becomes unprofitable for a person, they will probably stop doing it.


Profit. If someone bought in at $2.50 and sold at $140, that's 56 times what they paid for it. Or say an early miner wants to realize some of their gains. (I guess the high has been $147.)


On the Silk Road for example, all sales are done in bitcoin, and most products are pegged to USD. When the market value of bitcoin was $140, that makes the BTC prices get really really low. If someone obtained bitcoin for less than $140, they were saving money on whatever product they ordered when the market value was $140. A $100 product would have been 40 BTC when bitcoin was $2.50, but when bitcoin was $140, it's only 1.4 BTC. Say someone acquired 40 BTC back then planning to buy an item, but didn't spend it. Suddenly their purchasing power is much greater. You might ask why don't they just hold onto their BTC longer and wait to have even greater purchasing power. But that decision is really up to each consumer.
Or say someone buys a product from a foreign country. Rather than figuring out how to obtain JPY, a buyer in the US can send the seller BTC, and the seller in Japan can convert BTC to JPY whenever they want. Along with any other country.
Recently a Porsche Cayman S [sold]( for about 300 BTC using [BitPay]( (which [processed]( over $5.2 million in bitcoin transactions in March, working with over 4,500 merchants). And I'm sure the buyer obtained those 300 BTC for much less than $39,000, but now he has a Porsche.


Satoshi Nakomoto said "[Bitcoin is] completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts… With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless."
When he talked about debasing the currency, he was referring to inflation, when printing presses are just used to print more money, which makes the purchasing power of those holding the currency even less. An extreme example of inflation are [Zimdollars]( in Zimbabwe, where 100-trillion-Zimbabwean-dollar notes exist. On January 27, 2011, three 100-trillion-dollar notes were traded for 4 BTC each over  One BTC was still worth under $1 until 13 days later on February 9, 2011. At the time, the seller got under $4 in BTC for each bill. But at a current market value of $134.06/BTC, now 4 BTC is worth $536.24, over 134 times more.

What's the part no one wants Ben Milne to say?
He says "In the US, the government just reacted." While I do think that FinCEN's ["interpretive guidance"]( was viewed by many as "a statement of legitimacy" like Milne said, I also don't think it's correct to say "the government just reacted." It says "this should not be interpreted as a statement about the extent to which the user's activities comport with other federal or state statutes, rules, regulations, or orders." And "As our response is not in the form of an administrative ruling, the substance of this letter should not be considered determinative in any state or federal investigation, litigation, grand jury proceeding, or proceeding before any other governmental body."
Their guidance seems to frame every miner as an "administrator", since they are the ones that issue the currency, and if a miner "(1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason" then they qualify as a "money transmitter."
It also says "Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter", which would seem to frame every person who accepts/transmits BTC as a money transmitter, whereas the previous section says, "A user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations", MSB meaning "money services businesses."
Later it says "A person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of the convertible virtual currency and not subject to regulation as a money transmitter. By contrast, a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter." That makes it sound like a miner who has never sold BTC for USD and simply buys luxury cars with their mined BTC is merely a "user" not subject to regulation, whereas every miner who sells BTC for USD qualifies as a "money transmitter." It says "In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency." Which makes it sound like transmitting BTC to another person is enough to qualify one as a "money transmitter." But later it says "The regulations identify six circumstances under which a person is not a money transmitter, despite accepting and transmitting currency, funds, or value that substitutes for currency."

People have called bitcoin a commodity (like coffee beans), it's been [compared]( to gold, it's been called specie, it's been compared to a stock. It's also been compared to [tulip bulbs]( or collectibles like Beanie Babies (mania &amp; speculation over something others think is worthless). It's been called a scam, a pyramid scheme, a ["bitcon"]( as well as "shitcoin" &amp; The bitcoin [whitepaper]( by Satoshi Nakomoto is entitled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." So I guess it could also be described as "electronic cash" or "p2p e-cash" without the need of a financial institution. The paper proposes "a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust."
I've also read someone say "bitcoin is not a currency, bitcoin is a protocol" for online payments similar to Paypal, but with several advantages. I tend to view bitcoin as a ledger-keeping system, &amp; the ledger can be used as a medium of exchange by different parties. BitTorrent &amp; HTTP &amp; TCP/IP are also protocols, but I suppose they could also each be viewed as a medium of exchange, they each facilitate the exchange of information in their own way.
Money [functions]( as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, &amp; a standard of deferred payment. I think the bitcoin network fulfills all those functions.
[This]( piece in Forbes by Jon Matonis, entitled "Bitcoin obliterates the State theory of money", talks about the economist Georg Friedrich Knapp who wrote The State Theory of Money, published in 1924. Knapp advocated [chartalism]( the view that money must have no intrinsic value &amp; strictly be used as tokens issued by the government (or fiat money). Knapp argued that "money is a creature of law" rather than a commodity, &amp; he argued that the state could create pure paper money &amp; make it exchangeable by declaring it legal tender. The state theory of money was in contrast to metallism, where the value of a unit of currency depended on the quantity of precious metal contained within it, or the quantity it could be traded for. In [1971]( in the US, Nixon cancelled the direct convertibility of the US dollar to gold. So the US dollar is now a [floating currency]( Paul Krugman wrote that the Federal Reserve "can print as much or as little money as it deems appropriate." David Frum wrote, "If you let the currency float, you get chronic inflation punctuated by bubbles, the American lot since 1971."
In 1914, Alfred Mitchell-Innes argued that money was not a medium of exchange, but a standard of deferred payment, with government money being debt that the government could reclaim by taxation. Similar ideas are featured in the animated film [Money as Debt]( which says new money enters the economy through the indebtedness of borrowers.
In Forbes, Matonis [wrote]( "Governments have appropriated the monetary unit for their own benefit by declaring it the only preferred monetary unit for payment of taxes to the State." He said, "Control of the monetary system serves one and only one interest — the unlimited expansion of the sovereign’s spending activity to the detriment of the unfortunate users of that monetary unit. Decentralized Bitcoin obliterates this sad state of affairs." Matonis wrote, "bitcoin as a cryptographic unit seeks and gains legitimacy through the free and open marketplace. It is not a governmental instrument of legal tender that requires regulatory legitimacy and coercion by law in order to gain acceptance."
Back to the idea of money as tokens. [Friedrich Hayek]( [wrote]( about private competitive token money. That post says "Hayek believed money to be a technical problem, best solved by the market." Hayek also wrote [Denationalisation of Money]( Matonis [wrote]( "In making legal tender irrelevant, bitcoin as money indeed follows the Hayekian model of "A Free-Market Monetary System" where it has evolved, and is still evolving, from a competing currency environment."
Bitcoin is made possible by advances in cryptography &amp; peer-to-peer technology (although it maybe could have been invented [sooner]( Matonis [wrote]( that in 1991, Tatsuaki Okamoto &amp; Kazuo Ohta proposed 6 properties of ideal digital cash (secure, anonymous, portable, two-way, offline capable, divisible). The 1992 sci-fi book [Snow Crash]( described a society that was largely anarcho-capitalistic, &amp; hyperinflation led to quadrillion dollar bills being the standard small bill, &amp; for physical transactions people resort to alternative non-hyperinflated currencies. The 1995 sci-fi book [The Diamond Age]( has one character tell another that the nation-states of the world collapsed when electronic communications started using an untraceable relay system that made it impossible to enforce taxes on online transactions. In about May 2007, Satoshi Nakamoto [began]( writing the source code of bitcoin. In Nov. 2008, Satoshi [posted]( a paper on the Cryptography Mailing List describing the bitcoin protocol. The first block was mined early in Jan. 2009, &amp; on January 9, 2009, the release of Bitcoin v0.1 was [announced]( on the mailing list. In July 2010, Satoshi [posted]( on the bitcoin forums, saying "Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Dai's [b-money proposal]( on [Cypherpunks]( in 1998 and Nick Szabo's [Bitgold proposal](


It's gone from pizza &amp; alpaca socks to more &amp; more items. See the [Trade]( page at the Bitcoin Wiki, &amp; I've also seen mentions of [houses]( &amp; [Porsches]( etc. There is a payment processor called [BitPay]( which [processed]( over $5.2 million in bitcoin transactions in March, working with over 4,500 merchants.


A Porsche was sold for 300 BTC, which at the time of sale I believe was worth about $39,000 ($130/BTC). So the seller of the vehicle got something valued at $39,000. But the buyer may have obtained those 300 BTC for much less. They might have mined that BTC, or bought BTC when it was much cheaper, under $1, under $10, etc. [This thread]( &amp; [this thread]( is about using bitcoin to buy groceries.


Hyperinflation eroded the value of Zimdollars. With deflation, people can buy more goods with the same amount of money.
Satoshi Nakamoto said "If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase."
In Sept. 2011, Paul Krugman [wrote]( "if you measure prices in Bitcoins, they have plunged; the Bitcoin economy has in effect experienced massive deflation. And because of that, there has been an incentive to hoard the virtual currency rather than spending it." Many economists say deflation is bad, but Bitcoin is not a traditional currency.


There are people selling bitcoin right now, judging by the volume at the biggest exchange. If you have BTC and if you're buying goods with BTC that are priced in USD, the best time to buy the goods is when the BTC value is high. Different people may have various incentives to sell BTC. You could also view the guy who paid 300 BTC for a car as selling 300 BTC for a car.

If everyone swaps their current tax shelters for bitcoin, I don't think that necessarily makes bitcon become "legit."
Yes, if the big financial wizards who crippled the global economy pour their money into bitcoins, the price will rise, but then you're assuming they'll exhibit ethical behavior and not manipulate bitcoin just like any other former-penny-stock.

See for more information.
Basically, someone transfers bitcoin to the bot's wallet ( ), and then by typing something like bitcoinbillionaire did, they can tip another person on reddit (if the comment is posted in one of the approved subreddits that the bot watches).
Above, bitcoinbillionaire tipped someone else $100 worth of bitcoins. That person can then use that to tip other people on reddit, or they can withdraw their bitcoins from the bot's wallet to a different address, and even sell it on an exchange like MtGox, which at the time of the tip was worth $100.
Currently, that tip is worth even more than $100. Because 1.66805671 BTC at $114.40/BTC is worth $190.83, which is $90 more than a day ago.
He gave somebody $100 through Reddit (and it's now worth $190).

A person is entitled to be annoyed by erratic speculators, and high frequency trading bots, and justified in wanting rules that restrict their activity.
Incidentally, Magic: The Gathering cards also have users and [speculators]( Something printed on cardstock (and now digital), that has been valued in the thousands of dollars.
People converting USD to BTC and then BTC to USD again, are only using it as a medium of exchange for USD. (And someone converting USD to M:TG cards, and then M:TG cards to USD again, are only using it as a medium to profit with. Whether M:TG cards are a medium of exchange is highly questionable. Lots of things are bought and sold, but they don't all become mediums of exchange.)


By "make money" they mean profit (or generating it, like miners do).

Using the pizza example, if he went out and bought another $41 worth of BTC after the purchase I guess he'd have over $10 million worth of BTC now (actually $11.87 million now), but that's still half as much as he would have if he never spent the 10,000 BTC. (Instead of spending $41 worth of BTC, it seems like a 
better idea to just buy another $41 worth of BTC, at least back then. To save it or double down instead of getting rid of it or quickly replacing it.)
Yes, a person could spend BTC and then quickly buy the same amount of BTC that they spent. (Or, if someone has the option to spend dollars they could just spend dollars.)
Over the past year, the value of BTC has gone up [8900%]( So someone holding BTC can buy more than they could last month, and the month before that, etc. (Although it did go from about $13 to $266 back down to $70 and up to $1187.) I guess 1 mBTC might be more stable now, around $1.187/mBTC. (Although in the past year 1 mBTC has gone from $0.013 to $0.266 to $0.07 and now $1.187/mBTC.)
People who spent bitcoin or sold bitcoin before the current high have missed out on those gains. I suppose someone spending mBTC might regret less when it comes to dollar value, but the percentage gains are the same. mBTC has been like a wildly successful penny stock since January. The price could certainly fall though, or the price could fall and then eventually break through the current high.

Ben Milne is a founder and the CEO of [Dwolla]( a company based in Iowa, which is one of the main methods people use to deposit USD into accounts at MtGox and other bitcoin exchanges. Dwolla is also one of the main methods people use to withdraw USD from their account at MtGox (and other exchanges). Since Dwolla is used by so many bitcoin exchanges, I'm sure Dwolla gets asked all the time about their stance on bitcoin.
"My company, Dwolla, has held an agnostic position on the virtual currency since we learned about it."
"I think everyone reaching out expects me to say something incredibly damning about the virtual currency, but I don’t feel that way."
"I say this as a disclaimer: I don’t buy or own Bitcoins, and I don’t have a problem with anyone who does."
"This post isn’t for or against Bitcoin."
But bitcoin is one of the main factors that increased Dwolla's business (or why anyone has even heard of Dwolla). Which is probably why he seems "very staunchly neutral" to you.

Buyers and sellers can also use a different exchange.

I think regret over spending BTC is a valid concern. I know I've regretted spending BTC. It just wasn't worth doing.
And it was 10,000 BTC for [pizza]( in May 2010. Bitcoin forum member laszlo (Laszlo Hanyecz) bought two "The Works" Papa John's [pizzas]( from jercos. Which, at the current rate at MG ($1085.00/BTC) is now worth $10,850,000 or over $10.8 million. Yes, you could say hindsight is 20/20 and 10,000 BTC was not worth $10.8 million at the time. (I've read it was $25 worth of pizza. Someone in the thread said 10,000 BTC was worth about $41 as of May 18, 2010.) So one way to look at is that he was willing to spend $41 for pizza, and he did. But another way of looking at it is that he ate something worth ten million dollars only three-and-a-half years later. (Should I drink this wine now, or let it age a few years?)
Yes, you could say it seems he was holding that BTC for spending. But is it ever wise to spend BTC? (Is it wise to spend gold? Silver? Fine art? Antiques?) In hindsight, it was a *great* idea for jercos to sell pizza for 10,000 BTC, and if he held onto it, he basically turned two pizzas into $10 million. That's $10 million (on paper) that jercos has and laszlo no longer has. So it seems like a *much* better idea to accept BTC than to spend BTC, to keep BTC than to send BTC.
One might say it was an important milestone in the [history]( of bitcoin, demonstrating that it could be used to obtain real goods, and that regret is pointless because there are no time machines. But personally I would be haunted by it. As if I lost a winning lottery ticket.
Someone could buy $100 worth of BTC today to spend on coffee, and spend it. But the same thing could happen. That $100 worth of BTC today could be worth much more later. Much wiser to just spend dollars (which won't go from being worth $13.50 on January 1 to $1085 on November 28). For the most part, dollars are easier to obtain. Past performance is not an indication of future performance, but if there are only going to be 21 million BTC in existence, isn't there a certain rarity to them? People mention how bitcoin is highly divisible, the smallest unit of bitcoin is 0.00000001 BTC aka 1 satoshi. 1 BTC is 100 million satoshis. BTC reached dollar parity in February 2011. One BTC is 1000 millibitcoin. But millibitcoin (0.001 BTC) just reached dollar parity in November 2013, 32 months later. And 1 BTC is 1 million microbitcoin. Is microbitcoin (0.000001 BTC) ever going to reach dollar parity? (It will if 1 BTC hits $1 million. If it ever does, than that $100 worth of BTC today will be worth $100,000. Would you rather have the chance of that later or coffee now? Coffee that you can buy now with dollars?) Is a satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) ever going to reach dollar parity? (1 BTC would have to be valued at $100 million.) 1 BTC is 100 million satoshis. Eventually there will be 2.1 quadrillion satoshis.
But 50% less BTC are [awarded]( every 210,000 blocks. Currently 12,048,050 BTC BTC exist. That is 57.37% of all BTC that will ever exist. On the cryptography mailing in January 2009, Hal Finney [imagined]( that if Bitcoin becomes the dominant payment system throughout the world, then 1 BTC might be worth $10 million. (If that happens, than $100 worth of BTC today will be worth $1 million. Would you rather have the chance of that later or coffee now?)
Basically what I'm trying to say is that if you get your hands on a piece of art, should you readily trade it for a cup of coffee? And will you be kicking yourself when later you find out it was by [Francis Bacon]( (Or a better analogy might be an etching by Salvador Dali [donated]( to Goodwill and then sold for $21,000 online.)

Unless this was an April Fool's joke, I think the title of this post is confusing. I think libertarians would also be excited about bitcoin, and the two are often discussed [online]( And there are [posts]( on the official bitcoin forums like "How to end the state, while proving the free market [Austrian economic]( concept", based on ideas by [Mises and Hayek]( And [Mises]( and [Hayek]( were supposedly some of the few economists who warned of a major economic crisis before the Wall Street [crash]( of 1929.
But I have read that some libertarians claim bitcoin "fails to satisfy Mises' [regression theorem]( of primary use value prior to becoming money", and I think that goes back to the ideas of [Carl Menger]( One could Google ["bitcoin regression theorem"]( if one wanted to delve into it. Although others have [written]( "Bitcoin does NOT violate Mises' Regression Theorem."
There is also Hayek's [Denationalisation of Money]( and I have read online "In making legal tender irrelevant, bitcoin as money indeed follows the Hayekian model of "A Free-Market Monetary System" where it has evolved, and is still evolving, from a competing currency environment." I guess Hayek was against inflation and [deflation]( and deflation is often mentioned [alongside]( bitcoin, and the bitcoin wiki [discusses]( the issue of a deflationary spiral in the context of bitcoin. And there are sites asking if [hoarding]( actually hurts the bitcoin economy.
DPR's sig also links to various texts on mises.org such as [For A New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]( by [Murray Rothbard]( [Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market]( by Murray Rothbard, and [The New Libertarian Manifesto]( by [Samuel Edward Konkin III]( who was a proponent of [agorism](
You may be right that the average American does not have time to read Menger or Mises or Hayek or Rothbard (I've read basically nothing by them myself). But people don't have to have even heard of those names to use bitcoin.
Bitcoin is new. So you may be right that the wallet packs a far greater punch than talk of old economic theories.

They're not gloating, they've been overrun by a stampede of new activity. How does that fuck everyone else? How do you blame a site that gets run over, and not the mob running over it? It's the most popular site among traders (and one could argue it's gotten too popular too fast). The exchange is having growing pains (which arguably no other current USD exchange would be able to handle).
People have said not to rely on MtGox alone ever since their security breach in June 2011 (which they rebounded from). There are at least 10 other [exchanges]( that trade BTC/USD, not to mention [local traders](  etc.

Suppose someone had 1 BTC and spent it at Subway on January 1, 2013. They could have received $13.50 worth of food. Suppose they saved their 1 BTC and spent it at Subway on November 28, 2013. They could have received $1,105 worth of food. How could someone *not* kick themselves for spending their BTC on January 1? When they could have just spent dollars? They could have traded dollars for food, a perishable item, using the same dollars worth basically the same now, but instead they traded BTC, for something that was gone in a few minutes.
You said it must also make no sense to spend dollars at Subway since they could have bought bitcoin with those dollars. But for people who live in the US, obtaining dollars and spending dollars is much easier than obtaining bitcoin and spending bitcoin. Buying a sandwich with dollars is also easier than buying bitcoin with dollars. (Securing dollars is also easier than securing bitcoin. Withdrawing dollars is also easier that selling bitcoin on an exchange and withdrawing dollars.) And people spending dollars don't have to worry about those dollars being worth over 81 times more 11 months later. And someone may not have even known about bitcoin on January 1, whereas someone who spent 1 BTC on January 1 *clearly* knew about it already. When they chose to spend BTC, they didn't realize what other people might give them for it, they undervalued it.
If there is a good that a person can buy with dollars or with bitcoin in a local store, is it ever wise to spend bitcoin instead of dollars? (It's clearly a good idea to *sell* things for bitcoin, and hold onto it.) Although buying something from another country or microtransactions online are a different story.

The number of trades on MtGox reportedly tripled in the last 24 hours (a 300% increase in a single day). And the number of new accounts went from 60,000 created in all of March, to 20,000 created per day (a 1000% increase). People have been saying don't rely on MtGox for trades for years, and there are [tons]( of exchanges now (although none with the volume and therefore liquidity that MtGox has).
Regarding hassles buying coins, you can always offer goods or services to obtain bitcoin. You can also provide quality comments on Reddit, and hope someone will tip you with the bot At its simplest, obtaining coins only involves making a private wallet, and someone sending you bitcoin. They can even be bought at Walmart or 7/11.
And regarding manipulation, look at [this thread]( by a High Frequency Trading developer.
"There is no inherent interest in the underlying vehicle (Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc), rather there is enough money and activity in it such that it can be exploited."
"The volatility in the market is great from a HFT and algorithmic standpoint -- especially over the last few weeks."
So blame the HFTs and [trading bots](
There used to be a big competitor to MtGox called [TradeHill]( but they stopped accepting Dwolla for deposits in late July 2011, they "shut down and returned client funds in January 2012 due to payments fraud and regulatory uncertainty in the US", and announced in February 2013 they were closing. (Apparently they relaunched on March 18, 2013, although I can't vouch for them now.)
AFAIK, no other current exchange could handle the massive activity MtGox has been seeing. [Bitcoinwatch]( tracks over 20 exchanges besides MtGox and 10 of them besides MtGox deal in USD trades. So out of 11 exchanges that feature USD trading, people are blaming the one exchange everyone apparently flocks to, for having trouble with the disproportionate volume.

I think I know who Satoshi is, and I'm really excited by what I've found, but I also think he deserves his privacy.

When someone else has access to your wallet (like an exchange), there's always the possibility they could steal your coins.
But if an exchange wants to be successful, and earn the trust of their customers, and continue making profit on every trade, why jeopardize your reputation by stealing bitcoins?
Many services where tons of bitcoins were stolen no longer exist, there are all kinds of defunct bitcoin businesses along the wayside, while people still use MtGox. If someone doesn't trust MtGox, they shouldn't use it.
That's arguably why another exchange has not eclipsed MtGox in popularity, people are not sure which other exchanges they can trust.

The Silk Road uses bitcoin as a medium of exchange; many goods are priced in USD (and so the BTC price fluctuates), but some goods are priced only in BTC.
One could argue that as long as any drugs are illegal worldwide, there will still be a demand for bitcoin, since its design facilitates drug transactions around the world. Demand for buying illegal drugs online drives demand for bitcoin. For someone buying illegal drugs with bitcoin, it doesn't matter if 1 BTC is worth 10 grand or 10 cents. They buy as much as they need, and spend it. Like you said, if a buy order of BTC is soon followed by a sell order by a merchant, it ought to be price neutral.
Maybe one could argue that if there were no big public exchanges like MtGox, then BTC would not be as volatile as it has been. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, but the exchange volume is largely centralized in one place right now, and is mostly traded for USD (then EUR, then CNY, and 17 other currencies). But the network and the exchanges that have sprung up are still relatively new.
Many people have talked about decentralized exchanges or open-source trading platforms or Ripple (and also  and local traders).
For people only interested in bitcoin for drug transactions, a separate company like MtGox is arguably not necessary to exchange to fiat, since vendors sell money on the Silk Road (although I think BTC prices on the site are currently pegged to the MG USD price, or some average related to it).

First of all, the Bitcoin "community" is not homogeneous, there are many different people.
Second of all, MtGox is a private company that can pretty much set their own rules for trading and operating times. If people don't like those rules they can go elsewhere.
I think people want MtGox to limit [this kind of crap]( If high frequency trading bots are being used to game the system, then MtGox can (and maybe should) do something to prevent them from gaming the system.
If MtGox does restrict certain kinds of trades, that doesn't mean they're acting like a central bank. MtGox does not issue currency, miners do. MtGox exists to facilitate trades, and if some trader is causing a problem by their behavior, then MtGox is within their right to not put up with it.

I wonder if the difficulty changing every 2016 blocks might be waiting a little too long. The ideal is a block every 10 minutes, or 144 blocks per day. But 170 blocks were generated in the past 24 hours. I suppose someone could argue that that just means the difficulty will change sooner than 2 weeks. But if the network is continually finding a block quicker than 10 minutes, the network is putting out more blocks (and generating more coin) than expected. I think the halving at block 210,000 occurred sooner than initially anticipated.


I'm also very interested in smart contracts.


I think green addresses are a good way around the traditional "wait until 6 confirmations to spend" custom, and are great for point-of-sale transactions.


I'm also very interested in alternative chains to perform other functions, although I admit I haven't been following [namecoin]( for a long time (and it [appears]( that Mt. Gox is going to begin offering namecoin trading). I haven't really followed other *coin though.


Bitcoin is a planetary currency, and I think it actually could become an inter-planetary currency. In Spaceballs they talk about spacebucks (it's what my username is based on).
I think it's entirely possible that bitcoin could actually become those spacebucks. If "spacebucks" or [galactic credits]( were ever invented, what would they look like? Say you want to send money to a colony on Mars. How would you do it? You could do it with bitcoin. And someone doesn't even have to be online to receive bitcoin. Say some asteroid mining company wants to pay its employees. They could do it with bitcoin. It's a stateless currency.
In fact, that makes me wonder if bitcoin will become the "one [world currency]( that right-wing extremists fear.
