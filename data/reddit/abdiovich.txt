Still cant believe that news like this has impact on the price of btc. Get those tuna’s out of crypto. Big fishes are here to stay. I survived the fontas pump and dump times, i’ll survive this too

Same here. Made people around me rich and advised them to invest in some crypto I did a research on.  But me myself have trouble funding my own wedding this october, so I’m cashing out on crypto when I need to have fiat. Im still holding a little amount but it makes me feel happy seeing the people I brought into this community. The more the better!!

Damn.. I would lose my mind sending that amount of btc lol. ���� would triple double check the address for like hours before sending it

Dont cash out bro. you’ll regret it. Wait at least 2 more years before considering to cashing out SOME of your holdings, but dont do it now. This is one of the lowest point it can get at this time of the year. Its only up from here

I made 2 mistakes. This time I’ll hold too. In 2014 I sold just before takeoff and in 2017 I did the same. This time I aint missing the boat lol
