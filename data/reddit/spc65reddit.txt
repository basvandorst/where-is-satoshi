How about a hardware wallet that has a camera and a display, you take a photo of the QR code address you want to send to, input the amount, and then it will display a QR code for a signed transaction to that account.  You then use a smartphone to scan the signed transaction and broadcast. It wouldnt need to be online/have a copy of the BC, instead it could just keep an tab on how much is stored in the wallet.

I think this is the future of wallets.  I actually thought of this as [well](  Obviously, wallets have no business being in contact with the internet... ever.  Only transactions.  
You could make a single transaction to fund the wallet and use that as the input for all further transactions. Storing only that one transaction on the device instead of the entire BC.  
Also such a device should be equiped with a camera so that it can read QR codes for proposed  transaction ouputs.  A screen would then return a QR code with the signed inputs, an onphone app could handle all of the rest of the transaction scripting.  Im sure this could be done with a raspberry pi pretty easily (or maybe even arduino).

We are going to lose price discovery once all the exchanges are taken out.  A peg is the interim solution.  You people are full retard for not realizing that the exchanges are sitting ducks that will be picked off one by one.
