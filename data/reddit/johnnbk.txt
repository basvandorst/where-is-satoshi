There is a fee for doing so - not a huge amount but still something.  It's free to transfer from GDAX (they pay the fee) and free to transfer from Coinbase to GDAX.  So, why pay anything when you don't need to.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:27:53
No, please don't mistake these two things!!!!!!
The PIN is only relevant for the one unique, physical Ledger to allow access to your wallet.  My dog ate my Ledger a while ago (and my homework); I then got a Trezor so I can't remember exactly how to do it on a Ledger but you can set up multiple accounts on the same wallet using a password. You need this password to access the coins behind it no matter what.

I'm not an expert but I know that makes a big difference mainly because there's one less word which reduces combinations by a power (^24 v ^25) or a factor and also because word 24 is from a (massive) predefined list.
In terms of guessing the entire seed it reduces the probability from nearly almost zero to almost zero - sorry for the complex maths.

Don't keep them both in the same place; single point of failure.
If you have a "25th" word too then I'd keep the other 24 in a different location (relative's house, bank, secure place at work, etc.).

If you do have a keylogger or other malware your coins will be safer on the Trezor.  The transfer will be most dangerous time; double, treble an quadruple check the address you're sending to in Coinbase (some malware will replace Bitcoin addresses).
Transfer to GDAX first to save on miner fees.

I have to say you sound overly confident that there is a bubble and that it's about to go bang.
My take on things is that there is a bubble, it's difficult to see anything else but it's only a natural part of growing up.

I was where you are a few days ago.  I've moved to Coinfloor but that's UK so may not be of any use to you.
I spent a little time looking an exchange that was above board yet fairly small.
During the "interesting times" last week I couldn't sell high but I could buy, then after the dip I could sell but now not buy.  I lost all confidence in them at that time.
I still use them to buy then GTF because they're cheapest but would trust them as far as I could throw them.

There are lot of stories (FUD or not) about Exchanges and online wallets getting hacked.  Bitcoin (and other cryptos) are good targets because of the "anonymity" of the asset so when it's gone, it's gone.

I personally think FOMO and FUD will play a huge part.  It sounds like there are a lot of unsure and nervous holders so if the price starts to slip there will be a lot of panic sellers which will cause further drops, if the price starts to rise the same people will FOMO.
I honestly have no idea if things will rise or fall but I suspect whatever happens it will be large.

It's really easy; I mined liked a MF on my screensaver 10 years ago.  I did bugger all and got a free pizza out of it.  It only cost me 100,000 BTCs which is nothing (and I got extra cheese).
I tried the same thing last week and discovered that my lack of a hydro-electric or nuclear power station was a slight disadvantage.

Here's my take on this;
1) You have your seed which is a coded version of your key.  A long, alpha-numeric string is difficult to read, write, remember, etc. and if they showed you the actual key you'd copy/paste it which is against best practice.
2) When you use that, you'll get another.
3) Send a small amount as a trial.
4) Why do you need to move coins to GDAX to buy more coins?  
5) You'll need your 24 word seed and any "25th word" password you've used (don't store this - and never, ever, ever, ever with you seed for obvious reasons).

At 17 I'd say spend some time doing your own research and don't rush into anything.  I'm not sure what you've got 1.5k of, if it's Euros then invest the 0.5k (right now) and piss the other 1k against a wall.  Being rich when you're sixty is great but at 17 you should "fuck it all" for a few years.

It's really up to you; if you think it'll rise then buy some, if you think it'll fall don't.  Nobody knows for certain so spend some time understanding the risks and rewards and make your own decision.

It's really easy;
1) Logon to GDAX
2) Click Deposit
3) Select Source as Coinbase Wallet
4) Chose amount
5) Coins transferred
It would be more intuitive to push from Coinbase rather than pull from GDAX but that's how it works.

I don't think Coinbase has screwed you over at all.  Did your bank account really get frozen or did they just decline the transfer.
My bank (Lloyds in UK) call me 50% of the time I try to buy BTCs due to "high risk of fraud".  Which is a pain in the neck but fair enough I suppose.
Some people will say there is a conspiracy from "the man" to stop people buying BTCs.  From my experience though the bank is being sensible seeing £5k being transferred to Latvia.

This is only a guess but it'll be a lot and will vary depending on the conditions.  If there is a lot of doubt and the price is fragile it'll get knocked down a lot easier than when it's buoyant and positive.

I asked Coinbase this a while ago.  The answer was that the App is using BTC$ converted to £s while the website is using actual BTC£ rates currently trading (I suppose on GDAX).
When I asked why I got the usual Coinbase response (total silence).
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:44:04
I know that is no Sunday Opening with cryptos but when discussing ups and downs for the day the timescale makes a lot of difference.
e.g. Blockchain.info is reporting a (very slight) drop while Tradingview is a slight gain - at virtually the same price - because they use different "days".
A few exchanges use a rolling 24 hour period which I find misleading.  Last weekend I was watching a tracker that reported an almost constant 10% drop so I thought BTC was holding steady (I was little drunk).  The rolling aspect of it was the killer.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:39:54
Was that a sell/buy recommendation.  I thought it was a "hit F5 to make a 10x profit" tactic - good job I didn't have time to implement this policy.

I've used bittylicious.com a couple of times; very quick verification and uses bank transfers which are pretty much instant.
All these methods are more expensive that using an exchange.  You'll need to compare the prices yourself.
The only advantage to the Localbitcoins "cash in the bank" option is that it protects your anonymity; no direct records of buying BTC as banks don't usually care about small deposits in cash.

I have given it a lot of thought and believe it is potentially the best investment I'll ever make.
I originally worked on the basis of investing 5% of my "wealth" into BTC, it's now over 10% mainly due to increased value but also a little trickle buys.
If it goes well I'll be much better off, if it all goes wrong I won't be happy but it won't change much.
Going in for a few £k would be sensible, however treating it as short term will give you a heart attack; 50% swings aren't unheard of.  My approach is buy, keep informed but don't try to day trade, stick in a couple of hundred £ when I have some spare cash floating around on top of my "sensible" savings/investments.
As time goes on BTC will become more important and many other investments will be linked to it.  So if BTC collapses so will a lot of banks, retailers, tech firms etc. so trying to avoid BTC risks will become impossible.
Most importantly; don't expose yourself, have fun and dream

@_date: 2017-11-28 13:31:59
This sounds like the fool proof way betting on the horses, just keep betting until you win (or run out of money).  If BTC went into a long decline you'd keep investing in it and if BTC went into a long climb you'd be taking out of it.

I have no real idea about this though I suppose any financial organisation has the ability/right to close any account for any reason they like.
I lived in US (DC) for a couple of years ages ago.  This is the only reason I know what a CU is; because I had no credit history in US the major banks were really arsey with me.
A friend of mine here in UK was made bankrupt so now can only get the most basic of bank accounts which basically bans everything.  He has to buy BTC and fund online Poker accounts (same thing really) by funding a pre-paid debit card then using that.  Could that work for you?
I remember that the US was very litigious happy, that is probably why your CU is blocking BTC funding - fear of getting blamed if it goes tits up.

If I was on that spaceship I'd charge him 1000BTC to turn the oxygen supply back on.  Otherwise; his recovery phrase couldn't be too far away...

I gave up working to become a Trader during the 90's "Tech Boom".  I laughed at my stupid friends working for a living as I made 3x what I used to earn with my job.  Went on holiday, lay drunk on a Spanish beach for 2 weeks, came home and lived on cat food for a year.
The cat food thing is an exaggeration and I was in my early 20s so had time to recover but a lot of older guys had their lives changed drastically (some lost their homes).  With 20/20 retrospective vision is was a cheap lesson.

Yeah sure, it would involve you dressing up as Mr Diamond though.

Hold On for Dear Life - I think it was originally just a typo of HOLD

I think it's an exposure thing. If Joe Public puts a few £20 into a Bitcoin payment method, buys a coffee then a week later has £21 it will really spark his attention, if he has £10 he'll moan about the prices at Starbucks hopefully.

I'll drop you off on my way to the end of the Universe, which is way past New Zealand.

That will need to be proven obviously but they've obviously did something wrong.

I wouldn't think it's a good idea to carry your recovery phrase around.  Take your wallet, if you lose access to it then so be it but you should be safe.
Be careful if you're going to France; they have some very strong and strange encryption laws (basically it's seen as a weapon) and I've been asked to decrypt my laptop (work) when going there several times.

Your card will be flagged due to your age (won't allow over spending against your account as you're not allowed credit).  Your coinbase account now knows your age so will (and should) block all purchase attempts.
You may need to use ATMs and get fleeced on fees.  Spend your money on cider like a normal 17 year old and wait a year.

You logon to a phishing site or have you keys logged. Hacker then logs onto the real site and you 2FA verify them. The fact that you verified twice probably means a key logger was used, they used the first verification which didn't work for you. Sorry to hear that mate!

Sorry to joke about this.  Have you lost much (because you have lost whatever you think you can recover)?

Have a look at the transaction from the Sender account.  If it has confirmed and the Receiving account hasn't received the funds then crapping your pants is a good idea.  Probably caught up with all the spamming that has been happening so don't hold your breathe.

Not the same as now.

I wasn't sure about going the whole way and storing anything online.  If the text is well enough encrypted then it probably isn't a problem so long as the online facility is reputable.  Thanks for the reassurance.

Why should I have to, I should be able to logon and buy/sell whenever I want to?

They all pretty much do the same thing. The features too very similar within the price brackets. It's mainly a preference of interface, form factor and support. Have a look on YouTube at the interfaces and choose the one you want. I sent sent a couple of questions to Trezor and Ledger, Trezor gave better answers quicker so I went with them.

I met your Mum on Tinder ;)
Seriously (just for a second); can these figures be plotted historically. i.e. plot Market Cap of several coins over time?

Same problem here.  Will be moving out as soon as possible.  No trust left with them at all.

More that the 1183 it has now?

That's BS.  However the point of bct and other cryptos is that is's universal so look for non-Indian exchanges.
PS: Want to buy some BTC at £6000?
PPS:  Didn;t think so xx

You'd be to late then because I'd already have went forward to 3045, bought a watch then come back to 2028 and hacked the blockchain with it so I guess you wouldn't have any coins.

I've seen lots of items on eBay such as; "gift wallets with 0.00001 BTC" in Christmas boxes.  Won't the sellers know the recovery phrases for these; wait a while then reap the harvest hoping that, even a small %age, make purchases?
I was thinking of the same gift idea and looked at prepaid cards and ATM vouchers - they're all a rip off and while I think it is a great gift I don't like being screwed so I'll keep an eye on this discussion.

Glad I stayed up for that, the poor little thing was banging it's head on $9999 for about an hour. Going to chuck out my daughter's first birthday photo and replace it with a screen cap.
