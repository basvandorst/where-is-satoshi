Your points are valid.  However if we ever adopt crypto with government support it will not be BTC.  Each country/region will have their own version that overcomes all the problems of BTC.  BTC will be sort of the legacy crypto-cryptocurrency.   Most people will still accept it but it will be treated as more a grey market transaction.

Yeah no shit but none of the governments want the ease of transferring money in or out.  Impossible to tax, money laundering would be easy , etc.

This isn't physics. I teach physics.  I see you have no physics background to make that statement.  Every point this guy makes is patently false or highly debatable.  An no Bitcoin will never be a reserve currency.   Just to give an example. What he said in the physics world would be something like : axions exist, magnetic monopoles exist, supersymmetry is correct therefore dark energy is a supersymmetric force mediated by axionsand that's why we have CP violation.  None of these statements are correct and the conclusion is absurd considering that none of these are facts. But it's simple enough so it must be correct?

How do you know what they want?  Why wouldn't they want an experimental digital currency in which they have a backdoor to trace all transactions.  If it was made public that the government created it no one would trust it, particularly the people they want to track.  If it was a civilian that created this why remain anonymous?

If a country decides to adopt a crypto they would want to control the miners, the quantity, security, etc.  Imagine the US adopting a crypto with all it's miners in China.  Because if the US stupidly says, "hey, let's make BTC our local currency! ", China will let it's miners come back.  Western countries won't even allow the sale of Chinese routing/switching or mobile phones from Chinese companies you think the US will be ok with more than 50% of the miners being in control by Chinese entities?  These are the issues that some of you BTC diehards completely ignore.  Seriously, some of you don't think of the 'adult' issues of crypto.  I remember when MIT published a report on how to destroy BTC and everyone went crazy.  No! you cannot destroy BTC, FUD!.  Well they were probably given a grant to test the survivability of an electronic currency.  Look at our election system, it can easily be hacked by foreign governments.  Don't you think a study to test whether a fucking currency an survive intervention by a foreign entity be prudent?  All of you probably claim that BTC's price is manipulated by whales, even a single whale, which could be true or not and you don't think a foreign country will try to manipulate the official US crypto currency.   Whenever i read these pro-crypto arguments it sounds like it comes from a bunch of children honestly.
Edit: Think of BTC as the first transitor created vs the semiconductor versions we have now.  If a smart country ever decides to adopt a crypto it'll be in a form we don't really recognize now and will be sort of a hybrid of fiat and crypto.  Able to simulate the M0, M1, etc types of money because you need your currency to do more than enable you to buy a cup of coffee.

Drinking the Bitcoin Kool-Aid huh. Local currencies will be here in 10 years. 100 years maybe the world will start to shift.    Imagine if Trump is re-elected, you think he's going to want the same currency as China? or Iran?  He will put progress back another 50 years.

I know.. i wonder how much was actually used for a real transaction, not exchange volume.
@_date: 2018-09-01 22:15:06
I think the blockchain and underlying technology is the future but I don't think Bitcoin is good enough to be THE currency. There are too many alternatives that are better at doing what Bitcoin is supposed to do.

I thought Satoshi Nakamoto was a code name used by the NSA, the real creators of Bitcoin.

It's like the writer just learned about Bitcoin a week ago from a PowerPoint or from a conversation with a fanboy.   Reads as if a high school kid wrote this.  If it only takes you several bullet points to argue your case then it's not a good case at all.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:51:31
So how do you do it?
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:56:12
Just as the original response.  Controlling the bytes per sat to keep the transaction costs down and verifyjng within 5 to 20 minutes.  I already have the btc.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:49:26
Ok dumb question.  How do you control how many bytes per sat?  ill be sending from my exhange wallet.
