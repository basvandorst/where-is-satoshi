If you cannot imagine that there are forms of value less fungible than cash that entities are nevertheless willing to spend fungible cash to secure, I implore you to visit your nearest stock exchange.

Because you can record proof that they have not held up their end of the deal, and then nobody will trust that person to honor future deals.
edit: that's one mode of enforcement. The other is, as I'd mentioned, a context that is sufficiently anarchic that no party is trusted to manage everything, but sufficient trust is had to jointly execute violence on a disreputable actor in the system.

Yes, I'm discussing ownership information. Assume an anarchic context where multiple distrustful parties are unable to unilaterally enforce order but are together powerful enough to jointly impose violence on a minority group of themselves. Then whereas no one party can enforce your ownership of the car, together they can recognize and enforce your possession.

You sound really misinformed. Blockchain tech is useful whereever there is a multiparty need for some common information to be trusted among entities that do not trust each other. So potential applications may include coordination among allies in a war, international diplomacy, international criminal records, verifying leaked information, etc. etc.

So would you agree that blockchain tech is useful for financial instruments as well?

I'm one of those guys who don't really think BTC is the right vehicle for the dreams and ideologies people place on it, and see it simply as a bubble-prone commodity. If the last 3 huge bubbles (relative to each other, later ones make earlier ones look like dwarves because of exponential/fractional nature) are any indication, BTC bubbles are quite predictable, and it now looks quite ready to not drastically lose a lot of value but hold stable for at least a couple months, before experiencing its next bubble.
