So, removing what you don’t like, because you don’t like it? Btc is an alt coin just like any other.

Last time I check it took seconds... with my visa or cash app or Venmo or PayPal or any other of the infinite amount of providers... Xoom, western union, etc...
How long does it take bitcoin? Hours...

Or leave all your info on a website you used to purchase your "crypto," including your social and banking info.... I'll take the wheelbarrow anyday

This just shows how inexperienced crypto traders are! And yes traders, not investors
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:41:51
So the "forks" have not been pretty much the same as money making or worse? If not, we would ONLY have btc...  I think it's worse, and it means crypto isn't finite either...

Cash is more anonymous plain and simple

Designeraccount that is your OPINION, and not a fact. The single fact that you are pushing your views by tearing up what you don’t believe in is bad. That’s what America is all about... it doesn’t matter what you believe in, you have the right to do so, and others to mind their own business. There are plenty of folks that don’t think btc is garbage and there is amp support and investment for the coin.

Nah mate(love Brisbane), I know what I said isn’t pretty, but it is the truth. I’ve made killer profit and so have others... and so are you looking for mate...

Govts will end up killing any majorMAJOR crypto and digital coin. If you don’t understand monetary policy, please do some reading... If I stole your Ltc who is gonna be responsible for protecting you? 
BITCON HAS THIS ILLUSION OF TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AKA BARTER SYSTEM... CASH IS MORE ANONYMOUS...  think about it... just like cryptos... Once again think OUTSIDE THE BOX AND SEE IT IS A TRADING TREND THAT WILL BE SUB MAINSTREAM

Yeah, so worse... not only did it just create more of it, but also a new form of it non interchangeable...

I can use zelle or my cc to transfer it in seconds... not minutes or hours

What’s funny is that you are trying to get motivated by a Wall Street video... what happened to decentralization? Hahaha ideotas! Can you guys not see how Wall Street and whales are trying to manipulate the crypto markets? Sorry to brake it to you... but I see nothing but pumping recently... last year Reddit kept relatively quiet about price movements... now, everyone is trying to pump it...
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:19:20
Sorry guys, but bitcoin and all alt coins are just for trading and getting quick profits... it will never take off, because that would mean countries would seize to exist... this is so, because the only control left is monetary policy and without money the world would be in anarchy and back to the dark ages.... if bitcoin was the world currency, who will regulate when your money is stolen? Or we find that whales have the most hodled and decide to sell all of their holdings at the expense of joe and Juan the plumber?
Additionally, countries will eventually digitize their currency to prevent the former. Japan, and other countries are already testing such fin tech

It was fraud that they were doing, and then using crypto to launder and send money to Romania.... let them burn!

What’s not correct? So, you don’t think bitcoin is influenced by people who hold large amounts of it? And you don’t think if bitcoin took off, that some would hold disproportionate amounts? And if those people got together, just a few, that they could control prices like we have seen in multiple times throughout history? 
And no, I’m not Bernanke, but I am an accountant that made some money from the swings in Ltc, xlm, and vrg. I also realize that I was blinded by fomo, and that the dollar, euro, and yen will not just go away... I’m sure governments will digitize their currencies in the future, and cryptos will be like the currency you buy in apps... 
What happens when a catastrophe happens and people lose their bitcoin, or we find out coinbase has really been manipulating prices? What if the twins and a few other peeps are found to be disproportionate owners and they decide to sell and cause a panic dump sell? Will these individuals do anything about it?
Just because we hate the government with its ever reaching hands, doesn’t mean that a total annulment would be better. Thefts, fraud, embezzlement and anything else that can go wrong with paper fiat currencies, can also happen with cryptos. The difference is that who will be responsible for taking action?
Cryptos are not fixing any problems, I can send, pay, and receive with dollars faster than bitcoin or any other alt coin. 
Lastly, monetary policy stabilizes markets, or tries to at least, crypto decentralization only causes anarchy and violence (dark ages). The dollar loses value, AND GAINS it too, but you will not see it drop 65 percent of its value in days... 
I like cryptos for trading ( and you have to watch it the whole time you’re in bad you snooze and lose), but would never invest, or consider it as a mode of payment unless I want something I’m not supposed to have or want hide. But then again, I remain even more anonymous with cash!

Arbitrary creation of currency will follow all of them. That’s monetary policy part one... creation of money... inflation is creation of money until it is valued equivocally 
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:50:37
So, when there's a bust in the cryptos market, who will be responsible for protecting investors and coming up with a solution? 
That's like saying lets get rid of cops... who need them? fuck them... i hate them too, but need them to keep order... same with banks...
All economies are boom and bust... thats why the old saying "buy low, sell high"
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:45:52
Actually, the fed doesn’t print money or make laws... they enforce regulation passed by Congress. It is called the dual mandate, which comprises maximum employment and price stability. Similar to the cops..
 They don’t make the rules, they enforce them and find ways to maintain order. 
How will cryptos take over such an enormous responsibility? Decentralization = anarchy
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:32:26
This make no sense... cryptos dont equal democracy, cryptos = anarchy. So, when your cryptos get stolen or are subject to manipulation by collusion of whales, who is going to do something about it? 
There is nothing cryptos are doing that currency cant already do. My Visa can pay faster, dollar holds its value, and apps like zelle and venmo transfer money immediately... so, what is the problem cryptos are trying to fix? Isnt the point of cryptos to facilitate payments between parties? Yet, if i was to buy anything with it 1. It would take forever, 2. As i walk away the price could double up or down, and 3. Parties may not take it, bc they dont want to deal with the volatility. 
What will most likely happen is the creation of goverment backed digital currency that will be equally representative of its paper currency (both fiat).

I traded crypto, just like evryone else is doing, except the real dumbasses, ha. A quick flip should i say... in and out in two weeks... enough to see it pumped and dumped! 
Swing trading is different than investing
