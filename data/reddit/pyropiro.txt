Honest question, would Facebook be able to make enough money running a giant lightning node? They rake in billions from ads, so anything less than a billion per year in lightning fee revenues probably won't interest them.

Just delete the app and clear your data already. Keep an account to stay in touch and not miss events, but only check sparingly in your mobile browser.

Congrats! Now your next goal is to make it to the 1 million club!

Volatility should be calculated using the actual volatility finance equation. Basically the standard deviation of all daily closes for the year.

There are some tools out there, but its probably easier to delete your account and start a new one from scratch, re-adding the people you actually care about staying in touch with.

Honest question, why did you wait so long? You had literally all year to buy and you bought the top?
@_date: 2019-02-16 14:26:09
It's double what it was a few weeks ago? At this rate we could be over a billion by this time next year.

Yes I have an older account, obviously. I wanted to clear my tracks as after years of posting there was enough info to make me more identifiable. Any crypto investors should do the same from time to time.

I honestly feel very sorry for the new people that will get in once we blow through 20k. They have no fucking clue what's coming.
@_date: 2019-02-06 05:27:44
General consensus by "experts" is this year will be a boring one and we won't cross 6k this year.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:48:30
The people that bought at 9k aren't the same people that bought at 14k. Should be pretty obvious, no?

Were you not here in 2015? It was a very long and boring year with many fake outs.
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:06:53
And Russia.

Thanks just bought 100k

To secure a network of potentially over a trillion market cap in the future? That's not the kind of security I'd feel safe with.

While I'm bullish long term, you're forgetting one key fact: we've never had a multi year bull run of this magnitude before. Since we were overbought over a much longer time frame, we may remain oversold on a longer time frame too. The bear might still last most of this year, but because of next year's halvening I predict at least some major bullish action going into Q4 *latest*.

Looks like Tether is losing its peg again. How are you guys trading this? We might get a nice pump again like the last time if people panic, would be great for a short term swing trade.

Sure, I'll gladly pay $2 fees for a $3 ice cream.

Yeah, I also don't get it. If you're in the US, you can buy a Ledger and go on Coinbase. You can buy and store as much BTC as you want and the process has become very user friendly and secure.
@_date: 2019-05-02 06:57:55
Looks like we got a whale over here, everybody!

I'm sorry but this is just naive. Intrinsic value in crypto certainly does not exist, but in traditional securities its often the discounted future cash flows as a net present value, a very simple calculation.
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:16:04
That's scary. Did you manage to reset it again with the seed words?
