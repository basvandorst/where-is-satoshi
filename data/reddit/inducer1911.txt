Thanks for the explaination. I use CoinTracking.Info (CTI)'s API and on CTI, the BTC balance shows 0.077 BTC and coincidentally, 0.077 BTC matches with the one in transaction ID. So, I thought CTI captured 2.029 BTC transfer as per Coinbase (which I immediately traded on KuCoin) and shows 0.077 BTC balance since I never received it. So, I am confused and worried if i lost 0.077 BTC.
I'll take some time out to manually tally all BTC-USD purchase to find exact balance before I made GDAX-KuCoin BTC transfer. Now, I am really confused if I made 2.029 or 2.10 transfer. Thanks.

Thanks. Yes, I opened a ticket with Coinbase as soon as I noticed this. Your reply will be helpful in communicating with Coinbase now.

Here's the screenshot:  . Coinbase says −2.02931784 BTC but I am not able to find the 0.0774761 BTC balance anywhere on Coinbase and GDAX, and BTC Transaction ID: d70dbd30cd20a92426d603066aa13ccb50517488d4e71c8ad68108ba86d60200 also says that input was 2.10679394 BTC which was the amount I originally meant to transfer.
