Hey, I'll just pretend he took it from some dickhead and be fine with it.

What an amazing cause. I do feel bad for the vast amount of sob-stories you're going to have to sift through, though - and I hope the faul names they will call you won't get to you. Thank you!

Whew this attitude.

Lol calm down.. The reason that most sites are down is because they have *insane* amounts of new users.

Thank you. So say I store a password/seed word/private key inside a bank safety deposit. To send BTC I would still have to plug this into a software wallet, which could then steal my BTC, right? Surely I could do it cold and be offline, but then I can't send, can I?

This is my plan, please tell me if there are any flaws:
Make coinbase account, buy on GDAX, transfer to wallet. Wallet is a raspberry pi running ubuntu &amp; electrum. Write down half of seed in multiple papers and store at different locations (home, safety deposit, etc). 
Is this safe enough? Is ubuntu safe? Should I keep my raspberry pi offline at all times? How do I send money if my device is offline? What does it mean to run my own node?

Year ends? I could see 15k before mid-december at these rates

I'm a newcomer and figured I would ask my question here. I'm a few days away from putting in my first small investment but I need some guidance to storage. I've read the horrors of MtGox and the likes and I really dont want to "store" my coins on an exchange. I'd probably buy through GDAX or similar local alternative and then transfer to my wallet. However, what is the best solution for a "wallet"?. I know of Trezor and the likes but €90 is not a trivial amount for me and I am also incredibly afraid of straight up forgetting my password to the hardware wallet. Recommendations?

Hey, I'm a late (in short-term perspective) adopter too! I will buy for the principle. I support the idea and purpose of bitcoin - I'm not investing to make huge profits as that train has really already left for someone who doesnt have a huge capital. 
In long-term perspective however, we're both new adopters. Trust me.

Hm, I see. Do I still need to run my own node when using Trezor? Whenever I plug it into a computer does it have to be offline? How the hell does Trezor even work, can I send money with it or do I get some GUI on my computer? Also how should I store my seed? Thanks!

Does this mean I just write down my private key and put it in a safe?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:15:51
Oh no you don't

Grow some *balls* and watch it. Or dont. Its fucking disgusting

What solution do you use? Paying €90 for a hardware wallet is not trivial money for me.
