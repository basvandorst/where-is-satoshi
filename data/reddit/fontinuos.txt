the only person i told how much btc i have is a friend that is filthy rich, so i don´t think it will matter

Am I the only one that gets a little uncomfortable seeing this, thats just to much for such a short period

sold 1,5 BTC for $ 3100, 1 hour before this rise, and this only because i decided to sell it before taking a shit, otherwise i would be fine, ffs

anything over 0,5 BTC is considerable to me, i didnt mean the dip would be caused by the volume of btc i purchase, but simply  because i did purchase it, thats how it goes

that's an interesting example, but we don't really get affect constantly by those 24k transactions second, i feel it's kind established, but in the other hand things like segway, hardforks, etc, and all their particularities are changing things and making direct impact in our use of bitcoin and it's price right now... so it's good to know at least at a superficial level whats going on

except china did not ban anything (only ICO, and even that could be temporary), they did not ban exchanges, they did not ban bitcoin, they did not ban the possession of bitcoin... nothing, so they still have a bunch of fud news for the following months/years, easy money for them right ?

 I avoid talking about bitcoin with anyone, only exception is if they actually want to talk about the technology, uses, etc, but most of the time people just see it as a way to get money fast.
