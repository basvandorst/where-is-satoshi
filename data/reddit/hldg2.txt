In some ways this is an uglier drop than the drop from 12K to 6K. It's been faster and on higher volume, but on less negative news. Seems like a whale selling+some panic selling.
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:32:51
I won't reveal the real reason it bounced off 5.9k the first time, but the second bounce the day before the G20 was 100% Mark Carney's letter and Reuters' reporting of it. It was going to go lower (probably to the rising trendline at 6.6k... the same one that price bounced off of at 5.9k). But yeah, if people think the 300 day moving average matters, then it does matter.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:53:56
I've been buying this dip since $9500, but saving the bulk of it for a bigger drop. I can understand their panic. The chart is ugly AF right now and we'll probably go down to at least 8K. But it's dropping on not-so-terrible news, so it's quite likely we'll climb back up toward 10-12K before too long.

This has already happened to a large extent. Bitcoin's market cap is up from 32 to 45 percent in the last couple of months. But as long as a shitcoin like EOS sits at  in market cap ($4.6 billion) and a ton of other shitcoins push $1 billion, there's plenty of room for more money to flow into Bitcoin as the market continues to mature.
@_date: 2018-03-25 05:53:27
The "300 day MA" is a joke. In my study of stock markets and Forex it's not really even a thing. People look at the 50, 100, and 200 period moving averages on long term charts and shorter time frames on short term charts. Price randomly reacted at the 300 day MA twice for other very specific reasons both times. But when people with 2-second memory spans forget about past news, all they're left with is a chart and a meaningless line that looks like it caused the price action. That being said, even if no one cared about it before, the fact that people think it's important now is enough to make it important, especially in this ignorant market.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:45:03
I invest an amount where if it goes up I'm happy to take a moderate profit, or if it goes down I'm happy to buy the dip. I don't care either way.
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:09:38
No one is really talking about it yet, but I feel like the looming death cross is cancelling out any upward momentum right now. The smart money is selling before the panic starts. I closed half my position at 9k and wish I would have closed the other half. We're about $60 away from the death cross and the gap is closing at about $20 per day, so it's going to happen in 3-4 days. It should become the dominant theme any time now and price will slowly but steadily start making new recent lows like it did in anticipation of the G20.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:46:49
The yearly low at 5900/6000 is the next level of support. I think it will hold if we get there, but no one can say for sure.
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:13:12
You can't beat yourself up over something like this. Even if you had mined Bitcoin in 2013, it doesn't mean you would have kept at it or that you wouldn't have sold everything when price was still in triple digits. It would have required 4-5 years of discipline and making good decisions.
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:42:38
All we have now is Bitcoin getting scalped over and over between 7700-8100. The next move is far more likely to be down than up. Price isn't moving up with the death cross and tax season applying downward pressure. Maybe once the death cross hits and we find a near term bottom we can start slowly climbing back up to 9k, but there's no chance of 10k until after the filing deadline.
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:40:52
Or he could slowly buy up a million Bitcoin and then have Amazon start accepting Bitcoin and then be an even richer son of a bitch.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:57:07
Yeah, no, we're not going back to 10K before the G20 meeting. That's putting downward pressure on price even now, along with Google and Mt. Gox. We probably won't even go higher than 8.5K before the meeting. And expect another dip once regulations get discussed at the meeting and the mainstream media starts talking about how it's the end of crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:24:31
Uhh, that's because Bitcoin has been in a freefall and all the limit sell orders between $11500 and $8100 have gotten taken out along the way. It means nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:23:35
Shorting Lamborghini, going long on boar futures.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:12:26
Not daytrading. Bitcoin is a no touch until $7200 at least, and if it hits that level before the G20, I probably won't even touch it then.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:02:50
The G20 wasn't positive news. It merely alleviated some near term worries that anticipation of the meeting was causing. Positive news would have been an agreement on some benevolent regulation.
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:04:22
By all means buy into the death cross during tax season. Ill be there to buy it back at a discount later.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:42:15
This is it. Game over. Better panic sell now so I can buy the 8K dip I missed yesterday.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:28:42
Death cross right now is freaking everyone out. It's going to happen tomorrow. I would wait until it hits and people have time to panic sell a bit, then buy in.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:33:20
I think I believe you.

@_date: 2018-02-02 11:54:56
What Bitfinex does is important. That's probably the chart most people use since it's the default chart on TradingView. If it holds above 8K, then I guess that increases the odds of at least a temporary bounce.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:04:36
Pretty sure this caused Bitcoin to dip $100.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:22:46
Like on the roof? That is odd.

You probably had the "Allow Taker" option clicked. You need to use "Post Only" if you don't want to be charged a fee.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:22:37
Nah. Everyone has been saying how 8K will hold or it's the end of the world. Once 8K collapses, then we'll really see the bottom fall out. You did good getting out.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:17:01
We had the lowest level of volume in 12 days yesterday. Perhaps the fall is slowing down. The problem is the G20 meeting is Monday/Tuesday and I expect price to fall again then with just the mention of regulation. If we head into the meeting at $7000-$7500 and the news is particularly bad, that could be a problem for $6000 holding firm.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:54:55
It really is kind of funny it's going to happen tomorrow on Good Friday.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:32:49
$8050 taken down on GDAX. Boys and girls, we will have a test of $8000 tonight/this morning.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:42:28
I think so too. Bounced off the 50-day moving average and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the ATH to the 2018 low. Plus approaching the 12K level created some sell pressure. There's also a shooting star candlestick on the daily chart the day before the current drop. With no negative news, I'm buying the dip personally.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:52:47
People need to understand that Bitcoin is ultimately a currency and not an asset. It's treated like an asset right now because it's not really a currency yet, due to its wild price fluctuations, scaling problems, and potential regulation into oblivion. So there's legitimate speculation on whether or not it'll ultimately be able to perform its function as a currency, speculation on what the ultimate market cap for cryptocurrency as a whole will be, and speculation on what Bitcoin's share of that market cap will ultimately be. But then unfortunately there are also fools who call it the "gold" of cryptocurrency and think it'll have value purely as an asset and speculate on it from that perspective. I can go ahead and end that speculation for you... the ultimate value as assets of Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies combined is 0. There is and never will be a "gold" of cryptocurrency. With real gold, someone on their computer can't just go and make an alt-gold that's just like gold but only better. There's one gold. You can see it, hold it, and wear it. It has a limited supply, can't be duplicated, and has been valued for thousands of years. But with a cryptocurrency, you can make as many of them as you want and they serve the same function whether they're worth $8000 or $1 per unit. Their value will ultimately be determined by how well they perform the functions of a currency and by any potential benefits they bring over the current system.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:29:16
My understanding is it's just a committee meeting. There shouldn't even be an official statement or anything, much less regulation announced. I'll be watching though as it should be informative as to what kind of mindset Congress and regulators have toward cryptocurrency, which I don't expect to be very positive.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:44:03
Honestly it has rebounded too fast from 6K. A pretty decent correction is probably in order. I bet some whale who bought in near the bottom decided to take profit around 12K and may still be using buying pressure around 10K to close out his position. It's also likely we'll see resistance every 1K or so on the climb up where people who held on during the fall will be relieved to close out their position at break even and go and buy some safer stocks or bonds or quit investing entirely. But as long as there's no bad news, buy the dip and stop watching the price every 5 minutes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:19:10
I saw* massive buy orders too on GDAX from 8250 to 8150. They are getting ripped apart.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:28:04
This isn't even bad news. This is a good thing. Credit cards shouldn't be used for speculation. What's bad is potential Bitfinex/Tether insolvency and/or market manipulation hanging over cryptocurrency's head. China also announced that its* ban on domestic exchanges would extend to foreign exchanges, which for some reason isn't even really being talked about. Plus we don't know what the U.S. government will do in terms of regulation, but if you're betting on the leader of the world order to come in and save something that threatens the world order, I would expect to lose that bet.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:33:05
It's a strong signal that means there's indecision in the market. Look for a breakout up or down soon and then go all in if it shoots up or put everything you have in Tether if it starts going down. You can thank me later.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:03:32
Should also point out that volume today is already half of yesterday and we're only 6-7 hours in.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:14:56
Are you sure that's the same meeting? I thought it was a meeting of the Senate Banking Committee.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:34:16
There's a big push to keep this thing from crashing through 8K. A lot of whales who are heavily invested already are putting up a fight here, because they know it'll get ugly if it falls below $8000.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:08:24
I hope people aren't investing massive money in this thing due to a couple moving averages crossing. You got lucky if that worked. I hope people aren't trying to buy and HODL in this market at its current level either. That may work for people who got in at $1000, but it won't work for anyone buying right now, or at least it's not optimal. This is a bear market with Tether and potential regulation hanging over its head, and the only thing you can do is scalp, which you better be damn good at, or wait and buy on positive news. I bought at 10K the other day. I held on after the SEC announced fraud charges on an ICO, after the Tether subpoena was announced, and after Facebook announced they were banning crypto ads. But fortunately I was up in the middle of the night when India's finance minster's comments came out. The FUD was already beating the shit out of my confidence and I knew that this was the last straw and a big dip was coming, so I got out at $9850. I just wish I would have rode it back up to 9K, but it will be back around 8K in the absence of positive news, I assure you.
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:41:47
Buy out a bunch of shitcoins too and have Amazon accept them as well.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:13:15
$7200 (78.6% Fibonacci level of the 2018 high and low), $6600 (upward trendline that price bounced off of at 6K), $6000/5900 (yearly low)... could bounce off any of those levels. I think $7200 is a good place to buy some amount of cryptocurrency at, but I would say $6600 and $6000 are strong enough to catch it even if it falls below $7200... it's not do or die.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:35:44
Proof and I'll place a buy order and help him keep it above $8000. =)

@_date: 2018-02-06 02:27:56
It's not incredibly bullish on cryptocurrency... it repeats the standard cliches when it comes to blockchain, and is quite bearish when it comes to ICOs and tokens. Let's be honest. If you're going to try to buy and hodl in this market before we know whether or not Tether is solvent and if they have been manipulating the market or not, prepare to lose a good chunk of your investment.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:51:28
When I sneeze I buy, when I fart I sell. I'm up 20%.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:01:25
Technicals suggest we're going down lower. Bearish MACD and 200-day MA crossover yesterday. The climb from 6K was on the lowest volume we've seen since early 2017, while the selloff of the last 5 days has been on the highest sell volume we've seen since the start of the drop from 20K. Sorry if you're a hodler (I have a bit myself but prefer a dip to buy more), but it's gonna be another ugly day today.
