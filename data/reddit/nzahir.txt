What are the concerns? Doesnt ledger have an app to verify if anything has been tampered with

Hypothetical Question: What happens if the US comes out and bans bitcoin? How bad does its value drop? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:30:46
I had to change wallet name and refresh and it worked. But it costs 15 fucking dollars to exchange from coinbase to gatehub it looks like. Anyway to bypass these ridiculous fees?

How do I verify on coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:15:07
Just bought my very first bitcoin on coinbase(few dollars worth to test out transferring it). Paid with debit card, said it was completed in my account and I have the btc there. But it is not in my wallet so I can not send it. Why is this? Is the site slow rn or do I have to put the money into the wallet somehow?

Ah thank you so much, I refreshed multiple times but name change fixed it.
Now I have to transfer this to gatehub to purchase ripple. Do you have any experience with this

So I should do it on coinbase site and it should work automatically on gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:41:22
I am on coinbase, still cant get verified on gdax. Whats my best bet? I can just use coinbase but its like a 15 dollar fee to send my btc to bittrex

But why? Maybe I dont get it so can you explain more. If it is ILLEGAL, would people still use it? Most general businesses wouldnt take it and it has no backing behind it. Would be just like an illegal drug, its still used but there are repercussions if you get caught(info is out there to see).

Makes me show my id and then it just wont work, says too many people try again in 30 and never works. CS gave me a bs automated reply. These exchanges are so trash, need more employees and better servers

What I mean for number 2 is that say I pay someone for a shoe and they send me a different shoe to scam me. Who do I go to then? There is no third party like Paypal now to step in 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:41:23
But then the data is going through a central database? Is that not a problem? Arent people in crypto trying to get rid of 3rd parties and central data storage?

I did own some Vechain and AMB, what else is a good alt for authenticity

Does he have a newsletter and is it paid or free?

Haven't been told that there is a counterparty for risk, but I always wondered what happens when you buy off a user on a site like etsy or from IG. No protection. Unless BitPay/Coinbase figure a way out to charge very minimal fees

Why would Lunar new Year mean anything?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:20:23
Lol nobody even talks about the bond market(by far the biggest market). With rates going up they will crush stocks and cryptos

Why would Lunar new Year mean anything?
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:32:52
2 serious questions
1) If you think BTC will be worth much more in the future, why spend it?
2) How will we pay people directly, so no middle man, and trust them to send our item? What if they scam us? No protection right?
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:50:02
Ok, thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:47:03
Uhhh going down again
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:51:26
I can email you something if you want. I read john mauldin and harry dent 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:06:31
But now there is a 3rd party involved, which will want fees. So fees are still a thing unless you paying someone directly that you trust and know. Correct?
