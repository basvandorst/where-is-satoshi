It is free to send or receive money from bank accounts and to or from credit/debit cards, free to deposit cash to your bank account next day - or instantly for a fee. 
For BTC exchanges their website says this:
“You are not charged a conversion fee, or any other fees, to buy or sell Bitcoin through the Cash App.”
And this: 
“Your exchange rate for buying and selling Bitcoin through the Cash App is calculated using the current market rate across the most popular U.S. exchanges, plus a spread determined by the size of your transaction and market volatility. The exchange rate may differ between transactions, and may also differ from exchange rates available to you from other buyers and sellers of Bitcoin.”
As I understand it they make money on the spread from your BTC buys/sells and also make money on interest earned on the cash that users hold in their accounts just like any bank. 
Edit: you can’t upload a logo, only draw with a pen and use a few select line art logos and letters/numbers. Like the praying hands in the first image.

Lol I appreciate the advice, did I mistakenly share my private keys here? If not maybe I should have for inadvertently becoming a VISA shill. Shame on me! Bad interneter! 
Edit: the keys warning is crucial, I too wish more people understood the risk of storing BTC and other cryptos in “wallets” like Coinbase and Square Cash. Maybe more people would receive and internalize this  if one wasn’t an utter butthole when sharing it. :)

It’s funny if you look at some of these un-bank debit and credit card solutions a lot of them are black, one that comes to mind is Plastc Card. 
Clearly it’s to capitalize on just what you said, us mere mortals are enamored with the idea of the classic black American Express Centurion card. There are some excellent stories telling of the lengths that Amex Concierge will go to for its VIP black card customers.

Don’t quote me on this but it looks like at this time you can only Buy and Sell (to or from Square) and send BTC to an external wallet address from within the app. I don’t see any way to access your Square wallet address in app, but I’m also not looking that hard.

We have - in no particular order:
• the classic 3-dimensional square. Incredible. 
• the genius utterances of a poet known only as Little Pump. 
• a scratched out wiener 
• one of Drakes album covers (no love for Drake but this one I’m proud of lol)
• the symbol that proves you’re 2 cool 4 school
• and two track maps for my motorsports fans.

Mail me your phone and I’ll draw a debit card masterpiece in the app just for you. Then I’ll probably mail your phone back.

I’m actually ordering one right now, last time I used Square Cash it was just a lame Venmo competitor, but this all seems to be a fairly impressive package for alternative banking.

Another commenter asked if BTC could be sent to your Square/Cash App wallet, and as far as I know you cannot. My guess is that this is to dissuade the possibility of tax evasion by transferring BTC into Square/Cash App from various unregulated exchanges and then cashing out on their exchange to your bank account. I may be wrong. 
There is the possibility of arbitrage in one direction - buy in Cash App, transfer to Exchange X wallet, sell on Exchange X for profit - but the likelyhood of finding an exchange with a meaningful spread that you’d be able to sell into USD or USDT is very small lol.
