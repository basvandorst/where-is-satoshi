Wow, you people really hate dogecoin.

I like dogecoin, and I laughed, not even going to fib.

It is no secret how bits feels about doge, I thought it was funny too though.

We should call this the Bieber constant.
 Where someone or a group hates something so much, it starts to become an obsession that resembles dysfunctional love.

If the people at dogecoin tip people they are angry with (as seen throughout this thread), I'm ok with this anger.

Thanks for the source. My $100 figure admittedly was from not the latest and greatest from them.
Also your $245 model retails @ $750 well over 100% profit. You're subsidizing them, not the other way round. They are overpriced in many peoples eyes and despite hate I might get the model you listed is what I have in my pocket.

R&amp;D is extremely cheap when you split that cost among tens of millions of devices
I see what you're trying to say; still phones are objectively and subjectively over priced.

false. a new iPhone is only $100 to make. They aren't subsidizing so much as ripping you because that's what people will pay. 
I'm sure the pyra is more than $100 to manufacture though.
