Getting my coin off Coinbase and putting them in Trezor (along with a small subset in Gemini) felt nearly as good as getting rid of my cable box.
I used to really like Coinbase, but after that Bcash insider trading charade I couldn't keep my funds there in good conscience.

I am pro bitcoin. I own and believe in bitcoin. However, I readily admit that although I probably know more than the average person, I make claims to be an expert understanding the underlying technology. 
With the analogy your making... isn’t this just duplicating the mistakes made with fiat? First we trade gold, then locking up the gold and issuing gold certificates, aka money. Then that money becoming so separated from the gold backing it becomes worthless fiat?
Please tell me we’re not reproducing the same mistakes with bitcoin that we made with fiat.

I used to think that. Then I read this post:
  
I work in a field where people tell stories. Some truthful, many fake. And its port of my job to separate fact from fiction. After awhile you begin to develop a keen sense of someone's "truthfulness". I may not be right all the time, but after reading that post I would bet the mortgage that that post is almost 100% truthful.

Anyone looking at that page - even non crypto savy people - should be able to tell within an instant that its loaded with spammy, click-bait articles, with negative toned headlines and stinks of someone pushing an ulterior motive. “A Tale of Two Bitcoins”,  “Official” Bitcoin Twitter Account Deems Bitcoin Cash to be the Superior Version". My BS detector flies off the radar even if I know nothing about this debate.

To me this is the strongest argument against the long term success of bitcoin - the simple fact that its a "first mover". The idea that the first iteration of something rarely remains the leader is a concept that goes far beyond just technology. Its a widely accepted concept even in such things as [human migration patterns]( where the first peoples to inhabit an area are rarely the first long term inhabitants. Its actually quite amazing that bitcoin is still the crypto leader given the advancement in technology since its inception and the shear number of copycat currencies. If Bitcoin remains King, and I certainly hope it does, it'll be quite an amazing feat of success.

Yesterday I transferred all my BTC and ETH from Coinbase to Gemini. I was a real shame because to be hones I really liked the Coinbase app and the website design. It was well laid out, easy to read, and the app had a pin lock.
But after the shadiness of last week I just couldn't in good conscience use them anymore. I keep my holdings in Gimini now.

After 1-2 months of effort, I was FINALLY able to claim my bch using the 12 word seed from my iOS mycelium.  (Yay to buying more btc!) Mycelium is an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet which complicated the process from a non-HD wallet. Overall it was a frustrating experience but the ultimate solution was fairly straight forward. If anyone needs help feel free to PM me.

This is far from "proof". Every 24 hour news cycle will contain some positive and negative blurb regarding bitcoin. It is neither constructive nor reasonable to assume market manipulation to the types of dips and gains which we have been seeing all year long.
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:27:30
Ive never thought the safe deposit box and storing bitcoin with a service was a fair comparison. A safety deposit box holds and secures material possessions that are valuable. Users are a least allowed to enter the safety deposit box area and get a sense of the physical security of the place. 
Bitcoin occupies no material or physical space. And so long as only the user knows the 12(24) word key, they will always be secure. So why pay someone to hold your bitcoin for you? Especially when we have no real sense of the systems that keep it secure and whether they are vulnerable to hacking. I suppose the only use case I can see the safety deposit box being applicable is if the user just had no faith in themselves to keep the key secure.

Venmo is useless? I feel like its probably one of the most useful apps I have. Amongst my friends whenever we go out for dinner or on a trip we just Venmo each other what we owe. Takes 2 seconds. How is this useless?

I understand that as a business there is risk to accepting a currency with as much volatility as bitcoin. But I really I wish I ran a business because I would do everything within my means to accept it. It breaks my heart that more businesses don’t. The door is begging to be broken open.

I just dont understand why they are SOOOOO obsessed about being called the real "bitcoin". I own btc and bch, I would be a proud member of both communities, but they are just so hell bent on being called the real bitcoin instead of bitcoin cash that I just cant even get past it. If they just embrace their name than Ill be happy to coexist with bch. But so long as their sole mission is stealing the bitcoin name than I'm out.

I’m really confused why you would say that, or how I managed to project that perception thru my comment. Maybe I didn’t word it well, but I just don’t think the safety deposit box analogy justifies or really even applies to leaving your bitcoin in exchanges. Bank account maybe, safety deposit box, no. 
Regardless, I promise you I live in no compound.

I understand Paypal owns Venmo. But it seems that PayPal the site/app whatever is more suited for the business/customer relationship model. I've done VERY few P2P payments with PayPal. Venmo literally just lists my contact, I click the right one, and send the money. It's what I wish bitcoin would become and if more of my friends would jump on the bitcoin bandwagon that's how I would want to use it.

I have a newbie question that I hope someone can answer for me... So I have a few different BTC wallets (mobile wallet, Trezor and Coinbase account). Regardless of which wallet Im using, the wallet always provides me a different address when I need to provide an address to someone else so they can send me bitcoin. So aren't my funds actually dispersed across many addresses? And wouldn't this also be true for the 94,000 BTC in the wallet mentioned in this article?

That is my biggest concern about bitcoin and honestly seeing that info graphic of world wide power usage for bitcoin being higher than 150(?) countries shook me to my core. I had no idea about that.

@_date: 2017-11-01 15:10:19
I completely agree. When I advise my friends to consider investing in bitcoin the simple fact that I have to say its $6k per coin is an immediate turn off to them. It doesnt matter that I tell them its divisible, and that its not the value of "a coin" that matters but rather just a sum of money to invest. The simple fact they get less than 1 coin for $6k is indeed a  psychological barrier.

I am not an expert so this question may not make much sense so perhaps someone can elighten me. The articles states that "There are two main vectors of attack possible for quantum computers.":
1) The computer is able to deduce the private key of an address only by seeing its public key, which is usually used for transacting on the network.
2) Overtaking control of the whole network through the sheer speed of computation and attaining at least 51 percent of the network’s hash rate.
But what about brute force? Apparently all bitcoin addresses can be encoded in a 12 word seed phrase. I understand that that is too many possibilities for a modern computer to calculate in any feasible amount of time, but what about quantum computers?
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:30:00

I just remember using some wallet software to restore funds. I entered the 12 word and boom all of a sudden I had my funds populated into my wallet. 
It seemed a little prone to someone who had a quantum supercomputer to just keep brute forcing combos and swiping any bitcoins from any valid addresses along the way. This doesn’t require knowledge of any public key pairing.

Why do people think sending emails to politicians or regulatory bodies matters? It does not. No one reads them. Ok maybe 1 or 2 get read but again, but emails aren't convincing anyone of anything.
