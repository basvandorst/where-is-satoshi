Control over the coin is not what makes crypto unregulated. Most crypto exchanges are self-regulated. Some don’t allow you to dump and some won’t allow you to create a sell wall that is 15% above the market 24 hour high or 15% above the highest sell bid. We are doing good without the regulation. 
The only protection we need is insider trading and the government can’t stop that either. We have to have good morals to protect us from it and we have already seen Coinbase publicly state their positions snd have taken proactive steps to prevent it.

LOL. 
Don’t get mad at the market. Let me give you a piece of advice:

You pay to have your results listed in rank. People pay for keywords. In this case, google blocks all ads and stops the competition. 
Google dominates the online space for advertising much more than Microsoft or yahoo.

The reason the price isn’t going up is because a bunch of sharks entered the market. You also have a bunch of FUD that was created by the mass media and mainly people from Wall Street who either A) View Crypto as a serious threat or B) They themselves are now invested in crypto and had to FUD so they can buy in low before they sell high. 
This is the reason why the market continues to go down. However, many people firmly believe it will go up. Hence the reason Goldman-Sachs created a trading desk simply for crypto and many other businesses now starting to accept it. 
It’s also noteworthy to mention that the low price helps mass adoption. We are all deeply involved in crypto but the majority of the world isn’t yet on board. It will be a slow and steady pace before things sky rocket in our opinions. 
I hope this helps.

It doesn’t matter what you say or I say, because a precedent has already been set. Google has been sued for doing exactly this in the past.

Is the guy mining Sia coin also going to mention the alleged scams and collusion between Bitmain and Sia to dump the price ? Is he going to mention how the ceo lost over 2 million dollars worth of Sia froma company wallet and how he openly admitted that SiaCoin investors who are losing money outweigh those who are happy about the tech? 
Can you imagine if Bill Gates told his early investors to STFU about his stocks because other people who invested are just ecstatic about Microsoft?

You guys know if everyone just starts setting their price at the bracket they believe it will reach it will reverse the bear trend? Imagine if everyday everyone who holds bitcoin starts putting sell bids at their price. Let’s say $47,000 as the guy mentioned. 
The order book gets filled with $47,000 sell bids and if enough of them are placed that becomes the new price and someone is bound to begin buying. It will inch to it closely. 
I personally believe it will reach $320,000 and that’s where all my bitcoins are placed at.

Lol good one. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:58:35
Lmao. The way you put it is exactly how all the retards in the market react to FUD and they don’t know Wall Street is actually buying them up!!

How much do you guys want to bet this IMF Chief has buttloads of BTC and wants to FUD so they can buy more ?
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:36:48
You completely misunderstood. 
The market is down because people are selling low. To reverse the trend the sell orders in the exchanges have to go up. everyone starts selling at their own rate instead of allowing the people dumping to control the market once enough orders are in and someone buys at a higher rate then it begins climbing again.

I hope everyone realizes that chart is for a pump and dump and not actual stocks. Imagine if that chart applied to every stock or crypto on the market? 
Most cryptocurrencies will rise to their true value after this bear run.

They have been sued for refusing to run ads and in a separate case for having a monopoly on search results. You don’t know what you’re talking about.

It’s getting bad for people because they used fiat and still rely on fiat for a living. You can’t blame everyone for selling. I can blame all the people holding. If they wanted the price to go up it’s very simple, place all your tokens at your price. 
Let’s use a hypothetical situation. Everyone says it won’t work but it does and will. 
Let’s say there are levels of people selling and each level has tens of thousands of bitcoin owners. All each person has to do is name his price and the order book fills up and reverses the trend. 
So you will have a wave of various people selling above what the current market was and all the sharks who are dumping waiting to buy back in will get fucked hard. 
I’ve had mine at $320,000 I’m first in line when it finally reaches that price. Everyone else can sit back or be proactive and sell it at the price they believe it will reach.

Those who said bitcoin would reach 20k in December also said it would reach between 30-100k by April. 
Do I take this with a grain of salt?
Maybe these predictions are another edge of the sword. One group promotes the price to slice it up and the other FUD to chop it down. 
I don’t know why everyone still “waits” for the market to determine price. There are whales out there. How about naming your own price? As for me I have a sell order waiting at $320,000 per bitcoin. All people have to do to reverse the bear trend is start selling at the high prices they choose.

They’ve been sued in the past for favoring google owned companies being placed at the top for google searches above others. This would fall under anticompetitive laws. There’s a huge conflict of interest.

If the ledger is designed to be public then everything would be in open view. It wouldn’t be your typical ledger with addresses. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:16:12
We are talking about a ledger which is used by the government that’s open to the public. We aren’t talking about a ledger that has our names and salaries on it. 
It can be coded in a way that shows pay out to companies or payments from people to the government like taxes or fines and vice versa. This way no backdoor deals can happen, unless they begin using silver and gold as cash. But even those purchases can now be more readily tracked than cash. 
I think it’s a step in the right direction and all the kinks can be worked out.
