This is where services like TenX enter the scene.  
You pay with a normal credit card but in the background they calculate which of your cryptos is the best to pay with right now and do the rest for you.  
Trying to use bitcoin directly is like running around with a bar of gold and complaining about how hard it is to get it into portions to pay with.  
We need companies like TenX to get the attention they deserve because they are the ones making cryptocurrencies work in every day life.

Dunno where you read that. That's not what I said.  
The rising value of Bitcoin for every-day use is undeniable, tho. If you want to ignore it, I'm cool with that.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:34:31
So you're saying just because it evolved, we should keep it? Fuck that. There should be no other option than to replace this inhuman financial system that's built on abuse, exploitation and terror.  
Bitcoin is not perfect but it is the best fucking chance to create something better right now. And anything better than people dying on the other end of the world for my spoils is worth a fucking shot.  
  
By using a system you make yourself responsible for how it affects the world.

Countries and banks paving the way for Bitcoin adoption. You can read about this literally every week if you're looking for it and they are not doing this based on speculation but because the demand is there (and ofc to prepare to get a piece of the cake when things really take off. Trust the greed of the big fishes).  
Companies like TenX, technologies like Lightning Network already making BTC a more reliable and trustworthy option for every-day transactions than fiat.  
Seeing how it already worked on a big scale e.g. in Greece or Africa.  
Every news, every picture about how people find more usage for their Coins both spending and earning them.  
More and more personal and shared experiences with every-day use of BTC.  
  
Those are just some of the indicators I trust more than any deceiving stat or number because they actually come from the real world and are impossible to be manipulated or misinterpreted.  
Oh talking of that - the fact that the price is being manipulated big-time for months now may just be the biggest hint that someone is mighty scared to lose his power.  
  
(I will add my personal most valuable reason to this, think of it what you want:  
BTC is the far more human option to our current money system. Everyone who digs into how banks run the world should be horrified and on his way out as fast as he can. Awareness about this is on the rise, as well as frustration about our current financial system and will eventually lead to people taking responsibility and looking for alternatives. And BTC is the best, real and most advanced right now)  
  
Excuse me if I'm coming off rude, I am not trying to be, I respect you digging deeper.

Excuse me, I didn't know we had a time traveller from the future here. I take it all back then. Surrender to the banks!  
I guess in the future you also saw me edit my post saying "btw I only hoard and never spend Bitcoin and me talking about real-world usage is purely theoretical"  
Oh, well, what can you do... I also liked the part where you knew better than me why I own Bitcoin, that was fun.
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:55:54
Every currency, every trading system is purely based on consent.  
Who said Gold is worth anything? What is the worth of gold? Why should I care about this piece of paper with numbers on it? Why should it be worth more than a slice of bread?  
  
Simply because we agree on it to be.  
But now people are beginning to take responsibilty for the systems they live in. And the banking system we depend on right now is a giant nature and humanity abusing monster.  
Time to replace it with something that suits us better.

That graph doesn't say anything because it includes all day-trading and speculative transactions. Those are not what I mean with real-world usage and is exactly what I was talking about when I said price =/= value.
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:08:19
If that's true, you might've lost me then.  
Shit happens. Have a nice day, man.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:54:50
Don't worry I'm just having fun, if you see where the attacks are coming from, you notice they're not aimed at you ;)  
Appreciate your words, warrior. Stay warm!
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:44:25
In the long run, definitely. At this moment it is even more eco-friendly to get out of our dependency on banks who are making a living out of war and fossil fuels ASAFKNP.

Can't disagree on any of this but I just think it is part of the learning process we undergo as a global culture. Crypto-currencies are historically totally new to human society with an unmeasurable potencial. This mixture is BOUND to cause a whole ton of misunderstanding, abuse, failure, resistance and struggle over controlling it.  
I believe that it is not our job to keep people from getting scammed or making mistakes in general. We need those to learn and adapt. People need time to learn how to make reasonable decisions regarding such a new technology.  
The lesson with all the ICO scam is not "crypto-currencies are bad" but "don't make unreasonable decisions". People will get that in the end but unlike someone who's really diving into the topic they might need more time, more mistakes and more positive examples to look up to.  
They might be scared off for months or years but in the mean-time the technology will advance and spread, smart people will create smart ways to make cryptos easy-to-use and it will not be long until they get in contact with the topic again. This time with less traps to step into.  
  
Sometimes the most influencial thing you can do is to just forget about everyone who doesn't get it at the moment. Keep diving in for yourself, keep thinking and sharing thoughts with people who are open for discussion but don't waste your time on people who are not ready for it.  
They have to get to that point themselves and your time and attention is way better spent on leading by example because that is exactly what most people need to actually gain the courage to dive into new fields.  
  
Hope that didn't get too superficial - I am doing my best over here to try and dive into the core of things as a non-native speaker :P

Correct, thank you!

nice ad.

I am shifting my attention to other things now but you're right about the quoting thing regarding, let me just say, "reddit mechanics".  
I will invest some time into learning how to format better as I don't actually know how to do it right now, because I see your point and I noticed myself that it makes discussions more accessible.
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:00:51
Valid point but even those are still raising the attention. Adoption and exchange rates are not the only indicators of Bitcoin's value, attention to the topic imho is just as important. Even if it's misunderstanding.  
No such thing as bad publicity.  
A lot of people now, maybe for the first time in their life, actually start to think about how the world is run and what financial system they're depending on.
