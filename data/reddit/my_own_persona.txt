I like XVG to be honest, the others coins he has tweeted about suck though

I plan on waiting another hour and then buying, imo we are seeing the big 3 drop and pumping into BCASH so they can sell it today. I think the big 3 will shoot WAY  up this afternoon

I mean they're not the moron who's claiming bitcoin is only valuable as a currency lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:01:11

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:49:01
I thought the dip was 16,600 and bought more smh
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:55:36
every single post you've made is bitcoin FUD, you're an embarrassment 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:50:39
another new account, another pathetic FUD post

First mover's advantage allows bitcoin to stiil dominate as gold 2.0 giving it plenty of time for the lightning network to come out

If he buys one fourth of a bitcoin he will be a millionaire in 15 years
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:58:17
I see you already have the pompous ass part of being a multi millionaire down :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:14:07
Can you ELI5 why it would take a big drop though? Besides a fork?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:28:55
Why do you think it will drop that much?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:06:04
bitistamp looks like a good one to try, thanks!

So your feelings are hurt because someone had a different opinion? His logical thread was well needed to counteract all of these threads convincing everyone that they will be rich and the price will never fall
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:37:35
Makes a lot of sense, thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:43:00
Where do you see that option? All I have is a option in the upper right to turn on the flash
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:25:43
don't cry because you don't have sources :(
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:03:27
uhh no, on GDAX you don't have to pay anything to transfer bitcoin to a wallet
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:22:36
What is it
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:35:58
what are your thoughts on that?
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:29:05
do you think it will last a few more days
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:44:47
what is that
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:48:06

@_date: 2017-10-24 18:44:31

@_date: 2017-10-24 02:18:42
I'm currently screaming because my piece of s*** Bank things coinbase is fraudulent again and won't let me make a f****** purchase this bank and go f*** themselves I'm transferring as soon as possible Jesus Christ
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:18:00
it won't register for some reason it keeps saying "please enter a valid account number" it does the same thing to me as well
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:18:44
Friday's seem to be the worst day of the week to buy Bitcoin as well as it always spikes
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:25:55
No way that happens with the Nov fork 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:40:11
My bank blocked the transaction from earlier today I tried to make so I'm pretty angry right now and will be switching to a established bank as soon as possible
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:28:34
I would wait till tomorrow afternoon to be honest with you Fridays are always the biggest Spike of the week and it seems to drop a little bit but if it doesn't tomorrow afternoon I would still buy
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:22:28
What do you mean? Did you use your bank account it should buy at the price you clicked on at the time
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:02:13
lol at your username
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:59:30
dump her after you cash in in 5 years
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:28:03
I think mine is just a matter of how small it is, I live in rural Minnesota so I use or did use a small chain that only has three total Banks all in Minnesota. I need to hit one of those name brand Banks up ASAP
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:59:08
I am definitely going to do that eventually unfortunately my current bank is very small and coinbase won't even recognize it using the other options so I have to use card at least for the next week
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:42:53
What does that have to do with anything, sounds like you just wanted to post to be a douche
