I don’t have the time to sum up how terrible this analogy is.

If you get this bothered by someone disagreeing with your viewpoint, perhaps you’re too fragile to be investing in crypto...

Do I seem to be emotionally invested? I just think it will. And when a large proportion of investors are wrong about something, that’s often where opportunity lies.
I find it an interesting topic regardless.

Ladies and gentleman, exhibit one on why Bitcoin became the biggest bubble we’ve seen in generations
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:56:12
The problem is Bitcoin hasn’t transformed anything? A crypto may work in future, but it won’t be Bitcoin. 
People who don’t understand the technology got sucked into one of the largest bubbles we’ve ever seen. It’s not slowly deflating.

Not all opinions are equal. Granted, I may be wrong. But we’re talking about gaping, blindingly obvious issues with the technology that make it unfit for its ultimate purpose. 
Maybe I am wrong, but it’s a lot likelier you are.

I have interest, I think there will be opportunities to make money on it too. But the money is to be made from the almost religious belief in Bitcoin from people that don’t understand its significant shortcomings. 
When people are panic selling I would consider buying at the right levels. 
I don’t hate Bitcoin at all. A crypto will be a part of the future landscape. It almost certainly won’t be Bitcoin without drastic changes.

I’m not invested, so it doesn’t matter if I do or not.
From what I do know it seems completely unviable though.

Oh the irony. Someone clearly doesn’t have a clue.

The problem is Bitcoin needs to change drastically to survive. It’s highly inefficient. Perhaps it does evolve into something workable, but that’s not Bitcoin in its current guise

I may be wrong, not claiming to be smarter than anyone.
You seem so much more emotional than a lot of people though.
