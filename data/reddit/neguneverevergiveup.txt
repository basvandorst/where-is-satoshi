Hey Atheose, thanks for replying so quickly! Thanks to everybody for up-voting and showing your support. We at NEGU want to thank all of you!
When it comes to giving proof that this address will go towards charity, the fact that no transactions have been done yet can hinder our ability to prove anything. However, due to the public blockchain, anybody can track our address, and what we use it for, through the URL 
We want to ensure that we get something across. Something that I missed out in the original post I made was that we have decided to allow people to get merchandise through this, as well. If you wish to get your merchandise from a Bitcoin transaction, all I will require is a screenshot of your transaction logs, giving proof you donated. If you can send those to my email, eilberkim then I can process it. 
If you have any other questions, feel free to shoot me a email at eilberkim If you are doing so, can you make sure you put [NEGU] in the topic, as I get quite a few emails per day, and this can help me to filter them better!
Thanks everybody who has up-voted, posted, donated or even looked at this page, you have no idea how much one donation can help a kid in need.

I actually cannot access the twitter account, only Erik Rees (Chairman) and Jeff Gibson (Public Policy) can access it. If this means you cannot trust us, then fair enough, but I can assure you this is not a scam. 
It disheartens us that such things do happen where people do fake charity. However, due to the fact that we have children's photographs up on there, due to legal reasons (Photo Waiver) I cannot access the account, and every post we send out means we have to hire our lawyers for so much longer, and that could not be financially sensible.
