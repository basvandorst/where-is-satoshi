Unless the winning bid(s) are above market value, why would the value of bitcoins increase? And, why would anyone bid more than the market value?

Make it rain in this particular direction!

I'm assuming the reason why the price has increased ~$50 in a day is because of this auction. But, shouldn't this decrease the price of bitcoins? How is this good news?!?

Not sure what the game developer thought by not capping the offline earnings.  I'm up to 150% in offline earnings for the Time Machine.

Thanks so much. That makes sense.

"In 10 years, we'll probably have a hyper train, electric self-driving cars, and we'll probably put a human on Mars. By then, do you think we'll be using paper money and metallic coins to represent value and currency?"

I created this quick jquery plugin which dynamically converts BTC to USD.
Instead of writing *"In May, John sold 100 bitcoins which had a value of $100,000 at the time"*... bloggers can now write *"In May, John sold 100 bitcoins, which has a current value of &lt;span data-bitcoin-value=100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"*.  
The plugin will hit MtGox, get the current rate, calculate the amount, and then inject it into the sentence.

You mentioned that the value of existing coins will increase as people lose their coins.  In order for this to happen, we'll need to somehow differenciate a lost coin vs. an inactive coin. How can we do that in order for the value of bitcoins to increase?
Or, maybe the amount of total bitcoins in existence isn't what we should target. Maybe we should be looking at the total active bitcoins?

That makes sense. But how will we know when coins are "lost"? What's the difference between me losing my paper wallet containing 5 bitcoins and my friend saving a 5 bitcoin paper wallet for his child's 18 year old birthday?
