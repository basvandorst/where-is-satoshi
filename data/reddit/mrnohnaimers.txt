Cost to wire? $20 is pretty normal and with more "premium" bank accounts it's usually free.

probably no, whatever chinese company that contracted Samsung to do the fab work most likely designed and own the design to the chip. Same thing with Bitmain &amp; TSMC, Bitmain designed and own the design to the chip that's why you don't have a ton of different ASICs from different companies with almost identical performance.

Right...... people should only post about Bitcoin going up to 30K, 40K, 50K, 100K etc.... Those posts are really helpful.

Exactly you should point out the negatives about Bitcoin as well. With a bank account, if your account get hacked and somebody stole all your $$ at least in the US you are not liable for such a loss if you notify the bank within 60 days. Same with credit cards, you are not responsible for any fradulent transaction.
Also it's inaccurate to say just because Bitcoins are limited to 21 million it'll "increases in value over time." Yes Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but there are no limits to how many times people can fork Bitcoin and create Bitcoin like cryptocurrencies and no limits to how many different non-Bitcoin related cryptocurrencies people can create. The supply of cryptocurrencies are virtually unlimited.

I guess it really does depend on the profession. I got paid about $50 per hour for the internship I had while getting my MBA about 5 years ago

What insane fees to the banks? Majority of checking &amp; savings account have no fees if you can meet their very reasonable minimum balance. Other than those "payday loans" the interest rates for mortgages and loans are very reaonsable when taking each individual's credit history into consideration. 
Yes there are countries with poorly managed economy &amp; incompetent monetary policies, however those countries represent a teeny tiny small percentage of the global economy &amp; wealth.

Only a tiny minority of merchants offer discount for cash transactions, so I doubt you'll see large # of merchants offering discounts for crypto.

To satisfy the need of having a scapegoat to take the blame for the recent crash?

Simple my ass. If the only way to buy &amp; sell a certain asset is by using an illegal method (by Chinese law at least), what % of the population do you think will be comfortable doing so? and do you think a significant % of the population are willing to allocate a significant % of their asset to crypto given the severe restrictions?
