I have one Sapphire 5870, 1GB that I'll sell.
I bought it brand new, in the box in early July. I've been using it to mine, but I never overclocked the core. I did underclock the memory, however. I still have the actual box, but I lost the cardboard innards.
Make me an offer (with shipping cost in mind). I'll take BTC.
Edit: Saw you don't want to use BTC. I can take Dwolla aswell.

They're not even anywhere close to 100% of the market. Maybe you meant oligopoly, but even that wouldn't apply. Give me your subjective term of monopoly then, so we can have a discussion on the same terms.
The thing is, I can name ACTUAL monopolies (that is, groups which are the one and only supplier of a product/service) in our regulated economy. And I don't have to change the definition to name them.

MTGOX is not a monopoly; there are many other exchanges, not to mention a few coins besides bitcoin now. If anything, this shows that monopolies can only exist in a regulated market, because I can name many, many monopolies in our highly regulated economy, but cannot name one directly related to bitcoin.

I like the idea of a p2p exchange without a central hub... If an entire currency can be made p2p, surely an exchange could be aswell.

Can't imagine what happening? There's a lot going on in that chart. What are you even refering to?

If you can't imagine bitcoins going to 58 cents per coin, then you should be in cash? I would think you would want to be in bitcoins if you can't imagine it going that low.
Or are you saying that if you can't comprehend the possibility, then you shouldn't participate in the bitcoin economy?
I can't tell if you're trying to scare people out of bitcoin, trying to keep people realistic in their speculative investments, or just making a speculative prediction yourself. I think some clarification is needed...

Alright, I was just trying to figure out if you were a troll bent on seeing bitcoin fail, so making a prediction that it'd be 50 cents soon... In which case I would have invited you to short-sell, for my amusement. 
But if you're just pointing out that the possibility exists to people who might be trading without risk in mind, I can't fault that.
