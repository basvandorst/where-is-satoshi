I personally use bitcoin to transfer money anywhere in the world, more or less instantly, at neglible cost. I have business associates in lots of places (China and the Uk, just as examples), and the only alternative to bitcoin is paypal. As any paypal user knows, every day is a gamble on whether or not your account gets frozen, or somebody charges back and you lose your product, and the payment. In fact, it's possible for people to pay you money, charge back instantly, claim their account was stolen, and put your money at risk. Additionally, for overseas transactions Paypal charges very high fees, which make it unsavory. With bitcoin, I can instantly and for free send money anywhere in the world, and once I have it, it's mine, and no big faceless corporation can steal my money in a fit of corporate incompetence.
fuck paypal, use bitcoin
