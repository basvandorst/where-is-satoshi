I think tipping should focus on people who actually need a tip or warrant a tip.  Throwing tips around for no good reason is really more like a spam button for the internet.  Tip people who make things, people who contribute to discussions, people who produce content, and charitable organizations of course.

One:  Screw Ripple.
Two:  It's been trading on its own market pair on crypsty for a little more than a month.  This provides incentive to buy ripple, to trade for other coins, and attempt to manipulate even smaller markets.  If this proves to be anything like what happened to prime coin (XPM), we will see a return to normalcy within the next few months.

The laptop runs the program offline that generates the paper wallets, ie the public and private keys.  The laptop does not store any information about the paper wallets.  There is an option to copy the private keys, but I would not recommend copying them to a laptop, I would copy them to a USB if I wanted a secondary copy of my paper wallets.  The paper wallets exist as an address on the blockchain, so after they are printed the laptop no longer has anything to do with them. Best of luck with Bitcoin security, it takes a little bit of patience and research, but it pays off with knowing that your bitcoins are secure.

Gox was already low on cash, remember the US govt froze their bank accounts.  One theory about why Gox prices were always higher than everyone else, is that they lost a great deal of fiat or btc at some point and were charging premium rates to attempt to recover this loss.  The price has already started to detach itself from gox.  We will see a period of turmoil before a return to normalcy, followed by a large increase in price.

Unfortunately, Changetip does not use BTC as a means of sending their micropayments (tips) around.  This is simply not feasible in the blockchain due to the miners fees.  They instead hold the amount of fiat that you were tipped and payout in BTC.  But, Yes, BTC for the win!!!

What I would like to see is a well thought out, direct response to these criticisms.  Changetip needs to be open and honest about their intentions.  The Bitcoin community is concerned about privacy, and the policies that govern our sensitive data.  I'm pretty sure I saw a couple posts from the changetip founder about their policies on here a while back, so he is a redditor.  I'll see if I can find them.  
Edit: Found one.But can't seem to find anymore.  Didn't they have someone else doing reddit marketing recently?

I heard that Changetip was invited to defend themselves live on World Crypto Network **two weeks ago**.  They declined.  It seems they couldn't handle a live interview and had to instead call one of their cronies at Coindesk.  I keep telling people, "Changetip is a great idea...just like MySpace."

Good point.  I heard one comment that referred to Bitcoin as the currency of Bitpay.
We need to focus on the fact that it works, and not how it works.  People get caught up in the technical explanations of Bitcoin and that's when it becomes over-complicated.  I don't know all of the technical aspects of how my credit card works, I just know that it works.  That's what's important here, Bitcoin works, and it works better than legacy banking systems.

The use of custom monikers is fun but very problematic in this way.  This just further illustrates the problem with a centralized service for tipping.  Also the problem of tipping in comments.  When I tip a waiter/waitress in a restaurant, I don't publicly announce "I would like to tip this waiter/waitress 15 dollars" and then have that fulfilled by a third party.  Nope, I pay them directly.  Tipping needs to be a direct action, or it loses it's desired effect.
