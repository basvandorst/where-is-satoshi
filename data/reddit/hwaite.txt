I'm confused. Given that anyone can create unlimited number of addresses, how is the government supposed to effectively blacklist them? Why would ['black market', international] lightening networks honor a government blacklist in the first place? How many distinct lightening networks are you anticipating in order to facilitate this nightmare 'centralization' scenario? Even if LN doesn't pan out, how are we any worse off than before? What's to stop Bitcoin Core from going back to the drawing board?
I agree that Core precipitated this pointless BTC/BCH schism. They could've easily increased block size as a stopgap solution. Nevertheless, it's not clear to me that (a) LN can't work or (b) some superior solution can't be adopted in the future.

Unless *all* LN networks are regulated and tracked, how can a central authority prevent BTC from being laundered into a 'clean' address? Or are you suggesting that every single lightening network will be compromised? As I understand it, the cost of opening a channel is low enough that there will be more of them than could feasibly be controlled by set of captured institutions. If tainted money 'infects' all addresses on a mid-sized node, blacklists become unenforceable.

Heh, spoken like a true libertaribitcoiner.






'Wrong' is a subjective, man-made construct. No two people will agree on every moral dilemma. I could just as easily say that it's wrong not to take money by force if it's for the greater good. It's pointless to argue since there's no objectively correct definition. What I can confidently assert is that a society with zero taxes is completely impractical.








I'm referring to aggregate quality of life. The point is that benefits to the recipients outweigh the cost to the donors.






Diminishing marginal utility is an intuitive concept and there is no serious opposition to it among economists of all persuasions. You seriously need evidence for that? The general idea is that rational consumers spend money on the things that are most important to them first. Most people will pay the rent before splurging on hookers and blow. Hence, impact of a single dollar is higher for you and me than it is for Bill Gates.




There's nothing wrong with the accumulation of wealth. It's fine for individuals to pursue that end. The government, however, is beholden to the people and should legislate on everyone's behalf. Being on the losing end of some particular policy is not a moral indictment.


Inefficiency is a sort of collateral damage, not an objective in itself. One goal of a politician ~~is~~ *should be* to maximize the average (mean? median?) well-being of his constituents. If seizing a dollar from the rich and giving it to the poor improves general welfare, there's a case to be made.
As you've suggested, maybe taking a dollar from the rich only yields fifty cents' worth of benefit to the poor. You seem to see this as a catastrophic policy failure but I'm not so sure. The aforementioned concept of diminishing marginal utility suggests that we can increase aggregate utility despite decreasing GDP.
It's a balancing act between a variety of objectives (fairness, efficiency, aggregate utility, etc.). Dogmatists who over-weight a single aim inevitably propose some batshit ideas. Ideological purity is intellectually comforting but just ain't feasible in practice. Free market zealotry becomes even less defensible as technology obviates more blue collar jobs.




Not sure what you're getting at here. Do brakes occasionally catch fire? If so, the above statement sounds perfectly reasonable. If something has potential for harm but is statistically more likely to help, isn't it 'good'? That's why we wear seatbelts even though they sometimes trap people in burning/submerging vehicles.


Every time something goes wrong, libertarians claim that it's due to lack of a true free market. I posit that a perfectly free market is simply not possible. Society won't work without taxes. You can't hold businesses accountable for externalities without some form of oversight. Some functions (e.g. national defense) will naturally attract free riders. You shouldn't allow businesses to incur liabilities in excess of their capacity to compensate victims (e.g. building nuclear reactors without adequate safeguards). Privatizing all government functions would be an inefficient logistical nightmare. And charity only takes you so far. Anarcho-capitalism sounds cool but I've yet to hear anyone articulate a practical explanation of how it would really work.
To my original point, if there is no [publicly funded] social safety net, desperate people become a problem. They turn to crime, contract communicable diseases and cause all kinds of havoc. Personally, I'd prefer not to wade through crowds of lepers on my way to work.
@_date: 2015-12-25 09:41:51


Although redistributive policies may reduce efficiency of the system, they can also increase average quality of life. Diminishing marginal utility limits how much the ultra-rich can appreciate their wealth. Also, technology is increasing productivity to the point where "efficient allocation of scarce resources" is less important. Lastly, there are a whole lot of reasons to believe that naked capitalism is not so efficient after all:
* wealthy special interests corrupt political process
* as social safety net breaks down, marginalized/desperate members of society become problems for everyone else
* externalities (pollution, etc.)

If we get to the point where BTC replaces national currencies, the 'unregulated deflationary currency' thing will become a serious problem.

Technological benefits of blockchain are orthogonal to deflationary/inflationary currency discussion. There's no technical reason that Bitcoin couldn't be configured with floor of 1% annual supply increase (or something like that). IMHO, symbiotic coexistence of deflationary &amp; inflationary currency is only possible until the former reaches some critical mass. If BTC starts supplanting national currencies, why would anyone put their savings into any other denomination?
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:14:05
There are actually some pretty good reasons to prefer a mildly inflationary currency versus a deflationary one (e.g. sticky wages). We're still in incubation phase but, if bitcoin actually takes over the world, we're probably better off with a targeted 1% annual increase in total quantity (or something like that). In this case, even bitcoin owners should recognize benefit of raising hard limit.

The "if you already bought bitcoin" qualifier adds no value. You're doubling down on the exact sentiment that I meant to condemn. Purchase price of an asset isn't relevant to a rational investor. All that matters is what he thinks something is worth, where it's headed in the future, how it stacks up against other options, etc. Trying to avoid selling at a loss is a rookie mistake. Better to let go of the past and reassess one's positions with a clean slate.

I don't know that Bitcoin warrants the institutional response that it's gotten. However, I can pretty easily imagine new technologies for which a laissez-faire policy would be horribly inappropriate. What happens when printers advance to the point of facilitating widespread forgery? Or bio-engineering schematics enable personalized virus manufacture? Or DIY fusion reactors become a thing? Self-replicating nano-machines?
My point is that technological innovation requires an evolution of law and we'll probably have to give up some liberties sooner or later. I'm not suggesting that we just roll over but indefinite deferral to the founding fathers is a recipe for disaster. Only not really, because the Constitution was designed to allow for change. IMHO, coming at this thing like an ideologue runs the risk of "proving too much." Do you really want to live in a world where the government is completely neutered?
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:13:55
AFAIK, sidechaining has not yet been implemented for Bitcoin. Bitcoins are not 'converted' into altcoins. With proof of burn, Bitcoins are destroyed and altcoins are simultaneously conjured into existence in whatever way their founders see fit. Once the burner has altcoins, he cannot re-exchange them for Bitcoins unless he's willing to go through a third party.

It's a limit on **cash** withdrawals and can apparently be circumvented by making arrangements in advance. Paying for major expenses in cash is rather unusual for most people. Why do you pay your rent that way? Is it such a burden to withdrawal some money a day in advance?
Personally, I appreciate the ounce of prevention with regards to large transactions. I prefer not to lose vast sums of money next time I'm under duress or drunk or something. And credit card companies *should* monitor for suspicious activity. You may disagree on the exact thresholds but surely you appreciate the need for some controls.

Bill Gates is obviously not an idiot. Cash is comparable to Bitcoin but it's more difficult to transport [in bulk], easier to seize, harder to exchange without meeting a recipient, etc. From a "law and order" perspective, Bitcoin exacerbates all of the problems associated with cash.
Personally, I don't think unlimited anonymity is some sacrosanct right. There are trade-offs whose pros and cons evolve over time. Advocates who willfully fail to see the difference between Bitcoin and cash are little better than those Second Amendment nuts who feel the same way about slingshots versus rocket launchers.
Bitcoin has a lot going for it and I think the good outweighs the bad. Nevertheless, claiming that it's hypocritical to support cash while opposing Bitcoin is disingenuous at best.

I suggest some basic googling. Bitcoin and altcoin blockchains are completely independent. The Bitcoin blockchain is ignorant of everything except for the fact that coins were sent to a [one-way] address. Sender of coins can verify that they were burned but that's the extent of what's done within Bitcoin ecosystem.
Altcoin developers may choose to reward Bitcoin burners with freshly minted cryptocurrency. In this case the 'exchange rate' is entirely up to the altcoin development team.

As others have mentioned, burned coins cannot be reclaimed, reactivated or recovered. While your sidechain proposal sounds technically feasible, it's not what's being done at the moment. You had it right when you were "under the impression that the bitcoins were permanently destroyed."
Realistically speaking, there will exist unburned coins for the foreseeable future. It's true that the slow bleed of coins is deflationary but that's just the way it is. Sidechains or no, there will always be people who simply lose their private keys.
As currently implemented, Bitcoin is designed to become more and more scarce once the last coins are mined. Since Bitcoins are highly divisible, this isn't a catastrophic issue. Will be a long time before a single Satoshi has any meaningful value.

It's reasonable to suggest that default limits ought to be higher and that accountholders should be able to waive them altogether. Nevertheless, methinks you're blowing this out of proportion.

In opposition to the Libertarian ethos that pervades this subreddit, I do believe that banking regulations have their place. However, this particular issue hardly warrants intervention.

Personally, I don't see the problem with supporting the underclass via public assistance versus mandating a living wage. If we had a robust social safety net, deflated defense budget and legitimately progressive tax system; ditching the minimum wage would be no big deal. There would probably be some efficiency gains due to reduced market distortions.

I differentiate between Schiff and the modern GOP because the former seems to be acting in good faith. Right or wrong, it's at least *plausible* that Peter endorses policies that he thinks are best for the country. To the extent that he rejects entitlements spending, I suspect it's because he believes it's unsustainable.
It's my impression that Schiff is a single-issue guy. He hates inflation &amp; deficit spending and doesn't really care how they're curtailed. Unlike the typical Republican, Peter advocates shrinking the defense budget, for example. He doesn't claim that tax cuts will pay for themselves. He doesn't lie or prevaricate or adopt politically expedient positions. The man can be reasoned with.
A [two-party] political system depends upon compromise between honest actors across the political spectrum. That's why I find myself supporting such disparate voices as Peter Schiff and AOC. Unfortunately, we find ourselves choosing between a conservative party that's wholly compromised and liberal one that's just *mostly* corrupt. Peter Schiff is one of the only conservative pundits who's not a transparent con-man. Is it fair to grade on a curve?
I agree that there are many ways to improve the plight of the 99%. Any system that fails to do so is a non-starter in my mind. I just don't feel that anti-Schiff liberals (the Sanders crowd?) pay adequate heed to the efficiency of their preferred solution. People are too busy being outraged to care about the underlying economics.
Some of the heartless stuff Peter Schiff says gets misinterpreted. For example, I doubt he thinks special-needs employees should be left to fend for themselves on $2/hour. Obviously, the government or some other entity would need to help make ends meet. I took his point to be that there's not a huge market for mentally challenged staff at the federally mandated minimum wage. By allowing the market to dictate salary, more people will be able to do something fulfilling and productive.
Businesses are good at generating wealth while government programs are good for helping people. To the extent that we can separate the two mandates, we ought to.

I believe Schiff's opposition is genuine. He claims that the bitcoin he accepts is immediately converted to fiat. He's given us no reason not to take him at his word. Unlike Nike, Euro Pacific Capital could easily pivot to recommending a different underlying product if CEO thought it made sense.
Peter seems to have two arguments:
1. Cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value.
2. Due to a proliferation of projects and unlimited forking, crypto isn't really a scarce quantity.
His first argument might have some legitimacy if his preferred investment, gold, actually had significant innate value. However, if it weren't used as a medium of exchange, gold would probably trade at something like $100/oz. I wonder if he's ever publicly addressed this point.
@_date: 2019-11-10 22:46:52
Got to admire Pete's consistency. Rain or shine, he's been making the same argument for like 30 years. How does such a one-dimensional analyst make a living? He could be replaced by a chatbot. That being said, the man is more principled than 99% of the Republican party. I actually donated to his Senate campaign.
