I know im late but I don't think you'll regret this. You've have given your self an extra chance of being wealthier, which is more psychologically valuable than most richer people would give it credit. You've also used it as motivation live healthier, its win win.  Plus if bitcoin is something you want to see do well, then how better to cheer it on than owning a little.
I don't get why people say bitcoin is too volatile for this kind of investor.  He's not going to be the one crying if it all goes tits up.  Its surely the people who already have a lot of assets to throw in, or those who borrow for it that stand to loose out most from its volatility.  
I earn just £8/hour and I've loved owning a little btc because while I'm at work  my bitcoin can gain or loose so much more than I earn. Its a strange feeling if you are used to feeling tied to that grind with no hope,  even when the value is falling its nice that there's more of an element of chance to life again. It can make you feel less trapped and its passive enough not to get u hooked into gambling.

Just my guess that if it comes back down it wont go below 5k USD. 5k is such an attractive price point. Seemed to bounce off 5k in GBP.

I was waiting for another dip to buy my last bits too, think I should give up waiting.

hodlers understand,  Im holding because I Know I can't be a trader.
Honestly - when I made what I thought was a sensible decision to sell on the way down when it got to 13k the second time. (I thought its definitely going to come down much lower)  well from the moment I sold I was like constantly watching the charts and worrying until I eventually panic bought back in at almost the same price.
clearly my brain is far more worried about missing the boat than it is about loosing my investment.     
Thats why I hodl.  I can get on with my life and hodl.
