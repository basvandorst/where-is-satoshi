You make it seem like the economic requirements differ drastically from market to market. Typical CB policy, such inflationary targets, promotes growth in every sector (compared to deflation), and managing a currency in this, and other criteria (e.g. low volatility) allows it to be used as an effective medium of exchange.
  
I find it funny that people think bitcoin is somehow resistant to CB control. Sure, the ability to influence the monetary supply is somewhat limited/more expensive, but the actual policies that the CB may implement extend far beyond such simplistic measures. The same is true for the actual value of BTC. It is in no way immune to the influence of governments, and can be controlled just like any other floating currency.
  
Bringing this back to the OPs point, no, bitcoin does not fulfill the criteria allowing it to fully replace money, and this will not change without outside influence.

Although most people seem to believe the CB just spits out money all day with hopes of influencing the economy, this is a quite modern and controversial approach to regulation (see quantitative easing). Either way here are some examples of CB regulation:
  
A commonly used tool for exchange rate manipulation is a large foreign reserve, allowing a CB to buy/sell their currency to influence demand/supply.
Another example is the most important tool in monetary policy, the base interest rate. The decentralisation of a currency does not change the interest rate you pay on a loan. Remember, (significantly sized) loans will only be given by banks.

What makes you think people trust the government not to "fuck with the currency supply"? 
Monetary Policy is an effective tool at promoting economic growth, which undoubtedly brings benefits to everyone.
