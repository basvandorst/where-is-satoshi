If he wins the appeal and is vindicated, then he may be able to claim the coins, because of double jeopardy.

Breadwallet is insanely slow. It may never even index the blockchain to see if your transaction got a confirmation. As far as mobile wallets go, I recommend Mycelium.

Your crude language does not disguise the fact that you don't understand bitcoin. Society has moved to accepting bitcoin as money. Perhaps not you, but there is a vein in society that operates outside the financial system entirely. It will survive and thrive and is independent of the dollar, though it uses the dollar to wipe its ass.

It wasn't simply a matter of a decimal place or an extra x10 though. Also, do you know what exchange it was? Why do you think it was an exchange reporting erroneously? I would like to look into the blockchain and find what was happening at that time, but I can't find a good mechanism to search the blockchain for this info by time of the transaction. Do you know any ways for searching the blockchain for a transaction based on the given time frame?

Bank of America, huh? ... and Wells Fargo... and Chase.... and Coinbase, so yeah, more than just Bank of America. More than I just listed there.

Absolutely. I'd also recommend that you check out  
They allow you to post any code that you like within the collaborative framework of an online band. So you could put the payment wall right beneath the notes for each song that you post on the website.
 They have a patent on their current technology and will soon receive a patent on virtual currency sales as well.

OK, fair enough, but more investigation would be required for me to rule out an actual transaction of extraordinarily large volume.

God is a real word that has real meaning to real people. The word God means many things to many different people. I wouldn't conflate what the money says with how it behaves either. It's a common tactic of the government these days to label a poison as a tonic. Also, please keep in mind that the paper currency is printed by a private bank, and they have the right to write whatever they want on it. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:33:48
Wow, that is a very good point. I wish I had thought of that, but I just settled for figuring it was because they had screwed over so many good customers that was the real reason they were banned. I think they just used the Bitcoin XT debate as a reason. For the record, I'm Pro - BTC XT, and I don't care to debate it. When it's time is ready, we won't have to.

To her credit, BTC is vulnerable momentarily to an EMP. Gold and silver not so. An EMP attack would mess stuff up so badly, you might not be able to sync with the rest of the network for a long, long time

Coinbase has f*%# over a bunch of important bitcoin players. Maybe that's why.

Sounds like you are one of those people who runs around like a chicken with its head cut off asking questions before googling and criticizing critical/original thinking instead of simply just accepting something for what it says.

This is actually a great feature. If you built it into mobile wallets, you could have it as a security feature in an attempt to recover stolen funds before a confirmation had set.

Bitcoin's not for pansies.

Coinbase is a bad company. They say one thing and do another. They will lead you on and then pull the rug out from under you. They will quote you one price and give you a different one. They will refuse to trust you after you've proven you can be trusted. They do not behave like an American business. They behave more like an annoying Western Union clerk in Mexico or like a socialist bureaucrat from France.

After ordering an ATM from them, I waited for several months, and I repeatedly contacted them with no reply for over 4 months after the expected delivery date. Eventually, I contacted BitPay, and the guy seemed pretty desperate. He had his account frozen by them until he issued me a refund. He insisted on giving me the dollar value of the coins from the time, but I insisted on the full amount of coins returned. Eventually, BitPay came through for me and forced him to give me back the total number of coins I had paid, since I never received anything for months and moths. I came to the conclusion personally, and it is only my personal belief that they are a ponzi.

Gold is not dying. 
1) Even when bankers smother it, it's not able to die, because it's not alive.
2) Chinese and Indians like gold. So do libertarians.
3) There are a lot of Chinese and Indian people who believe in gold.
4) Gold is legit for making rings of power and amulets of light.
5) Gold may go down in terms of BTC, but not as fast as fiat will.
6) BTC velocity will exacerbate the revelation of the gold manipulation situation.
These are my thoughts on why gold will "survive."

I'm sorry you are having trouble wit Coinbase. They are very disorganized, and their decision makers are predominately automatons. You can't really get in touch with anyone who actually makes real decisions, rather, they get filtered through a middle manager of some sort with no real authority. Best of luck.

I am looking at an uptrend's continuing, perhaps with an imminent bubbling past the 770 pre-brexit high. A flag off of a pennant, I'd say we're going up. Bitcoin tends to accumulate into hands that can't readily dispose of it. With the halvening, supply will be going relatively lower while demand remains constant.
