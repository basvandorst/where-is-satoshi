It's not what is said, it's said if you are suspected, then they can take your cash.  
You are not a criminal you are a suspect, and they take the cash because of that, not because you have it.
I don't know how it works in USA, but in France it works similar. When they raid alleged drug dealers, they take all the cash they find as it's part of the proof. And they keep it untill the suspect is cleared, which can take years.
This is completely normal.

1) I don't think carrying foreign currency is illegal in the US. Otherwise currency change desks would be illegal.
2) It would be verified the same way you verify any bill that you use every day: you look at it, if it looks like a normal bill you trust it.
3) You never prove a bill come from its minter, but if you want to do it you can check its printing, if it looks legit then it comes from the minter.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:51:07
Ok, that's an interesting answer, at least for USA and I believe lot of countries work like that.
So the answer would be that it's a legal challenge, would be expensive and there are maybe not enough users yet for it to be profitable.


In most countries the minter is a private company recognized by the state as its official minter. For the bitcoin any private company would do as long as it's recognized/trusted by enough people.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:08:06


By "getting paid", I mean the moment the buyer can leave the seller. You are paid when the money is in your possession (in your bank account or in your hands).
I'm trying to reinvent notes. All notes works like that.


Only the minter get paid to print money

I would accept Uzbekistan notes that I know I can exchange for Euros. 
Some private company can issue notes and coins.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:02:22
No, a bill that acts like a normal bill. Like a 100$ bill. A pretty paper hard to make and guaranteed by its bank.
The value is written on it. (eg: 0.01฿) and the customs can do like for every other bill to check the value. I think they check on the internet, they don't know all the exchange rates by heart.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:32:54
No private key on it, and the bill would be as worthless than any bill and work as any bill.
You want to pay 0.01฿ you give a bill of 0.01฿, you paid. The other party just trusts that it is worth 0.01฿ because the bill is hard to make and the emitter guarantee it would exchange it against something worth 0.01฿ (in any currency).
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:36:31


The minter get temporarily paid 1 BTC by whoever give him 1 BTC in exchange of a high security paper that represent 1 BTC.


You get your change in BTC, though I've seen small merchants giving EUR change after I paid in CHF. Yes the merchant needs to buy BTC to give change, minter is happy.


It's easier for the customer, not the merchant, but the merchant want to please its customers. It's not my system, I didn't invent notes. Customer benefit from this because it's easier for him, minter benefit from this because it's lucrative to mint, BTC benefit from this because it bring more users.

The amount of people saying that it's not a bubble, make me think it's bubbly though.
There is a lot of fanatism here. People encouraging themselves and downvoting doubting people like me. And that is also bubble like.
The very fact that people feel the need need to say "Great job" to someone for giving his opinion is very disturbing. It look like he's being encouraged to say it's not a bubble.
This make it looks like a pyramidal scam. And this is the only reason I do not invest more.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:48:11


How would you figure out the exchange rate?
Yes sorry I typed too quick I was in the hurry. I would only accept notes if I am a Uzbeki sympathiser or I lived with a lot of Uzbeki and I already seen a note.
It would take me a week or two in average to go to the bank. No need to be in the hurry. I lived near France/Swiss border and I had Swiss and Euros. And when I was young and we did the transition Franc to Euro I also had both. Same when we went in vacation in Spain. It's not really a problem, and if the exchange rate move you have a bit more or a bit less and you don't even notice.




Every minter bank can bankrupt, but it happen very rarely because it's a very good business to sell paper. Though it happened.


All notes have "T&amp;Cs" that are not printed on it. Like don't print them unless you write "specimen" on it, don't burn them, etc... not a problem if the T&amp;Cs are reasonable and otherwise the minter lose reliability.


Yes it works like that, all notes works like that. When you get 0.01 BTC note, the high security paper cost 0.0005 BTC to make (2 USD, which is expensive, 100 EUR notes cost 2 cent to produce), they give it to you in exchange of 0.01 BTC (or a bit more, they can tax like ATM). So they earned 0,0095 BTC in the process. Plus ATM taxes, plus currency change tax if you buy in another currency.
Of course you can claim your money back, if everyone does that they bankrupt, but everyone doesn't. Also every people that lost a note give the company that value for ever, and it's a lot of money in 2013 French people lost 92 million EUR and English people lost 95 million worth of Euro in notes or coins [(source FR)](

The note doesn't cost the minter 1 BTC at all. He sells it for 1 BTC but it's only paper, it cost between .0005 BTC and .00005 BTC.


I know it's not easy to understand, but it's one of the most profitable business. Minter sell paper at gold's price. Paper is cheap as hell.
Minter guarantee he will give BTC if you return the paper, BUT not everyone will never return all the papers at the same time.


You are obviously living in a big country and not traveling much. If you live in small countries sometimes you need 3 or 4 different currencies... or you could have only 1 international one. Plus you fight the banksters when using BTC.


Thank you for trying but your reasons don't convince me because you mostly look like you don't understand how minting works. I had I good reason from someone else so far, and it's about legal matters (it's illegal to mint or exchange unrecognized currency in some countries like USA).

I already told you. You would only accept Uzbeki notes if you are a Uzbeki sympathiser or you lived with a lot of Uzbeki and you already seen a note. Same with bitcoin. 
When 50 tourists ask you every day if you accept Swiss Francs/bitcoin, and half of them have nothing else to pay. At the begining you say "no", after few days you tell them where they can change the money, after a while you accept the Swiss Francs or bitcoin and you change the money yourself.


Once again, the minter get temporarily paid 1 BTC (+ATM and change fees) when he sell notes that represent 1 BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:51:31
You made some pretty good points, like the fraud problem, or if many companies start to emit BTC notes. 
Also you are right it's not much better to use BTC notes than normal fiat, but my point is it's not better to use fiat than BTC notes either. In the case everyone use it of course. I agree it will be hard at the begining. 
So there is a lot of problems, but I think they can be overcame with money and a lot of efforts. Because BTC will never become the international currency without being able to be used like fiat (with 1s trusted transactions, and without internet)
And we still disagree on the profitability of the system for the minter. I agree minting fiat is minting debt, but debt is profitable, especially in this case where the debt doesn't NEED to be reimbursed and is easily lost (remember French lose 90 million a year, so it's like 1 or 2 EUR per capita and per year).
I also disagree about Bitcoin being trustless. You just trust different things, like the trust other people have in BTC, the cryptography, the internet, and many more.
Bitcoin is just a decentralized, or open, currency.

I don't care if you lose your money, but there have been no correction since it rose from 3k. If you think it will only drop 10% you are wrong.

When we say "store of value", it means for long term. long enough to buy chicken is not long term so it is not a store of value.
Currencies are not a store of value because they lose value with time.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:21
It will drop very quick for 2 reasons:
-Now people won't have the 2nd coin so BTC has less value.
-We where expecting a huge correction (to 5k) and people will be afraid it trigger the correction, so it will trigger the correction.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:50:44
If people buy because people buy, it is overvalued. 
In the future it won't be overvalued if people use BTC. Here we all gamble on either if a last fool will buy our BTC when we decide to sell (for BTC traders), or if people will use BTC one day (for Hodlers).

We are going to see 5k soon, 4k at most. 
3500 would be a crash and I don't think it happens except if the fork show problems.
I don't invent the numbers, BTC (and a lot of values) always dip 50% of its last rise, after a rise. So 3000 to 7500 means it's going to drop around 5k

At the moment it's completely a bubble. 90% of people buy only because it's going up, on other words they buy because other people buy.

No, currencies are not made to store a value for long term. A currency is for transaction. 
Current stores of value are: buildings, fields, metal, diversified company shares, art. A store of value doesn't lose it's value with time. Currencies lose their values as they are minted.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:30:46
But it is a speculative bubble. 
90% of people buy bitcoin because the price is rising. That's the definition of speculative bubble.
At one point the price is going to stop rising. At this point, either those 90% people decide Bitcoin is better than their banks, or the price will go down. But it may as well be in 20 years I don't know.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:57:30
That's BTC to BTC transaction. BTC to fiat is more expensive. Transferring less than 6000 euros to any other currency cost less than 30 euros (0,5%).
Plus Bitcoin fees will rise as Bitcoin rise in price and popularity.
For huge amounts it may be profitable but not for my use of international transferts.

Fair enough, but I still don't like the term for money as it's misleading. Store means long term for me.
Anyway I don't want to fight on relatives terms, money is a short term store of value if you want.

The thing is you want to solve problems before they happen. Centralization is not a problem yet, the size of the block chain neither. The problem nowadays are the fees, the confirmation time, and the mempool too full. Humanity resolve problems when they happen, not before, only centralized entities try to anticipate.
I don't think BCash is the perfect coin, I just think its specs (except adoption) are better than Bitcoin core.
I think many coins will rise, eat their predecessor and be eaten by the next coin before one win the world. Bitcoin is the Greek empire that thinks he will run the world forever, eaten by Romans, eaten by Germans, eaten by Russians, eaten by USA (sorry history, just want to make things simple). Each empire though his rule would last forever.
TL;DR: Crypto still can be improved, the perfect coin isn't born yet, BCash may be the next step to conquer the world, but won't be the last.

What you described is not Bitcoin, it's cryptocurrencies.
As you said it has tremendous value but this value is diluted because you can make an infinite amount of cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin's value is to be the biggest cryptocurrency. This value can disappear one day. And most of the things that can disappear one day, disappear one day. It can be in a long time though.

Because BTC was crashing, we had a bull trap that bounced on the 3k support, now it's going to bounce down on the 4k support and possibly go under 3k.
Buy at 3k if you think it's going to bounce again and want to trade. Otherwise buy below. We are after a huge spike it's going to go slowly down for a few months.

I don't own USD in my portfolio. A currency is not an investment. And BTC is closer to gold than to currencies.

And what are the chances he brute forces it before you know about your safe being breached and move the BTC ?
That's a good security feature, very easy to implement.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:01:02
Only put $40k if you have $200k in savings or more.
Bitcoin might crash at any time. Impossible to predict.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:07:52
Just wait, this is a bull trap bouncing on the 3k support. It's going down again and will either break the 3k support or bounce again, it's hard to predict. But you'll be able to buy 3k bitcoins in a few days if not today for sure.

It doesn't need anything crazy happening now. The crazy thing already happened, BTC did +500% in 6 months. 
It will go down because people over reacted.
I also think it will come back at $5000, but maybe in 3 years.

You can have good working tech and overestimated price. You seem to think that drop in prices are only caused by problems in tech.
The next all time low is uncertain. However it's not now, we are just after a huge spike. And how many BTC you hold depend on if you buy them at $4500 or at $3000.

No but if you buy your Bitcoins in dollar, yes.

I don't see how a fake node could steal from me for running a node.
But I guess it would be easy to check the integrity of the truncated block-chain by simply comparing a hash of the truncated blockchain  from a lot of nodes. Plus that's something you do only once so even if you compare haschs from 1 million nodes (which is exagerated) you only downloaded 70 Mo (for 1 million SHA512 hash) + the size of the 1 year block chain.
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:52:25
I know computer specifications scale in time.
But what if they don't scale as fast as the success of BTC ?And it's not only about storage space, but also about internet bandwidth.
The entire block chain is useless data, it can be reduced in size.
We don't need the full history: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; ... -&gt; D79 -&gt;E79 for every bitcoin.  
A -&gt; &lt;hash&gt; -&gt; D79 -&gt; E79 is enough

It will reach 100k one day, but it will crash many times in between.
And this man is right, if he sells every times before the crash and buy after it he will be a lot richer than people who just hodled.
If you think bitcoin will never crash again you are wrong.

This trick would give OP a few more hours to move his BTC before the thief does. If the thief does not give up.

Yes but people are still greedy. Just wait a few months to see the real fear that BTC will never rise again, and buy at this time.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:38:50


Why ? You just demonstrated it was a good security feature. 
It takes a literate computer and crypto user that knows there are 3 letters modified 32 minutes once he gets home. With an improvement in the method I'm sure you can even increase that time to 1 day. It gives you time to move the BTC before the thief does.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:29:36

It's harder to buy 2kg gold undetected than 20 bitcoins. And I would not be confident burying 2kg gold anywhere. 
It's much easier to encrypt your private key, and store it on multiple dropbox. And you lose only 3% by buying/selling bitcoin. if you buy/sell actual gold you pay more fees (like 10% at least).

It's instant, but happens in different exchanges, so maybe your exchange reacted to the an other exchange going up.
Some are also playing the rebound for short term profit because it is expected to rebound on the 3k psychological support before either going down (what I think) or going up.

It's not a security model, the security model is the paper wallet stored in a safe. It relies on the safe being hard to breach.
OP's trick is an additional security feature, very easy to implement and that could save your money in many cases if the security model is breached.

Price won't double just because inflation is divided by two.

Ofc it's better, change 2 letters and if someone break your house and see your paper wallet it gives you few hours or days to move your BTC before he figures it out.
Thiefs with crypto and computer skills are rare. Those capable to find your trick is brute forceable and do it in few minutes are even more rare.

If you want to make a difference in 10 years, don't rush to buy after a huge spike. Buy in a few months when the price stabilize.
Right now, it's at $4000. Let's say in 6 months it is at $2500. If bitcoin goes to $10k in 10 years you'll have $36,000.00

You don't need to verify transactions back to genesis more than once.
Once verified you can delete it, you don't need to verify it twice.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:33:22
I do, but I think you do not understand the dip may be closer to a 2 year dip than a 1 week dip. 
And while cost averaging is clever, repeating "buy the dip !" makes it feel like there is an urgent need to buy while you'd better wait for the spike to stabilize if you are not a trader like most of us are not I think.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:24:53
There is a problem and BTC just lost $300 in 40 min
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:32:17
Of course... It's a normal bull trap bounce on the 3k support. Just look at previous BTC crashes and the same thing happens.
People think crashes happen in 2 days, look at previous crashes with the same zoom. It's going to slowly go down for 1 year with a lot of bounces and false hopes.  
And then after some time it's going to suddently peak to 10k.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:25:55
Only the miners need the transaction from genesis.
Your node only verify it once (as it download it for the first time) then delete the useless data. Or trust all the other  node and download only the relevant data.

The way you paid is relevant since the government can't enforce legal actions on bitcoin accounts.
Sometime I don't need government, but sometime I prefer to have it.
Maybe my exemple with a house is not the best, but government can freeze or rollback someone's bank account if needed. Bank transferts are also better to prove how much you paid.

I agree on fee cap, but not on your explanation.
* 1 sat/byte is close to free but it isn't free
* Some things are free. You don't pay air. Plants work for you for free.
* You pay miners even if all Tx in the block are 0 sat/byte. The 12.5 BTC they earn devaluate BTC: it's like if everyone holding BTC pay them for the right to do transactions.
