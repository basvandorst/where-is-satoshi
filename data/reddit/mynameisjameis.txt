Doesn't pooling mean that you reduce the chance that you will search the same space that someone else in the pool is searching?  eg: you lose value if you're covering the same ground someone else is searching (or has already searched)

Educate yourself a little ( and you might realize that they're not doing it to be dicks.  They're doing it because **they have to** if they want to keep their trademark.

perhaps OP's company is counting on folks who have already sunk $ into the hardware and need a place with cheap electricity rates.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:40:55


You actually have it exactly backwards.
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:09:35
yep, exactly.

I think most people who don't have a lot of money end up spending it on *something* instead of choosing to save it.
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:18:21
Well, if you're going to prove that someone is wrong, then you have to do just that.  You can't say "oh I didn't mean for realsies."
@_date: 2014-12-08 03:21:57


This is not provably true.  An irrational actor who cares for something besides money could keep mining even at a loss.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:48:20
I'm not sure what you're getting at.  Are you saying that no one will come back to see if someone turned in their money that they lost, but they would for a jersey or a pair of glasses?
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:39:23


Try reading his statement again.  There are 2 entities that he is referring to, not one.
@_date: 2014-12-02 02:43:40
Honestly, who cares?  The price of bitcoin fluctuates so much, even if you bought them with 0% transaction fees (or atm fees) you might still lose $40 by the time you "get home."
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:21:49
It was only an unsatisfactory outcome because OP scoffed at the idea that the transit folks would hold onto the money in case the original owner came back for it:
*"she...insisted that he was under an obligation to hand it in, you know, in case someone has lost it and comes back to find it. Yeah... right. I expressed my incredulity."*
Just because OP doesn't have faith in that protocol does not mean that the protocol is wrong.  It's not perfect, but it's a system that works most of the time.

dude, could you be more of a dick?
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:53:39
I agree: at this point in time, it makes no sense to get into mining.  But it seems like there are a lot of people who got into in the past year or so who have to try to get as much out of it as they can.

@_date: 2014-11-21 00:48:56
Hmm, I think you're right.  I'm doing searches now on advantages of pooled vs solo mining and none of them mention the search space being intelligently divided amongst pool participants.
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:09:36
ah, good input.  that makes sense. thanks. :)

thx.  edited
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:01:40
true, but i think the takeaway from that book is that no matter what the rules are, those guys on the inside will find a way around them, and then it will  take years(?) before anyone catches on, and by that time all of the people who got screwed over have already suffered because of the losses...etc.

Please point to the "very public" opposition.  As far as I know, he was not public at all about it.  He made a private donation to a cause he believed in and someone dug up that donation information and **they** made it public, not him.

I would suggest not adding the part about anonymity.  In all honesty, the masses **no not care** about anonymity.  Plus, by bringing it up, it almost makes it seem like there's a reason you'd want to be anonymous (eg: you're doing something illegal...even though you're not).
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:00:40


Heh.  Not so.  The way they ousted Brendan Eich shows that they only care about freedoms when they align with their own world view.

in fairness, it's not a data center in the way that we think of a data center (eg: web hosting, servers, etc), right?
it's just basically a place where the computers just churn and churn and churn.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:50:23
yeah, in that book from last year (Flash Boys?), when i read the part about how **my** fucking brokerage firm was routing my orders to exchanges that were throwing the brokerage a kickback even though the trade on that exchange wasn't in **my** best interest...well, that pretty much told me everything i needed to know about how that fucking scam works.
my $ is now no longer in the market.

Chase owns their banks.  They can do business with whomever they choose.  They can close the accounts of anyone they choose not to do business with.
What about any of that is illegal?

Well, you are fairly wrong.
When you share a google doc, you can set the viewing permissions so that only certain people can see it.  This means that they will have to be signed in to see it.

Guess what, genius: many of the people who don't quite believe all the hype, like myself, are professional software engineers who understand both the mathematics and software underpinning blockchain technology in incredible detail.
Also, many of us have been in the industry long enough to recognize bullshit when we see it.  Now, I'm not saying that the blockchain is BS (I actually think it's pretty cool and that it has potential to do *something* useful), but I am nowhere near convinced enough to say it's a game changer like the internet is/was.  It has too many holes/problems still.  Perhaps they'll be worked out.  Perhaps they won't.  And that makes anybody who believes in it 100% (such as yourself) look and sound like a cultist.

honest question: if the majority of people mainly use $ to exchange labor for goods and services (eg: they work, get a paycheck, cash the check and then pay their rent, buy groceries, etc), then does it really matter?
i mean, if everyone agreed that coke bottles were the new form of currency, then it doesn't really matter, overall, what is backing those bottles as long as their value stays roughly 100% the same during the timeframe when i am using them to get paid for work and then use them to pay for things i want, right?
