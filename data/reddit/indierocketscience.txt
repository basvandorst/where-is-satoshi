I could not find one. I still have my BTW on bitpie

Yeah that was my process and I provided a bitpie BTD address but the actual sending part failed. I successfully got my BTW through this method but the BTD and SBTC failed.

How did you actually redeem your BTD? The Bitpie/bither method did not work for me as of a week ago because of a failure within the app to actually send the BTD to a new address.

What tool is used to make this visualization?

I feel the other commenters are jumping the gun to assume it’s a transaction congestion issue and not a network propagation issue.
Even if it’s slow to get confirmed you would at least be provided with a transaction hash by Coinbase.
Go to your dashboard on Coinbase.com, find your pending transaction in recent activity and click on it. There will be a popup that comes up. Does the popup contain 4 fields ‘To’, ‘Confirmations’, ‘Fee’ AND ‘Transaction’ or is it missing ‘Transaction’?
If you are provided with the Transaction field then you can click ‘view transaction’ and see its information. In that case you’ll just have to wait for it to be confirmed by the bitcoin network. However, if you do NOT see the transaction field I bet Coinbase encountered some kind of error and didn’t actually propagate your withdrawal to the network, thus there is no transaction you can look up.
Make a support ticket if that is the case. Good luck.

USAA integrates with Coinbase and shows you your Coinbase balances in BTC, LTC, ETH, and USD.

I’ve been buying with them. How much have you been exchanging out?

Why aren't I 50 bitcoins ahead you might ask?

If there is a cash seller in your area, they will be on localbitcoins. If you don't see one, you might be out of luck given your constraints.

I've been using BTCjam as an investor since June. Every time I think I have a system of screening loans figured out, someone who had been an awesome borrower either runs into hard times or is a long con scammer. The bottom line is no matter what the person's repayment history is, there is virtually no recourse if that user doesn't pay. Sure after 90 days of nonpayment you get the user's basic info, phone, email, and social network, but not an address. It's not worth going through legal means to collect unless you've invested multiple Bitcoin in the same loan.
BTCjam also makes it exceptionally hard to contact borrowers and other lenders through the site (no PM feature) and the site blacklists many borrowers from even commenting on their own loans, which I think is the stupidest thing.
All that said, my NAR is still positive (single digits) and increasing. I've stuck it out this far, might as well keep going :)
One place I've made a lot of money is in the note marketplace. People often undervalue their notes or wanna cash out from Jam. Or they get panicky the moment a loan goes overdue and list it cheap. I've even picked up a couple notes where people were selling healthy notes at 1/10th remaining value. I just wish it had better filtering options.
Good luck with your remaining investments!
