BTC losing it's market share hurts the ASIC miners the most. If people decide to move to another coin, sure they'll lose some money but they won't have millions invested in useless hardware. BU pushing their agenda happens at their own peril, especially when the code is full of bugs.

It would be good if bitcoin core developers took this opportunity to talk and iron things out. Working together and compromising is the way to move bitcoin forward.

I don't understand how people can support a piece of software like this. It seems like it's easier for BU to just blame core for attacking them, which at this time there's no evidence of such. Even if it is true, there are many people that will attack the bitcoin network. There are alt coins and criminals that want to steal your coins or hurt the bitcoin network. You want your software to not be buggy so **no one** can attack your nodes, it doesn't matter who. It is the responsibility of BU developers to make sure their code is well tested and bug free, but that does not appear to be the case.
BU really needs to review and scrutinize their code because it can get a lot worse like remote code execution where adversaries take control of a node completely and does whatever the adversary wants.
Just think if BU did take over the blockchain a month ago which is worth 16+ billion dollars and these crashes happen, how can you possibly support bitcoin? You traded a heavy and more expensive bucket for a bucket with holes to carry water. People will move to alt coins. These ASIC miners will become unfeasible to operate and even unusable for mining other popular alt coins.

"code musn't just be fast, but it must be absolutely correct."
This is hugely important when you're dealing with a 15+ billion dollar market cap coin.

Yeah I know who you're referring to. I was responding to someone else and making that point that if Russia or any other country brings serious hashing power into bitcoin, the dynamic will drastically change. If a country comes into play I think they will be more of a threat than this miner will ever be. I know this is blasphemous to say but one day, we might need this miner on our side to defend the bitcoin network as we know it. It's extremely important to have miners, major business related to bitcoin, and the core devs to talk right now and be on respectable terms. People can disagree but still respect each other.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:25:20
It would be ideal if Jihan didn't have a monopoly. In the long term someone might produce better ASICs to the point where Jihan no longer becomes a big deal. At this point, you have a new "Jihan" and if they're greedy, they can also try to monopolize the market.
There's just too much that can happen down the road to make a good judgement so it's better not to. Jihan might be the worst now but down the road there might be people that are even worse.
Time will tell though, I guess no one wants to look that far ahead.

Bitcoin does need change and it's going to change when segwit activates in a couple of weeks. Bitcoin will need more changes down the road. When segwit comes online and it does well, it'll be much easier to convince people that perhaps segwit is all we need. I agree BTC1 is not core and I would not run this piece of software.
I think the core devs, miners, and large businesses for bitcoin need to get together and talk. If not 2x, people need to propose alternatives and those ideas need to be discussed. The problem is that no one is talking and just throwing hard fork threats at each other. This is not the way to deal with a big and important of a community as bitcoin.

I don't think all miners are bad, just that the "bad" ones are louder than others. If all they understand is money, some miner groups have significant amounts of money invested in hardware. It is in their best interest to come to the table and negotiate. Politeness goes a long way, especially for future bitcoin upgrades.
To have a private discussion is necessary for proposals to develop in a manner where people aren't in an environment where they're always pressured to defend themselves. Some people treat these public discussions almost as entertainment and try to stir up unnecessary drama and some even have financial motives to do so.


That's definitely a win in my book. From a technical perspective I fully support SegWit. If it works well for a month or so, then it'll be easier to convince others that perhaps SegWit is all we need for now. However, I still believe it is important to keep a communication channel open and try to convince the big bitcoin players that this is indeed the way to go. If people don't talk to each other and just throws hard fork threats at each other, that's no way to get things done (at least not in a big of a community as bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:25:45
I do agree that bitcoin needs unity at this point. This civil war needs to end and even if 2MB is not the most efficient way of doing things, it is a compromise that should be seriously considered by the core devs. Don't punish all the miners for certain actions 1 miner take.
There's a lot more stuff to do for the bitcoin network and if forks keep happening for every disagreement, then bitcoin loses apart of it's user base every time.
There are a lot of people that hold alt coins flaming the drama during this long scaling debate in the hopes of driving down bitcoin prices while boasting their alt coin. At the same time there are big investors that want to play the market using alt coins. People want to see bitcoin fail or take a chunk if bitcoin's market share. As bitcoin holders, we should not let this happen.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:07:07
From what I understand the miners want 2x so they can get more fees per block. If Russia mined as well they would agree with Jihan, not against. If somehow Russia replaces Jihan, do you think Russia would be less aggressive or more aggressive in taking full control of bitcoin? How do you know which will be more or less aggressive? You can't say Jihan is the worst scenario if you haven't seen other possible scenarios because other possibilities can be worse. Someone worse than Jihan can come to power. I know this is blasphemous to say but one day, we might need Jihan on our side. It's extremely important to have miners, major business related to bitcoin, and the core devs to talk. This kind of fork your mother if you want to fork nonsense only hurts the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:20:17
The point is that if there's 3 versions of bitcoin, what would happen? Segwit2x was a compromise to keep the community together, but the big blockers forked their own coin anyway into BCH and never compromised at all. So why would BTC be stuck with implementing this compromise when there's no one to compromise with anymore, especially when core doesn't support segwit2x?
 
The announcement that there's going to be a fork for segwit2x with a set date without even seeing what's going to happen when segwit activates on bitcoin and no plans for replay protection tells me that it's a lot of bark and no bite.
It's manufacturing a reason for people to pump / buy BCH. Funny thing is, it's killing a lot of alt coins in the process. You see a glimpse of how no one really cares about the tech, who the developers are, etc. People just want to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:25:59
I would strongly encourage the Core devs to work something with the miners and do it privately. I think the public tries to egg things on and make things seem a lot worse than it actually is. Then that person is forced to defend themselves which is not good for people to come to a compromise.
Perhaps propose something like a 10% increase every x amount of blocks capped to a certain amount instead of doing an immediate increase to 2MB.
I've been in bitcoin for awhile now and it's really sad to see a community with such potential be so divided. As the saying goes, a house divided cannot stand. Bitcoin has a long road ahead in terms of upgrades and if this keeps happening, it stalls progress and divides the community every time.
I would really appreciate it if you or other core devs reach out and talk to the miners and other bitcoin businesses privately. Communication is crucial at this point between all parties because it is direct communication with these people that will resolve issues.
I think you're doing great work Luke and I appreciate everything you do for bitcoin. Please consider what I said. This is a people issue which can only be solved by people.

It's not about backroom deals. It's about not being ridiculed when you propose an idea. The bitcoin community can always find a flaw when something is proposed. There's enough division and intelligent individuals already in the bitcoin community that nothing will be overlooked.

I disagree with this assessment. You do not want someone to find a bug and exploit the blockchain, especially if your blockchain is much more complex where people can write dapps and execute code on your system. For any digital asset, security always comes first.


When it comes to stored value, reliability and security are a lot more important. This is why BTC is often compared to "gold." When value comes from the potential of a piece of tech that's fairly new, then it's more like the stock market. The first touchscreen was invented in 1965. Microsoft introduced tablets running XP way before apple. At each of those instances, where new tech was introduced, it took a lot of refining, time, and luck before it was adopted. People didn't dump huge amounts of money into them because of the potential.
When it comes to handling digital assets that's worth money, one must consider how likely things will go wrong where you lose this asset. As mentioned earlier, dapps is new tech, it had a bug where people lost money from the famous hack. In principle, to revert transactions because the developers made a mistake in their dapp has a lot of negative implications.
Anyway, I digressed on the main question that I have. At this current state of ETH and BTC, is ETH worth 1.1 times more than bitcoin? If so, why?
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:46:31
Currently, it's worth more than BTC. As in it's adding value more than BTC as of now, per day. I don't think it's incorrect to say it's worth more, because I'm talking about now. I have no idea how much ETH or BTC will be worth even in the near future.
I do follow some ETH news but I have a few problems with how they handled the dapp that failed fiasco and resulted in the creation of ETC. Dapps in general are largely unexplored territory so who knows what happens next. In addition, the "Ethereum foundation" seems to have a lot of influence, more than what I consider as a "decentralized" system. With new tech that's not anywhere near the maturity of bitcoin, I don't think it's worth more than BTC. That's just my 2 cents. Investors probably don't care though because honestly, if the coin value goes up people will buy it and hype it up. To them it's about the money.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:16:25
The Ethereum Foundation controls a huge supply of ETC and therefore they have a lot of influence on the price. On top of that, they own the trademark for Ethereum and can sue ETC. The real question is why is ETC worth anything at all? It's because they stood behind the principal of immutability. That's where ETC differs from ETH and for that, ETC is worth $18 per ETC token, which is really good in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:36:04
There's a difference between fixing the bug versus fixing the bug and revert transactions on the blockchain. We're talking about immutability. ETH went with the option of reversing transactions, which is more than required to fix the issue. In the crypto-currency world, immutability is one of the most important aspects. ETH failed on this aspect, which resulted in the creation of ETC.
I'll just leave this here:
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:09:23
You are correct, things make more now but still, ETH is worth more than BTC. Editing the original post.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:00:26
I believe it changes because it's a rolling basis, now it says 27,075. Still, even with a few less ETH, it's still ~5.5x the value of BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:57:14
Yep. There's already way more ETH than BTC, and there's way more ETH generated per day than BTC. ETH already had a bailout and it's only a 2 year old coin. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:11:54
I don't think people actually evaluate those facts, they just follow along. If price is going up, they buy. Who cares if there's no limit to ETH generated, and there's way more ETH than BT,C and way more ETH produced per day than BTC. Who cares that the ETH already had a hard fork bailout.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:01:25
I agree people shouldn't only hold one coin and it's fine to hold ETH as well. People need to be aware of the pitfalls of ETH as well before they make a financial decision. There's a difference between comparing cryptos to stocks though. The value is stored on the blockchain itself, not really a stock. If Tesla gets hacked or their systems are compromised, sure their stock price would go down but they can easily fix the issue. You don't lose any of your stocks in Tesla if Tesla gets hacked. However, with crypto, you can actually lose "stocks" because it's possible for someone to steal your money, not just the effect it has on the market that your money was stolen.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:16:22
Yes, but the signaling period is not over. Anytime within the next 10 days, antpool or some other miners decide to stop signaling BIP 141. Once they do that, the requirement of 95% blocks to signal for BP 141 would fail and BP 141 would not lock in during this signaling period. So it's not over until the fat lady sings.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:41:24
I think it's easier to manipulate the price if you already have a large sum of ETC, which ETH founders have. They control the price than an outsider that had no ETH to begin with. At least, it'd cost an outsider a lot more to "control" the price because they have to buy in. Any cryptocurrency that attempts to store value should be focusing on security, rate of inflation, and immutability. This isn't really an ideology, it's what's needed for people to have trust in the tech if they put their savings in it. If you're talking about innovation, productivity, etc that's nice and all but are you willing to put your live savings into the newest, most innovative tech?
In terms of security, the attack surface on ETH is much greater because you let anyone execute arbitrary code on their network. They already had issues with a replay attack. They fixed the issue and went further to reverse transactions on the blockchain. 27,615 ETH vs 2,163 BTC created in the last 24 hours. 21 Million BTC will ever be created but ETH has no upper limit.
I know everyone is buying in now and they're making a lot of money but if you look at things long term, I'm more skeptical about ETH than LTC.

To add to that:
Will Coinbase keep UAHF coins for itself?
Coinbase does not intend to support or interact with the UAHF chain. If this were to change, Coinbase would make those coins available for customers to withdraw, not keep them.
So if BCC actually becomes a legitimate alt coin, coinbase will give you your BCC tokens, they will NOT sell it and profit themselves.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:30:43
This is not accurate. If BCH has value coinbase will NOT keep it for themselves and credit it to the account holder. See 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:01:56
When BP 141 actually locks in, I think the price will stabilize but before that, who knows. The signaling period is still 10 days away and requires 95% of blocks to lock in. If a miner decides to screw things up, it's possible they might.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:43:04
The number of coins has a relation to the value per coin, it's based on inflation. If there's more supply and the demand remands the same, then the price of the coin goes down.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:03:57
Marketcap is the movement of coins per day, it's not really about how many coins are generated per day aka inflation. If you look at ETH, there's really no plans of halving. ETH has been around for only 3 years and there's way more ETH than BTC and way more ETH generated per day. If you're investing long term, BTC is a much better choice from an inflation perspective.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:48:59
Sorry, what I meant was that depending on the movement of coins (if there are more buyers than sellers or more sellers than buyers), it determines to price of the coin, for that day. What I'm trying to say is that inflation is a factor.
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:54:40
From a simple supply and demand perspective, 26,205 ETH was mined in the last 24 hours compared to 1,838 BTC. This is 14.257 times more ETH generated per 24 hours than BTC; ETH needs to sustain a very high amount of buyers everyday for the price to remain "stable." ETH is very good at generating hype though so it maybe awhile for people to realize that from a simple understanding of supply and demand, ETH prices are much harder to prop up and grow, especially in the long term.
