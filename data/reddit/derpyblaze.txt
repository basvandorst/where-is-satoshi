Under 18, when one gets limited, I can't do anything about it.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:25:16
I've been through about 4 PayPal accounts :)
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:12:19
Hey, I'm also 15 and the proud owner of 6.6 BTC :). If you have PayPal, you can buy from LocalBitcoins or I buy from various forums for a fee. You'd have to educate your parents about Bitcoin first, if you wanted to convice them.

500 bits
thank you!
appreciate the detailed reponse.
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:55:27
Do you have a PayPal account? 
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:53:37
Can someone explain the block size thing? I don't really understand any of that.
@_date: 2015-05-02 03:08:03
Wow, that's very generous! Bitcoin community is awesome.
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:01:51
time to pack it up boys

Hello world!
@_date: 2015-05-13 12:03:40
Are you talking ~$230-$245 range or just generally $200-$300 range?
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:03:12
Please don't keep your coins in Coinbase. Get a hardware wallet. Look up the Leger wallets, Trezor, and KeepKey wallets. Be free!
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:20:07
More like trip to the ER
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:28:10
Anyone with the file can access your coins. If you get hacked and the file gets hacked, you're done for. Having a hardware wallet, like a KeepKey or Trezor, makes you impossible to hack, unless someone steals the wallet physically.

It's basically just the mobile website in an app, pretty disappointing.

Welcome to the club.

If he's not going to listen to you, he just won't. Let him learn from his mistakes. Be glad you're wiser than him, and won't be losing money. The ignorant stay ignorant. As for him opening accounts under your name/email, you can close them yourself. You have access to your email/account.
@_date: 2016-11-04 11:46:42
I have my KeepKey and my blockchain wallet for spending as well. I have ~2 btc on my blockchain wallet and ~22 on my KeepKey.

Circle for using your debit card.
You probably can't use exchanges, as you need to submit IDs, etc.
I have bought all my Bitcoin with PayPal on forums where I'm a top member, so I never have to worry about scams. Don't fall into the stigma of thinking PayPal and Bitcoin don't mix.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:03:14
It's expensive though. Spamming TXs, pumping BCH out the roof. It all comes with a hefty receipt.
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:26:54
Great to see more people accepting Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:55:55
shut the fuck up you nigger
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:16:50
ayy time to get my speed cube game on.
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:56:02
Considering they can't spell "authorization"...
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:05:04
I only have 8 coins :/
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:51:43
ayy lmao thanks :)
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:02:20
You little shit.
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:37:51
WHEN DOES BTC-E LEAD THE MARKET?
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:33:42
guess no one wants it lmao
@_date: 2015-04-01 04:00:50
I'm working towards 10.
I'm at 7.2 at the moment.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:12:44
I'll just hold onto my 8 BTC for a while.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:52:21
Unfortunately :/ + I'm only 15 + I don't have a job + my parents don't know about my 8 coins. My goal is 10-15 coins. Hard times :\
@_date: 2016-10-22 11:39:46

what a troll
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:03:27
Someone just make a buy order for 305 and it will all be okay :)
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:42:30
Don't worry about it, you made the better choice :)
@_date: 2015-03-12 02:26:50
I buy them off private sellers off forums w/PayPal.
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:32:13
Whatever money I earn online, it goes to bitcoin. I've earned around ~$2,200 and turned it into 7.2 btc c:
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:23:27
I've had two KeepKeys for a few years now. I like the big screen on it, they are just a bit slow on features. A little buggy, but works. I check them every year or so.
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:11:10
Bought some Bitcoin on Coinbase, and they paid a nice fee of $26 because of all the inputs :)
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:21:20
Aww! This is really awesome and made me smile :)
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:32:23
