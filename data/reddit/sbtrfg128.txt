Been wondering about this. Coinbase has that whitelist feature. It seems like a good security measure, but then you are always reusing the same address to withdraw funds. Is this a bad idea?

I read *Confessions of an Economic Hit Man* and *Sapiens* in the summer of 2017. I'd known at Bitcoin prior, but I hadn't done much research. Those two books were pivotal to my "awakening" during the last bull run.

If you don't have bitcoin the King of England can just walk in here anytime he wants and start shoving you around. Do you want that?

That's very unfortunate. Sorry to hear. 
For other community members, Coinbase has 2 features that might have prevented this: vault and address whitelists. Do you all think that activating the vault feature would prevent this type of theft?

How do you test your seed words/private keys? If you have a hardware wallet, can you test the seed without resetting the device?

Keynesian economics is likely far more harmful than Bitcoin mining. If you believe Bitcoin is a revolutionary force against the current global financial system, then the long term benefits may outweigh the short term waste.

I think it happens a lot. Sustained romantic attraction requires some sort of common ground, often this common ground comes in the form of shared culture/background/social circle. You want your partner to be different/distant enough to be interesting, but similar enough to be comfortable.
My cousin and a good friend both married someone from kindergarten. In both cases, they separated by first grade and didn't see each other again until well after college.
Geographical convenience is hugely important in romance, but everyone wants to believe in fate.

Heard of and understand are not the same thing. I think a lot of new members here had heard of bitcoin prior to 2016, but put no real effort into understanding. Others may have understood, but opted not to buy. I have a vivid memory of explaining the use case of bitcoin to family members at Christmas in 2015. I understood the potential and still didn't buy until summer of '17 (small kine regret).
Yes, everyone in developed countries has heard of bitcoin, but the majority of people don't understand or care yet. Another cycle or two could easily change that. I don't think it's that improbable to see another large influx of new capital.

Unfortunately, a lot of people would be more likely to trust this type of coin. It's not consumer-facing though.

Fair. Internet truce. Although I don't think that land's SOV premium will disappear in the near future (or ever), I agree that BTC will cut into that premium because BTC is a sound alternative.

Land as a source or store of value is almost axiomatic. Land has been a source of wealth for nearly all of human civilization. Land can be valuable for a myriad of reasons including agriculture, natural resources, commerce or housing. Land is wealth, and can produce more wealth. Bitcoin may be a black swan style disruptor, but it will not devalue real estate.
Bitcoin is superior in its trustless and borderless transfer capabilities, but even if Bitcoin is the soundest money every created (it is), to say that it will suck-up all the wealth currently tied up in real estate is a claim that requires a lot more support than mine.
There are only 2 situations where private property becomes worthless. In one, Bitcoin is also likely worthless. Pick your dystopian poison. In the other, star-trek communism scenario, land will still hold value, it just wont be traded on the open market in quite the same way, and will probably still be priced in bitcoin. Every civilization that has disregarded the financial value of land (even if that value is arbitrary and imaginary) has been wiped out by a civilization that valued the land or the resources within it.

I don't think BTC can, will, or should suck in or overtake all stores of value. Real estate will always be a SOV. Disregarding space travel, exploration, and exploitation, real estate is finite. Bitcoin is not currently superior to real estate and I doubt it ever will be. It just has a much lower barrier of entry. 
On the plus side, if we are ever in a scenario where you can buy extraterrestrial real estate, BTC seems like a good payment option.

I understand that part. I'm more concerned about device security. Aside from an exchange hack, exchange users also have to worry about SIM swap attacks. Wouldn't a phone wallet be even more vulnerable to this type of identity theft, since the thief has access to one device and potentially all email accounts as well. Do phone wallets all use fingerprint IDs? I have no experience with mobile wallets and was under the impression that they are unsafe.

What is the risk of trying multiple times? Is it just the time/labor factor? Or is there a lockout?

How can a phone wallet be safer than an exchange? If you lose your phone are you toast? What security options exist on a mobile wallet that would be more secure than an exchange wallet?

How do we know they haven't? How many billionaires do you know? We know for a fact that some billionaires are in this space – Mike N, Winkelvi. We also know that some billionaires are bullish and have a small (or undisclosed) amount – Jack Dorsey, Elon. Do we really know the others don't have any? Even as a hedge.

This is my issue as well. Early adopters tend to be more tech savvy than most. I feel the chance of user error is pretty high when moving to a hardware wallet. It's the safer option if you have the knowledge, but comes with its own risks. I fully understand the "not your keys not your bitcoin" argument, but I wonder if the community underestimates user error because it's reported as a trickle of posts over time, whereas a hack is a  large wave. i intend to move my admittedly modest amount coin off exchanges once I have enough, but lack of confidence in my technical abilities has prevented me from doing so, especially when I see people recommend that I physically check the nano hardware to make sure it hasn't been tampered with. I'd imagine coinbase is one of the more secure exchanges out there, but I understand that no exchange/custodial service is 100% secure.

Why? If the network is secure and people are using it shouldn't it be as useful as BTC?

Not sure PTS failed because of Turing test. Bots can also manipulate PPC, CPM, and pretty much any other metric. PTS was just less efficient than other performance marketing tactics. Not sure BAT solves this problem totally, but people are a lot more concerned about privacy than they were in 90s.

You have to realize the problems with our current (non-gold backed) fiat money before you can see any value in a decentralized network of hard money. If you don't see any problem with the current system, then Bitcoin  seems worthless. I try to be as skeptical as possible, and I understand it might fail, but to me, the "real" value of Bitcoin could not be more clear. I want to shake most people.

If we use it as transactional cash, rather than a universal store of wealth "cash," then yes, those fees would be a problem if we didn't scale. However, that's assuming that it is the only currency in the world, as opposed to the primary universal currency.

If you purchase a new ledger S (new and direct from ledger), and transfer from coinbase pro to ledger using secure wifi, are there any risks to be aware of? Does browser matter? Are there any common laptop malware programs that could cause issues?

Thanks. User name hopefully does not check out. To be clear, with a copy paste virus, I would actually be able to see the different (malicious) address in  coinbase, right? It's not an invisible switch on the back end?
