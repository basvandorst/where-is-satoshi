The feds aren't incompetent fools. They shut silk road down for a reason, and they did it when they did for a reason.
I've never said "all government stuff is bad." The private sector is pretty gnarly, too. Look at Peter Thiel. And then there's [this](

Pretty sure, see [this]( Silk road shutdown two days after the "government shut down"? Probably not a coincidence, they could have done this a while ago.
Even before this big money started to move in support of bitcoin. Peter thiel dropped 8 mil earlier this year. Some hedge fund people are expressing interest.
Now silkroad is down, 'legitimizing' bitcoin in the eyes of many. A lot of people are speculating that the shutdown was good for bitcoin. What's going to happen if the u.s. is called on its debts?

Are you sure this isnt what the feds want?

Yeah. I don't think they're trying to shut down bitcoin, especially if [this](  is any indication.

What's their end game? The war on drugs has never actually been about preventing the circulation of drugs - just look at pharma and how extensive cia drug trufficking has been.
They aren't blundering idiots that finally managed to shut silk road down. They didn't need to capture or arrest anyone to do it. They knew about it and let it continue, until now.

I don't think the SR seizure is significant in terms of the amount seized. It's drawn a lot of attention to bitcoin and will be seen by many as legitimizing it.
I've been following snowden' revelations closely and I remain skeptical. Two of his stories in particular strike me as off: "dna ev bin laden captured in 2011" and "the nsa targeted google." He's said almost nothing about the cia despite having worked for them and I can see how both of these stories benefit them. The first, 'cos that's their story... the second, because google has been funded by and working with the cia in various ways since its creation.
Tor was started by the navy and receives over 60% of its funding from the feds. The creator of bitcoin remains anonymous.
