but....but....I was told you could still perform a chargeback after 6 months on a credit card in this sub
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:31:08
And how often does this happen?  Less than 1% of 1% of cases?
@_date: 2015-06-29 11:28:47
No. It's about greece pushing up the bitcoin price.

Apparently now is a mod of Buttcoiners have a plant in the core dev team!
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:37:59
Remember Mark Karpeles has never been convicted in court so he is totally innocent, just how like Ulbricht never hired those hitmen because it wasnt proved in court.
@_date: 2015-06-12 01:51:09
Yea cause New York is totally like North Korea with its mass executions and rampant starvation
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:25:05
How so? If they had bought long ago they'd have seen there value shrink by over 50%.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:49:38
Thats a bold faced lie, they won't put you in prison for attempted suicide. They do force you to get psychiatric care in a hospital.
@_date: 2015-05-28 18:17:50
No but you see there is no such thing as Intellectual Property so f*ck you got mine!
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:34:23
Well then I guess Mark Karpeles is totally innocent since hes never actually been tried or convicted on anything right?
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:48:09
That wasn't my point. If you are unable to defend yourself for any reason, who will bring me to justice? Or do I just get to walk away scott free?
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:33:16
People in this sub will refute that all day long, but his legal team never disputed it, even when it came up for sentencing recommendations to the judge.

I don't see how more people associating Bitcoin with ransomware helps or is progressing.

So if I bottle poison and instead sell it as " Health Fixer-Upper - Cures all Ailments" and someone dies, they're still accountable?

Oh yes please tell me how DPR is like the MLK of today.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:26:09
Yea, totally risk sitting in an 8x8 cell for the rest of your life like Ross so you can potentially "change the world".
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:35:47
so I can sell poison for a living and not be held accountable for anything that happens? I take it back, I like your world.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:30:55
You're right, I don't have the balls to start a drug empire on the Dark Net and potentially risk life in a cage to "change the world". 
I bet you're the same kind of person who equates what Ross did with people like Rosa Parks and MLK?
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:31:57
So if I come by and murder your family, I get to just walk free? Cool, I like that kind of world.

You mean like the room mates of the one guy he tried to have killed? Where he said (if they get in the way, kill them too).

A hardfork wouldn't kick in until at least 75% (or whatever % XT has), so the Bitcoin network wouldn't be split in half.

Don't worry guys, the FREE MARKET will sort this out, because rational actors would not ruin their reputation by pulling an exit scam. Its much more profitable to keep running than take all the money and run  *rolls eyes*

Thats not an answer to merchants accepting Bitcoin who are unsure of which chain to accept transactions from.

If you only accept Bitcoin, why are you using Bitpay at all?
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:50:07
Not really, because by default most wallets include a transaction fee you can't change or remove, and the average novice user will not be able to know how to send a fee without a transaction. 
The same way Instant is misleading, we've all seen the issue of double spends before the first confirmation. It should be "Fast" and not instant.
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:32:56

Established banks DO want this. You think banks are horrible now? Could you imagine how much worse they would be without regulations?

So many statists in this thread.
@_date: 2015-09-20 02:02:12
Everyone except Mirceau Poopshoot and his nutbar followers.
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:46:53
Rational Actors in a free market like profit.
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:51:22
More like gopher
@_date: 2015-10-12 03:56:48
The OP wasn't just referring to the Bitcoin subreddit 
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:56:34
Except for all the threads on this forum about sending btc to an incorrectly typed address
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:40:08
I agree with you on that but my point was that even this forum is littered with threads about that
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:02:01
Dictators are OK if the quality of life is OK?
Well then in that case you all have no reason to bitch about the US spying on you and increasing regulations cause the quality of life is just fine
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:46:10
Isn't this basically saying since we can never stop people from drunk driving, we shouldn't bother to try and curb it at all?
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:58:48
First off that's BS, the whole country hated him and so did his neighbors. His erratic and belligerent behavior was well documented. 
I bet you think Hitler was also totally smeared by the West too
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:22:44
Examples in the Bitcoin space?
@_date: 2015-10-29 07:52:50
People frothing about Visa using a blockchain other than Bitcoins is proof that nobody cares about the technology, just becoming rich.
@_date: 2015-10-08 08:30:59
Why is it that everyone who has a negative opinion of Bitcoin gets handwaved off with "the clearly don't get Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2015-10-01 18:29:17
Comments like this are why people think Bitcoin and this community in general are a bunch of nutcases.

He'd get more donations if he promised 150% returns in 30 days, but kept the money anyway.
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:53:52
Holy shit is this serious? Are we going to ignore all the people Ghadaffi mass murdered and tortured? Literal horror stories from the school girls he kept as sex slaves?
You people are terrible
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:02:14
Paging to shill for backpage
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:21:28
So how do you explain the rampant scamming and amateur-hour setups of the current Bitcoin space and exchanges?
@_date: 2015-10-11 22:52:00
HAIL STATE-AN!
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:22:02
Oh geeze, you people. Why would he bother doing it as a lifetime thing? Hes not saving more than 2-3% in processing fees by using BTC anyway
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:49:20
Because its ridiculous to think the police would bother going in with guns on a raw milk operation. How can anyone believe they would actually bother to perform a raid as opposed to having one or two guys show up and be like "hey cut it out"?
@_date: 2015-10-25 16:45:43
Or maybe the fact that the Bitcoin technology is horribly inefficient, a typo will cause you to lose money, and can't handle more than a few tps? 
No clearly it must be because all these haters are statists.
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:57:52
lmao that people believe this
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:21:01
17 is legal in most states. Try again.
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:54:21


Because we all know how super accurate Coinmap is /s
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:48:46
Who cares.
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:26:55
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:07:36
I think you would do better to purge out the crazy evangelists along with the "trolls". You know, the Bitcoiners who proudly state that they call up and harass places who refuse to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-12 16:45:20
Of course, no empathy for him, just LOL Sux. Way to prove OPs point
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:31:14
A typo won't cause me to lose my life savings and get "Sorry for your loss"
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:21:01
Safer in Russia? The US isn't putting you in jail for years on end simply for trading something silly like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:51:09
Pokemon Cards aren't money either, but years ago I could definitely pay some people with them.
@_date: 2015-10-22 02:54:29
Tell that to Ross Ulbrichts coins
@_date: 2015-10-14 09:32:52
The fact that people believe they would come in guns blazing over raw milk instead of a violent cocaine ring
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:02:02
Hahah. This sub love to preach a NAP until they get upset
@_date: 2015-10-09 22:48:13
No, didn't you hear?! Steamium is Bitcoins KILLER APP!
@_date: 2015-10-07 15:01:15
Yea just like the Greece crash did....oh wait.
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:26:20
Thanks we needed a 10th thread about the same thing
@_date: 2015-10-01 18:19:40
Well I guess now Jeff does care about the price of Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-12 16:46:18
Oh I got it. Mass adoption any day now!
@_date: 2015-10-29 12:41:55
That's not necessarily true. Nothing happened with Bitcoin when Greece went down the toilet
@_date: 2015-10-25 02:54:56
Because the whole community does this crap, they have some expectation of huge discounts for using Bitcoin like people owe them.
@_date: 2015-10-25 01:49:16
Yea that's totally worth a lifetime discount as opposed to something reasonable like a few months
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:59:46
The price is up like $20 and you're claiming victory?
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:57:45
I'm asking for examples of your point in the Bitcoin spacd
@_date: 2015-10-25 14:39:05
Oh cool, another "People who don't 'get' Bitcoin must not understand it" thread.
Because everyone who dislikes Bitcoin just doesn't understand it, only people in this sub understand it.
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:28:54
This can't be right. Russia is a bastion of freedom unlike the United States. That's why Snowden hid there
@_date: 2015-10-27 00:24:21
So then blame those states, its not a US wide thing
@_date: 2015-10-25 01:48:25
Nobody cares about the seller. It's all about the consumer
