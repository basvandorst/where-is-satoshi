Were any of the firearms or paraphernalia purchased with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:20:13
Maybe for more obscure currencies?
As a Canadian I can get Euro's, Peso's, USD, Pounds for cheap, I have never paid more than 2-3% spread plus a $5 fee from my bank for accessing the international network to take them out at a ATM machine in whatever country I visit.

Tell him model trains are dead, you can build infinite train sets in computer simulations for cheap.

I dunno, I have never had a wallet stolen but I have lost my few micro bitcoins when some online service up and disappeared (was linked to on the sidebar of this sub at some point). There are a lot of stolen bitcoins out there and I know many people without stolen RL wallets over several decades.
I feel like I am much less fucked relying on fiat over bitcoin for travel if my wallet were to get stolen. I distribute backups for cash when I travel. I keep emergency money in the sole of my shoe, I have travelers cheques hidden in my luggage and I keep my cards and ID on my person at all times sans shower/swimming. I also have several online bank accounts that can also be reached by phone for emergencies, I don't know what the equivalent for bitcoin would be.

Haven't regular ATM's killed those already? With all the international networks like Plus, Maestro etc, you can take out currency of the home country for whatever rate your bank charges which should be lower than any exchange kiosk.

I only see one musician on the list, Johnny Cash.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:46:32
Too much insider information and too easily manipulated for this to work. If it was possible, people who are better connected would rip you off.
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:21:10
Why would bitcoin need an ATM?

isn't xhamster free?

I guess you have a much better safety net. In north america if you go paycheck to paycheck without emergency funds, and something goes wrong, you're in big trouble. I also assume you are a young white male on reddit and can afford to take some risks.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:08:03
Isn't the volume of trades the crucial thing? When people are actually using bitcoin and exchanging it, I will be interested in it. I am very curious how this deflationary concurrency will fulfill the role of a currency.
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:22:07
but if your wallet gets hacked while you're abroad you are fucked.
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:44:22
Isn't the problem for bitcoin that the initial rate was basically equal to the cost of electricity used to mine the coins?
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:45:38
If you have to wait for your paycheck, are you sure you should be dumping money into bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:17:36
Yeah and my entire garage full of beanie babies is worthless now...
@_date: 2014-06-09 20:36:53
Yeah my Peso was Philipines, I got great rates all over SE Asia through TD and plus network.
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:10:17
electricity and bitcoin are so tightly tied together. Anyone mining bitcoin will have a huge electrical bill, how convenient.

Or is it the propositions to legalize some drugs?
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:44:24
Does this mean, if you try to sell a bitcoin in India, you will get scammed and end up with counterfeit or not legal tender?
@_date: 2016-11-13 17:23:25
Yeah cause of inflation, $1million USD but like 350 in Euro's

Carbon footprint of bitcoin vs. gold mining?
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:27:23
Cool! thanks for the up to date and informed answers!
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:35:42
Thanks so much! This is what I was afraid of. I wanted to know if that information was missing from the bigquery bitcoin blockchain data for a reason, or oversight. I was trying to gauge how hard it would be to recreate the data myself by looking into the raw blockchain.

For $5000 it isn't really necessary to get to international airspace.

Cash-out everyone!

Doesn't this just show how dated and backwards a physical product is for bitcoin? It's a digital currency.
@_date: 2015-03-28 11:53:23
To be fair mycelium sounds like a psychoactive fungus.
@_date: 2015-03-28 11:57:07
Who would ship a flash drive now-a-days when data can be sent over the net? It kind of demonstrates how backwards the product is in the first place.

just testing the bot.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:01:57
My mistake. I read it initially as telling people to hold their bitcoins for two years if they want to be called true believers.
...so I'm not criticizing your post, but I think what I said still stands.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:41:05
Downvoting this is a serious [reddiquette]( breach for this subreddit. I hope you all realize that you cannot downvote the truth to increase the value of your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:55:53
Hoarding isn't believing. The point of bitcoin is to actively trade in it and legitimize it as a currency.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:42:13
What bitcoin needs as market for profiteering as OP is suggesting is a method for short-selling bitcoin to allow the price to reach it's "true" relative value compared to other currencies.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:39:04
This sounds like advice from one gambling addict to another, not the cheerleader of a new unregulated currency looking for legitimacy.
@_date: 2013-02-19 15:42:41
you're going to meet the best kinds of people.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:54:26
you haven't made or lost any money until you sell. And if I understand bitcoin, most people won't sell anyway.
@_date: 2013-07-26 13:31:05
it's a political aim but it can fit into almost any ideology. Cut healthcare costs, protect the environment, stop reliance on foreign oil, etc. appeal to people of many different ideologies.
EVERYTHING is political, from your breakfast cereal to your internet use.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:16:32
Bitcoins are worthless!
@_date: 2013-08-01 12:31:56
I'm not going to adopt bitcoin because everyone is "nice." I will do it if I want to make money or protect my money. I already use gov't fiat everyday and it's directly linked to a bunch of asshole bankers and inflation targeting gov't hacks. But right now it works for me.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:59:35
cause you can sell them for local goods at the site of the disaster when electricity and telecoms are knocked out?
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:15:11
I don't think the gov't of China would smile upon a currency they cannot manipulate.
