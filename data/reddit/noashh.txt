4 days ago I made a  email account with a strong unique password. 2 days later, after waking up, my google mail account, which I used to send/recieve emails via that new gmx.com account (pop3/imap), told me that my login data doesnt work anymore. This might be relevant to the satoshi mail hack, maybe  the hacker got access to more than 1 gmx account. 
Edit: Luckily I didnt use the account for nothing important, just to send/recieve a few emails and set it as my bitcointalk email. I was able to login to the bitcointalk account, change my password and email, so I think the hacker (if there was one) did not access my bitcointalk account.

You make no sense, lie and just want to troll. Disrespect.
Edit: Are you icebreaker?

Interesting interview! For quick access to the NXT asset exchange you can go to secureae.com, a web based NXT AE-only client that allows to buy directly with bitcoin. Before you buy make sure you get what you want, check nxtforum.org for more information on most of the assets.

I am very much used to see everything, from legit criticism (ie. about commit messages beeing "test" most of the time) to totally absurd accusations like "James never finished anything. Okay, MGW, but that doesnt work.". It is absurd because I am very familiar with SuperNET &amp; James' work and products. Like when you just flew around the world and then you meet someone who tells you the earth is flat and accuses you of beeing a cheerleader for that idiot Magellan. 
I was there when Joshua Zeidner aka Bluemeanie went from supportive friendly person to crazy weirdo who called the employers of people working on NXT. I read the comments that suggested James and the people that work with him will be gone shortly after supernet started. 
When you search long enough you find people that believe whatever you want, no matter how absurd. Btw, according to the laws of north korea using reddit is a crime, guess that makes you a criminal. Tsts.

He is a trustworthy person and not a lier &amp; troll like you are.

He is lying, you wont find any proof for any wrongdoing of jl777. Two of his projects (BTCD, Iguana) have their own sub-forums at bitco.in and Gavin Andresen mentioned project "iguana" ( not long ago.
