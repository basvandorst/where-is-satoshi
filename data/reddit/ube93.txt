Its implied, clearly you have no sense of a conversation and how it proceeds.

So, in a way, Mt. Gox defeated the entire purpose of Bitoins?

Just a question, why would Satoshi need to hide. He didn't do anything illegal or wrong, or am I missing something?

Well, it might just be an honest mistake. when you are sending the bitcoins to a particular address, you may corrupt it on the way, or something like that.

I am not such an idiot that I thought it was actually a flaw. I just wanted to know what the mechanism is. And if making a sarcastic comment strokes your ego that much then please write "/s" five more times and jack off.

But thats an huge implementation flaw. Has it been addressed since? Any body can destroy the system at anytime then!

It is said that half of the money is still accounted for. How can this happen? Considering everyone is supposed to know where it is. There was also a scenario where bitcoins were lost because they were sent to addresses that were invalid with no private keys. How did that happen? Shouldnt the system have detected it?

Well just to expand on the second point,  why should Bitcoin have a rather large value in 2140? Since more bitcoins will be available, shouldn't its value diminish? 
The other argument I am trying to make is, since the number of miners can be infinite, so the total sum of all the transaction fees in the network will be distributed infinitesimaly. As a result of which each miner will get a very small fee. That could make the whole system unviable. What then?

I dont understand what you have against interns. So what if I am. I fail to see why you want to display this elitist attitude. If you dont want to answer anything please dont answer. Because there are others who will without being a narcissist about it. And I am learning about it, and when I get a doubt I post it. And if people feel that it is stupid, they downvote it. This is how reddit works. I know you think underplaying others makes you look cool. Well then be cool because I cant help it.

But they are lost! :'( 
The poor guy who lost them will be sad!

I know you are trying to be cool and smart, so I wont hurt your ego. But on a more serious note, if it is not then what gives it its exchange value? The people's perception of value? What determines the fluctuations of its exchange rates?

Thanks for the nice and concise idea!
