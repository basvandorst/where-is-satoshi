Does that mean that someone is now a BILLIONAIRE? Satoshi Billionaire, that is.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:28:15
Did you really just ask if you should wait for the price to go up BEFORE you buy? you see how this logic is flawed, right?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:46:01
Realistically, we don't expect anyone to come in wanting to pay in bitcoin for maybe an entire year. But adding another method of payment is never a bad thing. Before last year he never took credit/debit because of the fees....Solution: BITCOINS!

Nice 100 bits @_date: 2014-02-28 19:42:14
We will once we are fully ready to go. A lot of contracts must be changed.
I will be sure to add in any press that we hopefully will get!

Lets think about how much the price could have gone up since he received those 89 btc. If I bought them @ $120 a coin, not really gonna care about an $88.9 drop... All about prespective, my friend
Besides when we arrive on the moon $$$ aren't gonna matter anyways :)
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:35:01
What state was Satoshi posting from? and how did you find that out?
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:50:55

I don't understand why strippers get mad at me when I tip in monopoly money, I mean.....Are those tits real? I didn't think so!
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:37:53
I'm sure it will be on their site soon. I'll edit in the link once I can find one!
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:52:47
My SO tipped the waitress at Denny's...
No need to tip the workers at firehouse subs...
And my good friend is taking care of any bill/tip left from Chili's tonight (He works at Chili's)
**Edit: If someone would let me tip them in btc I would gladly give 25% gratuity, but all I get are dumb looks when I ask about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-28 21:21:58
I see no where on the site where they say they accept bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:02:19

Any word on Texas progress?
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:45:38
I'm curious to know what state you live in and what kind of LE it was? (Local PD, Sheriff, Constable, or a Fed)
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:04:57
They get 8 letters in NC... In Texas we only get 6 with a rare occasion to buy 7 at a premium.
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:11:19
Can you release info on Texas' status? I know people are itching in the Lone Star State!

People are going to make mistakes. I agree we are so early on, such measures are not yet in place to help prevent this from happening, but they will. With money in the hundred of million if not BILLIONS being pumped in to new, innovative ideas and businesses, user protection will be a key aspect over the coming years. 
Ultimately, you can't fix stupid...and people are gonna screw up no matter how "protected" you try and make them.

You said earlier Mark stole others money via credit card fraud. If he has done it before, can you really automatically say no he couldn't have stolen all of the BTC?
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:37:16
WU is the coinbase of fiat. If both end users have coinbase, your money is sent without conformation because it's not broadcasted on blockchain (ie. Don't have to be confirmed by middle man.) WU users are both using western union not different banks. If they both used BOA the 3-4 days isn't neccessary.

Anyone else feel like parts of Bitcoin is completely over their head? 
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:51:17
Only in do people consider 75-150% profit a small boost...

Two years. Sounds like a pretty sweet place (as far as jails go) if he will be tweeting from jail. Could have received up to 30 years.

I will start the bidding at 1 BTC and will pick up!
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:38:09
I don't see any option to pay in bitcoin at the actual check out page. and clicking the "we accept bitcoin" did nothing but take me to the top of the page
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:55:24
Well, if Satoshi has a million, then it would put the current count under 13 million. He is correct that not even 13 million people could own 1 btc.
