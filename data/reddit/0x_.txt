What about it?

I dont understand why spying on the exchange traffic should affect anything in the blockchain? Its all public isn't it?

But the context of the comments is the takedown of silkroad. Theres nothing about dealings with MtGox (or any cloudfront protected exchange) that would have yielded identities or broke the anonymity of Tor using vendors or admins.


And whoever downvoted my comment or your comment probably thought about that as deeply as "its bad, and you're downplaying it, shill". Because mention conspiracy and dumb people piggy back onto it without employing any critical thinking about the technical aspects of what can and cannot be done via the specific theoretical attack being talked about (owning cloudfront in this case).
Im not even saying DDoS attacks on the Silkroad website were not instrumental in finding the silkroad server(s) (then exploiting it). Im just saying that has nothing to do with cloudfront. Nothing at all.

Those coins are kept on a computer permanently on Tor. They are the normal wallets!? I dont understand your logic.


What are you even saying? That knowing a wallets address lets you...? What? I dont even.


Well, its all traceable, it just requires extreme amounts of analysis to have a shot.
I dont know too much about the efficacy of tumbling, but i'd put the NSA on being the likely best in the world at analyzing tumbled coins for leads, but even then, you assume that the admins are cashing out through their clearnet IP addresses/major exchanges... thats very very unlikely.


Its in clear text on blockchain.info theres no use for cloudfront spying. They can and will subpoena the exchange for the details if they find a final wallet that resolves to an exchange.


Your mixing things up again. Tor has nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol. Transparently porxying your bitcoin client through Tor will anonymize your clients wallet though. And hidden services are like a needle in a haystack for any intelligence agency to find, i think they need huge DDoS to light up the servers, and this only counts for big webservers with many users, not bitcoin wallets.

You're right. You're fucking retarded. You're mixing everything up to have an opinion on something you dont understand. Its pointless talking to you.

All vendors and admins on silkroad would be only receiving coins through Tor, and "laundering"/tumbling anything withdrawn into IRL assets.


Its Tor, so the IP of the wallet changes every ten minutes, and the IP at the time of appearance in the blockchain belongs to the Tor network.


I dont want to be a dick, but thats the problem with conspiracy theory, its usually no more than a hypothesis, without data or even **knowledge** of the kind of data, if there had been data sought out, to turn a hypothesis into a **theory.**
Its jumping at shadows mostly.
