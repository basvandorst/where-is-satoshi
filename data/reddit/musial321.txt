Lots of futures contracts are settled with cash and can be completed without either party actually owning the asset.

@_date: 2017-03-18 22:42:52
Lol gonna have to keep reminding myself that after buying at an avg of 1100
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:53:16
I'm thinking of buying the dip. How much more dipping do you think we have though???

Inevitable is a strong word.

Hodlers will keep. Non hodlers never had any in the first place. Doesn't matter what shitty titty WSJ has to say about it. The worst that can happen is more publicity
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:09:39
Any publicity is good publicity

Wasn't trying to make it sound a personal demand. I'm talking about the community in general. The miners know its gotta happen, the owners of bitcoin know its gotta happen, but everyone is holding each other back.

Your grandpa, your neighbor, your relatives, your fucking pet dog is talking about bitcoin. Word on the street is there are only so many bitcoin to go around.

1st day of holding at 1250 and I freaked out when it dropped to 850.
Now I all I see in times like this is people offering up cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:42:12
BITCOIN IS DED!!!!!!!1111111!!!!

It's not going to 1,300. Whales will buy back in before then.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:38:01
Bought back in at 1800 and realized what a horrible mistake I had made before
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:59:15
I second this
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:47:30
Implying you cant look at the blockchain and that people haven't looked into it
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:12:46
Less expensive than next year though.
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:31:14
I'm shook
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:00:33
Okay why is reducing block time slightly a bad idea?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:58:16
Lol sell it for cuckbucks and stay poor then
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:19:13
LOL not even close. They got around 60 grand from it. That's not enough to even put a dent in the backlog
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:23:06
