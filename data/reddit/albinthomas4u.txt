There is one more way to buy Bitcoins. 
Ie By selling GOLD to  
They accept Gold for Bitcoins. So people can buy Gold and exchange them for Bitcoin.

Its possible. 
And that's what we call as a bubble- 'the speculation bubble'. If all of us speculate that its going to be worth $610, we will keep buying Bitcoins. Increase in demand will proportionally push the price. Finally we all dump it and we call it 'bad times of bitcoin', 'bitcoin network hacked'. 
Just don't go by a single tweet.

We can't directly agree on this. Most of the writers in this so called financial magazines are just plain followers of Bitcoin. They don't even appreciate the value of bitcoin, nor do they seriously follow it. All they see it $8 increased and so Bitcoin is gaining. 
I believe Bitcoin prices are becoming stable, like a currency and yes it could shoot up. Following are some of the reasons that i feel is important. 
- Over paste 2 weeks, a lot of major players in the market started accepting Bitcoins.
-Eventhough overstock reported millions in loses through Bitcoins, its never planning to quit this idea as a whole. 
- Cloudways started accepting Bitcoin
- Most importantly recently 'everyone', including banks want to use the Blockchain technology of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is out of the silk road bubble. Don't see Bitcoin as a way to earn money. It's a new tech and is not going to replace paper currency anytime soon. 
I would suggest all Bitcoin lovers to follow the news about Bitcoin very closely and relate it to price increase. 
Yes Greece is also a reason, but not alone!

I think currently investing in Bitcoin makes lot of sense of people of Greece. Exiting from Euro will simply cause huge inflation in Greece. It is obvious that Government will run out of cash and strict capital controls will be imposed. 
People should invest an affordable 25% of their savings in Bitcoin, considering its volatility. This will be a safe bet.
