exactly! guess we will just have to wait and see what happens

Right, I see your point. Bitcoin after hard fork will no longer be "Bitcoin" as we know it. But then the question is: does that matter? "Ethereum" today is no longer the same "Ethereum" as it was pre-fork, but do investors, users, developers, or enterprises care enough for this to matter? Just trying to think hard about this...no pun intended

Right. The point I was trying to make was that this may actually be a good thing. For example ETC now has its own monetary policy and several development efforts. They've said that if ETH implements PoS they will sit back and wait to see how well it works before implementing into ETC. And both ETH and ETC are trading at much higher values and the aggregate participation of all parties (users, developers, merchants, enterprises) is higher than it was pre-fork...

100% troll. Too many delicious red herring hooks from the 08 crisis which Satoshi mentions to the West Coast stereotype to the precision of the house value and # of bitcoin bought. But entertaining nonetheless thx!

I don't get why someone would still short. Is it because they believe there will be some short term snowball effect? Because we all know what's gonna happen in the long (read: 6+ months) timeframe.
