Ok, really interesting.
Thanks a lot

Assuming no change in price and number of transaction : will miners not try to compensate lower income by rewards with fees?
I am not expert but seems plausible to me. Am I wrong?

Even Carlos/Bitconnect could be ok with this stress test.

Great, I did not know that honestly.
I did not research the real reason after this period so I was still the idea (at the time was the mainstream opinion) that miners did not evaluate on purpose transactions with low fees.
Good to know even if late, thanks.

Yes, of course.
I was thinking more about the problem of late 2017. Senders choosed to pay high fees not for charity.
Contest and market is different now, but maybe a  similar event can happen again.

it is the wrong way if thinking if bitcoin wants to replace fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-14 12:11:00
Sorry but it my opinion, wrong or right.
I do not want so much concentration in china at any level, also pools should have good distribution
For my job I need to source row material and we try as much as possible to source internationally to lower the risks.
You do not want have oil only from russia or saudi, it should be the same here.
Just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-10-14 04:13:19
The today distribution is a problem, that's for sure.

thanks for the answer!
it makes sense.
Do you see improvements in the technology to solve this kind of issue?
I mean, do you think we could have this kind of issue also in the near future or it is something more related to the present?
I think that bitcoin has a big chance to succeed if it will accepted by normal people in a relative short time. Do we have a rough estimation for the time required to build the tech for non-tech people?
Very interesting anyway!

2/3 years seems fine to me to make the tech totally stable. I would not wait more for the project, maybe it is just my old-economy background but better not to wait too much for day-to-day adoption for a new project development.
It is true that it is something completly new and revolutionary, it can be different.
Interesting, thanks

thank you

Why do the people use indicators and analysis of a market completly different?
You find in youtube tons of analysis, does it make sense?
This is my question......
@_date: 2019-12-01 12:31:05
Fuck, I read your experience....
Sorry about that.
Technology does not look ready to me, your advises too complicated for common people.
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:22:21
Question: do you people would use such station?
I think if you are into bitcoin you will never transfer your fiat here, right?
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:42:12
I would prefer less concentration of miners in china anyway.
The role of miner is my biggest concern about the future of the technology.
I know that they are necessary but I do not like the stats now, especially for the pools.
I do not think that Satoshi would like the idea that solo-mining is almost impossible today.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:44:32
Yeah, custodial are easy but would you store all your money on a custodial wallet?
It is very unsafe in my opinion and we need a third party like we need the bank for fiat, not really the solution for the future.
@_date: 2019-12-08 09:41:41
Of course.
However tech analysis can help a lot in the risk assessment for the stock market.
They are the standard practice today because they work, the probability to succeed with these indicators is higher than without.
The same indicators are 100% useless for crypto, they do not work if you do the math. At least this is my conclusion.
