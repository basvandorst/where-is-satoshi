is that true? I thought the shared secret is only revealed to the browser during enrollment? Can someone confirm that?
I have, of course, already re-done all my 2FA keys.

Yes - using google authenticator, not sms.

My ticket was escalated to their Risk Management team and they even clarified their rule on not sharing this information with me. 
"Lastly, I’d like to provide a little insight as to why we do not offer IP’s upon user request. This has to do with a multitude of security policies we’ve set in place, but is mainly a safeguard in the event a user’s account ever is compromised. In the event this were to occur, a user may not only be able to view the sensitive information stored in our on-site tickets but then use that information how ever he likes to socially engineer his way into other secure services a user may have."
I can understand why such a policy exists, but surely there should be an exception for instances like this. When I asked for them to at least confirm it was a NEW login location, they also refused to provide that information.

They won't and I've asked them 5+ times. They claim its a site-wide policy to protect account holders from future social engineering if their nitrogen accounts are compromised as support tickets are saved permanently on-site. It's a ridiculous excuse for not providing the IPs and I found it infuriating.
I even asked them just to clarify that the IP(s) that accessed my account that night was NOT my usual login location and they refused to do that.

I've sent you an email. A bit sad it took posting a thread for this to even be offered as an option but I hope you can help by providing me more information about what actually happened. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:19:42
I definitely have not accessed the site via link and have always typed it in. Since I don't have any email attached to the site I've never had any reason to click a link. 
Also just wanted to clarify for sure nobody else had access to my phone. I live alone and it was on my nightstand when I woke up where I left it. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:34:24
You're correct. Also, even if my phone was compromised by itself, this would still leave the hacker without my username and password. They would need to both keylog/otherwise compromise one of my computers as well as gain access to my phone (from what I understand). 
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:48:41
My computers are locked at night but no it is not possible anyone accessed them. As I said I live alone and nobody had physical contact with any of my devices during the time the breach occurred.
I agree with you, of course and I do frequently move funds off the site when my balance crosses certain thresholds. But due to the confirmation restrictions on poker balances you can end up missing many games if you're constantly waiting on confirmations before you can play. It is a calculated risk most high stakes gamblers are forced to take and are comfortable with. 
edit: posted to thanks

I was told by support that Cloudflare indicated to them that they were not affected. In addition, shouldn't this not affect my 2FA secret as it was set year(s) ago before the vulnerability existed? 
The balance was fairly large. I don't think it adds anything to the discussion to state an amount. With that being said, there are certainly larger accounts (more "worth" it) on the site.

Nope, no teamviewer installed on either machine.
