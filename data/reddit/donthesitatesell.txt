At times like this, 2999 seems like a certainty more than just a vague theoretical possibility.
As your broker i advise you to take it

I will repeat one, and gauge your unesteemed reaction.
Money must have one of the following:
1. Intrinsic value
2. Redemption value
Gold coins have (1) and dollar has (2).
Bitcoin has neither, which means its ass is grass.
Now let's see if your response is the usual "You are a child and get paid very small amount for FUD. Bitcoin is a decentrilized hash ledgerchain."

The people voted for the 2008 bailout.
Namely they had the opportunity to throw the government out in late 2008 and 2010 and 2012 and they kept Obama.

Your labor is a wastage out the window.
The market is trying to tell you to switch your job to a Shoe Polisher

See, you just repeated your Idiotic sentence which you normally use.
That is why I'm a billionaire and you're a hundredaire on a good day

The whole word HODL is extremely childish.
I understand it stems from some drunken idiot, but think about it: Any of the other 999 million instruments can also be "hedl."
i.e. "I don't think I'll sell the house. I'll HODL for now." "I recommend you HODL the Oracle shares."
OK So if holding is a ubiquitous action that's been employed for centuries for everything, why make a big deal out of it?
The only explanation is that Clueless Children think the universe started with them and their particular power ranger.

The way things store value, is that they have it.
But if something has no value, then it can't store it.
That is the Achilles' heel of BTC.
Similarly when something has no value, it won't be adopted as a payment currency. Namely, vendors don't enjoy giving up merchandise for "nothing of value" (BTC).
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:24:52
Yeah but, why are sellers Accepting bitcoin?
Only and only because they think they can resell it higher.
In absence of that, they have no use for it!
Libertarians are embarrassing themselves if they call for a coin with no intrinsic value.

Fucking A, I follow Peter Schiff in all matters crypto.

The following happens.
Someone makes a chart where 00.00 and 00.01 are separated by 5 inches, and $10,000 and 20,000 are separated by 4 inches.
And the point of the chart is that bitcoin is constantly shooting way up, until this day.
Then someone says: "Hey, your chart is a little crooked there hoss."
And the reply is always: "It's a logarhythmic log chart, dimwit. You are so uneducated, it's a logarithm you see."

They were also Rent-Seekers i believe is the word.
"Hey pleb, check out my Lamborghini lel. You will NEVER have access to the 21 million club of monopolists. I do!"

ikr I've only knocked down your family's net worth by 96% since winter.
There is more to go

And that is a problem because why. It dilutes the Windfall Monopoly that you expected to bathe in.

Good question, but one you should have researched before inventing Bitcoin and disparagingly calling others nocoiners.
What gives fiat money value is that it's a get-out-of-jail coupon for taxes.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:39:34
IRS doesn't accept non-dollars for taxes, but at the same time they are probably allowed to do Liquidation Fire Sales of everything you own (couch, parakeet, BTC)

I was surprised that AAAAAAAAA videos started very early, like at $13,000
I knew bitcoin would go to zero, but I thought AAAAAAAAA videos about Wojak would begin later in the crash.

Raspberry Pi and Lightening Halvening are some of the other favorites.
I have been lazy to look those up, but I'm sure they mean Nothing just like bitcoin.

It's almost the reverse of what You Idiots had been saying las' winter.
"Hey buy this clown coupon, it is a ticket to easy street."
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:19:57
Here is what it looks like to me.
You people wanted to be the next Bill Gates, so you had the ingenious idea of buying Bitcoin.
Suddenly Ver undercut your idea with a rival Bitcoin.
You became enraged, and said: "Only our coin is good! We will not tolerate open competition in this here Rothschildian game of monopoly and usury."
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:33:42
Your belief is very similar to your other belief that Bitcoin would moon in '18

No, if you weren't 5 years old and 5 dollars in net worth, you would understand the notion of Estimate.
I estimate, as it were, that Tether doesn't possess 2 trillion dollars in cash.
Something like 0 dollars is more like it

I've been presenting well thought out arguments since 2017 but you Knuckleheads wouldn't listen during the mania phase.
If you watch the Schiff-Keiser debate, you can hear the audience jeering and mocking, and this was around $18,000
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:46:01
So, in your 3rd sentence you say "All mature people know money doesn't grow on trees."
And in your 1st you mention: "Bitcoin is the same thing as a Money Tree. It literally grows millions there."

Why is moderation lax on weekends
Theory: Ever since the halvening of Bitcoin from $20,000 to $3000, moderators had to get a second job as dishwashers.
Just kidding, first job.

It's a popular conspiracy theory that Banks are to blame for something nefarious.
It's very similar to Nibiru, Vaxx, and other conspiracies.

So if I prove to you that gold does solve a problem, will you accept that, or immediately pivot to asking about the dollar
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:46:34
Maybe the richest guy I've known is this Roman Abramovich, and he had incredible shit like billion dollar yachts.
But anyway when he was forced by law to disclose his cash accounts, he only reported around 90 million dollars.
So, if this uber-god had only a handful of millions, then I'm positive the bozo collective called Tether doesn't have $1,800,000,000.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:56:45
The only operating sentence in your post is: "There will be a new ATH in the future."
You are implying that an investment today will go up +1000%.
So if I place 100,000 I will walk away with $1,000,000.
However, that is a claim you cannot make. Because quite possibly there will never be an ATH again.
So, how can one "enjoy" a ride called "The very substance of your life is circling the drain."
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:56:41
Two points:
1. If you didn't ban me for saying Bitcoin is going down, I wouldn't have to re-register
2. If you listened to my advice about Bitcoin, you wouldn't be poorer each day.

It was $300 in 2016
So I think Minus 30 thousand is a good start

It doesn't mention "Clown Coupons" so bitcoin isn't investing

Where can I watch videos of distraught Bitcoin longs, who had expected to own Lamborghini, and today they face a food shortage?
Such videos are always a good Laugh namely

Look, fixed supply is not the cause.
The cause is that No Value can be found in bitcoin.
For example if bitcoin entitled you to withdraw an ounce of gold, and the price of gold was 1200 and bitcoin traded at 1900,
then you could credibly say that bitcoin was overvalued by 700.
But no such benchmark exists, so we can't say it's valued correctly, regardless of supply.

Why would anyone adopt a currency that has no value.
Think about it, if I sell you Locomotives in exchange for Verbal Promises on your part, I'm taking a risk.
Same as taking Internet Clown Coupons in exchange for something real like a pack of turkish delight

It's a very pretentious and above all untrue definition, obviously written by a Desperate Long.
Gold is a metal, bitcoin isn't.
Everything is penetrable, especially in the digital realm.
