its kinda retarded you can get busted for laundering drug money with btc but not at a bank with fiat.
Charlie Schrem is different though, there was more than enough evidence that he wholy knew and promoted his services to silk road.
its a bit different when they come to your bank\exchange on their own

amazon wants the same thing.
I created a crap bank account  and immediately changed pass after signing up
I dont get this new insane trend. EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER SAYS DONT GIVE OUT NAME AND PASS.. and amazon and mii says "hey give us your most important name and pass of all.. we wont do anything bad and please ignore all the corps that lose your credit card data and personal information which is no where near as important as your bank user name and pass"
foudn this post after having problems with miicard.
well the mii system seems to be broke, after getting all my info.
and having my bank text me a code.
and then getting my number
and having my bank call me a code.
the verification failed with no error.
Wrote them.. they said it was an easy fix.. days later.. nothing.
i just want to get rid of some gift credit cards  i got for xmas and turn them into something useful like BTC
yeah fuck everything about miicard and really the amazon payment serivce... you can do the micro deposits and I will send them back.. but as for my user name and pass, FUCK YOU!

because of the reward drop right?
new supply of BTC slows down why demand stays normal = double price.. right?
Uuuuuuunlessss, a whole lot of people felt like you do, and the increase in BTC price from about 6 in july was due to people positioning themselves for the upcoming cut in btc rewards. If that was the case, the increased demand , was brought forward to july and the price already reflects the drop in block rewards.
LOL you can laugh at me in january. Please do.
@_date: 2012-04-19 04:01:38
there is a disconnect between people who want bitcoin for anonymity reasons and people who want bitcoin to become a legitimate currency. Both ideas have demand but they are also in conflict with each other.
Governments like the US will never let bitcoin gain legitimacy, if you can transfer 10k+ without identifying yourself.
All of the exchanges and such have been pressured to start to add more standard protections.

as in martial law.. it really isnt different than what the government can already do. The laws are just being modified as new areas open up.  It would be quite suicidal for a government to shut down the internet for piracy or even a wikileaks event. You know it and they know it.
however just like with martial law, the nation emergency does not have to be a foreign attack, but could also be used against a local rebellion. 
Trying to shut it down for say a leak which the government thought if leaked WOULD cause a rebellion, would probably still cause a rebellion.
@_date: 2012-02-26 04:44:35
just know as bitcoin comes out from underground that the governments eyes will turn more directly on it. They will either try to ban it and that will kill it's open commercial adventure. Or they WILL regulate it and demand the exchanges and everything open up to transparency regulations.(which is one reason why the biggest two(the second isnt really an exchange, biutcoinica) are saying they might start to require photo ids to transfer large amounts of money. Tradehill already closed down due to not wanting to deal with regulations. Look at "liberty dollars"
Also expect more attacks from the likes of mastercard and others who see bitcoin as a threat to the online CC business. They already pressured paxxum to drop BTC.
expansion into the light is cool, just know it will come with thorns and battles we might not be prepared to fight.
@_date: 2012-04-19 14:52:35
Thats fine and all, just note as people want bitcoin to become legit governments are going to want to regulate it and the exchanges, which is why all the exchanges are adding crap like this.
And same with big business they dont want bitcoin to be totally unregulated, because it makes it too much of a gamble to accept them.
One day I see the bitcoin development split(ok maybe a more viable alternative coin than some of the others) because their is a direct conflict between the development of bitcoin as an legitimate alternative currency and the development of bitcoin as an underground currency.
People who demand anonymity, need to give up on the demand that bitcoin become legit and places like newegg to take them. It just wont happen.
Bitcoin already has a huge trust problem when exchanges and wallet services can mysteriously disappear and no one knows shit about the owners.
Hey I dont like it.. I value my anonymity as much as possible and will be looking for alternatives but I am also grounded in reality and know as people push for bitcoin to become legit, we will see more and more regulations take hold.

She is less likely to get arrested and not be there for her family.
She doesnt have to travel to high crime areas to get her drugs.
Due to seller reputation which all can see on silkroad, she is less likely to get something contaminated, fake or just the wrong meds.(yes I am sure you can still get fake, and contaminated shit on silkroad, just saying a dealer on silkroad has more to worry about, with his rep, than dealers on the streets)

nope, not that I know of. Some of the info is sorta shaky at the moment.

So take everything you read with a grain of salt, but it does look like they have put a lot of work into it.
@_date: 2012-03-23 16:59:26
I'm way in the positive.
As for advice, the best advise i can give, is to pay attention to the news and see if the movements are based on something real, or just market manipulation.
I always ask myself, Has anything fundamentally changed with bitcoin, if not, a leave the market alone. and ignore the soars and drops.
like the recent highs were caused by a single individual, manipulating the market. There was no reason to think it would stay above 5 and it didnt. Nothing fundamentally changed.
and tell me are you margin trading on bitcoinica? whats your margin? That site can be dangerous for people not used to the game.
@_date: 2012-01-25 18:27:29
I do think this could help BTC tremendously. I do agree with GrixM that perhaps a guy in a guy fawkes mask isnt the best cover for something that wants to become more main stream but the nice thing about this would be the permanence of advertising in the mainstream.  meaning if this magazine is successful at all, then normal people browsing barnes and noble will be exposed to the magazine. Might pick it up and flip through it.  It would in the long term probably give bitcoin more exposure than the random tv episode and the random and normally negative media exposure. If you mine or hold coin, you really should buy the first issue. Preferably from your local Barnes and Noble, IMO. Yes I know that means going out in the real world and using fiat money... ugh. lol.

You SHOULD be able to buy a digital copy. But I can also see why they are doing this in print. They are trying to break bitcoin out of the digital world. Something people see when browsing a brick and mortar store.

well the big question the community needs to debate on:
Do you want to make bitcoin an alternative market currency?
Do you want to make bitcoin an alternative black market currency?
One comes with convenience and trust but regulations.
The other comes with more anonymity, lack of regulations but also has more trust issues.
Both have demand and their place in the world, and despite the US dollar is both at times, I dont think bitcoin can be.
You can either have your lack of regulations and lack of legitimacy or if you want legitimacy you are going to have to bend on regulations. I dont like it any more than anyone else, but it is a fact of life.

complaining about taxes is one thing, but less than one cent on the dollar? come on it isnt designed for revenue or to steal, it is simply a trade charge for the market to prevent the bullshit trades.
@_date: 2012-06-08 16:29:55
LOL asking a governments to not regulate is like asking a bear to not attack you.
It doesnt give a crap you like bitcoin/or your life.
Bitcoin IMO should focus on staying a black market currency. If it every starts to be come too legit, the governments will turn on it like we just chummed the water.
And really teh bitcoin community which is about anti regulation as you can get need to give up on this utopian pipe dream that in a year or two you will be able to shop at newegg with bitcoins and that bitcoin wont be heavily regulated like dollars. The two cant happen without each other. Well the governments wont let the two happen without each other.
@_date: 2012-09-07 18:04:41
well that is a bit misleading, as it is the instant outlook based on conditions right now With a million dollars you could easily send the price above 13, but you could also buy smart, and not effect the price as much.
the $13 is just stated positions and a lot of it is garbage just designed to try to influence the movement, most of those positions would change if the market started moving.
Still i think you are correct, that the market would NOT skyrocket as the purchaser would do all he could to prevent such a occurance.
@_date: 2012-03-23 16:54:05

It sucks, I am surprised it didnt hurt worse. had a couple pools hacked and coins lost, had paxum pull out due to pressure from the banks(thats pretty big because it suggests the banks will put pressure against bitcoin hindering it's growth. ) and then this. While some folks had problems on tradehill, a lot of people had gone there when gox got hacked and to lose tradehill, i am sure they probably cashed out what they could.

I do think it needs stability for many sites to take it.
you dont want to sell a $700 video card for bitcoin right before they plunge to a penny. But I also wonder if the legal bitcoin market will ever take off as bitcoin lacks many of the protections that credit cards and paypal have. There is a reason why people dont buy shit for cash online.
Maybe&lt; i'm not an expert on this subject by far, but right now it seems like all the killer apps for bitcoins are illegal and for the legal shit, it is just easier to use your CC card or paypal like you normally do. Otherwise their is an intermediary step where you have to purchase bitcoins.

Not a bad article... for a change, not a single mention of ponzi or pyramid..
actually nice to see.
I disagree with them in the end


you can have all kinds of things stolen on the internet including traditional money. I think he is confusing banking protections that often come with CC cards and debit accounts with "a backing commodity"
I get he is trying to say, you cant download a bar of gold but it just comes off wrong IMO.
he also gets the mtgox hack wrong.. and on the guy who had 25k stolen bitcoins he says


well actually they kinda do, it's bits in the banks not bucks, well they got a lot of bucks but they have more bits. And his money wasnt in a bank, it was in his wallet. bicoin is new, the bitcoin banks are just forming, no tradition banks take bitcoins, yet. AND THE FDIC also doesnt guarantee your real life wallet either..go ahead and lose that with a few grand in it and try to make a claim..OR GET YOUR MONEY BACK.
and to cut MTGOX some slack, they never expected the explosion of bitcoin, we are new,  and so far, its really be pretty smooth considering. They have two incidence to point at and one didnt really effect anyone in the community and the other is actually common with dollar bills.

@_date: 2011-08-03 16:36:29
This really has highlighted the fact that in peoples zeal to get on the bitcoin chain some basic practices that we should have due to the wild west ways of the internet disappeared.
There is a shit ton of money in this right now, and it is new. TO thieves yall all look like freshly unwrapped suckers with easily stealible coins. There was plenty of warnings in the forums over mybitcoin and yeah i get not everyone follows the bitcoin forums.
But you have to know while this is an opportunity for you and me, it is also a big one for thieves both amateur and professional.  We have a giant spotlight on us.
Being over paranoid is a good thing in this case, dont leave too much money on any one exchange. Make sure you know more about an exchange or online service than "everyone else uses it"
BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP your wallets.. i'd also prefer you encrypt them.. this is coming soon to the bitcoin client.
The good news in all this, besides for bitcoin buyers and people who felt they missed the good ship lets-get-rich, is it doesnt look like the coins have been traded. People can watch their own coins in block explorer.. the second he starts to spend these or selll them, we will know about it. Not a lot we can do at this point but we will know about it.
So I am hoping for all of you who have coins there, that he is in jail(temp) or the hospital or on vacation with a hot babe and oblivious. It's a very good possibility. There is no real reason to sit on all that coin if he really did steal them.

not sure your point? of course I dont remember that pass. I never will. But I remember my algorithm and I am good at calculating my algorithm.. will someone like my grandma forget her algorithm? not if I show here how to make one she can remember.
I can not go to a site for 5 years, and I will  have the pass for it in 2 minutes.

only 4kBTC to reach $8.
I think it is great for people looking to get in but didnt like the price tag
And unless you can show me where the volume went, you cant blame this on people dumping coins stolen or otherwise. Crap it was like 2hours with zero trading last night on mtgox, tradehill is looking pretty pathetic as well in volume.
IF someone is dumping coins, it isnt on any exchange that I know of.. unless someone can do more than link to twitter messages and other rumors.
The 3rd biggest exchange lost 17,000 BTC.. mybitcoin is MIA with about 100,000 BTC.. what did you expect the market to do? rally?!? really?
this is huge.. it is bigger than the MTGOX hack which really didnt effect anyone that much. It is bigger than the dude who got 25k BTC stolen, as that mainly only effected him.
Mybitcoin effects thousands of people and many bitcoin businesses. And I dont know much about the polish exchange but 17,000 coins have got to effect a lot of people. 
Many perfectly happy traders are despondent as hell. If you had just lost 1000BTC in mybitcoin and have no clue if you would get it back, would you rush to the markets to buy more? Many people used mybitcoin cause they didnt trust their own computer and bitcoin trojans. and suddenly the place they felt safe is just gone..

booting from a clean bootcd, keylogers and screenloggers wont work.
use kypass to store complex passwords and store them in a dropbox if you want to access your passwords remotely.
use full hd encryption.
if you are on a laptop, sign up for a recovery service like lojack.
probably want to set up some remote access for yourself just in case. But as long as you werent logged in when it was stolen they wont be able to get passed the disk encryption.
you cna also run your browser sandboxed, which prevents it from changing your computer.. which also means no cookies(unless you know how to set it up) and no new bookmarks.. it makes a fake version of your computer in a sandbox(just another dir with no rights) and all changes happen there.. you can even safely run most virii in a sandbox just to see what it would do. Just erase the box and you are clean.
in liu of some of my suggestions.. if you suspect you have a virii.. you can use something like the [bitdefender bootcd]( or any one of these bootcds, burn from a friends computer you think is clean... or torrent geeksquads mri and run "face" on it.. just click next.. it will take over night.. it uses many virus scanners.

the network is set up to find 6 blocks an hr, it adjusts the difficulty at 2016 blocks.
we are 60% through this set as 1189 blocks have been found so far.
we are finding blocks at an average of 7.11 blocks an hour.
while you cant predict the next increase with a lot of accuracy due to the nature of mining, a big farm could come or leave tomorrow.
but you can make an educated guess. bitcoin charts has the guess in the top right corner. Being 60% through, you can bet what ever the change will be, [it will probably be pretty close to their prediction at this point.]( baring something unusual happening.

your powercords will get warm to the touch when you start to draw too much power. it is the first indication of electrical overload.
Edit:not sure why the downvote.. yeah it is best to work out how much power you are using and make sure you are under the amperage of your breakers or fuses, however even that isnt always perfect. I have seen fuse boxes with so much oxidation that it was barely passing on power, this caused the fuses to blow a lot, and fucked up a bunch of appliances by melting their plugs.

plenty of quality  and respected security researchers recommend this method.. dont let the ignorant folks get to you.
There can be arguements that their are better methods but it is hard to argue this is a bad method or useless or worse than most peoples habits.
and even though your example is rather tame(which i often do to show this method) I doubt anyone could crack it with one pass. When they are more complex, you have to guess they are based on an algorithm before you can even attempt to crack it.
and you need at least 2 cracked passes.. if not more if your algorithm is complex enough.

Still though, it wont prevent trojans, it is only really helpful against local stealing, or a stolen pc and stupid people will lose more coins this way than what they are trying to prevent AND NEEDS decryption to help repair corrupted wallets.

banking protection.. banking protection... yeah well wait until we have banks.
Plus hackers can attack a small store and often get my CC info and then use my CC.. yes there are protections from my charge but it is a pain and you have to catch it, which not everyone does.
If someone hacks a bitcoin store they get my bitcoin addy which is totally useless for them.. I'd be glad to give it to them if they asked.
with bitcoins I can also see that the charge went through.
Plus bitcoins were never meant to be a replacement for creditcards, they are a currency not a creditcard.. you will probably see something simular to bitcoin credit cards in the near future.
sometimes I really hate stories like this, but still felt the need to share.
They look at a new tech and think this is the way it will always be.
it is like looking at the car when it came out and screaming it will never replace a horse, cause if a horse runs out of fuel, you just pull into the nearest field.. what ya going to do with a car... walk home and order gas from the gas man?(pre gas station era)

HE has a valid business name, no legal challenges to that name, probably has phone service, ads, shop space, customer lists of people with computers, who take them to get repaired(buying a detailed and good list like that is very expensive)

I did not say all algorythms are useful.
yes facebook1234, google1234 would be trival.
but tell me what site this is for hDZv1CO_LsE%pP/4
this is a password made by a slight modification of my algorythm.
you have the pass.. go ahead and tell me what site it is for.. and go head and tell me my algorythm
it should be trivial, since I already gave you the pass.
we are not arguing if 8 chars are weak or not, 8 chars would be weak using his method or not, we are discussing his method. not password sizes.
his method is very weak, but in order to show off algorythms is is better to give a weak example so people can see how the passes are actually developed.
If you want to argue about password sizes and his char set and the simplicity of his algorithm, then i agree.
8 char passes are too small.
His particular algorythm for his example is too simple but still better than most peoples habits.
but that is not what I am talking about, I am talking about a 8 char password created using an algoythm versus a random 8 char password and as long as the algorythm is significantly complex, there is no difference in brute force cracking speed.
and a complex algorithm is no different than lastpasses master pass. it just isnt.... and cant wait for you to tell me what site i use that pass on. My algorithm is based on site name.. I'll give you that much. Should be trivial for you to tell me, which site.

no it cant.. i will sell encyrpted hds all day long on ebay with all my cc info on them, as long as the passphrase isnt stupid you are safe.

someone who knew you had bitcoins or something of value, on your pc that you leave at home and knows you are probably using encryption.. he could install a hardware keylogger and hope he wasnt caught breaking in and that he left no evidence and then later he could steal your wallet and pass. But that requires a more than a lot of preknowledge and luck.

More people will lose money to this than hackers in the first week.
Some of the alternative coins have already added this feature by copying the beta, they have all had a slew of people losing their coins as they encrypt them and moments later forget the pass.
Even after all this time in the digital age, people still have crappy password management practices.
it also needs a decrypt function for repairing corrupted wallets.
@_date: 2011-06-24 18:12:07
yeah that also seem to think that hackers have hidden knowledge... they do know that most  random generators are basically algorithms themselves.
it is also no different than an encryption key.
But they seem to think the 'hacker" will see my pass and realize "omg this guy is using algorthms and not a random generator.. I bet it is based on the site name"
and then he will form a new dictionary, cause god knows that is fun and easy. ANd this dictionary will take care of just about every algorythm i could make using the site name.
and you know what? when he was done, he would find he pretty much has recreated teh standard brute force dictionary.
yeah If i was the richest bitcoiner.. or one of the top 100, I might be concerned about this method and no where did I deny that their isnt better methods, but this method is not only good enough for 99.9999% of the people, it is better than what 99.99% of the people use right now.

I thought it was a bit obvious that it was slightly less anonymous than dollar bills.
I can send you dollars and not be able to prove you got them, but send coins to an addy and there is a record.
You could probably scrape a lot of donor addys from peoples sig lines and develop quite the database of users and addys. Of course their client lets them use more than one but still you could develop a good idea of as lot of people.
You could also look at the market places, look for user A selling to user B some item for some odd number 12.3 bitcoins and then simply look for a transaction around the same time for the same amount in block explorer. and make your list even bigger.
if people want to use bitcoins as a semi anonymous replacement for dollars, they really have to develop good practices in using and posting their addresses.

yeah some are very justice and envy minded. There is a great documentary about it, where you can really get a feeling for the emotions of apes.
They have even shown it to a degree in dogs. If you praise and reward a dog for doing a trick, say rolling over, and then you ask another to do it, and he does and you dont reward him.. you dont praise him, instead you look disappointed. If you do this a couple times the dog will first try other tricks, anything to get you to praise him. If that doesnt work they get very despondent.  And while this might seem more like simple confusion, they do this in response to the other dog getting praise. As dogs will often do tricks without reward, if taught, but they notice something isnt right when one dog gets praises for doing the same trick they do and they dont get the same praise.

"it's still going down but the guy said it was trending up"
"omg it is falling but the guy said it was trending up"

Screw trending, it is like added info to puzzles that are meant to confuse, it is better to look at what is actually going on in the community.

100000000000% bulllshit. A googleplex percent bullshit.
what they could do... if throw the ram in liquid nitrogen if you had logged on within 30 seconds of them stealing it.
[Cold boot attack on disk encryption](
IF encryption worked the way you seem to think it does, it would be meaningless and bitcoin pretty much would not work.
I inspect my system all the time but I am in security.
you can thwart keyloggers with an onscreen keyboard. [kaspersky anti virus comes with its own on screen keyboard FOR THIS EXACT PURPOSE.](
yep they can do a screen logger.. but most do a series of screen shots, they would need to set it up to record video.. which is a bit more noticable as it takes up a lot of space and is much harder to go through to find the spot where he is using an on screen keyboard for his pass.
and you are expecting them to have a key logger going and then steal my laptop later?
If you doubt me will be more than glad to mail you an encrypted hd and you go ahead and show everyone how physical access will let you crack it.  I'm not saying a targeted person under attack wont be gotten to.. But if you are encrypted you can lose your laptop all day long.. doesnt matter one bit.
edit: if really concerned of a targeted attack with keyloggers and screen capture.. simply keep the bitcoin in an encrypted container and use a live cd to boot to the computer .. each time you want to open that container. As long as the live cd is clean, there isnt a way they can remotely keylog or screen capture you.

Not sure the downvotes, maybe cause our answers will be mostly meaningless, if you could predict the future with much accuracy at all, you could make a mint.
but since you want theories.. yeah I think it will hang in there. A lot of geeky people like it for the sheer geekiness of it, some libertarians like it for the idea of it all. It feels a little like controlling our own destiny. 
The development of bitcoin related tools is going at a great pace,  ati cards are still disappearing in minutes of being restocked at newegg.
More and more ways to spend them are opening up.
and of course bitcoin also has a nice home in the black markets and hacking scene. You can rent seedboxes for torrents with bitcoin. and lets not forget gambling. The us has made it harder to do online gambling, bitcoin has made it easier.
the recent mtgox hack didnt seem to really slow down bitcoin much at all, or mtgox much for that matter, despite they were down for so long. The new wallet trojan hasnt hurt the scene much either.
and obviously people were mining coins and buyng coins before it seemed to be even worth it
So I theorize for right now that bitcoin will stay a float.... but in counter to my own theory, there are many things that could hurt it. Cracking the system, someone figuring a way to counterfeit the coins, a sustained government crack down on coins and exchanges, a viable and better alternative might be made, someone with a lot of coin could flood the market. who really knows, but pretty much everyone in here, thinks it will stick around for a while longer.

sales taxes in the us will probably have to replaced as we move online. our states cant force businesses that dont have a presence in their state to collect sales taxes and it is starting to be a problem.
whats bad is it creates an adversarial nature between governments and business when in reality it is  between the governments and their citizens. The only reason why businesses have to collect sales taxes, is because their customers wouldnt pay them voluntarily. When it is actually a tax on the customers.
when you arent charged sales tax on an item be it from the internet or a traditional catalog, legally you are supposed to pay that tax with your income taxes,  just no one does.

there is actually arguments on the opposite. a truely random password is hard to remember. Yeah last pass remembers it but what if they are gone or hacked(which they have been keepass is better than lastpass)
this is why so many websites do the security questions, the fact that people forget their passes make them insecure as they have to have password reset systems with security questions.
(and i go one step further than him and encrypt the ansers to my security questions, so it doesnt matter if you know my dogs name or my mothers birthplace)
And I am not saying this is the bestest method but compared to most peoples security, it is lightyears better than what they use.
it allows you suitably complex passwords, that are easy to remember and it encourages you to use different passes on each site. This is far far better than the standard "password" or "letmein" or "123456"
and far better than most peoples practices.

they are losing value, we are in a deflationary phase, but they have gained value so much that it isnt noticeable. I know that sounds like a contradiction but the same thing happens to the dollar.
and what are your credentials?
Bitcoin will never replace the worlds currencies and if it continues to exist, it will always be an alternative currency that you trade fiat for. There is a reason why the entire planet went off the gold standard and it wasnt a conspiracy that did it, not idiocy. The countries that did, got out of the depression faster than those who waited, those who waited saw what happened to those who didnt and did it as well.
sure fiat is also vulnerable to market swings and depression, but no where near the level of a hard currency.

some might argue this isnt the ground floor.. 2-3 years from now, I think they will regret saying that.

it does make you wonder now, how many of the hacks we have suffered were actually professional caused

SHOW ME WHERE HE SOLD THEM!!! volume is pathetic.. dumping didnt cause this. Bad news did.

People are just making shit up.

Yeah immediately I became against raising capital gains taxes, and started screaming obama is a socialist and then the price dropped back down to 13.5.

paypal and ebay and many banks use the dongle.
easier is automated text messages that do the same thing, cause most people already have a phone.
but yeah there are 3 main ways of identifying you and that covers 2 of them.
1. what you know.... password.
2. what you have.. a dongle or cell phone.. or key
3. what you are.. biometrics.

[Banks have had people arrested many times in the past]( for keeping what was accidentally put in their accounts. You dont own what you got by accident. You just dont.
It isnt his. He is just a scumbag and deserves to be arrested and prosecuted.  He didnt earn it, he didnt find it, it was an accident.
IF HE DESERVES TO KEEP THE MONEY, THEN YOU DESERVE THE BILL WHEN SOMEONE ELSE HITS YOUR CAR, THEY ARE BOTH ACCIDENTS!

true most people still shop locally.
But online sales growth has been going through the roof, each yeah blowing away the year before.
[Online Shopping Sees Explosive Growth in 2010](
Personally I get a lot of my staples sent to me automagically from amazon.com
In [big cities, online grocers are starting to kick ass](
there is also a growing problem with [smart phones and people using brick and mortar]( stores to check out products and then they use the bar scanner app to find the best price online and buy it from there instead.
It really is exploding even if you dont notice it. More and more people are getting more and more use to online shopping. And I can tell you, xmas, i nearly never see the inside of a store.
one other [supporting link](


phones to check prices (22%), research products
(21%) and purchase online (13%) as compared to last


participate in online shopping as compared to 17%
last year
it's growing like crazy

safer keeping your own wallet and backing it up.
 your real wallet exists in the "cloud" as semarj says, all you got is the keys, make as many copies as you want but like your house or car, if you make  copy of the key, you dont get a second house or car. It would be nice but i suspect key copying would be very expensive then.

lol after what they did to their website.. and the fact that they havent changed it back or to something else.. should tell everyone that these peoples advice is something not to take.
@_date: 2011-06-24 14:58:38
well if you pick a time frame "per hour" sure.
but difficulty is set up, as per 2 weeks.
the per hour variability is meaningless over this time frame as it averages it out to about 6 per hour... doesnt matter if you get 10 sometimes.
I believe that is right but my coffee is low.. 2016 coins every two weeks 336 hours in 2 weeks.. 6 coins an hour
ahh quick look up.. yeah the networks trys to keep it average 6 per hour, but averaged over 2 weeks.

on reddit you can find a subreddit for anything
[Lots of redditor vetted surveys here.

people would probably suggest it was a way for moooooslim terrorists to funnel money to the dems or some shit like that.
and would probably get a breitbart video of Satoshi Nakamoto having sex with a cgi'd panda.
and they would go hard core trying to close it down and the exchanges citing not the political donations but things like silk road.
Still think it is a good idea for bitcoin to expand into as many places as possible.

yeah i was joking .. cause if people quit mining maybe the difficulty will go down so my pathetic system can mine more coins.
yeah all the good atis are going for bank still
these days people use a /s for poes law.. back in my day we used a winking smilie. No worries, i'm not an idiot, just being over dramatic and sarcastic.

he says it is too complicated.. I can understand that when trying to explain it to the non techie type people.
