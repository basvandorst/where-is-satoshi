looks like we could be in for a period of "huge" growth that after 5\-8 years will collapse upon itself in ways that will make us wish for the "great recession" economy....

People are not waiting for sub 10k lol. They are waiting for sub 5k and lower

If you go off of history and how BTC does have major price corrections then a drop down to the $3k-$5k range again would be completely normal and expected. After that its off to the races.

Bull trap. Over 100 million USD worth of BTC has moved out of whale wallets and into the exchanges. They are getting ready to sell and take profits.

100 million dollars worth. I’ll will add the edit now.

Sigh.... It's part of the market mentality padawan.

The FOMO will come to a crash by end of May when the dump happens LOLOLOL. The amount of people who will be burned by this will be quite amusing.

Sooooo true. All the YouTube "experts" lol are trying their hardest to pump this and say how they called it and to buy their classes/pay to be a part of there trading groups. Its so fucking sad/funny at the same time all the simps out there.

HAHAHHAHAHAHA. That's rich. I remember when everyone was saying if BTC goes below 10k I'm all in. Then it was if BTC goes below 6.5k then it was 5k, 4k, etc.... This is a pump and dump and prepare to see a pull back. It would not surprise me to see BTC re-test the sub 3k level this month. I will enjoy shorting and taking noob money hehhehehehe.

If you do a simple google search you then be pointed towards the wallets addresses and see that the BTC is being sent to exchange addresses.

Hahahaha true. Many of us will bag up when we go back down in the next month and then take profits in 2021-2022. Then load up again and repeat.

I agree

Use proper TA and trend analysis. The two combined is the closest thing to a crystal ball. Also experience.

I agree. People are about to get burned. My analysis is showing a by end of May dump and BTC going to the 2.5k-3.5k range. The market makers have moved OVER 100 MILLION BTC to the exchanges over the past few days. They are getting ready to sell to the retail FOMO. Don't get burned.....

Be greedy when others are full of fear and be fearful when they are full of greed.

pump and dump.

It is not FUD. It’s called being a realist. Stop being a moon boy bc you bought in at the height and got your ass handed to you by the market lol. BTC will eventually go back up. When? Know one has a clue and it’s all crystal ball talk. When large amounts of BTC eat moved that’s fucking fact. Welcome to blockchain ��

Check the wallets history and cross check it with what Binance has stated in the past.....
