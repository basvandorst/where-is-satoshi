why would they loose the block when 40% of miners dont accept it? the non BU network part will just accept the blocks. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:13:02
you will have coins on both chains.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:54:44
Segwit isn't the holy grail either. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:39:08
this statement is absurt. 40% hash power to BU and you are trying to put it off as nothing. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:44:47
All his money is in alt coin pumps :D
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:57:46
To be fair, blocks have been full quite a bit in the past months. Over time people and organisations discard bitcoin because for certain transactions the fee is too high. This creates a natural balance. Don't get me wrong, I think increasing the block-size is a terrible approach for scaling.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:31:16
directly after the split the sum worth of coins on both chains will likely be less than what it is now. note that i am saying likely, because no one knows. splits are... bad. there are multiple risks, which are not entirely clear yet in the blockchain community because the technology is so new. over the course of time, one chain will likely die while the other will continue. And you will have coins on both chains. :)
in my eyes bitcoin hasn't been in worse waters ever before, surprised the price is still at $1k. and i'm saying this while holding bitcoins myself.

with attack you mean BU forking.

I always set a manual fee of $0.01, takes a couple hours, sometimes a day but it always gets confirmed.
@_date: 2017-03-30 07:56:55
Not for long now anymore...
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:00:48
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:19:31
Why this?
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=1024 ; mkswap /swapfile ; swapon /swapfile
echo "/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:08:41
Do you have definitive proof of this? Any  case, that would be very expensive spam.
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:46:42
Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:31:50
if you are not in a hurry set a smaller fee, it will likely still be picked up by a miner at some point.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:19:12
You have to dive into bitcoin mechanics for this.
In bitcoin, Unspent Transaction Outputs have to be spend in their entirety. So if you only want to send someone a part of the coins of this unspent output, you will send a part back to an address you control, which makes 2 output addresses (this is handled automatically in electrum). This is the most common type of transaction and is about ~250 bytes in size. 
Here is an example of a one input and two output transaction:

how do u broadcast the altcoin tx if i have the private key?
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:31:53
Ok sorry I am new with PGP. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:45:15
yes that sucks, bitcoin and small amounts are not that great anymore. in electrum settings you can enable setting a fee manually, give this a try. i wonder though why the lowest automatic fee would be $13, are there alot of inputs? if you dont know what this is please send the address from which you are trying to send.
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:15:05
If bitcoin.org would be compromised and an edited binary is served the attacker can also serve his own signature file and key because they are hosted on the same site.
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:03:55
if he only came up with an implementation that isnt cheatable huh
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:00:41
there are already many other altcoins that do this better than bcash. e.g. ethereum and litecoin. which also have proper dev teams and other uses.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:58:06
take a look here  it looks like 30 satoshi/byte will be highly likely to be picked up in a day. a one input two output transaction is about 250 bytes. so the fee would then be (30*250) / 100000000 * 4600 = $0.35. anycase, if the transaction will not be included in a block the coins just stay in the current address. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:20:52
type normal and make sense
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:34:33
ur right and hes lieing. orders are fulfilled by third parties mostly using amazon vouchers which are worth less than a global currency because they are only spendable at amazon.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:04:54
if anything is a fraud its fiat printing money. negative intrest rates, wtf how does that happen in a fair system?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:56:41
well the question will be answered in the coming two months, intresting times :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:32:10
thanks for your contribution!
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:44:05
Every company uses them, even huge ones like Steam. I guess you don't use bitcoin for business2consumer commerce.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:53:26
pretty scary and retarded they dont accept bitcoin. i hope to see a pow change on 2x day which isnt completely unrealistic. would hold off buying sha2 asics.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:56:08
for a hardfork yes ofcourse everyone has to update. yes miners will take a loss, but thats the risk of investing in this game, the risk of business. it will be a lesson that investing into asics is very dangerous but also very lucrative, for the long term asics are bad for crypto anyway since as to what we can see right now they lead to centralization. The chain would be as secure as its price is, since hashrate follows the money (mostly, e.g. some miners dont mine bitcoin cash when its more profitable). 
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:23:26
there is a proposal and tested code from lukejr using sha3 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:45:33
go for it but every coin i sold until now was at a loss lol. soon we have 2x and 1x chain, which u gna buy? if u hold u will have both. shit is hard i cant make my mind up either.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:48:34
it is not in its current stages. two main reasons: lose your private key or get hacked? your money is gone. the common man has very little skills to prevent both of them. and then the tx limit makes it so bitcoins capability is not enough to facciliate even 0.01% of txs made worldwide. but like any valuation its not only its current state that matters but also future potential.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:56:54
its just as easy to write malware as its for linux. i would say most skilled devs are more competent in a linux environment even. linux user base is however much more tech savvy and wont get malwared as easy as your average windows user.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:20:34
Fuck I must have been sleeping you are right. I am sorry.
This would of been the tx:
Again, sorry for spreading mis information. Still you are paying a much higher fee than nessecary, as the mempool was close to empty at that time and it isnt a high priority tx, is it?
edit: I thought u would be an employee if bitpay but it wasn't a food order after all :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:52:41
if hacked they will keylog or what ever nessecary to get access to the online wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:06:28
+1 amount like this is way too late to get rich with
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:10:28
I mean it is just one core member who wrote this and I dont know which other people support it, however, if the chain wouldnt get any hash rate anymore they dont really have an alternative right?
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:56:52
lol u think 2fa makes you save when your pc is malwared? you are probably more skilled than the comman man and still not enough knowledge about security. says enough.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:06:07
i hope for a pow change by core (already prepared afaik) if the 2x chain will get all the hash power on 2x hard fork day, which seems to be the case right now.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:21:10
yes yes yes on everything except bitspeed cus havent heard about it
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:38:04
why you mad
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:10:04
because bitcoin sucks
@_date: 2017-06-25 02:13:33
wtf. copy the walletfile to whereever you want to save it. 1mb usb stick is enough.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:42:39
segwit is well tested 
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:09:35
so if bitcoin crashes to $50, can you carry the burden?
bitcoin node as an investment? what? please.
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:55:32
netherlands also has bitcoin for thuisbezorgd.nl and i used to order there using bitcoin but been indeed paying by bank lately.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:00:43
cloud isnt a nono as long you encrypt the wallet with a strong passphrase. put it on an usb, pc and cloud.
create the wallet from a linux live cd without internet connection.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:06:00
Just going to answer some things briefly but to understand everything you cant go without a technical understanding.
1) segwit enables current implementations of payment channels such as the lightning network. These payment channels can be used to do transaction outside of the blockchain. Now, the miners get fees on transactions that are ON the blockchain. So why would they want us to be able to do transactions OFF the blockchain?
Secondly segwit will kill asicboost that some miners may or may not be using.
bip148 is a proposal to split the chain and enable segwit  on it without large miner support. After segwit is enabled a current implementation of the payment channel concept called lightning can be activated
No one knows

lmao maybe 20years ago.
