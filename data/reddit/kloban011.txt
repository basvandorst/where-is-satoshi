I raise valid questions. I am so glad you could provide such a deep and insightful comment, as all of your recent comments are truly a wonder to behold. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

I think Crypto as a currency that is to be mined is fundamentally flawed to be honest. As a store of value, I still think it is pretty good though! Even though a lot of people on here hate the government and that it should not interfere with the markets at all, I think that is an insane viewpoint and I'm very free market leaning. 
The over site and stability that the government provides by keeping inflation/deflation at the approximate levels they want is actually pretty miraculous, something that cannot be done with a mineable coin, unless the inflation/deflation is predetermined. Sure there is going to be some bullshit (like keeping Gold's worth lower than normal, bailing out companies that should fail) but overall this actually keeps our economy strong, even if there is underlying bullshit. 2009 would have been way more hellish if the government would have just said, "you guys figure it out". :D

You're absolutely right. Most people here claim to be so against "greedy bankers" but they all act exactly like "greedy bankers" because truth be told, being greedy is a "smart" thing to do; humans are all greedy as fuck. We should all just admit that to ourselves. If you look around this subreddit, every other person obsesses over the price which leads me to believe there is a lot of cognitive dissonance going on around here.
IMO, Bitcoin as a currency sucks. Deflation is TERRIBLE for any economy. Why do I want to buy something today, when my "currency" will buy me 10X as much a year from now? I wouldn't unless I had hundreds of Bitcoin to spare, which very few people have - just look at the estimated Bitcoin distribution. Bitcoin, as a store of value however, is something that is game changing in my opinion. Bitcoin/economies are a signalling and messaging tool which block chain accomplishes quite well. 
The one saving grace, and in my opinion this one is huge, is that Bitcoin has the first market mover advantage. I truly believe the first to market and name will carry BTC out for many, many years to come, although at some point a "flippening" of another crypto may emerge and become king.
From my limited understanding the core development team may have some tricks up their sleeves to allow for faster/cheaper transactions, but that has yet to be seen. I still love Bitcoin though. :)

Buy 10,000, 50,000 or 100,000 coins in a very short period to kick start a rally. 
Take a 10 to 1 leveraged position to short it via Futures contracts, or whatever the maximum leveraged position is.
Even if they sold all of their coins at a complete loss, they are still 900% ahead ahead on the way down. Obviously it's a huge gamble, but if banks really are threatened, collusion by multiple banks is not out of the question.
I am not saying this will happen, but anything is possible.

For sure, my excel sheet is interactive, I was just being conservative. I think Cyrpto will be between 1-5% of the total markets in the next 10 years as well. Bitcoin has been 60% for a long time now, and I believe first market mover advantage is huge. 
Stock to flow was actually disproven by a friend of Plan-B, BUT it is the closest model we have IMO. The guy has some paper that was ridiculously hard to read but I do believe it since he's a quant. Will see if I can find the article.

This was based off Tom Lee's calculations, so out of his ass\*. Come one man! ;) He has been doing analysis in the banking industry since the 90s and now has his own firm. 
On top of that, the entire excel file is interactive, so don't take it as gospel; this is just one of many scenarios we might see.
I do believe this is conservative though.

Every $1B in Crypto translates into a $25B price appreciation, according to Tom Lee. Same thing with S&amp;P500. If liquidated tomorrow, you might only see 20 cents on the dollar, so 5 to 1, as an example.

If I have time this week, I will clean it up. Can even post the file somewhere or put it in a Google Drive doc.

Accounted for I think. Miners are greedy by nature, and they vote using Hash power. Bitcoins protocol can be upgraded rather quickly from SHA-256 to some other Quantum Algo. Since miners want to obtain bitcoin, but also want the price to remain high, they would "vote" with their hash power on this new algorithm, with their upgraded quantum computers.  
As far as I know though, if SHA-256 can be broken, the entire internet and banking structure would be kaput and would also need an update.

For some reason my text was deleted with the original post...anyway, assumptions here are $68T passed from Boomers to millennials over 25 years. A 25 to 1 price appreciation for each dollar invested into crypto with Bitcoin dominating 60% of the market share.
$1T will be invested by millenials each year and just 1% going to crypto, which I find plausible. I think we are still pretty early in the market...but if anyone can poke holes in this, I do like halving ;) alternative perspectives.
EDIT: Can clean this up a bit if there is more interest...I just made it for myself. :)

Nice. S&amp;P500 still averages 10% since it started, so that is not a bad strategy either, it is just the long game. If you max out your IRA and 401k since 21 to 65 you are also pretty much guaranteed to be a millionaire, especially with the tax write offs.   
But I agree...even a 1-5% portfolio in crypto could return 100x yields in the next 10-12 years and losing 1-5% of your portfolio, the risk to reward is too great to ignore Bitcoin IMO!

$160k Generational wealth + $66k from US working investments multiplied by 2 for the world (\~$132k...plus the $160k = $293k) + current price of $8.3k when I did this = \~$301k
There is an argument that the $160k in generational wealth should also use a 2X worldwide multiplier (In my case, I did not double it it) because US demographics don't exactly mirrior other countries, but I think I am being conservative still.
The entire excel sheet is interactive and I could have made it look a bit prettier but this was for my own use and thought I'd share!

Here it is...It was a tough read...  
@_date: 2019-11-04 01:08:15
You have to remember, my analysis mostly takes into account the US only. Doesn't account for generational wealth from other countries. The $301k even at 1% is closer to 1/2 a mil if the world has that much generational wealth (outside of the US).

If I could upvote you 100 times I would. Thank you!
