I have processed your withdraw, however I would like to provide you with some options on how you can prevent future delays.
1) Add 2FA security - This tells us the withdraw that was initiated was done by the actual owner of account, and will prevent an unauthorized withdrawal in case your computer becomes compromised. (settings page)
2) Create Pre - Approved withdraw addresses for coins you know you will be withdrawing frequently. (settings page)
3) Always withdraw to same withdraw address - This tells us the coins are going to a previously used address and are less likely
going to a hacker who will generate a new address not already used.
4) Do not login to Cryptsy using TOR or any other means that conceals the true origin of user.
The safety of your investment is extremely important to us, and we will continue to do all we can to ensure that any withdraws made on your
account are authorized by you.

Official Response to the CoinFire Release:
[5/1/2015 9:30:42 PM] Paul Vernon: In response to coinfire
I’d like to make a statement regarding coinfire’s article claiming we are lying about being fully licensed.
First off, we’ve never made any claims about being fully licensed at the state level.  I’m unsure where they received their information from, but like every other Bitcoin company in the US, we do not have state level MSB licenses.  Are we working to acquire them?  Yes, but the process can take years.
There is no company that is fully licensed at the state level in the US.  None.
We do, however, fully comply with our Federal MSB requirements.  This includes filing SAR (Suspicous Activity Reports) and CTR (Currency Transaction Reports).  We also have one of the most extensive KYC programs in the industry, scrub accounts against the OFAC list, and perform Transaction Monitoring.   At a federal level, we are compliant.  
Federal compliance is the only claim we have ever made and will make.
I invite the writer at coinfire to contact me so I can show him what we do have, and what we don’t.  I’m sure we could chat for hours about the woes of a Bitcoin related company attempting to get licenses from all the states.
It seemed to be a good investigation, but it was based on a false premise.

We are in compliance with all US Federal laws and we have never claimed to be licensed by all 50 states as the header
of that article has twisted users and readers into thinking.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:59:10
Please see the response to the ticket you submitted.  It fully explains the reason for your complaint and how to resolve it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:03:10
What is your username so i can lookup your account
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:57:28
Due to this case some have made very valid points. We will be taking a closer look at how we are handling accounts that are inactive for long periods of time. Our main priority is to keep our users investments as secure as possible even if they are not currently active.  We will keep the userbase informed of any changes.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:10:14
Please submit a ticket addressed to me with your username so i can lookup the information you are showing and i will be happy to assist you

cryptonumismatist: I am sorry you feel this way.
We have had this security procedure in place for nearly a year, and all but you ( thousands) have been thankful we cared enough to move their coins to a more secure location.
We do care about our users investments and our  goal is to provide a safe environment for users to trade and store their coins.  Returning your coins to your live balance requires only that you contact support. It generally takes less than 1 hour in most cases for the coins to be returned.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:57:05
When a user is unable to answer security questions, they are referred to our verifications team to verify ownership. This is to prevent
coins from leaving Cryptsy and going to a hack or unauthorized person who is not the actual owner of account.  I cannot put personal information about this account in public but you know why the funds are currently being held and what you need to do to gain access to them as it has been fully explained to you. If you are indeed the actual owner of the account.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:31:27
We have to comply with regulations posed to us by state and federal authorities.  They make the decisions on what documents we must obtain.  
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:14:57
We did not ignore you, you were immediately referred to our verifications team where you submitted outdated documents of two different people.  
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:00:41
If your account was inactive, its very possible your coins are in cold storage waiting for you to become active again.  If this is the case, simply contact customer support and your coins will be restored to balance.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:08:55
Go ahead and submit a new ticket, ask for Jshock and we can try to resolve this for you.  
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:34:56
Due to the current status of your region, we have decided to wave normal procedures for this and accept the documents you have submitted.  I have sent you an email indicating that both accounts involved have been unfrozen and you may now withdrawal your funds.  Please be sure to withdrawal them to an address previously used before.
