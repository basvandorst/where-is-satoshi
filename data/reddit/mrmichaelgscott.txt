That not surprising considering there's fuck all volume. 
But the problem with bitcoin is people can't agree on what it is. Is it a currency? Then you want stability (extremely low volatility). Is it a store of value? Then you want low volatility with slow steady growth. Is it an investment? Then volatility is good with long term upwards trend. Can't have it all. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:34:51
So it's not a store of value, but rather a currency?
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:52:45
Are you serious? I just told you like a second ago.

How dare you use sound reason and logic here!

Please explain how the deflationary nature is Bitcoin is supposed to work as an everyday currency? Who would want to spend their bitcoin if it's going to be worth more the next day?
Store of value I can understand, but that will obviously only be a serious contender with long term and widespread adoption (same with uoa).
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:32:55
But I thought it was supposed to be a currency?
@_date: 2018-10-26 03:59:15
So why even mention wealth disparity in your previous comment?
I like Bitcoin, but it's obvious that many people on here including yourself cannot take a step back and examine it from an objective viewpoint. There are many issues that bitcoin fans are too quick to brush aside in the name of defeating the big mean banking system.

I'm not reading that fucking wall of text, give me a TL;DR.
I think that if Bitcoin wants to succeed there needs to be a consensus on its main purpose. As per my original comment, right now people are treating bitcoin as a currency, store of value, and an investment all at the same time. That doesn't work. Hence why we have separation between currencies, defensive, and growth investments etc.
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:47:51
Did not say it didn't exist, I asked for a TL;DR.
But using your bullshit logic please read the entirety of this article 
@_date: 2018-10-26 07:50:39
We were taught multiple economic schools of thought, orthodox, heterodox, modern monetary theory etc.
I don't agree with you on deflation. While it may not destroy an economy it is a worse alternative than a small amount of inflation, as it increases debt levels, discourages spending and investment, and can lead to inflation.
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:51:10
The "bankers control the world bullshit" is too conspiratorial for me. It's quite simple economics not lies, please educate yourself.
The argument is not "inflation is good", but rather "low inflation is better than deflation" hence why most central banks aim for 2-3% as a safe zone.
Currency that carries low inflation is fine, we have investments that offset inflationary effects which is where most people store their wealth. Wealth generally is not stored directly in the form of cash for the long-term.
@_date: 2018-10-26 02:55:03
How can you say that with a straight face when Bitcoin wealth distribution is extremely centralized?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:22:18
Whatever happens please update us!
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:18:09
Lmao I never "inflation is good", seriously can you not read?
Refer to my comment earlier,


So what are you pointing out if I never said that? 
Deflation is shithouse. Look at any economies where deflation has occurred, it was a disaster.
I have read The Bitcoin Standard, it was somewhat interesting but saifedean obviously has a biased adgenda. I also majored in economics.

People buying at 15k were speculators hoping that the price would continue to increase and they could make profits. Now that the anus has fallen out of the market why would these same speculators continue to buy when the chances of them making profits are very slim? The bulk of the people were in it for money, not the tech.
The psychology of this guy. It's beautiful.

Why would they stockpile bitcoin when it cannot do anything useful?
They're stockpiling cash because they believe assets (equities, property, etc) may crash. 
Cash will maintain a fairly steady value, with some slight decrease due to inflation, which will reduce the impact on their capital during a recession.
Bitcoin is extremely volatile, it would be literally the worst asset to stockpile.

I agree it'll be digital, absolutely it will be. However, it will not be Bitcoin. Read up on currencies and how they actually function to serve their purpose. Now compare that to the structure of Bitcoin. Inflationary "currencies" will simply not function as a viable currency. Bitcoin encourages hoarding, which in turn stops people spending, and grinds an economy to a halt. Economics 101 dude, it's pretty simple stuff.
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:16:35
Says the ignorant fella that thinks somehow bitcoin will magically save the world if the entire financial system collapses.
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:12:59
Yes, an asset, not a currency.
