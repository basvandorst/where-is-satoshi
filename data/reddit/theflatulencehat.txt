The blacks will be so pissed. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:23:37
Yeah. Either way, it was a small amount, and I'm willing to pay whatever it is on the 15th.

Touche, good sir. I just waited FOREVER for memegenerator to load, so I figured screw it, I'll just mirror that sonuva.

The community thanks you having no faith in the currency itself, and only looking for monetary gain. Thanks, dickbag. 
EDIT: Why the downvotes?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:31:03
I wouldn't complain at that rate. lol
@_date: 2013-02-24 01:39:48
Where, pray tell does this take place? I'm intrigued.

Which over the next two days should offer legitimate buyers the chance to snag some last minute half-off BTC.

I don't have the technical know-how, and I'll also confess I didn't read far enough to see if this was mentioned, but what about implementing Authy type two-factor Authentication on websites, and possibly even offline wallets? I know that's what Coinbase uses, FWIW.

Yeah I didn't think about that. Price range is probably Lenovo on my end too. ;-) I've had good luck with Asus' cheap laptops also.

Groupon for Bitcoin. 
Groupcoin? Biton? BitGroupon?

It show's an amount x.xBTC was purchased with $xx.xx from xxxxx. So it LOOKS like I got what I wanted, at the given price. But this is my first time buying.

This is from the owner of that Twitter account:

Whatever, Sean.

I think at that point you'd be looking at a spammade DDOS. lol

Agreed. I have .45 GS right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:12:08
It just seems weird that the variable you control is the BTC amount when purchasing. I understand they have to do what they have to do but it seems like it would be simpler to say I'd like to be charged $100USD, (however much BTC that is) as opposed to I'd like 15BTC, here's the price, and btw it MIGHT be the price it might not be.

Hoping this rings true. Sitting around pressing "buy" on CoinBase for shits and giggles. 
EDIT: Coinbase let me buy! Yay!

Starting a site to share files for free instead of using something else that's free.. so what's the difference? You (or anyone) didn't have to USE the service. It goes back to the old saying "build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door." 
If you read the Wired article, as well as others, you'll get some clarification on the "panic" room. 
Lastly, the industry (Bitcoin) is waiting for someone to do something like this, and sure, it will be at a profit, because that's how business works. Credit card companies charge interest, loans have fees, etc. It's the name of the game. Whoever does it best/first/cheapest, will have the leg up on the competition and make the biggest buck.

Now THAT's an idea.. set up a quick website and a donation wallet then once we have enough we can give them to everyone who donated above a certain denomination, then sell the rest. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:02:41
For the record, I upvoted this and didn't get paid a cent. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:38:03
That's a good point. I guess I flew off a little bit on someone who was (perhaps greedily) opportunistic, and that's not really his fault. Been watching the news all morning so that probably didn't help. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:46:22
Is Coinbase a solid place to buy?
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:20:51
Came here to ask this.. It's an interesting story, sure, but it didn't say one word about Bitcoin... did it?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:01
I don't recall to be honestly. I had seen this message earlier today, but to be honest I don't recall it being there when the purchase finally went through. I guess the question is how can they assure me a BTC amount *while* assuring me the USD coming from my account? It's pending, sure, but on Monday will I get hosed if it's a lot higher than what I agreed to buy at? I would think this message would be tied to the pending transfer amount, right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:36:09
Dam. How much fiat you have sitting around for the opportune drop? lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:51:27
So *in theory* the attempt can be made as often as possible/practical, since it's up at any given time and the only way to check is by making the attempt. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:05:39
FLASHABLE ZIP PLEASE THANK YOU. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:52:45
Yeah. Mine wasn't to far below that. Since it was my first purchase, I made it a small one so if I lose every cent, I'm not that concerned. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:02:48
I think the fact that he gives a shit about the privacy of his users alone debunks your claim that he is "a businessman like the rest of them." This is why people will continue to use his products. 
As for his money coming from "shady practices," he developed a product that was super widely used; I wouldn't call that a shady practice. Just my two cents. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:45:00
I don't know how quick you can get verified, but I snuck in a purchase on Coinbase today. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:06:28
Idk about the rest of the community here, but I know that a "beautiful, stubborn wife" has been the best thing for me when it comes to Bitcoin. Have an upvote. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:48:45
It's not the analogy I have trouble with, it's that you think he did this. He created a service, complied with all takedown notices received per the law, and was shut down. So I don't really get where he was doing this knowingly, or even unknowingly for that matter. I think we're forgetting he was complying with all takedown notices per the DMCA. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:23:59
Those responsible for the PR verification (at MTGOX) have been *hopefully* sacked.

Can confirm; I used to be a server, and the going rate for *almost anything* you leave on the table is a swift delivery to the garbage. Either it's big money, (you're a hero) small money, (you're a jerk) something you left like your phone, keys or gloves, (I won't say what happens) or it's something paper, which goes in the trash almost immediately. 
**EDIT**: If only the Christian crowd could understand this. I've thrown away countless religious materials in my years as a server. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 05:25:45
Ahhhh I see what you're saying. Though a voucher based purchase system where all purchases are made via Bitcoin and received as a USD amount would be awesome. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 03:03:05
Aaaand boom. It's centralized at that point. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 13:22:51
Good guy digdan. I like your way of doing things. 
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:11:10
Don't intend to argue; just contend that he's not a "crook" as you assert. I just don't get why you insist on calling him a crook when he didn't steal anything. 
No need to quarrel, though. Good day, fellow Redditor. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:28:22
Ex PR guy here, can confirm, their press release is not what people want to see/hear after an event with the magnitude of yesterday's. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:42:54
Seems like the only issue he had was buying a Lenovo. ;-) I kid. 
This takes away the reservations I had and I'll probably start buying there. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:50:22
True but I think a decent amount of people are to the point of "hey I should scan this." Especially with so many marketing and contests being conducted this way through Taco Bell, Walmart, etc.
