We hear you! We just relaunched our iOS app (which granted doesn't include bitcoin right now) and Android is next! We wanted to work the kinks out on iOS first...hehe. We will let everyone know as soon as we have a target launch date for Android.

Hi. We do offer the same triple points on bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin payments. However, the ADDITIONAL 3% discount we announced here is for bitcoin only, so hopefully you will stay true to your word and use us now! 
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:50:15
Awesome! Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-09-03 19:50:30
Thanks for the feedback!

We don’t know what goes into the decision process from each brand, so your guess is as good as ours. What we do know is that we kept working hard to get it done and finally got the official word today.  We are pretty excited!
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:59:16
Ouch. Sorry about that, we will add it to the next release and make sure its not forgotten on the current rebuild of the Android app

I'll take that as a compliment, I think. Thanks, and enjoy!

Hi guys,
Thanks for your concern. Rest assured, **NO, we do NOT store passwords in plaintext**. I cannot emphasize this enough.
We do send back the user's password in Forgot Password emails - but this does not mean we are keeping them in plaintext - they are 2-way encrypted in our database.
We do appreciate the concern, and to prevent future concerns about this, we are implementing a Reset Password feature with a 1-way encryption instead.
@_date: 2013-09-13 22:19:53
Glad to hear you had a great experience!
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:11:34
Hi DTanner! To the best of our knowledge, our eGift Cards are only usable in stores and websites based in the United States. Such US-based sites may allow you to use our eGift Cards to ship to Canada, but unfortunately we don't have a list at this time about which brands allow this. We'll let you know when we know more!
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:15:47
Sorry to hear that! We're looking into it right now and see the transaction completed on our end, but I'm going to PM you to make sure you get your card.
@_date: 2013-09-13 23:42:01
Private messaging you right now to try to resolve this. Sorry for the inconvenience! 
@_date: 2013-09-14 00:40:02
Thanks for the feedback! I'm passing your suggestions up the chain. You guys will be the first to know when we bring new brands on board!
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:07:50
You guys asked us for more ways to turn your Bitcoin into real world purchases - especially groceries - so today we added Walmart as one of our 100+ brands. Buy Walmart Gift Cards for yourself, or as a gift for a friend. 
Don't forget to tell us what other gift cards you'd like to be able to buy with Bitcoin at eGifter!

Hi, reddit bitcoiners!
eGifter is really excited to announce that starting today, we are accepting Bitcoin on [eGifter.com](  and on the eGifter mobile app for [Android]( and [iOS]( The payments are processed through our partner Coinbase. Now you can use Bitcoin to send any of our 100+ eGift Cards to your friends and family, or buy eGift Cards for yourself. For in-store redemption, eGift Cards can be used right from eGifter mobile app, or you can print and bring them to the store.
Reply and let us know what you think of the experience. We value any feedback, especially from the reddit community!
@_date: 2013-09-13 20:01:39
Thanks for asking! When you make a purchase through us, you're buying an eGift Card for the restaurant, which essentially acts the same as a normal plastic gift card. Any unused balance remains on the card, and there's no expiration date.
You can either print it out and take it along, or open it on the eGifter mobile app and have it scanned right off your smartphone. Hope this helps!

Thanks for your help - we really appreciate it. Our own research also led us to bcrypt, and earlier today we rolled out a complete revamp of our password storage and reset system. You can read more about it [here](
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:12:34
Sorry you had an issue, but glad we could help!
@_date: 2013-08-27 18:42:57
Currently our mobile app only allows social logins - but we're adding email-based logins to the mobile app, and that will roll out very soon.
In the meantime, you can get the full experience without needing a social login on our website -  Hope this helps!
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:28:47
Thanks for the great suggestions! I'll make sure to pass these up the ladder. :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:05:37
Thanks for helping us improve our system. 
Earlier today we rolled out a complete revamp of our password storage system that follows best practices (storing only hashes), with a short-lived password reset link sent via email. You can read more about it [here](
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:31:59
Yes! We sell eGift Cards - not physical gift cards - and they can be used in-store either by printing them out or showing them on your smartphone (if you have the eGifter mobile app, and phone reception).
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:56:08
