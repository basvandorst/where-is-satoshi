How do you clone a Trezor? That’s a great idea.

I’m having a really bad-rough day. I opened the Reddit app on my phone to kill some time before a meeting I’m not looking forward to and this made me crack-up with laughter. Thanks.

IS this a good idea? Won't they be able to manipulate the crypto-space?

Question. Out of that 1.89623623384 BTC how much does the miner make?
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:26:15
Dam! I held back. I did buy my 3rd one at $1867. The goal was to have 5. I really thought it would gone down a lot lower then $1867 around Aug 1st. Now I feel like I stepped on my dick. I can only hope for one more dip to get it but that will only get me one.

Amazing how my sat nights have changed in 20 years. 20 years ago I would be getting ready to go out to bar then hit the clubs....fast forward to now...watching bitcoin rise.

Well if I ever became a target for a home invasion I can tell you this. My drywall guy would be coming over the following day replacing the Sheetrock with buck shot rounds that never hit my intended target. And the bitcoin is safe regardless��

Bought at $2742 and I already made money...

I agree. I cannot see that happening regardless how much I would want that. But if it did could one sell it off for US FIAT? Could an exchange handle payouts of a million dollars?
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:30:58
Yes it is. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 01:57:59
Holy! Sh!! That's sick!
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:18:25
Yes this is a long term investment. To trade I would of never bought it at that price.
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:27:40
If there's any truth in the world this is it! Literally!
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:20:22
take it easy. why you so angry? I was just stating a fact and Im new to the crypto so just asking. Sorry if I ruined your day!!!
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:51:44
So I'll be losing my money? Then I should dump BTC if that's going to happen. Regardless if I put them on a hard wallet I'll still lose what I invested? What a crock!

Love my Trezor wallet. Great investment! I can sleep at night.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:20:33
So why is everyone saying to remove the BTC onto hard wallets if the result will be the same in the end. I was under the impression that moving coins to hard wallets protects them from the split.
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:48:43
Your right. I know how I am and I would regret it. So I rolled the dice and bought another one.
