Unfortunately, our payments partner for international USD and GBP SWIFT-transactions (deposits and withdrawals) have suffered from prolonged service interruptions. Because of that, any withdrawals through them have been cancelled and deposits returned to the originating bank account. We should indeed have notified all affected clients about this, but alas we didn't. 
We do not currently support withdrawing or depositing via checks (and I very much doubt that we ever will as it is work-intensive, insecure and costly to support), so that is not an option. I can assure you that we are not happy about this either as it puts a portion of our clients "out into the cold" with regards to funding options. We are however actively working on establishing alternatives for international funding options, but I cannot share anything beyond that.
If you wish, please DM me your ticket number and I will have a look into it as soon as possible.

We have not stopped withdrawals and deposits. This is a temporary issue that we are aware of, working to troubleshoot and resolve. 
 
A work-around in the mean time is to simply hold off on depositing or withdrawing or attempt to load the relevant pages again a few times.

Sorry about any confusion and irritation caused, I am the support agent that addressed your issue. As says I have indeed made a mistake here. The issue was not that the bank account information was incomplete, but that the account number contained the following after the actual account number:
    Transit+acc\' 
This resulted in our payments partner returning the account number as invalid and the withdrawal being marked as failed on our end. I have recently updated your support ticket about this, so please check it out.

Sorry to hear that you've been waiting that long. We are quite backlogged and response times are higher than normal. We are doing our best to scale our support team upwards and fight the backlog, but it will take time. 
Regarding your ticket, please give me your ticket number and I can get it escalated or personally look into it. This counts for you, as well!
