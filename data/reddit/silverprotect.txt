Not everybody sees Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme or investment. Most of us missed that boat anyways. And no matter how much potential I see in Bitcoin, you shouldn't invest money you can't afford to lose. I can't afford to lose much at the moment so I'm not putting in as much as I would like. 
If it would hit 2k I would get my initial investment out and keep the remainder in BTC.

Verdorie! Almost got it.
What words did I miss?


I was left over with these letters and was trying to make a sentence with it. Clever you knew it was a person. Congrats :)

Thank you for doing this. I was just a bit too late it seems, but now I have Circle installed on my phone so I might decide to use it as my daily driver.
Keep up the good work!

A little help for all the newcomers wondering whether they should buy in now or wait:
-Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.
-Don't take investment advice from people holding said investment.
-Don't daytrade.

Allright, going to set it all up on my server now then. Let's see how well it works. :)

It has happened multiple times in the past small transactions being send to hundreds of addresses. It's assumed somebody wants to verify whether or not addresses are active and track where those coins are going. You're most likely one of them.

It's at best, often, especially during busy moments I hit way less, to the point where watching Youtube becomes impossible.

You're the best!
