A little hijack here but can a similar thing be done on electrum to electrum?
I currently have an electrum wallet and want to upgrade to a segwit wallet so i think i need to open a new wallet to do so. Can i import without having to send and spend transaction fees from my old electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:51:45
No, it isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:40:10
Thanks for this!
Is there an easy way to do this and transfer using the same device say?
So create a new wallet on my phone and transfer from the wallet on my phone to the new wallet on my phone.
Is there any point?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:02:38
This is retarded, even for this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:22:11
I have electrum 3.0 on android and ive just checked this and all my addresses start with a 1.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:02:33
It absolutely isn't.
However it can appear to have more use or value to them at times.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:13:11
Its down to the potential volatility and immediacy of need.
Thats why it is only 6 months worth.
You are right in several ways re: bluechip dividends but they are not absolutely infallible. Common sense would say you are absolutely right. But in reality a straight savings account is the most basic easily accessible and stable version for immediate cash need.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:20:32
All it shows is support at 3k.
The drops triggered the 3k buy orders and the rest is a wave ride.

Slight hijack.... Is blockchain.info  safe to keep my coin?
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:13:07
Would you prefer left right up or down?
The statement holds true no matter what amount of coins you have.. Within obvious reason.
What exactly do you feel is so unreasonable about what i said?
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:12:55
It's absolutely fine to be using BTC for capital gain. I am using it to make money (and the occasional purchase in the US from the UK). Being in strictly for the money isn't anything to be ashamed of.
It is just the HODLHODLHODL meme is retarded. It goes in the face of utilising common sense and makes those using it look like they know next to nothing over ambitious teenages, when actually some of them are probably pretty knowledgeable
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:38:20
Well that is reasonable.
But that is the point i am making. You are literally the 1% who what i was saying doesn't apply to as you are actively 'using' the bitcoin.
It is the HODL cult and the poor advice they bring that are ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:44:14
Thanks for the explanation of what a meme is, i honestly had no idea. If only i could have you around to hold my hand as i navigate this newfangled Internet! 
And no, What you have described is HOLDING.
Transposing a letter doesn't do anything to the definition and use of the term but consign the user to looking less intelligent than they actually are. It is the textual equivalent of saying MY WIFE in a Borat-esq voice and thinking you sound cool. 
The transposition of one letter and using your 'new' word to have the exact same meaning as the modified word is not anything that should be applauded or thought of as an ideology. 
Regardless of what popular opinion on this subreddit may be.
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:08:52
I'm assuming you are in a warzone or currency unstable country?
Especially if you are feeling threats to your money and wanting to quickly get across borders.
In which case fair enough as i said... If you are not western developed world btc will play by different rules.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:00:59
Hard 'something' means there is no wiggle room. A hard limit means it cant be extended a hard no means definitely not etc. 
There's no chip, its an algorithm.
There is a limit to how many btc can be mined, its more akin to mining a resource rather than printing money which is something that can be increased.
So once the limit is reached that is it no more btc can be mined.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:46:34
Why? 
Don't you enjoy sounding like an uneducated teen?
Don't you enjoy looking like you have been hit in the head by a 2x4?
Dont you enjoy constantly typing HODLHODLHODL just HODL!
Yea its fucking retarded.
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:35:40
Pick your poison... Literally.
Personally i would go with grape laced with cyanide for a bit of a kick!
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:39:01
Its a meme that has become popular based on a typo of Hold.
It makes probably reasonable people should like they are clueless 15 year olds.
HODL HODL HODL!
Unpopular opinion but, It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:54:12
I dont have a huge amount to be honest and im not going to buy a hardware wallet. Atm for me paper wallets are a bit too clunky so would prefer to have online.
Im more concerned atm about how these forks will affect me.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:42:16
Good financial planning would have 6months worth of liquid cash available in an emergency fund that can cover all your major outgoing sin that time... Bills, mortgage, fuel etc.
Everything else should be invested in longer term higher accruing stores.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:02:43
Id say this response shows someone significantly more cognitively challenged.
If people dont know.. Help dont be an ass.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:40:22
See my (probably) buried post. It's actually a reasonable balance of up and down but the replies give you an idea of the mentality of those who use 'Hodl'.
I always read it and think neckbeard.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:04:29
Well thats what it is.
21,000,000 coins based on a mathematical progression.
The last coin will be mined circa 2140.
The newer altcoins tend to be very different things designed to overcome limitations that bitcoin has.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:12:21
Why would i upvote someone who cant spell hold?
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:39:41
Do you like to wave at things as the pass you by?
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:58:41
Of course it is more than that.
However, im sorry but you talk about those things like they are going to happen or affect the average Joe. The could.. But in the chances are slim to none.
Talking about it in that way makes you sound like a doomsday prepper, the 'i dont subscribe to your idea of laws so they dont apply' sovereign citizen guys or the over the top 'edc guy' who Carries a backup knife in case his backup knife needs a backup (and im not trying to be offensive just to illustrate a point) 
There are people who may rely on bitcoin in this way:
Their currency fluctuates wildly
Countries with genuinely unstable government/hyperinflation (i.e. Venezuela) 
People who move countries a significant amount/expats
Illicit activity
But 99% of people using this subredit.. Those shouting HODLHODLHODL! are holding because it will make money in the long run....
And to make it clear.. **There is absolutely no shame in that aim**... Which is where i then cycle back to the OP and reiterate every point i made there.
But all the best to you and i hope whatever evil government you are under doesn't freeze your assets completely whilst simultaneously raising inflation go the point where you cant buy a loaf of bread.
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:43:25
Hodl means you have poor grasp of the English language.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:26:53
A bit of logic based speculation.
3000 is a round number low enough to trigger a buttload of buy orders placed for when the price hits 3k.
Again speculative but sound reasoning.
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:00:28
Just responding to the comments you are making my friend.
You read something wrong, posted a comment, got called on it and doubled down - several times.
Its easy to be full of yourself when you are correct and the other person keeps going.*thumbs up*.
Please feel free to continue though.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:17:34
Not new... Just not retarded.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:41:11
Why ask for advice when it seems very clear from your response that you are looking for validation of the choice you want to make which is to hold.
The smart option as reiterated by many is to pay back the loan.
It eliminates any risk and variances in the market negatively affecting you.
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:31:51
Its a great premise.
Spend loads of money on BTC.
Hold.. Die. What an investment.
I mean grade A-super smart financial planning.
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:18:54
If you hold forever then you make nothing.
Crypto is so volatile. Now this is not to say i dont think bitcoin still has traction. But blind faith is poor.
And also if you are saying that bitcoin is the only way of protecting your money you have been really poorly advised as diversity would be critical to that.... unless you do so happen to be in the minority in here outside of the 'western developed world' so to speak.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:15:57
Because you sound like a completely reasonable individual who is not 12!
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:36:56
You too can look illiterate for the low, low price of $19.99!
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:13:33
Im talking about koolaid in the cult sense.
Im not saying i dont believe in the currency doing well.
I am saying that too many of the posts lately along with sentiment boils down to echo chamber mentality.
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:42:12
Why do like 90% of posts on this sub seem to be written by or linked by someone who is seemily about to offer me a solo cup of koolaid.
Bitcoin isnt fucking life its a high risk investment and should always be treated and approached as such (unless this isnt cared about and you are happy to freely use as currency in short term) 
This doesn't need to be a support group.. Clueless people telling the equally clueless to 'HODL!' on repeat like retarded children... May as well start putting it in 1337speak kids.... With a small amount of reasonable people in between saying to be careful with the currency and use it how and when you wish. 
Holding forever wont make you money. Being sensible is key.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:33:35
I don't understand the mentality of adults who cannot use the word 'hold'. Yet instead choose a stupid meme.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:23:59
It probably could, and that is grand.
But that wasn't why you posted it, nor does it impact the chain of comments after.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:55:43
Well... It's not a reality unless i really missed something!
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:26:12
Will there be issues leaving my btc on blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:48:34
So explain how buying holding til you die helps that?
Actually exchanging and using bitcoin helps.
Holding does nothing but take currency out of circulation not helping the ideal at all.
And if you are saying you dont care about its value and ARE indeed using it then you have validated my sentiment.
You are spending and using  
You are investing and holding to sell as an investment in one form or another  
Or you are collecting some stupidly expensive strings of letters and numbers.
There is no 4th option. This t-shirt is option 3.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:39:58
Do you like to wave at things as the pass you by?
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:06:12
They cant. it is a hard limit
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:02:07
They really do.
Thanks for taking the time to look me up!
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:55:17
You missed the boat on small investments being able to make millions.
A small investment like yours is not likely to yield anything lifechanging.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:32:51
Regardless of the reason, surely that doesn't change the legality?
If it is 3000 per calendar day then that's the rules regardless of intent?
It would be the equivalent of moving a load of money around to take advantages of tax advantages the day before the tax year ends then moving more the day after. 
Unless it was per 24hr period in which case its different.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:26:31
r/commonsense  
No trying to look smart about it. If you consider having a rudimentary grasp of a language 'really smart', how do you view nobel prize winners, gods?
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:00:36
Read back your own words and consider if you have given me any reason to think otherwise.
But please enlighten me how an ill placed attempt at a 'your mom' 'joke' implies an understanding of the situation at hand.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:26:52
I'm am unfortunately aware of the shitpost that started the shitty meme.
Apparently considerably more so than your concept of context.
**The most brilliant part is that your post i am replying to actually justifies the already relevant comment i made about waving at things.**
**To drag you out of the haze, to refer to somebody waving at something as it passes them by is a reference to them not understanding or comprehending what was said.**
**In this case, you clearly not reading into the context, my clear understanding of what this 'hodl' bollocks is and the accompanying post dripping in sarcasm.**
Maybe you should consider the whole reading game before jumping on that horse of yours and chastising others.
But thank you for your input anyway.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:24:33
Hodl is for teenage kids into fads who think memes are super cool.
The whole concept goes against the basis of BTC as a currency.
Added bonus of making people that may have a reasonable understanding and intelligence sound like morons.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:48:31
Well that's very nice of you and all a little kindness goes a long way with older folks. 
But you clearly still don't understand, if you would like me to slow things down and clear things up a little bit for you, just let me know and i will be happy to help!
