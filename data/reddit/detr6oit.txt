I was able to send out my $10 right away.  It sent it with no delay also.

Yup just a few months ago.  Must be randomized and not in order.

Yeah I got one too and also got the $10 in BTC.  Was surprised to see it finally come though.

Downtown is booming. When was the last time you were there?  I can't even keep track of all the new bars and restaurants opening up anymore.  Even events like slow roll every bring 1500-3000 people down every week to just to ride bikes around.  Pricing on real estate around the downtown core has multiplied by 10 in a few areas.  On top of that there is a rental shortage in downtown and pricing is jumping insanely fast as well. That is even with multiple brand new developments and redevelopments of old properties.

A good set up for this is to just have USB drive with a wallet.  A PDF of a paper wallet on there is pretty simple and she can keep the USB drive in a safe place.  Then on her phone set up another wallet and enter the USB drive's address as a watch address so she can still look at her Bitcoin in a safe way on her phone while she is learning.  Can even put a small spendable on the phone to mess with.

Tree services often pay to dump their wood.  Obviously this depends on your region and how wooded it is. Call them up and they may drop it off to you for free.  Downside is that its not cut at good fire place lengths and needs to be spit still.
