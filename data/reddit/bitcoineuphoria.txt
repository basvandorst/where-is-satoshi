I am putting together a website where Doctors can list their practice in a directory so patients can find MDs that accept bitcoin. PM me if you'd like to be listed.

You're right, there are a whole host of ways to exploit this dude.

I'm not making a judgement on who is better at shipping (However, I will say there are stats available for grading reliability, but you can google that yourself.)
My point is you shouldn't be sending paper wallets in the mail at all. Fedex, ups, ontrac, DHL, and usps included.

The article and the video are only pro-bitcoin to the extent that bitcoin is a lot more nuanced than just being a good currency or a bad currency. 
I suggest you actually discuss the contents not the motivation of the article.
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:36:49
Haha, that's pretty funny. Sounds like you're better off than the guy I helped. But even still, one can never be to careful. That's still a bit more public than I'd like to be, but I guess we all weigh risk differently.

When human error and bias can be taken out of the question. You streamline the way we facilitate communication and trade. The fundamentals backing bitcoin should be the topic of discussion. Not whether something is good or evil like Paul Krugman's article says. We have to broaden our view of the building blocks. Once that happens people like Krugman will be forced to study up before they are taken seriously.

Hey there, Shoreditch's Unofficial American Bitcoin PR Guy here, this is not the Old Shoreditch Station, but another cafe called the Sawmill: 
@_date: 2014-07-04 16:56:24
The point of that comment was this: I am an honest person and snapping a photo is one of many ways that a less honest person could have exploited him.

Who better to make a comment on the unused features of the bitcoin protocol than Mike Hearn? Missing your point... Nonetheless it seems you must not have read the whole article. It's an op ed piece about a talk that was given last year. I am by no means positioning this as news.
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:04:45
Is writing an op ed piece in response to another foreign to you?
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:24:50
The video and the article which you have clearly not watched or read point out unused features in the bitcoin protocol. Where Paul Krugman makes a value statement, about whether bitcoin is good, bad or purple, Mike Hearn has taken the time to study the bitcoin protocol and is reporting on dormant features. Nothing more nothing less.
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:25:27
Innovation always scares those satisfied with the status quo, Paul Krugman's stirring remarks got a lot of headlines, but does he forget so quickly the apprehension of credit card payments on the web? How about Paypal, it took them years to build steam and gain trust. 
When you are afraid to look forward and challenge old schools of thought you get laws like the anti-Uber/LeCab laws passed recently in France. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:53:52
While I understand where you are coming from, I would contend that the protocol is just a protocol. Attaching human qualifiers to it leads to the wrong kind of discussion, both on the pro and con side.
@_date: 2013-06-25 22:46:54
Yeah a huge barrier to entry these days. I am pretty sure that the costs of registering as a money transmitter are in the 7 figure range...
@_date: 2013-06-06 11:21:33
Care to elaborate? Are you asking about the transactions that have a tendency to clog the blockchain like SatoshiDice? Or the idea of small transactions used to validate and curate content for independent creators?
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:56:19
Hey nice idea!
I was at LeWeb London 2013, where the Burning Man founder Larry Harvey spoke about what part web and technology plays for burning man. Way to bridge gaps!
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:27:34
Amazing work. Thanks for your time and energy. Considering some of the other lucky few who received btc from BCB, you've proven to be the most worthy IMO. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:11:42
What's the deal with all the butterfly lab rigs in these pics. Does this help to confirm the rumor that BFL is holding off on sending their rigs so that they can profit while btc prices are high?
@_date: 2013-06-25 22:01:10
Which one do you think would be most receptive? Are you receptive? Or do you think it's a bad idea?
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:37:28
Thanks for the breakdown, but the reason I ask is to do away with the steps you describe. it would be a lot easier to have the option I described.

Love, the insight here. Very well thought out. Pair this with the exchanges allowing the ability for traders to short the bitcoin and we have a much more stable market. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:23:50
Very true, I didn't notice that until you pointed it out. I'll send him a tweet.

One of my biggest in fact.

His calm and composure are a breath of fresh air. That guy Tom Keene is a freaking troll.

No, just a humble enthusiast.

You can always hope, right?
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:05:03
Awesome! I'm really looking forward to the bitcoin presentations. Rodger, no need to give any secrets away, but will there be any announcements? Or did you leave everything on the table at Bitcoin 2013?
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:51:32
I guess you didn't read my note at the bottom of my post...

Ehhhh. It may get to the point where they have to adopt it... Not to endorse Rypple but there is room for both to co-exist.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:26:40
Enjoy that.

I just installed the plugin on my own site and realized I had a problem. If you, like me, collect content from around the web and repost it on your site using the plugin in its current form is a little risky. By collecting tips on a reposted article you're kind of stealing from the original author... So I went ahead and deactivated the plugin. I wrote about some suggestions here: 
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:09:58
What about specifically in the UK? Any issues with these options?
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:59:08
Yep, a segment: Moderated by Martin Bryant, Managing Editor, The Next Web
Anthony Gallippi, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, BitPay Shakil Khan, Head of Special Projects, Spotify Roger Ver, Founder &amp; CEO, MemoryDealers.com
I'll try and find the video once it's uploaded.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:23:12
There's always buying and selling local...
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:58:34
You make sound as if these efforts are mutually exclusive. Both will happen and both are good. I'm tried of hearing the it's one or the other rhetoric.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:32:22
BCB needs to weigh in and lend some support on this one. It's in his best interest to keep those donations strong!
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:32:39
Yeah, but 20% time is still authorized by his bosses. So Google is essentially paying him to work on Bitcoin. Why would they do that without expecting some form of product. Granted it may never see the light of day. But some really pivotal Google products have come out of 20% time. Maps anyone???? So yeah, I bet that his findings find their way to a VP within the Wallet cohort and they live or die on that desk. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:46:53
ACH could be a viable option or wire transfers.
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:07:05
As a Merchant I would love to give this option to clients, so that they can easily make a payment through traditional means and I can receive the payment in bitcoin minus BitPay's fees. Hell I would pay a a higher fee so that I could have incoming USD converted into a mix of Bitcoin and USD.
@_date: 2013-07-18 21:05:05
I wish I could. Keep getting this error: 
"There was a problem loading the map data.
Please check your internet connection, or try zooming in.

Careful: There's a Phishing scam going around. [They're using the DDoS attack as a way of tricking people](
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:03:24
Hitler. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:43:13
No, the client could easily pay via Wire or ACH. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:10:43
Obviously this is an option but as a merchant he needs the price protection and the convenience. That's why it's necessary for him to deal through a bitpay.com or a bips.me.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:41:57
I wonder how long before companies stop lumping e-currencies into the same bucket. It's only a matter of time before that's not good enough as a catch all term.  
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:30:08
Yeah, E-money is a pretty broad definition and maybe for the time being a place holder. But should Google wish to change their TOS to be more specific it would be rather easy. Given that they have a Googler authorized to work on bitcoin with his 20 percent time means that Google sees value, you've got to wonder, who is this guy interfacing with at the company for general policy advice and what not. I'd be willing to bet that Mike Hearn has many a discussion with the Google Wallet team.
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:07:35
I would settle for bank wire/transfer, forget that I said credit cards, it would be a nice option.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:46:36
So scammy looking... Ick.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:39:20
Exactly. I've even messaged them about it. They seem uninterested.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:43:37
Thanks but I'll have to regretfully decline to that option. I do hope you understand... ;)
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:08:51
That's true, but CNN will continue to cover bitcoin more frequently if there is more grassroots Bitcoin organizing.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:36:25
Isn't that just a job board? I may end up signing up, so thanks for that, but it's not quite what I am looking for. I am looking for a third party to process payments for me. Think Bitpay but for Service vendors.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:23:50
Exactly, it's all a part of the same dynamic. But people should note that if they use a plugin that generates a new donation address for each post (what I wrote about, if you click through above,) it's more than just passive ad-ploitation, it's making specific traceable profit from work that wasn't yours.  
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:53:41
Who say's it's gloating? If the top 20 apps for iOS have gone months without their marketing material updated I'd say its poor brand management both on their end and the community as a whole.
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:11:15
Hey, nobody is saying you might, but I can think of a whole bunch of folks over the age of 50 who might only ever interface with bitcoin if it's under the umbrella of a google/amazon/ebay type. Sometimes it takes the big dawgs to embrace an idea before it becomes standard.

Ah a man of few words. Care to elaborate?

I'd love to help! I just started a bitcoin news aggregator and blog. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:49:34
Don't take my little call to action as the whole scope of what I think will make bitcoin great. I'm okay with people discovering bitcoin now, I don't really get your take on the two being mutually exclusive. I'm all for developers to continue to innovate, but nothing drives innovation quite like demand. I not calling for an inflation of expectations I simply calling for good brand management.

Not really, Coinbase seems to function rather well without being a "bank" while utilizing ACH.
