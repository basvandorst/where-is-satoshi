Wow dude, look at your profile. See a pattern in your comments?

The argument I am trying to make is that when it costs 50 bucks to withdraw from coinbase and other places will be 5 bucks to open channel and then near zero fee per transaction it will be pretty hard for bad nodes like coinbase to keep it's business.

Jesus Christ give them money or they will lose the BTC. Don't make mistakes with that kind of money

More likely the would be someone third party (like PayPal or Visa equivalent) that you as a customer have open channel to and the vendor as well.
Just like the vendor is most likely to use a point of sales system from a vendor rather than making their own there is going to be trusted third party(ies) for payments.

Coinbase is fine, all major excuses somewhat suck so make sure to get trezor or ledger and keep your seed backed up and offline.
Do your research, don't lose it. There are articles all over the internet so start reading.

Also we need everyone using segwit, right now blocks can take in much more transactions already. And lightning of course.

The will open up the source:
eelo is a non-profit project, in the public interest, and will be open source. 
We're still early stage though, and we want to release quality stuff. So we will release source code on GitHub as soon as we are ready to unveil first eelo products.

Apple is already under pressure to build backdoors to their devices.
Having a secure OS alternative would be great for making sure people have options to choose from.
You might also want to have the confidence someone looked at the code, which you can't do with closed source OS.

This is Bitcoin subreddit, not general crypto one.
I used to have a bunch of alts, sold everything for BTC and haven't looked back. If you want my opinion, I suggest you do the same.

Porting over smart contacts from ETH. Asking companies with relevant smart contacts to Port theirs.

Afaik kraken are the good guys so while I expect them to perhaps not comment officially for a while I expect them to do the right thing.

Go half and half, (half now, half DCA, or wait for decent drop)  or third now,  third into alts (LTC, eth, and some small amount to whatever you fancy) and third waiting for a drop.

Maybe we should have our own crypto Nobel prize alternative.

None of these have developers or community support Bitcoin has. Who cares how many forks are there. I can make 1000 copies of the code today but who cares?
The media and market needs to realise these are worthless.

Watch world crypto network, tone vays and off chain to stay in the know.
Take some profits if the price makes you uneasy. I am watching the long term chart and if we hit 30-40k next year I'll sell some.
Make sure you know how long are you investing for. I am in for at least 5 years before I start selling 5-10% each year. Today's price is not so important to me.
In short - have a plan.

This is gold! I mean.. Bitcoin!

I think it's just a general happiness that comes from rooting for the underdog.
Folks are busy making sidechains and other solutions that will help us scale, put smart contacts on Bitcoin or make anonymous transactions, we should show them some love and support.
(Lightning network, Rootstock, the last one I can't remember)
