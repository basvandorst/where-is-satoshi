Lightning CEO in 2015: [Lightning will be ready in less than 6 months](
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:06:30
How I imagine conversations about bitcoin at a party go:
"So uh, how about those transaction fees hey"
"Yeah, can't wait for lightning"
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:27:53
Uhhh. Pretty sure Jeff Garzik was working on bitcoin well before many of the core devs. And also Gavin Andresen, who was chosen by Satoshi to continue his work, stands behind the BCH devs. So to call it "their work" is insulting to those original oldschool devs.

@_date: 2018-01-03 16:37:26
That tweet makes it clear that Gavin is supporting the BCH devs - and that means a lot when he is one of the very first devs and trusted by Satoshi. I do believe he is still working on other side projects that will help scale BCH too. Graphene is one thing I've heard of. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:00:01
Yes. And Bitcoin is still a gamble.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:09:32
They already did back in August by forking away from this stubborn section of the community.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:37:28
How exactly is solid tech that works as advertised (and better than certain coins) a "scam"?
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:48:09
Uhh.. so is the second one.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:50:34
You implied that BCH devs don't have the same rights to the code of bitcoin because they "forked all their work and contributed very little of their own." 
It was largely their work in the first place.
Hence, calling it "core dev's work" that was copied by the BCH team is insulting and nonsensical. It implies that the BCH devs just ripped off their work without having any originality or talent. Hard to rip off someone else's work when you made it in the first place.

It kinda is actually. It's based off real history and is frequently brought up in political science classes.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:15:16
Elizabeth Stark said lightning would be ready in 6 months in 2015. Kinda hard to believe that it was right around the corner when it has forever been "6-18 months away". Anyway, that's not the point. BCH was created because of an ideological split in the bitcoin community. Core don't believe in onchain scaling, BCH devs do. They have different approaches, so just because lightning may be close to full release doesn't make BCH redundant.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:32:53


You're actually kidding right? Your comment is so ridiculous it sounds like satire.
You know it's open source software which no one "owns" the brand or logo for? You know that Satoshi deliberately designed the code so that anyone has the right to fork the code? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:59:34
Lol. I take it "embellishment" or "creativity" are unfamiliar words for you?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:20:50
Lol. Do you understand how political theory works? They don't just rewrite everything every time there's a new president.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:48:34
Pretty much the same as being in queue for your transaction to leave the mempool too
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:22:47
Lol. Thinking that bitcoin stands a chance against iota in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:57:10


Err... You realise it's the current philosophy that brought us here in the first place right? Maybe it's time to actually scale bitcoin the way satoshi designed, which, interestingly is not the same philosophy of Core.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:00:36
B-but Roger Ver! Jihan Wu! BCASH!!!
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:22:27
lol no
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:40:43
Nah everything else gets censored.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:32:54
There is nothing unique to bitcoin about those features, besides maybe the level of decentralisation, but that's only a result of the popularity of bitcoin. BTC is replaceable. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:21


No he's letting the market play politics. The market now has a very clear choice - onchain scaling with low fees and fast speeds right now, or offchain scaling with high fees and low speeds with tech to reduce that "soon". Core had the chance to make BCH irrelevant by increasing blocksize, but instead they chose their "digital gold for rich people and hodlers" vision. Now let's see what the market does.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:20
How exactly is bitcoin going to show it's "the real deal" to the hoardes of newcomers? Faster transactions and lower fees is going to be hard to beat don't you think?
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:20:47
Lol. You said it yourself, bitcoin is supposed to be open and democratic. By trying to stop people using BCH you are removing openness, freedom and democratic choice. Satoshi included hard forks by design so that people could always have free choice if they didn't like how the blockchain was progressing. Forcing people into only using your preferred chain is just installing yourself as part of a new oligarchy. I will vote with my wallet, as you suggest, and never use your exchange.

@_date: 2017-11-13 07:05:21
By Reddit? Yes, yes they are. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:01:57


Like low fees and high transaction speeds? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:59:47


This is bullshit. There are many people who actually need BTC to be useable right now. Those people where their national currency is hyperinflating and becoming completely worthless. Those people who need to send remittances back to their families overseas, and can't afford the hefty fees that Western Union, traditional bank transfers, and now BTC come with. 
BTC's value comes from it's unique utility as a borderless and native currency for the internet. It doesn't have any intrinsic value like gold does, it's not backed by any party, so it's value depends entirely on it having an actual use. Anyone who thinks otherwise is blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:57:27
If bitcoin is so vulnerable to attack by a single, not very powerful person then maybe it's not so "antifragile"?

"On average, a full-time waiter in a Melbourne or Sydney restaurant can average about $250 to $500 in weekly tips, more for really top-end places, where staff can earn closer to $600 or $700."
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:36:41
People usually just round up the bill and add the tip to their card payment. e.g. a $140 bill would become a $150 payment.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:18:36
Yeah nah. Why would I bother? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:14:16

@_date: 2018-02-23 10:20:32
Uh, yeah. Ask anyone who works at hatted restaurants how much they make from tips. It can be substantial.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:19:58
If you don't realise how easy it is to make money off crypto then you're not as smart as you think. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:32:08
There are quite a few good aussie exchanges with low-ish fees. Btcmarkets, Independent Reserve, Coinjar, ACX, Coinspot.
Don't use Coinbase, their fees are ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:33:22
All you people saying we don't tip... how old are you?
We *generally* don't tip. However at nice, modern dining restaurants tipping is very common.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:17:16
"Is not expected" is not the same as "doesnt happen".
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:51:05


Lol. This shows how ignorant the typical blockstream supporter is. Satoshi conversed frequently in emails and forums about what his vision was. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:43:27


It's already started. Factions are already well developed and no doubt other factions will form in time as well. While everyone is bickering and fighting about forks, something newer and better will take over.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:27:11


At franchises and cafes yeah. At any decent modern dining restaurant it's very common to tip.
Edit: lol yep downvote me for stating the truth. I'm talking proper, sit down dining. If you're poor or from a regional area you wouldn't ever have been to the kind of places I'm talking about.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:32:27
This is a manufactured marketing ploy. Travelbybit is a Brisbane based startup, run by, I'm fairly sure, a Singaporean guy. This is probably his dad/uncle/friend who was talked into a quick trip for the purposes of this story.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:08:50
Yeah, I think people will be stubborn in letting go of bitcoin, so it will hold it's position fairly well for a long time (whichever one is considered the "true" btc), but ultimately it'll become an antique compared to far more convenient, faster and cheaper options that people can actually use on a regular basis.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:18:58
Just calling out a "news" story for what it is.
