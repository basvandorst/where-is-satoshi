That could be great! I really want it to be user friendly. I'll gladly accept any advice or insight you might have.

We made a conscious decision to use python. The code base is a major part of the project and I want it to be as simple as possible.
Yet, using python have some very serious draw backs. It's hard to compile, requires works around many c types obj and lack many crypto libraries.

There are many good implementations out there. I really should pay more attention to them.
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:50:26
And you shouldn't. It's for educational purposes only.

Thank you for your comment!
Alice's hashed public key is specified in the previous transaction. For Alice to claim these coins and send them to Bob, she needs to to sign the transaction and provide her public key - As part of the current transaction (Alice -&gt; Bob). 
@_date: 2016-08-13 08:30:20
Ok, I think I got it.
You're right, not every transaction might have the same requirements. There can be some very interesting and "exotic" transactions as well.
In fact, I'm hoping to write another post that deals with scripts and that will include some of these transactions.

Indeed, keys and people are not always the same, and Alice and Bob are only pseudo identities. 
But when I'm signing a transaction (Alice -&gt; Bob), I'm fulfilling the requirements specified in the previous transaction (Someone -&gt; Alice) using Alice's keys - And this process is transparent and can be validated again and again.

In very general terms: Not all information is equal when calculating the block size, some information isn't directly considered to be part of the transaction and it's sent separately from the legacy transaction. This might give the impression that the transaction size is smaller than what it really is. For (mainly) this reason, another metric was formed, the weight unit. The weight unit is another scale for transactions (and blocks) and is used when determining the new block limit and transaction fees.

I'm planing to look more in depth at the structure of currently accepted transactions in the next posts. But it is somewhat discourage to see that so many scripts are rejected. Still, the concept is something that is worth going through.

I just now had the time to look at this post. It's pure gold! thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:38:46
Thank you for your comment. These are indeed important topics to covers.
Recovering private key, that's an interesting concept I should consider for future classes - I must admit, I never even considered it up until now.
CLTV, I'm not a big fan, and it might be too much for most of the students.
I'm currently teaching transactions (p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh and op_return) using python, and I'm looking for the right approach to do so with JS.
@_date: 2016-10-06 06:17:05
But there are still some limitations. Not all OP_CODES are accepted, and of course the size limitation.
Still, this is definitely something worth to explore in more detail. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:47:59
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:31:04
I completely agree.
That's why I was so against using JS when teaching the protocol rules to the students. But I start to think that one the one hand it might provide a great starting point for students who're more interested in web development, while still being powerful enough to teach it more conceptual level.
Anyway, that's my first impression. And I'm set on trying to explore this path further.
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:33:01
Valid point.
I'm also looking for a more uniform method to deal with different data types without switching different libraries so that the students might have something constant to work with. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:08:15
That looks promising. The code is really detailed and easy follow. We'll definitely look more into it. Thanks!

Thank you for your replay.
Indeed there are many implementations out there. Our implementation isn't the first and it won't be the last. 
I strongly believe that the more resources available out there, the better and it's a good practice for us, and our way to contribute to the Bitcoin community.
Still, Our project does have some merits of its own. For once, We try (as much as possible) to write the code as descriptive and procedural as possible. We really want people to be able to follow it one line at a time. Even print it out and read it on the bus/train. And I also hope that the blog posts and videos will also provide some support to those who wish to learn the matter - Providing the reader with a relatively easy - one step at a time - guide. 
**Basically I'm trying to create the kind of project I wished for  when I was learning the Bitcoin protocol.**
It's a bit rough, we know, and we're working on it.
As for your suggestion, This is something we're deferentially going to cover when we'll talk about transactions and scripts in the coming weeks. 
Your also welcome to have a look at an older video I've recorded a few months ago that explains the process of constructing and signing a transaction.
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:00:00
Thanks, I'm checking in out.
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:45:30
Im glad that you liked it. A few months back I've also created a short video tutorials on how to construct Bitcoin transaction using (almost) raw python code. You're welcome to check it out: 
I hope it will help you to understand the basics.
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:12:27
Thank you all for your nice comments!
We really appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:01:36
Great to hear.
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:08:37
It is a great project. There are many other good python implementations out there. Ours won't be the first one, that's for sure. But we want to build something completely new, from the ground up. Also, we're emphasizing on documentation so that our project will (hopefully) be easy to follow. We want to help others to understand the basics of Bitcoin codding and programming.
@_date: 2016-07-31 18:15:20
Thanks! I'm glad that you liked it.
I hope to get there eventually, but It's still a long way to go. 
Still, you're right. That's what most people are interested in, so maybe I should try to plan accordingly. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:50:08
I'll check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:12:56
Thank you! I appreciate it.
We never though about CodeProject, but it's definitely worth checking out. I'm looking into it right now.
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:19:30
Good luck with that. We'll be waiting.

It seems like you're also aware of the hardships of implementing bloom filters and murmurhash function in python  :)
