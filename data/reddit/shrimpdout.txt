seems like banks and card services are halting bitcoin services, isn't this concerning?

except I can go to any atm right now and get it in cash, use it at any gas station or any other store, that's any store right now. That is one area bitcoin fails miserably. Until this is addressed, bitcoin will be a luxury for fun. I am failing to see how bitcoin is even relevant in today's economy.

Wow, you can lose your money just by upgrading your PC? 
Ive just been researching, but that is a major issue for me. My pc, my os or phone should have no bearing on my ability to maintain my assets. 
Edit: I'm getting down votes here but seriously folks, if updating your os can cause a financial loss in Bitcoin then that is going to prevent Bitcoin from growing. Most people will not put up with that. I personally consider it to be a serious design flaw.

US dollars kind of come close already. I mean this is a fun thing, but not new. I can spend us dollars just about any where. People love the $$$ all around the world.

Using a device is fine, but that device software/firmware should be able to handle updates without loss.

meant software or firmware. I'll edit it. All the storage devices have some kind of code on them.

When the  shoeshine boy talks it's time to sell.

except in this context we are talking about it as a stock, not a currency. 
There has never been a single day I asked, should I hold my dollars or trade them.
