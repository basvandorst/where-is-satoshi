I'm a dabbler in bitcoin, but shouldn't you have some point of exit planned? Obviously, you're not going to hold until the day you die, so what are you waiting for? 2k? 5k? 10k?
I'm legit curious about the difference between stock holders vs BTC holders. I have a lot of money in stocks, but they pay dividends at least as I hold. They also go up in price, and down, just like BTC.
At what point do you say "we're at the moon, time to sell"?

Coindesk makes boatloads of money on people panic-selling (and then later regret-buying back in). The hilarious price they buy or sell coins at compared to the market is pure mafia pricing, plus their official % stated on the website. 
It's a lot better for them to claim the sky is falling and get people to sell and then buy back in. They make money on both ends.

Oh I was going to say the piss bottles.

So does this include all the Chinese BTC trades back and forth to give the impression of volume?
@_date: 2017-02-11 02:37:32
This is terrible advice. Do not ever speculate on investments with borrowed money. No matter how sure you are that it'll go up.

Serious, I just purchased 10 spare phones so that I'm ready for when the OP posts the address that I should be staying away from.

An economic bear trap is and has been a real thing for years.

Not the candlestick chart, I mean charting the historical price of BTC to USD on a log scale. Like in the link I posted.

Agreed. But I would say that anyone using the app is required to have a version of iOS that has the most basic security standards that would dissuade people on it. Same with Android/Windows Phone. I'm not meaning to call out iOS specifically.

I understand paying for the convenience of pressing a button and getting btc. I'm completely fine with that. 
But why the increased price as well as the transaction fee? The transaction fee they state up front as 1.5%, so I'm completely fine with that. Why price the coins $5 more than the tracker that they literally run themselves?
@_date: 2017-01-10 10:37:02
Can you expand on this a little bit? 
I'm looking at bitcoinity.org/markets right now and every single site listed is either at 914 or below (gdax at 914.90 or so). Some as low as 867 for BTC-e. Not that I'm vouching for BTC-e, but I don't see any site listed that's above what gdax is showing. Clicking buy on Coinbase: $919.68!
I find it interesting that every single time I've clicked on the buy link from coinbase, the price I'm quoted is always within a few cents of $5 more than gdax is. 
Let me clarify that a bit: I've clicked the buy link for the last 3 days multiple times a day (5+ over the days hours), and the price is ALWAYS just about $5 above the gdax price. 
I'd be cool with that, except I'm also charged an additional fee on top of the jacked up price for BTC. 
Why are you not double dipping?
EDIT: their buy/sell spreads are pennies off from each other, not dollars. Every single site.

Billions were put in because people expected Trump to push through some tax changes that would be profitable. It's now looking like it won't happen, so money is shifting.

The coins are not actually on your phone, just access to them. If you drop/brick your phone, you should have your passphrase in a secure location. Install breadwallet on a new phone and put in the passphrase.

Coinbase also adds $5/coin to whatever the market value is, so their fee is more than 1.5%. Same with selling, they take off $5/coin. They said this is because of buy/sell contracts or something, but with BTC being fairly stable recently, they're still adding or subtracting $5 per coin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:37:22
That's a question with a lot of answers. I'm sure some is going into crypto, some into foreign markets, some reinvested elsewhere in the US market, and some into other hedges like gold/silver. 
The main point is that we're not looking at a crash. We may be due for a correction since a lot of plans people had for the overseas profit tax holiday and corporate tax changes now are changing.
Then again, I'm not a professional investor. Even professionals get things wrong, too. The article is a bit misleading though with a scary title like that while the dow is sitting pretty close to the ATH. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:45:49
I hate this line of thinking. Yes, an infinite number of man-hours could be put into stealing your coins, but in actuality nobody is going to put in that effort when they could much easier show up with a gun and force you to give up the coins.
iPhone security is more than enough to keep your coins safe.

I'm new to bitcoin, I'm going off advice from another friend who works in finance and told me to expect a dip coming up due to investors getting a bit of cold feet since there are so many days off due to holidays. 
I have no idea how to track if we're at the bottom of the dip or if it's going to skyrocket tomorrow. I bought when I had funds available, that's all I can tell you.
@_date: 2016-12-25 06:43:14
I think mine was at the start until I verified my drivers license
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:35:25
Yeah, that's basically what I assumed. I was hoping to see something in a T&amp;C that I agreed to instead of just a "LOL deal with it" scenario.
I like them because they are super easy to buy from, I guess I need to find a different spot to buy from. As someone who made their first buy and sell in the last month, is there a site that's credible enough that I don't have to be scared about verifying myself, but is also easy to buy/sell/transfer to my breadwallet from?

It's not buying a yacht money, but it is "if you invest it correctly, you can comfortably live off a 50-75k "salary" each year, and still keep the nestegg rolling. 
Depending on where they are in the US (or world), it's at least enough to retire and study what they want or relax, though it's not enough to travel the world.

I signed up with coinbase 2 days ago. $300 limit on credit cards (4% fee) or $5000 limit with ACH transfer (1.5% fee buying, 1.5% selling).
I hope there isn't an "error" with my order :(
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:38:00
It's a dip because of the holidays. Do NOT sell right now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:54:53
That doesn't work when you're releasing it in the same world where car batteries, starters, and push-button ignition already exist. Your company would be out of business immediately.

I clicked before looking which subreddit this was posted in. Laughed when the BTC symbol showed up.

If it wasn't an april fools joke, I wouldn't be too opposed to a limited form of this. 
"Hey, we're not charging for access to the site, but if you read more than 5 pages, we're going to run a java miner for 30 seconds as part of our pool, here's a timer in the corner so you can see when we start and when we stop."
Less invasive than ads, and the site still gets paid.

I WANT TO BELIEVE
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:30:35
Everyone's all "wait and buy the dip, ok here's the dip" but the price was this low 3 freakin days ago. Why didn't you just buy 3 days ago?

This is not a house bought with bitcoin, it was bought with cash. Just because the money was held in bitcoin at some point does not mean it was a bitcoin trade.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:28:15
Can you just buy like 5 times in a row, a day apart each time. I could use some $5 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:30:32
And you could have lost it all on the flip side. It's easy to look back and say something like that.
Here's another one... why didn't you invest every cent you had in Apple when the iPhone was released? Or Google? Or any number of other things that went up massively in price.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:07:57
Only if you make it more dakka.

I hate to be the naysayer, but if the US banking system fails, there's not going to be a calm transition to bitcoin... There is going to be a complete breakdown of the entire social structure. 
It'll be like Mad Max, numbers in a computer aren't going to mean anything, if there's even the internet around to keep the blockchain going.
I'm all about making money, but lets live in reality.
