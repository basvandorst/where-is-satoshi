Thanks for the info. This is why I think looking at addresses is only one part and cannot be taken as a good guess alone. I would also be interested if there is analysis from other "goods" how they are distributed. For example stocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:30:18
Interesting estimates. The question is how often people distribute their coins over multiple adresses. So it could potentially still be over 16000 people.
On the other hand, it is also possible that most of these addresses are used by only a handful of people. So it is really difficult to make something out of this number.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:22:28
At least hypothetically computers could check for that. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:56:24
Great! I will need some time to read and understand all of this. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 23:21:48
I would value your arguments more if you would just mentioned them and not use this language and personal attacks. I am just wondering what your real problem with him is now. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 18:05:03
Thanks for this information.
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:38:45
Obviously he wants to make the most out of that insider information. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:31:28
Unfortunately too many services are accepting SOFORT. I do not understand how this is so much supported. I mean I get why Shops are choosing it, because they save the fees from PayPal. But banks and users should not accept such a thing.
Edit: double "and" 
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:54:56
Greet her also from Switzerland. She has done a very good job here!
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:31:42
Only as long as as the liquidity is small compared to the demand on the exchanges.
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:19:43


Explain please.
I can see this, when others would want to buy/sell bitcoins. But when a lot of coins are being used to pay goods/salaries etc. it might not be true anymore.
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:09:31
Done. 
Edit : I sent a coffee, but he doesn't have an account yet. And maybe he doesn't check his Twitter at the moment due to the heat. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:30:24
Better try a changetip chain. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 07:04:51
Happy cakeday. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:54:27
She's the real gentleman and Queen of digital currency. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:45:57
My Twitter shows my local time. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 08:28:01
When did you last talk with somebody from Gox? Any News?
I guess for legal reasons they are afraid to tell you anything.
But maybe tomorrow we can withdraw a couple of coins...
@_date: 2014-07-31 12:07:57
It was only partially serious. 
Of course if bitcoin really crashes, they will have a problem. But if many businesses hold a lot of bitcoin, price would be quite stable ;-) And if a business holds many coins and price only varies a little, it is no huge problem. And price rarely falls over 50%. And when you had your coins before the bubble the drop will also not be that heavy for you as a business.
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:32:08
You know your way with words and how to make the magic happen. Great post!
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:53:09
I think a lot of people don't subscribe but still visit daily. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 14:54:16
Yep. Maybe he contacted everyone from the tip thread of yesterday? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:55:40
I know all of you guys want gox to die. But can I have my coins back first...? 
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:49:03
Forward him my few bits please. 
500 bits private 
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:01:31
Ok thanks. Then maybe it will also reach Germany. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:54:54
Yes, it should be possible to make tipping comments private. Because normal threads really blow up when a lot of tipping is present.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:44:10
Which is really sad. As the country which will be the "Switzerland of Bitcoin" will profit economically. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:24:38
Too much. And also my first coins, so my biggest "win". 
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:02:28
I hope for the people of Cyprus that this will be a success story for your country and a role model for others. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:07:31
Maybe the Finma isn't through with the bureaucracy for that case yet...
Treat every operator separately.

20$ for international shipping is quite a lot. I would also just buy an ebook if possible. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 11:44:33
That is very helpful for all cities. Will bookmark it, thank you!
And yes, I have heard about his recent success in keeping the streets clean: 
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:16:56
The fiat currency price should change.. not the bitcoin ;-)
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:28:58
I agree with your general statement. But as a business and a touristic traveler I am pretty happy with every additional place accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-15 09:01:54
There is also some etiquette on how to behave which might be useful for changetip as well. Also remember that the word "private" right after changetip disables the reply from changetip and makes a thread less flooded. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:15:52
When you want to do it with changetip, you will need to know an account of the person you want to tip on one of the pages changetip support at the moment. So for example youtube, twitter or reddit. When you have this account you can easily tip with your account on this site. So the person will see the account you are using. But that is all that is known, and you can obviously set up an anonymous account. 
If you no a wallet address of the person, obviously you can tip directly bitcoin and then it will be even more "anonymous".
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:43:44
Absolutely! Internet I need to try it on Twitter soon. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:33:25
Although many tips might be refunded, he is taking a risk, and also using his time to do that. So great work right there.
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:25:33
Okay, but not everybody thinks 22°C is too cold ;-) Jump in now :-P

Sounds like scam attempt to me? Everyone in this thread be alarmed. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:01:40
I have been  tipping on reddit (edit: I meant Twitter) a little and there already exists a bot detecting tips and then replies begging. Have him blocked now. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:37:40
I agree with your main point. I am not so sure of all the arguments around it. I don't think the price reflects that bitcoin can and will work as a currency. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:57:34
Trolling at its best. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:48:09
What excactly do you mean? The official Secret Santa is here 
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:45:39
Yes, thanks for your answer. I forgot to mention, obviously I am using 2FA on all my bitcoin related accounts. 
I am not "scared" because I am holding more than I can afford. Also I have it distributed quite a lot. But I still don't want to be one of those guys who make some mistake which could be prevented.
Also there are different kinds of 2FA (yubikey, google authenticater etc...) which also not all seem to agree on their safety. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:16:16
No, to tell the truth I have no cold storage yet. I obviously have read some thing, and I think technically I should be able to do it but have no tried. And maybe I really should start with small amounts now. Just need to take the time at some point...
Thank you and have a coffee on me private
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:03:15
It is online now: 
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:08:48
But does it have to be activated in other subreddits? Or does work in any?

Yes, carry on.

Awesome. Congrats on your new job! Kind of jealous ;-) Will follow you on Twitter. Good luck on your and changetip journey. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:01:15
Maybe, maybe not. I am not telling you you should store large amounts there. You can easily transfer them between a "safe" wallet and changecoin.
And I also hope that bitcoin businesses learn from the past.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:53:41
Ok will tell you in 2 years if you were doing it right or wrong. Either in your private mansion or under the bridge.

@_date: 2014-05-27 13:57:42
@_date: 2014-07-31 11:58:44
Yeah I can also see the volatility point. It depends of course how your bills are defined. Whether in fiat or bitcoin, and whether the amount of bitcoin you have to pay is fixed in bitcoin or depends on the current price. And finally the more bitcoin you hold, the less problems with that will you have ;-) 
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:21:22
Yes, but such a service makes it easier for new people to come on board. Obviously then you can learn to set up a wallet yourself.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:54:04
Maybe I didn't see that one. Obviously Secret Santa is about thinking what would suit your match best, and I would always say that this goes first.
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:41:34
"Real" translation of that Paragraph, although the google one was already very good:
This is exactly what has taken place - and even in a highly sensitive plan. A PowerPoint presentation was secured at the house search where the private detective lives. It has the name of the agent together with the title "Bitcoin Feb2014". It was a concept of how the NDB could pay his foreign sources in future without leaving suspicious traces. The idea: An anonymous company in Switzerland should buy Bitcoins on behalf of the intelligence. The digital currency can then be converted abroad by a third party in cash. The advantages: "No couriers, no international bank transaction, solid contract and payment environment, camouflage and &lt;plausible deniability&gt;, (...), limited cost."
@_date: 2014-11-07 15:40:53
No sorry, you are right. I was mixing up things and not understanding everything correctly... Language barrier...
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:09:23
I will look into this. Don't know how it works yet. Thanks for the tip. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:23:12
Yes. Anywhere where a large number of small tips is given, this can have a huge impact. It can maybe remove ads, or encourage people to go on with their work.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:36:21
No no, I count the gox losses. (wasn't 100 though, was more..  100 $ was the price where I bought).

Hi there. Sorry I cannot help. But here is the link to the museum for anyone interested: 
I will recommend it to some friends.

So is it Coins or "goods" that are being bought?
Or just movement without anything happening?
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:54:54
Did you have to do anything to get this? I wonder whether I will also get this. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:38:04
So where can I buy cheap Popcoins?

Oh sorry I didn't see that. Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:54:49
The big thread where they are tipping everyone is incredible.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:39:12
I know coinmap, I meant bigger/more international firms. Usually it is like dentists and small Cafes, and even then no one really knows that they are accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:06:19
You could also just have kept the 5 Pound you found and have given him another one out of your pocket? What would they have done then?
Of course bitcoin was also very nice in the end!
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:12:06
Ok I realise my mistake. Sounds strange but I am no native speaker. ;-) 
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:58:39

@_date: 2014-05-01 16:58:37

@_date: 2014-02-16 00:18:43
Or just do it in like 1 Coin steps. And even take some profit. 
Wait a minute... 
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:01:02
That's awesome!
@_date: 2014-07-31 11:48:35
Yes. So maybe we should not only focus on businesses, where a private person can pay with bitcoin. Important would be that "intra-business" (sorry I don't know how this would be called in english) deals could be payed with bitcoin. But then there will be problems with laws again maybe? Also the businesses don't know how to put bitcoin in their yearly balances?
@_date: 2014-11-12 10:53:35
Are you a prophet or something? Because I am looking at the charts now and it seems much more appropriate now it gets close to 400.

Ah geil. Ha gar ned gwösst dases scho Schwizer Fermene get wo Bitcoin anäme.
Translation: Awesome, I didn't know there are Swiss business accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:35:51
I can see you are angry. Unfortunately this is what online journalism is all about at the moment. It is not only sites writing about bitcoin which are working like that.
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:36:42
It is not like mom's don't already get their money stolen from normal bank accounts. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:13:10
Yeah I think that would be possible. But then the different sites would need to cooperate with changetip. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 13:10:56
I see what you did there. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:29:23
I am in the process of translating it to english. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:24:39
Not evereyone just wanting to buy cheap coin and then sell again really wants to hold coin.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:35:33
It might go mainstream in the sense of the public knowing about it and more and more not thinking it is some stupid nerd money or ponzi scheme. Mainstream usage on the other hand might take a little longer.
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:33:31
I am surprised there is not more news/interest around here since Kraken is now part of the deal and payed quite a bit. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 09:39:36
Yeah roughly same time. Average cost: too high

A short translation here:
Finma ordered the ATM-operator Bitcoin Suiss to shut down the machines. Niklas Nikolajsen, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse is disappionted: "We thought everything was legally on solid ground. We will clarify further steps with our lawyers." The goal will be to reset the ATM as soon as possible.
Finma didn't want to comment on the case. Their spokesman Vinzenz Mathys explains that he is not allowed to do so on running actions. In general bitcoin would be a delicate field. Many problematic questions remain unsolved, for example concerning licensing. "The question is: Does it need a banking license or could there be any problems with money laundering?"
Currently it doesn't look too good for the Swiss Bitcoin-ATM-Project. If the Finma insists on the application of a banking license, at least months if not years would pass until the ATM could renew its service.
I am open to any suggestions concerning my translation.
@_date: 2014-12-04 09:28:07
This is actually bad news (for my productivity)

@_date: 2014-12-03 09:41:04
I would be so scared sending around that much money :-)
(I know that this is not rational)
@_date: 2017-02-23 05:58:51
It might be good for traders/speculators/holders, but not for bitcoin and what bitcoin really is. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:25:36
He was already. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 07:36:05
Thanks for the correct summary of my thread :-) 
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:33:03
Yes, no problem. And also your idea is absolutely useful. I guess the opinions just differ on whether it is still in the sense of the Secret Santa to find the best stuff for your match, and additionally give away some bitcoin, or whether that is not a good thing to do.
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:00:15
Nobody tells you not to also send what your secret santa wants. But not that they always write that. And I don't think if you take part in such a thing you are not open to surprises.
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:15:37
Thank you for being so nice!
I mean providing a direct wallet adress is useful too. But usability like with changetip is just a way of bringing it into mainstream. 
Thanks for the info with the changetip extension. Just installed it. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:32:19
Pretty sure in future there will be a service who prohibits users from sending Bitcoin to malware addresses. 
Not that everyone will ned such a thing, but it has to be a standard service for normal everyday users.
@_date: 2017-02-02 09:53:29
Well put. Mentioning the possibility should not be interpreted as saying it is the case. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:23:59
It feels like all of the important and great guys are making comments here. 
And I am just sitting here...
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:19:14
Some kind of volume weighted or time weighted average would definitely make more sense.
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:01:59
Thank you very much. Although I should tip you ;-) I will look for you in other discussions :-)
@_date: 2017-02-14 18:39:54
Former. Why? Also pretty sure he has a good stack himself. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:56:23
ok, with a US proxy it works. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 08:54:29
How unexpected. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:38:53
Sofortüberweisung sucks anyways. 
I was lucky with "Raiffeisenbank" until now. Although I guess they cannot really do anything on the direct user to user transaction done with bitcoin.de.
But I also had no problem putting money on Kraken and... wait for it... Gox. I am a lucky guy.
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:19:53
Obviously this is a huge problem. To solve that maybe they would need integration/cooperation directly with reddit. Such that just the tipping amount would appear next to the tipped comment. And no extra post would be needed.
But this problem is especially big on reddit. I don't think on twitter the same is true.
@_date: 2015-01-12 08:02:15
That is nice of you, but I guess you will not find someone. Many people don't even realize for some time that they have been hacked. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:13:14
He is unbanned now: 
Edit: Thanks for the gold, although it feels a little too much since I only linked to his tweet :-)
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:12:40
He is already unbanned now. You are late ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:01:41
Sure, but I don't think there will be a difference. The war against terrorism will not be won with currencies or changes therein.

I cannot make the time, you can distribute some tips from me. 
have $1 on me, andreasma! private
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:57:14
I think it is not so much needed now compared to the goxxing and the last crash. This now started slowly... everybody had plenty of time to cash out.
But still worth a post though.

Video not available for me. Seems to be down.
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:14:02
Let's just hope not too many people post these links on twitter/facebook and so on ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:15:22
Next time ask him whether he thinks fiat money has less problems with financing terrorists than bitcoin can possibly have.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:05:07
I don't think the guy has the possibility to develop such feelings. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:46:01

I mean, if you want to tip a specific person. If you just want to give money to the first person seeing it, then it is ok.
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:45:12
Building these booths in the countries where the workers earn their money would not be the problem. But where their families live, there would be a problem. They are pretty distributed and even less tech savvy.

I am in no way an expert, but this sounds great. Might proof very useful for future applications. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:54:00
Unfortunately, all you guys are saying is true. And this is not just funny, it is a huge problem in our society nowadays.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:40:51
You're doing it right
@_date: 2015-05-03 08:49:22
It is always good when people take a closer look at the so-called news. Thank you for doing that. $1 private

"Clearly stating BU would be an altcoin reduces the potential damage of a split. Some exchanges have already, more should do the same."
source: 
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:50:57
I actually don't tell anyone. Maybe if the topic comes up and they show interest. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 13:06:37
Cheers my friend with the same username-appendix :-) (I am also Swiss)
May I ask what you buy at overstock and don't get in Switzerland?
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:40:06
I just want to say thank you to all exchanges. They make it much easier for everyone who just wants to deal with BTC and nothing else. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 08:53:43
What's the status there? 
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:47:36
Username checks out. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:28:19
Although maybe not realistically, but you can say that with these 5 million Gox would have lived longer. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:53:14
You also need to add a counterfeit dollar bill ;-)
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:03:18
The comments here show the full range from optimism, realism, pessimism and negativism. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:17:38
They are already paying by weighing the money (no joke). 
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:03:25
It's banks. It is a funny mixture between actually having lots of problems and not much money and wasting a ton of money on projects and then being surprised that again millions went into a black hole. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:50:06
His Latte please.

Where can I get a good ELI5 or something similar on this situation? I don't get the exact reasons for the problems from the video. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:16:42
Only partially funny for me. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:29:37
I know this is a little bit off topic. But in general, is it also a bad idea to use blockchain.info wallets? Or their mobile app? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:48:59
8450? Is this an ATH for ants? 
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:10:44
Yeah, same here :-(
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:28:45
Great paper. 
I think your dashes (don't know what they are called in english, these things "—") are a little bit too long. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:39:31
The problem isn't even that the orders don't go through, it is that you don't know whether it did and suddenly you have two orders. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:31:24
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:49:31
You have learned so much already, that is valuable way more than money and will help you in the future. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 10:23:32
I get the same error, I also cannot see the button that says “Confirm the Results of Approval or Disapproval of the Claims”
@_date: 2016-02-26 11:09:29
Maybe only people with accepted claims have the button.
@_date: 2016-09-16 08:54:29
Yes, but he is also working on an updated version of "Mastering Bitcoin". I think the book "The internet of Money" was mainly "written /transcribed" from his talks by someone else.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:41:54
where can I get a good one in Europe?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:44:54
Yes I am afraid of calculating how much I gave away with changetip here and on twitter. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:04:16
I am afraid to retweet and spend 1000 $ ;-)
@_date: 2015-04-10 18:49:24
Maybe they had access through teamviewer for a longer time and clicked on the "do not ask again for 30 days" without you realising. I am not an expert and don't know whether that is actually possible. Just an idea.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:49:54
The "problem" for us normal users if he confesses is that we will never find out what really happened. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 11:00:27
Good to have him on board. But I guess only one mod is maybe not enough for ever?
@_date: 2015-09-16 12:24:42
You're fired.
@_date: 2015-09-01 12:23:23
I guess if you don't have a bank account? But maybe there are other points.
@_date: 2015-09-01 13:03:40
Yeah that should be possible.
@_date: 2015-09-08 20:45:23
If "opinions of one man are not especially important anyway" why is one man making the rules in this subreddit?
@_date: 2015-09-01 13:19:36
So much to gain from "some CPU-mined altcoin"?
@_date: 2015-09-09 09:46:28
I could also have claimed 1 billion. That does not say they are legitimate.
@_date: 2015-04-08 09:34:59
Yeah. Paging please check this comment thread to avoid future confusion concerning donations directly to you. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:12:06
I don' think this kind of stuff should come up in a thread about bitcoin:
Not only that i cannot feel very safe in germany due to millions of new instrusive citizen(refugees) whoa lot just never learned minimum behaviour rules to women and I am not allowed to have a teaser or a knife or whatever."
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:25:27
I can also eat only different cakes for dinner ;-)
But I am certainly saving this message!
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:33:57
Paging Also check out his comment made here:
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:01:40
This is not really new: 
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:20:41
This message was approved by his Majesty the President of Bitcoin. 
He does not own the bitcoins, but he makes them.
@_date: 2015-10-16 08:46:31
Came to reddit to post this. See it is already here. I could not understand people mocking them after 2 days. 
You can see the nice growth also here: 
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:49:30
Sure, but you only get the file for the 3D-Printer.
@_date: 2015-10-28 10:25:16
Paging Oh wait.
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:48:40
Ah, bitcoin related development going on here. I never hear of any like this, it just seems so quiet here concerning bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-27 13:18:59
You fucked my brain up pretty badly. But at least I think I now understand math.
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:02:25
I would even drop by if I wasn't lost. But I am not in Manila :-(
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:16:56
Great job on putting these together.
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:47:19
Thanks for background checking!
@_date: 2015-02-14 12:44:19
Wow, awesome work. I hope others value it as well, in the meantime heres $1 private 
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:04:22
More transactions although cheap does not mean more money? Also if bitcoin is dead because they deployed buggy software they won't make any money. Is this so difficult to understand? 
@_date: 2015-10-09 12:09:39
No you were not the only one. I thought I speak english, but often I do not think about these business names... Or I am just stupid :-)
@_date: 2015-03-30 10:45:35
Bear market. Gonna short this.
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:14:48
Awesome work!
Gruess ins Ländle. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:43:39
The good thing is bitcoin allows for a wide range of applications/services. So maybe in the future there will be a group of businesses with some kind of oversight, rules, and security where the user does not take all the risk. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 20:26:09
I will make the app and with an update I will secretly replace the burn address with one of myself.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:40:49
Right, cause in the metric system 18 comes after 16.
@_date: 2015-02-11 23:21:54
Ouch this is the first time I even read about testnet. So concerning your question about the average bitcoiner being stupid... Lets hope I am below average ;-)
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:27:16
Subconscious I was reading it as if he were joining the reddit cryptocurrency team. Took some time until I realised my mistake.
Still great of course.
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:54:00
Thanks for the "how to"! $1 private
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:34:51
No I did.
@_date: 2015-02-06 06:23:52
I think that already exists, check out  they have point raffle and Crypto raffle. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:55:04
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:09:11
Yeah JDownloader is great. Unfortunately at the moment I only have a chromebook so I can't use it... Maybe I need to buy another Laptop. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:36:22
Why not also make an altcoin with a fixed exchange rate for users of your exchange? I'm on board!
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:24:52
Yeah and Buttcoin comes in last.
@_date: 2016-07-05 11:41:04
Sorry for mobile link, but I am not sure if Desktop works. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:19:35
As a Swiss I can only say I hope they don't give in to political pressure from the US like Swiss banks recently... But I guess this is different. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:20:45
Here I read the same shit on and on... it is a bubbe... in the long term there will bi 10K or whatever per Coin. I think everybody knows that for now. Why not post more interesting stuff?
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:30:44
Yes. I am from Germany, this has been on the news some time ago. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:30:28
I hope you will give us an update here.
I was also thinking about using this app.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:53:15
oooh you did it. Ok gonna check it out now. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:06:01
This tipping goes way out of hand. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:57:58
Ah yes I get it... it only shows up on your "personal" frontpage, if you follow the subreddit. But if you dont it will not show up. 
This is bad because like that now one will see it. But it could get to the front page via ...
Because I would have thought that reddit users would be quite likely to use Bitcoin. But at the moment bitcoin still looks very much like a niche. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:03:33
Sorry I cannot help. This sounds terrible and should be solved. I give you an upvote and hope someone else can help you. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:50:13
Of course the article has draws wrong conclusions like this one: "However, the bitcoin exchange rate has suffered recently, after an incident that highlighted the potential dangers of the system." I would like to see proof for that statement. Additionally, there is no point mentioning that also you can steal money from a real bank, which does not seem to inhibit that fiat money more or less works...
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:01:45
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a bitcoin out of me
No girl, no friends, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' N E R D
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:58:22
I don't approve this either. The question is whether privacy is more important and whether the bank helps or does it unintentionally. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:05:33
I love when stories like yours happen on reddit. I wish the best for your business. And also success for getting more people into bitcoin! 
(sorry for my English, from Switzerland) :-)
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:14:20
Great, thanks! So we do not rely on strange interpretation from so-called "Journalists"
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:09:13
yeah same here... too lazy to learn how it works. Never got tipped to be forced to ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:46:56
Maybe the fact that it already did. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:13:18
Strange, just a moment ago it was available. Maybe they install the paywall when traffic to an article increases?
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:59:09
But this article is maybe only online and not printed.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:14:05
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:31:53
How do you guys read from my title that I believed the story? 
And from how famous the post was some of you guys may also have upvoted it...
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:52:44
You did a very good job here and put a lot of effort and creativity up! This is a great way to spread the word and get people into actually using bitcoin. 
And don't worry, I cannot take part in this "hunt" anyway, as I am from Europe :-)
But good luck to you, may the Coins flow smoothly!
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:35:01
I have not seen anybody mention Raiffeisenbank yet. So I just wanted to say my transaction to mt.gox worked alright back in September.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:36:27
have you tried all small?
lagaflprduscbufrgeuhsimüdiju or lgfpdsbvusmdj
and ü = u
or ü = ue
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:11:48
Ok that is a good point. But maybe at some point in future there will be an online wallet provider offering similar things to its customers for a small fee?
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:23:50
I can't find anything in english. The delict amount is 700000€ My english is not too good. But if there are any questions just ask. 
Edit: They hacked computers to use them to mine. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:45:22
First sentence says: "Es handelt sich um eine Währung, die weder Scheine noch Münzen kennt."
In english: "It is a currency which knows neither banknotes (better translation?) nor coins."
So what does the first picture of the article show...
Sorry it is just stupid in my opinion.
Bild is like the Sun in england... it reaches many, but articles like these are often not very good researched and very simplified.
edit: typos
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:20:24
It is on the frontpage finally:
