I think the fees and transaction problems have become way too troublesome for it to be ignored now. Bitcoin in its current state is unusable, and every day that Bitcoin continues to have issues the more its flaws are going to become apparent. Funny thing is when the price goes up as many probably want, the problems of Bitcoin become even more apparent as the fees and transaction times worsen even more.
There has to be some middle ground between short term and long term solutions. I'm glad to see some people realizing they can't just really on being a first mover.

People started getting annoyed with the political stance that Coinbase was taking when it came to Bitcoin.
So people have been moving to places like Gemini or Bitstamp from the look of things. Both cover withdrawal fees, which was one of the draws of GDAX for me. Also like that Gemini has up to $500 a day available immediately for ACH deposits, since with GDAX I've had to wait a week for any funds from ACH deposits to clear. And during those times there have been cases where coins like ETH just double in price costing me money. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:45:54
They matter even if you don't spend it, because it becomes a hassle to use to move it to another wallet or exchange to trade for other cryptos. Given how valuable a dollar of crypto here or there can be in the long run the flaws of Bitcoin come out every time someone tries to actually use it. And that just causes more people to move away from Bitcoin due the weakness of transactions that has become bigger over time. And people end up in a situation where they are spending more time trying to convince negatives are a positive.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:24:50
I think the reason it's being mentioned is because a lot of people might not be aware that GDAX isn't the only exchange that covers the cost of withdrawals. I hadn't been aware that Gemini and Bitstamp do.
Along with withdrawals, what has really provided incentive to try out Gemini was finding out that they immediately credit up to $500 for ACH deposits. Been a lot of times where I've waited more than a week to get access to my deposit, and seen prices for like ethereum just double up during the wait.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:13
You underestimate how easily people are influenced. Add in the fees and transaction times, and Bitcoin just gives Bitcoin Cash extra ammo.
Then add in what is to be gained by the downfall or at least the decreasing dominance of BTC, and it makes sense why people with pockets would push for BCH. Especially when adding in other business ventures like agreements with credit card companies and mining equipment.

BCH going in with the intent of killing off BTC is what put me off towards them. There's a reason I have bought other coins like Ethereum, and are fine with the idea of them eventually even overtaking BTC. And if the people most prominent behind BCH handled themselves better and just focused on making the best coin they could then I'd have been more open to adopting them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:49:30
I've used Bitcoin Cash to increase my Bitcoin holdings. However, if you aren't careful you can end up being stuck in Bitcoin cash if you don't exit fast enough and the BTC/BCH ratio suddenly dives. 
Having said that I did accumulate weeks before, but I'm not sure if I'd risk entering back in right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:03
Gemini. Trade fees are negligible something like 0.25%, and prices for GDAX seem like they are often higher anyways than other exchanges.
Also, the main reason I have been with coinbase is due to them covering withdrawals, but Gemini covers that too. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:05:16
I wonder what the percentage of transactions being sent out by exchanges are to segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:04
It's going to be longer than a week.
As long as fees and transaction times are an issue, Bitcoin Cash will never go away. Its existence is due to the current flaws of Bitcoin as opposed to some conspiracy.

Hearing more people doing stupid stuff like that is making me really hopeful for huge discounts once the market implodes. They'll be the first to panic sell due to putting in more than they can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:43:58
Until BTC gets its fee and transaction times in order BCH is going to be pretty reliable for trading to get more BTC.

Yes you can, but when Roger brings up his wealth he does it in a way that comes off as arrogant or is used to undermine someone for not being wealthy.
He is in need of a PR rep when it comes to how he handles himself. While loyal supporters may defend his comments it is a look that doesn't look good coming from anyone. And by anyone, I mean just going beyond the realm of crypto. It just comes off as very petty.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:29:50
BCH got added which is great, but opening of trading was unannounced and only a few were able to take advantage of selling BCH for thousands of dollars more than they were going for on other exchanges before trading was frozen. 
So people were angry about that, since those who were early or supposedly had prior knowledge of BCH trading launch time were the ones to take advantage during that windows.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:42:38
I wonder how much it is to open up a channel, and whether it can be kept open indefinitely to just be able to transact in the future with that so it ends up being a one time fee.

haha. I find it kind of amusing Bang Bang theory got people who never had interest in the show to watch it simply because of it having a Bitcoin themed episode.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:32:28
People had issues with the timing of the trading platform going live since only those who had prior knowledge of the opening time or were lucky enough to be present were the ones able to take advantage before trading froze. Whether the unannounced launch of trading was manipulative practice is subjective.
Either way, this comment was specifically regarding insider trading beyond the scope of just crypto, and whether it should be accepted practice. And less about whether the situation was insider trading. 
Whether it be crypto or stocks, insider trading is one that benefits those who are most well connected, and individuals who tend to be in a position to benefit the most are probably ones in the upper tiers of society than average people. And insider trading always goes for bad news too, so insiders can unload holdings before things crash. For instance, those with knowledge that Segwit2x was to be canceled, or knowledge of liquidity issues. Anyways, insider trading being good or bad is a matter of personal opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:57:35
Despite being uncensored compared to their attitude turned me off from them. Had they just focused on offering the best crypto as opposed to wanting to kill off BTC then I'd have been way more receptive to having them as part of my long term holds.
I am also a fan of block size increases, since I think short term solutions are as important as long term solutions. Had they been less aggressive I'd probably be a BCH supporter, but I've got other coins to turn to.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:47
Logging on to GDAX and seeing that price broke my brain for a while until I tried to take advantage after seeing the price it was going for on other exchanges.
Orders weren't filling though, and that made me sad.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:22:54
The fact that Bitcoin is at a state where we even have to worry about how someone uses Bitcoin isn't good.
And with most of the crypto market being in BTC, and each trade conversion being a taxable event that makes changing it multiple times not convenient. Not to mention, telling people to use something like LTC is further evidence of how big the issues of fees and transaction times have become when alt coins are being pushed.
And the reality is that Bitcoin Cash does have Bitcoin in its name. It doesn't matter whether it would or wouldn't be above Litecoin. The reality is that it is, and it is a threat. And will continue to be a threat that gets bigger and bigger the longer the issues of transactions times and fees aren't addressed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:10:04
No, but I can't help but associate one of their most prominent figures with it either. And I'm free to form opinions of my own.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:07:39
Ledger Wallet has support for other coins. For coins that don't have hardware wallet support you can just go to the official website of the alt coin purchased, and then proceed to download and install the software wallet after verifying the checksum. Then just send coins to that. 
If you want to be extra paranoid you can generate the wallet on a computer that is kept offline. A rasberry pi is a cheap device that can be used for this purpose.
I don't keep what I don't want to lose on exchanges. I don't trust them, and I don't trust their ability to compensate for lost cryptos. Especially the exchanges that don't even deal with fiat deposits.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:19
So people were actually able to profit off this? Damn I wish I had been quicker about putting in my sells before it got frozen.

Bitcoin Cash has had to have turned into one of the best advertising campaigns for Gemini. I had heard of them before, but probably wouldn't have gotten around to registering with them if it hadn't been for how coinbase handled the BCH launch.

It's a bubble. It will crash. It always crashes. It is not an investment. 
Having said that. Doesn't hurt to cut back on spending in other areas of your life, and throw some money in the event it isn't a bubble. After all, we don't hesitate to spend money on things that we absolutely know won't return any value on a daily basis.
Just don't be crazy and take out loans or drain your savings. That is stupid. Just assume whatever money you throw at any crypto has already been lost to the wind.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:01
Well Bitcoin going down I can understand with the rise of Bitcoin cash making people scared, and the fees, transaction times, and memory pool becoming a glaring issue. 
But, then all the alts are going down too, so what's going on with that? Are people cashing those out to BTC, ETH, LTC, and then trying to send those off to an exchange to quickly liquidate?
XRP has risen, so maybe people moved towards that due to some losing trust in decentralized crypto and feel safer with ones that have more bank usage?

Also, the reason to implement segwit is so that if the network continues to be congested then it is much more likely that big block supporters will get their way or at least have more ammunition towards the issues of small blocks, since there will be definitive proof.
So why not give it a try?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:13:56
I think what will cause the next big crash that could lead to a multi year bear market will be the hacks of major exchanges. The Mt Gox collapse was huge, and that was with the general population still not having gotten into crypto. The average person waking up to find everything missing is going to be a shock, and lead to a lot of distrust.
I guess that is how the government could take down crypto if they really wanted to. There's probably going to need to be some big regulatory changes that holds exchanges a 100% liable for crypto they hold for customers, and require even bigger access to liquidity than there is now. At least for centralized exchanges. At that point banks may be the only ones with the capital to be able to adhere to those requirements.

Is the coinbase insider trading really that big of a deal? I was pissed myself, since I wanted to be able to be there right when it opened to trade with my BCH that coinbase was finally releasing.
Am I underestimating the situation being mostly about people just being upset at the timing?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:40:45
It's not real surprising. Coinbase is going to list a lot more cryptos, and their employees are probably buying up a whole bunch of those alts right now due to whatever is on coinbase exploding in price.

Do they precredit for ACH deposits too or only wire transfers? And how long does it take to show up?

It isn't that buying coffee with Bitcoin is important. It is that Bitcoin would be unstoppable for decades to come if it can also achieve the ability to multiple transactions without worrying about loss due to fees or transactions speeds being susceptible to traffic and miners. Why push people to use other crypto's for daily transactions when Bitcoin can do it all, and make all the other crypto's irrelevant unless they really bring something special to the table.
Why else do you think lightning network is something BTC is hoping is a solution, and BCH is hoping is vaporware or at least another 18 months away? 
You now what happens tends to happen in other markets when companies just get complacent on past successes and their brand? They lose market share.

Adding BCH wasn't the issue. I thought it was good, and a no brainer with BCH being in the top 3 in market cap.
What bothered me is that they just launched the trading platform for BCH out of the blue, so only employees or those who were lucky enough to be on GDAX when it went live were able to sell BCH for thousands of dollars more than it was going for on other exchanges. So those people were able to sell for $5000-$9000 at a time when it was trading for $3000. Then they froze trading.
They should have first allowed withdrawals of BCH, and then set a date and time for when BCH trading would go live so everyone would have had an equal opportunity to trade when it opened.

Oh dear, do you not realize that since then there are thousands of crypto coins out there, and that one of the main criticisms of Bitcoin right now is slow transactions times and fees? 
Bitcoin is working on it, but it may be months or a year or longer before the issue is addressed. And things move so fast in the cryptospace there is no telling what can suddenly happen. Even if fees and transactions times weren't an issue the crypto space is just so unpredictable.
If you still insist on being reckless with your savings then at least pick up some of the top 10 coins also. But, please don't be reckless with your money, and don't enter in thinking this some fool proof get rich quick scheme. Reason people can see huge gains is because they can just as quickly lose it all.

Thank you for acknowledging my power. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:57:27
Yep, if Bitcoin fees and transaction times were low then there wouldn't be any reason to use any other coin right now, and arguments like it being a store of value wouldn't even be necessary to make.
If Bitcoin wants to be in a position where they have to keep defending itself then it is as simple as addressing the issue of fees. Until then more power will keep being given away to other cryptos, which I guess some people are fine with seeing happen.

Also I think the sub needs a sticky on guides on how to read mempools and set up fees.
A stick for tech discussions regarding things like the progress of lightning network would be good too.
Too much of the sub right now is just mostly price.

I'm in the same camp with you. Only thing I've used Bitcoin Cash for has been to trade for more Bitcoin.
But, I still would prefer that more of the sub start acknowledging that fees are a big problem. It's something people entering into crypto for the first time are going to be caught off guard by, and not in a positive way. Not to mention, people new to crypto don't have the animosity towards BCH that others who've been around longer have.
It's helpful to see things from other people's perspective as opposed to just inside the community.

Lot of previous holders have probably been cashing out from legacy wallets. 
As I understand, legacy to segwit addresses aren't considered segwit transactions. But, if at least a growing percentage of Bitcoins from exchanges are being sent to Segwit addresses then it would be a small step forward. I wonder what percentage of transactions from exchanges are being sent to segwit wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:24:17
I'm rather shocked at how many people have left their crypto on exchanges.
At least coinbase has finally gotten some of those people to move their funds to wallets even if it is simply due to being pissed off.
But, really people shouldn't be leaving it on exchanges even if they like them.

Bitcoin has nobody to blame but themselves for how much BCH has grown, since arguments about how BTC is a storage of value or to use LTC or ETH is one that wouldn't even need to be made if fees and transaction times weren't present.
Until those a dealt with BCH is going to continue to stay around. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:23
I'm not a bitcoin cash fan. Quite the contrary. I want Bitcoin to be the dominant crypto, but ignoring its flaws isn't the way to approach things.
The fact that Bitcoin is now at a point where people are telling people to use ETH or LTC if they worry about fees shows how much Bitcoin's usability has decreased.
There is nothing wrong with pointing out the flaws. New adopters of crypto are going to be the ones to start really increasing the adoption of crypto, and people need to be aware that they aren't going to be as forgiving as loyalists.
Putting our fingers in our ears isn't the way to go. Neither is lashing out at people because they aren't taking on the stance of a fanatic supporter.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:42:41
The term legality gets thrown around a lot. Which is completely valid when it comes to defining whether criminal prosecution is warranted or not. 
But, something being legal isn't an endorsement of it being moral. It does tend to be used though by some who try to justify their behavior.
I myself would definitely take advantage of insider trading no questions asked. But, I'm not going to pitch it as being beneficial for society. It'd be simply for greed even if I knew a product I'd be dumping on someone would never recover in price.
So that brings the question of should there be regulatory practices for corporate run entities and their employees, since it is usually in the best interest of individuals and companies to maximize their profits even if it means predatory or misleading practices. And Is there enough faith that the market will act in the interest of society. 
Now those things becomes less of an issue if there were decentralized exchanges or the implementation of atomic swaps. But, right now most of the influence and control is in the hands of centralized exchanges who determine what and when something is to be added. They are the gatekeepers, and traders have no choice but to put trust in third parties who could suddenly be "hacked" or disappear. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:06:54
One thing I've liked about some of the alt coins is that they've done a pretty job of communicating the progress of their projects in a way that is easy to understand.
I think the biggest cause of FUD right now is people feeling like they are in the dark. Weekly updates on tests that have been done, code progression, and time frames would help people get a sense of progression.

The ironic thing is that the people to benefit the most from insider trading are the wealthy elite as opposed to the poor people Roger claims to be fighting for.

Absolutely. Right now when someone new to Bitcoin comes to they just see memes, hodl, and price discussions.

I'm very angry. It would have been okay if they didn't announce the opening of BCH out of the blue, so that only their employees would be able to take advantage of it. 
If anything, they should have given a set date and time for when the exchange would go live.
This today is a terrible way to handle the opening of new trading pairs. And people couldn't even trade before they froze it, so only people who got in early benefited.

Absolutely it does. The first question I posted here was how to set fees, and even when they are low it can take days to go through. Of course, it's been unusually congested with these forks.
Hope there is a solution that is months away as opposed to over a year away. At least something to provide some breathing room as the developers work on a long-term scaling solution.
Will be interesting to see how much Segwit can improve things in the mean time as hopefully more exchanges start implementing it.
And, I too hope it's not something keeps brushing as bitcoin just being a storage of value and high fees being fine. Being in support while still having open criticism is fantastic, and is something I've liked about with their skepticism Sunday threads. Recognition of possible shortcomings and solutions by the community helps improve trust as opposed to decreasing it.  Would actually love to see something like that on @_date: 2017-11-21 18:54:22

Yea, one of my first times posting here was to figure out how to set the fees, since Ledger Wallet was setting them real high.
Fees are going to continue to be a problem for a while, so some links to sites like  and how to interpret the graphs would be helpful for people sending bitcoin around for the first time.

Even if Bitcoin goes to $0 one of the most valuable things it has done for me is getting me to focus on ways I can invest as opposed to simply focusing on wages provided by an occupation.

It's why I'm rather bullish on Monero. Seems like a good holding right now for those that want some coins that aren't as tied to the schism that will go on for a while with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Their focus on privacy being default for all users is something I like too.

I would like to see a 2mb block, but I was against segwit2x because I didn't like the idea of a contentious fork splitting up the community and bringing upon uncertainty.
I hope this moment can eventually lead to some compromise  being made.

I believe in you!!! I got my limit orders ready!

Seems weird, but the ledger nano has been showing slightly higher fees for the Segwit Wallet over the Legacy.

It is very childish indeed, and when people new to the crypto space look at what's going on it leaves a bad impression. A more professional and mature approach is beneficial in the long run as opposed to resorting name calling.

Seems like this is what I've been looking for. Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:38:23
Thank you will do. Starting to make sense now.

I've used  to recover partitions in the past after accidentally reformatting my HDD.

Coins in the legacy and segwit wallets are separate for each other, but can do transactions between each other so it doesn't really matter.
Segwit is supposed to be cheaper, but the last couple of weeks has been crazy with the forks. I was surprised by how the fees for even the lowest transaction suggested by the ledger was over a couple of dollars now when it was in cents a month ago. Was curious and checked the legacy chain, and the fees suggested by ledger were slightly lower. 
I'm curious as to why that is.

Yep, I've started using Ethereum to do trades on other exchanges, since the fees are lowers and confirmations are faster. But, I'd much rather be able to do it with Bitcoin, and it'd be better for Bitcoin too. Convincing people that something that is seen as a problem isn't one doesn't seem like a good approach.

I use the ledger nano.

Yea, it's what I had used before, but the fees the last couple of weeks have just shot up. It's why I've been looking at the custom fees for when I don't need the bitcoins to arrive within a hour.
