I don't agree with this point. PayPal embraces bitcoin because people are leaving PayPal, and they are afraid to lose the business. There are hundreds if not thousands of eshops that sell digital goods, so why don't PayPal enables some kind of merchant system like others do? They are just lazy, don't blame the banks.

Paranoia: mental condition characterized by delusions of persecution, unwarranted jealousy, or exaggerated self-importance, typically elaborated into an organized system.
It's not paranoia when your government freezes your bank savings during a weekend in December 2001 and there is no way to get your money from your bank account. There are still countless of people suing the government, not including those who passed away during and after the government theft without their money.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:35:50
Do I really need to do your homework? Eg. You buy at 100,price goes down to 50. You sell and price goes to 40,you buy= you gained 10$ is you to this 5 times you are at break even, PLUS you have more bitcoin for when the price rises to 100 again.
Do your homework instead of what you are doing.

I've been trading in Buenos Aires for the past two years and one thing is for sure, **bitcoin revolution in Argentina never happened**.
Most of BTC sellers just sell fractions of BTC on sites such as localbitcoins, mercadolibre, OLX or others similar to eBay. The problem shows up for larger transactions where US Dollars are required, and they are really scarce.

First off if you want to buy a car with dollars that is now illegal in Argentina, you will have to buy it with pesos (at least the contract must be in pesos). 
Taking into consideration the price of black market dollar and the lack massive of bitcoin adoption due to the education level, I recommend you start looking right now for a seller and/or buyer right now. You will save time if you buy and sell in pesos, so in your case I would look for a trader in order to secure your future bitcoins when you return and need to change your pesos. 
Feel free to contact me if you need any kind of help when you come to Argentina or if you need liquidity and localbitcoins can't provide you enough coins. 
Safe trip!

I've never seen bitcoin world in such a good shape and with a great future ahead. The price is going down yes, but look at all those big companies investing in btc technology and developing new apps and services. We should be proud of our achievements as a group, think about the whole not just about your speculations going to the toilet. If you bought btc to sell and make profit, you should wait to see results, if you don't want to wait, sell right now at a loss and buy when it goes even cheaper to make a bigger margin profit. Or sell and we will buy them from you. 
Keep calm, keep focus, look at the big picture and the accomplishments we have achieved.

Well, that is not really a problem. Next to the bitcoin logo they could show an URL/QR code that links to a site with information for bitcoin n00bs.

In Argentina where I used to reside, the costs is over 60% of what you send.
SENDING: If you send 100 USD the receiver gets around 40 USD.
RECEIVING: If someone living in United States sends 100 USD to Argentina, they receive 340 ARS (Argentinian Peso).
* Forbidden official exchange rate (what you get at bloomberg tv, google finance, etc. Only for goverment employees and very few third parties): 1 USD = 8.59 ARS
* Black Market exchange rate (99,99% of population): 1 USD = 15 ARS

If you use PayPal, you are giving PayPal up to 10% of your purchased bitcoins via fees. 
Are you in the United States or elsewhere? Coinbase is not a scam, but their fraud system is very buggy and thus all those complaints,if you are fully verified with them, that's the beat way to buy bitcoins, if not I would suggest circle. 
If you live outside the US, go with bitstamp, whenever I sell bitcoins through them, the wired money it's on my bank account the following day most of the times, thanks to SEPA (Single European Payment System),something similar to SWIFT.

I spend most of the year in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Even if I go to another country we have atm restrictions and you can only extract 800usd each month only IF they give you permission prior to your travel.

It may be gone from now, but remember that PayPal has been filling bitcoin related patents during the last year. They want in, they are too obtuse just to know how. They have are leaders in their niche so it's hard for them.

Since day one we know bitcoin is traceable. The thing is, no address can be linked to a person if they don't provide identification.

At first you may think they offer a better price, but if you want to cash your bitcoins (or just buy some) they hold your assets for 4working days. If the price goes up or down heavy, you lose and can't revert the order. This doesn't happen on the rest of the exchanges outside the US. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:17:57
For a credit card you need a bank account, that can be free but the costs associated to a credit card are not cheap. On the other hand a bitcoin wallet is free and will be free for ever. 
So can banks beat that?

I'm not worried either. Butterfly Labs scammed a lot of people and shutting it down is a healthy move for the bitcoin industry and for everyone of us.

Bitstamp.net never let me down! Same day transfers and never a cancelled order or 1week without funds or bitcoins. 
My 2 cents

Electronic money is not fiat. Anyway if there is insurance for plastic money, there's no holdback for btc or apple pay insurance. They are all bits! 
@_date: 2015-03-05 23:29:13
Credit cards and payment processors like PayPal make it impossible to buy btc. You can skip those by direct buying from uncle Sam. Lol

You probably filled a bogus claim, PayPal terms are pretty clear and protect the buyer in all cases.

From bitstamp faq, I hope this helps:
Not regarding to withdrawal method, a fee will be displayed before executing the withdrawal and deducted from amount. SEPA withdrawals are charged with fixed 0.90€ fee once your funds are converted to EUR. Minimum amount for SEPA withdrawal is $10.00. International withdrawals are charged with 0.09% fee, minimum fee is $15.00. Minimum amount for international withdrawal is $50.00.

Unfortunately, instant buy was never available for me. And I've been a verified customer for almost two years with many purchases. By the way, my credit is flawless.

This is now common in most European countries. But it began in south America more than a decade ago. You wonder what's going on when most laws get "beta tested" in banana republics and then are polished and introduced into more "serious" countries.

Hello Agent, 
I agree with you, it would be better for the bitcoin community and it would help to engage more people into it. 
I believe we should also develop easy tools for computer non literate people so they can enjoy the btc experience without being a computer wizard. This would tear down a huge wall that prevents many from jumping on board. 
Thanks for your message and have a nice day 
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:49:37
Not in my case. I had to send them my id and proof of residence, same as coinbase! 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:30:52

Hello there

Actually for anyone with a bank account in Europe. Most accounts in UK are free for life (I'm not from the uk). 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:03:57
Beware! That's just the first step, if you want to cash on coinbase you waste almost a week waiting for the funds to show up. Meanwhile you can't use your own money nor your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:58:49
I'll register greyscale.co

Sometimes you can avoid SEPA if your account is within the same bank of the recipient. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 03:53:30
I know, but you can open one for free in Europe, plus no monthly charges! 
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:25:20
Mmmm I was thinking about the last movie. Sorry for the confusion lol
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:02:51
WOW, just WOW. Thank you coinbase!
What it doesn't say is if the bitcoin purchase/sell still going to take 4 working days. Anybody knows?
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:47:00
Actually if you use coinbase it's a disadvantage because they take your money and give you bitcoins around a week later. On kraken and bitstamp you can buy on the same day or up to 48hs by SEPA regulations. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:05:28
Nice upgrade then! You should add this information to the press release, since most of us used to bitch about that waiting time :) 
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:16:27
I would like the option to instant buy, as I am mostly allowed on European exchanges with SEPA. Or being able to add funds to coinbase and later instantly buy coins from that balance. 
Those long waiting times enforced by federal regulations are not really helping bitcoin. I understand that they have to follow the rules, but bitcoin was embraced because it would enable us to break free from absurd funneled regulations. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:09:43

Hey there, I've been living in Argentina for quite a few years. 
Uber is not illegal in Argentina, for something to be illegal it has to be typified as illegal in some law. 
They may be shady on taxes, but mainly because there are no tax laws for dotcoms in Argentina either. 
An article in law number 26.994 of the Federal Civil and Commercial Code says that one person may charge another for transportation services, and uber is using this as a shield. 
On the other hand Uber only launched in Buenos Aires city, which has a state owned taxi license system, new licenses have not been issued to demanding future cab drivers, and there is a black market for taxi licenses, the state denies this. Cab/Taxis in Buenos Aires are very expensive, an many of them are old, no seat belts, 9 out of 10 won't take debit/credit cards, and driven by careless drivers; during weekends and high demand events, they charge you with whatever fee they want and there is nothing people can do about it. 
There are only 38.000 cabs for 14 million people that use the city every day.  Subway is very basic and covers just 20% of the city.
