I have a question:
Which is the best feed to follow for tracking Bitcoin price?
I use QuadridgaCX for Canadian price, and BitfinexBTC for USA price.
Is there a better choice?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:38:16
Canada is at $5,384.55 (CAN$) right now...
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:03:37
OK, I'm confused...
If empty blocks are being mined on purpose - what would be the point of that? 
Does it give you some sort of advantage?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:08
Bitfinex right now:  $10337

No need to fly drones or look for snow.
Just get a FLIR and look for the heat signature.

...and now back to $4557 US$ @ 2:47 AM PDT  $6000.11 Can$

Come to Canada - It's $6,500 right now!
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:15:35
...and now back to $7,000
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:37:50
Ha!  I'm up about $25 in the last few hours!
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:13:25
Wow! Just briefly broke $7000 Canadian$  ($7,012)
Now back to $6950.39

Easiest way I know is to open an nTrust account.
Transfer cash from your bank to nTrust, then buy Bitcoin.
The great thing with nTrust is that they don't have any minimums - so you can play around with small amounts until you are comfortable. My first purchase of Bitcoin was only $1.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:09:21
Make that $28 since 9 PM last night...
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:01:48
Well, crap!
This really screws up my plans...
I've put a bit of "savings" into Bitcoin ($214.33 Can$) in order to save up for a new computer. Last time I checked, I was down to about $185 or so.
If this was just an investment, I'd be willing to ride this out as I feel it will rebound and go up in time. My problem is that I had planned on picking up my new motherboard this week. I really don't want to cash out and lock in a loss.
So, do I take the loss, buy the motherboard, and start buying more Bitcoin at the end of the month? Or do I wait and HODL and see what happens?
Only other concern is the motherboard has a $10 MIR that ends on July 31st. So that would help a bit.
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:25:28
Yes - exactly!
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:34:56
Just curious - as you've been involved with Bitcoin longer than I have...
Which sites do you use to track Bitcoin value?
I just recently found BitcoinWisdom, which can be used to track several different exchanges, all of which disagree with each other as to price or trend direction.
Also, I in Canada, so I'm working in Canadian dollars.
Just today I found  which looks interesting.
I've been doing my buying through my virtual bank: nTrust - a really great local company here in Vancouver, but I suspect that I'm paying a bit of a premium for ease of use.

I've been letting bitcoinwisdom run with alarms set for high and low.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:45:49
Wow, $4 !
I'm kind of new to this. I bought my first Bitcoin about 3 weeks ago on the rise, held through the dip, and now back into profit of about 14%
I spent $114.33 Can$ - Could cash out now for about $131.75
Not a huge amount one way or the other. May throw in another $100 next week depending how things look at the time.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:09:11
LOL !
I thought you might have figured that out when I said I'm saving for a motherboard and DDR4 RAM...
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:58:53
I think you are over-thinking this.
Just don't put yourself in the position of being a tax evader. The IRS kinda frowns on that - ask Al Capone.
As I told another person yesterday, your big concern is not taxes, (unless you don't pay them), your big concern is Civil Forfeiture.
Should that happen, you would be required to prove your innocence - and even that may not get your money back. Not to mention the pile of money you will spend to prove it.

Good advice to be sure.
I'm on a disability pension and get paid once per month. First thing I do is pay all my monthly bills like rent, cable, internet, phone, etc. Then put money aside for laundry, and distribute the remainder to credit card, virtual bank account.
I need to replace my computer and need about $600 for a new motherboard and DDR4 RAM.
I've bought some gift cards to a local computer shop, and when the opportunity came to buy some Bitcoin, I figured this would be a good place to hold some of that cash until I'm ready to buy.
Can I afford to lose it? Well, yes... and no. It wouldn't change my life one way or the other, just make it take a little longer to save up for my computer replacement.
Right now, I can afford to put aside $100 to $150 per month, depending what other needs come up each month.

Since my last post, I am now up $6.68 Can$
Yee ha!

I'm no expert on this, but they did manage to confiscate all of Silk Road's Bitcoins - Millions of dollars worth!
Most likely, they would grab bank accounts and cash after you convert... if it did happen.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:34:50
I'm sitting here watching...
Trying to decide if I should sell and take my profit and hope I can buy back in after a dip.
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:54:34
" If you can show it came from legal means and is being used for legal means then you can get it back after a hearing."
I think you may have an un-healthy trust in your government.
The big problem with Civil Forfeiture is that you must prove your innocence - they do not have to prove your guilt.
ie: You just got cash for $50,000 worth of Bitcoins. You are driving to your bank to deposit it when you get pulled over by the local police. They find the $50K cash. They "claim" that you must be a drug dealer, because why else would you have that much cash on you? They confiscate the cash. You now have to prove you got the cash legally. Judge may or may not believe you. Police split the cash with the federal government (Finders' Fee). You are SOL.
Or someone at the bank notices that you are suddenly making large deposits and reports you. They seize your bank account and again you have to prove you got the cash legally.
Best to get yourself a good lawyer who knows this field and pay him to help navigate your way to profit.

You are not worried about $3K signalling a sell off and dropping the value?
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:27:21
Just checked - I'm up $5.00 Can$ over my $114.33 "investment" of two weeks ago.
Not bad considering I was down about $20 last week!
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:44:52
I think that your first step is to find and hire a good lawyer who knows financial law.
The main reason is that the IRS can not make him testify against you - that does not apply to a tax consultant/financial planner.
Then get your lawyer to hire the financial planner.
I agree that taxes are not your problem - the risk of civil forfeiture is what you need to worry about. CF is the real bitch. They will take your money and make you prove that it was earned legally. They don't need to charge you with any crime, never mind convict you.
If you really have as much as you say, then you need expert advice. Cash out enough to pay for it - it will more than pay for itself.
Good luck, and keep us informed.
