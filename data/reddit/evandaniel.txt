In fact, it might be a good thing to see it go up: that could simply mean transactions are getting larger because batching is being used. It's entirely possible that the fee to send a given transaction goes down while the mean transaction fee goes up, as batching gets rolled out.

It's easy to argue those aren't bitcoins. Part of the Bitcoin protocol is the chain resolution protocol; the chain with the most proof of work behind it wins. The protocol is very clear about how you an someone else resolve a disagreement over which version of the chain is correct, and the one on your home PC will lose.

That's still optimistic: long term, outputs become inputs. Your estimates should balance accordingly, so a typical 2-output transaction should be assumed to have 2 inputs (on average).

We're also experiencing a lot of pools that think 731 kB blocks are a good idea... Something closer to 5 is probably a better guess for what the current network actually supports at a protocol level, and 3 is closer to what the miners are supporting.

The other barrier to entry PayPal has is that a PayPal competitor would have to convince both a large number of consumers and a large number of retailers. (Or just a large number of consumers for personal money transfer, but mostly it's about retail transactions, imho.)
With BTC, consumers can choose the exchange they like, and merchants can choose the exchange they like, and it doesn't matter whether we choose the same ones or not. That makes it much easier for a new exchange to get started, because they only (heh) have to solve the regulatory problem, no also a marketing one.
Basically, there's no such thing as a small-scale PayPal competitor.

"Risk" is not a binary term. What risk is acceptable to what reward? I think it's obviously acceptable to take a 1E-12 risk to bitcoin's security for a reward of a few dollars.

It's not front running. That's a very specific term. It refers to when an exchange or broker (or OTC desk, or whoever) looks at the orders coming in from their clients and places their own orders ahead of their clients' orders. It does not refer to trading on news that is not yet public.
Trading on news that is not yet public might be insider trading, if the person doing so is somehow in a privileged position with respect to that information. Or it might just be perfectly legal.

Right now bitcoin supply is worth about $8B. If people tried to move another $8B into BTC, the price would go up by a lot more than double.
The same will be true at large scales. The world in which BTC takes over is one with a highly unequal wealth distribution, and a money supply that is larger compared to the amount of physical wealth than the current money supply. It'll be weird. $3M (in 2014 dollars) per coin might well be low, if the current big holders just keep holding.

Something like that.
Coordination is not entirely trivial. Specifically, what is needed is not just the ability to communicate, but to make believable precommitments. Statements of the form "I promise to move my miners if at least X GH/s worth of other miners make the same commitment". The important part is not the ability to make that statement, but to make it believably.
Secondly, it must be *easy* to make that statement believably. If the cost of making that statement is high, there's a financial incentive to not bother.
For a good reference on non-zero-sum games, precommitments, and the strategy of coordination, see "The Strategy of Conflict". It's an excellent and approachable book.

In the extreme "holy shit it worked" case... Yeah, that sounds about right. Maybe a little high, maybe a little low.
M1 monetary supply for the world is in that range. The extreme wealth redistribution from a successful bitcoin takeover might mean the money supply is higher compared to GDP than it is now, if some of the big stakeholders keep holding rather than cashing out by buying physical goods / stocks / real estate. It might also be higher if more people hold their coins as opposed to storing them in fractional-reserve savings accounts (making bitcoin more comparable to present-day M2 supply rather than M1), but that seems a bit unlikely to happen on a large scale.

The comparison to credit card companies is not accurate.
A merchant only needs one bitcoin processor. If they like the competitor's fees better, they can switch. Credit cards don't work that way. If a merchant doesn't like Discover's fees, and choose not to accept them, then their customers can't use their Discover cards. The merchant can't just switch processors without impacting their customers.

At the moment, because of implementation costs.
Right now, implementing bitcoin makes sense if:
* You believe Bitcoin will eventually get big, so you might as well do it now.
* Your customers have a relatively high percentage of Bitcoin users already.
* Your credit card fees are unusually high, or otherwise unusually awkward (see gray markets, black markets, very small value transactions, sex / porn, and the like)
If you aren't a bitcoiner, don't see any particular reason to believe it is the way of the future, are a relatively small business, and are paying relatively ordinary transaction fees now, then your sales volume in Bitcoin might be small enough that it would take a very long time to recoup implementation costs.
And yes, I'm aware it's cheap and easy to implement. And I think it's awesome, and will grow in popularity a lot. That's why I'm here. But not everyone shares that viewpoint yet.

Why is their physical appearance relevant here on If they were average-looking men, or highly attractive men, or ordinary-looking women in more conservative clothing, would people be commenting on it as much?
I'm certainly not denying that it's an effective approach to marketing. That's not the problem.
The problem is the behavior of commenters here. Imagine the extension of this behavior to an in-person meetup. I think the analogous behavior is commenting on women showing up, assuming that they are relevant only because they look good and not because they care about bitcoins, and generally assuming they're there for you, and not because they are independent people. Hopefully you can see what that is less than desirable.

They'll survive just fine; it might suck a bit though. Any group with a steady income stream will keep that income stream, and it will inflate too. Unless they try to hold on to unprofitable pricing, the worst that happens is their savings devalue. If they hold dollar-denominated debts, those will get easier to service.
The at-risk group is one that doesn't switch early, holds dollars as net assets (not counting stocks, real estate, or other things that will rise in price during inflation), and has a small or zero income stream. In other words: retirees.

Not to mention Bitcoin doesn't solve it in the mathematical sense. It just gives a practical implementation that is good enough most of the time, and has nice properties for how confident you can be in the result.
"Solving" BG using bitcoin, in the sense implied by the original problem statement, means waiting for infinite confirmations.

Your argument only works if all the miners act in concert.
The 15% price drop is not directly comparable to the 0.16% profit.
If a single small miner moves, and no one else does, the price goes down 15% and they lose 0.16%. If they don't move, the price goes down 15%.
If a sufficient number of other people move, and the single small miner moves with them, they lose 0.16% (actually slightly less...) and the price doesn't drop. If a sufficient number of people move, and our single small miner doesn't, they don't lose anything.
Regardless of what everyone else does, our small miner would rather not move than move, even though they realize it would be better if everyone else moved, and would be willing to commit to moving on condition that other people did too.
This is normal, rational behavior, explainable by uncomplicated game theory.

So, it's all a lot more complicated than this, but in super-condensed form. The following is loaded with caveats and exceptions that aren't all spelled out.
People spending money on stuff results in more wealth. Holding your money and intending to spend it later is not as good, overall, as buying a durable good and holding onto it, intending to have it maintain some value for later and also generate value for you now. By "wealth" and "good" and such, I basically mean the total economic activity of stuff being dug up out of the ground and turned into things people want: more stuff in the world that people want = more wealth. Wealth != currency.
Deflation encourages holding onto currency. Inflation encourages spending currency. Inflation can be viewed as a "tax" on failing to spend your money on useful things. (Who gets the tax varies -- in a cryptocurrency case, probably the miners; in fiat, whoever is printing the money.)
The exact level of inflation that's useful is not clear (to me), and depends on a lot of stuff including the general pace of technological advancement, population growth rates, etc. But basically: more than zero, but not too much.

Sure. I was just pointing out what appeared to a confusion of terminology: "maintaining balance" has nothing to do with mining, transaction fees, inflation, deflation, or other stuff like that.

(Personally, I'm excited on a long-term scale. I think there are lots of shortcomings to Bitcoin, and I'm optimistic about them being solved, but not right away. Right now, the number of people I would seriously recommend it to who aren't highly technical is... very, very small.)

Go read up on the Kelly criteria.
Decide what odds you think Bitcoin has of succeeding. If this number is either 0% or 100%, you're doing it wrong. Feel free to define your own threshold for "success"; the details don't matter all that much.
Now take a stab at "price if Bitcoin succeeds". If it's a 3-digit number or less, I'd suggest that you're probably still doing it wrong.
Now, drop those into the Kelly criteria. You'll get an answer, and it won't be "invest everything".
At an absolute maximum, invest a smaller fraction of your investable funds than the odds you put on success. If you think the payoff for success is non-astronomical, go well less than that. (These conclusions are based on the Kelly criteria.)
As for how? I would buy with Coinbase, and then move it to my own wallet. If you haven't figured out cold storage yet, buy with Coinbase, store it in the Coinbase Vault, and move a tiny bit to your software wallet. Figure out cold storage using those coins to test, then move the remainder once you're comfortable.

If Bitcoin is only worth a half a trillion or something, that only implies a decrease in real purchasing value of the dollar of a couple percent. That's not enough to make people panic.

Just to be clear, I'm in favor of free speech for everyone. Including speech that is offensive, hateful, illegal, or otherwise makes people upset and causes problems. There's a difference between supporting that, and believing that all speech should be welcome in all forums, or believing that there should never be consequences for speech.
And in case you doubt the sincerity of that, I've put in a nontrivial amount of effort and dollars and compute time to provide forums for such speech, mostly in the form of the Freenet network. Which definitely has a fairly high concentration of speech I find offensive and problematic.
So the question is, what will make a good forum for talking about bitcoins? I think you'd agree that there's such a thing as a post that shouldn't be on this forum, because it's offtopic or badly written or redundant or whatever, and that downvoting and telling the poster that is a reasonable response. Why shouldn't we extend the same treatment to posts that are likely to make a large number of possible participants feel unwelcome and offended, when the reasons for that are entirely unrelated to bitcoins?

Huh? The price of bitcoin went down, so you lost money. That money is already lost. Get over it. Spending now won't make you lose more money.
That said, it might go up again. You might make it back. Personally, I think that's likely, so I'm holding bitcoins.
I also spend them; for small amounts, I just spend and don't worry about, and replenish occasionally. For large amounts, I replenish immediately. Easy enough. This is because I'm basically using dollars for cash flow (makes sense, since that's how my salary, rent, utility bills, etc. are denominated) and bitcoins as savings / investment and occasionally as payment method.

I'm excited about this product (and supported you on IndieGoGo!), but I'm a little disappointed that it sounds like you're doing innovative stuff with the hardware and the basic product ideas, but doing business as usual for the security.
While what I actually asked was simply


the question I really meant was more like "how do you plan to prove to the users of this device that there can't be a backdoor". You answered a question more like "how can we (the manufacturer) reasonably convince ourselves (not prove) that there wasn't a backdoor installed (not that there couldn't have been) by a specific one of our subcontractors?".
I hope you understand the distinction I'm making. It's like the difference between code that has a proof of correctness, vs code where the regression tests have not yet found any bugs. I understand that I'm asking about a higher standard than any existing products meet. But I feel like if there's a place for correctness proofs anywhere, then stuff intended for cold storage of bitcoins is a good candidate for them.

But I also think there's a bit too much reliance on "oh, it's open source, so it can't possibly have had a back door craftily installed" in this community.

Only temporarily. It's called price discovery.
When you go to spend those coins later, you'll reduce their value. If you lend them now, you reduce their value now. When you stop lending them, their value will go up slightly, and then back down slightly when you spend them.
All you're doing is moving that slight decline in value sooner. And getting paid interest for it.

Many operators have had policies about involved people riding on the airplane. Soviet Russia often had the lead engineer on early test flights. The US Army had the lead maintenance tech on the first helicopter flight after major maintenance for a while; I don't know if that's still current practice. I interned at a company building rocketplanes; company policy was everyone involved got a ride (not optional). That definitely included people involved with the software, of which there wasn't very much. Mostly because the engineering team had a very strong software background...

What is your definition of AI? It sounded to me like you're using a definition along the lines of "general purpose intelligence capable of solving any intellectual problem a person can". But the poster you replied to was talking about a system for managing a money supply.
In the AI world, the general-purpose intelligence is usually referred to as AGI (artificial general intelligence), strong AI, or something otherwise more specific than just "AI". Both historically and in the current field, the term AI is often used to include domain-specific programs that are not isomorphic to AGI.
I don't see why high quality handling of an economy is a problem that requires AGI, given the long list of hard problems that have been successfully handled by AI (not AGI) so far.
Do you have a citation about the fischer variation? I assume you're referring to Chess960, not a specific opening line variation?

I'm happy to argue that Bitcoin has the parameters set incorrectly. But the basic idea of handing it out as miner rewards makes sense: it subsidizes the security of the blockchain (more hashing power makes it harder to attack), and the source of the subsidy is a dilution of existing coins. In other words, people who store value on the block chain are being taxed (via inflation) to pay for securing that same value.
I really have no idea what the best rate for that subsidy is. I'm not even sure having it dwindle to zero is correct. I'd be fairly surprised if the Bitcoin subsidy schedule turned out to be "perfect". But... I don't think it's awful, either. In some ways, I suspect it is too high for too long (it keeps transaction fees elevated), and in some ways I think having it dwindle to zero is dangerous and unfair (charging people who use Bitcoin for transactions, but not those who use it to store value).
Also, the PoW approach, in a large and healthy coin, does not hand out *profits* in an unfair manner. The mining market has a combination of downward size scalability (not perfect, but much stronger than most other markets), modest but not zero capital costs, and near-perfect competition, that I would expect most miners to spend nearly all (and if they get it wrong, slightly more than) their rewards on capital expenses and electricity.

If it was because of the moving average, they would be shifted less than 504 blocks, meaning they would show up in the first quarter of the 2016-block difficulty window. They're actually showing up closer to the middle, more like 1000 blocks in.
That's what the [chart]( that posted was trying to show you. The vertical black lines are 504 blocks after the difficulty change, and represent the last time an event at the difficulty change would have an impact on the MA. The little horizontal bars show the amount of lag that is completely unexplained by the "blame it on the averages" theory. (And they are maximally conservative about it, too.)

I wasn't even bothering to compare ME to that approach. I suppose I should have, since it seems like a common one. Standard approaches suck right now :/
My main point of comparison was booting a live CD on a disconnected laptop and printing from that. Which is a lot of work.


I think this provides a false sense of security. To pick an obvious one, if the backdoored entropy source was the output of Dual_EC_DRBG, I don't know how I could analyze the entropy source and find the problem, but it would obviously be a bad idea to use it.
This seems useful for verifying that my RAM chip is working the way that paper says it should, but not for saying anything about back doors.


I really like this. Low trust requirement, and an attacker has to compromise two things without having an obvious link between them.
Once I have a printout of key, a printout of H(entropy), and a salt, how do I verify it? In particular, it seems like it just kicks the security problem onto the computer doing the verification, since everything required to generate the key ends up on that computer.
In practice, of course, that sort of malware seems much harder to write than stuff that simply notices people running special-purpose bitcoin software. But if we're being paranoid already...
What about this?
Write a salt onto the stick. Then generate key = H(H(entropy_1) + salt) + H(H(entropy_2) + salt), and print all of [key, salt, H(e1), H(H(e1) + salt), H(e2), H(H(e2) + salt)]. (+ could be arithmetic addition or XOR; either should be fine.) The user can then verify exactly one of the outer hashes on an insecure computer, and can verify the additions by hand (literally, pen and paper, no computer).
Now an attacker needs to coordinate a backdoor to your entropy generator with stealing the salt, as opposed to a single point where they steal both. In order for you to backdoor it, you have to correctly guess which of the two hashes I'm going to verify by computer. If I have a computer I can trust, I can just check both of them (making it equivalent to your version). If I'm feeling extra paranoid, I generate 10 wallets, choose one at random to use for real, verify only one of its two hashes, and verify both of the hashes for the other 9.

The amazing thing that makes bitcoin work is how wonderfully it aligns various incentives. It incentivizes mining through block rewards and fees. The block rewards start high to provide a subsidy for securing the network early on, but then taper. It eventually becomes non-inflationary because anything else would incentivize a move to a different option. It incentivizes distribution of the early coins (to pay for mining costs).
And it also incentivizes evangelism. And development. And improving the network. People that own bitcoin are incentivized to improve it for everyone, because that way they get rich.
Your question is misguided. You're asking if there's a causal link from getting rich to evangelism, but missing the point that they both come from a common cause of properly designed incentives, which is both why bitcoin will work and why it can make the early adopters rich.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:11:41
I'm inclined to agree. However: Some people perceive it as non-negligible. That matters more than the actuality. And network latency effects mean it's not precisely zero; the number I'm seeing thrown around is 0.16%, and that math behind that looked vaguely reasonable. Also, pool variance matters, even if the expectation is the same.

The Kelly Criteria is your friend, here. It tells you how much to invest in a bet given the payout being offered and your odds of winning, in order to maximize your long-term rate of return over many bets / investment decisions. And yes, you can bet too much on a bet with a high expected value (say, a coin flip paying out at 3:2; don't bet everything on that).
For bets with high expected value, you should invest a percentage of your bankroll that is a bit less than your projected odds of winning the bet. So, if you think bitcoin has 75% chance of going significantly up in value (&gt; 10x, say), you should invest a bit less than 75% of your bankroll.
That said... there's nothing wrong with looking at your future earnings, taking their net present value, and counting that as part of your bankroll. Just... make sure those future earnings are certain, not speculative.

Right. And if that happens in a way that is concentrated in one currency, you'll get hyperbitcoinization there. But I suspect you'd have to see a purchasing power reduction of more than typical annual inflation numbers (say, &gt;2%) to cause a serious problem for the original currency.
So small currencies are vulnerable with the right set of external conditions. Larger currencies (like the Dollar or Euro) aren't vulnerable until Bitcoin starts to have total purchasing power (market cap, whatever you want to call it) of a meaningful fraction of the currency in question. So you won't see this effect happen to dollars until the total value of Bitcoin is already somewhere in the $500B range or so ($100B seems unlikely but plausible to me, $10B seems right out). By then we'll have already seen a couple more bubble cycles.
Of course, it's possible there will be some catalyst other than a reduction in the purchasing power of the fiat currency. Possibly FOMO from looking at Bitcoin price growth, possible something else.

When you tax a sale, you change the quantity of sales made and the price. Whether the purchaser or consumer "pays" the tax (or rather, what fraction each pays) depends on the relative supply and demand elasticities in that area of the curve. In other words: some taxes get paid by one party, some by the other.
The same is true more generally: where you apply the tax does matter to who pays it. Taxing salaries is not the same thing as taxing corporate profits, which is not the same as taxing corporate revenue.
It is by no means obvious to me which of these is best. (And for large-ish tax rates, a combination is probably the right answer.) But they are definitely *not* economically equivalent, even though employees and shareholders will end up paying some of the tax.

That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that the *decline* in the moving average must represent either a real decline in network hash rate, or noise in the underlying data.
Because the decline happens more than 504 blocks after the change in difficulty, if it represents a real decrease in hashrate, then that decrease in hashrate happens well after the difficulty change. Ditto the peaks: they show a change in hashrate that happens well after the difficulty change.
So, why are these hashrate spikes happening in the middle of a difficulty window? I don't know. But I do know that your explanation of "blame it on the data filtering" doesn't fit.

I consider AI to include domain specific problems, for a variety of reasons: it's a useful definition (there seems to be a group of related problems that it's useful to talk about), the industry generally seems to like using that term, and we have a good term (well, several, but whatever) for the strong AI case. I also think that progress in AI is a meaningful building block toward AGI, even though I think we're still a very long way off from that. (I don't think we've made progress in the sense of I don't think there exists even a very bad AGI or a start at one; I do think we have progress on the building blocks, and AIXI is an excellent reductio ad absurdum toy model of a strong AI.)
But that's not really that relevant...


That's one of my main objections to any such plan. Along with the related: how will we trust them to do a good a job, and not twist the AI decisions to their own ends? (Obvious answer: it's an open source algorithm implemented on the blockchain. That sounds like a bit of a research project, though...)
And even if you solve that problem: why would people use your alternative? I'm pretty sure the nash equilibrium moves toward a cryptocurrency with a hard limit on the eventual supply, because selfish individual actors don't want their savings inflating.

That is not how moving averages work. They don't overshoot. Which means that your explanation doesn't fit the data; specifically, your explanation predicts that you won't see the drops in hash rate.
Now, it could simply be that the block time is noisy (it is an exponential random number, after all), and the 504 window is not offering enough smoothing. I haven't looked far enough back to get a sense for whether this is a real pattern, and I certainly haven't run any statistical tests.

Social norms and market norms don't operate at the same time. (See: heuristics and biases literature, behavioral economics, etc. For a particularly readable introduction, Predictably Irrational or Thinking Fast and Slow are good choices.) In the trash on the street case, you're using social norms. In the mining case, it's a market norms question. When you add money, the social norms lose their hold. If there was a machine at every trash bin that paid you for throwing out stuff, and the payout was very small, the number of people throwing out stuff would go *down*. Because suddenly they would ask whether it was worth it, not whether it was the right thing to do.

Not huge, but relevant. This is the primary consideration that sets the transaction fee, and is also why the natural units for transaction fees are satoshis per byte, rather than some other currency (eg dollars, even though miners are paying electric and Internet bills in dollars) or per transaction instead of per B or whatever. And also why transaction fees don't naturally change with the exchange rate, but do naturally change with the block reward.
(Also note that not all miners use perfectly optimized calculations, and the optimal calculation will depend on the miner's network connection speed and related factors, and that the reference client doesn't do this.)

I suspect the micro side of the money assumptions will end up more closely matching reality, and the macro side will have to adjust a bit.
Obviously any research that assumes a central authority controlling the money supply in response to economic factors does not apply very well.
One simple implication: if choice of currency is an option, and people choose their currency based on economic factors, why would they ever choose to use a currency that might be subject to an expanded money supply, when they have one with a fixed money supply available? Even if a centrally-controlled money supply would be an improvement for everyone (which is not a point I'd grant lightly, but...), why would an individual actor choose to use such a currency if they don't have to? It seems the Nash equilibrium would be a currency with a fixed supply.

However, BFX takes a 15% cut of the interest payment as fees. So the lender receives closer to 0.085%/day, which compounds imperfectly. Achievable real rate is 30-35%. And normally the rates are lower than that on BTC.

Bitcoin doesn't *continue* to get less fair. New bitcoins are handed out to people who are incentivized to spend nearly all of them on electricity and hardware, in a highly competitive market. In fact, that market appears to be so competitive that on average it might well be losing money.
Whether the initial distribution was fair or not... Depends on what you mean by fair, I guess. But I'm not too worried about it, since it's done and mostly irrelevant now and unfixable.

So, I haven't spent much time trying to find out what you guys have already done on this project; if there is an FAQ I should be reading or some whitepapers, please let me know. (I'm at work, so a more detailed reply will have to wait, if you're interested.)
What threat models are you considering? Which of them does using ME make me more secure against, and which does it make me less secure against? Which do I gain security against by re-flashing the firmware myself, and which do I do better against by just using the stock hardware and never connecting it to anything but the printer?
I assume that the reason I want to use ME in the first place is because I find a threat model of "my local PC is compromised by some sort of bitcoin-stealing advanced persistent threat" to be credible. Under that threat model, what benefit does flashing my ME gain me?
I think you should have a useful way of trying to verify the firmware on the ME without relying on the availability of a highly secured computer. For example, can I at least read out the existing firmware without putting it into a flashable state?
If I can do that, how do I confirm that the firmware the ME reads out to me is the same one that's actually running? Quining programs could act in clever ways here; "Reflections on Trusting Trust" comes to mind. Binary compression followed by stuffing the rest of the flash memory with an uncompressible (and uncomputable) nothing-up-my-sleeve number comes to mind. (First N bitcoin block hashes with the leading zeros / low-entropy bits removed?)
Is there a way for me to repeat the verification of the SRAM? In specific, it seems useful to read out the full contents that you're using as an entropy source, before the ME does any hashing / entropy compression.

Widespread adoption implies a price greater than $100k, and probably less than $10M. The obvious way to come up with these figures is to look at the extant fiat money supply. That's (very roughly speaking) how much money the world has a use for. The $100k price tag assumes some sort of coexistence with fiat currency, which seems a little unlikely. The $10M estimate might be too low if some of the current big holders are willing to keep holding longer than I expect they will.

Yes. As I said above:


I'm well aware that these things are linked; that was basically the point of my post above. I still think it's useful to examine the "all else equal" cases as a starting point, and primarily to highlight how they differ from reality.


Block size has increased, but not max block size (unless you're talking about what now amounts to ancient history...). At fixed max block size, you'd expect fees to go up as blocks get bigger (and more competitive).
I think it's pretty clear the economics of transaction fees right now are not driven by competitive rational actors. I think the settings in the default code and the min fee to relay are for more relevant than competitive profit-driven decisions at this time.

The criticism is "the distribution will continue to be unfair in the future". Alternately, "handing out coins at the start and incentivizing people to sell them smells fishy."

The problem is that you can't just say "all else equal..." and get a useful analysis. You can't assume that making blocks bigger will result in more fees because more transactions; you'll also see a decline in per-transaction fees. It's a competitive market, both on the user's side when selecting fees and on the miner's side when selecting transactions to include. Changes will interact with both of these, and will also have larger influences like how useful Bitcoin is and therefore what the price is.
With very large blocks, fees will generally go down until it's just barely profitable for a miner to include the transaction. Miners won't hold out for higher fees than that, because if they did that would just let some other miner get all those fees in the next block.
So the question is, if you make a change that decreases per-transaction fee, but increases the number of transactions, what happens? Also noting that your change will have an impact on the price of BTC, and therefore the block reward.
For a fuller explanation, see 
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:22:19
Uh... if you send the BTC to an address, it is sent to that address. If it is an address for which no one anywhere has a private key, then... Ooops. That BTC will be sitting at that address for a long, long time.

At present, the block subsidy is a competitor. It takes time per byte to send out a new block. If you make your block bigger, it takes longer, and increases the odds of another miner sending out a block first. So it costs you money to include a zero-fee transaction, because it increases the chances of you missing out on the whole block reward.
Now at present, plenty of miners include zero-fee transactions anyway, because that's what the default software does. But they don't have to, and the economics says they probably shouldn't, normally.
Once the block reward gets smaller, this source of competition will be dominated by other transaction fees; competition among miners could drive those fees lower.
(To be clear: I'm strongly in favor of much larger block sizes. I think transactions waiting for artificial scarcity will push people away from Bitcoin, and any hint of that will raise too many doubts about scaling.)

As said, it's about where the private keys are stored.
There are a bunch of options, of varying levels of security, and suitable for different threat models. Here are a few (not comprehensive):
Private key on Internet-connected computer, not encrypted (or decryption key on same computer): very low security, suitable when you have software making unattended spending decisions.
Private key on an Internet-connected computer, encrypted with password that must be entered per use: A typical "hot" wallet. Low security, suitable for most low to mid value storage, when you want convenience to spend your bitcoins. Might be a mobile device, laptop, whatever.
Private key generated on an Internet-connected computer, printed out, then deleted from that computer: low-grade offline storage. Secure against future hacking of the computer, not secure if you were compromised at the time of generation. Better than a hotwallet by a bit, details depending on threat models.
Private key generated by a computer that never makes an Internet connection afterwards, stored on that computer or on paper only: Good quality "cold" storage. Best for long term storage, difficult to use.
Again, there are plenty of variations on those options and others not mentioned. But basically, it's about what an attacker would have to do to get a copy of your private key.

So, for starters, I'm of the opinion that bigger blocks would be a good thing for all parties. I think it will make bitcoin more useful, increase the price, result in more fees, etc. However, I also think the results of such a change are complex and not trivial to analyse.
I think that, at present, blocks count as large (because they're rarely full) but not very large (because sometimes they are full); I think what counts as a large block size limit is obviously in relation to network usage.
And lastly... I agree that artificially constricting block sizes is a horribly short-sighted way to increase fees.
I'm actually against artificial restrictions on block size for reasons of increasing fees; I think any limits should basically be about spam and keeping the cost of running a full node vaguely sane. I like Gavin's original proposal of 20MB now and automatic increases. But, if you wanted to do a dynamic thing, note that block size is relevant [long before blocks are actually full](

That ignores the fact that some miners (and especially amateur miners) behave in weird ways, that aren't the same weird ways investors behave. In particular, I don't see how to fit amateur miners who keep hardware running when their marginal cost is higher than the market price into that model. I know that's an extreme example, but I think "I'm a miner!" has cognitive bias effects beyond that, that aren't the same biases investors hold.

Proof of reserves only works for the crypto assets; such are the drawbacks of fiat. If you want proof of fiat reserves, you need a traditional audit. That's less than thrilling, but the crypto proof is still a lot better than nothing.
As for your other complaint: this is why traditional regulations require accounting separation of customer and corporate funds. It's perfectly possible for an exchange, brokerage, bank, or whatever to go bankrupt, default on its loans, and be unable to pay its creditors while still remaining solvent and having all of the customer's funds. In that context, full proof of reserves provides a clear benefit to customers.
Proof of reserves doesn't fix everything: it can't prevent the exchange from running off with your money. And it can't prevent them from mingling funds. But it does put a limit on how bad things can get, and make it harder to engage in certain sorts of shady stuff.

Short version: without double entry accounting, it's really easy to cook the books, and really hard to tell an honest mistake from a theft. This basically meant you had to trust your accountants. That means family businesses only, for the most part. It meant you couldn't let someone else handle shipping and selling your goods over long distances.
With double entry accounting, firms can get larger, trade becomes easier and more profitable, larger projects become viable, etc. It's a really big deal.
I'd put double-entry accounting up there with paper money in terms of impact of innovation. I think we'll have to wait and see before we determine where Bitcoin ranks against them, but I suspect it's in the same ballpark.

All else being equal, larger blocks would result in lower per-transaction fees; large enough blocks would reduce total fees as well.
The problem is incentives. How small a fee do you include? Well, zero is silly, but you can profitably include a transaction with a very, very tiny fee. Your only costs are the time to validate it and generate a new block with it (which you can do while your previous block attempts are still hashing), plus the marginally increased odds that someone will beat you in the race to publish the next block.
Sure, you could not include the tiny fee block because you'd rather fees were higher. But if you don't, what's to stop someone else from including it? After all, they'd make a profit doing so.
The result is a race to the bottom, with fees being very close to the cost of validating and adding the transaction to the block, with nothing left to pay for things like miner profit, hashing power, data storage, etc.
Marginal cost equals marginal value.
Right now things are weird, because miners are still generally being charitable (including no-fee transactions) and the threshold for what counts as a fee for full-node propagation is higher than the cost of mining a transaction.
Remember: marginal cost drives price, and not much else. But it doesn't have to be that way right away, and things can stay weird for a while.
Now, all that said: all else is *not* equal. Bigger blocks are more useful. If we start running up against the blocksize limit, Bitcoin gets less useful, which slow adoption and hurts price. Miners definitely care about the price. And the current system of miner / full node collusion on transaction fee pricing seems to mostly be working, so fees probably won't fall in a competitive fashion for a while yet.

As I'm sure you're aware, that's a complicated question. There isn't a nice clean step by step answer, but it also isn't as simple as "you can't".
In general, you can't prove hardware in a mathematical sense. The best you can do is prove things about physical models of hardware. Some things fit their models closely, others don't. Sometimes the best you can do is empirical data about the hardware.
That said...
You start by proving the software. All proofs start with assumptions and come in pieces; a final proof is a chain of pieces. In this case, you'll probably have a step that says "assume the SRAM produces at least this much usable noise, in a fashion that meets these conditions". That step is justified by things like that paper you're basing this whole thing on, and verified by testing the actual SRAM model and individual chips. Then you have an actual proof, with some more assumptions, whose conclusion is "if the SRAM behaves like it should, then the RNG is secure".
As for actual proofs about the SRAM... well, it's hard. I don't think you can do it. You could prove quantum resistor noise if you wanted to; that's how I would have recommended solving the problem. But depending on the cost and size of the SRAM, that might add a couple dollars to the final price tag; I don't know if that would be accessible. (If you're curious, I could come up with an actual cost estimate; I've done the estimate before but my prices are out of date.)
That said, for my personal use, I have no qualms about SRAM startup noise. Ditto for recommending it for any other practical use for someone else. I just have a bias to more provable stuff, even when in practice I think the demonstrated security is equivalent.

When the dollar was backed by metals, that was a promise by the issuing authority (the US government) to redeem dollars for metal on demand.

However, afaik, there was no corresponding promise to issue dollars in return for metal.

Many of the early blocks were mined with a particular pattern to the seeds that appears to be unique to Satoshi's mining setup. They seem to have been the only one mining seriously for a while.

Yes, but in this context the physics definition is not the relevant one; the relevant criteria is an economic one.

Yes, clearly. Something like that must be the answer, in practice.
The question I was trying to point at is: why does that work in consumer tech? Why wouldn't is also work in other areas of the economy? In practice, consumer tech works in an economy with steady (and non-trivial!) price deflation. Most of the simple arguments for why steady predictable deflation is bad apply in full to the consumer tech industry. Yet things seem fine there. This would seem to be a counterexample to those arguments.
As a result, I think "people will stop buying stuff because it would be cheaper next year" is a faulty argument.
I think there are other, reasonable arguments why steady deflation is bad, and why having it across the whole economy might be worse than in one sector. I just think that *particular* argument is deeply flawed, despite being quite common. And I think the example of the tech sector is quite sufficient to refute it.

When your broker or another large entity trades stocks, equities, bonds, etc. on an exchange, they're making promises to deliver the cash and the instruments. Unlike a typical bitcoin exchange, the exchange doesn't take possession of the goods before the trader can trade. After committing to a trade, the traders have a 3-day period to handle settlement (aka actually delivering the cash or financial instruments involved in the trade).
(This all makes much more sense in a context where "settlement" literally means delivery extremely valuable pieces of paper, or visiting a trusted 3rd party who is holding them and having them update their paper ledgers of who owns what.)

Using energy is not required. *Proof* of *work* is required. You can prove human effort, you can prove expended energy, you can prove you poured out some booze for the blockchain. Anything that provably destroys wealth will suffice equally well for the economics.
The problem is that only one of those is effective for the cryptography. Only one of those results in a data structure that proves itself.

Yes, you pay higher fees because Coinbase isn't using Segwit.
All the bytes in the block, segwit or no, count toward the 4M weight limit. The non-Segwit bytes count at 4 weight/B, the Segwit bytes at 1 weight/B. Even Segwit transactions have some non-Segwit bytes counted at 4W/B.
So yes, you'll pay more fees if you don't use Segwit than if you do. But Coinbase is using up more block weight than they need to, by not using Segwit transactions. Which means the blocks fill up with fewer transactions in them, which means the price per weight is higher, because people bid the price up.

Bitcoin will get there eventually. And it will get there faster, more efficiently, and as a better promoter of equality if the current participants put a little bit of effort into understanding their own biases, whether racial or gender or economic.

The concept of an "anonymity set" is useful here. You're never anonymous with respect to the entire world, just within a set of plausible candidates. When you mix coins, your anonymity set is (roughly, if the mixing is well done, etc.) the set of people you mixed your coins with. When you go check taint analysis, your set is limited to the set of addresses you checked the taint on.
Of course the details all get complicated. Checking more than one address is definitely an improvement, but be aware that it might not fix all the damage done by checking the address you care about.
tl;dr: just use TOR.

Yes, please do. Unconscious bias is a thing, and you can't do something about it without talking about it. It's a bad thing that the Bitcoin world is so male-dominated, because of what it implies about why women aren't involved. One way (of many) to help fix that is raise awareness of women doing good things in the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:30:16
There's lots of good research about unconscious bias. If you think you don't care at all about gender, even unconsciously, you're probably wrong. That doesn't inherently mean you're a bad person or anything, but regardless of your gender you probably exhibit gender biases that you wouldn't like. Trying to not talk about it is not a good way to improve the situation.

There's a lot of crap wrong with the world that needs fixing. If you want to fix it, I'm in favor.

Try reversing the framing. Would you build a Bitcoin client "just for men"? Would you host a Bitcoin conference "just for men"? Why not? You wouldn't normally assume someone's opinion isn't worth hearing just because of their gender, right?
OK, but here's the thing: your brain and mine don't work the way we wish they do. There's lots of good research that says people exhibit gender biases. For instance, they perceive women as talking too much when they talk less than their fair share. This results in women not getting to say as much.
If you said you didn't want to build a space that was just (or primarily) for men intentionally, and then you discovered you were doing exactly that by accident, would you take steps to correct it? Why not?
I'm sure I exhibit gender bias. I'm sure you do too. It's a very rare person who doesn't. No one knows exactly how to completely fix this. We do, however, know some things that are both easy to do and seem to help. Raising awareness by posting articles like this seems to help a bit, and it doesn't hurt anyone.
I'm certainly not saying all Bitcoin articles should be "women in Bitcoin" articles, or even all that many of them. But the occasional one is a good thing.
If you're serious about spreading Bitcoin adoption as much as possible, then yes, you should pay attention to experts on bias. Because what they're basically telling you is that you're not doing as good a job as you could be, and that there are really cost-effective ways to do better.

I care about all of those things. When someone says "save the rainforests" they're not trying to say "fuck all other kinds of forests". Right now I'm advocating for better gender representation. If someone writes an article about "people of color in Bitcoin", I'll be all in favor of that too. And if someone replies to that by saying "what about women? don't you care about women and poor people and the third world?" my answer will be the same: yes, I care about all of those things. But I can't fix everything at once.
I'm all in favor of all kinds of equality, and I think one of the things about Bitcoin that's absolutely amazing is its potential to help the poor and the economically oppressed, to help people in the third world and developing countries whose governments use money as a tool of oppression. To help out in places where it's harder to get a bank account if you're of the wrong race or class, or live in the wrong part of town, are the wrong religion, or are the wrong gender.
So, given that I care about all these things, and also about promoting Bitcoin, and also about a whole bunch of other stuff, what should I do? My personal answer is to promote things I'd like to see more of, and not get too derailed by claims that one particular improvement isn't enough of an improvement.
So please, post articles about people of color in Bitcoin. Post articles about 3rd world Bitcoin startups. Post articles about Bitcoin and Islam-compatible money. I'm in favor of all of them.
I'm not trying to force any changes on anyone. I'm just trying to say "this article is a positive thing; I'd like more like it".

Strongly disagree. The use cases are narrow, limited, and insufficient to support the current price, but they decidedly exist. Present use cases where bitcoin unambiguously wins: dark markets; ransomware; online tipping. Those, combined with speculation, have gotten us where we are today.
I think where we agree is that the *next* such use case is non-obvious. Remittances are possible, but this article made me downgrade their likelihood.

If "common sense" and things that seemed "obvious" were always true, we wouldn't really need science. Sometimes good science is just confirming what we already knew.
To me, it wasn't terribly clear whether borrowing money from a bank created dollars directly, or triggered borrowing from the central bank which created dollars. This paper provides the empirical result that the money is created at the individual bank, not the central bank.

That's not what's normally meant by fractional reserve lending.
The usual definition goes like this. Suppose the reserve limit is 10%. The bank gets 10 dollars in deposits; the reserve limit means they're required to keep 1 dollar, but can loan out the other 9, which they promptly do. The recipients of those loans buy stuff with them, and the sellers then also deposit their money in the bank, which now has 10 dollars in reserve (and 19 in deposits) and needs to keep 1.9 of them, so they loan out 8.1 dollars.
This creates a multiplication effect, allowing there to be 100 dollars in total deposits on the books (and 90 dollars of loans).

Actually, this is specifically in contrast to fractional reserve banking. The abstract is pretty clear about that.
In fractional reserve banking, the effective amount of money is larger, because the same centrally-created dollars are viewed as assets in savings accounts by multiple people, mediated via loans.
Here, the loan is made with newly-created dollars, that aren't simply dollars from other customers multiplied via fractional reserve.

The Econ I took (Intro, micro, macro, foreign trade) seemed based around the theory of central bank creation, multiplied by fractional reserve lending at individual banks. I don't remember any discussion of other theories of fiat creation.

Originally, you were talking about price inflation as measured by consumer goods, specifically suits. Then monetary supply inflation. Now you're talking about inflation as measured by a new set of asset classes.
The point I'm trying to make was, and still is, in response to your original comment about the price of a decent suit as measured in ounces of gold. Specifically, I'm saying that it has changed a lot more in the past decade (or two) when measured in gold than when measured in nominal dollars. And I'm generalizing that this is also true for most normal consumer goods.

It's fairly normal to react to seeing lots of bias by specifically highlighting the opposite things. When you see a lot of bias in a news source, for instance, your response is mostly going to talk about ways that source is wrong or biased, and only pay a little attention to the things that it got right. I'm not saying this is necessarily correct or optimal, but it's definitely common and normal, and I don't think it's usually malicious.
This seems similar: most people talking about bitcoin remittances are fairly strongly biased pro-bitcoin. Personally, I think that's not surprising, and I think they're mostly correct, but they tend to have financial incentives to play up the positives and gloss over the negatives.
So I'm not surprised this article seems biased the other way. Try to read it charitably, and try to assume good intent from the authors. (I make no such charitable assumptions about buttcoiners, but I don't think this article was written by one.)
@_date: 2015-04-16 03:38:19
There's both supply inflation and price inflation. They're not the same thing, though they're related by the money velocity equation. There has obviously been inflation of the monetary supply in the last decade; the actual amount of price inflation is hard to figure out, as usual (or slightly more so), but isn't huge.
In your first comment, talking about the prices of suits, you were talking about price inflation. In this comment, talking about money printing, you're talking about supply inflation.
Mostly I was arguing that when you say this:


You're implying that the price of suit, as measured in ounces of gold, hasn't changed much in the past decade. Unless you're talking about wildly different suits, that's simply wrong.

Lending deposits out to other customers *is* fractional reserve banking. If fractional reserve banking were illegal, they couldn't do that, and would have to use bank funds (as opposed to customer funds) to lend out.

This only applies when there was not a prior agreement as to the method of payment. It's entirely possible to require the debt be paid in some specific manner, without running into trouble with legal tender law.
The interesting question is whether they can update those requirements on existing loans without requiring new signatures. If I had to guess, I'd guess yes on things like credit cards where new debt is being added and continued use can be seen as acceptance of the new policy, but that they might have trouble on things like a mortgage where the only continued use is making payments on existing debt. That's a court case I'd love to see.

The exposure should be similar; the risks for you losing the bitcoins vs the trust losing them are slightly different, but otherwise both prices will track the price of bitcoin, which is why they were buying GBTC. They can sell shares of GBTC on the OTC market, and then repurchase them through BIT (at spot price) if they want to continue holding shares. The only downside to that is then they have to keep holding them for a year.
So, people would not engage in this arbitrage if they: (don't want to hold BTC themselves AND don't want to hold BIT / GBTC shares for another year from now) OR (think the price differential is too small to be worth the hassle). I'm sure that explains why a few people aren't trading, but I'm highly skeptical of it explaining everyone.

That's not entirely true, if both parties have some extra bitcoin. Do a 2-party escrow (multisig) transaction, with inputs from both buyer and seller, in amounts larger than the sale. Release after the sale.

It prevents them from working.
In order to work, (blockchain-based, decentralized) prediction markets need to convert real-world events into data on the blockchain. That basically means trustworthy human judges entering the data. An incentive structure to make that work looks nearly impossible, but can actually be done. Obviously you have to pay the judges as part of that. [Bitcoin Hivemind]( is the only method I've seen for that. Importantly, it pays its judges from trading fees.
You might think that would be easy to implement on Ethereum. You'd be wrong. The problem is that Ethereum lets someone else build a parasitic contract on top of it, that implements a no-fee market and resolves based on the judges decisions without paying them.
Since no-one likes fees, presumably some large fraction of the large-volume traders would use this instead. That undermines the whole premise, and destroys the prediction market that's being parasitized.
But it's even worse than that. Ethereum is turing-complete. Blockchains are just data structures. There's no reason someone couldn't write an Ethereum contract that imports the block headers from Bitcoin, checks the proof of work, imports the block headers and decisions from Bitcoin Hivemind, checks that they're properly strutured, and uses the Hivemind decisions.
For now, that latter version would have very high ETH fees, because it's kinda complicated. But presumably ETH contracts will get cheaper over time.
So, as long as ETH permits arbitrary contracts to run with blockchain-enforced correctness, it permits parasites. And those parasites aren't even contained to within the ETH ecosystem. It can be toxic to other things around it.

Calling sidechains "tacked on" seems... mistaken. At least, I don't think it promotes the correct intuition about the security guarantees. 
Native support doesn't matter. Ability to continue securely executing the contract while keeping the underlying token stable in value matters. (Many smart contract ideas can tolerate modest fluctuation in value of the token; basically none of them could tolerate a huge crash.)
If Bitcoin adds a sidechain, then later removing it would mean the miners changing what rules they run under. Look to the scaling debate to see just how hard that might be to have happen. OTOH, if your native chain has a history of suddenly rewriting the rules to change the outcome of a smart contract they decided they didn't like, that might be bad.

First move advantage matters *for the value token*. It does not matter for the feature set.
Consider a simpler example than ETH. A cryptocurrency with truly anonymous transactions. Say the first implementation is its own blockchain with its own token. You want to make an anonymous transaction, so you buy some and send it. Then Bitcoin adds a sidechain with the same style of anonymous transaction. Now what? Why do you care which blockchain you use? You don't; they both provide the same service. Except that in one of them, the token you need to buy (and your counterparty needs to sell) is more stable and more liquid.

You privately mine a chain that follows the segwit rules, and force a reorg.You could even keep all the transactions (nearly) the same from block to block, and just force a reorg of the chain to change the coinbase outputs if you're feeling malicious only towards the miners.
Trying to run a blockchain with less than 50% of the existing hashpower is risky.
