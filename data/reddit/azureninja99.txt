They don't.
@_date: 2014-01-18 22:08:22
Oh shoot! I've been to this site recently!
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:33:14
Oh dang, that's only 2 hours away! :o
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:15:12
That is a real shame. Defiantly get your parents involved, this is unacceptable.
@_date: 2013-06-29 21:40:13
Thanks for telling me that! Now I'm gonna get all paranoid whenever I buy something.

That would mean that I need to ship it to them. I just wanna give them the code.
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:32:18
Yup, that's paypal!

Since when did the US have the right to seize domains?

Are you a lawyer, or are you just good at it?

In other words, the government wants to take control of the internet.

Make a petition on a site like this 
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:03:21
I signed
@_date: 2013-06-11 14:53:03
That's genius!
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:09:38
Ok, then 128001260 uBTC in 1 USD?
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:07:47
So do you suggest keeping all your money in your house?
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:55:23
I want one in my town
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:21:44
Oh, cool! But I doubt anyone would be interested in buying it.
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:16:22
Can't wait to see the entire thing! The trailer alone was amazing!

Make a petition 
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:19:36
Oh well. I have another idea though. Is there a way for me to trade a Walmart giftcard for Bitcoins? I got one sitting around.

@_date: 2013-06-29 02:06:51
My bank has never questioned my billions of steam purchases, so......
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:51:59
Sounds good to me :)
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:27:25
So how exactly does it work? Is there like a certain bitcoin expert person you need to talk to?
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:31:28
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:55:49
Did you even read the question?
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:03:07
And 6 places to the right for uBTC, right?
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:06:30
That's one nosy bank!
