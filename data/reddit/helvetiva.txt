Yeah exactly. Hire professionals to manage your taxes and then put together a safe investment portfolio. Live within your means and never worry about going broke again.

I did. And I play to buy back in soon. Just seeing if I can time the market for fun - looked like the dip wasn't over yet so I'm going to try buying cheaper. To each his own.

Check recently cleared blocks on blockchain.info to see what kinds of transactions are going through. Every couple blocks you'll see $0.10-$0.25 fee transactions the whole way down. Use a wallet with custom fees to set it how you want and you're good to go.

Segregated Witness. It's essentially new tech that makes transactions smaller, which allows more transactions to fit on each block, which will free up space on the blockchain and make transactions cheaper as it becomes more widely adopted. Plenty to read about it on this sub and elsewhere.

If I understand correctly, you'll get the amount of bitcoin that you bought when the transaction was first placed. If it clears at $4800 USD/BTC then your bitcoin will be worth more USD than when you bought it.

Sorry, what's FUD?

I wish you the best of luck. Looks like I sold the dip... live and learn!
