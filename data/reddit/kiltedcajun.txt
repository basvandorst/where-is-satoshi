Or you could just click "Other ways to give" at the bottom of that page and quit being a bitch.

Send me a message. I do sell them. The website isn't finished yet.

Eventually, you're going to have to turn that BTC into USD. As much as you'd like, you can't pay for everything with BTC. You've gotta pay a mortgage, pay other bills, but more stock, etc.

Working on it, but not quite yet. Ledetdesigns.com redirects to my etsy store with hardly anything posted. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 17:23:24
Yeah, I saw that when posted it. Anyone can post anything and state "Oh, my cousin works for XXX and this is an internal email". I'll post here when I finally talk to PayPal.
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:42:03
I've found that it's really out of date. People don't keep up with the prices or if they even have any bitcoin to sell. The 4 or 5 people I've contacted from there all said they needed to delete the ad. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:09:26
I've been in there many times...
@_date: 2013-06-30 15:08:10
Wrong. I didn't think I knew better. I have made numerous transactions for Bitcoin on PayPal and have never had a problem. There's a huge difference between thinking you know better and thinking it wouldn't happen to you. 
Now, if I wanted someone to be an asshole to me about this, I would call PayPal. So, rather then sitting here and telling me how stupid I was, why don't you offer something constructive to the conversation?

I have my wallet address in a note. They login to the wallet of their choice (they all used coinbase) and copy/paste my address to send me money. I did it in incognito so they would feel safe about entering their passwords into a device they didn't own. One guy just did it on his phone taking a pic of the QR code. They all bought small items, so it was small transactions (less than .2 BTC each)
@_date: 2013-05-25 20:22:38
Thanks man.

Once again... pain in the ass.
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:39:09
Yup... only the world's reserve currency...
@_date: 2013-07-28 21:34:22
That's not true. I've been into tech my entire life and my penmanship is quite good.
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:47:36
Did you read the post at all?
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:31:53
There is nothing in PayPal's support docs that say they do not allow the sale of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:24:32
Easy and quick... but Bitinstant takes a cut and zipzap takes their cut. I'm paying TWO fees to buy bitcoin that way and I'm still having to use a third or even fourth party. There's nothing easy or quick about having to go hunt down a place where I can make the cash payment and paying two different companies fees to buy the bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-05 18:35:11
We just did the transactions on my ipad in an incognito window of Chrome. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:38:35
It's just the correction we all knew was coming.
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:31:02
Dude, it was a fucking joke. $Infinity??? REALLY? What idiot would believe that?
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:57:37
What I'm saying is that for PayPal to not allow the sale of something, they need to explicitly state that in their terms. They don't do that, therefore they have to support it. 
Even though I have read here that it has happened to other people, I didn't think it would happen to me. Now that it has happened, I will fight with PayPal in order to get my money back. PayPal, being the largest online payment company out there, will have to make a public statement sooner or later about using their service for the trade of Bitcoin. 
On the other hand, the user was a verified member on LocalBitcoins, therefore if PayPal appears to be a dead end, I hope that LocalBitcoins will work with me in order to get the users information and pass that to local law enforcement.

Really? All you have to do is ask for tips? That works???

Guess I'll have to settle for 21 million.
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:44:37
Well, what I do is really a hobby, not so much a business (I'm a network engineer by trade), so I don't mind taking the gamble. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:21:48
So, the title says "what can be done to speed things up". Then I follow it with...


How does your post add anything to this conversation? I have obviously used Coinbase since I posted about it, but I mention that it's too slow. You reply that Coinbase is pretty good. I've already said that it's too slow and I'm making a post asking how things can be sped up. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 15:55:33
And just where do you store those keys? Chances are his wallet is on that computer. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:33:52
I know I'll be asked, so I'll get this out of the way now.
I used [this page]( for the basic idea and a bit of the code. Since his 60 second refresh didn't work on me, I created a shell script to do the refresh for me.
create a file called ticker.sh (I used nano).
    
    while true
    do
     /home/pi/lcdscreen/ticker.py
     sleep 60
    done
Then, follow that with:
    nohup ./ticker.sh &amp;
That assumes that you named the python code ticker.py and you added the python path ( to the top of the python code and chmod +x it to make it executable. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:39:52
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:18:47
Yes, it does. That same fluctuation has the opposite effect sometimes too.

He said +5....
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:42:29
What do I do with $ Infinity though?
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:49:57
Maybe because it's a pain in the ass to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-03 20:05:16
I don't know. I don't want to take the chance of trying it. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:53:53
And when the big correction that we all know is coming actually happens, are you going to go back to want it was before?
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:24:56
It was no easier before the government stepped in. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 15:19:38
They found him. You think they won't seize his computer/phone/etc? 
@_date: 2013-06-30 14:41:57
I'm not pleading ignorance. What I'm saying is that PayPal doesn't explicitly state that they do not allow the sale of Bitcoin, therefore it is a sale of a product like any other product. So, until such time that they put in their support docs that the sale of Bitcoin is not allowed, they have to allow it and support it. I'll fight with them, primarily because I don't have much else to do and because I've won against PayPal in small claims court before. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:48:18
Explain to me, exactly, why this would have never happened with Bitcoin? The financial laws of the United States are the same whether you are depositing USD, Gold, Silver, JPY, EUR, or GBP. If you are depositing it into a US Bank account, you are bound by US Law.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:08:29
The whole order did go through. Look at the screen shot. I have tried their Twitter page, no answer on that either.
@_date: 2013-05-25 20:23:21
Sure... can you blow me first?
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:45:30
Yes, you're right about the stability. If I chose to, I could turn around and sell that Bitcoin immediately. When I'm paid, you actually plug in the amount of USD you want to send to me and it simply converts that to BTC and sends it to me. I choose to hold on to the BTC to see what the market is going to do and take the "gamble" of getting more out of that BTC than originally planned. I don't have to take that gamble. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 20:24:01
Don't worry baby... I'll only put the tip in...
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:52:47
It looks like every other cgminer screen, but it stops at AMU 59. The hash rate does not increase either. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:50:34
Actually, many businesses take gambles every day. The gamble that accepting bitcoin brings with it is really low compared to some of the gambles that companies take. Think of it like this... Your 401(k) is a giant gamble because it's all in the stock market. If you own gold or any other precious metal, it's a gamble. Bitcoin is no different than gold in that there's risk and reward. Hell, the US Dollar fluctuates all the time, so don't think of accepting Bitcoin as any different than accepting any other sort of currency. It's as good as gold in my book.
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:06:16
Poe's law man... 
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:50:15
It's no more a "perfect match" for Bitcoin as it is for USD, CAD, gold, silver, or beaded jewels. It's a fucking currency, nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:18:01
You need to think of Bitcoin as nothing more than another form of payment, not as a gamble. If someone offered me gold in lieu of USD, I'd accept it, so why not Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-06-03 22:48:27
Then why haven't hey fixed it on the site? I'm not taking the chance...
I just signed up for an account today and I saw that today. You'd think they would have fixed the website. Hell, that screenshot means nothing to me.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:45:12
What if two people see that and both bid, say, $100. Then someone's screwed out of $100, not $0.11. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:47:49
Hmm... I doubt it. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:50:57
Look man, I fully understand that there's a security risk and they do too. But, it's what we had at the time that worked. Things will be better at the next show, I'll be better prepared. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 20:18:47
You told me not to buy a Kimber. I never had a problem with that one or any of the other ones I have bought. As far as it being a "character flaw", just because I don't follow the advice of strangers on the internet doesn't mean that I am flawed. In this situation, I guess you can say that my flaw came from being too trusting of strangers on the internet. I trusted that someone wouldn't reverse a transaction on me. I was wrong on that, and I admitted it. As far as you saying that I deserve to get fucked over? Fuck you.

Yeah, that is pretty messed up.
