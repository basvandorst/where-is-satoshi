My own wallet. They accepted a 0-confirmation tx with 1 sat/byte. Mempool was empty.

Definitely best one. The only one where I can control everything: private keys, address type, tx fee etc.

I paid twice in bitcoin yesterday, both were using the same software. I think it's something special for the Bitcoin Valley, cause on their app I saw the same logo as in the bitcoinvalley.eu homepage. Maybe someone from around there can confirm

Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks for pointing that out.

Difficulty adjustment happens [every 2016 blocks]( So no, the miner would have found 2016*50 bitcoin really quickly then only 50 per 10 minutes.

The angles still could mean something, if the seed was constructed *after* the word cloud was generated.

OP could have generated the word cloud first thing they did, and only afterwards connected BIP39 words through clues to form a seed. Then OP could have used the angles, or whatever properties of the picture, however they wanted as they turned out.
It depends on if you assume that OP created the seed (and password) first and then the word cloud, or the other way around. I guess it's more probable that the seed was created first.. but can't be sure.

I love Gramatik's music. I saw him live once. He's quite a performer as well, he got a friend playing sax on stage that time. When I found out he was into crypto I was happy. Too bad he's an eth supporter as well but you can't get everything

Incredible art

You definitely can

Further down he states "1 BTC = 3,580 USD". So obviously, he uses comma for grouping and in fact wants to get 2 USD. Later on in the conversion he put 0.58.. BTC instead of µBTC, that is where the true mistake lies ^^
