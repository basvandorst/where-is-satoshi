Thanks for the upload! Good to see Bitcoin work its way onto Google's radar

Here's a mathematical explanation:
Calculate the number of blocks per 4 year cycle:
6 blocks per hour
* 24 hours per day
* 365 days per year
* 4 years per cycle
= 210,240
~= 210,000
Sum all the block reward sizes:
50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + ... = 100
Multiply the two:
210,000 * 100 = 21 million.

Here in the UK, when you explain to cops anything about bitcoin they assume drug related lol. You got your seed so you will be fine

I like it, it follows a similar pattern on Bitcoinwisdom so there is a lot of potential. Also its better for faster payments as the bitcoin network can take about 20 mins for 2 confirmations

I would advise a Trezor but to be honest any hardware/paper wallets have very good security.

Even if Greece does not decide to go full Bitcoin the fact that it is being considered validates crypto currencies and their potential
