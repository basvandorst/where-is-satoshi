I remember quite clearly Charlie Lee warning about the situation, and I also mined BCH at that time because it payed better for a while. That was a different situation though because both chains were still highly profitable. Eventually the BCH difficulty rose to offset the difference and then hash went back to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:16:00
As more and more miners leave the time between blocks will increase. If the price keeps going down more and miners will leave. It could become a death spiral. It is highly flawed technology. It should have been fixed a long time ago, but it wasn't. Many other coins don't have these issues and many of them will survive this Bitcoin Armageddon.

It took a lot less electricity to mine back then. They were just mining with the computer CPU. They could just let it run on in the background. There was no real financial risk in let the miner keep running. Now it takes a lot of electricity to keep these ASIC miners running and that electricity costs a lot of money. Who will keep losing huge amounts of money for an extended period of time? They will just pack it in, and call it a day. Perhaps declare bankruptcy if need be.

Look. I hope you are right. I don't want it to end like this, but the point is that the Bitcoin people had been warned so many times by minds smarter then me that it could happen like that and they never could agree on what to do about it.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:47:39
that's just it. difficulty doesn't adjust in a timely fashion with Bitcoin. do some research about difficulty algorithms.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:09:32
If everyone stops mining the network stops. No more blocks will be produced. The archaic bitcoin difficulty algorithm takes about 2 weeks to adjust difficulty under normal conditions. An extremely unprofitable Bitcoin could take months or years to readjust if the hash rate keeps dropping. It is possible that Bitcoin could just die in its own tracks like a toy robot running out of batteries. This is the achilles heal of Bitcoin, nevermind the 51% attacks.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:50:49
Funny. How many years would it take to process the blocks required to trigger a difficulty adjustment with USB miners?
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:34:24
There are also Democrat Party / Soros connected organized shills out there who’s mission is to talk down Bitcoin and crypto. Weird right? Why are they so interested? Do some research you will see I am right.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:32:44
Yes, that along with the numerous Proof of Stake (POS) based coins, and the many other Proof of Work (POW) coins that have algorithms that support dynamic difficulty adjustments.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:28:17
not really. that would be the last thing on my mind.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:57:37
dude you need to read more. you are not even in the conversation.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:59:14
I stand corrected. I remember playing around with mining at that time, and you refreshed my memory. I did have to use my system GPU to see any meaningful rewards at that time. It wasn’t easy to set up as I recall. You are right though about the GPUs. I am not sure what the economics of the situation was then though, but you say it wasn’t profitable?
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:05:14
But the supply would not be reduced. The production of new coins would be reduced, which has already happened as of now and the price of Bitcoin continues to fall like a rock. Please don't rationalize this. I am getting torched by this just as much as you are. I am not saying that Crypto is dead, rather I am saying that Bitcoin and its exact clones may be dying.
