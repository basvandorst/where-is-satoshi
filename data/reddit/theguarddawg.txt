If you care about bitcoin, you need to write a bad review on the coinbase iOS App Store. We need to warn new users about what they are getting into

A couple reasons:
- Coinbase and their trading platform GDAX have been extremely unreliable lately
- They've introduce bcash, an alt coin, and halted trading at critical moments, screwing a lot of people out of trades trying to sell bcash 
- Recent insider trading scandal
- They've delayed implementing segwit, and thus are contributing to high fees and clogged mempool 
- Failed to batch transactions causing UTXO issue
- Recent incompetence has had many people wondering if they are due for getting hacked

You sir, are a moron. The rating, is ABSOLUTELY, a reflection of the company. 
Bad company = Bad rating

That may be what it's intended for, but not how people interpret it. 
The rating is a signal of trust and reliability for someone new. Clearly coinbase is not either of these things.
If you care about new users to bitcoin not getting screwed, you should give coinbase a bad review to warn others.

No problem, sport

Yes, and when they correct their issues, change leadership, implement segwit, etc.... I will be the first to support them again.
I have high hopes that a little pain from some of their user base leaving will spur them on to greater things. Or maybe an even better, more user friendly service will take their place.
