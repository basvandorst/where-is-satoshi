You pretty much nailed it, assuming you meant bitcoin.org in your original post. 
Bitcoin.com is a Bitcoin Cash website.

For now.  Keep your fingers crossed!

That had the wife and I laughing our asses off.  Bravo! Witty and hilarious.

Yeah, different exchanges have different prices.  Same as always.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:29:56
Thanks to all!

What permissions should I check when linking a GDAX api?
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:24:39
As someone watching from the inside, it REALLY boggles the mind.

Buy only what you are willing to lose.  That being said, I have been putting in 100 or so every paycheck.
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:28:29
Just don't wait too long...
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:44:31
Loled for real at that!
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:05:02
Yippie Kai Yay, Bitcoiners!
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:25:06
I like the way you think!
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:33:02
What a shame.  I hope you helped them get on the proper path!
@_date: 2018-10-30 05:28:06
But where is the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:21:05
Me too...I feel bad for OP though :(
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:23:58
I agree.  I completely understand what the intent was behind this, but some people may not.

He was referencing CZ from Binance. I agree that Binance is most likely to be the top exchange in my mind as well.
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:29:46
My rough estimate is approximately, tree fiddy.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:51:25
Leggo my Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:49:57
Buy a little every week or month. Dollar cost averaging is the way to go.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:47:29
Litecoin halving coming soon...may want to wait.

Gdax is now coinbase pro.
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:03:58
Well you could use Shapeshift and transform your Avacado Coin to the up and coming GUAC Coin. Check their white paper...solid fundamentals.
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:51:50
That chart is using data from 2015. I would like to see what that stats are now in 2019.
@_date: 2018-02-26 04:16:57
If you choose to go with Coinbase, make sure to do all your purchases and trades on GDAX. No fees!
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:07:24
It's got what satoshis crave!

He is the real Shit-oshi.

I've actually visited Serbia,  and can tell you that the food and rent costs are dirt cheap in comparison to the US.  A sack of potatoes costs 50 cents or so that I would have to pay 4-5 USD here in the States.  Even a pack of Marlboros is only 3 USD there, where here it is upwards of 7-8$
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:35:30
Fantastic piece! 
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:22:23
I'm in.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:13:50
BTC is above 9,000....now that is the one I want to see!
