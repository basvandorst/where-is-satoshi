You have 1g of Gold. I will rip it apart now. Why should 1/1000g of Gold be as much as 1g Gold?
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:37:21
Thank you. So how to make a 25$ payment with 100$?
@_date: 2019-09-12 08:45:23
I think it is important to stay open minded -not only in the crypto world- never underestimate your competitors

Would a TX look technically like this then?
I want to send 0.5 BTC but have 1 BTC.
My address sends 0.5 BTC to destination address.
My address sends 0.5 BTC change simultaniously to new generated change adress.
Change address sends 0.5 BTC back to my address.

Thank you very much sir.  I only try to understand the magic behind BTC and how to use it correctly.
But what I cant follow with is" Users have been known to import the private key into software wallet and then spend part of the funds. They mistakenly believe the remaining funds are still on the paper wallet when in reality they are in a change address."

May you all have a nice weekend :) Thank you for explaining me :)
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:16:01
Our reddit friends told us that we cant simply split Bitcoin in a transaction. I have also read that you should only use an address once. So the wallet generates a change address and sends the value. So how do I know the new generated address? One man simply wants to access his remaining BTC.
Sorry english isnt my native tongue. I cant ask simplier.
@_date: 2019-09-12 08:42:36
Have to watch that movie. Heard its good.
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:13:09
Cool. So how are these change addresses generated? Is the wallet generating them or the miners?
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:56:08
Nice watch
@_date: 2019-09-12 06:59:05

@_date: 2019-09-06 17:33:44
Thank you. So how do i know wether I'll get my change back?
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:36:21
Thank you. Can you tell me then how I have to send BTC right? In the App electrum I can fill-in a form with how much BTC I want to send. Where do I fill in the change?
