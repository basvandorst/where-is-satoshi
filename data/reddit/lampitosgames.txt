My problem is that PayPal is how I get 99% of my income.  I like the idea of boycotting, because they charge way to much, but I need the money

I stopped mining because my predicted time to find a block jumped well over 20 years, lol.  It really isn't worth it at that point, and small individuals like myself can't afford massive mining rigs

Okay, I'm sorry, but how could everyone not see this coming from 100 miles away?  Like seriously, MTGox has continually been one of the worst experiences for everyone over it's lifespan (well, butterfly labs was worse, but lets not go there again).  I'm not too surprised to see them tank, it was only a matter of time.

Just a question, if the ONLY place my wallet password (50 random characters) is stored is in a notebook under my bed, am I safe?

If they can't even fucking stop piracy, they sure as hell won't stop bitcoin, lol
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:10:16
This time last year, 1BTC=10USD, lol, that is a huge markup by any standard, no matter what happens

Localtill uses bank of America to get money on your account.  You have to go to your nearest branch, for me that's 200 miles away...

Mind if I (or you) x-post this over to It is probably the biggest and most well-known community of minecraft youtubers.  While this monetization thing isn't affecting minecrafters, a lot of them play other games.  They would love this (bitcoin has been mentioned several times on the weekly mindcrack podcast recorded by the guys), and it is a great idea.

I don't think there is a system that people currently trust, which is the main problem.  People were going to MtGox because it somehow established a base of people saying it is secure, so the rest of the community followed suit even if they had to put up with the problems it comes with.  We need a more central system, implemented into the normal bitcoin server, that would accept bids from people paying in other currency for bitcoin.  The information would be accessible to anybody who wanted to see it, so websites could have a list of current bids.  We would also need some way for the system to accept other currencies, and deliver them to bitcoin sellers (sort of like digital checks/checking accounts).  You wouldn't need to let people access your private information, simply create a new checking account and manually transfer funds from your bank.  I don't know, it seems much better than a privatized system because it would be on the public network.

already have a good gaming card, lol, that is WAYYY better for the types of things that I do, but terrible at mining
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:36:09
I feel there should be an "auction house" type service.  People can put up "selling x amount of bitcoins for x amount of USD (or whatever)".  It would use the same hash system as the bitcoin transfers use today, and the system would hold the bitcoins until somebody paid out via some type of virtual checking account (This could be via whatever, virtual wallets like we have the bitcoin wallets.  Deposit cash from your bank account, and now it can be sent to people over the bitcoin network in exchange for BTC).  Now of course I'm still in coding school and stuff, or I would be working very hard on this, lol.

Codeacademy kickstarted my coding life.  It's been 6 months since I started, and I'm learning java while developing web apps!

It's like mining during the gold rush all over again!

Where do I get bitcoins without a bank account?  It is very hard to find something that is not sketchy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:46:49
As a coding student, and somebody who envisions to start a video game company (not some small indie deal, but something like Valve or Bethesda), I'm fully planning on accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:42:40
doing this for my minecraft server...sadly 11 year olds don't know how to use BTC (sigh)

One thing that stood out to me instantly is the fact you have no ads.  HOW YOU MAKE MONEY?  Not to bash or anything, but I feel that having no ads is not going to make you anything, lol.  I've seen other lotto sites have auction slots for bitcoins to help fund the lotto.  Another thing, it seems that even if you bet the minimum amount, you will get the same chance in the payout as the guy who bets, say for example, 100btc, lol.  It should be weighted so that the more you bet, the more chance you have of winning.  Also, when it rolled for a winner, it scared the f*ck out of me XD, that's just me though, love the animation.  It could use some CSS magic to touch up here and there, but other than that it looks good! :) -Lampitos

just FYI, it is SUPER easy to copy the HTML from any support email, and then just mass send it to everyone you can.  In addition to that, if you are using an smtp server that supports it, the "from" address can be anything that is properly formatted.  So I could send you an email from support or administration etc.  It's really screwed up, but that is how it works.  It is called phishing in the hacking world, and it is evil XD
Good hackers will send you emails that, without looking at the source code, cannot be differentiated from the actual admins of a website.  Be careful people!  As a general rule, most websites will never ask you for your password directly.  I would also recommend setting up account verification (through your phone or something) because it makes it far harder for the attacker to hit you.  The email was sent to millions of people, and he will target the ones without verification, not you.  Hope that helps, lol
EDIT :: Also, you can have a link that looks like it goes to a site.  For instance, the HTML &lt;a href="thisisavirus.free/freeipad/virus/keylogger"&gt;paypal.com/account/support&lt;/a&gt;, would look like a link to paypal, but in reality take you to the virus website *sigh*.  Phishing is a very evil, black-hat thing to do.  Don't do it kids

the petition is very irrelevant, bitcoin has many positive uses as well.  It's good because it is anonymous, and I doubt there are many "hackers" using it, and by the quotations I mean the modern-society view of nerds sitting in a room stealing tons of money from a bank evil villain style.  Also, it only has 2 signatures, lol

damn, and I just bought a GPU!
well thats 250 bucks I'll never get back

don't worry about a damn thing.  In the long run, I believe that bitcoin will be well up over 10k.  People were all "No way it will go over 100" back when it was going for 5 bucks.  Then people were like "No way it will be over 1000" back when it was going for 150 bucks.  Sure you may loose some trades, and win some trades, but as long as you got a couple bitcoins, your net worth is going to go up.
