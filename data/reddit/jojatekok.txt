I am Jojatekok, coder of the open-source projects [Poloniex API .NET]( and [MintPal API .NET]( I have been working on cryptocurrency-related C# projects for over a year, so I have gathered a lot of experience throughout that time. I also have a trading platform application in progress - if you are interested enough to get some screenshots, feel free to request them privately!
My other projects include [Monero Client .NET]( and [PoloniBox]( which utilizes the functions of the API written by my own.
Please PM me if you are interested, as I would gladly help you in API development and function integration.

What if a store owner accepts the deal, but starts using a wallet other than *thisApp? In that case, the debt cannot be returned anymore.

Bitcoin-based banks are possible to invent, but FIAT currencies with all the advantages of cryptocurrencies are impossible to be made.

Contributed some Hungarian strings, hopefully it will be appreciated, and people will help translating :)

I'm proud to be Hungarian when I see posts like that :)

Awesome, I hope that the team will keep up the race with other platforms, and will offer a Poloniex-like trading interface which presents the order list, graphs, and the trading interface at the same time. (There could be a separate dialog/page for creating advanced offers.)
I would also be happy if levarage and shorting was available on the new platform.
