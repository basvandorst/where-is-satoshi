I am trying to understand how to possibly block NY IPs.  From protocol level, anyone (including NY residents) can send Bitcoin to my addresses.  Anyone using my wallet or service could send Bitcoin to NY residents.  There seems to be no way to block that.

I would be very happy if it only applies to Shangri-la (other than it is really unfair to Shangri-la).  That's it, we should propose them to make that change.

Do you plan to block New York State users in light of BitLicense?  
Ironically, New York is going to make China sounds a bit more friendly to bitcoin startups.

I need to find out good ways to block out New York State users effectively.  
If I just give user a banner that said, you are not allowed to use the service if you are from New York, is that enough?

Could we propose this change to BitLicense?  BitLicense only applies to Bitcoin business phsically registered in New York State.  It does not apply to businesses registered outside of New York State.  I think this will solve a lot of problems of BitLicense.
Posting in several threads to raise awareness.
At the very least, it will keep the businesses inside US, just not in NY.  That is an improvement over the current BitLicense draft.

I am trying to find some good ways to block out State of New York users without requiring identity verification from every other users.  Please help.  
If fact, from protocol level, there is no way to block State of New York users.  Users from New York State could send Bitcoin to my Bitcoin address.  There is no way to stop it.  If they send Bitcoin to my address, I am screwed.

But if our service is not a website?  Or it is a service that attaches itself to another system, like Changetip on Reddit.  
Thanks, I understand you are trying to answer my question earnestly.

Could we propose this change to BitLicense?  BitLicense only applies to Bitcoin business physically operating in New York State.  It does not apply to businesses operating outside of New York State.

I think this is an important point to note.  Bitcoin is a protocol, not a website.  A website can block IP, a protocol cannot and **should not** block anyone.  
Many Bitcoin business are not websites, they may be wallet, protocol, or something else.

I wouldn't mind block out NY customers if that is even doable.  However, I am still trying to find ways to do it.  I don't know how that is possible.  From the protocol level, someone from NY could send Bitcoin to my address.  There is nothing on the protocol to block that.  Same thing for the sending side.  There is no way to block someone sending a NY user Bitcoin.

This is getting worse and worse.  Any suggestions on how to block New York State users?

I mean being a registered New York business.
