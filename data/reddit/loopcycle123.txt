Too bad they don't sell lambos in that store.

I think it's just a correction. It has been on a long run and people still need fiat to buy things. It will take a while to rise again. Hopefully it won't take long. And rise again. 
But I don't like to talk like people who says " it will go to moon hodl hodl hodl " 
Sell when price goes too much, buy when it's low. That's my attitude

Wow so I there is a place that I can buy my lambo at last.. lol
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:47:51
Yeah. And it's not going to give you real signals. Just like the all women 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:18:05
Oh right. I forgot about this news. Isn't it going to give us some arbitrage opportunity? 
After all the bots have been set, price will be pumped again

Any rational explanation about your analysis? I'm not really knowledgeable about technical analysis.

Stock market and bitcoin are completely different things. In stock market, you look for a company that makes profit with their services (at least this is what you should be doing according to "intelligent investor by Benjamin graham"
Bitcoin is a new way of payment method. Like they used gold instead of paper in the past. 
A lot of people make money on the cryptos but it is like buying euro with usd dollars and selling euro to usd and make profit. 
What I think Wall Street guys are wanting is I think, they want the bitcoin to be controlled by an institute and not to be worried about real people. So that way, they are just need to care about what this institute says (federal reserve bank for US).
This whole bitcoin thing is really hard for these rich asses because they didn't care about free movement of the money before and it makes it really hard for them to gain money from bitcoin. 
However in the future, they can't just ignore bitcoin and have to take it to consideration before their moves, and this is where they are really scared about. More hard work, and less manipulation power over the money(currently fiat). 
I think the bitcoin is like Robin Hood. Takes from the power from the riches and giving it to the poor. 
Most big companies are unable to invest because they have lots of money. But when the power of the bitcoin increases, a lot more investments will take place. It would be better for the US. 
There are stock exchanges in the world based on US DOLLARS, euro etc. maybe we will have a stock exchange based on the bitcoin and we will have companies that their main currency is bitcoin

Check out Binance. I use it personally. 
Also I would recommend technical analysis if you are into some mathematics. I like bollinger bands and momentum. 
Also you can learn a lot from  
It has a nice technical analysis tool.

They can put service providers to jail. Like they did when they declared to end "gold standard" in 1933. That time whomever bought gold was put in the jail. So yes they can do it if they decide bitcoin is uncontrollable and powerful. Right now it's just partially uncontrollable 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:28:47
Search for "ending of the gold standard" in wiki. They can do the same. Results would be the same for the bitcoin as happened to gold and gold hodlers at that time

I was hoping he wasn't able to spend it, and just forgets it. In the next few years if btc price skyrockets, it will be great for him. And if the price falls down, well it's already forgotten.

What do you think is a real alternative?
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:34:55
No, I just think that fees should not be that high. That's all. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:18:59
It means Not everyone is as poor as us..
