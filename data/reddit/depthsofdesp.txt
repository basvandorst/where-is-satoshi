so..  you kinda just agreed it has no value but 'at least it can be used to keep track of transactions until ee settle debts in fiat' 
and only among trusting parties so... literally as good as a Google doc but with transactions taking forever and requiring software installed for that purpose. 
wow cool.

Sir, being a digital notebook isn't value.

What you don't seem to get is that it's the buyer that sets the price.
If someone wants to buy btc at more than 0, the value isn't 0, if someone want a sock for 5k then at that moment the sock is worth 5k.
However if no one wants to buy btc at more than 0, the value is 0, if no one wants to buy a 5k sock, the value is 0 (assuming I refuse any lower offers) 
No one buys it off you? then it's worthless. doesn't matter you don't wanna sell, at such point it's not worth your initial investment, it's literally worth 0. (unless wanting to kill yourself looking at it gives you any sentimental value.   but well that's still 0usd)

But I don't agree it's worth 1 cent, if I agreed I'd be a buyer and it would be worth 1 cent but as you know I don't agree cause you have all of them, no rational person would agree in fact  
Can you find a non rational person and scam him? maybe, but of course that doesn't make your shitcoin worth your initial investment or anything for that matter  it just makes you a scammer.

Imagine I went to you with monopoly money and said 'well fudge it's already here, give me your shiz' and then you actually took some monopoly money from me in exchange for actual goods.
Boy aren't you dumb to think I'll ever trade goods back for that monopoly money or anyone would. 
A currency that cannot be melted for other usage (unlike gold and even usd coins) is worth 0.
Better learn that now before you accidentally accept monopoly money thinking it can be further traded. 
tbf even monopoly money has some bottom which is used paper value, btc doesn't even have that. 
And if you think it does I'll sell you a coin named 'bestbtccauseiownall' which I'll go clone from btc. 
I'll give you literally the whole supply for as low as 1000usd.

I have an old, very used sock, it may even have holes, I am the only one holding that sock, I refuse to sell for under 5k usd, the sock's worth is:
1. 5k usd
2. 0
Choose the right answer and you too can understand why what you said doesn't make sense.
(edited to get rid of typos that bothered me too much)

If you own all the coins you have something of no value.
If you owned all usd same would happen. 
No one needs a currency only 1 person holds.
You can certainly see btc value as average of latest or even just single latest transaction, as usually it will reflect it well, but a better outlook is to simply look at the highest unfulfilled buy order currently sitting in the order book, for that's the highest price anyone is willing to pay right now and that's the value.
