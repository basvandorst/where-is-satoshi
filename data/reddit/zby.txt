I cannot find any deposit other than in BTC - but I have made 5 withdrawals into the USD account and only once by mistake to the PLN account.
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:11:36
What you are describing is criminal. I don't think it is worth exploring too much - because if they are criminal then they could do anything with the funds - and we'd have no way to stop them.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:06:25
It is 5 minutes past 16:00 UTC - but USD withdrawals still don't work.
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:49:50
I think they can do that according to their Terms of Service:

That ToS will probably not hold if challenged in court. But maybe in Hong Kong it will.

The withdrawal request is still there - and the bank account in it is the correct one. I even saved a screenshot in case that they change it later.
@_date: 2016-08-12 07:28:32
Today it is still 65K in these addresses - so this might have slowed down.
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:31:40
Looks handy for all the Bitfinex clients.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:16:52
OK - so the transfer got through - unfortunately it was sent to a different account than the one I specified, resulting in another 10% loss on my side. Now support refuses to deal with this any more. This is unacceptable.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:31:58
I submitted an express withdrawal - will it be done in 1 day as advertised? Obviously I am getting that 'on hold' message, because I was forced to change password and 2fa - but since I am paying for express - then I expect it to be done in express.
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:26:55
I think that the audit action should be really initiated by the creditors - i.e. holders of the bfx tokens. Obviously we would have to organize somehow.
The trading of the tokens now when we have no real information about the books and also buy out offers is kind of silly.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:12:30
This is a private company. At the very basic this offer might be attractive only to someone whose stake in the company would justify all the control activities needed - like checking the books, going to Hong Kong to be present at the meetings etc. Also being a minority shareholder in a company like this with all those intricacies of jurisdiction etc is not very attractive in general.
@_date: 2016-04-05 08:37:35
This would be a good story for journalists to pickup. Any break up from the current side trend will be accelerated by that and can lead to a nice rally. Add to that the Greece rumours again.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:47:19
Am I the only one to find this tasteless?
@_date: 2015-06-29 08:40:10
I.e. race conditions will bite your ass!
If you let them.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:22:11
The Japanese exchanges with big volumes have zero fees - these numbers are meaningless.
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:36:50
That volume comes mostly from two exchanges bitFlyer and Quoine both with zero fees. This number does not mean anything.
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:20:51
Well - this might be perfectly standard way to conduct business in China - but would you now transfer your funds there?
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:43:56
Money is always speculation - this is what makes it money. You don't hold money because their intrinsic value - but because you speculate that you'll later exchange it for something with value.
@_date: 2017-02-13 12:23:06
I sometimes think that the PBoC actions are already priced in and we are ready for another bull run - but this kind of posts reminds me how naive people are.
@_date: 2016-03-07 11:37:55
Shitstorm on the internet? Impossible! There must be conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-02-13 12:31:58
My guess is that they make a 'register' of BTC wallets - and it will be only allowed to move bitcoins between them. This is very easy to watch over - because everything is visible on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-04 09:39:27
If it is in % it is not linear - it is exponential. 50% growth means you multiply the amount by 1.5 every time - i.e. the function is 1.5 to the power of x.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:30:18
You guys should really promote it in LTC. They are much closer to adopting it (they need only 75%)- and if LTC suceeds with SegWit then BTC will follow.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:36:16
I don't think they'll confiscate them or something. But They can just make it more profitable to mine on their tree.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:38:49
Well - that is the point, if it turns the tide in that case then it would be a great example for other cryptos. And there are good chances that if SegWit is activated in LTC then it will get a lot of publicity now.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:41:15
Promote SegWit in LTC! LTC is close to adopting it, and it is also much smaller than BTC - so it will be much easier to push it. Then it will be a great example and BTC will follow.
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:57:21
Actually it is the receiver who is in danger - not the sender.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:30:57
Apparently it is now 25% which is lower than the BTC. That was a surprise for me - as I remember them starting quickly. The F2Pool is stalled: 
But they have also a lower threshold 75% versus the 95% of BTC. The higher percentages are hard to reach - you need to convince practically everyone.
@_date: 2016-01-04 12:28:12
Do you have any source for that info?
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:23:38
They will be probably goxed, but not by the exchanges - but by the government. The more time passes without withdrawals the more probable is the variant China creating some kind of China BTC with forced registration of wallets and where all Chinese wallets will be only allowed to transfer BTC into another registered Chinese wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:23:43
I have heard LTC is quite close to activate SegWit - if that suceeds - then it would be a great example and BTC should follow quickly.
@_date: 2016-06-08 07:03:26
Yes - soon we'll have two bubbles and then all reserves of a major exchange will be used to buy a lot of frappuccinos.
Be prepared!
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:15:14
I can explain it - when traders lose money they would think up anything to show that they are still good traders. ;)
@_date: 2016-06-06 07:48:59
Baron Munchausen would approve this idea!
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:49:18
This graph is posted on and on since 2011. If people upvote this it means there are many new comers. I guess this is bullish.
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:31:27
I would call it bear shit.
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:51:33
I guess this warning is aimed at officials using public funds to play the speculation game.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:26:37
Yeah - I am buying - but you know - it is now a 27% correction, there is a saying about catching knives.
@_date: 2016-02-02 11:44:33
Forks should be normal for Bitcoin - otherwise I don't see how it can still be called decentralized.
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:27:26
Last year I was attacked with a very targeted and sophisticated attack. I switched everything to 2FA with the key generator on an android phone disconnected from the network (and without a sim card). I don't have access to anything via my mobile. I also switched my desktop to QubesOS.
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:21:39
They will not ban mining - they'll make them register the farms and their block rewards. Then they'll let them sell their earned BTC only on registered exchanges. The goal is to stop the possible capital controls leaks.
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:07:10
OK - I stand corrected. Nevertheless if miners are not shut - then they'll be regulated in a way to make it impossible to leak capital abroad with the mined BTC.
@_date: 2015-09-10 10:21:21
Can someone change the title? They do the same thing they planned but in a different way.
And by the way - how is the effect of this? Have been any of these addresses emptied? What was the effect on the network?
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:44:36
Why exclude those from 2010?
And those who learned in 2009: 
But yeah - I did not buy until early 2011.
@_date: 2016-05-05 10:20:36
So you cannot talk about your plans before you start your work?
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:51:31
If he had this kind of information then shouldn't he get the site off-line immediately?
@_date: 2016-05-06 08:45:03
I think you are mistaking bitcoin for some kind of religion.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:30:53
How can you be so sure that:
*  Satoshi did not confide some of the keys to someone.
*  That nobody cracked a Satoshi key (because for example Satoshi had some fault in his RNG, or by using brute force, or just by luck)
*  That someone hasn't found an unencrypted drive (or encrypted not enough) thrown away by Satoshi.
*  That someone hasn't hacked Satoshi computer.
Now - the stakes are pretty high for this game - so this someone could very well be for example NSA - don't they have resources for that?
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:08:02
I think someone is really confused here.
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:53:39
Making hashing faster means only temporary gain - it makes mining more profitable and soon more miners add more mining machines and than the difficulty will be adjusted.
One block per 10 minutes - no matter how fast you can hash one block.
@_date: 2017-07-09 12:22:11
So these changes don't make any difference in regard of scaling.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:59:08
How about proof of stake coins and PPC in particular?
