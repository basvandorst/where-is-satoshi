"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."—Philip K. Dick
A corollary: "Shared reality is that, when everyone stops believing in it, does go away."

We thought he's not greedy. He's just greedy in the future. You'll see. You'll all see.

This is a great point that highlights the trade off: if you allow frozen, unspendable coins even if you have the private key, then all bitcoins now have a new unspendable risk built into them. So let's say you have a million dollars worth of BTC; however with a freeze system maybe it ought to be discounted  by X% because of the new freeze risk. Instead of a few people having their coins stolen, everyone's coins would be depreciated. That doesn't sound very deflationary to me. 
I say keep bitcoins fungible; don't introduce this extra risk and complexity.

This looks great. I'm a big fan of your articles and NBitcoin. Look forward to digging into this.

The websites for the [planck]( and the [atomic]( have more information. I'm not sure they really explain the keyboards or the ortholinear philosophy. I built a planck for myself just recently. It takes a little getting used to but I've been able to switch between it and a staggered keyboard without issue.

This is such a great insight! I really love it. One minor quibble:
You can, nay, must be able to take them to the future because we take ours to the future with us everyday. You just have to keep your private key secret.

We've all been worried about double spends and crypto with bitcoin, but if bitcoin can't survive a hostile fork, then we're already doomed.  We just didn't even see that problem coming. Hostile forking of cryptocurrencies is a NEW PROBLEM. The solution can't be "DON'T DO IT." If that worked, that would be our solution to the double spending problem: Don't do it. People are going to do what's in their best interests. Bitcoin knitted those interests together to prevent double spending, but it remains to be seen whether it can be collectively governed.

Rising fees change nothing about bitcoin's current maximum theoretical transaction through put: seven transactions per second.  I don't mind fees, but fees don't buy you any more transaction capacity, and they incentivize miners to keep that capacity low.


I believe if we wait till fees rise, it'll be harder to increase the blocksize.  It'll be a short term gain for miners to have increased fees, but a possibly damning long term loss for bitcoin users.
This to me is an optimization issue: Are we to explore or exploit?  Are we to grow or settle?  Either we exploit the current bitcoin users for fees, or we prepare for vastly more bitcoin users and transactions and see where bitcoin can go.
