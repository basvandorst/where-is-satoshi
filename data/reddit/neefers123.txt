If you play eSports or online games it’s quite easy to understand. Anyone better than you is cheating or hacking, anyone worse is a noob.
Same works for bitcoin. If it’s better than fiat and gold, it must be a scam, fraud, bubble... etc
People just don’t understand it. So rather than trying to understand it, they just bash it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:51:54
Remember that someone somewhere is using bitcoin because their government failed them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:42:25
Will try! I'd rather try to do the transaction without going to fiat. I'd feel better about purchasing it WITH btc.

I’m still on the counterstrike haha. 12 years and counting.....

Bittrex for Canada works, fund account with btc from coinbase. If you want to sell go with quadrigacx, it’s a vancouver exchange. Bittrex was the easiest and most user friendly for me being Canadian, I’m happy with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:04:22
This is exactly what is going to happen

I was carving brisket for a banquet and accidentally asked the client “can I interest you in a piece of bitcoin”...... 
Yeah. I’m serious.

Muggle. 
Works for the bitcoin wizard. I’m a wizard, I hodl magical internet money. They are muggles.

It still seems a little bit early for this panic, we’re still a week out. IMO just a fud campaign to drop the price so people can buy at a low. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:25:18
It’s just an article on motley fool saying gbtc will crumble after futures. People freaking out as usual.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:49:47
because i want to use it as its intended form of a currency?
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:19:53
I messed up and panic sold my GBTC ���� one bad day and I made a mistake. Which was my first ever after starting investing, made a small profit but missed a huge opportunity. Lessons learned in there, and added a huge page to my journal about that day and what went through my head and the lessons! 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:26:33
I've just reached my 1st whole yesterday too! Gonna make myself a bitcoin cake or something!
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:40:57
I'll 2nd this, I've never had to wait longer than an hour.

EXPECTO BITCOINUS! *insert Harry Potter meme*
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:58:07
I'm still not confident in splitting my coins held in breadwallet. So currently I'm just holding. Will dump BCH when I feel confident that I won't mess it up and lose it all. Waiting for a few more guides, then I'll dump BCH regardless of price.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:33:24
This show is better than stranger things. Fuck me! This was worth the investment, just watching this unfold is epic!

Someone needs to turn this into one of those stuffed animals they make from your children’s fridge art. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:09:08
Sigh. You are so right
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:28:43
Done it too, don’t worry. I lost like .25. Hodl ��

Dude my bittrex is showing the most wack prices right now
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:28:24
Alright alright, you got me. Deleted it. Good day sir.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:25:59
I’ve always been a good saver, but after bitcoin I just realize how much bullshit is out there to just take your money. I consume way less now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:31:56
So you’d rather me invest my money in a bank and take 1% per year. 
No thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:31:03
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:42:14
I'm gonna be honest with you, don't. It's not easy. You become your own enemy. if I'd held, I'd be better off than trading. However, I made wins, and losses, but if I had just held I would be up a few hundred more than I'm at. (Didn't lose much, just a little dignity accepting defeat, that's all.) 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:57:08
If you didn't sell above 3500, you might as well just hodl at this point. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:02:32

@_date: 2017-09-11 05:05:04

Announce 20 trillion dollar debt, call bitcoin fraud.... smoke &amp; mirrors to me. Just another time to buy more btc
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:47:54
I’m not with BMO, however, just for you, I’ll go there and try to open an account, only to ask them if they allow crypto purchases. Once they say no, I will tell them I’ll take my business elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:11:32
I would actually donate bitcoin to NASA if it was available

i wish my IRL friends got into bitcoin soon. I JUST WANT TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT IT!
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:05:40
I wish I knew people that had a mine, I really wish I could learn how to do this. Fascinating. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:22:28
ive seen a few bitcoin stickers around downtown, ive been thinking of adding a few myself :P 
we should get a bitcoin group going somewhere! 
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:49:39
I still dont understand bitcoin completely, its very difficult to grasp the entire concept. But it has not stopped me about promoting it, and encouraging others to take the time to read about it. Its actually became quite fun to get people involved in it, it really makes me want to learn more. Especially being a millennial, ALOT of us believe that fiat will fail. I already know that the current fiat system will not make it until my retirement, its bound to crash and burn. I just tell my friends that bitcoin might be the way out, and for the cost of an avacado a day, or starbucks, or a damn fidget spinner, might save them in the end. 
Someone needs to get on making a documentary about bitcoin on netflix. Target the millennial's! We can change the system. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:31:57
Agreed! HODL! I will shit my pants when were on the moon.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:56:11
I must join in...... promote Vancouver! 
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:31:15
This is exactly how I hodl.
Want a nice fancy dinner?! Nah I'll cook and bitcoin the rest. New razed keyboard? Nah I'll buy a 25$ one and bitcoin the rest. Case of beer? Nah that could be bitcoins. 
It all adds up.
