Not sure why they should be able to do a coin grab just because it is an old account. Seems like a fishy law. Some people do long term investments lasting over 5 years. And arbitrarily moving coins around adds more points of contact and lessens security. Weird law. Hope it doesn't pass.
Your idea is good though if the user could set a time frame before a payout went to someone else they had chosen and this law wasn't in place. Secondary payment is good in cases of death. I think it should be added to many things including game clients so can pass down your steam library to your kid if you died.
They could easily work around it with a setting that bounces coins between two addresses on a set timer as an option for users if they were so inclined.

I had to sell at 310 btc at $13.59 when I knew a spike was coming to pay for neurosurgery. I could have bought a house.

I see lots of back and forth debating about the ethics of selling drugs, weapons, etc. I think all of this is besides the point when you realize he tried to hire hit men, if in fact he is guilty of that. It think it also means he deserves no support from any community. I think that pretty much eclipses the points being debated.

So all his illegal actions are okay but someone attempting a different illegal action of blackmail is not okay in this grey area of the ethical realm? If selling weapons for likely illegal purposes is okay and blackmail is not in your mind where exactly is the line drawn of okay illegal actions versus not okay illegal actions? Surely if all of his actions are okay then doesn't that say that ethically blackmail isn't much different than selling weapons in black market for likely murder usages? Not defending blackmail but it falls in the same area morally as the weapon sales I think. Not against weapon sales really but in that market there was definitely a lean towards them being used for nefarious purposes hence people seeking to buy them anonymously to avoid charges when they use them on someone. So in your mind murder over money is okay but not blackmail? Just trying to figure out where this line is drawn and how this is supposed to be something that the world agrees on? Honestly asking, not trying to be insulting at all. I'd like to understand your logic.

Definitely but if I had waited a few more months things in my life would be much different. Just identified with this pic over it for sure.

I find this to be a completely different issue than the situation I presented to you to figure out the logic to your argument but accept some of this to be true separately but still find that I wouldn't pin myself to Ulbricht as some hero here or any sort of example. Not about bootlicking rather having some logic over who I would go to bat for philosophically. I'm for these things you mention in response (freedom, not needing govt in our lives, with some exception though) but not for the guy hiring hit men.

Honestly happy with how it's going after having been in on a first pre-order that I got but had to RMA a time or two and the next pre-order not stoked with the wait but since coming back from receivership they have been on top of both completing my RMA I had about halfway through when they went into it and also coming back with a pretty damn good solution to make up for the wait and the price fluctuations since then. They are giving me 4 700 GHash/sec miners instead of 1 600 GHash/sec miner. It's already shipped after making a choice of a few options on the site and supposed to get here Monday. If all goes as expected the wait is over finally. The receivership seems to have been a good thing.

Refresh the page early in the morning. They usually update amounts when they first come in and there is about an hour window to get in there. Right around 9am their office time is best on the weekday.

This sounds like the best plan to me. I'd support it. As a miner with no plans to support XT I think this is a change I can be okay with.

Some passengers expect friendly banter, others want silence. The driver can do their best to be perceptive but just telling them "I'm not in a mood to chat today. Thanks." And they should get it. You can't expect them to be psychic.

You are incorrect about taxi licenses not requiring training. Where I am it takes 3 days training in a school,  then another half day class elsewhere and two tests. One at both locations. It covers all the hospitals and major hotels and route testing as well as the major thoroughfares that make it easiest to get around by timed lights on one way streets and which ones can get you across main streets. It also includes ADA training with a special trainer sent from the ADA.
Edit: Added ADA training I forgot.

MtGox has lost the confidence of the community. As far as the rollback it was all based on one users claim of being robbed. What if he actually did an illegal transaction and then wished to roll it back recieving both the illegal goods and his bitcoins back? Just a thought but the seller would be unlikely to challenge the claim of theft in a case like that. Rolling back the servers and all trades is a slippery slope situation. They are likely to do this and claim this anytime the market is volatile enough for someone to start crying. All trades should stand and the fool who was robbed should learn a lesson about security. Anyone who was smart enough to be watching the market's volatility and made some money should not be punished for doing so not being involved in any market manipulation. A bunch of people are being fucked over for the sake of this one man's claim. It's ridiculous and combined with the MtGox hack and db release you should just consider them done. Anyone still doing business with them needs to get a clue. They should be out of business effective immediately with a massive withdrawal of funds. This is a not place to trust with your financial anything.
Edit: TL;DR: MtGox may have just assisted a rip off at the expense of a bunch of good traders.

Who cares what that douchebag thinks of bitcoins? After Real and then the Second Life debacle of destroying any value of that game at all and failing to protect the interests of it's users his opinion is of zero value to me. And watching how they pushed a friend of mine out when he was extremely ill and having health issues. They basically told him to quit or they'd fire him and he'd have that on his work history. Rosedale is a top notch douchebag. Also the little thing with the necklaces make the work place seem like a fucking cult from what I hear from several employees/ex-employees.

I have been thinking the same thing for the past few days. The only way this feels right is if it's a coop. Otherwise it's too centralized.

I registered and am having some problems using m0mchil miner. I run the main client on server mode. But when I start m0mchil via batch file I get an error saying it can't find the folder it's in. So I run it from the command prompt and it starts but then gives me the error about not finding a .dll that is there. If I start the main client with an -server amended to the shortcut then it starts and gives me a Problems communcating with the Bitcoin RPC. Anyone got any tips?
