interesting idea to say the least.
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:51:41
Absolutely.  There is no better approach than running your own node.

It's remarkable that after roughly 25 years of the WWW people still click on just about anything without thinking,

Hey Stu, we don't store your currency on the node, nor build manage a wallet or in any way have anything to do with any transactions.  we merely supply the connecting infrastructure. 
The shared nodes use the **Electrum wallet** for the transaction and personal nodes via Node.js,.

We spin up personal nodes which only you have access to, or give you access to the BitCoin network via a shared node.  There is a pricing tab/page front and center and we even let you try it for 30 days (no cc necessary) with absolutely no obligation to go forward once your trial period is over.

No worries.

Check out Blockdaemon.com and go to the marketplace tab to see all the protocols we offer

Great advice.

In fact, as of 15 minutes ago all of our Bitcoin mainet and testnet shared nodes are free and will stay that way as long as you want to use them.

That's a little harsh. While you may have spare computers laying around and the technical skills to build, host and maintain your own node, not everyone does or wants to spend the time to learn how to diy.

Oh, and btw, Stu,  Shared BC nodes will soon become free of charge.   The mechanics of which are being worked on right now.
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:19:12
It's personal I that only you have access to the node. Your node has its own unique address, and its own unique connection and authentication key. These are not reused, and ensure that your node is not open and exposed to anyone on the internet.

[Personal nodes are available now]( 
And shared nodes are going to be free (in a few days)

I wouldn't walk around on the street with dollar bills hanging out of my pockets, either.
