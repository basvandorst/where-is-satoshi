Sorry to tell you, but users will go to an altcoin if bitcoin doesn't serve their wishes.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:42:38


You're kidding yourself. This is caused by the mining algorithm not block size. Actually, chinese miners tend to have bad internet. So this will lead to decentralization.


Actually, yes. Since 2009 the speed of the internet has more than quadrupled. So you can do block size x4 easily. A 5 year old understands this. Maybe you are only 4. Do your parents know that you are using the internet?

You can buy bitcoins in other currencies. Even gold.
@_date: 2014-09-05 17:10:33
Wrong. Bitcoin days is actually sum(amount*days_inactive). So if you make a 100 trades of 1 day old coins, it counts as the same as 1 trade with coins that are 100 days old. (With old I mean inactive.) If people are storing a lot of their money in cold storage (which a lot of people do these days), the bitcoin days destroyed will be low. There is no good chart to measure bitcoin adoption, because you don't know if a transaction happened between a merchant and a customer or just between two wallets of the same person.  
The best way is to look at the amount of merchants that accept it or the total turnover it generates.
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:02:00
Of course it doesn't. People just don't expect that they can use it to pay with it in real life. It first has to break through for online payments before it will be used in a physical shop.

@_date: 2014-09-08 11:26:08
1. Bitcoin is still in beta. You have to give it time.  
2. The price is kind of irrelevant, because bitcoin is a payment system in the first place.  
3. People don't need to understand it. Who understands electronic payments? It just has to be useful and easy to use. Bitcoin is still not all that easy to use.  
4. There will always be people that will hold bitcoin (like me), no matter what. (Unless they find a devastating bug in the protocol.)

Things that are wrong in this article:


The author has no idea how the bitcoin protocol works, still he writes a full article about it.


Not necessary. People can spend other things, like euros or dollars and use bitcoin as a payment system, by rebuying the spent bitcoins with euros/dollars. The author acts like bitcoin will be the only currency around.


So the stock market is also a scam?


Euhm. How much stores and exchanges accept bitcoin? Ofcourse, in 2011 this wasn't much the case.


What? Seriously?


Obvious reasons? It's because of fractional reserve banking, which is impossible with bitcoin.


Again. No understanding about the bitcoin protocol.
He ends with: "although I'm not a cryptologist." which explains everything.
Do. Not. Buy. These.
@_date: 2014-08-31 17:48:58

That's true. For now. My opinion is that processors should offer chargeback. This is not an inherent problem with bitcoin.  
You can trust big companies, because if they screw you, they basically screw themselves.


False. Not if you aren't falling for that. It's like responding to a spam mail. No one does that, right?


False. Transactions are almost instant. Confirmation takes time. But why bother? You buy something on the internet.


Which is very easy if you have an account with Coinbase/Bitstamp/.... Not everyone has a CC. There are only 2 stores that I use that don't accept bitcoin yet. If they do, I'll throw away my CC.

In a 'perfect' free market system, you won't be able to make profits. But ofcourse, there are a lot of variables, like the price of bitcoin and the price of electricity. Unless you buy mass miners and have access to cheep electricity/housing, he will make a loss. So he is a fool.

@_date: 2014-06-20 10:14:05
There are two big problems.  
First of all it is too hard to buy bitcoins. If you want to buy them, you need to either go to an online exchange, send in your id and wait a few weeks. You can also go to an ATM, but the amount of ATMs are limited and they are bound to national laws (which include a lot of privacy invasing measures). Or you can go to localbitcoins, but that is also a big hassle. You should be able to buy bitcoins as you would buy pay &amp; go.  
Another problem I encountered is the fact that there are no applications that eliminate possible volatilty risks while buying things with bitcoin. You should be able to buy things with a scan + confirmation where the application immediately rebuys these bitcoins using API keys from exchanges. It's just an idea.
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:08:04

What a retarded answer. He has no idea how bitcoin works.
If you accept bitcoin, you actually accept fiat. Processors like bitpay immediately convert the bitcoins that people pay with to the fiat of your choise for a small fee. Therefore you as a company doesn't partake in any kind of risk. If you would have done some research you would have known that, but apparently you haven't.
@_date: 2014-07-17 07:53:02
It isn't difficult. The answer is  
n = log2(7000000000/(the amount of people that already have bitcoin)) = log10(7000000000/(the amount of people that already have bitcoin))/log10(2)   
If 1M people already have bitcoin, it is ~ 12.77 times.
@_date: 2014-06-18 10:38:23
Ofcourse it will be higher than 600. That's the current fucking price of bitcoin.

"You can turn gold into a spoon!"  
If this is what determines the value of gold, then gold is in a huge bubble. The 'intrensic' value of gold is like 10% of the current value?  
There is no such thing as intrinsic value. There are intrinsic properties, which may or may not be valuable depending on circumstances. And there is something as perceived value, which is the value based on mutual trust. This is what defines the value of gold and especially the dollar.

I think that his argument is the fact that when a central bank exist, fractional reserve banking can exist, and therefore they can lend you money easier.  
The problem is that you don't need fractional reserve banking to be able to lend someone money. The solution to this is actually stated by himself: "Last week, OKCoin, a China-based Bitcoin exchange announced that they had passed a proof of reserve audit with its reserve ration of 104.86%." Which means that they can lend that 4.86% (in theory).  
Besides the fact that you cannot just 'create' bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:36:31
Yes. And most regulation for cars is unnecessary. Only regulation that can save the lives of others matter. Regulation for eg airbags should be up to the buyer of the car. Now you are forced to pay for airbags. Free market you say?  
There are no risks for others if you use bitcoins, so regulation is very bad. Only exchanges need to be regulated with anti-money laundring rules.

First of all privacy. Your credit card provider sends a lot of personal information about you to the merchant.
Second, you don't have to pay a lot of fees for either holding a credit card or making transactions with that credit card. Some merchants provide reductions for people who pay with bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-09-05 17:27:04
The price of mining is totally irrelevant. The total price of mining = the value of the bitcoins that are created during that period. If the price is higher, the miners will lose money -&gt; less miners. If the price is lower, the miners will earn money -&gt; more miners. This is paid for by creating new bitcoins. So, the people that hold bitcoins have inflation and their bitcoins loose value. The money being 'spend' for mining is actually irrelevant for the money that is invested in the technology/adoptation itself.

Very good post.
Assume that we want as much bitcoin transactions as there are VISA transactions, then we need 714 MiB blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:01:10
My math is correct. Learn to count. It takes 30 seconds to upload a 48 kB block on a 13 kbps connection. 13 kbps * 600 s = 7800 kb = 1 MB


Do you live in the US? That is 64 kB/s.
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:03:10
The only good answer here. For full nodes this isn't a problem. People on this thread can't count apparently.
But the fact a miner has to distribute his block as fast as possible is a potential problem.
But on the other hand, why would a huge mining farm not be able to afford good internet?

@_date: 2015-08-19 12:57:56
Back to my old argument. Why would something as simple as a version number inside the blocks not work? The only danger then comes from the old core devs who can screw over the XT chain by makeing the old core miners release blocks with the same number, right?
@_date: 2015-08-24 00:41:34
The only problem I see with BIP 101 is the fact that the block doubles every 2 years. That would mean that it would grow much faster than the average internet speed. I'd rather see Pieter Wuille's BIP (or something similar) of doubling every 5 years. That would mean that home users can catch up in the long run.

Coinbase soon worth more than bitcoin itself?
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:33:54
You're right. But you explained it in a difficult way imho.
From the bitcoin whitepaper:


The key point is that the WHOLE bitcoin core chain is also a valid XT chain, not individual blocks.
Isn't this problem easy to solve? Can't you just produce a 'genesis' block that is &gt; 1MiB when you start using the fork and force the fork to only accept blocks that are chained behind this genesis block?
You only need one such block since the old core won't produce blocks that are valid for this chain since it won't accept the &gt; 1MiB block.
Of course, this is only necessary if &gt;50% of the miners change back to the old core which won't happen anyway.
Also, the idea of checkpoints is not viable. If &gt;50% of the miners are using the old core, you basically need to checkpoint all new blocks which destroys the whole idea behind bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:04:23
The principle is completely different.
"Difficult to crack" actually means uncrackable in the real world, because you don't have unlimited time.
'Tracing bitcoins' is something completely different. You have to make a connection to a payment that has an identity tied to it.

Rooted phone doesn't mean less security. A part of the security is moved from the hands of the Android OS to the hands of the individual. Any application that receives root privileges can do anything they want. It's up to the end user to decide whether a certain application is safe.
A rooted phone without any application that has root access is as safe as a non rooted phone.

fresh install != full node
I'm right.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:51:25
The argument is that it's not 1 MB **spread out** over 10 minutes, at least not for the miners. They want to send their new block as fast as possible before someone else finds a block with the same hash. So bandwidth **is not** the problem (1.75 GiB/month per connected peer for 10MiB blocks). Speed is the problem. And I have to laugh very hard at the ones that think that this will lead to centralization. The price of electricity for a mining rig dwarfs the price of a good internet connection.
Also, people forget that the increase in block size will be for ALL miners.
@_date: 2015-08-20 03:31:29
Why is the idea of Gavin about broadcasting the tx's instead of whole transactions not implemented yet? Then we have 10 MiB blocks and the whole problem would be solved.

Why don't they just add an absolute under limit by the sipa proposal (or something similar)?
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:02:26
Hold on. Every single block contains a hash of the previous block. So, if you have 2 different chains, then the miners of the old chain would produce blocks that would be invalid for the XT chain. So why is this a problem exactly?

Guys. No one gave the right answer. You don't need to download the whole blockchain to possess the coins. The only reason why you need to download the blockchain is to check your balance (and let the software check your balance). That way you can spend re-spend your coins.
You did the right thing by checking the transaction id. You have received 0.311 btc ("Total Received"). This means that you have your coins whether you download the blockchain or not as long as you don't loose your private key.
If you don't want to wait to download the blockchain, then you may try to export the private key of bitcoin core and make a qr code from it. Then scan it with bitcoin wallet on your smartphone. This may help:

People buying bitcoin will not drive up the price in the long run. Adoption will.
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:25:35
If we are not careful, then the amount of money that is invested in bitcoin startups might be bigger than the total bitcoin money supply :)
@_date: 2015-10-16 20:02:26
This isn't even remotely funny.
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:37:34
Absolutely not. It's fine to have a hobby, but you just don't have to complain that you cannot make money out that hobby. And don't get me wrong, I have great respect for this dude. I use his technology. But he has to involve the community in this project. This cannot be a one man job.

A buttcoiner might say that these countries are imaginary, just like bitcoin. Luckily I'm not a buttcoiner.

You want protection? Why don't you say to your government that you are susceptible to these drugs and let them lock you up. Don't steal our freedom because you are weak.

Ever heard about alcohol?

I smell a contradiction here. Volatility goes down -&gt; more people trust it -&gt; more people invest in it -&gt; market cap goes up -&gt; volatility goes up.

Maybe he should find a real job.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:56:31


Wow. Such arguments. Much intelligence. Many reasoning.
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:37:08


Then what is the point of creating this supply?
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:00:06
True. And passing savings isn't even needed for bitcoin to succeed. It's the easy of use that will make people use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:44:58
People will be paying into anything that gives them advantage, even if it is disadvantageous for the average person.
Remember that everyone acts in their own interest.
Also: BTC will be the great equalizer. If you have money, you can achieve more money because of politics. With bitcoin, this is not the case.

It's odd that people in this sub recognize that there exist hard drives bigger than a few dozen GB.
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:26:18
Hmm. Actually you are wrong about this. How does 'mining equipment' back bitcoin? The hashrate is set by the price, not otherwise.
It's like saying the dollar is backed by physical bank offices.
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:43:12
Have fun with your government knowing exactly where you shop. I'm doing the exact opposite.

The idea won't fail. The idea has already succeeded. Ideas are bullet proof.

What this guys says. There is a lot of misinformation and false predictions spread by these die hard cult members...
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:26:19
Economists are like politicians. They are there to convince everyone, but in essence, they do nothing.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:48:42
Check the link. Where do you think?
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:47:04
But what about the central banks and the Rothschilds?
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:33:08
It's not only about violence. For me it's more about freedom. Do you know how many potential medicines are prohibited?
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:37:42
Euhm... "An exploit allowed 92 billion BTC to be hacked into existence."
I feel like there are multiple things wrong with this sentence.

Lol. Which one is the best?

Maybe someone cured his autism.
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:41:14
How does this have not more points?
@_date: 2016-07-15 22:22:08
Dude. You have to learn to calm ur autism.

Steve Jobs only cared about himself. Maybe you should read up about him 
@_date: 2016-07-19 19:48:39
Some economists actually believe that. They get nobel prices and shit. I guess it's human nature to believe in fairy tales.

Actual generation speed against what? An old block generation time?

Does not affect the market cap of gold.

If it's really 10% then why is it so low? 
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:45:57
What do you mean?
@_date: 2016-07-13 12:28:35
Why do you advertise anyone who endorses slavery? 
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:28:50
I don't really see the analogy, but hey, I like elephants. Have an upvote. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 19:41:42
Block time should have been the lowest possible since the beginning. The idea that long block times provide more security is a fallacy.
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:50:12
He does push for slavery:

I hope you understand that your store on the corner converts your bitcoin to fiat. Which is exactly the same as using one of the 'btc debit cards'.

People that use IE can't be saved anyway.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:58:24
But hashes are taken from the whole block (including the transactions), right?

I have both ETH and ETC on an exchange. If I sell either one, do I loose the other one?

Didn't even know 'savings account' was a verb until this post.

It already exists and it's called prostitution.

The price going down $8 is 'a crash' these days.

I thought the jews were against bitcoin?

This must be some inside joke.

Has this ever happened?
