Ok, I have sent you an ad. Let's see what you can do in terms of traffic! :)

The design do look a bit cheap, but in a way I think it kind of look its role of a discount coupon site/get cheap deals etc.

Please excuse my ignorance, but in the blockchain.info "My Wallet" case - were they tied to using JavaScript or was it a decision taken by the dev team where other languages could have been used?

I talked my friend into participating in bitcoin black friday, but she got no sales from it. Perhaps the product wasn't a good fit, but I was expecting at least a couple, so yeah - perhaps not the smashing success everyone anticipated =/

Seems broken,  goes to GoDaddy and  goes to the old splash page.
The page was up earlier today with offers on the non-www address though so perhaps they are just fixing something.

It is the astrology of modern times =)

"a smart nazi"
So clearly Wernher von Braun was a dumbass according to your standards.

Ah, so they create the seed client-side then?

Yeah no doubt, and her shop only carries one type of very specific product as well so it might not be the best sample. But never the less I thought it would generate at least some extra traffic, I haven't asked how many referrals it generated but don't think it was anything significant. 
There was another shop owner on Reddit who got 20 referrals in total I think, which is virtually nothing.

Nitrogen sports has poker and is an alternative to Seals in case want to mix it up a bit. They allow anon play and very easy to use, can play directly in the web browser.

I think that's how you end up with the imperial measurement system

Please note that this is most likely nothing more than an advertorial, i.e. it's an ad that is in the form of an editorial article.

I think this is a very important distinction to be made. Given the wording on the original seals site together with the fact that we have only heard Micon's side of the story, I would at least be cautious.

Is this the same thing as holding the funds in Bitcoin on the card? (This is a very important aspect to me at least)
@_date: 2015-02-06 10:46:18
It also doesn't seem very secure to download and install a client on your computer for Bitcoin gambling. This opens up for all types of shenanigans.

Financial wise I think they were doing well. But they built their site around a $300 off-the-shelf software so it is not hard to guess that they were having some serious quality issues on the backend side.

Thank you, but that does not answer my question. When I top up the Bitwala card (and others) do you convert everything from BTC to EUR right then or do you convert only at the time of purchase (and only for the purchase amount)?
