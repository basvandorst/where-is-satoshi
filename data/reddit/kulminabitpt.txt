It's actually very good research!
I stumbled upon another medium post with the same graphs/data but bottom was assumed as 6k$ ( 
So the SF is about 1.3, give or take, if you regard the bottom around 3000$/BTC. The same post concluded that Bitcoin was moving 5.1x faster than gold, 30% faster with bottom at 3K.

Problem is they'll start corroding the cryptoworld and just want to profit as much from it as possible. Central banks will adapt too and become more digitalized!
Not saying stop supporting whomever but things can be better if we're a little anarchist inside, open-sourced.

Totally! And even so, we could also argue that mined Bitcoin has some intrinsic value since it took X amount of electricity to obtain.

Yes we are, long long way.
But this says that central banks are, eventually get into trouble trying to tame Bitcoin, right? Banks will centralize further and further and conglomerate because that's how they survive.
Currencies come and go and at different paces. You're not a good keynesian, but that's alright.
If multiple countries inflation starts rising that won't be a single hit in history, but will multiply. that would be a quite a clash, which also makes sense on banks already accumulating. I agree.

-Then your sending that through "email to notify" the company.

I'm in Eu and don't know much about PSD2.. 
But I guess Fintech will have the same (or some?) rights as the bank you have an account with, right?  they'll have to comply to the same rules as they'll share information.
And so, I believe GDPR gives you total possibility to argue and demand some institution that has your data only shares what you specifically allow to. It's not limited to deletion only.
But gdpr is also faulty...
The problem is that it's in the right of the bank/fintech to let you choose, "yes you can use our stuff and we'll keep all your data the you do and sell it", or don't.
And our private data in an immutable public ledger? Nah I'm not sure. 
Unless I could put it in an insurance and get benefited if some company had it leaked or illegally. (?)

Yeah I figured it wouldn't be comparable. By 2025 Bitcoin will have a SF double of gold's!
Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great find and support for the SF model!
I'm just trying to better understand this and trying to find new ideas/assumptions.
Like as you said, the tightening of the marketcap towards the modelling, reminds me that those models of Bitcoin following a power law also suggested a trending approximation towards an equilibrium given enough time. This all seems to apply to the notion of hardest money ever.
But, let's take volatility (high/low price swings) for example. While the decay curves might be closing in, the marketcap as multiple SF will swing inbetween. But marketcap as $$ will be huge and still tend to the SF model, hence a big swing in marketcap will translate in large price swings also??
It's hard to wrap my noggin around this it's what I'm saying!
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:22:25
It can be quite plausible that current price and sentiment are being "hindered down" on purpose. 
Right now it's a race for regulation, some economic actors might want the quickest and loosest legal framework for this space to be compliant for the general public while still hoping that "loose ends" still enable their dubious agenda. Meanwhile legislators still require time to legally accommodate crypto, whilst micro-managing what they're considering a threat for monetary dominance.
Could be why Libra was in such a hurry to fall in good graces. It was an attempt (and still is, in essence a lobby) on pushing for faulty regulation. Let's not forget how this Trump endorsement, 'election-colluding', data privacy issues plays out.
Discrediting that prediction post would be justified if you wanted faith to break, lower prices and lower organic growth in marketcap would favour in most part who has and is able to accumulate more BTC, whale VC firms as such.
In short, it is a tug-of-war of who can better push their influence into their timeframes. Perhaps country states are waiting for 'first blood' being drawn before setting their plans in motion to better leverage the current outcome. 
Right now it feels so, Bitcoin will be 'hushed down'  because a halvening is near, question is until when: are they going to wait for another ATH cycle to end? are they going to capitulate to that?
Maybe the history of Gold can provide some answers?
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:47:01
You haven't found any literature on BTC marketcap equation to compare with?
Also, could you explain why the first segment is e^ e^ (...) ? If that's exponential on exponential then it is bullish AF :)

Awesome insight once again!
Could you address on the validity of this being a  power-law, as opposed to a lognormal trend? Have you tested it for validity?
Many thanks and hope to read more.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:17:52
I don't know what to get from this :/ What's the result if you could apply this on Gold for example?
The market cap seems to adjust from each halvening trying to find its "equilibrium" point at 1x SF multiple, but then what?

"Portuguese national champion has become the first big european football club to accept online payments in cryptocurrency. (BTC, ETH and UTK)

What are the fees for Euro and fiat deposits/withdrawals?
@_date: 2019-04-01 20:42:10
In our lifetime? That's hard to foresee, many factors to consider.
But I would wish, Bitcoin to be more accepted for products and services and preferred over fiat. Volatility is not scary anymore. 
In countries where it would be legal Governments will be harsh on taxation and regulation but lose support trying to control it. 
Where self-regulation of Bitcoin transactions is supported (where Satoshi's views are supported), would like to think Govs will work for you to pay them in Bitcoin, and good services led to better election results. but I just guess, don't really know.

The 2008 crisis was quite alarming, here in the EU per experience. Wouldn't label it as softly as you  but yes it was one more ciclycal recession, not the first and not the last.. It had quite a systemic spread and hit a lot of economies consequently (remember P.I.G.S.?). There were 3 country debt defaults and bailouts, there were lots of privatized companies to also pay those off.
Bailouts in the EU were a heated debate with some EU members not supporting at all, it all came together only to stop dissemination. If Greek society didn't collapse then it was close.
But since these 'symptoms' have cicles it well demonstrates that crisis' magnitude's could be expected to become bigger. We can only argue  on causes, consequences and timing of it.
We agree that Bitcoin is a safeguard if a national currency goes under if so happens as a crisis consequence, hence it's the best store-of-value the common Joe can bet on, instead of hoping for any force-fed solution from their government.
Thing is, Bitcoin has a large learning curve if you want to keep it safe, there's lots of digging and DYOR. 'Trusting' a bank was 'easier' but in Bitcoin you're on your own and still you have to be careful not to be scammed.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:26:46
But you only assumed one value of price for each day correct? You picked the close price on each day for your raw data?
Edit: I guess I was trying to say that, one wouldn't use this if one wants to predict a specific price at a specific time in the short future. As you said highs could be 10x from the model's predicted price model, and lows as 50%.
But I think I understand your point. You can infer a lot of conclusions on the macro scale of Bitcoin.
For example, as you said, the differences from the trend seem natural to be higher for the upside (people want to profit, speculate for higher prices..) than to the downside (relative to trend).
Also, I guess you could also infer that we're going to have bear and bull markets drawing slower across time. And that a bull market will take more and more timespan to conclude, compared than a bear one.

I believe you can add Portugal as well. Holding and usage is not regulated (different than actually being legal, but it's use is not prohibited).
Capital gain taxes are not regulated too, as there is no legal framework that can define what crypto really is, unless (!) it is used such as a commercial/enterprise, professional activity (income could be taxed in function of the exercised activity, not origin of funds), so if you regularly trade and take profits you could be obliged to pay tax (keep in mind that even on this category there is no abiding law - only vinculative information from tax authority).

How would you go to measuring user growth?? There are issues on accounting for wallets/addresses, transactions... It seems to me all direct statistic data is overvalued (as in there is more wallets than real users). Users and daily users numbers are not as easy to access also.
I was wondering if Lorenz curve of wealth distribution would be good start, but only if we assume there will be a more equal distribution once we're dealing with bigger user numbers.
Number of users in Bitcoin is a bitch to deduce, thats for sure.

It could, just like email.
Even if in another country he could be notified by local judicial courts. 
Seems like a genuine notice prior to a regular lawsuit. He should get a lawyer still, to intermediate all the dialogue. Doesn't mean he should give in, as imo there are no grounds for a fundamented reasoning of a 'supposed' direct harmful attack.
That's what egomaniacs do, everyone's out to get them and destroy them and should pay for moral damages. Guess what, you already lost your moral.
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:40:45
So they're thinking more in it as an investment (maybe like una pensión...)?
adoption is slowly building. Already heard taxi drivers and fish truck drivers, in 400ppl villages here, just regular people, como nosotros, that were asking around folk about bitcoin.
Do they have trouble handling technology too? like creating an exchange account etc? Because I still think seniors don't handle smartphones deeply.
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:02:04
Not an expert, but maybe you'll have to differentiate what is a Bitcoin Core node and the network.
My guess would be that the Bitcoin Core github repository is the only (not accounting forks and sorts) code that could be considered to rule the Bitcoin network.
You probably already dug into "Mastering Bitcoin" and "The Bitcoin Standart"

Great job! I love these.
Could you explain why power logs are better than other methods?? I learned some numerical methods years ago (remember very little) such as Euler, Polynomial etc..
Surely there could be other methods that fit closer, no?
Do you have the standard deviations for the price?
94 is a great fit, but results can only be seen as an estimated reference point right?
Another stupid question: Its hard to evaluate from the image, but how well do cycle dips in the model (bottom price) correspond to actual price cycle bottoms? (I mean, checking lowest/highest peaks in the model don't seem to match the actual price time).

Would be cool sure, to see a truly educative, Satoshi-minded ad for so many people to see. however it would require 500k (!) hodlers to down 10$ each. For 30sec.. To spread such a big message in so little time at so much cost would be questionable in efficiency on it's own purpose: to convince why Bitcoin's the real deal.
A community-like initiative would be nice, but free and open-sourced, best ad wins sats competition?
Either way there are more crypto actors that would (and will) gladly pay that to promote their project: Libra, Gemini etc etc. 
Wouldn't more consistent hodlers rise from their own research on BTC after a "first dip" into these kinds of "ramps"?
And the World Cup has bigger audience. ;)

Could someone ELI5 me how these big addresses were found? Transactions and addresses are public on the blockchain yeah, but can you query the Bitcoin blockchain to show addresses with *&gt; x btc* on them? (I mean, of course you can... its all in the chain, but how?) On your own and not rely on bitinfo or blockchain.com data?
I would say Whale watching to be kind of easy wouldn't it? Which would help to predict large price swings maybe? I know about Whale Alerts, but is anyone following the aftermath of those large movements with price swings?

You're welcome. I learned something too.
Keep in mind Bitcoin is about economical self-responsibility, keep your private keys to yourself and as safe as how much money you've got there - Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.
If you're not sure about something there is always someone more experienced here or at r/bitcoinbeginners. Always consolidate the help you get with your own research - DYOR.
You can check the AT's vinc. info here:

As per the new 5th AML EU directive you might have to implement KYC, if it's not explicit for BTM it will probably be so in the future.
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:47:11
Regarding portuguese tax laws, and since you'll be regularly trading fiat/BTC, you'll be required to declare all your income as category B of the IRS (search for the vinculative info from financas.gov.pt - or ask for one specific to your needs).
I would guess (as there isn't any official info on this) that would be safer if you create a specific NIPC/company for this. Similar to when your created your business you'll have to register it with specific CAE's.
Edit: mindthecoin.com operates with CAE 63990 - Outras actividades dos serviços de informação, n.e. They're pretty well established for some years now.
It's a seca, but you'll be a step ahead when regulation is clearer.

CRISPR and Bitcoin are on a par in their respective fields.
We can argue however on their decentralization.
AFAIK CRISPR has much more regulatory control as far as research is concern, I guess.
