How may I get one?

Yeah, the banker never heard of bitcoin. 2014! Anyway, I had to prove I owned it. The bank won't let you borrow money toward a down payment when taking out a mortgage to some extent.

The withdrawal was in the past, my recent purchase was larger. Was just looking for some insight. With Brexit going on I wanted to have more bitcoin on hand for the long run.

I read it. Very comprehensive. Really puts a good perspective on the general direction and ascent. Thanks for sharing!

You're not alone. I have the same thoughts. I also have high hopes many will wake up in time. People are dumb and trustworthy of crooks. Some see through it. Make sure you have survival books!

Maybe ransom ware? Crypto virus... If I had a shit ton of btc you can bet it would be properly backed up.

This is amazing! I'm saving the link for the next version with hologram.

I did my part. Added that the underlying technology could change the world. Oh, and end drug war, promote a hemp industry, and some health related things.

I like to hope that the transition will be long and slow and it will slowly die. All we can do is hope I guess. All I know is that fiat is screw. It's monopoly money and eventually has to all go back in the box to start over.

If it were me and I'd decided to assemble massive mining rigs because I believed in bitcoin's potential and future value and stick with it when the prices were a third of what they are now and I know that basic economics shows scarcity is a potential sure sign of value with increasing demand then why on earth would I quit? Just don't see any real big immediate changes but I think the price will rise more quickly over time.

I think you learned an all important, and expensive, lesson on why we always first perform a backup before making any changes. See if there are any log files for the application, perhaps the address was recorded.

Yes. I can't find anything wrong with a bunch of us who see the fiat scams for what they are and desperately hope we're making a good call on our, and others, futures. Keep it up. Pay day is coming!
