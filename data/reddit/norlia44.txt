That's crypto for me right now. That's sad, because actually I love the thought and the possibilities that cryptocurrencies offer. However, the system is developing in a dangerous direction. In five years' time, people will still be using Paypal, Visa and so on. Thanks to these services I don't care if I pay in Euro, Dollar or Yen. The fees for the conversion are mostly acceptable. Moreover, it is likely that these vendors will adapt blockchains to further reduce their fees.
Bitcoin's goal was to reduce the high transaction costs incurred by a trustworthy third party (read the White Paper if this is new to you). In the meantime, the price of bitcoin and the fees have exploded so much that this core aspect no longer applies.
Today Bitcoin is a speculative object, which owes the increase in value for the most part to the hype and the desire for big profits. Obviously, many people will sell their Bitcoin as soon as they feel they have made a worthwhile profit. That's a problem. They sell Bitcoin. They don't use it. 
We are therefore on our way to a point where a bitcoin becomes too valuable and many people want to exchange their speculative object for real wealth. I am convinced that this point is way ahead of the $ million mark.
That stock markets offer to bet on bitcoin obviously increases the importance of bitcoin in public perception, but reinforces the impression of a speculative object and weakens its role as a currency. But it is not only the financial market that treats Bitcoin like a speculative object. So do we. The HODL mentality is a problem. The last one still writing HODL will be the one who can't throw his speculation object to anyone else and thus has lost the game.
I'm interested in how many of you are here because you believe in cryptocurrencies as a currency substitute and how many of you only speculate on price gains. To those who write HODL: Are you aware that extreme price increases could mean the end of Bticoin? Does that bother you?

**Is Bitcoin a safe market?**
Depends on what you define as a safe market. In any case, Bitcoin is not covered by gold, does not represent a loan to a company or is supported by a government. For these reasons, Bitcoin (in my opinion) is more speculative than all classical forms of investment. 
**What could cause a market crash?**
I recommend the following video rationally explaining possible reasons for a possible bursting of the bubble:
**Can it replace normal currencies?**
In the current implementation: No. Transaction throughput is too low. The transactions are already piling up at high trading volumes. As a result, people have to outbid each other to confirm their transaction. This in turn leads to very high transaction fees. Steam has therefore abolished bitcoin as a means of payment (google it). Whether the network can agree on a practicable adjustment is highly speculative.
