That, and they can have a store of wealth they can use to actually purchase things, which would make it more liquid

would you say that a positive correlation between gold and bitcoin in the upwards direction means people associate bitcoin as a 'safe-haven,' or that folks thinking bitcoin is a 'safe-haven' would cause the positive correlation.  Its kind of a chicken-and-the-egg question.

What about more roundabout ways of getting your BTC into a fiat like exchanging it for a precious commodity (or other mediums of exchange), and then into a fiat?

You have a solid point-BTC will be rendered useless IF governments band together to ban bitcoin exchanges.  People would have imbalances in their accounting books when it comes time to pay taxes.  I could see it, however, working if in such a system you could pay for B2B services and your suppliers with BTC.  A bitcoin-only business would fail though, because they have no fiat cash flow.  A business transaction mix, carefully balanced between fiat and BTC, could work if they saved enough fiat to cover their taxes.
But what on the other hand about alternative exchanges for things other than fiat?  What if you traded your bitcoin for digital gold/silver tokens and then called on the metal, and sold the metal for fiat currency?

If only the download worked! I want to read but SSRN's platform is failing massively

I think what will be more interesting is if it can maintain some sort of steady relationship in either the positive or negative correlation.  More could be drawn from this rather than a zero-correlation.  Let's not to mention the profitable trading opportunities when the correlations of gold and bitcoin flip between +/-

The relationship changes over time.  Currently, the path is negative (-0.18, so close to uncorrelated, but still technically negatively correlated), and should be heading further south given the momentum its gained.

In my analysis here the sample size is is how many days you take into account when calculating the rolling correlation.  30 days is a good sample measure to to take since it corresponds with a month.  How would you have done it differently? 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:25:07
Its possible, I'll come back and update with what happens next month.  I think the analysis might tell a slightly different story if I also had minute-by-minute data for gold (only have minute-level data for cryptos and day-level for gold right now)

Paul, I'll come ride with you!  Bring Bitcoin to your local bike party while you're at it too.
