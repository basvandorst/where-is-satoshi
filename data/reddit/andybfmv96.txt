Why can't we just use BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:39:24
Why did this get downvoted so much?
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:46:08
Hey just one recommendation. Make another page for a price finder. I.e. pick a currency and it will list all the prices for that currency by exchange. Helps a lot when finding the best place to buy and sell.

It's also why he hates mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:26:59
It's especially cheaper sending money over seas this way. That's legal
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:25:36
More like 10

Shush 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:35:31
Lol the downvotes are just pouring in.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:17:59
To real

Are you sure the gif version isn't just 54.27% larger than the video?
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:03:35
DM me if chosen!
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:16:10
I mean as opposed to the 4200+ I've seen I would say it counts. Its also 3989 for me
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:09:46
If that were the point of BTC no one would use it and you wouldn't want it
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:32:57
Just use mycelium at that exchange rate. Or even coinbase, Jesus xD
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:30:31
It just worked again
@_date: 2016-12-20 05:15:50
BTC has gone down about $4 (USD) today. Check again first just in case. Also, coinbase has instant transfers if needed in a pinch.
(Just giving all alternative in case no one donates)
Also, I would recommend posting your address here and asking for a donation. Then confirming when you're given the amount you need so no redundant donations are made.
 Much safer and more likely to get a response/trust from other users. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:29:08
Regards I guess you may have a point. But I think investors ($1000+) or 1btc probably understand at least what it is. Not necessarily how it works.  
(Edit: clarity in wording)
@_date: 2016-12-22 05:02:11
Honestly I think this too but ignored it due to lack of evidence
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:57:05
He didn't hodl....
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:34:36
How can the number of people who know what Bitcoin is be less than the number of people that have  &gt;1 Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:11:50
Thats a bummer. I mean i could save some and grab a current gen asic, but i assume you mean something like an antminer right?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:39:26
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:16:56
What have you done! We know what happens when you poke it!
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:22:36
Ahh good. Discounts incoming
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:30:36
It started out as a joke but at the same time it sorta works. Bitcoin has done nothing but go up, and the idea is that we should never have to sell. It is a currency all on its own. The main goal is to be able to use it everywhere you can use USD, YEN, or any other currency.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:10:52
Thanks ill keep that in mind
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:49:10

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:50:08
Lol I almost work my roomate up laughing
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:32:35
also, what i meant by "i dont care much about profit" is that i didnt mind power-draw. 
I do at least understand that an asic will be more profitable the more it provides, but that doesnt mean one would profit from it. Just that it is making more than the power it is costing to run
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:07:52
Damn. Mad respect for SW2X supporters. I feel more hope for our community. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:18:39
Not really a fight if its one sided
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:40:03
Not with the current transaction fees. But definitely has the potential to be better
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:09:55
Respect to this man for living through the pain

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:15
Hell, if someone sends me 100btc now I'll go set up the surgery to remove it now and post a video on YouTube of me eating it on fine f$&amp;kng china
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:29:04
Yeah I'm from NE. Never knew there was a real difference. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:41:09
Hey guys quick question. What do I do if I don't have any bitcoin and I want to receive a LN payment?
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:46:00
Not the federal government. That's state owned. Some roads are privately owned, and some are owned by towns. Nothing federal.
Its very viable to be owned/paid for by towns and private contracts. 
Wake up

How would you know a passkey is compromised?
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:47:34
"Each bitcoin should be accounted for, taxed and insured"
Good luck with that 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:39:51
Sadly I have to agree with this guy ^
People care more about the btc/USD value and making money rather than decentralized, peer to peer payment systems. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:27:28
Dude it dropped like a few hundred. Not even close to what it rose in the last month
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:22:06
Uhh.. I assumed he wouldn't print his passkey as well. But okay that would do it lol
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:21:46
Correction: 2011-2017 
Good times to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:56:27
Remember, never sell
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:32:48
Don't beat yourself up over it. Its a constant decision not to sell. Every moment it drops and goes back up. Not just then and now
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:34:23
I see you put the curly braces below your functions..
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:20:23
Can't manage the money well with a paper wallet without storing the public key digitally which is a nono. Only deposit. A trezor/nano would allow you to create more wallets at any time from your master seed as well as move it around without risking your private keys
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:45:49
It's working fine for me
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:02:40
Just don't sell any. Then you're fine aren't you?
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:10:22
Trump did it
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:50:00
BUY BUY BUY!!!
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:46:36
Hmm. This is true. Not a bad idea, although still isn't as safe as a trezor as the private keys are usually on an easily scannable QR
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:14:15
Honestly either of these methods seem like they will work. Only difference is that the hardware wallet would provide the ability to securely manage the money
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:32:19
Yeah t-minus 10 days to Moon time
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:33:53
That would be fine but you have no way of telling if it's been compromised, or seeing your money grow, or anything like that. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:26:30
Why did I watch the whole thing..

Damn. Hard to believe but if that's real, congrats. Please for the love of god don't let it go to your head. Stay modest. Enjoy life, keep working toward your goals, save some for the kids if you ever have any. And make sure they earn it before they get it!
