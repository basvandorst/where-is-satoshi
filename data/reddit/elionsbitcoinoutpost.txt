Think about it this way. If they see that they are accepting Bitcoins, they'll ask what a Bitcoin is. They can then start a discussion and show them how Bitcoin works, or how it helps. 
Think about it this way. You'll consider getting a credit card for places if they show you that it'll give you a discount or something of the like, and the same could apply for Bitcoin.
By using Bitcoin, they can lower the asking price BTC wise on certain items since they won't have to ask extra to cover the fees, and this will attract people that want that discount.

When I talk about community I'm not trying to put every bitcoiner in the same bag. We all have different thoughts on Bitcoin, different ways to look at the same cryptocurrency. Some of us even look beyond the currency aspect into the more philosophical aspects of it.
Humour has so far been a staple of bitcoiners, both for criticism towards other bitcoiners or even towards people outside of Bitcoin, and I think it's a good thing.
The subject of Bitcoin is important, but taking it much too seriously would be detrimental, and it's healthy for Bitcoin's image that people related to it have this sort of good spirit towards even bad events like these
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:10:20

Despite the fact that these hearings are rather one sided (Due to the fact none of them really focus on giving the "No regulation" side a proper chance) I like them.
They inform the public, and more importantly, it informs people with the facts of Bitcoin that do come out from them.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:09:09
I agree, it doesn't. But we understand the medium well enough to know that inescrupulous people WILL do this sort of thing.
In business, you know that some people will "break" rules by finding ways to tippy toe around them, in writing you'll find people who copy by claiming they got inspired by the source afterwards and slipping a reference or two in there, and in journalism... Well, this may ocurr.
Unfortunately, like any other carreer, there will always be people who do things without thinking of the consequences

Totally gay. I mean, it's a total sausage fest. Who else would be interested but gay people? 
In all seriousness though, there are plenty of amazing ladies who are currently in the Bitcoin ecosystem as journalists, entrepeneurs, etc. and either way, someone's sex or orientation should not matter in this sort of situation unless it's context sensitive (Like they speak from the specific point of view of a mother or a lady from a primarily male demographic group for instance)
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:10:44
I'm not claiming they were correct by doing this, far from it, as someone who is studying journalism currently it's mortifying to me someone could just go and do this to someone
But I understand how it can happen. Journalists are very competitive, and some will preffer to make noise than to do their job ethically sometimes.

I think it's about time that people realise that we're in a world that can no longer sustain the culture of "us vs they". We're in a world that is in desperate need of us understanding that it's a "We".

Unfortunately, a lot of people hate how some "less than nice" redditors go out of their way to try and inject Bitcoin into any and all conversations (kind of why Bitcoin was a taboo thing in . It's a shame really because it's basically pinning all Bitcoiners down to a very specific group of people who don't represent all of us.
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:28:16
I disagree. 
Humour attracts people more, usually. And the "wizard" ad shows that the Bitcoin community has the capability to laugh at itself every once in a while.
The normal user of reddit does not go for hard numbers and the like to steer itself, but it goes for some less "hard to understand" things.
If you want to change the ad, don't change it to something too serious.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:46:34
Agreed. The laws will change how people approach Bitcoin, but alas, Bitcoins are needed in places where they will more than likely be used no matter what.

It's not that the question is offensive, so much as it's useless.
Bitcoin is genderless. I could say guys or girls in a post and it would not matter very much. Bitcoin doesn't care about wether you're a man, a woman, straight or gay, or even if you're transgender.
There are some very good examples of women in Bitcoin, particularly Mrs P. Otherwise known as the bitcoin wife (Who I recommend you follow on twitter since she has some pretty cool articles posted every once in a while)
There's also the fact that there have been some gay entrepeuneurs in Bitcoin. The owner of the gun store that started accepting Bitcoin is gay, if I remember correctly, though I've only heard that from others, so I could be wrong.
I'm gay as well, I don't hide it either but my sexuality is not important when it comes to the Bitcoin ecosystem, and I run a small podcast about it every week.
What issues there could be in Bitcoin gender aren't really of bitcoin, but of whoever the situation is refering to.

I am not saying that MtGox is free from fault and mistakes. Far from it, they've had quite a few during their run (Hell, I made an episode of my podcast ABOUT the issues that MtGox has with customer support and their general treatment of clients).
The problem is that several people like to point to MtGox directly for the bad things that ocurr with Bitcoin or like to throw (for lack of better terms at the moment) whatever shit they can at them, when the reality is that there are several factors that affect the price, and as much as we like to say bad things about MtGox (Some that are very much true criticisms that they need to focus on) they are NOT the only bitcoin exchange.

One of the big problems with Bitcoin Journalism, and currently with Bitcoin business in general as well, is the fact that the community is too tightly knit.
We have very few sites that are the "go to" for many. While there are many versions of journalism sites for Bitcoin, several podcasts for all types of alt-currencies and the like, the modum operandi of most users is to go to 3 or 4 sites, at best, and take whatever they say with complete abandon rather than double-check.
This is a *huge* problem.
There's this little index, which admittedly isn't perfect but will serve to illustrate my point, called the [Press Freedom Index]( or PFI for short.
It's used to measure problems of diversity of information, independence of medium, versatility of points of view, etc. It's a good way to measure whether your journalism media is good or bad in your country. Let's take the country where I live, Chile, as a quick example of what would qualify as "problematic" in this system.
Chile has a few major journalism publications. El Sur, El Mercurio, The Clinic, El Mirador (which is online only) and Radio BioBio Chile being some of the most prominent. We also have a few national TV channels: TVN, Canal 13, Mega, Red TV and ChileVision. You may be wondering why I chose those particularly to talk about.
See, that's the thing. These are practically the only ones anyone gives more than five minutes of attention. There are others that exist, and are certainly filling enough of a niche with the public to warrant their continuous publication, however, they will never reach a high enough point to compete with the other ones.
These major publications are also severely (and rather insultingly so) political. Out of the 10 I mentioned above, 8 are what you could call "Right wing" owned, some of them are owned by the same people when you go into analyzing where they obtain their resources, and politicians have had stock, relatives, or complete ownership of them in the past. A quick example of this is former president Sebastian Piñera, who used to own ChileVision but had to sell it off when he entered office, though that didn't really take away the bias the network had for him.
To illustrate the point even further, El Mercurio is part of an enterprise called Mercurio S.A.P, which owns El Mercurio, La Estrella (a more localized paper), El Sur and El Austral, all of which are very popular papers which are read all over the country. They are also, arguably, connected to La Tercera, which is Mercurio's direct competition, so to speak.
The Clinic, which is one of the very few that isn't really that heavily interconnected to "Right Wing" tendencies, is unapologetically Leftist, and is also known mostly for very crass, borderline parody articles which are more about taking away prestige from political figures rather than understanding the problem at hand. Other journals also attempt to follow and fill this category, making a small portion that is contrary, but no less problematic.
All 17+ million chileans go for these news sources, all of which have been shown to collude, share or deny information in tandem, have the same owners and interests or have heavy political connotations that cripple their journalistic integrity over the years. This doesn't mean that all their journalists or all their work is for naught, but it is severely problematic in the long run either way.
Now, let's take this situation into Bitcoin. 
Consider, for a moment, where people obtain their news sources about Bitcoin, and particularly, what the possible connections between all of them are. 
We have about... I'd like to ballpark this and say 5 major publications for Bitcoin, ranging from podcasts to youtubers to proper journalism sites, all of which have been shown to be interconnected in one way or another. Most of them have high stakes in the technology and economy of Bitcoin, thus providing a bias that is odd and yet very clear for even a passive observer. For that matter, the surnames of these people has practically become synonym with Bitcoin in several locations.
We have several which share writers and owners, all of which can also be found, from time to time, at the Bitcoin Foundation, which feels terrifyingly close to El Mercurio S.A.P, which is seen as the big head honcho of journalism down here.
We have a small, but still noticeable amount of journalists, bloggers and podcasters who board the issues of Bitcoin with more humor and parody than there really is any need for, and in many cases are overtly political with their ideals. Much alike what is going on with The Clinic at the moment. 
All of these sites also see themselves in the conundrum of catering, having to go and run ads for similar, if not equal companies to what their competitors have to go for in order to sustain themselves. 
Now, I don't want to go into details, mainly because this post has gone on too long already, and some of you are smart enough to fill in the gaps yourselves. If we take Bitcoin's sphere of journalism by the standards of the PFI, we have a severely problematic system that requires a lot of fixing, and fast.
A full disclosure as well: I am the owner and producer of a small podcast myself, and I always finish the podcast with the same idea: **Research, discuss and share whatever you find about this topic**. Whether you agree with me or not, this is something that you should inform yourself about, and it's even more important given the constant fragility of Bitcoin.

I'd sugguest checking out Bitcoin talk and IRC channels to find the efforts for this. You could also try and follow some of the leads people have already found (A quick search of MtGox or Goxcoins on the subreddit should help you find them easily)
A lot of people are already covering it, but i'm sure many of them would appreciate an extra hand

I want to see this country get better, believe me. But I also know that it's not going to get better anytime soon. Bitcoin is one way in which it might improve. I hope so, at least.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:19:57
I can't confirm that, but if there was a serious editorial around newsweek, the lack of sources would have pushed this story under the counter already untill there was another way to confirm all of this.
Off the record sources are a guide to finding a better source, not a source in itself. For small places or stories you can go ahead and ask 1 or 2 people (Usually the magic number in any case is 3 sources to corroborate things) 
The way that people are reacting right now by putting  or it's derivaties on their twitter is impressive to say the least. This has caused some major backlash

I've talked about this before on the subreddit, but talking about it again won't hurt anyone.
Bitcoin can be a tremendous help for 3rd world countries due to it's decentralization, specially because it makes it easier for people to deal LESS with banks, or even the inflation of their current fiat currency.
The biggest example of this is Argentina, but it can also help greatly in countries like Chile, where people's trust towards banks is declining fast.
There is also, of course, the fact that Bitcoin helps these people buy things online in a much easier fashion. This is specially good considering that Paypal has pretty much left South America on a limbo when it comes to "how to add money to your paypal", with transactions sometimes having so much paperwork or issues to do they are not even worth it.
Lastly, there's the whole "I'm doing it myself" factor. A lot of people are very much into the idea of being their own man, not having to deal with third parties that impose heavy fees or little, annoying ones over the smallest transactions or issues. Bitcoin helps against this.
There's already a good ammount of people that do almost all of their transactions with Bitcoin, so it shows that there are people that trust the idea of crypto-currency. 
This is key too. Bitcoin isn't the only form of crypto-currency, and it won't be the last. Bitcoin is simply the most famous example of this form of currency, and so far it has proven to not only be succesfull, but that it improves on issues we've had in the past before.
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:49:37
Not to mention the fact that many countries think of the US as an "Example to follow", or even depend on them economically.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:05:53
This. The way that other people (sometimes, people they are paying special attention to) is what will set the ideal for the rest.
Think about it this way. When you're in a big group of people, there will usually be one that is rather influential for one or another reason. The way that person reacts is how the rest will follow suit because they believe/like/trust that guy/girl. Same thing applies here.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:56:36
It goes in the same vein as most marketing does. People will listen more intently and will be more inclined to believe certain people, which you should try to get promoting your product as quickly as possible
These sort of people are either 
* **Experts on the matter**, like what you see on OralB commercials
* **Celebrities**, as most people have some degree of respect for them. Look up to them. Or simply like their charm, which is usually what you also need to market something.
You and me, we know that anyone's opinion on this isn't necesarily valid, and we also know that a random redditor could also say something very insightfull on it, but when you want to go on a bigger scale you need to do something like this because you're reaching more people, and you cannot account for all of them applying the same logic 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:08:34

This is why I think exchanges should be held accountable to some more hard ethical standarts. Those 200,000 Bitcoins are the backbone of some people's income, someone's entrepeurship and someone's dream project even.
Unfortunately we're a long way to that yet. Bitcoin's the wild west and everyone thinks they can just go, do some shoddy work and make a very quick buck out of it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:38:41
The question is useless, but that doesn't mean I won't answer to someone who is curious about the matter, obviously.
The reasons are pretty obvious. Bitcoin's explosion started in the occidental part of the world, where for the most part it's the male demographic that has a predominance on the technology environment. There are several reasons as to why it stayed there for a bit before it exploded abroad, a lot of them are also cultural in the regards of technology in certain areas (It's no coincidence for instance that bitcoin is having a hard time adapting in South america and Africa, two areas where technology is not exactly an every day interest for most people)
Most people involved in Bitcoin are men, yes. But there are plenty of excellent and incredibly helpfull people in the Bitcoin community that are not male, or even straight for that matter. That's also because most people who are into Bitcoin will simply not care about your gender or sex, and frankly that's one of the better parts of it. 
Granted, there are still some people in Bitcoin who follow the stereotypes that you are against, however that is the minority (or at least, i'd say so with my currently very limited information).
The problem as to why Bitcoin isn't being adopted faster around the world is a marketing issue, yes, but it has nothing to do with Bitcoin segregating by gender at all, and anyone who tells you differently hasn't done their research properly.
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:18:43

I wouldn't say that we saw it coming, but we knew disaster was going to ocurr. On my podcast I tried to tell people that it would be a good idea to keep funds away from most exchanges since they are always going to be targets.
Unfortunately, not many of us wanted to be outspoken about it as well.
Some of these things are unfortunately only really "things you can see coming" in hindsight, as the real warning signs escape you on day to day interactions.

I've always wondered why Bitcoin hasn't been more promintent in games that allow advertising. Bitcoin can really help out on the gaming market, particularly on solving the problem of how to get digital markets going in the places of the world where Credit Cards are more a nuisance than an assistance (South America being the obvious example)
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:28:41
It's always great to see more Bitcoin related start ups in Chile, though it's also rather worrisome since we're still not in that "tipping point" that Argentina or Brazil see themselves in right now that kind of forced people to move onto alternative currencies like crypto. Still, Chile does have the right environment for Bitcoin to grow. 
Definitely looking forward to testing the exchange out despite my worries.
