Whatever the reason for this, here's something interesting:  
In yesterday's comments smashing the Chinese copy, it was said by Trezor that:  


So, open source standards... or not?  Not? Cool - take 50% of the price then.  
No? That's fine also. Ledger Wallet is actually opensource and still 50% cheaper.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:28:21
It's an outright lie.  There is no technicality.
There are other exchanges in the US who are similarly regulated just like them, and are older. Just because they were funded doesn't mean they were first.

I've found it to be more secure than an offline wallet. Simply because my computer can be hacked, but with blockchain.info I have a 2FA if that should ever happen.  
I know there have been instances of people screaming how they lost their coins on blockchain.info, but in reality most of them were complete dumbasses.
I mean this dude signs up with his email and password on some shady website, then uses the SAME password for his TeamViewer and his blockchain.info account, and leaves his computer open with TeamViewer open and mail open.  
How more stupid than that can you get?  
All the 'hacker' had to do was take a look at the website registrations, and try connecting via TeamViewer to that IP.

**ONLY WITH COINBASE**

Now we're at the point where Coinbase automatically means "Bitcoin". Are you happy now?  
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:47:55
Both of the hacks you posted prove exactly what I was saying: The users are morons.
The first one figured if TOR is anonymous, it's also safe. He didn't gave a single fuck about the fact that TOR nodes act as entry/exit nodes where the traffic can be easily sniffed. He also didn't give a fuck about the fact that it was completely over clear HTTP - Blockchain.info and everyone else openly WARN people of not using Bitcoin over TOR unless they have a .onion address. This is specifically why Blockchain.info is one of the FEW wallets to have a .onion address. But I guess that was too much for him to check, right?  
The second hack: The dude had TeamViewer open. Same password as he uses on various websites. Enough said.  
Really dude, you're shooting yourself in the foot here. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:56:16
Conevenient and not crazy marked-up?
Coinbase and Circle actually DO MARK UP their buy-in price but they do it INCOGNITO - exactly how banks do it &gt; they put their earning into the price of Bitcoin, because they set the price. So you are buying more expensive, selling cheaper, and don't even realize.  
I mean really, did you expect clear-cut fee tables from these institutions which are recruiting more and more former banksters?  
The only place you will see clear fees are honest, small exchanges who want to be as popular as possible but also want to survive.
 - get me coins at a lower fee than that.  
This might not apply to someone who can't do SEPA transfers (which are free, except the UK for some weird reason) but for me that's the cheapest way of getting coins I could find.  
I am 100% sure there are at least 10 exchanges in the U.S which will get you more coins for 100$ than either Coinbase and Circle.

Same here (well didn't buy it but I wanted to get two of them next week). I just placed an order for two Ledger Wallets instead.  
They are 50% cheaper and still manage to keep it open source, fully, not open for review bullshit.  
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:29:38
It's the same in the UK.   
It's robbery and it's down to the bank, although they are forbidden to take that fee.  
Their excuse is that they do not use the Euro so they can do that, but that's bullshit.  
Sweden doesn't use the Euro and any SEPA transfer from a Swedish bank to anywhere in Europe is completely free and uses the Mastercard exchange rate.  
I too can't believe it's written in law and yet they still openly do it. It's pure robbery but nobody is doing anything, yet you get arrested for smoking weed in the confines of your own home. Great society we've built here where banks are always above the law just because they deal with money.

Too late. Disappointed with their licence fiasco. Just ONE single chinese copy that had zero impact on them made them flip their shit and do this?

 -    
Pick one. They are doing KYC, but at least don't have bank ambitions or behaviour, nor are they too big.  
Want more options?  
Just because they are smaller doesn't mean they are illegal or shady. Start low, don't keep your coins in a wallet you have no private key for and you should be good to go.  
Bitcoin started with the small guy. The small guy here is important. Innovation in Bitcoin comes from the small guy.  
Coinbase and Circle rake in millions but do not contribute AT ALL. All they do is spend insane amounts of money on marketing their own ass as a 'first licencesed exchange' which is an outrageous lie.  
BitPay for example also spent their money on marketing. But they marketed Bitcoin first and them second, not just their own ass.  
@_date: 2015-01-29 08:35:09
I did a few hours ago. I find it quite awful really. The interface is really kinda of putting me off. I like the functionality, but they need a designer badly.  
So far, the best looking (and quite fast and good functionality) I found was BitX - this is the kind of gem I was talking about. A very sleek and beautiful wallet. If I had to recommend a wallet to a non-technical friend who I want to get into Bitcoin, this is the wallet I would recommend.  
Still couldn't find any wallet that has anywhere close the features of Blockchain.info, although Mycellium has a few other features that Blockchain.info doesn't.  
Xapo wallet is definitely a looker too. Very nice, quite responsive.  I definitely feel like switching to either Xapo or BitX for daily use.  
I like the looks on Copay, but I don't understand it. Multi-sig and HD wallets is not something that I want, need or like. I prefer a normal wallet and address reuse, BIP038 if possible please, and good change management.  
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:30:55

Which is exactly why you should stop using Circle.  
And Coinbase why we're at it.  
Yes, I'm against KYC/AML and centralized services, such as them.  
Circle actually has the nerve to delay your transaction by 45 minutes.  
Coinbase does off the chain transactions.  
Satoshi created Bitcoin to avoid having to work with companies such as this.  
Go back to your roots.  
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:29:14
For starters, I don't see how it's easier to buy bitcoin than going through 'some shady' service who has been around for 3 times as long as any of them.  
Second: 'Insured' my ass. They are 'insured' if THEY do something wrong. If you get hacked, it's your fault, you get shit. Read the T&amp;C and stop being naive. Nobody will give you money just like that.  
Third: What the fuck does official mean? There have been licencesed exchanges in the US for a long time now. Coinbase just had more marketing money.  
We didn't 'try lawless'. Nobody wants 'law-less'. For fucks sake it's like talking with Lawsky here. Just because the New York stock exchange didn't invest 75$ mil. in my business doesn't mean I'm lawless.  
Darkwallet is as legit as Coinbase for a wallet.

I hate the fact that they all propose Coinbase which is just another PayPal more and more everyday.  
Too  big, with too much leverage on the Bitcoin economy. Especially now, with their announcement. I hope the Winklevoss brothers launch their exchange for some competition.  
Coinbase is becoming too big. It already is. If you care about bitcoin and not just about being comfortable, you'll take that extra five minutes and work with any other services except Coinbase or Circle.

Fuck Coinbase. Fuck everything about it and fuck the fact that the bank that is now Coinbase represents Bitcoin.  
This is your fault. All of your herd mentaility led to this.  
I'm sorry there are no better words coming from me, but Satoshi created Bitcoin for exactly this very reason: to avoid centralized services like the bank that calls itself Coinbase.  
Move your bitcoin out of Coinbase. Stop buying through Coinbase. Stop reporting news about it no matter how much you want it. Stop talking about it.  
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:57:38
Yeah, terrible security because the users are too lazy to check out around the options and decide for themselves whether they want email backups and whether they want more rounds of encryption or not.  
Blockchain.info is a good service. It's open source and free. The problem is with the user. 90% of those complaining that they have been hacked have been complete idiots, like that moron who signs up for to a shady 'earn free bitcoin' website with his TeamViewer password, then leaves his computer open, TeamViewer open, fucking email open and then complains he has been hacked.  
I use Blockchain.info. I might be biased, but I've been using them exclusively for the past 3 years and absolutely never had any issues with them.  
It's true: keep your options open, and all of the ones you listed are equally fine. However, I personally do not like local wallets as they are vulnerable to the device being hacked. I very much prefer a multifactor authentication, but that's just me.  
I recently started going through every single wallet I can find, just to see what are my options. There are some really nice ones for mobiles, there are some really light ones, and there are some really innovative ones.
However, none offers the features that BC.i has been offering for years.  I couldn't care less about how it looks (also, you seem to be a bit ignorant of the fact that you are recommending electrum or mycellium and then talking about terrible UI... since none of those two are known for being very good-looking).  
The only wallet I've seen - although not yet in beta even - that goes above and beyond the looks and more importantly - features - of BC.i is Darkwallet, to which I'll be switching as soon as it prooves stable enough for daily use.  
I'm not advocating cold storage here by the way. That should definitely be down to personal circumstance - and there are a few good options out there.  
Also, what's important for me with BC.i is the fact that it doesn't force a HD wallet in which I have no interest of ever using, neither does it force multisig, which again, I have no interest in using.  I have no use for those two. I use it as a hot wallet. My cold storage somewhere else, and that too isn't either HD or multisig, but BIP038 instead which works better for me.

blockchain.info is one of the oldest and one of the best wallets out there, security wise and feature wise. Anyone telling you otherwise is a dumbass.  
Just because THE DEFAULTS of the wallet were set to something doesn't mean it's unsafe.  
You should at least have the decency to go through the option and decide for yourself how many rounds of encryption you want and whether you want email backups or not.  
The fact that this joker left his computer open, TeamViewer open, email open, used the same password for blockchain.info and TeamViewer AND signed up with that same password on some shady website doesn't make blockchain unsafe. It makes him a retard.  
In other words, the error here is ID-10T.  
Do yourself a favour and stick with blockchain.

Anything that is small - but reviewed, so as not to be accused of recommending shady websites. Just because they are small doesn't mean they are dishonest. We all started with small exchanges.  
Where are you?
I whole heartedly recommend  - but that's just because it's fully featured - more so than any exchange I've seen. However if you aren't interested in trading for a profit, and just in buying Bitcoins, I recommend any exchange that is small.  
For the US:   
For the UK (and further down EU-wide):   
There are over 200+ ways of getting coins - check that page. Go local - as in as close to you as possible. Try finding an exchange that's based within your own country, own state or if you are really lucky, own city.
Certainly not Coinbase nor Circle. They aren't exchanges (well now Coinbase seems to want to be one).  
Small exchanges, small services, the closer to you the better.  If you have the chance to buy local (try Mycellium local traded, it's really nice) then don't be afraid to do it.  You would be surprised how awesome it is.

I completely agree with Greenaddress and quite like it, but I'll stay away from Coinkite like the plague. Here's why:
They openly call themselves a bank.  
They used to (are they still doing this?) ask for up to 1 BTC to release your private key to you.  
They have proprietary POS systems and a 'debit card' which I thank god every  day it never caught on.  
They aren't opensource.  
They aren't free.  Maybe this changed since I heard they are pushing out more physical goods.  
I haven't heard about them supporting any other open-source product out there. It seems to be copy, replicate and sell with them.

People get into Bitcoin the exact same way as everyone on this reddit got into Bitcoin before they existed. Circle is barely 2 months old, Coinbase hasn't been around for that long either.  
There are 100 ways of getting Bitcoin. Exchanges for example - what's the problem with them? Kraken for example is one of the best exchanges, if not the very best. Never had issues, never been down, never been hacked - has the most features and the lowest fees, yet I never see people talking about it here.

There is a way: It's  - I started using it for all my Bitcoin needs (both selling and buying). It's legit, very professional, very simple to use and they actually do have customer service.
I know this sounds like an advertisement but I'm in no way affiliated with them. I just found the service really, really good.
Here's how the interface (in my account) looks like: 
Downsides:  
a) Not instant  
b) You do not decide the amount of Bitcoin you buy but instead choose predetermined amounts.  
The way this works is simple:  
If someone wants Bitcoin, they buy stuff for another person (through this service) and this person instead pays them Bitcoin.  
It's a win-win. How? Well, the person buying Bitcoin can do so with a credit card or a debit card without ever being a record he bought Bitcoin (because he's not, he's buying goods).
The person selling the Bitcoin usually manages to get a 3-4% discount at the expense of the buyer.  
3-4% is nothing, considering Bitcoin fluctuates in value by more than 15% on a normal day. This means you could offer a 5% discount and still be up by 10% at the end of the day.  
I like it, I use it, you should try it.

Can someone please explain to me how Darkwallet works? I tried using it but it's very complicated.
Let's start with this:
Stealth addresses: Are they some sort of internal referencing addresses available only within Darkwallet or can I, for example, copy my stealth address and paste it into any other wallet or service such as Coinbase to send funds directly to that stealth address?
Is this supported natively in the protocol, or can you use them only between Darkwallets?

Here's a thought:  
Because you can turn a profit by investing in a company even if the price remains stable, or goes down.  
Buying Bitcoin directly... not so profitable in the past year. I should know, I bought at 900$.

I do. Daily. There are a lot of people buying through PayPal for example.

I would only require 1 confirmation if there is no fee for the transaction. Otherwise I would not require any confirmation for sums below 500$ or so.

No surprise here. They had a 15% markup plus fees and fees and fees plus KYC/AML plus a shitload of other requirements.  
Nein.

I don't want to hijack your very obvious problem here, but I can't help it:  
It's interesting how people scream "I've been hacked" when they were actually themselves that were hacked, when using another service and:  
screaming "Blockchain.info account hacked!" when they are with Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:49:04
Best one is  - You buy shit for other people and they give you the BTC equivalent. The catch? It's not instant and it involves 5 minutes of work (to buy for and send the order confirmation forward)
@_date: 2015-02-05 08:36:14
Some, like me, specifically use it BECAUSE of that. I hate different addresses with a passion. I have absolutely no care for anonymity - if someone wants to track your ass, he will be able to do so even with address reuse, but just with a little more effort.  
I hope Blockchain.info will never implement forced HD wallets. The day they do, they will definitely lose me as a user.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 07:33:56
He's right. This is why I use them and will continue to do so for a long time. It's the most secure hot wallet one can have specifically because it's a hybrid wallet unlike any others, but trolls be trolls so what can you do...

For life?! LOL. Do expand on this...

I had already went through their process months ago. I also always had the same card. This just came out of the blue. I did almost daily &lt;10-15$ buys.  
Apparently I needed a 'manual review'.  
I told them I stepped into Bitcoin in order to avoid this exact same shit right here: approvals, reviews, blocks, controls and unexpected 'delays' so in other words - I couldn't give a shit about your manual review, close my account.  
[Right guys, right?](
Anyway, it seems I cannot change my address (pressing the change button doesn't save the new address) nor can I remove my linked account (my credit card). Pressing 'Remove' doesn't do anything.  
I figured if they don't delete it, at least I remove my information/change it to something else. Nope. We can't have that, not in this bank Sir, no.

I am. We're working on fixing it. I'm now in the process of trying to get them to fix/accept it again. 4 websites total. I just need a damn ejuice :)
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:52:41
That's also wrong.
Second website on that list:   
Spend 5 minutes picking what I need, go to checkout and bam, no Bitcoin option.  
Why is it even listed on WhereToSpendBitcoins.co.uk I don't know, since it clearly has no Bitcoin paying option, I'm at the checkout right now. Only PayPal or Pick-up and Pay cash.

I use Xapo and they only wanted the KYC info if I wanted to withdraw actual money. Withdrawing my coins out of it required no info whatsoever. I was also introduced to them via an email.  
Plus why the hate on Xapo?  
They have no fees, one of the best interfaces and definitely the best insured cold storage.  
Until they fuck up, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:07:17
Don't have anything to withdraw.

If you would have told this to me yesterday I probably would have told you to feck off...  
But you're right. I've experienced it first hand, right now.  
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:56:33
Yes, that too. Although I've been on their waiting list for 100 years...
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:36:46
Well they just shut it in my face and hit my nose, so I'll scream about it to whomever will listen.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:04:21
Well... I've only been using it for a couple of days myself, and it's the first time I hear of TeleBit and if "GetGems guys" really do always do this then maybe they really are on to something?  
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:07:41
That's where I'm actually headed right now. Mycellium. Trading straight from the app. Fuck it, I'm going back to the roots.  
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:09:31
I hope never.  The biggest reason I'm with them is that they don't force me to use BIP32/HD wallets. I hate that shit.    
I do not need new addresses for each transaction. I do not want a new address for each transaction.  
I want my very own, always the same, bitcoin address.

Try brawker.com too. Used it without flaw.
You only release the coins when the product is shipped to you. Until you willingly press "FINALIZE" the coins do not leave the escrow unless the buyer undoubtedly, 100% proves you have the product in your hands and do not want to release the coins - which is impossible - a phone call to Amazon and they will confirm they have been or were not delivered.

Aaammm... GetGems has a very well integrated Bitcoin wallet. It's as simple as writing "0.001 btc" in chat and bam, you've sent your buddy that amount.  
Plus it's fully encrypted since it also runs on Telegram...   
Plus it's the only app so far that I know of which supports GIFS... so there's that.  
At least give it a try. I'm not in any way affiliated with them, but this app fucking rocks.

The good news is that your post prompted me to start a full node myself (hint: get the un-released, beta version of Bitcoin Core, version 0.10, it downloads everything in under 5-6 hours).  
The bad news is: I'm running it from my home computer (a laptop, lol) so I don't know how long this is going to last, but I'll go as long as I can.  
In the future, I'll get a new laptop and leave this one running 24/7 anyway, but until then, there might be a few interruptions.  
However, a full node is a full node and every bit helps, right?

Those exact three things are the ones I want most. The second one (personal domain) is in the works and should be up and running soon. At least that's what they say in the coming soon page.  
I'm sure they'll add 2FA and image blocking along the way also. If they don't... well I guess I was wrong about them :).
So far so good though. Loving it.

My identity check didn't fail. Stop trying to put this shit on me.
I verified with them and went through the process and gave them ID scans and everything months ago. I have since then used it daily, absolutely no problems - this was something out of the blue.
This is not about a failed ID check. See the attached photos. This is about a fucked up system which we're trying to get rid of - and somehow - we still managed to incorporate it into Bitcoin.  
I got into Bitcoin exactly to get rid of... well basically, your entire first paragraph.  
I'm a criminal if I don't tell them even what I had for breakfast this morning?  
I don't know man, maybe it's something you're used to putting up with in the U.S, but as an European citizen I won't put up with these invasive questions, not even with a bank, much less with a fucking website pretending to be a bank.

WOW! This is awesome!


malware from the Equation group?
All the malware we have collected so far is designed to work on Microsoft’s
Windows operating system. However, there are signs that non-Windows malware
does exist. For instance, one of the sinkholed C&amp;C domains is currently receiving
connections from a large pool of victims in China that appear to be Mac OS X
computers (based on the user-agent).
The malware callbacks are consistent with the DOUBLEFANTASY schema, which
normally injects into the system browser (for instance, Internet Explorer on
The callbacks for the suspected Mac OS X versions have the following user
•	 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/536.26.17
(KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0.2 Safari/536.26.17
•	 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101
•	 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_3) AppleWebKit/536.28.10
(KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0.3 Safari/536.28.10
This leads us to believe that a Mac OS X version of DOUBLEFANTASY also exists.
Additionally, we observed that one of the malicious forum injections, in the form
of a PHP script, takes special precautions to show a different type of HTML code to
Apple iPhone visitors. Unlike other cases, such as visitors from Jordan, which does
not get targeted, iPhone visitors are redirected to the exploit server, suggesting the
ability to infect iPhones as well.

Why no donation accepted by playstore?
Easy way to fix this: Release another IDENTICAL app that costs 5$... in case you want to donate to Mycellium and this is the only way basically.
Of course... you can't donate with Bitcoin anymore which is kind of ironic and stupid in the same time.
