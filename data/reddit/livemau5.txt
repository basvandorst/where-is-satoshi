No, keep selling so I can buy it at $5k and reap the benefits when it inevitably shoots back up to the moon.

I'm curious too. I imagine that I need a wallet app that uses NFC?

VPNs are more like $5/mo, and you should already be using one anyway, so...

Well first a lightning network needs to be implemented in order to prevent another fiasco where fees shoot through the roof and a simple transaction takes all day to process. Once we've solved the fee and transaction time issue, the next step is for major retailers to start accepting it. 
Finally — although optionally — an ASIC resistant coin needs to overtake Bitcoin in order to put the power back into the peoples' hands. The whole point of Bitcoin was to have a decentralized currency that the big banks and wealthy elite can't control, but mining BTC has become so difficult now, that the only ones who *can* afford dedicated ASIC mining hardware so happen to be those very same people. 
In the good old days anyone with a graphics card could mine Bitcoin. So now you have these so-called "ASIC resistant" coins popping up left and right (like Vertcoin) that can still be GPU mined, trying to become what Bitcoin was originally supposed to be. Honestly I hope one of them *does* eventually surpass Bitcoin, but at this point I'll be happy just to see just about *any* crypto get mainstream acceptance.

Overstock accepts bitcoin?
