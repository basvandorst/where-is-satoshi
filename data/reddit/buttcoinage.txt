I actually chose that name because I was cynical at first and wanted to push the price down so I could get in. True story.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:33:22
I don't trust it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:36:51
That's what Coinbase was saying, but I don't believe it. I've had it much, much faster with traditional banks, and now they are saying 7-10 business days. That's bs. They are doing some shady shit.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:44:34
Is that possible?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:31:24
yes, but 7-10 calendar days is a lie.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:37:38
That could collapse. :/
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:30:32
yes. I started with Coinbase, and gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:00:27
Um, isn't there a myriad of better cryptocoin out there now?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:00:02
What happens when bitcoin is not popular?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:29:15
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:34:48
it is but there are big fees, and serious limitations.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:28:56
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:33:51
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:30:18
No thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:01:57
so bitcoin isn't?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:34:32
I get the international appeal. This is one thing I deeply understand. However, it's not going to work in the long run. We need a UN to step in a back this. And protect these people, and everyone from runnaway infaltion.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:49:13
Any suggestions? Maybe something government-backed, faster?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:44:22
What about criminalize or fine?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:09
better come up with some freaking awesome memes then, and come up with a way to grow back your ballsacks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:17:11
I am even more nervous now that I have.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:36:54
is that enough?
@_date: 2018-09-08 01:16:28
How will government be funded if they lose control of money?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:34:05
at what volumes?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:29:43
Is it good to simply reward savers? How is that good for the whole?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:03:50
where do you suggest?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:28:39
Has it helped Japan?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:37:40
I feel like you guys would like to think that, but I think it's the opposite right now. The banks are much faster in my experience than these exchanges I'm trying to get on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:02:37
I know about that, however, there are severe limitations even on Gdax, and the exchange is at a premium to others per coin. Is there another exchange that is safe that you suggest?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:59:12
Has BTC been widely adopted?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:14:26
Isn't that scary, that you could log in and all your coins are gone?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:01:27
Ethereum is merely gas for mining the many alts. I just don't see monetary value in it all unless we have maybe a UN backing a coin, or governments. And deflation is bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:02:47
it's taking a really long time
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:32:55
It just feels the same, if not worse? It seems like a lot of speculation on what it could be. The deflationary aspect sounds good, but there's so many altcoins popping up. I'm struggling with this and don't want to be a bag holder at these levels. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:30:39
I feel sorry for the bag holders.
@_date: 2018-09-08 01:41:31
How can they track it if it's peer to peer?
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:58:08
Still that's old school. There's a new school in town
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:47:07
I love this iconic picture
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:11:02
It is not an ideological. It is idioelogical to think that if I give my money to Banks and other companies to use that I should get some sort of return
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:42:28
Old school
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:34:32
I don't like debt
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:47:07
I'm speculating I will be able to buy things with it as Square and other merchants start adopting it, and covert it to alternative cyrpto for purchases of things if necessary
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:23:23
Got it thanks. I'll just hodl and never sell. This never have to pay taxes or buy that toilet paper fiat stuff again
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:16:26
That's all very scary to me as well. How are your average mom and pops going to adopt this tech when it's setup this way? It seems much simpler and safer to have your funds in a bank account.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:08:51
It's simply a better instrument, it's merely a matter of time, not luck, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:05:38
I'm looking for government's and patriotic borders to recede. Also for LN or a high layer to be used for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:45:59
That's like right when asinine Jamie Dimon said it was horseshit. Then I really wanted to start buying. Unfortunately i couldn't get meaningfully invested until I listened to Adreas and understood it more and went through the hopes of unfettering myself from the current monetary system. Fuck all that and those old wigs playing with my money.
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:13:20
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:43:14
Fiat cash...any currency 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:28:58
In fact, I'm buying!
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:26:44
woohoo on sale. Almost to my goal! 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:02:24
Why is Bitcoin Cash forking? Sounds like a money grab and major dilution to me
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:41:01
Often in many transactions you don't see the input screen
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:44:58
Looks like the reversal is happening. And it's a reversal, and new beta? Look at stocks going down and crypto going up.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:45:20
You ever go to a restaurant, and the waiter takes your card?
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:40:13
What if you can't see it. The screen isn't visible etc?
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:38:55
I was thinking also the reputation of the merchant. It's not about growing up. How do you know what they are inputing if you don't see the screen of the register 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:42:27
No that's good. Which wallet? It seems this needs to be an essential aspect of any wallet
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:01:50
talking about in last hours and market open here in the USA.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:23:43
Um I do, and get out there and start using it! No excuses
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:40:47
Stop using excuses
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:41:13
ask if the merchant takes it. If they do. Use it
