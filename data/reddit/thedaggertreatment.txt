I'm not a bitcoin scientist by any means but I think is inferring that politics *should* be useless in bitcoin, but it obviously holds some power if you consider the current political mess in bitcoin.

Bro just use BTCmarkets. Way better than independent reserve.

Pray tell, what is your motivation for running a node? (Genuinely interested)

Haha I think competency is subjective. Here it's sincerity that matters more. My partner always gets frustrated but I just finds that tires me out haha.

Lulz bro have you been to India? I would call it "a ridiculous oversight yet typical of most things in India"
The first week it was outrage. The second week mildly annoyed. This week I think we've all just given up and realized that the banking administration is just as fucked as every other kind of admin here in India, i.e. everyone is just getting on with life despite not having any cash available.

I hear ya. Looks like I'm sticking with pen and paper then. Maybe I'll put it inside an airtight container under my Rottweiler's bed!

Ooh I like your style. 
What would you say are the disadvantages or potential risks, apart from your trusted persons going rogue or their security being compromised?
@_date: 2016-10-23 22:53:41
That is badass. Thanks very much for the comprehensive write up!
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:19:24
Roger that, thank you

Awesome, your perspective has really helped me figure out what I want/need in my wallet security. Only just clicked as to who you are. Love your work. Thanks mate

So you split the passphrase and send to different portions to multiple locations? Or are they duplicates of the same passphrase in case one location burned down or something?

No judgement here bro it's just an honest question: are you at all concerned that someone might get unauthorized access to those bits of paper? 
I can imagine in the future that a burglar will know exactly what to do if he opens a drawer (or safe) and finds a laminated piece of paper with a seed phrase on it. In 1950 a thief wouldn't have cared about finding a plastic card with a bunch of numbers in your wallet, but by 1960 the bad guys knew exactly how to use a credit card...
I use pen and paper myself, but I feel like digital storage is the answer and I really want to find a secure solution for my mnemonic.

Haha, nice. But do you stash considerable amounts of Bitcoin on your mobile wallet?
I'm really impressed with Airbitz and love using it but if it's such a bombproof system then why are so many people still cold storage maximalists? Not disagreeing with your method, just interested. In fact Airbitz and JAXX would be top of the pile so far in my search for a digital solution to private key security. 
I wonder if we'll look back in five years and say "wow I can't believe we used to secure our wealth on bits of paper..."

Wow cheers that is beautiful! However, not digital, and therefore can be accessed by an unauthorized person in the same way as a laminated piece of paper. Basically: whoever holds your cryptosteel holds your private keys

Lol, touché bro. However, three sides to every story as they say.

Why detestable? The dude gets raided black ops style by USA government thugs on his farm in sleepy New Zealand (my mate lives on the same rural road), for nothing other than finding a loophole in the fat cats system that provides an epic free service for the average Joe.
He's one of us bro.
