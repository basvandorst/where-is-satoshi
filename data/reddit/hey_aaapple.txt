Until there's no working proof of concept, it's not a solution

It encourages risky behaviour and allows some weird scams to be set up

Considering that miners can't pay electricity in bitcoins, they are quite helpful

And in fact hoarding cash is a terrible idea long term. Investments exist for a reason after all.

That's not as easy as spending a couple hundred bucks per day to do something that's 100% legal

And we fall into conspiratard territory.
All evidence that does not support the viewpoint can be described as "skewed", "manipulated", and "untrustworthy", while the opposite is true for the evidence supporting it.

There might be a chance. First thing first make a backup of all the content of the SD card somewhere safe, and double check everything was copied correctly.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:25:50
Going full conspiratard already?
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:31:01
Did you run the math? Because even assuming fixed hashpower (which is blatantly false) and no failure (which is ridiculous) you could simply never mine more than the initial cost.
Say you mine 10 before the first halving and the next, you will never mine more than 10 after that because 5+2,5+1,25+... converges to 10 for infinite terms.

Come to join the dark side
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:13:17
Nope it ia not guaranteed because halvings.

If a single bank, lat alone a single nation, wanted to stop bitcon they could do so for pocket change (some 10k/day) simply by spamming high fee transactions. Even less if they copied the malleability attack.
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:35:51
So now you guys are r/conspiracy v2.0? 
A single dude slowed the whole network to a halt with the malleability attack, if banks were really trying to destroy you they would do the same if not far worse, not a couple vids.

It's not improved for what, 7 years? And the theoretical limits of blockchains systems aren't really looking good
@_date: 2016-02-08 10:08:10
Mass adoption any day now
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:54:34
You forgot the /s
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:25:08
Wut? I said that the users are going to be pissed, not that they will blame something specific. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 18:51:01


I know. But the possibility is there. Anyone COULD review the code. Yes, they might not do that, they might miss glaring flaws, but with cloaed source the possibility doesn't even exist
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:47:05
But at least with open source you can tell it's fucked up.
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:15:27
The end users don't care about who is at fault, they care about their money being easy to use

Micropayments got so many chances, and we can see how well they did every single time. Spoilers: they sucked hard.
