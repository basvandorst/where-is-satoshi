They're going to ask you for a device I'd which you wont have.

When is the ledger wallet android app slated to be released?
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:03:55
Won't work.
@_date: 2015-12-05 03:55:31
Nope, you're wrong. They're one of the very few people interested in "bitcoin as a protocol" and are the only ones who've successfully implemented it in an MVP: the 21BC.
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:53:59
Mt. Gox with very few bitcoins in hold
@_date: 2015-12-01 08:55:36
Sounds good. Any particular features? And can you kindly include message signing and address labeling?
@_date: 2015-12-15 06:58:44
I remember seeing 5% for BTC withdrawals and ~10% or so for USD withdrawals. That's when I started hating changetip and stopped using it frequently. Now that its 1%, I'm all right with it.

Is this where decentralised exchanges are better?
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:23:45
This is what instills faith and trust in bitcoin, when a bank discusses and guides the public on how to use it.
@_date: 2015-08-09 16:38:03
Perfect explanation in 1 sentence.
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:25:51
Love the design. Functionality is pretty basic(though useful)
Are you interested in creating web apps relating to this? PM me

Why don't they compensate Roger Ver for the bitcoin.com fiasco first?
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:33:33
Have you read about the OKCoin fiasco? If not, please do.
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:15:46
Price is at a low :p
Is the hashrate inversely proportional to price? Lol, just kidding
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:08:39
These guys have been quite creepy and highly doubted upon. I'm sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:51:48
Lol....was BitLicense created to "regulate" bitcoin in  NY or to indirectly remove the exchanges/services dealing with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-24 05:30:55
Coinbase as a 'bitcoin wallet' is pretty absurd. Coinbase has its own ecosystem of services.
Mixpanel, digital ocean, taboola and upwork will definitely get to 1 billion valuation.
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:32:13
Lol, the article says bitcoin has gone mainstream. Seriously?
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:59:25
This time the media hasn't made the mistake of calling Karpeles "Bitcoin's CEO" :p
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:35:13
I'm using Copay and its quite straightforward and clean(which is exactly what I want).
OP: buy a hardware wallet now.
@_date: 2015-08-08 04:47:06
This is what the media should cover. Not lame crap on "Bitcoin's CEO arrested" which misleads everyone.
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:38:36
Wow such relevance :p
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:12:14
That's quite innovative and feasible.
@_date: 2015-08-09 02:48:51
I have a slight feeling that what you said is partially true. It is also possible that most of the startups/companies will move out of the US.
@_date: 2015-08-03 09:14:44
That massive spike in January 2014 :P Goxxxed!
@_date: 2015-08-09 16:33:01
+1 the post was quite funny but still conveyed what they primarily wanted to.
@_date: 2015-08-09 02:27:34
You should apply for BitLicense. Hopefully, after that the printer will work fine.
@_date: 2015-08-24 05:32:52
When they raised $75 million, I think they were valued at $400 million. So they are halfway through.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:49:53
That's not the solution, the solution is to make sure anyone can encrypt their data. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 01:03:03
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:47:04
That is if you're expecting a constant flow of BTC. Moreover, you don't always have to buy a trezor. Ledger offers a cheap solution(right around $17 i guess) provided you set it up on a safe host. I obviously didn't mention "trezor". 
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:38:49
100x better than the current design lol. Great job though a few minor changes will make it better. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 07:02:20
Quite good. I was thinking of making one myself. I'll print a wallet using your design soon :D
@_date: 2015-08-09 02:49:55
Woah....that's awesome progress.
@_date: 2015-08-22 06:55:55
This was a nice read. People should cover these type of attributes revolving around bitcoin rather than silk road and Mt.gox
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:53:52
Why did BitGold receive $1 million+ in funding? You're partly right but not completely.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:44:33
Well, to be honest. $100k is too overrated. I understand the OKCoin fiasco but the current design is not at all up to the mark. Also, I heard the site was on blogger(though they have migrated to WordPress now)
I suggest you spend $2k-$10k more to actually give it a good design. I have seen a few people charge $4k-$12k for complete designs and they've worked for highly reputed entities.
If you need any help, let me know (free help)
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:51:34
Why dont you share your experience?
@_date: 2015-08-28 02:00:29
I don't think this is new, I've seen this website maybe a month back. They really need to change. A theme from theme forest would look a hundred times better.
@_date: 2015-08-21 08:51:29
Yeah. That's pretty commendable. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:42:06
Next, someone from kaspersky?
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:40:53
Lol. I don't think that is allowed now. Wasn't there an issue with preloaded physical coins?
@_date: 2015-09-13 09:09:27
This seems to be a good idea. I'll try to get something done soon.
@_date: 2015-09-13 15:20:54
I have a coder who can probably do it. Shoot me a PM with your Skype. We'll discuss?
@_date: 2015-09-12 08:06:05
Surprisingly, it happens to be the wallet with the highest number of users.
@_date: 2015-09-27 09:13:02
This might be offtopic, but I thoroughly agree with your views regarding the pricing of KeepKey. What a horrible way to do business, take an open source project and make pretty much the same device, (closed source hardware) and sell it for $140 more.
@_date: 2015-09-27 13:11:37
Well, my trezor arrived in less than a week and as of now, I'd rather stick to it since KeepKey doesn't have any unique features. Once they implement something useful, I might have a look. Until then, its a cheap clone.
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:33:46
Exactly. 21 Inc actually has an excellent vision which is disruptive, both from a business model point of view as well as creating new economies and IoT
@_date: 2015-09-24 05:02:42
Because publishers need to make money. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 04:47:27
Yes, if it doesnt cost a bomb, I'll pay for it.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:45:08
An impressive comparison :p
These guys haven't even written the code (minor enhancements, changes,display drivers etc)
And now, theyre asking $239!
Besides trezor has a $10 shipping. I don't see why the "free shipping" shines.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:12:26
That's a great list of benefits. I'm sure it will be beneficial to OP. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:39:24
Personally, this is not justifiable. These guys are taking an open source project(trezor), making a few changes(larger screen, mnemonic display structure etc) and selling it for $140 more than the trezor. Their hardware schematics are not available freely.
I was pretty sure that the price would be comparatively lower than the trezor when KeepKey was first announced. 
I don't think this will be adopted by bitcoiners. The trezor does a fantastic job and the ledger nano is equally good in terms of the price point.
Bottom line: $239 is very high. There are no valuable additions for the extra $140 as compared to the trezor. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 05:00:37
Awesome. I really wanted to use Copay with my ledger.
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:43:37
Awesome. I've been on the beta for a few weeks now and I must say, the ledger and coinapult additions are splendid.
@_date: 2015-09-13 09:07:30
At least they have proper regulatory approvals unlike coinbase who branded their exchange as the first legally regulated exchange.
@_date: 2015-09-27 09:20:43
I can probably get you a copy if you review it for a website I'm running.
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:47:51
This news was reported on the finovate blog more than a week ago.
@_date: 2015-09-02 06:54:10
Pretty good I'd say, now more people will actually believe in bitcoin and not ask "isn't it a scam?"
@_date: 2015-09-27 14:02:00
That's exactly what I'm trying say. Apart from the large screen, KeepKey has nothing new and I doubt it has all the trezor features such as OTG and stuff. Yet, its priced $140 higher. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:47:43
Wow, that's amazing. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 09:09:46
@_date: 2015-10-06 07:24:35
@_date: 2015-10-21 02:34:29
Because you need to setup the ledger in a safe environment.
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:25:15
Awesome, I was hoping that they'd accept bitcoin sometime soon.
@_date: 2015-10-06 07:16:53
If you're a writer, you should probably consider writing on bitcoin/crypto/blockchain tech.

Not really. Thy people over there just don't understand bitcoin. They are quite weird though. Some guy talks about volatility and other guy says, "why use bitcoin when eventually you'll convert it to fiat"
I think there is a strong need to build a detailed, no bs, easy to understand yet highly informative guide for bitcoin which will serve as a bridge to crypto currency for newbies.
@_date: 2015-10-06 15:51:59
@_date: 2015-10-18 17:56:45
Not really. Right now, KeepKey doesn't offer anything unique apart from a larger screen. On the other hand the trezor is $140 cheaper.
That being said, it will be interesting to see what KeepKey rolls out in the near future.
Ledger is extremely affordable but make sure you buy the ledger starter along with your ledger wallet.
