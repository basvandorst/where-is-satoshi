No that's basically it.  People have been using exchanges to buy and sell crypto for years, and since it is vaguely anonymous, many have likely avoided paying taxes. People may not have even "cashed out" but instead just had coins in wallets they then spent somehow.
It boils down to "but muh crypto/anarcho/tax is theft/anonymous" people being upset they never set aside money for taxes.

Its as anonymous as you make it. People can link together transactions to prove it was the same person/wallet.  But your *identity* is still hidden unless you expose enough of yourself for people to catch on.

Using a third world nation that has had manipulation from outside sources for decades is not a perfect example.  Almost every other country that is functioning relatively stable is a counterpoint to your one single example.

Logical and profitable is a confirmation bias.
1. You will never be able to maximize your buy/sells. It's impossible without insider trading(at a minimum)
2. Your timing in buying/selling your inevitable non-maximized trades will never truly be with full confidence.  One bad trade and *poof*

You are so full of koolaid you are oozing it through your pores.

Sure. But those two arent equal.
The *potential* is there, possibly.  But its been what, 6 years of potential and "to the moon" screaming.

Every coin did. I was looking at the charts and just going... Wtf happened this morning.

Because this was when bitcoin was comparatively worthless.

Because unless you can tell the future, you can't guarantee you will sell high and buy low.  And the effort to do so without losing your entire fortune isn't worth it to many people.

I dont understand how you can get free money.  If I buy 1btc, and then sell it later at the same value, I will still come out ahead with "free coins"?

As long as you are capable of admitting you were wrong too. There are a lot of moons in everyone's eyes, and while its been a good year, no one knows for certain where this is going.

Thanks for the link. Its sounds like for users it is a win in the short-term. After watching some of that link I see where the complications arise

Your case will get thrown out before you can even start to say "I'm sueing you".
