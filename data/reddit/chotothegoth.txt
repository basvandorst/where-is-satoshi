mcafee only looks after himself. most of the time he just shills some random coin to make its price explode, then sells what he owns leaving his fans with the baggage.

$51m right now. or if done a month ago would be $73m. Should just say 3813 bitcoins, instead of the dollar value since it's so volatile.

why thou? if bitcoin does crash to 1k or sub 1k then it will be pretty much in free fall till it's near worthless. Bitcoin only has priced value since other people think it does, if it crashes then a lot of people will be burned and the believed value of bitcoin will be pretty low. It's not like what happened 2-3 years ago, since back then bitcoin wasn't as well known.

only thing bitcoin had going for it was that it came first
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:31:48
only reason bitcoin was so dominant in the past was because it came first, but pretty much every crypto that came after it is much better than bitcoin is as a cryptocurrency. the novelty is wearing off, bitcoin's problems won't be solved anytime soon, and the lightning network isn't the solution. bitcoins time has come and gone, and the new kids on the block are taking over. this isn't a dip, this is the slow bleed which will kill bitcoin in a couple years time.

the surge already happened when it dropped from 19k-&gt;12k then rose back to 16k. this is a slow bleed till sub 10k.
