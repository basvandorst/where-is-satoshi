But we do know that it was us who scorched the skies...

Do you have any evidence whatsoever that the polls were fraudulent in any way? In fact they were quite accurate- polls the days before the election were well within the margin of error. 
Also LOL at Wikileaks never lying.

What was skewed about the reporting?

Sort of... but thats how probability works. The odds of getting pocket Aces in poker is well below 2%- that doesn't make it impossible, in fact it happens all the time. 
Also when did the Post predict 98%? First I've heard of it.

Shitloads of objectively fake, made up, fraudulent news was shared before a razor thin election (&lt;100,000 votes). In a race that close *everything* contributes, and something as obviously malignant as fraudulent news is no exception.

There is just zero evidence of that. Again, by the time we got to the election the race had changed and the polls were reflecting essentially what the outcome was. Did they get suddenly braver as the election approached or something? 
And the LA Times tracking poll was not in any way shape or form better than the aggregation of all polls. That's ridiculous. For God sakes one young upper middle class black Trump voter literally threw the entire thing off by multiple points by not responding one week. Give me a break with that shit. An interesting idea, not at all to hang your hat on. 
The race changed. It tightened, Comey took a dump on it and Trump won by the skin of his teeth- and again, not the popular vote. Any polls that had Hillary winning by a few percentages were completely correct! That's what she won by, 3 million votes. She only got a hair less than Obama in 2012, they just happened to be in the wrong places.

You did not defend your bogus argument

Yes that single overblown story was not fake... and? There were many many that were completely fake, and, again, this was an insanely close election. Are you denying that they very easily could have nudged it past the goalpost? 
Do you realize that basically all of the emails were from May? ie after Bernie was all but out of the primary? 
Is it great? Would it be nice if they acted with perfect neutrality right up until the convention? Perhaps, but the idea that it was taken as proof the election was rigged was also absurd.
