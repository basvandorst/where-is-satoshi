...really? I frequently transfer money to friends for split checks or paying them back for vacation bills or anything of the sort and chase quickpay or venmo have worked perfectly for me. I remember when transferring fiat was a huge problem a few years ago but it has been quite  awhile since I have ever had a problem or spent any time at all to send money to anyone I want.
On an unrelated note, can someone tell me why localbitcoins is so highly recommended on here? I'll admit I am new to this subreddit but the markup on localbitcoins is outrageous. I just bought .4btc on coinbase at $256/btc. On localbitcoins for a cash deposit at a bank (the only method I have found that works reliably) the cheapest offer is $271/btc. Why the hell would I ever do that?

Care to explain how this is gambling?


Care to explain what you are trying to say they *actually* do?


Care to explain why you singled out "oil tycoons" as if they are different from any other industry?
It's pretty hilarious to see you try to say *my* post has little substance. Valid rebuttal? You need to have made an actual argument to have a rebuttal. My entire post showed how every single thing you said was false. Are those not rebuttals anymore? Or do you have no idea what you are actually trying to fucking say?

Or they are using a term you don't understand.
[Bitcoin is a virtual currency]

So you don't know what a market maker is then? There is no uncertain outcome. There is no risk of losing money on a trade. They don't hold a position. They earn money off of the spread between the bid and the ask price. HFT is not gambling. 


Lol, what? That isn't at all what happened. Who the hell are you saying borrowed "billions"? The financial institutions? Who exactly did the borrow it from? And what exactly did they "gamble" it on? Do you have any idea what actually happened leading up to the financial crisis?


Hmm someone disagrees with you, they must be on drugs. Brilliant conclusion. And you say I'm a troll...


Because you know you have no clue what you are talking about? I mean, seriously dude. How the fuck do you not know the basic operation of a HFT and then try to talk about them?

1) Medium of Exchange
2) Unit of accounting
3) Store of value 
Money has all three traits. The US dollar is money. The US dollar is also currency, as you said. 
I'm not sure why people think the two are mutually exclusive....

It is legal but it does not have to be accepted everywhere. Hence why it is a **virtual** currency and not a real currency. You just proved my own point...
Dedicating over half your post to blindly repeating "ad hominem" isn't getting you anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:34:24


Please show me a definition where virtual means deficient or lesser? Virtual means similar but not the same. Period. It really isn't that difficult to understand. 


Because...you said so? Governments define bitcoin as virtual currencies, banks define bitcoins as virtual currencies, third party institutions define bitcoin as virtual currencies. Virtual isn't talking about the internet. Virtual is referring to the fact that bitcoins act like money but are not legal tender, something which is necessary for money to become currency.  Unfortunately no one really cares that you don't agree with them. Bitcoins **are** virtual currency. 


You actually have to have an argument. I'm insulting you because I have posted numerous examples and arguments that show that bitcoin is a virtual currency. All you can say is "no I don't think so." No one gives two shits what you think. If you have this much of a difficult time understanding the basic definition of a word than you are an idiot, plain and simple. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:58:47




Please tell me how this does not perfectly describe bitcoin? You cannot use the merriam webster dictionary for the economic definition of words. You need to take off your tin foil hat and actually read the wikipedia link. Being ignorant isn't something you should be proud of. You just look like an idiot for yelling about bitcoins constantly when you don't even know what a virtual currency is. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:37:52
Given the fact that a lot (I'd say most) people use bitcoins as an investment and for trading activity buying and selling is more proper terminology than exchanging. You don't say I exchanged usd for cad. You say I sold usd/cad. 
If they are exchanging purely for transacting in bitcoins than exchange would work. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:26:23
Are you brain dead? This whole thing started because you said to correct people who said bitcoin is virtual currency. Bitcoin **is** virtual currency.
[Currency is a generally accepted form of money, including coins and paper notes, which is issued by a government and circulated within an economy.]
Bitcoin is a form of money but is not issued and circulated by a government agency and as of now cannot be said to be generally accepted. Therefore it is a virtual (by your definition something that is very close but not exact) currency (and is also the reason why the ECB gave it that status, not whatever evil ploy you think they are up to). 
My ad hominem attacks are directed at you because you are the typical uneducated moron who drags bitcoins image down by associating it with your half-brained conspiracy theories and complete ignorance of basic economic principles. 
"This community" needs to embrace understanding what the hell you are talking about. Something you don't seem to be too good at. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:42:39


And this is where I realized you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Do you even know what HFT is? HFT firms are market makers. They make money off of the spread. If that is gambling than literally every merchant ever is now a gambler. 


Leveraging their *position* in a financial institution? What? Do you have any clue what you are even trying to say?


Please tell me who these great oil tycoons are? Oh, do you mean the CEO and board of directors of these companies? You know, the same way it works in *any* industry? Surprise, surprise, management gets paid more than the workers. If this is news to you that only speaks to your lack of experience. And as someone who has worked in the oil industry, I will tell you that the people fetching the oil and refining it are paid *very* handsomely for their work. Save you tears.


Yup, all managers are exploiters. Any one who doesn't actually work on the assembly line is exploiting people, right? 
Jeezus christ, how the hell do you get so ignorant? Honestly, do you never bother to actually pick up an economics text book and read? Our current system has major flaws, not many argue against that. That being said, your view of the world is hilariously ignorant. People like you really are what makes bitcoin a laughing stock in the public eye. It's the same as the Occupy WallStreet people. You love to stand on a soapbox and talk about all these issues you have yet you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about. 
Let me ask you, what do you do for a living? What is your level of education?
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:39:51
I don't think so. I never saw him use the word digital anywhere. He also says.


So saying digital wouldn't make much sense if you emphasize making paper versions. 
There is no definition of virtual that makes it even similar to fake. Virtual is "related to" or "in the essence of". It denotes that something is very similar to something else but there are some key differences. That is exactly the state of bitcoin vs other currency right now. That is why bitcoin is virtual currency. 
is just close minded and refuses to learn. Not a trait that is that uncommon in this community unfortunately.

Or without a basic macro-economics class which teaches you this in the first week... Or you could travel to another country and realize this in 5 minutes...
If bitcoin is the reason you realize this that reflects on your personal lack of education.

In any trading activity (regardless of region) you buy and sell, not exchange. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:22:34


No, no it isn't. A currency swap involves the exchange of principal and interest of a loan in one currency for the same in another currency. That isn't how typical trading in the spot market takes place...
Forex trading uses buy and sell, not exchange. You don't "exchange" usd for eur. You buy usd/eur or sell usd/eur. That's the terminology of the industry. 
I have no clue where you got the gall to try to correct someone when you are so misinformed but it was quite humorous to read.
