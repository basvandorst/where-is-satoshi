So BitPay announced their change to require payment protocol.  And now they've made that change.  I didn't care too much until I realized how many vendors use BitPay for clearing.
What a PITA.  Is there a way to manually/offline execute the protocol and get the address to give to a wallet like blockchain.info?

Also it needs to be decentralized, equitable and scalable.  Protein folding requires a trusted centralized authority to provide the inputs, could be manipulated by the authority to include inputs that are already solved (pre-mined), and if enough computation was provided it could outpace the rate at which inputs can be gathered.


Agreed.  However, it's interesting that there exist coins with PoW who have independent utility.  Primecoin calculates cunningham chains of prime numbers.  These could be useful for cryptography.

The payment protocol avoids problems like the one that is [mentioned elsewhere in the thread](
Many/most bitcoin users are much more familiar with the offline addresses, though.


Unfortunately you can squeeze a very large portion of bitcoin's market cap through a hole this small.  If the service were popular, it would be exploited.  Avoid it now before it becomes popular.

I don't think that's how law enforcement investigations usually go.  I think they would follow the trail of bread crumbs back to where it's stored.  If the person who uploaded the content and published its keys hid their tracks well, the person left holding the bag is the one running DriveShare.
Don't get me wrong, it seems like a super awesome idea and I'd like to consider running DriveShare myself.  But I think that it will end up being spoiled for everyone very quickly.

That was based on US v. Janis which held that the exclusionary rule does not apply to civil cases in which unconstitutionally seized evidence is used by a different sovereign than that which seized it.  This is a criminal case, the evidence was seized for this primary purpose, and US v. Janis might not make a good precedent.

sure, but I was replying to "$1.58/mo ... 30 GB disk ... and is expected to hit 30GB in around a year and a half."  I meant merely that I hope by that time either the price drops or the amount allowed by the vendor for that price grows beyond 30GB.

I guess I'm struggling with "Not even the user themselves" because it would seem like when I request a restore of some data that I put on the network, I must know where it comes back from (at the very least I know the nearest hop).  Just like Tor exit nodes become collateral damage in an investigation, so would the parts or whole of the Storj network implicated when someone stores something objectionable there.
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:55:11
The problem with that suggestion is that "miners" (farmers) would not produce bitcoin because they cannot satisfy Bitcoin's PoW.  So you need a new way to allocate currency.  Storj uses Proof-of-Storage, IIRC.  Note that AFAICT this is not minting new currency, just allocating it.  Since you can't have a global race-to-hash like a PoW, Proof-of-storage merely allows the storage-provider prove to the storage-consumer that I [still] have your stuff, so please pay me.
~~The initial minting of currency (SJ0 which is different from SJCX?) seems "more centralized" than Bitcoin AFAICT because it's Mastercoin-based.~~
(et al), please correct me where I'm wrong.

@_date: 2014-08-25 17:54:13
I apologize if the criticism seems harsh.  You shouldn't take it personally.  But the design of the service you propose is the heart of the problem.  This service sits in between payor and payee, effectively brokering part or all of the transaction.  Therefore it should be subject to the same scrutiny of any other part of the bitcoin ecosystem.
IMO if you think that the payment protocol does not adequately solve this/some problem, you should author a BIP that provides a new solution.
With a BIP, this idea can get the review it needs in order for people to rely on it.

Ulbricht *is* facing US justice.  Indeed, the foreign law enforcement actors are not bound by the bill of rights, but the criminal case is contingent on evidence presented before a US court.  Evidence presented which was seized on illegal grounds (and evidence which was discovered as a result of evidence seized illegally) is invalid and can be suppressed.
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:10:01
Ok, hopefully I just misunderstand the technical details, then.
But if you repeatedly ask the Storj network -- please let me download the file (or chunk) w/hash `2119e72c1edbe29f09470f7401a3d54b3bce072d`, then you can move your surveillance to the nodes that are relaying or serving the request, eventually arriving at the terminal node that has the content stored.  Or is it structured somewhat like Tor -- you can't tell externally which nodes are relays and which ones have the storage?  Even still, they'll just widen the net to include relay nodes.
@_date: 2014-08-15 14:07:06
Storj seems super-awesome IMO.  But what about when someone stores something that authorities want removed?
They could track down DriveShare users and tell them that they're hosting illegal content.  If they're remarkably friendly about it they'd just tell them nicely that they're required to stop hosting that content.  If they're unfriendly they might arrest them or charge them with a crime.  But regardless of how authorities handle it, *most* people would give up on hosting because there's no way to know whether the (encrypted but keys publicly available in some other index) content is objectionable.  I don't foresee authorities saying "Dang, well, looks like we've been beaten -- there's no way to stop 'em."  Even if there really is no way to stop the propagation of illegal content -- that would never keep them from trying to enforce the laws.
Unlike bitcoin, I suppose DriveShare will not get a warm welcome domestically (US).  Or it will be short-lived, anyways.  Or some centralized service(s) will show up, offering up a set of blacklisted hashes for chunks your DriveShare client shouldn't accept.  Many folks would quickly give up on "decentralized" if they can participate in Storj with less fear of reprisal from law enforcement.  They'll probably see this centralized service as something akin to AdBlock.

IMO there is a real risk of just that -- that miners will fork to preserve the block rewards in the future if tx fees can't sustain their capital investment.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:15:36
I've not been paying attention to this debate very much other than checking in once a quarter or so.  I had assumed that all of the pools had decided to signal on behalf of all of their miners and didn't know there was a way to delegate it to the pool miners themselves.
I think having the pool members have their say is much more democratic and you should be praised for delegating it to them.  But I worry that a potentially good feature here is lost behind the fact that segwit sounds like a very subtle, detailed feature proposal.  Many/most probably don't understand the pros/cons, let alone the details of what this change entails.  Would it make sense for pools to have an opt-out or some kind of "default vote" after a certain date?  Or does that already exist somehow?

The terms are very similar when it comes to bitcoin.  I prefer "exchange rate" because it treats Bitcoin as if it were currency.  However some folks certainly treat it more like a commodity sometimes, in which case the term "price" makes more sense.
These terms are generally used interchangably.

I think I understand why people bash BIP70 and I think it was a huge mistake for Bitpay to move to require it.  I think their motivations were bad (supporting bitcoin cash etc).  
But I also think that the concept underlying BIP70 seems like a good one.   It creates a payment "channel" with lots of transaction details including a refund address.  If I were a merchant I would think it would require less support work with something-like-BIP70 than without.

Around that time I (solo) mined overnight and found zero blocks and figured I was doing it wrong.  So I calculated how long it would take to find a block at my hash rate and figured it was a huge waste of time (something like ~2 weeks to find one lousy block).

I think the majority of vendors who accept bitcoin would be willing to enable blacklists if some good-intentioned law enforcement agency sponsored the blacklists as a way to mitigate the massive thefts that occur at exchanges.

I like your (paranoid) style.  But I think it's probably more likely that they'd focus on getting access to paper wallets which have been generated rather than having the sophistication/planning to try to capture those which have not yet been generated.  Maybe someone with Richard Branson's profile should be so careful, but most of us who know someone who is not trustworthy but have access can count those people on one hand.  
Resources to secure wallets are finite and would be better spent securing the wallets themselves IMO.
That said, a CD is a pretty reasonable starting point.  Someone probably makes a USB-flash drive with a read-only hardware bit that can be fused (again, not foolproof against tampering, but a good risk/reward balance IMO).

I think it would erupt in the black market domestically and continue to grow abroad.  The US would need broad support from trade partners to make accepting bitcoin illegal, and they're not likely to get much help beyond Europe.
It's nigh impossible to stop transactions and mining without eliminating/disrupting the Internet.

I think it's only a matter of time before BofA and similar banks offer a local bitcoin currency exchange/wallet for individual account holders.  There's bound to be demand when big merchants come on board.  The banks' biggest obstacle will be trying to educate their customers about fraud but they can probably partner with a big commercial escrow to mitigate some of that.
Right now, if you want bitcoin, you often have to do one of:
* sell goods or services
* find a trustworthy seller on localbitcoins and take not-too-much cash for an in-person transaction
* wire money to a currency exchange, often internationally
... not to mention creating and securing a wallet.  All of these are inconvenient in one way or another, so there's real opportunity for banks to get a piece of the action.  Banks are where many people (at least professionals) get paid via direct deposit and therefore where a lot of discretionary income is ready to be traded for bitcoin.  If they can reduce the complexity of getting bitcoin down to the level of their bill pay services, bitcoin adoption will probably soar, perhaps even more than it would with a couple of big-name merchants.

Opportunity cost, baby!  The lead time on an ASICMINER USB eruptor (finished, working design) is much less than the predicted lead time of a KNCMiner Jupiter.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but shares of a company's stock are indivisible and stock splits facilitate liquidity, not so much unit bias.

He almost certainly didn't mean a decentralized currency.  Bitcoin doesn't need a decentralized currency, but you could envision one in which a blockchain required signatures from an authoritative node with a well-known public key.  
Sure, there would be a lot not to like about such a currency but if it were officially endorsed by the federal government it would almost certainly hold some value.

They should, but IMO for a different reason.  Banks should all be rushing to incorporate BTC (etc) into their services.  Cryptocurrencies are designed to require little/no pre-established trust, but in practice people really like having a broker take some of their risk.
How awesome would it be if banks treated cryptocoins similar to foreign currency and gave you the opportunity to exchange with them instead of needing to go to a public exchange?  A great way to get BTC available to the masses, IMO.  And the great thing is that it's in a bank's interest to provide this service!  They can take fees from exchange/withdrawal transactions (some fees here are legitimate IMO).

Real Chili is pretty awesome.

They can legislate how businesses who accept bitcoin should act if they give fiat, or goods/services in return.  Also, transaction brokers who accept bitcoin and deliver fiat to the merchant will likely be included.
Arguably, today's laws which govern how merchants should act when they accept fiat currency issued by a foreign government already cover whatever new laws/guidelines they might issue.  But they'll likely feel the need to make BTC-specific laws.
The upshot of this is that things like publicly traded securities who want to hold BTC can do so without fear once the government has convened and issued an edict.
Indeed, some merchants or individuals who wish to conduct bitcoin transactions will never opt-in to whatever regulatory measures are devised.  But what about the Amazon.com's of the world?  
They collect sales taxes where necessary and comply with embargoes and such.  If they were ever inclined to accept bitcoin, they would definitely comply with whatever regulations are passed.
