Quantum computing is quick computing, not smart computing. It's not a good solution for magically modeling real world problems that involve things like imperfect compound interfaces and totally unpredictable use case scenarios(people do boneheaded things with products).
Simulations are only as good as the known constants going in and when you're doing novel designing those constants aren't known to begin with. 
Additionally much of engineering, especially my job, is field and manufacturing work. Creating an ideal optimization is different than keeping the machinery doing the manufacturing running. And it's different than going out in the field and conducting informed investigations on performance.
Nerds on Reddit overblow what quick computation can magically solve. Calculators sped calculations up many orders of magnitude and there wasn't mass unemployment as a result. Don't expect history to not repeat going forward. Humanity has always found work no matter how many tools it's created to increase efficiency

1960s era servers and batch processing solved the counting problem. We've had distributed networks for maintaining balances and processing transactions for quite some time.
Bitcoin is simply an effort to take that network and processing away from a collaborative government/bank system and put it in the hands of the public directly(more specifically Chinese mining conglomerates)

No, IRS guidance and whatnot are never used in court cases unless they are specifically about the codes they regard.
And most personal insurance policies have low, hard limits on collectibles coverage(cash, coins, stamp collections etc etc) and require substantially higher premiums to insure then fully, and yes it would be easy to call a bitcoin collection a collectible.. 
No, in reality people would end up paying exorbitantly more if they tried to insure large amounts of bitcoin.

It's obtuse to think federal classifications have anything to do with private insurance coverage. That coverage is spelled out in your policy and isn't defined off of any federal classifications for unrelated codes.

You clearly have no idea what A/B testing is. For 1 day they made their donate page link send people to 1 of 2 pages. 1/3 of people clicking the link were sent to the "A" page, which is the standard donation page. This is the control group. 2/3 were sent to the "B" page, the test page with bitcoin added. Because this happens via random selection and the groups were selected from the same pool of people at the exact same time it's safe to say they are statistically the same. The *only* difference was the bitcoin addition and since all other variables were successfully held it is safe to say it's the culprit. 


Yes there is! "A" is the test group. And the time delta in this case yielded 150,000 points of data. More than enough to draw a statistically rigorous conclusion.

Okay... So why are you acting like it is some huge "dangerous" problem? Isn't "in reality" what matters?


[And consumers losing their money with no recourse because the overwhelming majority of people aren't good at IT security wouldn't be costly?]( Because consumers having to spend time practicing excess security and spend money on buying dedicated hardware wouldn't be costly? 
A system of professionals doing security and being able to reverse transactions is a hell of a lot less dangerous than a system banking on a layperson doing security where there is no way to reverse hacked funds, forgotten keys, damaged hardware. How delusional are you that you think that system is actually "in reality" safer?

Bitcoiners keep proving again and again that fraud and loss is very much a major issue with bitcoin. Push vs pull doesn't really matter when people are so poor with IT security and liable to have their own machine compromised. I just don't see any evidence that bitcoin is any more secure from a practicality standpoint. 


Free checking exists and most have it. I haven't paid a fee to my bank in over 15 years. The only people who pay fees are the people who are poor with managing their money, and these are the types of people who should stay away from bitcoin since poor financial skills and financial laziness are not at all forgiving in the bitcoin world.

You wouldn't if enough people paid via that option that it made up the difference. You're right, all additions generate friction, but they don't all generate the same amount in increased revenue. The friction from adding credit cards is overwhelmingly outweighed by the fact that so many people do pay with them. In bitcoin's case the amount of people paying via bitcoin isn't enough to offset the friction from adding the additional text.

That's not what's happening. Additional complexity to any payment pages in general causes people to buy/pay less. It's not about bitcoin, it's about additional text/logos/graphics etc etc cluttering up the page. It only makes sense to include an addition if enough new people use that option to counteract the loss from having a slightly more complex page. For whatever reason people subconsciously spend less when there is *any* friction added to their payment experience.

An insolvent or failing company could conceivably pull off Proof of Reserves. The only way to actually determine the viability of a company financially is to look at the *entire* budget sheet, and this importantly includes liabilities. For instance a company could be drowning in leasing and salary obligations and simply keep taking out loans to cover them while preserving their bitcoin reserves and in the process building up massive liability, and eventually they'll hit their credit line and default and all of a sudden those reserves are now part of a bankruptcy case and will be split with other creditors. 
Proof of Reserves is a really lazy and erroneous way to *prove* viability and you won't really find actual financial professionals putting much faith into a company that only uses proof of reserves to prove their viability since they realize it's so easy to game. 
Opening their entire books to third party certified public accountants, ideally multiple, so that they can verify that the company's income and assets are enough to cover its current and upcoming liabilities is really the only proper method of transparency.

Honestly, the things that the blockchain "helps" with are things computers made rudimentary and easy to do decades ago. Checking cash reserves and whatnot is the easiest step of auditing and can be done with a few keystrokes as is. 
The part that's actually challenging is the part a blockchain wouldn't actually address, which is verifying and valuing assets and employees and liability etc etc. Auditors actually do things like go on site and physically verify with their own eyes the existence of equipment and that it actually operates, or the existence of employees, they'll go and make sure the $50 million building the company claims to own is actually worth $50 million and isn't some falling down piece of shit not worth anything. 
The blockchain doesn't really help auditors with anything that isn't already covered via existing financial software.

Um, for a large company to actually use the blockchain for record keeping usefully they're going to need software to interface with it and manage that data, which is also going to be hugely expensive.
Basic spreadsheet programs are also dirt cheap, but they don't cut it for major companies, just like the blockchain being "cheap" doesn't mean utilizing it will be cheap for companies. Both systems need a polished user interface and automated management to be useful and that's going to cost largely the same for both.

Yes, within the subreddits you are a natural community member of.

To be clear, they never even had an audit in May. "Proof of reserves" is a very different thing that a financial audit. Proof of reserves only examines their bitcoin reserves. An actual audit would examine bitcoin reserves, all additional assets and most importantly liabilities. Without liabilities known you can't really say anything about the viability of an operation.

Sure, and the big legal check to differentiate the two is whether or not a business is allocating assets to specific customers. 
Example of allocation: You put a $20 bill in a safety deposit box at bank. When you go back and open your box you will get that exact same bill back because the bank can't touch it. In cases of allocation like this the bank is merely a custodian and has no ownership of the bill. If the bank goes under you are still getting your safety deposit box content out 
Example of nonallocation: You deposit a $20 bill into your checking account. You don't expect to see that exact bill again, you simply expect the bank to owe you $20 worth of bills when you ask to withdraw. So the bank was allowed to take that original bill and mix it up with others and in the future can hand you any $20 bill to pay you back. In cases of non allocation like this you transfered ownership of the money to them and it will be subject to higher priority creditors if things go bad.
Every major exchange operates like the latter and not the former. None are allocating specific coins to specific users, so based on that treatment legally speaking they own those coins.

As was I. So lets pretend a company has been good about separating deposits from operational expenses, but it was still not allocating deposits(it was tossing them into big wallets). And then lets pretend that due to mismanagement they default on those operational expenses and get taken to court over them. 
Now it's no longer up to the company how things are paid for, it's up to a court. Since they were not allocating deposits the court must consider those deposits property of the company and therefore eligible to be used to pay back creditors, and that's exactly what the court will do. It will order those reserves tapped to pay back higher tier creditors and it will leave customers with less money. 
That's why it's important to care about the rest of the budget sheet for these exchanges, because if those other parts of the budget sheet get bad and a court steps in that court is going to be using those reserves to pay salaries, utilities, lenders etc etc, entities that have higher priorities than depositing customers.

 And without something like an audit you would have no way of knowing that the company could be doing something like using its reserves as collateral to take out loans for a neat cafe they wanted to build, which if it failed could mean they're all of a sudden insolvent.

It's actually more reversed. 99.99% of the time they work and do their job. The financial industry calls audits "reasonable assurance" for a reason. There's a reason you have to go back 15 years past millions of audits to get examples(WorldCom, Enron) of major firm failures, they simply aren't common. The cost of failure is too devastating for firms to even consider doing anything but their job correctly these days, Enron for instance led to the pretty much overnight annihilation of a firm pulling in over $9 Billion dollars a year.

Still not really an audit. An exchange has other financial obligations apart from simply the people using the service. They have real estate to pay for, salaries to pay, utilities to pay, hardware to pay for, insurance(hopefully) to pay for etc etc. All these other obligations will not show on their site but all these other obligations can certainly put them under in regards to liability, and if they default because of them those reserves will be frozen and some of that money will be going to other creditors. 
This is why it's law in nearly all nations on earth for major financial entities to be fully audited, it's too easy to play games by only showing selected portions of the budget sheet to a public who largely doesn't know enough to realize that isn't a reasonable assurance of solvency.

It isn't useful, it's a partial picture of finances that will serve only to fool the uneducated that it's a reasonable assurance of solvency, which it is not. What you are doing would actually be against the law for every other financial institution in existence. By law every other financial institution releases full financial statements in line with GAAP that are verified by CPAs, they don't run counters on their website for arbitrary asset categories. 


Then call PwC, call Deloitte, call KPMG, call EY, call any number of respected firms... If you're willing to do it then you would be doing it. But you aren't, so clearly this part of you being "willing" is a lie.


So? This is an excuse to not act like a professional financial institution? Even mom and pop donut shops get audits, you don't need to be a $50 million institution to warrant one.

Yes, CPA's are. They are certified to audit toy companies, natural gas companies, aerospace companies, plastics companies, pharmaceuticals, investment companies, social media companies, digital retailers etc etc. It doesn't really matter what industry or what business a company is in, a CPA is certified to audit it. 
An audit is conducted by a CPA but does not only involve a CPA in many cases. In many cases, particularly for large companies, various internal experts or consultants are brought in to aid in the verification part of the audit process and operate under the eye of the CPA. Thankfully though verifying bitcoins is pretty rudimentary and every major auditing firm in the United States has IT guys in house who could readily do it. Verifying crypto would probably be the single easiest step of the entire audit process in fact.

To clarify the differences.
*"Proof of reserves"* - Simply showing you have X number of bitcoins. 
*"Financial Audit"* - An extensive examination of a business's financial statements that is not limited to a single asset category like proof of reserves is. Assets(Real estate, employees, hardware, reserves, etc etc) are examined and verifed along with liabilities(leases, loans, utilities, salaries, premiums etc etc.) "Proof of reserves" is one of the easiest and most basic steps of an actual audit and by itself is fairly worthless. And importantly an actual audit is conducted by a CPA, someone with years of university level accounting education under their belt who has gone through rigorous testing to verify they aren't liable to be duped by creative fraudulent accounting or to make egregious mistakes. 
Proof of reserves simply proves the existence of bitcoins, an audit is a reasonable assurance that the company is solvent and not lying to the public.

1.) Is this generally accepted as true?
Yes, it's pretty commonly known that exchanges don't maintain hundreds of thousands of individual bitcoin wallets, one for each individual user, and actually mostly lop their coins into huge cold and hot wallets. In fact many of these large exchange wallets have been identified by the community.


I've never seen one claim to the contrary, and some have done "proofs" by showing they have control of huge wallets, which would be indicative that they are in fact putting customer deposits all together instead of keeping each deposit separate of all the rest.

Did you know electric vehicles of the era were insanely inefficient compared to even modern day gas guzzling pickup trucks and only had top ranges of only 10 to 30 miles and top speeds around 15 to 20 mph? Can you explain to me how citing 1909 era electric cars supports that the technology hasn't improved by orders of magnitude? It's starting to feel like I'm speaking with someone who has a very limited understanding of engineering and history.

It didn't make sense to you that sectors that require a massive amount of capital to start up in aren't going to have lots of competition? 
It didn't make sense to you that a drug company could make it even harder on their competition to startup by jacking up the prices so the competition can't buy up a bunch of their product to test?
Really? That doesn't make any sense? How old are you?
@_date: 2015-09-27 11:42:46
Drug production isn't easy, the high capital needed to get a production facility off of the ground for a specific drug dissuades newcomers from trying to compete. And due to a lack of regulation(or in other words, a more free market) it isn't illegal for a company to jack up the price and make it even costlier for a competitor to start up production as now they will have a difficult time buying up the brand drug to test and make sure their generic is the right formula.

Okay, realistically, what's the best that could happen for a federal employee going through all this work to alter world markets secretly to help the US  Marshal's bottom line by a fraction of a percent. Realistically how many US Marshal members even have the financial resources or intellect to do this? And this potential person is going to do all this work at what risk?
To me, the answer to that first question is the small possibility of a marginal salary increase as there is presumably a itty bitty bigger budget than before. The second question's answer is close to zero if not zero. And the third question's answer is years in federal prison.
It just doesn't add up to me as reasonable

You know that we have combustion cars that can reach 760 mph now right? That's basically what you sound like talking about a 1900s era electric vehicles that went 65 mph. No one is really driving around in 760 mph cars today just like no one was driving in 65 mph electric vehicles back then because those were vehicles specifically made for land speed records and not every day driving and never were in any production for consumers.
 In 1905 if you wanted to go buy an electric car you were getting something that topped out at 20 mph at best and likely couldn't finish a marathon on a charge(a charge mind you largely coming from a coal based grid that was spewing shit out).
Brilliant example.

What do you mean "now?" Show me where I *ever* equated legal with morality.
Bottom line is a legal seizure is not stealing by the very definition of the word. Stealing is by definition illegal, if something is legal then it can't be defined as stealing. End of story.
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:42:50
Most people understand that legality and morality are different concepts, it's sad that you don't. What you feel the way things should be is not what constitutes legality. Stealing is illegal seizure, what the US did is provided for in the US Code, therefore it's factually not stealing. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:09:28


No, I never made that assumption. The actual assumption I made is that whatever the government passes as a law is law. As in if it's in real life legal it's not accurate for you to go around and call it illegal, that's not how the world works.

No? S&amp;P has trended up long term for decades and decades, consecutive down months have always been the exception, not the norm for the index. 


Dude, if you were bothering to use trend analysis to predict the oil market you're a fucking retard. Everyone in the industry knew prices were going to plummet because the massive capital investments  made 5-6 years ago were due to come online in the US and start pumping out oil, flooding the market with it. Oil prices are a function of supply, not speculative trend bullshit. 


The bitcoin market wasn't a coin flip, it was a steady downturn. What you did is akin to a professor handing out a T/F quiz with every answer being false and you flipped one coin in the beginning and whichever it landed on was your answer for the whole test. 50/50

**Which is 100% fractional reserve banking...** Fractional reserve simply refers to a bank having reserves that are a fraction of their deposit liabilities. 
In that example the bank has a deposit liability of $100 but since it loaned out $50 it only has $50 in reserves, which is a fraction of its $100 liability(1/2 to be precise). Hence fractional reserve banking...

Stealing by definition is taking property without legal right, so since it is in fact legal in the united states for assets to be seized if they were proceeds from crime this by definition is not stealing.

This isn't actually true. Bitcoin is wildly more inefficient than traditional payment networks.
