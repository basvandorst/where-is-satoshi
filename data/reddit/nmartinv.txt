At the end of the day all that really matters is if you believe that sidechains are the way to scale or not, which personally I believe they are.

blockstream is one company of many creating sidechains (among other things) for btc

How can you have direct experience for something that has not happened yet? and so what?  I am putting my money in the project I believe in.
Satoshi did not consider everything though such as the effect mining pools would have or the centralised development of asic miners.  BTC was a huge work in progress even as he left the project and he warned that it was not ready for mass adoption.

Roger talks about how they can also add LN to bitcoin cash, but I thought the whole point of their argument was that they can infinitely scale on chain?  Now LN is a good idea?

and his past performance wasnt even that accurate
although we may end up at 5k in 2018 like he said but not in the way he predicted I'm sure...
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:52:23
yes exactly!! I'm so tired of his shit and crying when he cant manipulate/scam people

Well Buffett would disagree with you, and probably everyone else that has made a substantial amount of money.  The time to take (calculated) risks are when you are young and without a family to care for, diversify once you already have a substantial amount of money.

He was never into tech though but his principles still apply for other things like building business etc, just look at someone like Elon Musk who went all in on every business he has started (they would have failed otherwise)
What I'm saying is for an average US millennial (who this article is talking about) making diversified investments with small starting capital is rather pointless if your future salary earnings will outweigh any amount you could have made from putting it in diversified investments during that time period.
It makes way more sense to research your options thoroughly and go all in on what you believe will bring you the most returns - whatever it is (certain stocks, crypto, a business, beanie babies etc)

They really shouldnt allow anyone to own an account like this that can be used mislead/scam people

read 
"When Warren Buffett thinks he has a good idea, he doesn't just test the water temperature with his toe; he goes all in. This is very rare in the investment world, in which many individuals will take small positions to track certain stocks or won't allow any one stock to comprise more than 10% - or some other arbitrary percentage - of their total portfolio. Warren Buffett believes that when you're presented with an opportunity, you must go after it with everything that you have. "

you can withdraw cash (they send it in the mail) or use localbitcoins
or just use a different bank

thats not what I'm saying, I'm saying he doesnt diversify if there is something that he thinks will bring him more returns.
I dont care if you put all your money in stocks or whatever but spreading out 5k inbetween different investments is pointless
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:11:45
no dude, read what the fuck I said, if you are a millennial and have 5k does it make sense to diversify?  how do you think he made his billions?  by playing every move safely?  diversification is for when you already have wealth
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:21:55
fuck me they gave in to these dimwits again
personally I think no one should have control of an account like this (not even a bitcoin supporter) as it can just be used to spread false information
