In the leaked data, there is a user ID connected to all trades. In later trades, a user hash is added that can be used to lookup deposits/withdrawals by user. Deposits/withdrawals can be linked to Bitcoin addresses in the blockchain.
The data may also have contained email addresses, names and copies of identification.

"The key insight of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is misleadingly simple: if an exchange between two parties is voluntary, it will not take place unless both believe they will benefit from it. Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple insight, from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another."

The chart doesn't actually go to zero (log scale, so zero is not possible). But User 15's trades do extend far outside the range of these graphs.
Where does it say orders are graphed? It's all trades.

We used:
* csvkit to examine the csv files and get them in a common format.
* sqlite as a database to order by volume and export data by user
* d3.js to render the visualizations
* phantom.js to export the visualizations to PNGs

Technically, Yen value. That's the common currency unit for all trades. Click on a graph to get a legend for the circle size. Note that circles can overlap-- so you can't get a precise sense of volume, just a rough sense.
We also tried with BTC, which makes early trades look much larger than those at the end.
