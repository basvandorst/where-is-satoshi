PUMPER? 
First of all this was an expression of the fact, that i am enthusiastic about the Bitcoin idea and of my opinion, that this idea cannot die.
Second i am NOT an altcoin pumper, maybe "maintainer" would be much more respectful. Given that one of the most powerful advantages of the Bitcoin revolution is CHOICE, altcoins, succesful or not, are playing an important role, when it comes to make sure, thiere are alternatives in place, in case they are needed and Bitcoin is not getting the first decentralized single point of failure (wich, luckily, may be unlikely) 
Third is i haven't time to pump cions, i do not even trade.  
I am building an alternative economic environment for europe and
i am proud of what we do. 
Or do you think 
THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN "PUMPED" INTO OUR COIN?:
Maybe you would like to read our OP and get a REAL opinion:
have fun
(proud Europecoin maintainer)

I think he likes to outline the fact, that there is no reason to fear, because, the IDEA will not die because of any event like that. There is no reason to fear Bitcoin evolving in an undesired manner, in the same way there is no reason to fear it dying: CRYPTO CURRENCY will never die. Bitcoin is just an Idea and it can manifest and evolve new, every time the community is disatisfied with the outcome of the existing version
