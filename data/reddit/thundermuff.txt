Educated people are more likely to have crippling student debt as well. Lol

Just cuz you're educated doesn't mean you make good decisions

Sure ACH transactions take 3 days, which isn't fast. However there are several other ways to do transactions instantly. Also companies like PayPal offer an escrow service to make transfers between internal accounts instantaneous to the end user

The FDIC insures bank accounts up to 100,000 USD. I am just stating facts, no need to insult my intelligence

But traditional rails work easily and quickly most of the time. Bitcoin is annoying to use and people don't like converting their USD to bitcoin. Bitcoin is not subject to government manipulation so it's volatile and also not insured. Most people prefer to use the traditional rails over the less reliable, more annoying, and more scary alternative bitcoin offers.

Ok fine. My point was that the US government has a vested interest in making the USD an attractive currency. In order to make USD attractive they create agencies whose mission is to stabilize and grow the value of the USD. Additionally they provide services around the USD such as insuring bank accounts.
Bitcoin is not yet mature enough to offer this sort of consumer protection. Get it? I don't care if you as an individual are totally fine with using bitcoin, the point is that most people aren't fine with it for the reasons I've mentioned.
