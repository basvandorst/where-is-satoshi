* It's hard to read the now trending section.
* There is a LOT of whitespace that seems awkward. Perhaps put the bitcoin price widget in some of this space?
* I have an ultra wide monitor and the background does not look that great tiled.
* The overall color scheme just seems blah (grey and yellow?)
* The bank and fireball image seems a little cheesy/forced. 
* The righthand column seems to lose structure. ie: the heading is about the same size as the text beneath, it just seems like a haphazard list of links.
* The Resources and Media links in the sidebar should just be tabs in your menu bar.
* Each news item has a label "post" or "educational", I have no idea what just "post" means in this context. It makes more sense to me to have the tag be "video", "blog", "article" etc, and the title of the news item should indicate it is educational.
* Not sure why the guides section has its own page AND is at the bottom of your posts page.
* Your donate bitcoin image does not indicate it is clickable, you also have a "donate to us" link at the bottom of your page (redundant?)
edit: added few more bullets
edit 2: I am not a professional web programmer, but I have done it in my spare time. This is mostly opinion.

High speed trading is considered a competitive advantage so much so that even fractions of a second can mean profits. 
Would an exchange that delays broadcasting orders give everyone a blanket disadvantage? For example, with bitUSD or NuBits a decentralized exchange could be made that broadcasts orders every time a new block is created. 
I don't know if this will work but if someone with more knowkledge on the subject would like to talk about it pm me

Do you frequent the Dogecoin subreddit? There is a rather large list of sites selling goods and services. Moolah.io has a very good merchant platform to use for selling goods. There is an ongoing debate about how to secure the network as each halving comes which is loosely tied to the fact that there is no cap for coins. As long as Dogecoin remains profitable to mine the miners will exist to secure the network. Talk of moving to Pos or a hybrid system or merge mining with litecoin is being looked at but every solution has a downside and the devs are considering every possible solution. Also having no cap means many things but usually ends up a useless debate about inflation vs deflation. 
I also ask you to consider the fact that Dogecoin has only existed for around six months. The progress the community has made is actually astonishing in this given time period. 
I'll be honest. I have absolutely no idea if this currency will survive. We don't have an innovative idea like dark coin or the background of bitcoin, but we have the best community I have ever seen on reddit or anywhere else on this world. It is that community that I believe in and why I think dogecoin will eventually reach the moon.

I read somewhere that if just 10% of a population believes in something strong enough it will eventually be adopted by a majority of said population. I guess the US is at roughly 3% now.

You may never want to or need to and that is perfectly OK. Some people want to tip others for many reasons. This cannot be done with credit cards in their current form. Bitcoin has overlap with many existing entities and that is also OK. Both can exist together.

Here is an interactive example for a [simple bloom filter]( While this is not exactly like an invertible bloom filter it can help with understanding the underlying principle.
Basically this data structure allows you to store many different items in a predefined amount of space AND allows you to confirm within a certain probability that an item exists in the table.
[This guy]( has done some interesting analysis of using invertible bloom filters.
[This article]( is about the scalability of bitcoin. Scroll to the "How far does this lead" section. I realise this is a lot less technical and more hand wavy but the napkin math can be verified (for instance my internet could handle about the same number of txs as in the article).
edit - In conclusion: IBFs allow for (mostly) constant and predictably sized blocks. Moore's Law states that hard drive space is increase exponentially. Therefore the blockchain will never* have storage issues. Bandwidth issues seem to be not an issue as far as I can tell.
*Never say never

He's not wrong. Banks are middle men between two parties who need to exchange value. In this case they no longer fulfilled that role.

The ignorance of your post is blatant. Regardless of the price dropping or the fact Dogecoin is a meme does not detract from the fact that Dogecoin is a positive and optimistic safehaven in an otherwise negative world. The real world impact the coin has had cannot be ignored either. I agree with you, Dogecoin is not technologically innovate when compared to bitcoin BUT Dogecoin is something unique and innovative on a social level. Just because you don't see any real value in it does not mean value does not exist. 
I highly suggest you think about things more objectively. You have good points but your reasonings are just emotion.
Edit: typos

Also keep in mind that the top 100 rich list is actually the top 100 rich addresses. Satoshi never spent any of his known block rewards and i believe he used a new address for every block he mined. I believe Satoshi also said NEVER delete a wallet so it is very likely he still has control of those keys. Sorry i dont have a source for that statement.

I wanted to find out if you guys had a store in my area but I can't figure out how to find that information without signing up. This is a common but very frustrating trend I'm seeing with almost every new service that comes out. I'm not going to spend the time signing up unless i know you guys can provide a service for me.

I'm assuming someone has considered that maybe the reason he stopped contributing was from death (accidental or otherwise). Not saying it's likely but maybe look at techies that died around that time period.

As long as a system like this is opt in there is no reason it would be scary. A forum could require real identities, identities older than X days or allow anonymous users. The brilliant thing about bitcoin is everything derived from it is opt in.

It has been ubuntu all three times I've tried personally. And the ubuntu installs at my college are pretty buggy as well. Don't get me wrong, I love open source, I love the idea of linux... but when something goes wrong in linux, finding a fix is not a trivial task.
edit: also, I will keep trying linux every chance I get. It has improved leaps and bounds since my original attempt 5 years ago. Just not quite where it needs to be for my personal use yet :)

It really isn't though. Debating is a great way to spread information and to debunk misinformation. These types of talks should happen more imo.

I mean I agree with you but your post literally added nothing. At least put in a little effort,  maybe not for the person you are replying to but for someone else who might not know why. For example:
Satoshi Nakamoto is known to have upwards of 1 million coins. Amazon also would never need or want that many coins especially as a speculative investment.  This is not saying they aren't interested in using it as a payment method.

A simple google search proves that the blockchain can and will scale. 
I suggest you start [here]( 
Another new innovation [currently being implemented](  called [invertible bloom filters]( will allow for efficient bandwidth scaling. 
Size of the block will always scale linearly which if one knew about [Moore's Law]( would know harddrive space is negligible.
So no, it's not awkward at all.

I agree not everything needs to be decentralized. But I ([and]( - [ many ]( - [others]( also believe that there are many areas that can be decentralized. 


I'm not sure how much research you've done into the subject but [3d printed guns]( are much safer than you realise.


3d printing is already getting [cheaper]( and [higher quality](


Anyone who believes that these technologies [won't get better]( in time would be naive as well. 


You don't [reddit much]( do you?
When talking about decentralization it is a discussion of the future. What can WE as a society do in the future to improve not just our own lives, but the lives of everyone on this planet. These are very exciting times to live in.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:37:38
While 3d printing may never be as cheap or have as good of quality as other options, I believe the more important role is the decentralization of things. Guns are a a good example where 3d printing can have huge implications. Removing centralized control over certain goods has many implications both good and bad. 
Another use case is if a part breaks for anything such an automobile to a factory to a space station(!) , as long as you have a 3d printer you can instantly replace the broken part. This idea is very powerful. In addition, logistics becomes simpler when delivering supplies. For example, a doctor in a 3rd world country would not need order things like needles because instead they can be printed and instead orders the "ink" which can be printed into many useful tools. Eventually the tools can be melted back down (sterilized) and then reprinted as needed.

Banks have a very negative connotation but i think there is room for them to adapt as a multisig partner that verifies transactions and rejects suspicious ones. 2 of 3 keys would still be owned by the user. Fractional reserve banking would still be impossible. Otherwise i agree with what you said :)

It allows you to share information on a public ledger with another person without revealing the information to the public.
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:52:49
With crytocurrency you can send your address encrypted with the sellers public key so that only the seller can see your home address. And yes this can be done automatically without registering with a new service since that private information can be tied to the buyers wallet.
