See, that argument doesn't really work. If I plan on using it as currency (what it claims to be) and I put $1000 of Fiat in now – it *absolutely* matters what happens to the price. I could lose a lot of the value that I put in, or it could go up a ton. Technically it still does what it is supposed to do – but everything else in the *real world* is a value backed asset. Anything I want to buy has value, that doesn't fluxuate with the unstable price of crypto, and the USD doesn't fluxuate as radically either. 
It's a serious problem and hodl is basically useless. Value matters. What "It's supposed to do" is be a currency, and while it technically will fulfill that claim so long as it doesn't crash to absolute zero, it's problematic for nearly everyone in the world. Extremely problematic. The difference between being able to buy groceries or a house. Why would the common person take that gamble just for decentralization? What do I actually get for that tradeoff, as someone who currently holds USD? Which is extremely stable relative to the fluctuations of Bitcoin.. Great, it's decentralized and full of tech – but the most important part of the equation, stability, just isn't here yet and won't be for a while.
If you're a winklevoss twin, or Tim draper, or a ballsy 20 something with nothing to lose, or a LinkedIn "Crypto enthusiast" OK. But Bitcoin is still a LONG way from doing the thing that it's supposed to do. Yes, you can buy things with it. (In select places) What can you buy with it? Who knows?! Depends on the day of the week.

That Y axis is ... how do I say this? – fucked. It's fucked.

Just throwing this out there. IMO if this scenario happens, the state of society is in question and we may be trading bottle caps post nuclear blast. 
Don't get me wrong, Fiat can obviously crash. In our case the USD could weaken and ultimately be made obsolete (this is happening by the way, just on the order of decades).
In the case of a crash type scenario, there are bigger questions than debt. Perhaps even questions of "where is the food coming from now?" And "am I going to die soon?'

It's fair market value is $14,500. PM me for Tom Lee's phone number, he'll snatch it up in a heartbeat
