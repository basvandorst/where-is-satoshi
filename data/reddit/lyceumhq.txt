Funny (not so much) story. Back in 2011 I bought 20 Bitcoin to pay for some nzb sits access. Only used 5 as they ran a discount. 
Left the rest thinking I'd use it later. Lost the wallet details and now have zero idea where they are. Can't even remember what wallet I used. What are they worth now?

I've not. Mostly because I can't remember what wallet it was. I've tried to google what were the most popular then but no luck so far. 
Bitcoin was very confusing to me then so I'm pretty sure I would have googled 'buy Bitcoin' and gone to the top results etc. Will check those sites out. 
Edit. I think it might be blockchain. I just went to the site and did the forgot details link and it sent an email with a wallet identifier. But I can't remember my password.

I lost access to a wallet that's got around 20 BTC sat in it �� I got them when it was less that $1 per coin.

To be honest I don't even know what wallet I used. Bitcoin was brand new to me and I have no real idea what it was or how it worked. I just knew I needed some to pay to get VIP on an nzb site. I ended up buying double what I needed by accident and just forgetting about it until a while later when Bitcoin hit the mainstream news. My own stupidity!
It was 2011 and I know it was an online wallet not a software one.

I did buy some Bitcoin around 2010. Not massive amount at the time. About 20 Bitcoin. Can't for the life of me remember where they are now. That is what you call stupid!
