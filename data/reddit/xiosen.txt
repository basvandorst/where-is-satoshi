That seems to be the case unfortunately. We have a long-term relationship and they would be flexible if I asked them to be. But it would be a pain for them to teach the bookkeeper internally. If the owners were the ones writing the checks then I wouldn't have much of an issue.
Its a great idea though. I would just have to calculate how long and experiment with trying to selling 1.5 btc weekly locally and if the profit  / time investment would be worth just eating the 1200/yr for paypal fees.

In the future I could see doing that, however that isn't completely doable yet since I can't pay all my living expenses with bitcoin. The goal of my post was not to just convert the currency but rather automate the process so its easy for the client to make a payment from AUD bank account and end up in my US one.

That was suggested in the other comments, but it looks like at best it would only save $10/year with my current figures because they still have to pay 2% to buy it.

I don't mind if the extra hassle is on my end. I just want it convenience for them to pay. I would gladly shuffle the money around to be able to withdraw to USD for $1200+ / year.
So it sounds like the best bet so far is look into creating a Coinjar account in the US. They could also create a AU account. That would allow them to pay an invoice to USD using their AUD bank accounts? Then I can move the BTC from Coinjar to Coinbase and withdraw it? Would I still be looking at less fees then 2.9%?

I have never received a tip before, this could be exciting...

My question was whether or not they have to pre-purchase bitcoins in an un-related step to paying with BTC. So they have to already have BTC on hand in order to pay me?
Since the goal is to replace paypal, the ideal setup would be AUD -&gt; BTC -&gt; USD in one step without much intervention from their part. Even better if they can just enter in the invoice amount and click the pay button to initiate it. Paypal makes it pretty easy for them so I would be hoping to keep it simple even if its a few more steps.
Secondly, if it is 3% total fees then its more expensive then Paypal for the total transaction?

So they first have to buy the bitcoins in order to pay me? It can't happen automatically during the time of payment similar to the merchant side of things? I am looking for a somewhat similar flow to what they are used to now. 
They could go to my payment page, type in the amount and it would automatically do the rest for them. Convert to BTC, pay to my wallet, and from my end the automatic withdraw part.

Assuming I could get it to work, with the fees it sounds like it would be 0.01% more expensive or 0.09% cheaper depending on how I setup the account. Either way, at best I am saving $10/yr which is probably not worth the hassle of it all. Hopefully in the future it will become easier to exchange through BTC.

Agreed. I will be on the lookout until then.

Well that was pretty painless! Thanks for the experience!
