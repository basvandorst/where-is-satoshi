I like my money to be just that; money. Not a permission to withdraw from my bank account. That's one reason I like bitcoin for payments.

I don't get the persecution complex in this sub. If anything, the "MainStream Media" has awarded extreme amounts of attention to bitcoin, far beyond what little importance it has had until now, and often with a tone of breathless hype.
That's because bitcoin is a great story, and honestly the sensationalist coverage might be one of the biggest assets it has going for it. Yet is up in arms if there is the slightest mention of pot dispensaries or price volatility and now the whole world is out to get us.

For now it is slightly costlier and a little more of a hassle. But I am happy to go a little out of my way to support something I would like to see succeed.

I feel dumb for asking, but couldn't the seller just pursue the buyer through the regular legal channels? Same like any other vendor who accepts credit card payments and tacks a few percent on top for costs associated with fraudulent chargebacks?

Not directly in support of bitcoin, but plenty that denounce the current monetary system, and not just the part directly mixed up with usury/interest. 
The ones that go the furthest claim that paper notes are not permissible as currency, since they are essentially a debt (owed to you by the government), and there are specific rules governing the passing on of a debt from one person to another. This argument also leans heavily on the (very extensive) traditional legal code surrounding zakat (Islamic tax), which stipulates very precise methods of payment, always in 'real' goods.
There are groups, such as the Murabitun in England, that work towards making Muslims reject the present monetary system and adopt a 'halal' alternative, see f.ex. this book review:
Their alternative, as far as I know, is developing a gold-based currency with an electronic network on top of it. Needless to say, that is quite a mouthful of an undertaking, compared with adopting something like bitcoin.

Thanks for a balanced viewpoint. Too many people here see things in black and white - it reminds me of young fringe political groups (which is probably an accurate description of the bitcoin community). Everything is always good vs. evil, with-me-or-against-me on every issue.

Next stop, the three commas club!

Yup, happened to me too. Savvy sellers know how to string along a complaint until PayPal's time limit expires, then they drop you like a brick.

Alan Greenspan, before he became Fed chairman, stated in no uncertain terms that gold was the only viable way to back currency:

It's actually good news!®
