Read up on BCH, Ripple and Litcoin
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:02:20
I'm with you, I've lost thousands in transactions receiving way less than I should have. They always have excuses and therefore I will cease to do further transactions with them. I'd also just take the money and inform a lawyer and possibly someone that specializes in the crypto subject. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:08:43
Just don't let it get you down or anything, it's just magic internet money after all. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:02:32
Sad but true, interesting to see what will happen when it does get implemented though, you'd think more people will trade around and purchase. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:05:11
You should Google operation dragonslayer it's a myth about whales working together pumping some coins and going all in on another while low crashing the rest. In theory it sounds like it could work, but think about it, if you had half a billion in crypto would you risk it all by pumping something and have a possibility of closing the deal too late? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:55:34
I'll buy it via PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:05:40
Will definitely have an effect, though I think a majority of the investors will hold it out a bit and research. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:40:16
Ew, round up your BTC to 10 please. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:49:06
Not trying to be a dick, but people usually overestimate brandawareness due to them being targeted alot by advertising or hanging with simular people having the same interests. It's hard to estimate how big this really is but I'd guess at least 5% of all people above 20 must have heard of bitcoin somehow. Great research material!
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:43:03
Just bad timing, hold onto it for a week it'll be over that amount again. I'll let you quote me on that later. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:41:29
Hurray. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:27:14
Let's hope, just bought at a low. ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:26
I'll buy it with PayPal 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:05
I'll buy .65 on PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:55:38
Big investors are taking an interest in the big rise aswell as criminals. Surely the daily memes about plebs finding fortune in BTC contributes aswell. :) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:56:27
There's a total of 21 million BTC to be mined, divide all fiat by 21 million and it'd probably be a high number like that. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:56:07
Let's go for 6K my dude
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:05
I'll buy .65 on PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:14:41
I'll wait until it's 10 BTC :-) 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:13:41
It will definitely surpass 5K so just that fraction is bound to make you a 500$ profit in what I suspect will be less than a week. Remember to never get greedy and spare what can be missed! 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:33:47
Welcome to the party 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:56:06
Just buy a portion every week and diversify. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:35:27
If it passes the market cap of gold one day we will all be rich.

I say 3100€ then 3450€ by the end of the day

Money is never too easy, you're either just right on time or lucky. But then again, you make your own luck. Or a panties webshop I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:01:26
Maybe it's just the USD dropping in value
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:36:42
If it's not that much I can do it and transfer, the fees will be bad though. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:31:44
Just got back from work just to start working at home and simultaneously checking BTC since I am also holding bitcoin for my gf and little nephew and don't want to f* up :^) 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:44:25
It's currently at 4085,75USD
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:24:16
Meh. Wake me at €10000
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:28:35
Just buy more? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:13:25
People panic, the supply becomes greater than demand resulting in this. Probably by tomorrow it will be heading towards 4500$ again. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:03:35

@_date: 2017-08-19 15:42:05
My advise, 40% BCC 60% BTC and hold both look back in a month or two. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:18:39
I just turned 4 and bought 20 BTC, double it anyone? Won't regret it! 
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:54:41
It's a shame I only joined a month ago, but I would regret it if it were any later. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:18:59
Would smash

@_date: 2017-08-20 20:52:15
Do you purchase stuff using your safings account? Think about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:52:35
It's already up brother
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:23:33
Let's transfer .3396 to me and even that number for you ;-) but yeah, definitely hold until 4,500$ then perhaps sell half and rebuy if it dips a bit under 4k$?
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:38:27
Is the Ledger Nano hardware wallet any good? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:49:36
Can't argue there
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:59:36
You could report it to the police, rather we send him a hijacker through the mail though. I just can't stand people pulling sh*t like this. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:34:27
If that is so, he is probably in for a rough ride. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:10:01
Great read, fun to see we're almost up 1K again after the article. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:36:47
Very satisfied. Now don't fall below 4K when I go to sleep damn it. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:26:14
Pretty sick concept if you think about it, maybe we should create a currency to purchase stuff with and buy those low and sell H I G H? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:13:49
Yeah, not selling for a while. Bought at 3400 and I feel blessed main. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:28:44
Jesus dude it's a highly fluctuating currency, but therefore also a promising investment. Saying bitcoin is dead tells me you should sell instantly and try not to regret it the coming months. 
Edit: didn't think it was a troll
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:18:49
That's nearly a billion dollars worth, don't think he'd make a video about it.

Someone should have a blimp flying over Wallstreet every week promoting BTC
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:30:19
It's a form of money solely created by the internet. It's practically like gold but easier to trade and with a possibility to grow and be adopted as the earth's new M A G I C C U R R E N C Y
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:47:06
21, lucky number so might aswell risk it all boi
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:03:14
Such a reaction? No one replied? Nothing here adds up are you drunk? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:09:34
I'd say always go with instant exchanges. They have probably every legal right to act like this and unfortunately you and others are the ones left with a decrease in profit. Essentially it won't make much of a difference but please don't support their behavior and leave them when possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:23:32
Damn, hope username checks out :-(
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:46:00
Long term it has proven to be an amazing investment. Also there are tons of places to spend this as a currency which makes it different to investing in stocks since you're actually just holding money, with a rate of interest anyone would die for. Furthermore the community is helpful if you are smart enough to ask and heck, why not take a gamble once instead of regret it later? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:28:16
Nvm had it on gate coin only, I'm the noob at life. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:17:18
I only hold 300$ worth of bitcoin and in just 2 days I'm up more than I expected to in a month. Should I put in another 500$ even though I am a student with limited income or should I wait for it to fall back a bit? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:03
I'll buy .65 on PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:45:07
Definitely yes

@_date: 2017-08-12 18:37:58
Get your grandma to invest, and her friends too! 
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:35:16
I bought another at 4200, I don't think either of us will regret it after tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:41:40
Proud owner of 0,2 BTC Hodl on and don't let go
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:03:50
My question if I were them would be; If your timing is so good, and your fortune so great with a big possibility of it becoming greater the coming months, why even attend college? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:12:24
Yeah I dipped in alright. Dripping BTC bby. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:29:07
Now is the time
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:51:58
Yet you dedicated your time to come here and write this. Seems like somebody wants BTC to dip and buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:39:34
I'd not have sold. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:04:12
More like prepare to empty the bank funds and transfer to BTC
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:02
I'll buy .65 on PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:47:40
Well I'm not an expert but in my lifetime of exchanging currencies on and off I have learned that if bitcoin goes through a dip like this it is often recognized that there has been a Bitcoin ETF Filed with SEC by Leading Gold Fund Manager Vaneck.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:25:25
I've been there bud, bet 1K worth on a site for shits and giggles, actually won, 8 seconds later my funds were 0 and they said my account had been compromised.

@_date: 2017-08-19 15:56:41
No, it's the big boys making some bucks on the commotion around the newborn BCC.
BTC is far from being up to level and is yet to become mainstream. Just keep riding the Rollercoaster and buy some cheap BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:41:10
I just keep it, I'm not too sure how the taxes would impact me. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:55:19
I'll buy it via PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:55:07
Sure take my money
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:58:02
Definitely 
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:10:34
So when I bet 1 BTC on Floyd the return would be 1,1BTC? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:16:30
Alright, cloud bet is trusted? How about fees, would betting small amounts be worth it? Like 250€ 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:46:34
Smart kid
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:19:38
I just turned 4 and bought 20 BTC, double it anyone? Won't regret it! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:16:04
Nice! My dad forgot his watch this morning, the bids on eBay are racking up hope I can get some mBit for it. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:08:27
Finally, we gotta stop playing around fam.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:41:49
That is what I had in mind. Just 2 days sooner.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:16:53
I've overpaid €100+ for some BTC here in the Netherlands. In the long run it doesn't even matter. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:03
I'll buy .65 on PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:30:12
Oh my, could this be the advertisement that got the BTC ball rolling? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:55:24
I'll buy it via PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:04:10
Someone dumping a ton of them would hurt. Also I think selling at highs is quite risky since at any point it could skyrocket and the people left without bitcoins due to selling them at a high would need to repurchase at a higher price point and with transaction fees. But yeah let's hope it don't and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:44:54
Had Bitonic moeten pakken G
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:59:12
Damn man, look on the bright side though, you're still way up there BTC wise. I think you worry too much about your money and became obsessed with it. I'd cash it all to BTC and not look back for at least 2-3 months and perhaps you'll have 200, but worth tripple. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:31:11
Isn't Satoshi still holding like a 100k BTC? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:02
I'll buy .65 on PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:41:54
300 up
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:01:55
Dude if you bought today, no way you should cash out even a month from now. 
Edit: Autocorrect
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:15:05
In the Netherlands it's very easy to go out and buy a beer with it :) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:22:28
Guess I will be buying groceries with mBits
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:17:41
maybe maybe maybe
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:50:32
Please sell now, I will even pay the difference for ya bud. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:02:46
This is great news. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:06:57
But it'll pass 4.000$ within hours
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:03:13
My girlfriend still has no damn clue what a bitcoin is and why I look at these charts more often than her tits. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:10:57
I think we might have passed that station my friend 
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:01:42
It's more about supporting something I believe in and showing how confident I am with this system. Also this saves me fees from buying BTC myself, since I won't ever need to. Also pretty sure I can deduct those costs from taxes. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:46:45
Bitcoin™ ayy
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:43:30
Those numbers are based on? 2000 would be a far cry IMHO.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:39:54
If I got a dollar everytime someone asked this, I'd be able to buy 1000BTC easily. But seriously, look at the charts, get a grasp on how many people still have not even heard of bitcoin. Let alone invest in it. You could always spread out your budget over the course of a few weeks, but I wouldn't wait too long. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:04:37
Sounds like a sweet deal to me
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:41:22
I can do some freelance work, pay me in bitcoin ;-) 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:26:05

@_date: 2017-08-19 19:13:55
Be sure to account for taxes aswell, I'd say sell all the BCC and reinvest a part of that in more BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:20:32
Lol this is prime time to invest. Everyone has money to gain here. Man up and invest in the future you cryptocuck.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:38:09
Won't drop further than this, we're up and away to 5K
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:07:01
Are you sure you are not the one selling these? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:02:42
Lets go for 7777,77
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:25:20
They stated 2 hours they're preparing to resume after an infrastructure outage. Kind of fishy that they don't use email or something to notify. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:56:27
Hey I just bought another full coin, and I am not worried. Here's why: My recent and first coin I bought at 3500, seemed like a huge amount and it had not dipped I just felt like buying. Now it's at 3750 and I feel like it could reach 4K within a week. Check out the chart and zoom out a bit, hodl and don't let go until you are satisfied. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:14:04
I'd say 20-50K is a nice number. Would set my profit to about 10K aswell. God it's hard not to keep throwing money at it and get greedy. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:09:39
I won't disclose all since two of them are niche and dutch user based, though plazmaticlighters.nl is a nice one I'm proud of. In total it has yielded a revenue of ~2200€ in bitcoin. Obviously would be more if retailers would pay in BTC but I assume that won't happen for the coming years. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:08:33
Less than 3

I'll buy .65 on PayPal
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:24:35
But if everyone stops trading gold, it'd surely hold a value still?

@_date: 2017-08-13 08:17:35
Percentage wise it's always best to get in ASAP with what you can miss. With these growths it's dangerous waiting for the price to drop, it might just never do. But surely if you invest together you wouldn't be to late and have a lot of money to be made. FYI I hold 0,5BTC and some other crypto currency since 3 days and have already made over  300€.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:13:15

@_date: 2017-08-30 15:10:57
3 people in my environment alone have over 500K in bitcoin, I think not many people like to risk their insanely quickly accumulated fortune by bringing it up. If so, they could be lying about the amount aswell. My guess would be 7500+
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:44:53
Amen brother
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:49:41
Especially since I had my finger on the trigger to sell at 4300 hoping for a dip. Guess I'll HODL
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:45:19
Would not recommend, invest what you can afford without loans. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:59:01
Will have someone look into this, what country you in? Smaller amounts are unavailable outside of Europe due to transaction fees and shipping eating up profit
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:45:37
It went up since yesterday though? Baboon. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:12:23
I know the Dutch sites have a €20k limit you could try that, I'd imagine there would be struggle with banking though. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:45:56
I'm using coinomi, I have written down the wallet words but when I checked the keys, there's a shit ton of them compared to the transactions I made, just write them all down? And how to recover if the worst was to happen? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:26:33
So how would they guess my password and 12 word sentence? Caution is great but if you are taking this spying as a legitimate threat you might aswell never wire money anymore on mobile devices. Would like to see what others think, or what actions others take for protection though. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:38:48
Lmao, 'careful investing'. Remind me to never take them seriously again and send them a postcard from my future house at the beach. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:27:50
21K is going interstellar
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:14:06
I'll always hold a certain pecantage in BTC, buying extra is always an option if BTC were to hit a low but I expect it to go up again about 1 day before the activation of Segwit (4 Days and 4 hours?). Don't worry my child. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:53:22
You keep the river flowing my friend
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:56:27
I'll buy it with PayPal

I think miners have decided to switch lanes for now. Resulting in BTC users to be left with horrible fees and transaction times. This leads to an increasing amount of BCC users which effictively could lead to Bitcoincash being the leading cryptocurrency. I'd watch out with your investments if I were you. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:38:27
Sorry dude, thought people would figure it out in the given context. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:51:25
How does it not matter? Obviously this can and will happen again and again and again, the miners have complete control. If this continues we might aswell stop using cryptocurrency or not call it a currency at all. The whole point was that crypto would be decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:27:35
It will go lower. I'd say wait for BTC to drop a bit, put 100 on BCC, then put the rest on BTC on Monday. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:29:46
Wait so it will decrease? Why is everyone at r/BTC talking about the flippening then? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:34:00

@_date: 2017-11-11 13:06:21
Talking about the insane amount of coins being forked and the stupidity of the community to not stand for it. Obviously BTC should be ahead for many reasons, BCC has its benefits short term and thus people hop over. Not thinking about how this affects the future of BTC in the coming year(s). If I had never invested in crypto, I definitely wouldn't after seeing this clash. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:30:16
Don't buy BCC, put it all on BTC on Monday or earlier if BTC pulls back above 6500

Crypto = BTC, BTC = Crypto
The world is getting familiar with blockchain technology and the first thing they link to it is BTC. Therefore it's likely it will remain the runner up for years to come. 
Would just as happily be proven wrong though.

BCC has the biggest potential to grow 200% this week, albeit due to some criminal developers, it's bang for your buck though. Myself I wouldn't risk more than 10% of my portfolio on it.

Very possible, but don't think it will drop significantly more like today.

Don't see it crashing? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:15:55
Uhm, not all currencies are in a downwards spiral. Also less volatility and banks are generally well constructed and safe. Unlike BTC where there's fear of hacks and imagine being an elderly woman and having to pay for some groceries with BTC. Though I have to say if you never purchased your BTC you either don't get the concept or are in it for the money solely. The more we spend, the more mainstream it gets. This will lead to further development and we could soon be looking at smoother, quicker and easier transactions at lower costs. Which will attract bigger players to accept it and so forth.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:47:45

After the dust from the China FUD settles, I'd say within 20-30 days. We might see some spikes where they will take their profits 
making it gradually drop again. Hoping for a 4500$ Bitcoin near the end of October. But then again, there's another hard fork on its way which could set us back alot.

If I had hodled this amount of BTC I'd have less value as of right now. Now I have more BTC and am in a profit zone. What did I miss? 
If you're thinking a few coins will buy you a yacht in the coming years you'll be in for a surprise very likely. BTC is not a widespread currency yet, nor does it have any intrinsic value to fall back on. If next year the majority decides big saggy nutcoin is the cryptocurrency to adopt, we can and will.
I'm not trying to bring anyone down, but hodling to me contradicts the purpose of the entire concept of BTC. At least if you do, spend some and top it off. I trade primarily for fun, I don't see myself or anyone else with less than 100K invested becoming a millionaire with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:56:11

Got 0,5 BTC a few years back from school. It was a huge project and it was for you to purchase a beer with BTC in town or on the campus. Wish I had collected more, but then again, they'd probably be beer in my eyes the minute I left the campus. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:35:50
There's no way to cheat it, the process is explained upon checking out when you select BTC payment. And once a transaction is sent, there's really no way to retrieve it. I work with a plugin, depends on your CMS you should check out BitPay. Only issue is returning payments, this has to be done with fiat usually or via my private wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:08:40

I have been investing in multiple cryptocurrencies for a long time, and believe me; when BTC gets sold by big investors, the price of not only BTC but basically all alt-coins drops. I can also say that in the past I have never been disappointed to buy in a dip like this. Neither will the investors when they buy back their coins 5% cheaper.
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:32:01
Really quite a shame the dip has to be timed like this, would have loved the donations to be worth more. Nonetheless hope we raise a solid amount.

I saw an opportunity a while ago, grabbed it, and here I am with a few hundred thousand people that see the ship sinking. I myself have faith we will recover, albeit perhaps not until mid October. One thing I'm upset about is how I got people to join in in my excitement and now they're seeing these losses. I can recover myself, but can hardly recover their damages. I even bought up my friends' BTC a bit overpriced because he was getting depressed over it.

You shouldn't ask this in a sub where everyone invests heavily in cryptocurrency, BTC specifically. I'd say diversify, but I personally don't think Facebook has that much of a growth left. I'd say social media platforms have a limited lifespan, but they're advertising right? Thing is if people switch platforms, their advertisements are worth jack. I don't know man but I'd say look at the charts, you're a bit late on both parties but I think BTC has the most beer left for a good time.

To see your BTC paper wallet holdings go to this URL and search for your PUBLIC Address - DO NOT TYPE IN THE PRIVATE KEY from your paper wallet. 
Use this URL to see your BCH wallet holdings. 
A wallet is a piece of software to manage addresses on the blockchain. The wallet could be web-based or it could be software on your PC/MAC/Phone. A paper wallet isn't really a wallet, it's just a piece of paper describing the address, its contents and the private keys necessary to support ownership. Never let anyone you don't trust see those private keys, that includes webcams, phones, anything.

To be honest man, hodling is not always the right decision. If anything like the recent news pops up and the sources people with BTC check start spreading more uncertainty and doubt, you just know we're in for a heavy drop. No need to speculate.
At this point, why would you not sell, accelerate the process and wait out until you are comfortable buying back in? Here's where things get tricky, you don't want to get back in too late. That's why you either A: Set some buying orders at different lows, the lower the price the more BTC you put in the buy order. Or B: Watching the market closely and dollar cost average over the course of some hours or days, depends on how unstable the market gets. 
Last dip I lost a few K due to holding on, decided it's time to cut losses and hope my buy orders fulfill and wait till a recovery. All my buy orders fulfilled at the 3K mark and overall I now have more bang for my buck.
Disclaimer: Don't try this as a newcomer,  at smaller FUD dips or purely out of emotion or wanting to make back losses. Set a budget, margins, strategy. Bought the dip? Keeps dipping? Then you hodl.

I've been on the brink of selling a portion for a while now to pay some taxes, but with these increases it'd be wiser to take a penalty on the taxes than to pay it.

BTC seems to be doing well these days
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:00:24
'hodling' shares of anything, without continuing to investigate the market would be unwise and I think big traders are aware of that. But I can imagine losing 100K in a matter of minutes can have a big psychological impact, takes guts and knowledge to get through these dips but in the end BTC has always come back with a vengeance. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:33:30
Well considering in 2014 I believe BTC was like 700-800$ lowest, someone would have repitatively sent hundreds of thousands in BTC to you without noticing the error. I don't think anyone handling such cash would risk it by doing a sh*t job. True or not though, cash out at least 50% and invest in real estate, upgrade your life standards and keep the rest for the fork.

That's great, will definitely post my idea soon. Though it is kind of more offline than online.. the idea being the creation of big BTC graffiti artworks across the world at high traffic hotspots. Together with other artists we will be telling a story about Bitcoin and illustrating the future in these artworks. Ofcourse this could go hand in hand with some online marketing and possibly a quality video (or short ad) on YouTube and social media. But the idea is to kind of let the people do the work, like Banksy did. The money would go to research for placement and creation of a multitude of triggering artworks and ofcourse supplies and a small contribution to the artists. 
Excited to see other ideas, definitely think these kind of things can help us blast off to the moon, we just need to get our heads together.

@_date: 2017-09-13 10:39:30
I would do the same but alts grow exponentially when BTC goes up so I'd be selling at a way lower rate than I could get if I waited out the dip. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:03:34
Adding to this, it didn't even drop more than we gained this week so idk what your deal was?

Just because I have to; All these people could have easily lost money here, not on this transaction particularly but by selling before, buying back higher and now at am ATH trying to recover the losses. Thing is by selling now they're possibly making the same mistake. Or they just made a ton of money after drunkbuying some BTC a week ago, let's hope for the latter!

As long as everyone thinks it's a pyramid scheme we will never hit mainstream or a stage of acceptance. We will not be so firmly set in society that it doesn't even seem out of place like fiat, phones and cars. Our number one goal should be educating, and after that it should be distributing and making the coins usable for smaller purchases and possibly reward people that actually use BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:53:20

I saw an opportunity a while ago, grabbed it, and here I am with a few hundred thousand people that see the ship sinking. I myself have faith we will recover, albeit perhaps not until mid October. One thing I'm upset about is how I got people to join in in my excitement and now they're seeing these losses. I can recover myself, but can hardly recover their damages. I even bought up my friends' BTC a bit overpriced because he was getting depressed over it.

Would definitely help out, being a lighter distributor we have noticed a huge spike in BTC payments this year. Easy payments with the transaction fees as of right now just beg for a 'Pay with BTC' marketing campaign. I'll check out the reddit once I get to the office.

Fly over to an expert and set up a contract so there's no way to screw you over. If you don't act now you will possibly never recover these beauties. You could write a script that will match up these passwords with the keys you have found and possibly (in a few days) you are in.

You're definitely right, thanks for not bashing anyone here. To be honest this month will be of few trades for me. The market is even more unstable than usual and even though I have a hunch it will descent from here on until October I will probably hold on to everything and buy in every other day. Hope we both continue to make the right decisions in the future!
