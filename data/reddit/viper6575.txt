I'm not a financial advisor, but I would consider 3 to triple profits.

Why would making money be a waste of time. 10k to 15k fiat is Bitcoin at 25k which many believe will happen in 2018.

Good reminder. I am Hodl'ing and picked up a Ledger. 
Just haven't got around to transferring.  Will do tomorrow.

I sold at 10,500. I guess I just had to learn my lesson on my own til I could truly become a HODLer. I'm back in at 12k.
To the moon!

Maybe you are and maybe you aren’t.
Coinbase is extremely easy but you pay for it in fees and only 2 alts are available.  So once you make your first purchase then do your research and find ways to save yourself by using other exchanges or the Coinbase to GDAX transfers that have been covered in many posts here.

If it's your first time in a sushi restaurant go with the salmon (Bitcoin). If you really like it then try the eel or octopus (alts).

If it gets to 9k it will rally to 10k. 
Then expect a dip to 9.8 or 9.7.  
That would be a good dip to buy in.

All depends on if USD is still around by end of 2018

Nobody has a clue what the price will be and its past performance may or may not be an indicator. 
Most on this sub are bullish but short term gains would just be a guess.

Buy High
Go Higher!
