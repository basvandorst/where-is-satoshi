@_date: 2019-06-17 18:19:11
Right lol, this is definitely no where near the ultimate peak . You’re good man. Invest via DCA , at least 1k every 2 weeks
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:36:36
Well I only do because I believe there will be a great reward for them and I wante them to enjoy it also
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:58:51
I’m with you there, I should’ve bought when it was at 3.5k but I wanted to wait and if doesn’t go down I might miss my ride to the moon 
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:19:54
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:37:21
Maybe if the price goes to 1 million it could happen
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:30:51
You’re a good friend dude
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:01:24
Instead of having Buffalo Wild Wings play sports on the tv , they should have one tv dedicated to bitcoin during bull runs ��
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:05:51
You made my day ��
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:28:08
I literally get into arguments with my friends and family about me trying to teach them about bitcoin and they simply don’t care at all. I find it very amusing, my cousin told me that he doesn’t care about getting rich, he’s got a comfortable living and could care less for btc.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:17:09
You smart lol, but right now we are in a bull market so this is perfect for a retrace in the market
@_date: 2019-02-26 07:41:03
Kinda like wechat and alipay?
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:12:20
No I understand the binance US part, I read somewhere that coinbase will have to require everyone who withdraws more than $1k to give their personal information otherwise they’ll not be allowed to withdraw the money.
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:29:20
They’ll blame you for not telling them to buy, that’s just how it works every time lol.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:00:11
Dude seriously ��
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:44:13
Y’all crack me up ��. Made my day 
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:16:38
Dude same thing happened to me but I sold at 5.8k thinking I would go down to 4.9k and it never did. Last night I was contemplating buying it at 7.1k and woke up and it was 7.8k lol. I’m traumatized, I don’t want to miss out.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:04:43
If bitcoins dumps altcoins go up ����
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:31:55
Did he say were having a retrace after this pump?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:17:20
Haha good one ����
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:10:30
;) haha One scare is good enough lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:41:50
I’m going to get a glass of water, sure was intense lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:33:15
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:39:17
I’m sorry dude, must suck. This is the first time I have one like this. I guess because I’m so involved in this space that it’s actually actually affecting me.
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:23:49
I wish I was as smart as you, missed 3.8k and instead bought at 8k. That FOMO got to me man
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:00:47
���� you’re already part of the group. Congrats
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:50:28
Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:22:38
Thanks for the advice and info. I’ll try to see if there’s a possible dip as well.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:40:09
Did he say to take profits at 9k?
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:50:30
Do you happen to have the link where you bought your wallets from?
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:57:03
I felt that lol. I’m watching a stream live right now. Looks like we’re going up
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:36:35
Nice, I’ll start watching his videos. We’re able to take a good position with this pump?
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:04:18
I feel you dude, I’ll be pissed off as well. I actually had two bitcoins and sold thinking it would go down. Biggest mistake ever
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:57:15
Whoever made this is a genius 
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:52:45
�� Yah I should just put my house loan in there and see what happens jk. Which hard wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2018-12-27 03:24:23
The cookie knows 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:52:37
My brain just exploded 
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:39:15
Have you had this dream too? :o
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:50:28
Is this on pc or app?
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:28:16
I also bought through coinbase because its a simple process but I seriously hate their fees. For some reason too I’ve noticed that the price it shows in the main screen is totally different when you try to purchase a bitcoin and you get to the checkout
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:13:21
We’re in this together ����
