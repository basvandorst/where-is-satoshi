Think he means a channel directly between the 2 parties that are transacting over LN. The point being you won't be opening and pre-funding a channel directly with Joe's coffee shop to buy coffee (the gift card model). You'll be opening a channel with a highly-connected node that will enable off-chain payments / receipts with the majority of the Lightning economy (the credit card model, minus the suck)

That sucks, I'm sorry that happened to you :-/
In the future (and in case anyone is reading this who might benefit), always make sure you verify the PGP signature of the download executable before you install and use a wallet like Electrum.
In the case of Electrum, I would suggest first getting the author's PGP signature from the GitHub repository, so you aren't relying on a single site to link to the author's signature and the downloaded executable.
This is a pain to do if you haven't ever done it before, but it is unfortunately necessary.

Meh... Electrum is open source, so while I agree it would be better if they used the standard, I have a hard time getting too worked up about it.

Do you currently have an unconfirmed transaction that you sent from your Mycelium wallet by chance? I haven't used Mycelium, but my best guess is a portion of your total Bitcoin balance is an unspent output in an unconfirmed transaction. 
If this is the case, you won't be able to spend that portion until the transaction confirms. 
Might want to actually understand what you're doing when you send a transaction before you start making wild-ass accusations.

Nope, difficulty adjustment isn't based on 2 weeks, but rather a set number of blocks. If 95% of hashrate quit, block creation would slow by 95%, and the next difficulty re-target wouldn't occur for many months. It wouldn't be good, but the network would eventually adjust to the new hashrate.

If a receiving address was sufficient to allow access to the funds stored in a wallet, then anyone who had your receiving address would be able to spend your Bitcoin. You need to find your private key, or your Bitcoin is gone.
Do you remember what wallet program you used to store the bitcoin initially?

Yes, but (I'm not a cryptographer so don't take this as gospel) it's also a function of entropy. All 128-bit keys are not created equal. The entropy of the seed is itself a function of the size of the alphabet, it's length, and how randomly it is chosen. You can think of each word in the word list as a character in the alphabet used to create the seed phrase, so a 12-word seed created from a smaller word list has less entropy than a 12-word seed created from a larger word list, and is less secure as a result.

I hear you. You might consider using an old version of a minimal Ubuntu install, say lubuntu 12.04, which would minimize the amount of packages installed on the machine, and, more importantly, would have been created before the rise of crypto, which should give you some comfort regarding embedded crypto-stealing malware. This might cause some difficulties installing Electrum, however, if it needs newer versions of dependencies than are available in the 12.04 repos.

I think you were on the right track. You could use something like a raspberry pi zero ($5, with no wifi), but any old PC will do just fine for cold storage.
Don't worry about physically disabling the wifi, just install a fresh copy of Ubuntu linux, connect to your home wifi, and run a "sudo apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade" to update all the software on the machine.
Then install Electrum's dependancies via "sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pyqt5 python3-pip"
Then download the latest version of Electrum with: "wget 
Then verify the downloaded file with PGP and ThomasV's public key (google verify file signature pgp if you need help with this): 
Then forget your wifi network, and completely disable wifi on the machine via network manager. You will never connect to the internet again on this machine.
Finally, install the downloaded &amp; verified copy of Electrum via "sudo pip3 install /path/to/electrum/Electrum-3.0.2.tar.gz"
Now you're good to use this machine as cold storage.

They cover a limited number of transactions per month, I think 25. So it can't really be abused to any significant extent.

Because it's not a calculation of the amount of money required sitting under your mattress to last you until you die. It's a calculation of how much principle is required, invested and earning x% interest per year (4% in the example), to live your current lifestyle on interest alone, indefinitely, never touching the principle.

I'd suggest leaving them in bread. You control the keys so it's much more secure, and bread has committed to doing both sides of future forks.

Jesus Christ, this post title. I get that people have strong opinions about the future of Bitcoin, but am I the only person who doesn't want my wallet to make a political statement? Wallets have a specific function -- store funds, and when the time comes to spend the funds, facilitate that spending. I want access to both sides of any and all hypothetical future forks, regardless of what side I fall in the political / ideological debate surrounding the forks.
I get that there are practical considerations surrounding supporting every potential Tom, Dick, or Harry that decides to fork a cryptocurrency, but given two otherwise identical wallets, I think the wallet that allows me to access the highest percentage of the value stored in it is better.
This should be every wallet's goal, in my opinion -- it is in the interests of their users. There may be plenty of valid reasons to demonize Bitpay and their actions in the crypto space, but their implementation of a feature that gives users access to more of the value stored in their wallets is not one of them.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:58:23
Well if you want to choose sides you can choose your node in bread I believe. But if you're a non-technical user, best to hold off on transactions until you get a blog post from bread explaining their implementation of the forked currency. 
With Bitcoin Cash, they implemented a "withdraw all BCH" feature that made it easy. 
Future forks may or may not have replay protection so you need to make sure you know all potential repercussions on both sides of a fork before broadcasting a transaction on one side.
If you hold in a wallet that will support both sides of the fork, and wait to transact until they implement the new currency, you can be sure you won't get lose access to some of the value in your wallet.

Here's a ridiculously simplified example. 
Imagine the Bitcoin protocol, by design, allowed for the storing of a balance of Bitcoin at any of 100 addresses. These addresses are just locations where a balance can be stored, and for this example we'll say they are address 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,... 100. When I send Bitcoin, I broadcast a transaction that informs the network that I want to send 5 Bitcoin to address, say, 77. The network does it's thing, and now the public ledger (block chain) records a balance of 5 Bitcoin at address 77. 
Notice this address, 77, didn't have to be "created", it's just a numeric representation of one possible location among the universe of possible addresses where Bitcoin can be stored. To spend the Bitcoin residing at address 77, I have to prove "ownership" of that address, by providing the secret keys that were used to select that address in the first place. In this example, 77 was chosen because it is the product of the two primes 7 and 11. By providing 7 and 11, I am proving that I "own" address 77. 
In reality, your Bitcoin address is an extremely large number, but it is nevertheless within the universe of possible numbers that can be used as addresses (just like 1-100 in the above example). So there is no requirement to "register the address". Additionally, your private key (7 and 11 in the example), are likewise numbers that were used to choose your address, and can be used to prove that you control the address, but cannot be easily derived from the address.

Once your wallet is updated, move your funds to an HD deterministic wallet like Copay or Electrum and you're done. Only have to do it once. As for backups, with an HD deterministic wallet you will only need to store a seed phrase that will allow full wallet recovery in the future.

With the sale of stocks, there are 3 commonly used methods, of which you would pick one. 
FIFO (first in, first out), meaning the oldest purchase would be sold first. This will commonly result in the largest realized capital gain and tax liability.
Average cost. Exactly what it sounds like. Calculate the average purchase price across all your lots and that is the price from which you calculate your capital gain/loss.
Specific identification. "On 6/7/17 I sold 5 of the shares purchased on 2/12/15." This gives you the most flexibility but you better have good records.
