Been hearing it willl correct since $8k, and hearing again at $10k.
I don’t think it’ll correct unless there are news/events/rumors. Since June when it was $2k, it never went down except 3 times. 2 were hard forks, 1 China regulation news. Drops happen in Crypto with a news, so there will be news in the near future which can trigger the correction, otherwise Buy, Buy approach will be pumped.
Tl dr, bitcoin needs news and events to go down, otherwise its not correcting itself.

Who's the best singer though?

The perception I have is that most of the money coming into the game are small amounts to stay. Everybody think that bitcoin in a couple of years will hit 100K and for this reason, people are pumping savings (small amounts) not for trading but for a long-term position.

It won’t. Because I’ll buy some and it will crash

It's true that my balance in USD is decreasing, but my bitcoin balance hasn't changed since I bought it. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:13:30
Haha yep

This is the best reply, thank you man. I plan to add money every week. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:06:20
Everyone kept saying buy now and bitcoin will increase in 10 years, however my balance is already increasing from the first day, and probably losing .
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:40:04
