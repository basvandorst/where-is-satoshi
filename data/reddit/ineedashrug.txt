Without ALM/KYC practices and whatever comes next, the interfaces to BTC, i.e. regulated bank accounts, will no longer be permitted meaning it will be difficult to gain mass adoption. People have to buy BTC.. while you CAN get paid in BTC, mass adoption won't likely come that way

The point was retail or "on the fly" acquisition of BTC. For people buying through an exchange will have lower fees but they are subject to the volatility. For consumers who don't want to bare that risk, they are usually hit with higher commissions or built in higher prices (ATM, Credit Card purchases or BTC). Again, this is an argument about consumer appeal, not the .001 of the population that's getting paid completely in BTC

Excellent use of your debate skills- jumping straight into expletives. Never did I say bankers are inherently evil. What I said is there is a systemic issue. The system itself obscures the wrong doing. If you think Bitcoin is a scam, quit wasting your time trying to save the world from Bitcoin.

It's only available to Payment Hub clients of Paypal. It's currently just digital merchants, ebooks, videos, games, etc.

Seriously dude, you should try a constructive comment or two once in your Reddit life and stop being so damn jaded. In reading your comment history I see nothing but attempts to belittle people. Are you that self conscious that you must tear everyone down to make yourself feel intellectually superior? Grow the hell up.

Apple Pay doesn't disrupt the existing payment system, it changes the user experience and reduces the risk of identity theft. That's not disruption. Apple Pay will ADD to the cost structure of the existing system. 
It will raise the awareness of mobile payments, which is good for bitcoin. I agree it will make one of the consumer benefits of bitcoin less apparent because the Apple Pay PARTICIPATING merchant (keyword) will not have their card data for those consumers. It won't stop the headlines though because less than 5% of merchants will be in the launch and a small fraction of consumers will be on the vanguard.

It's done by the BitPay payment engine at the time you go to checkout

As more liquidity comes in and additional services are developed, real derivative products, the volatility will likely not be as pronounced. Interest rates can on BitCharge would also likely be dramatically less that the 18% on credit cards because the infrastructure costs, reduced fraud, etc.

Dude, what is systemic, the other is an example of bad actors which exist in any ecosystem.

In the US I can convert Bitcoin to gift cards instantly and spend it at retailers for basic needs. Very soon, I will also be able to pay my rent and utilities. Of course it's not all roses, we'd all like to see let volatility to people are more comfortable with it as a store of value, but to suggest that I can only buy luxury items is just wrong.

It's not "a way to create a network", IT IS a network. And earlier in the interview he lays out the case for why Bitcoin will eventually win..."Those of us that participate in the token infrastructure can make decisions on who you want to give access to..." Um, no thanks we'll use this one of here, thanks though.

NO doubt. Napster was put out of business because of the rights of the owners of the product they allowed, encouraged on their platform. They were a business. It's better to write a story, "Was Mt. Gox Napster".

Depends on your ecommerce application. Shopify supports that and supports BitPay invoices.

I don't believe Apple has opened up the NFC device libraries. So, until Apple does that NFC with bitcoin will only be Android.

Yeah, all the attorneys that operate at the SEC know LOTS about computer security and they are experts in uncovering fraud.... riiiiiiiiight. We're not there yet but services like BitReserve will provide a template for real transparency the likes of which you'll never find in the crony capitalist world of JP Morgan and Goldman.
