How does that work and is it viable? Do you think users, core, and miners realize this?

Wished the people would focus the discussion on this instead of witch hunting 
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:20:31
So people are doing that now? And this is good and we should see some pathway to resolution soon?
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:10:58
that works too!

It's just rumor right now.

I like your stlye! Bringing ferosh bitcoin rap and knows his shit about that ol' school coin. If I was a millionaire I'd totally tipbot you!

Just curious, why would you not respect such a request. If it was him, you have got to understand why he would like to remain anon, and why would you want to potentially cause him/her grief? If it was a troll, then what purpose does the post serve, really. Troll or not you've got to feel stronger one way towards an answer for your questions.

20mins after posting this, my deposit was confirmed and all funds are available to me on Bitfloor. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:33:04
Thanks! I have been studying **the** Photoshop for many years. I gave it everything I had.

I have quite a bit $ tied up as well. I don't care in what 'official' medium the message comes by. I want a plan for my funds being returned.

Just for caution I'll share my current situation:
I deposited several hundred USD &gt;12 hrs ago and have not been credited.
In fairness, a support email from LocalTill was answered basically saying they are experiencing delays and  has since posted several tweets acknowledging LocalTill deposits are being delayed. When creating a deposit transaction on Bitfloor's website then and now they are failing to tell people this information. :/
I've used LocalTill --&gt; Bitfloor flawlessly over 3x in the past month. I am confident as their support says, my deposit will eventually be credited. I don't like I wasn't forewarned though. 
Because of past flawless (nearly instant) LocalTill --&gt; Bitfloor transactions, I will probably use the service again in the future and do like the trading platform better than MtGox. Hopefully they can resolve these type of errors in the future.

I like the way you are thinking and hope you pursue/share this.

This is the answer.

Even better there exists grey market trading for this exact thing. He likely wont ever touch those funds. People watch those addresses like hawks. Any movement from them would spur panic and massive sell offs, crashes... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:55:55
good post
@_date: 2013-06-23 15:06:28
I used it in September 2012 for an Amazon for BTC trade for $50 USD. It was flawless and as far as I know has been in business since then. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:07:14
I feel like I read somewhere there were a few addresses that people liked to watch for this reason. I can't find it now though. The idea might be from the blog comments linked from the following post (which by the way the reddit discussion got pretty interesting and I'd advise reading).
Also if address speculation is fun for you to read (obviously I enjoy it) then this guys analysis and graphs are superb.
Sorry I couldn't deliver a 'single address to watch' for you as my previous post eluded. I must have confused all I've read or just can't find it right now.

i apparently had you tagged as 'crypto smarty' from a thread long ago.
glad to see you are still holding the title!

My Twin? :(
I only invested what I could lose. I made smart trades. Met verifications. secured logins/wallets. And well, I lost it all. Although I'm not in a financial bind or anything, I just don't have more to 'lose' right now. Which sucks, because I LOVE BTC. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:12:52
Thanks &amp; for your replies. I am now the proud owner of 44 [TAT.ASICMINER]( shares &amp; 2 [GSDPT]( shares. I picked the second one because I had some change left over and because well, PROFIT!!?!!
Also just so I got it straight:
* ASICMINER - Direct share controlled by Friedcat that is not available to be purchased anymore (outside of current holders on [Bitcointalk Forums](
* ASICMINER-PT - a "pass through" share representing 1 direct share. No voting rights but can be traded 1/month for an actual direct share. Can be bought various places such as: [BTCT.TO]( or [BitFunder]( or [Havelock Investments]( Also, if bought at btc.to there is no 5% management fee on dividend payouts.
* TAT.ASICMINER - 1/100 of 1 ASICMINER-PT share. No voting right and cannot be transferred to PT or direct shares. Can be purchased at [BTCT.TO]( There is also a 5% management fee for dividend payouts.
Direct shares &amp; PT shares are directly correlated and dividends pay out Wednesdays. As pointed out the PT/Direct and TAT.ASICMINER shares fluctuate and aren't necessarily related to each other (not quite sure why this is though).
