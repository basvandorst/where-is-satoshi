@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:44

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:56:58
At $5500 on November 12.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:56
We are in uncharted territory now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:53:10
this is nothing lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:39
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:09:21
No it didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:27:45
convince your parents to re-mortgage the house, then put all the spare cash into crypto
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:38:15
$13k today for sure
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:54:56
GDAX is losing its shit lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:08:52
I know you're desperate for karma, but no.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:43:23
Literally just a bragging thread.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:06
You should sell everything now. Bitcoin clearly isn't for you.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:16:12
1. Buy Bitcoin
2. HODL
3. Profit

@_date: 2017-11-09 12:06:09
wtf did i just read?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:05:55
That was like $400 in 5 minutes lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:54:52
You can't change the past.
I'd have at least 10 bitcoins if I'd kept everything I ever bought. Instead I spent them on the darknet, and now I only have 0.1.
C'est la vie.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:52:57
Never buy at an ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:40:10
$7180 on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:07:27
I bought at $5500 just 17 days ago, and it's already doubled. Feels good man.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:36
Those options lol. Most people here have less than 1.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:33:18
I have 0.14 BTC. Won't sell for at least 5-10 years. Will buy more if it crashes.
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:19:53
Twitter is and has always been garbage.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:43:08
Buy and hold forever.
A bitcoin could be worth a million dollars one day.

@_date: 2017-11-26 17:08:22
H O D L
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:11:14
I hope it drops further. I want to buy more before it climbs to $10k and beyond.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:01:52
Finally, I was waiting for a sub-$7k dip.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:09:25
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:07:30
Already over $7.3k. WTF
edit: $7.4k just 5 minutes later!
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:06:03


@_date: 2017-11-08 20:33:34
Yes, you should dump all your savings into Bitcoin immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:39:38
there we go
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:17:33
5% is nothing
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:03
Yes. It will be worth one jillion dollars in twenty years time.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:13:52
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:46:15
As always, only invest as much as you can afford to lose.
Bitcoin has gone up more than 700% since last year. There's no reason it couldn't happen again.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:49:31
I'm using coinbase in the UK.
