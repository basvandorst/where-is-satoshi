maybe they decentralize their databases or other core function of business by runining stuff on their really great nodes and providing blockchain structure and binaries etc. and client software of course. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 11:51:16
Well. Guys. What do you specificaly dont like about my sugestions?
@_date: 2015-12-18 11:49:55
Bring masternodes to bitcoin. And repair fungibility of bitcoin. It will make it best coin there is.
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:31:38
I use Uneddit
 as well as other guys there.
So welcome.

Hi Halfhand,
Since I came to bitcoin the reason for me to believe in bitcoin sucess was the fact that bitcoin could implement every good line of code that other coins have. That is something that makes bitcoin the best cryptocurrency. Yet the truth is bitcoin has to do it to stay on top. Looking for an answer how other cryptocurrencies function is definitely a duty of every good bitcoin enthusiast.
I would rather hear from you how did you come to conclusion that I have malicous intentions?
But in your (flawed) logic even mining is centralization of bitcoin. 
Masternodes in dash cryptocurrency are heavily regulated and when they pass the quality test then they gain by serving everyone. Masternodes there are having lot of important functions and they decentralize by being in greater numbers than bitcoin nodes that are not incentivized. Dash had great increase in masternode amount. You do have to lock 1000 DASH to have a masternode. This is another great idea. 
**It means that if you want to attack the network then you will definitely have to buy a great amounts of cryptocurrency and you will end up making it even scarcer and incentivizing everyone to rather not sell or even promote adoption.** 
Because cryptocurrencies are usualy getting stronger with higher price comes greater interest and with greater interest come greater adoption and with it come greater price. Sure that supply/demand plays its role but this is a mechanism we could have seen in bitcoin space
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:59:38
yeah sorry thanks
@_date: 2015-12-26 00:12:43
definitely, we need to incentivize them and we will be very sucesfull with creating algoritms that incentivized nodes gets they incentive coins just when they behave the best way. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:33:18
Hi, you have my support. 
Very recently I made very similiar submission and I was downvoted heavily.
**Bitcoin needs nodes to stay decentralized**
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:39:22
and only about 12.5 milion is already mined
@_date: 2014-10-21 07:35:12
If it was not able to make somenone make money on differencies between BTC and FIAT. What would be benefits of bitcoin? Bitcoin will not make people wealthy when it is already mainstream - so I will definitely be using BTC after it is mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:38:05
but it will be effective in APRIL. too late isn't it? And it is likely just for Canada.
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:40:49
No. People were talking about GOX as risky place months before its end. Only mainstream media made different interpretations. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:40:45
It is not ban. You just can't use Bitcoin (by law) as a means of payment. Like you probably can't use gold for paying food etc. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:48:28
Fuck the virtual currency (the dollar is so much virtual, as well as other FIAT money, bitcoin is backed by math, and everyone knows that math exists). We are Bitcoin. We are cryptocurrency, we are real, we are digital. 
And 'Magic Internet Money' as well!
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:52:03
yeah, and that's great. But we are talking about Ukraine
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:31:54
Guys, stop using these big exchanges only as they might be new GOXES. Do not get goxed. Start using good ones as well. Diversify credit risk. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:20:44
yeah. you do not even have all exchanges listed.  is fully legal runing exchange. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:50:49

@_date: 2015-07-14 09:13:10
They want you to join some reward cards currency or something. Now this is scam.  You have to pay for registration to that scammy program.
Their currency is not liquid, fungible, limited in supply, regulated or decentralized. It is pure bullshit.
Beware of Walstreet daily.
BTW: I am not having it as add when using bing to search for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:59:22
lol. this will not kill bitcoin. 
@_date: 2012-08-15 17:26:26
Everything works fine for me
@_date: 2012-10-03 10:29:32
That is the next phase of btc that we are getting closer. There are still deficit in case of obtaining bitcoin. We need more exchanges and more ways to get them. However this is getting better as time flows.

Macquarie’s dilemma in the first place. It in effect has a fixed money supply, “bringing with it all the associated problems of money hoarding, deflation and depression historically associated with fixed currencies”, the report says. 
Look at the quotation marks. 
@_date: 2012-12-16 20:22:09
 and you can seriously google anyting.  - for question works very well
@_date: 2012-09-30 19:51:18
It is called a speculation. I know that it is helpful. When selling at spikes you make the bubbles smaller and less painful. You also make the fair price. I think there is slightly great amount of them in our economy and while the work on its own they are generaly helpful. Until there is single entity with control over the whole money, then it is a problem.

Unfortunately, media  are paid by those who are related closely to those who owns banks in majority of cases. We - the normal people can do our best with promoting this currency. 
@_date: 2012-07-28 14:10:57
This is scam. You will be able to get enough BTC after very very long time. And only if you earn at least 0,9 BTC. So this sucks
@_date: 2012-07-25 18:11:42
You can look here 
@_date: 2012-10-06 11:20:52
Whatsover, it is the needed and helpful centralization. Like your body represent your whole complex being, the bitcoin foundation represents the whole comunity against whole world. Bitcoin can have some integration! And even stay decentralized in its key parts.

They stole our natural rights, and we have our solution. It is fud, nothing less than propaganda. We the people want true in articles. That is our fight
@_date: 2012-07-14 10:07:34
Well. That is the true sorry for the inaccurate tittle. 
@_date: 2012-08-25 17:24:22
Nope. It is definitely possible, but at hugh costs and without any meaning as the new bitcoin can be developed and maintained further in the time. If there is mining company that has 51+% it is serious problem but we can and we take defensive actions. And like in economy there is really well working invisible hand which is making everyone to protect bitcoin in their own selfish interest
@_date: 2012-08-17 20:46:46
@_date: 2012-11-27 15:34:57
so you tested the ultraprune? or normal with better setting for hdd?
@_date: 2012-08-01 11:02:05
Definitely. I was also educated by this article a bit. The HYIP is a threat for bitcoin economy but more for those who are members. No matter when, but they will be fucked once.

Guys sell it. We are getting deep into the hole... 
@_date: 2012-11-22 20:23:03
Actually banks are what shoul be regulated, there are banks that maintain regulation nowadays. It is source of problem, banks feel very powerful. While they are only seeming so. Let´s make a bank run
Sory for OT maybe
@_date: 2012-08-14 09:41:33
Bitcoin is not legaly called currency. It is not legal tender, it is like paying with gold. They cannot ban you. At least in Europe, where I live.
@_date: 2012-07-27 17:08:47

@_date: 2012-12-06 07:06:09
LOL. great fantasy but i do not want to imagine ... :D
@_date: 2012-11-18 09:55:15

It is normal. The probability in action. I had the same concern about a week ago ;)
@_date: 2016-10-30 20:46:00
you mean the leverage - the more it is centralized the easier it could be attacked so that I can wipe my wealth?
@_date: 2016-10-29 20:28:27
I am doing the same. I left all those shitcoins (I am in bitcoin since middle of 2012), I see how bitcoin is the future (still) not some dash, litecoin or anything. decentralization is TOP priority. 
Very bullish times are here. Other crypto does not even have a 1/10 of bitcoin's decentralization. I did insane amount of  due diligence in last years :)

What about countermail, I am using this Sweden hosted mail service and I have good experience with them. I talked to them about bitcoin and they did not know that bitpay and other payment service providers exist. I hope they now know because I told them. 
It is overaly based on PGP encryption which can be very easily set even for people who do not use countermail. 
Look at:

This is not a company/asset/security/etc it is money and ledger and the whole new great system securing itself wherever and for as long as this will be the best one and even this is not so big threat as bitcoin can change itself in some aspects.

Therefore we expect bubble but we are not probably not in bubble. The bubble behaves quit differently. 
Of course that I am playing with words. But this is not typical bubble it rather is great growth with growing strenght of fundaments.
@_date: 2013-01-22 13:00:36
Personally. Bitcoin is going for its fair value. Our user base growed a lot and bitcoin has scarcity, divisibilite etc. We are going where we should have already been.

Through life we are getting freedom for something. Some of those freedoms (rights) are natural or we can say intrinsic to human kind. 
Firts right is for life, we are alive and we have body that only ourselves really decide about. 
Second is life for freedom of movement as we start being able to walk. 
And the third natural right  is about owning something. We have hands and we are able to touch things or move them. When we hunt something down then it belongs to us. 
This  three rights are elementary. It probably belongs to the philosophy of John Locke. 
Do not forget that this man is really important for our euroamerican history and justice. He helped a lot with American Constitution and so on. 
Legal does not mean legitimate. At least not directly. Our rights are always derived from three elemtary rights. And other rights are very often suppresing the natural rights of man. This can be taken as contribution to bitcoin philosophy. Even if we really do not have any. Like internet, but those things do work and therefore it always has some philosophy even when it is not defined.
