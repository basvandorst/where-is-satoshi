Bitcoin is actually realively involatile, compared to other altcoins. The larger the market cap becomes, the less volatile it will be. Therefore, in the future, if adoption continues, it can indeed be an effective store of value

Bitcoin is not an effective payment method. It's a store of value.

Yes, in a communist system, the means of production are controlled by the workers instead of capitalists. Money is viewed as exploitive and absentee ownership of personal property is not accepted. "Capitalist democracy" indeed is a sham, as all democracies are: destruction of property rights through mob rule.

bitcoin will become a better store of value as its market cap grows. it's actually one of the most stable cryptocurrencies, compared to altcoins. only 20-30 swings max.

are you really arguing that the majority reason that gold has its value is because of its use in industrial settings? Why has gold been a store of wealth for thousands of years before the industrial revolution? why was it used as currency in hundreds of nations? are you going to drop the "jewelry" meme next?

You didn't listen to what I said. I'm not going  to  repeat myself. Go search  up andreas antonopoulos reasoning for why Bitcoin has value.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:59:07
Are you really trying to argue that Bitcoin has no basis for value? The Reas n bitcoin is valuable is because of the intense computational power that is invested into the system, which produces an immutable, 100% trustworthy ledger. That is incredibly valuable in an age where computers can copy any information it can get it's hands on.  The work done to mine Bitcoin is akin to mining gold, and the reward is similar in both cases aswell, the acquisition of a token of verifiable value.

No, I only read your title, sorry.


because people like to make money, its pretty simple.


Because of noob money,like you mentioned, driven by mainstream exposure. Most people dont know about crypto. the ones that do only know bitcoin. Some know about ether. If you know anything past that you're in the vast minority.

Bitcoin is the prototype, the pioneer. Was the first computer the most efficient ever made? clearly not, however it laid the groundwork for the massive technological advancements that we now use everyday. 
Check out some other cryptocurrencies if you're interested in seeing some great tech that address the problems we are seeing with bitcoin.
The technology is the future, not this specific coin. Once you adjust your frame of reference or your scope of this field, it becomes clear that crypto is indeed the future of the internet.

Central banking is not a trait of capitalism, it's a trait of large central governments. It's ironic you think that, because crypto is literally the capitalist response to socialist central banking
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:16:30
they both benefit from the interbank interest rate set by the federal reserve, as well as fdic insurance, and 10% fractional reserve banking, and the assumption of bailouts if they make poor financial decisions, and heavy banking regulations which exclude competitors from competing for their market share, so yes, they are the government's fault.

I bought 1/10th of a bitcoin at $800 a little while back. It was all I could afford. I just graduated college, I wish I was born one year earlier so I could actually have had a sizable enough paycheck to properly invest. Makes me sad that I've missed the wave.

this is clearly a bubble, and even if it's not, its bad for a currency to have the massive periods of volatility. It's not a mark of a currency, it's a mark of a speculative investment. A good currency should be relatively stable. Have you ever seen the USD double or halve in value in like, a couple weeks?

because bitcoin is a shitty currency atm. These insane price spikes (and the inevitable corrections) make it FAR too volatile to be a useful currency. Bitcoin will have to stabilize before we see widespread adoption of it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:01:51
the people who are  saying that aren't some kind of oracle lol...
it's clearly a bubble and they know nothing. It might hit 5k, it might crash in 30 minutes. If you're going to ride the bubble, don't invest anything you can't afford to lose.

Why can't wallets do all of this calculation themselves? the user shouldn't have to check the mempool and do some mental math to see how many satoshi would be a good fee atm, the average user has no idea what a mempool is, what a satoshi is, what even mining fees are in a lot of cases. Wallets should have a dynamic scale that takes into account the size of the mempool, current average fees, transaction times, and performs the calculations needed for the user to be able to use a slider to control the **wait time** not the **fee size**
