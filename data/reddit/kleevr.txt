is it possible to (roughly) count how many kilowatts have so far been consumed by bitcoin creation?

Interesting.  Though I am sure my "methodology" is flawed.  I wanted to try and calculate a commodity value of the average bitcoin. With your numbers, I tried (76GWh/9M Coins)*(.10 cents/1kWh) = $.84 / coin.  (I realize this number isn't representative of perceived value, I was just curious.)
Hmmm, realizing now I'd need to account for investment of dedicated hardware somehow for this to be any where near accurate. I was just trying to get a handle on what does it cost to "make" a bitcoin.  Then I found this thread,  
Anyway, thanks for the reply.

I can't believe bitcoins are over 6 USD.

It's anonymous in the same way the Tor network is anonymous.

Every time I see BitCoins pass parity against the USD I get excited.

I think we're about to see a crash... will watch closely over the next 24 hours.  If it does crash, I'm getting in right then and there!

Tangent, but I can't wait till bitcoin has enough traction that I can google "1 BTC to USD".

As someone with virtually zero position currently, I don't mind the correction.  Sorry for any loses of course... :-/
Instead of buying in via USD, I decided to jump for a 5Gh/s BFL ASIC and get my BTC the hardway.  Here's hoping that that investment doesn't go to zero (scam), but definitely not building a GPU rig with ASICs entering the hashing pool.

Heh, I was way late to the game, payed with paypal and went ahead and got a refund within 7 days of ordering.  I was like preorder   Ain't nobody got time for that shit.

I saw it run into the massive sell wall at 250/USD at MtGox before bed last night, but I've heard of sales around 266.

I've got a video capture from bitcoinity from when bitcoin first passed 990 until it hit 1000 (up to 1030 actually).  It's encoding now, plan to try speeding it up once that's done.

Bitcoinity just now came back, FYI.

So how is this going to work in years to come when the block chain is much longer?  Are we just counting on Moore's law to save our ass?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:10:57
Yeah, I didn't do enough due diligence before pre-order.  I did use PayPal, so I should be somewhat able to reverse it, but haven't yet.  (I would feel like a fool if they did ship.)  So, I'm trying to decide if I'm a lunatic for not reversing it already.

Do you have any sellers near you on here: 
For smaller amounts of BTC this seems like the most convenient method.

Oh, I was assuming they were pegging to Mt Gox.  In a cash transaction I would hope pay something like 10% over spot, 100% over spot is absurd.
