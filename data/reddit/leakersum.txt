"be your own bank"

Why is posting personal addresses bad? I see nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:11:58
Can you post the link to your website please? I'd like to help with your "only 1%" :)

I agree. The same thing with BitID; you don't need the blockchain. A blockchain is great if a decentralized network has to agree on one thing (like the order of transactions), but not required to have a working network in the first place. A lot of programs are starting to introduce a blockchain, which is non-sense. Storj, BitID, EMP... why do we need a blockchain for a communication program? **IF** a public index is necessary then we use a distributed-hash-table (DHT).

makes me sick. I can understand when people don't like Bitcoin, but those fuckers from that subreddit spend time to read, write and collect information about Bitcoin - then they make fun of it. Why? Are they obsessed?
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:15:27
IIRC, the reason Ghash.io lowered their hashrate is because of the out-cry.
@_date: 2014-09-11 13:37:50
I think it was a mean joke.
@_date: 2014-09-01 17:09:49
That's because they had control over the private keys - the feds just sent those coins to their own wallet. If the guy behind SR didn't screw up, it wouldn't be possible to "seize".
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:43:08
PoW will still be an issue if banksters "get" that they can control it. But denying transactions or even manipulating the blockchain would be illegal.
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:24:37
Ignorant idiot!
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:24:42
Yeah, like PayPal isn't the top leader in "the camwhore market"...
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:40:05
I'll keep it simple.
Maidsafe; a network which lets you browse HTML pages (like the Tor network/darknet). It's a new kind of world wide web that uses a technology with the purpose to "kill the server" -&gt; decentralization.
Storj: decentralized data storage, redundant.
Bittorrent Sync: Unlike Storj, you need to run a server on your own.

And Localbitcoins!
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:33:04
Continue testing.

Why do you need a coinbase account?
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:10:01
Wow, that service looks awesome! Are you sure it's legit?
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:17:03
Bitcoin is great, but in the long run it really has to dump the proof-of-work system. Alternative? I don't know yet.
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:19:59
While true, Freenet does have some issues that keep me away from using it. Also, the development is really poor and outdated. And it's written in Java.

He has 27 upvotes + gold...

IIRC, about 10% holding.

Normally, when a user visits a website the browser downloads all the content needed. In Maidsafe, that downloaded data can be shared with other users/nodes. Meaning; the more popular the website, the faster it gets (like with a torrent). So when a new user wants to visit a website, the browser doesn't download from "the server", but from multiple sources instead. That's the goal from Maidsafe; every user/node is a part of the server. Storj has the same purpose, but only to store data - not for browsing.
There's a similar network called "Freenet". Since it's not that popular it's really slow. But it absolutely incredible if you use it for private networks. That's the great thing about it; you can create your own, closed internet with specifically chosen members/friends. Attackers can't even know if it exists.
So why use Maidsafe? I haven't looked too much into it, but since I have a little history with Freenet here are some things that are worth using it:
1. Censorship resistant.
2. No server down times
3. Everything is encrypted; ISPs/Governments *can't* see what packages you request -&gt; anonymity.
4. Popular websites like imgur could be extremly fast.
5. With Maidsafe it might be possible to create private groups.

Well, there will be [Bitcoin Suisse AG](  pretty soon.
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:15:30
Coinbase is the new PayPal.
@_date: 2014-07-14 01:18:07
And no 'bit', too!!
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:48:07
Discus Fish is getting bigger and bigger. Since they're from China (I heard) they probably won't react to a Reddit out-cry. That keeps me worrying...
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:04:48
As mentioned on their website, the trading platform will open at the end of july. I hope an instant BTC to CHF conversion (for businesses) will be included.
@_date: 2014-09-13 00:03:30
Ever heard of "internet search engine"?
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:38:17
The idea of creating a decentralized system that uses PoW to sort the order of transactions was great, but as we can see it didn't turn out the way we wanted. The mining "industry" is awfully centralized, and the miners/operators don't seem to care. Is PoS a solution? No. Few people own huge amounts of the percentage - same with PoW.

I really wish I wouldn't have bought PETA shares...
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:31:58
Thanks for the response! I will definitely keep an eye on it!
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:30:57
Read the article's comment section. Not disappointed.
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:14:19
Why so? Isn't it the root of your philosophy?
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:25:25
I don't know how it will be.
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:06:28
Okay, you convinced me. I remember when BTC Guild was the biggest one. But what I heard about Discus Fish is that it's a private mining pool, meaning; miners can't just leave. Aren't you concerned?
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:31:29
Docs or didn't happen.
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:57:22
Wow, looks great! Really like the "Shades of Night" set. Do you also have some loli-like furries?

Honestly, I don't know. Probably not. Most enterprises (in my experience) just use VPN technology to connect to a central/internal network.
