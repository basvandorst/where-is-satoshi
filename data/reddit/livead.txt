I... love... this, period.
A "bat signal" of sorts.
The call is made but deniable and unknown if the message was received.

I might be a lone wolf here with this opinion however... Bureaucratic disease... laws and regulations are tantamount to the crippling of both cryptocurrency/public ledger/blockchain and individual freedom/liberty/privacy/security/choice along with gutting the deepest intentions and potentials of its use... here is a video representing much of my feelings about this "think tank":

How about for ANY address that has ANY amount of bitcoin?
Is there any way to communicate a message that the owner of an address with bitcoin in it would be able to access and see?

So is there no website that allows for the posting of a message to a bitcoin address?

Although  will not "fix" content owned/controlled by "the big boys"... it absolutely can revolutionize new media... the small artists/creators.
It comes down to giving up a certain control set that businesses are not used to giving up... however with the "right" tracking/technologies along with the best "values" and incentives... both the consumers AND creators will benefit on bigger scales and in many more ways. 
I'll try to followup with more details when I'm on a keyboard instead of mobile.

You'd pay $1 for $1 because they print it. 
BitCoin is FINITE and with "spillage" will, in the end, have a total of well under the 21million mined.
It only gets more scarce... not the opposite... DEFLATIONARY not INFLATIONARY.

$5k by end of the year... tens of millions of reason$ why.

Kook. Why wouldn't you just call your jpmorgan sphincter and have him buy some stock using the money from your citibank account you borrowed from your bofa account?
F'n coinbase...
F coinbase.
I'd rather buy taxes or just gift it to the irs.
Coinbase and bitcoin shouldn't be used in the same sentence.

 - Not so much for hollywood as it is for the majority of content creators and consumers... 
Safely download/use/share any digidupe content knowing it's legal and that if/when you want to pay... you can along with getting your own "DigiDuped" copy to possibly make money for yourself and the creators/owners.

Because the foundation is systematically being controlled by United States interests (government and corporations)... see latest MIT bitcoin events.
