I don't think I had problems understanding that 1 kilometer contains 1000 meters, and 1 meter contains 1000 millimeters as a kindergarten child. It's easy enough if you grow up using the metric system.
And nicknames for sub-units of Bitcoin are a good idea, but I don't think "bit" is the right choice, especially because that unit already exists and it means something different.

Primecoin is interesting for a whole number of reasons. It's completely resistant to ASICs/FPGAs, it has a smooth difficulty algo (adjusted after every block), it will keep being mined at a low rate forever to prevent deflation (a currency with 1% inflation is more interesting for payments than a quasi-commodity that will keep rising in value).
It doesn't receive the attention it deserves imho.

[The cycle took less than a year each time.]( (e.g. April 2013 - November 2013)
The question was asked in February 2014, shortly after the last boom. So it really wasn't unreasonable to assume that by February 2015, the next rally would've already happened.

I guess you committed heresy by pointing that out, and people are downvoting you without actually having any refutation to offer.
It is a known problem that Bitcoin development and mining is fairly centralised, and [others are trying to fix that.](
