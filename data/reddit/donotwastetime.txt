can you share your math ?
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:37:57
yet the price for the customer for say a years worth of gold paid with any CC I imagine is the same ?
We need more transparency in the market and realize there is a difference between a payment and a purchase and that the two of course are related but are not one thing.
The customer on one end sees the purchase part. He spends X. The business receives a payment which is usually less than X and depends on multiple factors (as you say).
I've learned today from a business meeting that big business make deals with many payment processors and route payments depending on the "originator" processor of the customer.
These big businesses make deals with all major payment processors (don't think of Visa, think the N processors that accept Visa, in some countries the processors are pretty much only banks) such that they can pay lower fees.
Small shops instead send the payment via their processor which charges them extra to as it has multiple processor involved and thus multiple fees.
This is very similar to how the mobile phone world works.
I get a simcard with say Vodafone or T-Mobile and they offer me cheaper calls and cheaper sms (maybe even free) with either all or some numbers from within the same mobile network.
It's even worst because it's not only who you call matters but where you are matters too because if the phone goes on roaming on someone else's operator you may end up paying extra for that too.
The real evil with credit cards is that it affects everyone, even people dealing with cash, because of the transactions fees and fraud possibilities the price is jacked up for everyone.
Some give discounts sometimes but some places don't even take cash anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:52:16
unlikely. 
not only you'd be charged the cc fee, but on top of that the risk of fraud with CC for BTC, which is the highest.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:47:03
sure but be careful about the man in the middle attack, check peoples rating and how long they have been around.
Someone orders bitcoin from you, the get your bank details, they sell a non-existing product (like an iPhone) to a third party and relay your bank details.
The fucker now has your btc and the third party will now go after YOU.
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:09:29
I like you!
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:26:42
You could double spend it with a fee and once that has enough confirmations you are good
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:49:17
I guess once there's enough people accepting bitcoin more and more people will realize is actually better to keep btc long term.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:41:19
He meant coins that are the disruptive technology, not just mere copycats that can't possibly fight the network effect.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:32:14
The number of shops accepting it is growing everyday
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:07:25
you could use a green address.
not that hard.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:59:37
In my mind nothing changed.
I mean, we already had a drop which was quite similar to this one, there's up and downs and waves in the middle.
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:38:52
also, old people don't know what bittorrent is.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:59:22
Nobody in their right mind should use this software until open sourced and checked out.
It would be like giving a stranger access to your business / bank account for an incredible promise of 15% improved efficiency.
Even if it is not a scam, it smells like one from miles. 
People stay away unless you know what you're doing and can test this software thing an isolated environment, string it and debug it.
I'm looking at strings now.

There are parts of intel chips which are not well defined or so i read on the article.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:55:47
well it's just a matter of learning mathematics and cryptography if you want to have any real knowledge about how corrupt it can go.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:25:45
Cool, just sent them this:
I bought a few things from you and I was wondering when you'll be accepting bitcoins.
I think it provides a competitive advantage as it avoids the credit card fees as well as fraud allowing between 5 and 10% bigger margins for you or better price for the consumer.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:18:02
and why sell when it seems it will go higher .. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:09:42
that's centralized, i don't see why anyone would give it any hope or anything.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:11:51
sure, but i can as well just write down my cold wallet instead of buying hard coins for some premium
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:04:41
very very few are buying them.
@_date: 2013-05-24 22:42:39
although this could be fixed with a generated card for each purchase very easily.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:10:41
We should set up a fund to write a bot to limit/reduce the manipulation. If the manipulation continues anyway for long then we know it was mtgox :)

Good use for my cows.
@_date: 2013-03-31 12:37:10
Was the exchange fair ? 
Very cool story. The best money ever ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:44:50
Sure good idea generally but the delta between what you paid and what is sells for now may still be less than what you'd make by buying now.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:40:45
Btw if you want to work together on some open source project let me know

@_date: 2013-04-06 08:44:12
I guess if you buy bitcoins every month like lots of people do with their dollar cost average then it doesn't really make a difference if you buy in btc or dollars in terms of what you can save by doing this, assuming same price, but it surely does make sense to use btc to improve the economy.
As far as I'm concerned if I can pay something in btc, even if it costs me up to 1% more, i'm happy to go the btc way as it helps the economy. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:35:52
LSD. wait, what ?
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:34:29
Sure, I just meant don't tell friends and extended family, just the ones you must tell in case something happens to you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:31:03
if you are in for the long term you don't care.
People are being told to put in btc no more than they can afford to lose, which means that they can wait until it goes up again, as it will.
The same thing happened when it went to $30+ and then down to $2.
The best time to buy in my humble opinion.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:08:39
don't call people crazy.
it's at the very least plausible, after all there are quite a few powerful people which would have interests in bitcoin not getting traction.
@_date: 2013-07-19 12:01:10
I sent an email a few months ago, they said they were not interested for the time being.

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:55:07

As I said, it is a very dark business.
Major banks finance relatively small companies that take all the pricing information from all or most of the players, run some spreadsheet on it, and have two results, one for the big banks and one for everyone else.
It happened with libor, it happened with CDS, it happens with everything.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:32:46
is it worth it though?
Most computers don't come with any decent mining hardware, wouldn't it be more efficient to use them for spamming and for DDOSing ?

Don't know but that's what it was more or less (2btc +/-)

Come on, you snakemcgraw ?
We said that when it was $50. Then $100. Then $150. Then $200. Then $250.
Won't take long before $500 happens.
Or it goes to zero.
@_date: 2013-07-17 08:58:09

We will see $200, I just think that if it happens too fast we'll have what you just described, if it happens over time then it will just stick.
I can't wait for the change on mtgox so that you can't set orders for amounts you don't have in the system, speeding up and reducing lag.

I don't necessarily believe it either, I'm not the main one talking about it, the kernel developers of the module that uses the intel in chip memory entropy have been discussing recently, and it is entirely possible, you should be able to find it with google or here on reddit if I find it I'll post it.

Thanks for answering me.
I too think that the m5s took some idea away from the pirate movement (as well as other movements).
It seems that the pirate party in italy is just a joke, in fact, i wouldn't be surprised if it is just controlled opposition (in italy, not that i know of in sweden or germany).
Completely agree on the fact that the referendum should have been held before but we have to start somewhere. It's incredible how both the left wing and right wing associated mass media are fighting the m5s, it speaks loud of their interests.
What you can do better ? Do more of what you are doing.
Raise awareness, spread the truth, change the law.
I think bitcoin may be able to push this further, so let's tip people and get everyone on board!

@_date: 2013-04-01 22:45:02
Until this becomes open source, stay away from it.
Even then, wait for a few bitcoin industry people to review the source code.
The fact that there has been no post on bitcointalk of this miner, the heart of bitcoin development, it's not a great sign at all.
Seriously this could take your wallet or could just send the money to his own wallet for all we know.
In case this is genuine and the source ends up with OSS licence and being checked on and results clean from malware: good job. thanks for the effort!
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:34:39
I'd imagine more than half of those are to put money in as opposed to out.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:54:27
And it can always go down, so not spending it is a risk.
And if you really need or want something, just like with computers you'll buy it knowing that in 6 months you could buy more with the same money.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:18:27
you have a point there. A scary point. Shit.
EDIT: Apparently it didn't 
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:56:13

What becomes key then is what truths are you interested in and what issues you want to understand and or even perhaps solve.
People investigate all sorts of things, the features and reviews/defects of their new car before they buy it (some at least do), or whether some football or basked game was fair with camera replays from different angles and what not.
The same goes for gossip, who kissed whom.
Everyone one of us has some interests and we can't possibly be interested in everything but I feel that at this time in history most people are not interested enough in the things that really matter and are far too interested in things that after all are only mundane and are very far from affecting us (as a whole in particular).

it's a good discussion topic although some people won't research or trust it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:50:32

@_date: 2013-04-09 06:12:45
As if they give a shit whether they are wrong or right. They just want a message to go out, to frame some news within a context [see hackers, drugs, crash, bubble] and only allow the discussion within that frame.

@_date: 2013-04-16 06:17:58
Right now bitstamp is $1 more than mtgox
I think people do take advantage of it, but it is not that easy to do it as safely as possible.
Ideally you'd have funds and bitcoin in 2 or more exchanges and have a bot do the arbitrage for you, i think there are a few open source bots out there that just do this.
I think the issue is that these bots don't do well with lag (now 3 seconds, often more than this)
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:50:11
I also think it has to go way higher before it bubbles off, at the moment bitcoin is underpriced

There is not ETA.
What if they take months and are actually just evaluating ? what if they are waiting for more support behind it, and if this doesn't come they'll just cancel it ?
What if litecoin is holding up because of that chance ? how long will it hold up ?
Won't it disappear behind the shadow of btc ? LTC are in my view are much more risky than BTC.

Bitstamp is ok.
I find it better than mtgox but I'm also the kind of guy that buys just a few BTC here and there, I don't need hundreds of coins of volumes and long term the spread doesn't affect me much.
The only issue I find with bitstamp is that sometimes, twice so far when I wanted to trade, it was down (this in few months worth of usage, at least weekly), although these times it was also when mtgox was under heavy load and lag if not down.
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:29:22
well you avoid all the maintenance and upgrades at the expenses of earning possibly quite a bit less and having to trust someone.
With the shares in theory it is easier to sell them than the hardware too should you want to get out, but just as with asics, by the time you want to sell it there might be noone around to buy it (at least for a reasonable price)

hopefully not too late but i think they'll deliver, not too far from what they said recently.

Still going for 115$ each in UK on localbitcoins.com for uk bank transfers.
The bid is very low though,  around $61 dollars and on the gox is traveling around 80$ each.
Either we're still waiting for a correction or looks like bitcoin is just 100% up from few weeks back which is not bad.
However if bitcoin doesn't go anywhere then I think the price will go back up faster than last time.

Yes, although it becomes more and more difficult for any single person to audit the full stack, in fact, I fear we are already beyond that point.
Imagine someone having to audit the cpu design, the memory controller design if not builtin as well as other components on the board, the assembler, the compiler and all the library toolkits.
I don't think it is going to get easier, is going to get harder.

forget about mining. Most people don't need to mine and if one country doesn't mine it makes no difference.
I can still do it on paper and get someone outside the country to propagate the transaction, i don't need to generate much.
This is getting into territory though.

You can assume bitcoin is a non-issue so far and I think you'd have good chances of being right.
What I am trying to say is that if bitcoin becomes any bigger (think as big as paypal or so)  then I would argue that the most powerful super power will most likely put measures in place to kill bitcoin unless it benefits it.

Well you are right, bitcoin is like nothing we ever seen.
The best innovation in money since gold was used.
I believe bitcoin will naturally win over a lot of people, at least until the fundamentals of bitcoin are still valid and working.
What I am slightly conscious about is that big interests can probably manipulate it either directly at the market level of at the legislative level, although if they handle it like they handled the internet we should be 'OK'.

WIth blockchain you have your keys and you can access your wallet from your own client.
So you are wrong, they couldn't do it with an online wallet like blockchain.
They could do it in a wallet maybe like instawallet, but even those are disappearing.
In an exchange in theory they could do it, but then again if they ever got caught nobody will ever continue using them.

Just because they failed with clipper doesn't mean they didn't succeed.
Besides the classical  which is more relevant than ever I think that between arm, intel and amd they all have the capability of embedding backdoors in their CPUs, whether they were forced by their respective secret governments I couldn't possibly know but it seems that some companies have been forced to provide data and it doesn't take much of a difference.
Then at the OS level and then at the software level.

No unless you created a new address just to receive 1 btc.
However, if you have 10 btc in one wallet and spend 9.5, 0.5 will be sent back to you, generally to  new address, and if this is not included in the backup you may risk losing the 0.5.
I think a new wallet has about a 100 wallets before it needs a new backup but mind you, this is implementation dependent.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:54:06
I also don't want any control of which addresses and which coins can and cannot be used. 
*It's a slippery slope.*
@_date: 2013-04-18 09:24:09
I didn't sell. 
I got coins at various levels (from 140 down for each semi-stable price point).
Did I lose any money ? Only time will tell.
Did I lose some potential conversion USD ?
Maybe, or sure, but you never know when the bubble it's going to burst and (if it's a bubble at all) and to which amount it's going to correct and if you're in for the long term, you risk more by playing day trade than not.
Unless you're really good at day trading and somewhat predicting the future.
On the other hand, I wished I had more cash in the account to do some day trading so since the crash I've put new money and I do sometimes day trade but we're talking small trades for small gains (or small losses).

i like the idea, it's like a localbitcoins, only online, with all the currencies.
You know what I don't like [yet] ? the source is not available and it doesn't sell itself very well.
i see it as a p2p transferwise/azimo with less fees and somewhat p2p, but, maybe I just didn't get it.

@_date: 2013-04-07 17:14:51
cashing them in - localbitcoins.com, mtgox.com bitstamp.com
Buying them from the uk visit the uk bitcoin subreddit but it pretty much involves sending money to mtgox or bitstamp either from your bank (via a sepa for bitstamp or a wire for mtgox) or you can do an intermediate step to save on fees and conversion by using transferwise.com or azimo

Very interesting Federico.
Yes I agree, the M5S is (so far) a very good movement for Italy and one of the few that has credibility.
For the casual reader, believe it or not, Italy still have Berlusconi in power through a mega-coalition of left and right [which until a year ago acted as if they hated each other] and it appears that such is so that they can get the M5S squeezed/neutralised
I didn't see the word bitcoin on the page following the link, how do you know that was the question?

Sorry but I disagree.
Just because the BBC has been hated in the past doesn't mean it is fair and unbiased/neutral.
You think the clip was JUST ignorance ? They decided to frame bitcoin in this way, without doing any research and are spreading FUD.
Exactly like they have done with Iran, Syria, Ecuador just to name a few.
They are neutral when it doesn't matter to them, until it affects the establishment at which point they become the establishment propaganda.

I can't predict but: people are not selling all at this price. They just won't, and more and more people are looking to get hold of bitcoins because of the advantages it has which will make the price go up on the long term.
This as long as the rate of services accepting bitcoin and people using bitcoin keeps rising at some pace.
In the short term I think it will go a bit up, a bit up, a bit down, back up, etc ..

I disagree.
Bitcoin has some value at $1, but at $50k it has more value because if it changes between $50000 and $50005 it makes very little difference for your $5 purchase, it does however make a huge difference if from $1 it went even just $1.20
TL;DR Bitcoin at $50k means the exchange rate matters less and less for everyday purchases, while at $1 range they have a huge impact.

Martingale can be used with any, not just the 50/50.
You risk a lot for a very small gain and you will reach the end of your coins sooner that you'll say "this is enough wins, i can stop now" if you ever get there to say it at all.
Furthermore, there are limits set within satoshidice which means that even if you did have enough bitcoins you wouldn't be able to double up at some point.
Last but not least, before playing with satoshi dice, try one of the simulators to understand how likely you are to win or lose.
*ProTip*: You're going to lose little by little more and more, take it as entertainment and only bet what you can afford to lose if this is your thing.

As long as I can buy things online and exchange them locally for cash it is not very dissimilar to having an account in one currency (euro for instance) and living in a country with a different currency (say UK).

He is saying that if we can reuse the hardware then the infrastructure would be easily available, including asics and fpgas, but this would also mean that some miner group could easily become the 51% of the new currency before enough people jump in.
On the other hand he is saying that if reusing the hardware it's not possible, than the new currency doesn't have much infrastructure as all previous infrastructure is wasted.
Which makes sense, and means that because of this and the network affect, unless of major unfixable bugs in the bitcoin protocol, bitcoin is going to be king.

Protip: You could say exactly the same about someone reporting on bitcoin invested in fiat (everyone else).
Another protip: The media is influenced by policy which is influenced by big money and big interests, they never knowingly talk good about bitcoin and when they do they make sure to reframe it and avoid at all cost any discussion outside of the frame.
Usually for bitcoin it's childporn, drugs, tax evasion, gambling, whatever they can throw at it.

@_date: 2013-04-17 07:06:09
Weird you say that, I did a buy order for a slightly higher price than the lower ask because it was for a small amount and I needed a bit more, so basically I set it to the price of the second best/lowest ask.
When I go look at transactions it looks like both transactions where at the highest price.

There is no such thing.
There is no normal value. 
It's all up to demand and offer. 
Thing is these two can be manipulated either way and nobody knows exactly where those two values really are and if some strong and popular actors (knowingly or unknowingly) think the price is something this will actually redefine demand and offer.
My view is that with the growth of services and people around bitcoin the price now is relatively low.

There is no reason as to why you couldn't encode a bitcoin transaction in an SMS (or list thereof) and have the phone on the other side detect them just like they do today with multipart messages.

I guess the reason Jeff is worried is that if Iran starts using it then it kind of gives the US reasons to fight it.
I can see that line of reasoning although I have a feeling the US does desire a global currency and I feel that with Nvidia, AMD, Intel and european ARM friends they can easily control the mining process one day without anyone ever noticing (they just need to split/distribute the mining on  pools)

An App can be deleted by facebook even if it is not currently against their TOS, since they could quickly change it as they have done in the past.
I too agree that people on facebook don't want to share necessarily how much they have and how much they are spending but it could be good to get people started with small amounts.
I'm not sure .. I just can't think of a way to send money to facebook users reliably even if facebook decides to not allow access to the platform by the app later in the future while perhaps you still have not moved your balance to a wallet of which you know the private key.
Basically you need to trust a third party like .. strongcoin, and some people know that they can get either hacked (like they just did) or run away with all the coins.

Given the queue at mtgox I would then to agree with you.
Lots of people I know AFK started asking about these bitcoins and how do they get some.
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:30:39
You are doing it right!
Upvote and wish you some luck!
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:54:02
I'm using bitstamp.
I guess it depends on volume.
Mtgox is preferably avoided yes, mostly because of centralization and because of the chaos created by the extreme lag.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:41:37
i hope this theory holds

a much better bet than tulip.
When tulip crashed, it never moved back, bitcoin has.
Furthermore bitcoin has all the good property about gold and all the good property as a bank and paypal, all in one, it's just different, like the internet.
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:04:38
there are a few on the wiki, even some with schematics with arduino or mbed boards.
it has to be cheap and secure, less than $50 I'd say to begin with.
Once it is mass produced and with some competition we'll see cheap ones, &lt; $10
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:06:45
well bitstamp is ok for lowish volumes, for big volume you're better off looking else where or you'd have to be ok with huge slippage.
mtgox is better at that but i hope more people will move off it.
What about tradehill ? any review ?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:16:18
Bitcoin is either 0 or the sky.
I don't think it will be able to get stable for long at any price.
However, once it reaches say $1000 and you are buying something in btc worth say $10, it will make very little difference whether the exchange rate is $1000 or $1005.
@_date: 2013-07-08 08:21:08
Buy some yes, no more than you can afford to lose and secure them as good as you can.
Other ways to make money ? 
Accept bitcoin for services and goods, if you find the right sweetspot you can expect lots of business from bitcoiners.
Basically the same you'd do with any currency, trade it, buy btc denominated securities, lend it, etc

it sure can be mined with gpu today.
And asics are possible too, just not the one designed for bitcoin.
The worst part is that if even a small bitcoin pool decides to mine litecoin they can take over 51% and fork it the way they want and double spend as much as they want.
It seriously has NO advantage to bitcoin and no network effect either as strong as btc.

Only issue with that is that bitcoin has nothing to do with them.
Bitcoin is a technology that can not only survive crashes as it did but can also mean improved market efficiency in terms of ecommerce margin and one step closer to a more democratic money mean.

Don't store them on your PC(unless encrypted and on a system isolated from possible keyloggers, say a live cd) and don't store them on mtgox.
Store them on a paper wallet or a brain wallet but be sure to research and try before you do anything with all the money.

It's very bullish and little transparent to the enduser.

No where in the article it says they were infiltrated, just a "stronger than usual" attack in terms of DDoS.

I already live much below my means and try my best to improve things around me (education, services, etc) and if you think well about it, we have more than we need and we could find a way to, within 50 years or less,  have machines to do everything that needs doing, allow everyone a safe and free mean, and improve society not for a mere personal ROI but for everyone's benefit.

it really depends on how much risk they want to take and whether their supplier will start taking bitcoins .. and even with those fees should they decide to avoid risk it still cost them much less, like 5-9% less.
Why should the value go down ?
@_date: 2013-04-30 07:39:54
litecoin is less secure than bitcoin because it has a low hash rate which could be taken over by any of the major gpu pools of bitcoin.
The faster block means you need to wait for more blocks too.
Get a few litecoin if you wish although i consider it orders of magnitudes less likely to succeed than bitcoin because of the network effect.

@_date: 2013-04-08 07:23:07
that's it - you don't need to sell it on how much you've made but more on how it works (with details depending on audience), what it offers and more importantly all the current weakness (I say it is volatile as well as a risk) but that obviously so far it has been going quite well overall, it demonstrated to recover from panic and media bias.

@_date: 2013-04-05 17:59:44
why ?
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:55:44
Good point.
But depending on which exchange you're on, say bitstamp in particular, you'd have a hell of a lot of a difference with a small amount and thousand dollars amounts.
This is because of slippage, for small amounts worth the ask would probably always get filled at top ask while for bigger amounts it would "slip" into more and more in the ask and in practice cut your margin in a way that just wouldn't happen for small amounts.
Does it make sense ?
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:12:34

@_date: 2013-03-29 13:15:19

It may not be worth it (if you get caught) just like it wouldn't be worth getting killed for being attacked by a thief with a knife or a gun for your wallet.
You should better give them your wallet.
But if you can kick the motherfucker in the face and avoid it, you should probably do it.

Lots of slippage, no volume and very high volatility makes this hard.
Sure, you can do it relatively easy with 5 coins but there's still lots of risks and it's almost not worth it.
Usually when the market is more bullish bitstamp is 1/2 more, so the opposite.
Some people say it's because bitstamp doesn't require verification and people take a cut to avoid it although I had to verify so not sure to what extend it can be true.

technically they didn't ship a product, they released a prototype of the product which everyone else will get.
and they didn't "ship", the guy took it from the lab as they were testing it.
Anyway, I'm glad they are getting closer
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:00:34
it's not exactly like that. Some people over there do get it, but surely like in r/worldnews there has to be people trolling or astrosurfing- bitcoin in my mind is better than gold and cash fused together with email.
banks don't want it. Paypal don't want it. visa and mastercard don't want it and presumably anyone in power with some brain doesn't want it.
there are strong interests against it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:46:52
Which is worst, losing money from advertising (was there any at first anyway) or from a laggy trading platform ?
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:10:33
sure but no online shop takes USD, they take paypal o credit cards, which not only take some percentage of the transaction (3%?) but also are happy to unroll the transaction in case the transaction is fraudulent which means shops need to take that into account and more importantly into the final price.
You can already find some deals 5-10% cheaper in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:37:38

The London or NY exchange were not born perfect either.
I remember massive crashes for about a day, perhaps while they were on the Microsoft platform.
I agree on the programmers, the best ones use all the tools available to make sure the code is as bug free as it can be (unfortunately 0 is just not possible, risk is not black and white)

as far as I know your wallet just contains your private key, which doesn't really need to synchronize itself, you need to sync your bitcoin wallet client.

Some guy said this called Micheal commented this: 
The real thing that kills Bitcoin is not mentioned: The successor of Bitcoin. If they are smart THEY invent that successor. Of course with a backdoor.
My answer to that could be: yes, and I would then release it anonymously and push it to my best abilities.
Oh wait!

I agree, the population of Cyprus interested in btc is only a small %, however, the population in europe or even world wide that heard of what's happening there and is interested in btc is surely much larger, yet I agree, I'm not sure that's the only reason, just one of them.
More and more shops are accepting btc everyday.

I usually like Glenn.
What is this Sam Harris saying, that Islam is fundamentally not good ?
I don't know what Glenn said (I guess from the article that he attacked him for this) but I will go as far as to say that all religions are fundamentally wrong as you are asked to take something told to you as fact and have faith without any proof whatsoever.
Religion is complementary to mass media powers that big interests use to have their way.

it's up to you.
In the trading site you risk a hack and losing them all but you can also sell them faster.
if you are a sloppy computer user you may actually be safer with the online wallet than bitcoinqt.
If you do regularly backup, and encrypt your wallet then this is quite safe.
Even safer is to use a live system to do the transactions such that you don't risk keylogging.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:50:23
why holding usd if you are not trying to profit ? Well you got to store somewhere what you saved.
I don't get your question. I buy things with btc
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:03:49
Boo, can't comment on the article, perhaps this is just a FUD campaign.
Seems like the guy has no idea about what the network effect is.
In order to create a bitcoin competitor it is not enough to change the amount in circulation and perhaps the block time to be successful.
Otherwise paypal would have not survived long. But it did.
Ebay would have not survived long. But it did.
Now, with bitcoins, eventually paypal will die (unless bitcoins die before)
And when and if a better currency comes, those that will recognize it early will win, just like with btc.

they are not serious, or better, they are seriously pro establishment no matter what.
Just like the BBC, they try to be neutral when they can, but when it's time to critic or say anything that could disrupt the current establishment, you'll see that they are more then biased, they frame topics such that what is put under light is either FUD or anyhow irrelevant and they never come out of those frames. 
Any conversation outside of the frame is brought back into the frame.
In this sense, RT is one of the few that seems to be supportive of bitcoin.

To be honest asics from a mining prospective is the only thing that counts at the moment and within asics what counts is power consumption and Ghashes.
This is mostly dictated by design and manufacturing processes and the size of the chip.
The smaller it is the cheaper it is to make in big quantities and the less energy it needs. And better performance.

You got lucky and you sold high ?
You basically contributed to the panic.
I'm not saying it's your fault, and perhaps bitcoin does need day traders and or people that create liquidity locally although yesterday besides profiting from the crisis and increasing it is not something I'd be proud of.
