For the last time, transactions *are not free*.  At the current exchange rate, transactions cost $0.20, which is on the order of credit card transactions.

But how do you install electrum without connecting to the internet?
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:39:33
So when OP says 'offline' wallet, the computer is still connected to the internet?!

How is this not the top link?!
It seemed like he was reading cue cards while talking about tax reform.  Interesting that BTC and taxes are brought up in the same interview.
Did Iceland *really* ban bitcoin exchanges?  I saw that link here but I am not sure about everything that comes out of this subreddit.  Are they just scared of going bankrupt again?

The source tarball?  How do you get all of the dependencies needed? python-qt4, libqt, etc?
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:17:02
I have played around with that, but the one I downloaded didn't have python, which meant installing python from source, which I was trying to avoid.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:04:34
Haha not to me, to your real-life friends.

Ah. Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:09:28
Awesome! More tips in your future!

Haha I see, Mt. Gox does not allow deposits back into bank accounts?
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:04:23
Yes also so far no problems with coinbase.

Considering that the NSA *developed* SHA-2, it is probably safe to assume that they can subvert it.

I am actively researching how to create a linux distro with electrum under 100 MB.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:55:05
Sorry, could you explain?  Is there a section of the bot help I should read?
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:00:15
Too late. Amazon wins again. :S
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:29:51
Even if someone knew the password to OP's computer, how would they access it and the private keys stored on it?
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:30:52
@_date: 2013-09-05 22:55:08
Really though? Isn't it possible that they could release and endorse strong encryption schemes that they have already cracked?
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:02:49
You may want to stop advertising that you control thousands of BTC.
@_date: 2013-08-30 18:13:37
Also holy shit I can't believe I just gave CoinBase my online bank password.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:21:43
How much do you trust ECDSA given that:
1) The creator of the Bitcoin protocol is unknown
2) Point 5 from Shneier's article on [beating the NSA](


3) The feds managed to seize DPR's coins.

I am going to fire Charles Schwab.  Their online banking allows a MAXIMUM of 8 characters in your password...
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:54:53
Has anyone put this into a process for creating cold storage, especially in light of this article?
@_date: 2013-11-01 01:48:27
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:27:51
Interesting read on the the bitcointalk forum.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:15:22
I always check you guys first!
I also ended up with chain lube, a frame-mounted pump (which you may already carry?), and some reflective stickers to put on my backpack.
@_date: 2013-08-30 18:58:05
I immediately changed it afterwards.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:52:45
None taken! Haha much better.
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:35:01




These two point leads me to believe he misunderstands some fundamental concepts of Bitcoin.


Ask the average person how fractional reserve banking works and you will get similarly stupefied faces.
Not sure what this guy's interest is but I don't feel like this article has much substance.  *Why* does he think the US will fight Bitcoin tooth and nail.
