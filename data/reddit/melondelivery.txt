How much did you invest?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:40:40
How likely is it that all the people investing now are going to lose there money and would it be stupid of me to consider putting half my savings into Bitcoin? My investment would be 7 grand am I being a dumbass? I just dont want to miss the boat and if I don't invest this money it's just sitting in a saving account doing nothing. My dream is to build up enough money to become a property investor.
