@_date: 2017-01-21 13:45:28
you should probably contact whoever confirmed your transaction, maybe they’ll give you some of it back? who knows

You could buy an amazon gift card with bitcoin from egifter.com or gyft.com and use it there.

OP you could either use VIABTC and it will 100% get confirmed in a few hours, or you can PM me and I could refer you to someone who would get your transaction confirmed in less than 2 hours(he will take $8 from you)

I was talking about their free transaction accelerator 
You just enter your transaction ID there and submit, however the submissions are beyond limit right now so you can't use it.

Yeah I'm having the same issue, wait until they fix it.
