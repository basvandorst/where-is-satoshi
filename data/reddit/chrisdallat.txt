plenty of material out there refuting that statement. and he is in fact... not the the 'real deal'

you would think that, but the real world doesnt quite work like that... Herbalife is still chugging away, despite it being very clear to most people that its an MLM scheme...

I harbour a great deal of cynicism and nagativity? purely because of my opinion of Tony Robbins? Nice generalisation.... im sure your sensei Tony wouldnt approve of that judgement

''I find it curious that you’re so quick to label him a “snake oil  salesman” when it’s clear that you haven’t been to one of his seminars  or read anything he’s written. (If I’m mistaken, I apologize.)'' 
So how exactly is it clear that I havent read anything he has written or watched any of his siminars on video? I mean how else would I be able to form a judgement on him? I have seen plenty of his material and read plenty of it... but it is just typical Lifecoach stuff that anyone with any sense can work out for themselves... if they cant they are normally very lost people, and thats why they are easy targets for his extortionately priced seminars, in my opinion he is just exploiting vulnerable people

''So if its so bad, how he keeps finding new suckers? Normally such things only work if someone recommend it to another.'' 
What kind of an excuse is that? theres no shortage of suckers in the world and there never will be... and when some insecure lost person recommends something to someone in the same situation its pretty easy to keep fueling the fire.

yet youre called cryptobull? oh the irony of this market
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:15:09
i doubt it, if it hit 100k by end of year i would be stoked
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:48:02
lol... yeah hes gonna admit to you exactly how his scam works obviously
@_date: 2018-12-31 10:01:06
Ha, I have plenty positivity in my life without needing to pay some guy thousands of dollars for a seat to listen to him tell me pretty obvious stuff on how to be positive... but thanks for your concern
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:54:46
seems how it goes around here tbh
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:19:35
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:51:14
yeah makes sense... so 21million dollars with which everyone has to battle over to use when they want to buy something... logical as anything i ever heard... why didnt we all see this sooner?
@_date: 2018-12-31 10:02:25
not more important to him THAN money though... if he really just wanted to help people he would charge more reasonable prices than thousanddds of dollars for a seat
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:18:43
its not exactly paying for something they 'like', theyre paying for something that they think will somehow miraculously change their lives, and pay a ridiculous amount for the same self affirmation spiel that every 'lifecoach' out there posts on youtube for free.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:13:27
thats way too much, im heavily invested but 80% is a stretch, you leave yourself with no fallback if you lose your job or if it goes tits up
@_date: 2018-12-30 22:24:03
that Snake Oil Salesman... biggest scammer out there... but hey, he done well getting rich off telling insecure people shit that anyone could tell them
