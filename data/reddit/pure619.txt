This whole thing is probably a troll, but on the off chance that it's real, I might as well post in here. Whole lot of good could be done with that amount of money. Buy a house, pay of my debt/family/friends debt, invest... so many options.

It's a pipe dream, not a realistic goal. But it would be nice, and isn't impossible.

Yeah, I don't mind losing $750.

That's a shame. I'd think that anyone investing would be critical of their investing platforms.

Indeed it is, but I assume that people here can maintain an unbiased opinion. Am I wrong in that assumption?

Oh I know I'll have to sit on it for sure. That is a given. I plan to invest ~$100 per paycheck into BTC for the foreseeable months. I just have $750 to slap down on it now in a lump.

Slapping ~$750 down on a 1-time investment doesn't seem like it requires too much knowledge, other than knowing which contenders seem fittest to invest in. If I'm to buy BTC or any of the others, the time is now, as I can't go back in time. Ergo, it's a good time to invest in one, but which? BTC, ETH etc is the question.

I'm paying them down, but I want to see if I can accelerate the pay down via invested capital. I don't think I'll lose money on the $750 invested, but I also don't think I'll make near enough to pay down the loans in a huge lump.
