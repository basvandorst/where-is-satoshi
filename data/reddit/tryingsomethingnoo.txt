Thanks for the heads-up. I was looking around because Coinbase had just abruptly suspended my ability to buy with no explanation. I was Level 3 with both direct bank and a debit card verified, then one day I was unable to buy. I emailed customer support, and they wrote back saying it was fixed, and sure enough, it is. 
I really just wanted to have another option, in case Coinbase decide to be weird again. It isn't a matter of life and death, but it would make me feel warm and fuzzy to have a backup. Both Binance and Kraken were being difficult, repeatedly rejecting the required selfie for silly reasons ("your left hand isn't fully visible" etc) so I really just wanted an alternate other than the numerous ATMs that charge 6.5%. 
I respect and appreciate how diligent the fiat &lt;--&gt; crypto exchanges need to be, but cripes, it got silly. At least Coinbase didn't play Simon Says, a couple quick photos and bank approvals and they were satisfied. I never buy more than $1,000 at a time anyway, and never sell. 
Anyway, enough ranting, I appreciate your advice.

I hadn't tried calling because of the "...if your account has been hacked" crap. Are you saying they will actually help? That is great news if true...

Thanks for the reply. How difficult is it to qualify for Active Trader, and what is the difference in fees?

Can you buy through Wasabi and Samurai, or is it through Simplex or some other third party?

Really? So a major fluctuation won't screw buyers?
I don't know about 5 days, last night Coinbase told me my funds would be available on July 21St. I was shocked that they are going to freeze my money for that long, but after looking around on the web and here on Reddit, multiple weeks seems to be fairly common.

Does this affect just traders, or will it change things significantly for those of us who simply use Gemini as an alternative to Coinbase for simply purchasing less than $1000 in coins at a time for paying bills and the like?
