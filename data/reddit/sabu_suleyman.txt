You can back test it on S&amp;P data for a a few decades.
Make sure to do a Monte Carlo simulation looking at different beginning and ending dates and varying investment frequency (weekly, monthly) and look at average of all outcomes to be your expected ROI value.
Beats most hedge funds out there. 
Plenty of papers  with a quick google.

Nobody can answer the question - " When is a good time to buy?"
A simple and effective strategy for the longer term would be to buy 1BTC every Sunday at 10 am for 4 weeks without looking at the price.
A form of systematic investment plan(SIP).

Proven and time tested. Warren buffet is a fan.
I do the same on a weekly basis. Coinbase even has an option for setting up a SIP

If you are after a small amount - localbitcoins.com
Otherwise Coinjar and Coinbase are both good too.
Depending on the city you live in there could be a bitcoin ATM close by too (little expensive but quite convenient)

Saving the “opportunity cost” is an income.
If I don’t spend $10 on sending $1000 through Western Union and instead use bitcoin and it’s costs me $0.5 - the bitcoin has by definition produced value worth $9.50 to me.
A penny saved is penny earned. 
That is my “income” , if you wanna  use that term, from using bitcoin.
You are too fixated on textbook terminologies like dinosaur buffet is. He is too old and technically illiterate to understand the bitcoin technology.
He should stick to Coca Cola stocks.

Try reading my comment again.
Bitcoin is a value producing asset.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:01:44
Warrren hasn’t done his homework.
In his world , email is not a value producing asset either.

All the coins can never be mined - exponential curves.

That’s not how you check - not with “one” sample.
It could be pure random luck with one - can go up or go down.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
To check - you would have to look at a reasonably large number of trades, see what’s the average return from them and compare it to the case where you had just hodled.
Here is a good read : 
Technical trading is like running around a tree for hours and then saying you have done a lot of “work”.

Technical Analysis is as scientific as Astrology.
All he chart shows is what has already happened, no more.

You clearly don’t understand my statement.
Warren Buffet is a dinosaur , a black swan.
Bitcoin produces value by allowing storing value and transferring value at a very low cost.
