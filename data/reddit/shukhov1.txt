Hmm.  I'm using the Chrome GreenAddress running on my pc and I don't see anything about handlers.  My settings sections are (sorry for the long list): currency, sound, language, email, quick login, 3rd party linkk, notifications, privacy, 2 factor, auto logout, show mnemonic, nlocktime, spending limits, and some account stuff.

Ah, I should have guessed. Thanks for the consideration. I usually use the Chrome app because it seems more secure. There's always these usability/security tradeoffs.

oh, so, when it reports the wallet total it is just a calculation?  What you say makes sense.  So wallets like GreenAddress would have to create an api for other applications to get at this data.

I think I'm beginning to catch on.  So, to get, say,  functionality, it would have to be built into GreenAddress itself.  Is that correct?

I'm going to give breadwallet a try: I've heard a lot of good things about it.  Thanks!

Well, this is strange: I've been trying to send this bitcoin for almost a month and getting the same error.  Without doing anything different I just tried it again and it worked.  fyi: I saw this error using  on a pc running chrome &amp; firefox and os x using safari.  I submitted the problem using hives reporting feature (the "Support" button).  Thanks for responding.
