No, that is market manipulation and is illegal.

You didn't say anything about the qatar sheik. Wall Street loves bull market, they go with the trend. Trend is up, they are going to pump this up. If they try to short and everyone BTFD, they will be caught with their pants down and guess what, they cover and price moons. Why short when they can make just as much, if not more, going with the trend.

Not sure if you will get them shipped in time, but check this website out. I gave some out last Christmas to my nieces and nephews and they were sort of well received.

The futures market is not being created for miners and holders to hedge, at least not initially. The futures market is a way for institutional investors to get in on the bitcoin action without having to worry about private keys and hacks. All contracts are cash settled, meaning no bitcoins will be delivered, rather they will look at bitcoin prices at expiry and exchange cash. If hedge funds are  buying btc right now, they cannot manipulate price by selling futures, then selling btc to cause a crash to cash in on their futures. With the way btc is running, there is only one way to trade futures.

I had thousands of Magic cards in 1995. After high school I forgot about them until a couple of years ago when my niece told me she played Magic. I was like people still play...

Did you claim your bitcoins? Are students talking about them and any buzz generated or is it more like, cool how do I get 100 bucks cash for these?

If you are still working at the company sponsoring the 401(k) plan, you will need to check if you are able to rollover money while you are still working. If allowed, you can rollover to a self-directed IRA or start your own profit sharing plan and rollover into that plan. When looking for a self-directed IRA or starting your own profit sharing plan, make sure it allows for regular/Roth rollovers and make sure it allows for any type of investments - commodities, real estate, bitcoins, etc. Then just do it!
It will have to be a self-directed IRA and not just a regular IRA since most IRAs (just like your 401k) will not allow for "non-regular" investments.

If we found a way to make gold or found a huge deposit of gold somewhere in the world or on the moon, the price of gold would most likely plummet. Look at the history of pearls. Once people were able to farm cultured pearls, the price dropped. Part of what makes gold valuable is its relative scarcity. Bitcoin has enough useful properties and is scarce, so more likely than not, it will hold some value going forward unless there is a fatal flaw in the code.

First, good for you!
Second, since the IRS considers bitcoin as property, you may be able to defer taxation on the capital gains if you set up the purchase of your home as a 1031 exchange. Talk to your accountant/lawyer.
Refer to IRS Notice 2014-21:

Warren Buffet is a legendary investor in the old fashioned markets. He does not know the bitcoin market. He told people to "stay away" from bitcoin.
Recently he has admitted he was wrong about GOOGL and AMZN. He sticks with what he knows the KO, IBM, insurance companies and newspaper companies.
But who knows, just put money you can afford to lose and see where the crytpo world takes you. I truly believe serious money has not yet made their way into the crypto universe.

Bitcoin needs smart, resourceful people to disagree, attack and attempt to hijack it. What does not kill bitcoin only makes it stronger from here on out.
