As a  6 figure a year business owner, which is pretty small fries, I would never use bit coin alone.
I would accept it only if it could be immediately cashed out and the buyer covers all price variations.  
I can't hold it because I'd the price drops I cant resupply inventory. I cant spend it because that involves holding it.  Theres zero regulations or help for me if i lose money from bitcoin or in cases of fraud.
Bitcoin lost a fuck ton more than 5 percent just in the last year.  If I had been running bitcoin as my primary currency I'd have gone out of business.

If you have several small businesses I question whether these are businesses or hobbies because some of this is pretty basic stuff.
Let's take retail and sales of any kind where you have to get the inventory and you sell it to your consumers.
Customer spends 3k with you for some items that you pay say 2500 for all in. A cool $500 profit for you.  Not bad.  They paid you in bitcoin though.  You can't pay your vendor in bitcoin, so you have to convert it.  However, in the time they paid you, and the time you went to convert and place your order the price has dropped 10%.  Now you only have 2700 instead of 3k. You lost 300 bucks due to fluctuations.  Something that just about never happens with an actual currency such as....the USD.  This makes it impractical as a currency since you can't really buy things, and you HAVE to sell instantly if you want to guarantee it stores it's value. 
This is especially true when you get into higher dollar amounts where that drop of bitcoin could be high enough to make it where you no longer even have enough money to fill the order you have for your customer.  Once that happens, youre done if you dont have savings to cover the lass.  Simply put, you can't run a business off of speculative investments which is all bitcoin is at present time.
As far as manipulation?  We see it all the time.  Someone who owns enough coin can buy and sell and the simple act of them doing so will move the entire market.  You can see this for yourself through pumping and dumping, then rebuying when it crashes and doing it over again.  Not sure if you remember the shenanigans of BearWhale back in 14 in bitcoin. Then there's the rinse and repeat.  Whale sells a tiny portion of their holdings for below market rates which always sends a portion of holders into selling mode to protect their "investment"  (Not not currency lol).  When the price dips down, that whale just rebuys. You can see this by the simple fact that the vast majorijty of bitcoins are held by a very small amount of people.
Now everything in the last few paragraphs talks about how prices go up and down for various reasons, which is yet another reason it's not a currency, isn't being treated as a currency, and isn't being used as a currency.  Nothing that can go up and down 10% or more in a day, week, month, or few hours is suitable as a currency.  Objectively, it's a terrible currency and that's not an opinion.  That's the simple fact of the matter.   The fact that you can sit there and admit that it IS risky is you agreeing with me in action, but apparently not your mind and words.   Nothing risky is useful as a currency. It's useful as an investment tool, just like stocks ;)  
As a business owner, you need to know whatever assets you get today are still there tomorrow.  Especially when it comes to goods and services as you may have employees or vendors to pay, things to buy, overhead to meet...and if your bitcoin has a bad day, you could simply bankrupt your business and be unable to pay.  There's a fucking reason no business pays peoples salaries in stocks. 
This sub has too many fan boys who just promote blindly and completely ignore or gloss over the glaring issues.  You did the same thing here.  I mean really?  You truly dont believe that there is price manipulation on a giant unregulated financial market even when you can look at it happening in real time if you wanted?  Hoooooo boy.  Either you really need to do some research on your own or youre arguing in bad faith on this.    I legitimately do not know what.
Now lets take some other random examples of how it's useless as a currency for most people.  I want to get quick bite to eat near the train station.  My train arrives in a couple of minutes.  Enough time for me to buy something, pay with cash or card and go on my way.  WIth bitcoin I have to wait a while for everything to process. By then it's likely that I may have missed my train, or at the very least, spent several minutes of time waiting for my payment to be verified by the seller.  This is super impractical for most businesses.  This is great for hey, im selling you this stained glass item you really want because you really want it.  its terrible for, I need this thing, and I dont want to spend more time paying for this thing than the time it took to get it.  These few minutes ads up over time and is a tax.  I value my time pretty high, but for the sake of the conversation, lets say I value my time at $20 an hour.  With an average time of lets just say, 1 minute to confirm a transaction (im being super generous here as you know) that means every 60 items I spent an extra $20 in time.  Not to mention that you can't finish a transaction at a business until it processes. So this results in longer lines, less money for that business, and a worse customer experience.  So it's not just MY $20 in time being wasted, its many others money, time, and customers as wel.  This is going go be a lot more than $20.  
Or they could all pay cash or credit and be in and out immediately without wasting time.  
Bitcoin requires internet!  Not everyone has internet.  Service is not everywhere.  Even credit cards have a system in place for areas without internet if the business needs it.  If I take a ride somewhere and I need to pay my taxi driver but i dont have service, how the fuck am I going to do that? He gonna let me go on the honor system? Probably not.  Im gonna have to borrow money, use cash like usual, or find service somewhere and then wait for the payment to process and validate.  Yeah, no, that sounds like it's doable, but utterly nonsense when you realize you can just pay with cash or a card and be on your merry way.
I could do examples of this all day long.  
Now factor in what people are ACTUALLY using bitcoin for right now.  Looks like the vast majority of transactions and money moving around is all for investment purposes!  Not for purchasing and selling things, but for investments.  How can you sit and argue "well that's just your opinion man" when just about everyone else using bitcoin is using it not for currency, but for investing related things?

 you're also glossing over the fact that you're getting a lot more customers because you accept credit card than you would ever get just doing cash.
 you are absolutely not debating in good faith here. 
 in addition if you are a retail restaurant or similar establishment I guarantee you have more theft on your cash transactions than you do on credit card transactions and the only way to find out is to pay a good amount to monitor and pay someone to watch videos ot show up and audit covertly.

 what makes you think anybody is paying 8% to a credit card processor and what makes you think the business owner pays?  Thats included in the price.   Higher processing fees means higher cost to the customer.

 I guess it's not obvious to people who haven't ran businesses. And this isn't a knock at you but that explains why you can't see it.
Theft is big. A credit card forces a receipt transaction.  Kinda hard to steal with a card 
I do audits for bars, hotels,restaurants, and parking garages.     Literally all of them require me to use cash because cash transactions are where the loss occurs.  They pay us auditors for several rounds of drinks, or an entite hotel stay, parking... plus a payment because that costs them less money as a company because we root out thieves. one of the most common ways to steal at any of these locations is to just never ring up the order in the first place or to reuse a receipt that a prior customer left.
 I busted a six-person theft ring at a parking garage at a fancy hotel in downtown Chicago last year.
 we did the rough math that they were stealing at least 40 to $100 a day by charging customers less money for parking then was displayed but only taking cash and never ringing it in.   the customer will never complain about this because they're getting half off $70 parking in Downtown Chicago.  That's where Auditors like me come in and report it.   this company was losing  tens of thousands of dollars a year in this type of theft. 
As a small business owner myself I don't want to go to the bank, I don't want to count money, I would much rather have that time to work on my actual business or to spend time at home regardless of how much my salary is.

 at 2.9% processing fee which is what my business pays that would be $58.  
 You pay more than the bartender and you definitely arent counting 2k in 5 minutes solo.  Have you ever done a cash count before?
Youre also paying the night manager to count at end of day.   then you're paying for whoever does the deposit to bring to the bank including the time to go to the bank.  
 sure you could buy a money counting machine but that's going to cost you some several hundred or a thousand plus.
 This scenario also assumes but these people are running around with cash vs the reality that many will opt to go elsewhere.  Taking cards increases sales.

 yes but how does this help if they don't ring it up at all? A credit card forces a transaction Because the customer has to sign something in the receipt needs to match the transaction. What's stopping that employee from taking the money and still providing a service or product?
@_date: 2019-10-12 00:33:19
What makes you think you cant dispute an in person card transaction?
Youre completely mistaken.  You can contest any transaction.
Edit:  Downvote me all you want. I worked in card services at chase. I have first hand experience.  Disputes can be done for things like not accepting a return within a certain time frame, not honoring advertised prices, warranties, return policies and much much more and all of those things do not care whether it was an online order, an in person transaction or wahtever.
Not only that, but much fraud occurs IN PERSON with a stolen card.  most places never card you or check signature anyway.
@_date: 2019-10-11 23:47:09
 that's because I intentionally listed the two things that definitely do not scale. Are you daft?  I even said that lol. 
Counting money scales.  I had cash counts for only a few grand take at least 15 to 20 but sometimes as much as an hour.  And that's done by the till owner.  The closing manager.  The deposit/opening manager.  Meanwhile credit cards i push a few buttons and wait for the automated reconciliation and im done.
Storage for money increases with safe size or armored vehicle.
Theft is super hard with credit cards.  More cash transactions provides a theft opportunity with every order.  This is why companies spend thousands of dollars a year on mystery shopping programs to catch employee theft.  More cash means more stealing.  This is the biggest cost in cash.
Recording and accounting for finances takes longer with more cash transaction as card is all basically automated.
@_date: 2019-10-11 21:12:21
 at my last audit I had to go to the bar in order a very common drink just a cranberry vodka in this case.  I had to pay cash. and I had to take a discreet photo of the receipt but leave it there.
 I then had to do this two more times over the next hour and a half with the exact same order.
This employee recycled the same receipt for two of my three Cash transactions. Total theft 16 bucks.  Now say this employee does this two or three times a shift.
@_date: 2019-10-11 21:00:57
Business owner here and former store manager.
No they arent.  Your fixed costs are the daily trip to the bank and any register related stuff. More cash just increases costs in almost all areas. It all scales.
As a small business owner cash is incredibly inconvenient.   it's pretty obvious that you haven't had any significant business. 
Do you also realize how much additional work there is for taxes and such with cash that is automated and simple with credit cards?    
The less cash the better.

See this is where I can shine!
I have a gas furnace, but i live on a third story and no one directly around us except one side is our height.  So we get all the wind and I have beautiful tall front windows all across the front of the house at the living room.  But that also means that room is always so fucking cold.  So we picked up a space heater for each bedroom and they probably get used about 8 to 12 hours a day each on low.  During those hours the furnace is totally shut off.  We dont heat over half of the property, and the least efficient ones at that.  Each person uses a space heater as needed.  My gf and I usually dont turn it on. It hasn't gotten below 57 inside our room yet and under the covers at night that's fine for us.  
The idea behind this is we only really heat the rooms we are using.  If one of us goes to the living room, the space heater comes with.  If someones gone, they dont have anything on at all.  It doesn't efficiently heat your entire home, but it definitely efficiently heats vs doing the entire place.

Not trying to rain on your parade, but no business is going to be doing massive bitcoin purchases b2b with it as unstable as it is.  It's unsuitable to collect payment for something that 10 minutes later might be anywhere from zero to minus 10%.  
I accept bitcoin from my customers, but only if I am online to immediately convert it to USD as soon as I get it.  I cant' afford the risk of the price dropping when I'm running a business.  
If you want bitcoin to be mainstream, it has to be something that has a stable price and can be functionally used.  If all you can do is hodl, then there's really no value there.  Hodling is useless if it's supposed to be a currency.

I'm a legitimate business and I wont use cyrpto because using crypto is like me accepting stocks for sales.  It's impossible to know if that money is going to be worth what I need it to be a day later and fluctuates constantly. That's literally the last thing I want in a form of payment.  I dont want to be paid something today and find out my payment is now worth 25% of the value tomorrow.  
Had I accepted bitcoin for all of my purchases the other year when it went up to 20k, id have gone out of business in the crash right after the holidays because I would have been flush with coin, and not flush with inventory as I had sold it all off during the holidays.  Now instead of my 5k turning into 20k profit through hard work, my 20k turned into 5k so I worked hundreds of hours or free and didn't make any money at all and also have little to no inventory to start over.    
Nevermind the fact that whales can alter the price of bitcoin at will through large buys or sells if they so choose. Hell no im not accepting bitcoin or any other currency that is unstable.  Fiat, cyrpto, or otherwise.

"*No true Scotsman* or appeal to purity is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample."  
The OP treated all "fiat' as one monolithic thing, and I did the same with crypto as a counter example.

I dont think I agree with most of your post . I dont even care what your profit is nor do I need to know.  You can't do most of your business in anything that wildly fluctuates hourly and daily unless your margins/reserve cash can cover changes of 50% or more which is kind of fucking ridiculous. 
let's take your 25% of your customer base.  Had they all paid at the peak of crypto for 20k and the price dropped by more than 50% just about any business who was going all in on crypto would have been bankrupt or out a shit load of fucking bread.  
When I say stable I know that a 10k payment given to me in USD is still worth 10k USD and will buy the same order from my supplier as it did a month ago.
That's not bitcoin.  That same purchase at ATH vs now would be half as much inventory able to be bought.  
This is not a rock and hard place thing.  It wont be stable until it's regulated, and regulating it takes away from what people wanted it to be in the first place.  
Your last paragraph makes zero sense.  If you have  a million dollars in profit, and 250k is bitcoin and 750k is USD at the time of payment, the next day bitcoin could be down 10% and worth only 225k and your 750k is still standard USD with the same buying power.  You've lost 25k due to nothing more than volatility we dont see in just about any currency.  Youre gambling, and gambling is not a viable long term way to run a business.  
I dont see how people paying in fiat are covering those losses.  Those losses are yours.  You incurred them as soon as you took bitcoin and the price dropped. 
Youre basically trying to suggest that people should be paying in stocks which are inherently risky for a reason. You cannot operate a business on risky money for long term viability.

I'm simply arguing that it IS possible if governments really wanted to do it but completely cutting it from the financial system and make it illegal/expensive for companies, individuals, or businesses to use.
If you aren't a miner how does one get bitcoin?   What happens if businesses and banks aren't allowed to accept or interact with bitcoin if they passed regulations doing as much? 
What good is having a bunch of bitcoin when you can't convert it to something people want because the government has decided to throw the hammer down on it and if you cant' buy anything with it because businesses aren't allowed to accept it as payment.  
THere are certainly ways for bitcoin to be crushed by bad regulation.  That's my only argument, not that they are hard or difficult or even that it will happen.  Just that it can.  
Sure, a business owner could accept a payment in bitcoin.  Now they have untraceable, illegal to spend bitcoin,and now has to find some other business that will accept it from them?  and so on and so forth, all of which would unravel under any audit. 
Just saying, it only takes the wrong people with the will to do it.

Further, control &lt;&gt; ownership.  I can borrow a car from my mom and I control it.   I do not own it..
I can deliver a pizza and during that time I am controlling it.  But I do not own it.
I can control and operate a business, but I do not own it.
The list goes on and on.  Control and ownership are two completely and mutually exclusive concepts.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:25:36
Seriously?  
What happens when they pass regulations that banks cannot do transactions for bitcoin purchases if they wanted to ban it?  
Once banks can't interact with bitcoin exchanges or what have you youre going to see a completely different situation.
If youre thinking that governments can't do anything about it you're sadly mistaken. ITs simply a matter of if they are willing to go that far.

Im an Airbnb host and have had several venezuelans stay with us.  Every one was well off for the area, and said the same thing.  Anyone with the means to get out, has gotten out.
You seem determined to accuse people of lying though.  The world is a big place, and the rest of the world doesn't operate or work in the same way as your location.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:54:36
Yes because the world is teeming with people who will go out of their way to go pay for bitcoin using gift cards from other businesses only to not be able to spend the bitcoin anywhere?
Give me a fucking break.  
You'll also note that your example is one I expressly cited as an example that would NOT work in banning bitcoin ;)  Thank you so much for reiterating a point I had already made.

You guys really need to stop linking this for christ sakes.  This is not how it works with the vast majority of items on amazon anymore.  almost none of them are like this nowadays.  
You can look this crap up on their site.
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:23:28
Man.  Paying to rent equipment always pisses me off.  Ugh.  
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:23:31
This is not what is happening here.  
Very very few items are commingled. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:16:50
That's not the official ledger store.  That's just a listing. 
Everyone who is selling that item must sell the item on that listing. &gt; If you look towards the bottom there are 90 other people selling the ledger.
It doesn't sound like amazon did anything wrong unless you specifically bought only from the official ledger account on that listing of 90 people.  
What I am guessing happened is you bought from a third party seller and they were trying to scam and since amazon doesn't personally check items they shipped it to you as they were supposed to.  Remember, amazon only does logistics unless they are also the seller of the item.  Their policies to protect you kick in when buyers report the sellers.
Edit:  actually, you need to go into your actual order and look.  That screen shot says it was sold by ledger official, but that's not who you bought it from necessarily Look at your actual order transaction and see what it says on the transaction log as being the seller. 
If it's ledger official thats' probably a return, if it's not, then it's a scam by the third party seller probably.  (although it could be an honest mistake for that seller too)
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:13:58
Yes.  Easily.  
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:27:29
So we're both accurate from where we are speaking from.  I agree, if there's no need to exchange, sure.  If I knew that no matter what happened to bitcoin over the next month that my .000012 widget is still going to be that much I would be very comfortable using it.  But bitcoin is purely linked to fiat so it doesn't matter if I have the same amount of bitcoin.  Due to it's instability, no one can really price in it in the first place.  
Until that gets fixed I dont know what you can do.  + once it's popular youre just going to get hit with some kind of tax or exchange fee to get into bitcoin just like a normal currency trade.  Mark my words.  :(
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:23:01
I'm replying at other spots but now that I see this is from ledger official my opinion has adjusted slightly.  This would have been a return like you thought. If the person did a return it can get sent back into the sellers inventory as eligible for sale.  
(meaning no damage and to them it looks like its fine) they may have thought this was still a new item and simply made it eligible for resale.  The way amazon does its removal off the shelf there's almost a zero percent chance that they "grabbed the wrong item"   Everything is directly linked to a barcode, so if the barcode on the item they picked up doesn't match what it should based on the sellers inventory submission to amazon...then they wouldn't send it out.  It's all dont with scanners.  
I often get things sent back to my inventory that I end up getting feedback claiming it was used.  That's the only real answer I have for explaining it that fits.  
Sorry this happened to you!!

I feel like most of the people downvoting this comment thread don't really operate a significant business.  If I had been running any business during the end of the year and based my operations off bitcoin I would have lost my companies when the price crashed from 20k down.  I simply would not have had the money to survive. The price still hasn't recovered.  
Like this actually happened yet people are still arguing it would be fine for a business.
Im not some huge baller, but I do six figures in all 5 of my companies combined.  I'm telling you that it would have crushed all of them except my airbnb business but thats soley due to that being a service that doesnt' require me getting goods.  I would have worked for dirt cheap, but the business would have been fine.
Everything else I do is retail related.  I would have been stuck with inventory I was selling for 25% to 50% of what I paid for it and no way to make a profit on any of it not to mention anything I had in savings would have reduced value by over 50% due to the drop price. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:32:25
I dont think im missing the point.  I'm just looking at it very practically.
Right now, nothing is priced in bitcoin.  Anywhere. And if it is, it's directly linked to how it's doing against fiat.  For the sake of simplicity lets pretend that I have a widget I can buy for exactly 1 bitcoin based on the current price of bitcoin.  I sell it for 2 bitcoin to customers and people buy it all day long.
That widget might only cost me 1 bitcoin today, but tomorrow the value of bitcoin may go down, so it's going to cost me more than that 1 bitcoin since I'll need to add more bitcoin to cover the difference.
Meanwhile, if I were using dollars.  I wont have that issue at all.   Ever. Unless of course you think the currency is going to collapse and that's incredibly unlikely for the foreseeable future so I'm not going to delve into any arguments that rely on that.
If bitcoin were stable, then it wouldn't be gambling anymore.  You can't operate a company for long term success if youre gambling on it's income and profits.  (generally speaking)
My analogy regarding stocks was that they can and often do fluctuate wildly day to day alone.  
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:14:28
What was the name of the specific seller on amazon you bought from?
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:02:54

I'm not saying anyone should believe him.  I'm simply stating the information is incomplete so the truth is still a mystery.  
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:55:35
What is he selling?  I did a cursory glance through his post history. He seems to be trying to get people to bet him he's wrong using an escrow service which isn't the same thing as selling something.
What's the scam?  What's his end game?
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:48:02

Hey, i haven't said anything mean about you or to you.  As I said.  I don't even have a miner and have other side gigs.  Bitcoin is something I'm interested in, and this story interests me.  Right now though, it's just a story.  When I see evidence to support the claims I'll definitely move to the affirmative column.  I gain or lose nothing beyond satisfying my own curiosity.  
I hope youre being straight, personally.  
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:25:31
He could be asking you to post so everyone actually sees it.  If he's looking for the excitement of proving someone wrong, there ya go.
I'm basing my thoughts off of what has been proven, not what is likely.   Youre asking me to believe your view without proof that youre correct.  You feel your correct, but  feels aren't proof.  
I'm swayed by data.  So although I may feel that youre right, I cannot possibly rule out that you are in fact wrong because the evidence available hasnt' supported it yet.  
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:43:18
So what the fuck is he scamming? He's not asking for any money he's not asking for anyone to buying anything? Based off of what he's posted and my background in sales and wholesale buying what he saying makes a lot of sense. I'm not so good on the bit coin side of things but I do know how to sell shit  And what he's doing buying in bulk is how I do things. You get nice discounts as a wholesaler, plus you don thave to pay taxes when you buy.
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:58:46
Ive looked through his history.  He seems confrontational and wants to argue with people and prove them wrong, but I dont see him trying to sell anyone anything.
If you can tag me on any of his posts where he's' doing more than trying to get people to bet that he is wrong I would be interested.
I can tell you with 100% certainty what he described for buying a lot of miners at once and reselling for profit while using them to mine is a completely valid sales tactic.    WHen I buy wholesale I get 40-50% off retail prices and then I can resell for less than what other people can who only bought, say 10 to my 100.  Maybe at 10 miners they only got 10% off, and since I bought 100 or maybe 1000 or some shit they were 30-40% off.  (I'm just using this as an example, I have no idea if these percentages are accurate in this particular case)
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:56:27
He's certainly bragging, but selling or scamming?  
If he's not selling things cheaper than they can get elsewhere, it doesn't' matter if he's selling miners because they will buy from elsewhere.  it didn't look like he was selling miners to anyone here or offering that.
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:04:57
I have no idea if he's being honest, I can speak from the sales side of things where he talks about how he makes money on the miners.  That part passes the smell test.  
On the other hand though as an objective third party, I dont see any evidence to support his entire story.  The photos are very much not nearly enough evidence. they only support bits and pieces, and not the whole picture.
I still maintain he's not actually selling anything though, so the obvious motivations are not here for a scam.
