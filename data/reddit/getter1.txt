My concern is that if something like coinbase gets hacked, a hardware wallet isn't going to help save my money because btc would be set back for yeeeaaaaars

Can I set up stop orders from a offline wallet?

They are just looking for a reason to hate something they didn't invest in.  Keep up that tribal mentality.  Bch is fine, stop being cunts about it.
I am starting to hate the people who bitch about Ver as much as I hate Ver. And I hold both btc and bch.  Grow up dudes.

but how can I set top limits at 19k and then rebuy at 16k if my money is stuck in a usb stick?

I've got enough to buy several btc, but i'm not because i worked too long and too hard to risk it. and i'm buying a house next year.  I'm happy with my fraction of a btc and have set up recurring buy ins to treat it like a 401k.  I guess its all how you want to view it. Its all situational.  If you have short term goals with the money you currently have, then don't be so risky, but if you could lose a big chunk of that 17k and not be squeezed financially, then yea do it.  I could invest my life savings and pray for $1m btc by 2020, but it would be the dumbest thing to do ever.  Yea, i may regret not doing that if it does moon, but .5 btc would also be a decent chunk of change as well which could set me up for my current lifestyle for a loooooooooong time.
tbh though, i had more anxiety out of FOMO than i have with the recent dips.  I'm still slightly in the green, and even if it goes in the red, i know it wont change my plans that I have in store in the short term.  If it plummets, eh, fuck it, I can survive.  If it moons, then I can live comfy in my own little way :)

If Roger wasn't involved in Bcash would you guys still be so against it?
