Well to be honest this was just a thought experiment by myself. But I might actually start to look into the logistics of such a product.
I think if I wanted to be serious about this I could put together a business plan complete with design documentation, a rough working prototype and a complete product backlog of user stories for features.
I could then go to the bitcoin forums and see about the prospect of a bitcoin business loan from a longstanding respected forum member. Granted if I wanted to go this far, I would AT THE LEAST, need a working prototype, complete with USB key.

Interesting, I might try this out soon.

Seconding Bitcoin QT.
I've heard good things about Armory and I might check it out.
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:29:31
I might be downvoted for this, but I think this is a good thing. Now we get to see Bitcoin work as a real currency, and can no longer be used as a scapegoat for "funding terrorism and the drug trade".
I'm sure we will see some panic selling, but this will help legitimize the currency in the long run. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:15:20
I think you've got the idea.
@_date: 2013-02-17 18:22:24
Same here. Gotta get those GPU coins before ASIC wipes them out. I've got a Jalapeno pre-ordered, I'm hoping the start shipping within the next two weeks. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 04:11:23
That makes sense and those are all valid points given the context.
I know there have been a few posts recently where people have setup lunches with restaurants bringing in a large group of people. It might be interesting for you to look at local pizza places near you to try and find ones that are really popular and work from there.

I'm not sure I'd call this a crash. I think it's more so just a correction. You typically see these after long periods of record highs. 
Alternatively, you could actually be seeing the hype fall off. There was a chart I'd seen recently that showed the price jumping, then tanking, then normalizing to a new normal higher price, all while still driving forward in value.
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:10:28
Thanks! I'll probably prepare it myself in this function and use that information in a consultation session with a CPA.

I know with me I have a 7870 and I do see artifacting on screen, but this typically only happens when I'm using the computer while mining. I'm honestly not sure how to fix this problem myself, I think it's just something that can happen.
@_date: 2013-02-17 17:32:40
Let me put my tin foil hat on real quick.
Humor aside, you're probably right. Seeing that this sort of thing happens in USD markets all the time it's no surprise to see that this sort of thing can happen in any other market as well.
At least with mining you're always winning, I plan on keeping the coins I get from mining for a while.

They actually just started a recurring payment system. You're now able to say something like, "I want to buy 25 dollars worth of bitcoin every two weeks starting today." 
I plan on doing this as just another way of diversifying my assets.

I'm going to argue that while Coinbase has had some problems recently, they are VERY prompt with response to users and they have been going above and beyond support for some of the problems people have had. Also, as a user myself I've had very few problems since starting to use their site.
@_date: 2013-02-17 19:41:26
I calculated it out, and if they were to cash in all of the bitcoin from the shares they made (as of like 11am yesterday morning) it would have been like 30 grand.
@_date: 2013-02-21 04:19:19
Great! I've been using coinbase to sell coins from mining recently, and I've had nothing but great service and prompt fund transfers. (2-3 days each time)

Which he paid 1528.6 BTC for. 
It's still going to take a few more dividend payouts before he even breaks even, let alone starts making profits.

All I would recommend is making sure that the card is being cooled properly, other than that it's probably not that much of an issue.

I think it really depends on how quickly they will be able to pump out new units after this first initial batch.
Also a quick way to see all of his updates. (didn't know I could do that before posting this.)

Not necessarily. You have a mentality of people in markets where the word "bubble" is terrifying because it brings back memories of the housing bubble and the tech bubble, two actual events that were periods of real investments where use of the term bubble was actually correct.
It becomes a tool for those that want to use it as a manipulative bargaining chip to make massive profits when their "predictions" come true. At that point it just becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, not necessarily something that had real financial backing data behind it.

I think this is common with GPU mining. Basically you're stressing your card to its max and then you go and add actually using it while it's been stressed.
Depending on the miner you're using, they typically will have "desktop use" settings that allow you to mine and just use your computer at the same time. However if you're going to be gaming I would recommend not mining at the same time.
For example with GUIMiner, if you hover your mouse over the "Extra Flags" data entry field you'll see something like, "append -f 60 for desktop usage" or "without any params for desktop usage"
What miner and card are you using out of curiosity?

I made this for one of my classes as part of a "design the box" exercise for design vision.
However I must say, it would be cool if something like this could exist, but I imagine the legality of such a product would be somewhat murky.
@_date: 2013-02-21 03:37:11
So, question, and I'm being completely serious.
If we want Bitcoin to be a true revolution, why are we not focusing on local pizza joints instead of chains like Papa Johns? ESPECIALLY Papa Johns, which has horrible employee support and standards?
If we truly want to make a difference with bitcoins, shouldn't we be focused on helping the little guy instead of feeding right back into the massive megacorp central bank world?
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:32:34
What's the context on this?
@_date: 2013-02-17 06:07:13
I think mainly because of the fact that Bitcoin itself can't really by copyrighted? (At least I think?) And you would be dealing with attempting to sell a product that is utilizing open source software and an open source infrastructure.
The other problem would be pricing. If you're going to sell a product that will have a voucher for 10 bitcoins, how do you price it such that you're not completely losing your shirt if you as a company purchases a ton of bitcoin specifically for this purpose, if the price skyrockets or tanks (in relation to USD)?
@_date: 2013-02-21 08:22:54
There goes that "bubble" word again. 
This word can literally make people lose money. On January 25th, The Motley Fool submitted an article detailing what they considered to be a "bubble" in the 3D printer world. 
The very next day the stock price dropped 5 dollars and continued to drop like 12-13 dollars, just because one guy decided to say it was a "bubble". No doubt the guy had a shit ton of money in puts committed to this stock before he reported his news.
Don't try to call something a bubble just because you feel the price is too high. I personally feel like that's irresponsible and hasty.

The biggest difficulty of attracting new members is the lack of btc payment. Basically as a new user you have a lot of pools you can join with instant share credit and what not, but when a pool hasn't even made it's first solve, people are really wary about joining a new pool.
I'd say right now would be just about the best time to join this pool since we should be seeing a solve fairly soon, seeing as how we hit like 3.5 million shares today. (Current difficulty 3,275,465)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:14:33
Most of you answered my question. The basic premise being, "if the price is lower, will some people stop mining since the draw is presumably lower if the price tanks."
@_date: 2013-05-31 18:00:42
This is coming from a guy who owns an Avalon. So yes I'm sure he has a ton of BTC just lying around to do this with.

I know right? I actually just received 7 block Erupters this morning since canary dropped the price down to like .34 btc per.
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:42:32
And I'm going to guess in this specific context, at least for my case, that this would be short term capital gains since the assets were owned/held for less than 1 years time?
@_date: 2013-02-17 15:19:05
The main problem here is the timeframe.
The first batch of BFL gear won't be out until approximately 2 weeks (maybe) from now, and that only includes pre-orders from the first month and a half to two months of last year (june and july). 
Anything ordered now you presumably would not get until middle of May start of June and by then ASICS will have taken over, and a jalapeno at that time will arguably be mining at probably the same income level as two high level GPU cars (because of the rise in mining difficulty/possible halving).

I'm concerned that it will take them too long to prepare relevant guideline information within the frame of this years tax preparation season.
However I've always seen the IRS to have it's shit together a little bit more than most other government agencies.
@_date: 2013-02-17 19:36:34
My god, you're definitely going to be kicking some hash there. I didn't order my Jalapeno until like Feb 2nd, I'll be lucky if I see mine before June of this year rofl.

It depends, I would say if he was going to be mining to use Bitcoin QT.
But if he is only going to be purchasing bitcoin and purchasing goods and services with that bitcoin then something like blockchain.info might be the easiest way to go.
From personal experience, Bitcoin QT was easy to setup and I have had zero problems with it. Sure it takes a while to download the blockchain, but that's basically the ticket to entry.

I know this, but the more shares hashed, the closer you will be to finding a block, it's an eventuality at that point.
I would say in this particular instance, input like yours is already known and not really required. I don't think there is anyone out there naive enough to think that every block will be found when the number of shares matches up to the difficulty, it's still random chance.
