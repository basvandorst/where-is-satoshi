Sorry, but no! Everything that is on the left side will be bad for Bitcoin. The left will forbid things, overregulate and just in general piss off everyone, so big NOPE. I hope Trump gets re-elected and that many more countries will get people like him, Bolsonaro, Salvini, Orban, etc.

What is your main goal? Why would you want to hodl Bitcoins until 25 or 26? Why not until 30 or 40 or 20?
No matter how it is always worth it to hodl Bitcoin.

if you want to trade learn it first. Learn it good. Start with very small percentage of what you plan to put later on in there market and check what kind of percentage you usually win. Yes percentage not total amount. 
Go to tradingview and also do some paper trading. It is basically where you trade without owning nothing. Do it for at least a few months.

I will try to keep most of my BTC and when I hit my BTC target only then I might plan to sell what I earn in BTC as a result of daytrading.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:07:19
Altcoin is just a tool to get more Bitcoin. I never meant to say, that you should keep some Alts. I usually buy and sell some Alts the very same day, to increase my Bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:45:10
What if I told you that some traders trade not to get more FIAT, but to get more Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:46:37
Don't listen to the hodlers. I made more BTC thanks to trading than only hodling:  
1) Never trade BTC back to FIAT currencies
2) Trade into Altcoins that have a high volume (everything up from 50 BTC per day is good)
3) Don't do swing trading; due to the highly volatile movements of BTC it is highly unadvisable to wait and hodl up to few days and few weeks, because one little move can wreck your Altcoin position. 
4) Do daytrading, but have your own risk management. Can you afford to lose? Will you brush it off easily or feel heartbroken? Keep your emotions under control and you will be fine.
5) Do some pauses, once you get unexpectatly high gains, just don't trade for 1-2 days.
6) 13/34 moving average...man check that one as it is so powerful on the daily chart.
7) Set yourself an endgame, do you want to daytrade to increase your savings or do you want to make yourself independent?
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:18:44
It is ok if the market isn't for you and you prefer to hodl...
I bought some BTC, traded it back and forward with some Altcoins and got more BTC at the end of the day, without spending a single penny.

Look we are just starting a new bullrun and a new cycle. Sure we might reach 20k, perhaps have a few corrections here and there but then it will have higher targets. I see 100k as very likely and who knows maybe good ol McAfee might be right?
@_date: 2019-06-24 09:44:43
Now it is different and I think the 10k now is the 1k of before. After some years or even months people will complain about not buying in when it was only 10k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:25:57
So what? It is a correction...and hey if we look at it from a long term perspective Bitcoin is still considerably up. Don't get too nervous, we had many of these corrections in the past.

DONT just stay for the 'profit'. What will you do if it goes down? Panic sell it? Or actually hold it?   
Is Bitcoin and the idea behind Bitcoin something you identify with? 
Please for the sake of Bitcoin, ask yourself these questions... And hey what if the Dollar suddenly makes an hyperinflation? Will the 18000 still be worth it?
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:13:10
Day trading is less stressful. You do it for few hours, check which coins you wanna daytrade, quit with some more BTC and that's it, while swing trading is more stressful and the unexpected can hit you much harder. I had more success with day trading than swing trading.

@_date: 2019-06-27 09:23:04
Oh guys, what did you expect, a forever-enduring move to the upside? It is a smaller correction. It's much better we correct straight away to climb once more than to have blow off top.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:57:46
I smell like you are also one of those because you sound pretty frustrated about the price drop. Now don't you?

Did you ever try out the Stoch RSI, coupled with the MA 13 34 and MACD?
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:13:13
Yup. The good thing was that I traded with satoshis i collected from faucets, later converted to Dogecoins and used on unknown exchanges. Once I got more confident + read some books + watched some tutorials and made some classes I started to get better. And I always write a trading journal.
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:22:52
What I do with altcoins is to just use them to trade and when the time is right to get as much of BTC as possible. My endgame is to always have as much of BTC as possible. However the only altcoins I never truely sell are Dogecoins.
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:56:06

@_date: 2019-01-10 12:53:46
Check the technical aspects, Bitcoin was oversold if you check different charts and we are approaching new support and resistance levels. Also we are getting a similar formation as we had few months ago, so it was to be expected. Once the bulls are strong enough Bitcoin can recover. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:00:24
Trade in Altcoins and then trade back in BTC, it is more effective than just hodling. I never said you should trade in FIAT money.
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:36:32
Does a fan game count too? XD well technically Bitcoin is not really integrated in my Pokémon fan game, but it exists within the game.
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:54:31
Alts unfortunately do mimic Bitcoin too much, except for Dogecoin and Tron; these somehow tend to do their own thing.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:57:40
sure, but I keep the BTC, I don't trade back in FIAT money
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:29:15
Yep lost a bit, but hey... I just invested what I can afford to lose, so I can only blame myself.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:33:48

@_date: 2018-12-20 09:09:15
Not always. And you know that's true...
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:30:44
Wait a bit for some correction to happen, because no matter how much we believe in Bitcoin, nothing can climb forever. So a pull-back or a few red candle-sticks shouldn't be the end of the world.
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:52:21
XRP is not even a blockchain.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:21:08
That's not so much considering how high their profit was. They can easily cover it, but hey having cryptos in an exchange is always a risk, but then again having it on a hardware wallet is also a risk (you can lose your password and whatnot). Let them do their job and let's see how it continues.

Look man, talk about trading and gambling once you tried it for a longer while. Sorry, but I just can't take you serious. It is like hearing nocoiners telling me how Bitcoin is a pyramide scheme.
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:55:10
During, like hm 6 months, when I took trading more seriously, I made steady gains. Of course you lose sometimes, but most of the times I won.
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:16:00
Maybe it was, but I am not feeling bullish yet. I'd love to see a bit more volume.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:35:41
1) No it's not bullish, in fact watching it like this feels still very bearish to me.
2) TA is very very different. Although not everyone may like it, at least try to take it somewhat more serious if you really want to do some TA.
3) You don't provide an explanation of why it is bullish. Support? Resistance? RSI? Volume? MA? no explanation from your side why you see it as bullish.
@_date: 2018-12-19 09:02:35
Sure, why would people use Western Union to transfer cryptos? Only some fools would actually do that.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:27:45
You know that right now it is a lot of FOMO and that the STOCH RSI shows that it is waaayyyy too overbought.
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:32:33
that's what caused the sell wave? Give me a break...
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:42:17
Please FOMO buyers, please come at these heights! :D
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:39:39
We could also see it the other way around, at least all these people who didn't deserve to have Bitcoin in the first place or who were to naive, will get washed away OR learn a valuable lesson.   
BUT, you can also do margin trading and win some more BTC. Not everyone is losing, if they know how to deal with it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:02:26
You know exactly what my point is. 
Just check the weekly STOCH RSI.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:09:50
Try getting some Pundi X and let it for a few weeks. We are right now on a good way of crossing the 13/34 MA and volume is looking good, still oversold, so that's what you can try. I would also check out Holochain, BTT and Dogecoin. As for BTT you might already have missed to boat, while Holochain is an option and for Dogecoin...I mean it is Doge so it will jump in a few days/week from here on.
@_date: 2019-05-20 08:57:04
not true, I bought a fraction of a Bitcoin and could more than double it within some months. The trick is to trade between BTC and Altcoins. At the end of the day you have more BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:52:14
the market is just full of weak hands...
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:54:44
That's like the 83957895749634930th dump AGAIN...
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:55:59
What would be the use of it? There is already Steem for it, if you are into that type of coins.
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:02:54
Even so it's way too overbought... Would still wait a little bit if you want to make a max of profit. But hey, buying Bitcoin is never a bad thing, just use the money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:12:15
I know, I was referring to people who converted forcefully into HODL'ers, those you know who made credits, loans etc to buy Bitcoins and who 'HODL' for so long that they can make a profit.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:39:01
TELL ME WHERE!!! I wanna buy it at 3k!!!
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:56:28
I'd say wait until Bitcoin drops again below 3000€ and accumulate a bit. We might see another dip and I'd urge you to check the support level you are most comfortable or patient with. Keep in mind that most corrections still had a larger number %-wise than this correction. So there is still some room left. I think the move which happened yesterday is just a drop on a hot stone, so I am still bearish.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:12:19
A pullback is nothing that should scare us. So most people want to wait for a pullback, which is normal.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:39:46
Sure I wish so too, but I think going to the moon needs more than a pattern.

Why do you think trading is gambling? If it is about 'predicting the future' then hodling also doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:08:00
Of course you can! Only bc YOU disapprove trading doesn't mean it is bullshit.
Made more BTC by trading than buying with FIAT
