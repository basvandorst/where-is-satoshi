that wallet has 0 coins, but if you do a little trace, it seems that coins were transferred to "hot storage" instead of "cold storage".

I sent a support email and the response took about 2 days, just as a reference...

not settling, wait for tomorrow

Already submitted a ticket, but I think the response time won't be enough since 600 in the queue will mostly get to 0 today or tomorrow

I think they might be lost into the void. Also, having them in many 50 BTC accounts is a smart move because if somehow, although unlikely, someone generated a private key to a 1 million BTC address, that would insta-kill bitcoin.

I meant to express that people around here gets very anxious when bitcoin isn't reaching sky high values or dropping to new lows. For the last hour it has been "stable" and I'm sure that most are waiting for BTC to drop so they can get in or hoping it will rise as fast as the last bubble.

Pretty straightforward. I think QR codes are missing, also you could generate short addresses if your purpose is that people within your site can send to each other. 
Also, have you tested it? Like the basic stuff, such as sending btc from one of the generated wallets to another "external" address and not losing the change due to poor change address implementation?

maybe this year, maybe the next. A good portion of the people (including myself) think that it will settle at 30-50 for now.

Hello, I'm from Chile!. First of all, why bitcoin? I mean, I see it as an instrument of investment or trading, but not for short term saving. Too risky right now, you could end with half what you have in August. Second, getting a job here is very easy I think, we have the lowest unemployment rates in 20 years, so you could start getting your SO to help you find one before you get here. Where are you right now? If you are from South America, you can even make a sacrifice and get here in a bus, it takes an eternity and you will have to switch in many countries but it's about 50% cheaper than a plane ticket.

I think you are correct, but then there's the individual who thinks that can download some software at sourceforge, upload it to his/her hosting account and run an exchange. Developers, companies or big investors aren't the average Joe I'm referring to.

Most think it will keep being unstable as big holders and bots are somehow manipulating the exchange so they buy cheap and sell high. This could influence the price to go low, but also a big influx of new investors are expected, so demand could drive the prices up.

That all depends on how much you bought them for, how much you can afford to lose, and how much you plan on holding the investment. If you got in at $50, you could sell and wait for market trends to consolidate, if you are at a loss, you risk losing more if you are a short term trader. Most of all, don't take advice from anyone in this subreddit. Personally, I think it will go down on monday, then go up through the week to at least 150 average, or if the trend is bearish, it will go down on monday and keep going down to $50-60. I think big hoarders and big investors will make the difference, not bot attacks or MtGOX lag.

brain wallet (Electrum) is very secure, at least more secure than a conventional dropbox password or usb drive.

I'm not worried about bitcoin itself, just my 2 satoshis for people thinking on doing it
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:03:23
One day, +tip 1 satoshi will pay for a nice cup of coffee, thanks to people like you

I'd rather see "microcoins" or "uCoins" the same as "microtorrent"/"utorrent" 
1M uC = 1 BTC
