Theres a bunch of speculation going on about 120k BTC moving from multisig adresses today. Is this done by you or is an amount close to this stolen?

You do realize they have already shipped the Saturn and Jupiter miners, in full, with higher performance than initially promised?

Exactly what I was wondering! Something caused a hard fork?

Bitfinex, Btc-e, BTC.sx, kraken.com, the list goes on. Enough possibilities to short!

So you're saying that if you have been violating the Terms&amp;Conditions of OKCoin.cn with false passport/fake information/etc. you are now under scrutiny by them? I am outraged! How dare they enforce their own rules...

The problem btcdrak is talking about, is that everyone that starts on OKCoin just sees **10x** and **20x** yelling into their faces. To find out how to reduce your margin or how to use cross margin mode is relatively difficult. Can't you guys just add 3x and 5x as buttons, and make a setting available where you enable 10x and 20x margin? This would be far better and safer for your less experienced users, and would reduce the amount of margin calls greatly in my opinion.

Could you elaborate on what "remaining btc margin" exactly means? Do positions get liquidated at 90%? 95%? 98%? If at 100%, where do you get this "remaining btc margin" from?

When are you guys going to implement all the algo orders on your API? Currently I can't place anything like trigger orders, trailing orders, whatever via your API, but I can via the site. This is a very annoying discrepancy.

Could you tell us where the servers are located and with what hosting company? Or which hosting companies have the best connection to your hosting? A lot of people are interested in co-locating with your servers to reduce server lag but I for one am not sure where your servers actually are. If you can't disclose the exact location of your servers I would understand, but at least tell us around what area?
