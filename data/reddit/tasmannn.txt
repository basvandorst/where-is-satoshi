Thanks that makes sense. I just thought I could keep things simple, but I guess I have to choose between privacy or convenience, I will give it a try.
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:34:37
Clever, so this investors are buying up the bitcoins we spend quietly. In this fashion, they wont make the price move. Bitcoin is seriously under valued.
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:37:23
This maybe a really stupid question, but why can't anyone accept bitcoin payments directly by putting their address or a QR code on their site?

Definitely part of my rational.

Fuck'em, bunch of low networth bickering sub.

Yes, we met at the bank branch and exchanged in their board room.
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:47:56
Not the first.

This is the most the bad news can push it down, we found the new floor.

Want copy of my DL too?
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:27:00
Convenient excuse no?
Almost sure Luke's tool can see pass that.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:24:34
This tool accounts for non listening nodes, much better picture.

People are not 100% right for ever. He was good at cleaning up the code and managing the project in the early days. But Bitcoin has outgrown a single man's opinion and capabilities. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 01:59:30
Spot on, I think the XT move made the drama worst but I think it's also overblown. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:44:42
You don't own your bitcoin on Coinbase, no one should keep it there. Good quick way to buy coins thou.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:13:02
A price jump because miners will have half of what they have to pay electricity bills.
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:04:10
Is this going to work with other multi-signature options too? 
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:12:38
Thanks for making this open source 100 bits
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:11:18
What kind of video, tutorials?
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:12:11
That's similar to one of my setups, I also like using a Ledger as one of the coinkite keys.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:11:11
When will yahoo just turn off the lights and go away?? It seems like in the current state of press it pays to be "stupid".
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:04:03
I really think in your case you should use something simpler so you don't make mistakes and lose your money. Try something with multisig, either Electrum or Coinkite.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:24:37
@_date: 2015-08-24 21:42:39
When is Trezor Connect going to support transactions?
@_date: 2015-08-30 13:09:52
There are much bigger markets that are not so price sensitive but need better, faster and more reliable payment like paying suppliers and getting things shipped from factories to distributors or to other factories. These are trillions of dollars going trough wire transfers that suffer from all kinds of disputes and delays.
@_date: 2015-08-31 03:38:28
To do that I would use [Armory lockbox]( or [CoinKite offline]( Alternatively, just buy a Ledger wallet for 15 bucks and use that.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:15:10
That's interesting, I think brainwallet was super useful it should had just had a warning for newbies to stay away.
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:47:18
Maybe in his network, but I heard many bitcoin companies talk about 2-4x growth in the last few months.
As user become more educated and they want to use real bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:14:47
That's a ton of coin 
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:43:30
Buy on Coinbase and store it on Coinkite multisig.
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:05:00
Ledger is by far my favorite wallet. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:55:49
Just sweep that private key with [CoinKite]( into a new multisig wallet, then either keep it there or transfer to your preferred wallet. I'm a user of Ledger with multisig myself.
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:21:08
I followed [this]( but it's a bit thin. [This other one]( is better, and you can just with do it with 1 ledger even though they show it with 2. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 19:22:10
I just found this in their FAQ, anyone used it before?
would this work with my Ledger?
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:03:42
That's awesome, will do. But how do you plan on paying bills?
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:45:40
Please implement this now!
@_date: 2015-07-10 19:36:03
Nice, what are the fees (if any) to post jobs? 
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:07:19
I've being happy with Electrum, CoinKite and Mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:22:04
I don't like single points of failure and I have now a few different setups (1 of 1, just to use ledger with coinkite interface and notifications and 2 of 2 for my savings. I plan on trying more options where I have others co-sign my ledger with their key being what ever their want). Also I like the interface and other features coinkite has like sweeping keys.
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:06:23
It think will be much more than that, if we see any rally it will go to 10K than crash down to 1K.
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:10:50
Dude stop telling me what to do. Down vote if you don't like it.

Andrew, when are you going to fix this image? Or you will just lie? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:44:51
Have some patience, this spam situation wont last much longer. Also, I'm sure they are working on updates.

Not that I know of, it will just sit for a long time. You can try to resubmit with a large fee.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:23:44
No, they are pushing for Extension Blocks. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 03:26:03
I also bought a few with no issues. He works for the competitor Trezor.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:19:42
This is awesome! Maybe foreign to some, but when you are doing thousands of transactions, specially via API and need to audit something via visual interface it is incredibly useful. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:14:38
I might be wrong but I think this attacks don't work with HW.1 because they use real security chips. I if you use multi-signature, using a Trezor as one of the keys you would be much safer, even with firmware upgrade.

That's expected they need to pay salaries.

It is quite amazing that we can follow our whole economic system unfolding in public – Bitcoin is awesome.

Nice lineup

Not the owner, I just think its a good breakdown of features. 
Must say I'm not a fan of US hosted wallets.

Stand alone?
Ledger + Coinkite is my multi+signature combo
@_date: 2015-10-21 14:36:37
Open solutions have a higher winning chance in the long run. Remember when people use to laugh at the possibility of Linux being used by big enterprise?
@_date: 2015-10-27 12:27:14
Buy it on Bitstamp or [Coinbase]( then store it on [Coinkite Multisig](
@_date: 2015-03-22 19:38:08
Korea is so "digitized" that if bitcoin starts to catch up there, it will be massive, very fast.
@_date: 2015-10-27 12:28:58
I use Coinkite with Ledger, very secure combo.
