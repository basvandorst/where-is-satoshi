They have earthquakes since thousands of years, but still build this weak houses.

It's useless to run IPFS on that node if it's not actually used.
IPFS won't store any content if it's not directly requested.
And noone should use a third-party ipfs-node without a local one.

The miners will just also switch to the other coin.

Well if you think about the fact that you have saved a piece transaction-data for eternaly (or until bitcoin dies again), the price seems very cheap.

The assumption that the blockchain does not grow is stupid. It grows by 6mb/hour. So if we want to stay at the growth-rate of our device-storage, we are already at the same rate. See your graphic  where the storage growes by 7.134mb/hour. (1000000mb*16years*365days*24hours).

Smart Contracts in a blockchain?
@_date: 2015-11-26 13:39:42
If you consider that 50% of the current coins are 'burnt', than the real inflation of bitcoin is 16% atm.

Is it possible that the asic-chip is also usefull to validate the blockchain? Or is it realy just used to mine bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-19 12:49:16
Yes I know this. What I don't know is, if sha1-hashing is nessesary for the blockchain-validation. If true, than the asic could help here.

What you do seems irresponsible and will destroy your credibility.

Such a shitty registrar wtf is this shit.
Why handling with uncalculateable coins instead of just telling the actual price of the product??
@_date: 2015-10-31 11:20:40
I dont mean the fact that they are using bitcoin. I was refering to the coins-system which you can see here:  It's bullshit
@_date: 2016-07-13 09:37:45
Yes they will be possible.
Of course the transactions will never happen directly on the blockchain but there are other possibilities like probabilistic payments or payment-channels.

Hashes are mostly used to encrypt passwords in databases. So you dont have to worry if your database is hacked, because it is very hard to get the passwords out of the hashes.
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:46:57
Yes, they dont care if its the original text. But mention that is has 32^16 possibilities. So noone will be able to decrypt it without the original text
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:10:34
HAHA, nice one
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:01:24
Only on double sha256 hashes. So the answer is NO.

Ty reddit-people.  Problem found - problem discussed - problem solved.                   
If ipv6 would be designed by reddit, planet venus would have been conterminated by human  !!
