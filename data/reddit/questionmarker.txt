Heh, I had a transaction in the queue for 11 days before Friday. I had a feeling something was up, and what do you know...
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:41:20
Not universally. I got a small amount out 11 days before the shutdown without verification.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:30:32
Heh... I had 2.6 that I tried to extract at almost exactly the same time as you. Not such a happy ending in my case.

"Online transaction processing" is usually abbreviated to OLTP.  Googling it might prove enlightening.  To save you a modicum of effort, it would look like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or MySQL in a pinch.
It just so happens that MongoDB arguably *is* designed as an OLTP store, but...


It's generally regarded as irresponsible not to use an ACID store for this sort of job.  "NoSQL" throws ACID out of the window for various tradeoffs.  For instance, without having transactions across documents, MongoDB cannot guarantee Atomicity, Consistency or Isolation without being *particularly* lucky with your document's schema.  In exchange, you get speed.

All the more annoying, because I took that transaction's success as a sign that a larger one would go through. It didn't, instead vanishing into the aether until the shutdown when it got reversed.
Bah, and also humbug.

I don't know what the floor is going to be, but I don't think this is the start of a crash. Take a look at the [log-plot of mtgox]( on bitcoincharts, the dip really doesn't look out of the ordinary.  Not only that, but the rise has overall followed a fairly clean exponential for the past month (which you can tell because the oscillations on the log-plot fit around a straight line fairly well). According to [this guy]( it's *super*exponential growth that marks a bubble, and that would show up as a rising curve on the log plot, with peaks growing closer and closer together. I just don't see that here.

I think if ins1der's post has any validity, it's that the price of bitcoin could well drop to what it was a few months ago. That's not to say that there's no value in it at all, just that it'll get all the hot air taken out of it.
I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

Well, first on the list has to be making it easier to exchange fiat for bitcoins. That's something that could actually be fixed by MtGox, but they don't seem to want to.

We might well know this to be the case, but establishing evidence such that the USPTO (and all the *other* trademark offices) can accept it is another matter. This *needs* a lawyer to handle it.

It's a human problem, not a technical one, but I think it needs to be addressed early on if it's actually going to provide a usable currency.

I really quite like that Britcoin uses OpenID in its current incarnation. I'll be sorry to see that go.

I've been using Mechanize in Ruby (well, and some other bits and pieces, but that's all you really need). It's dead simple to learn.

Go via L$ on Virwox. There's a commission on each trade, but it should be fairly quick, and there are more ways to fund a Virwox account than an MtGox one.

The conventional way to do this would be to build a buffer into the price based on a 20-day (or whatever) volatility measure, so that you can be sure that you'll only be out of pocket by a predictable amount for a known percentage of the time. However, there are two problems with this: first, bitcoin is so volatile right now that any conventional volatility measure would have to balloon the buffer to a point that made the prices stupid, and second, traditional volatility measures are bunk in general[0], and anyone who understands the maths well enough to use a more modern measure, if you believe they can be trusted, is probably already doing it for a conventional trading house :-)
Unless someone who's actually *doing* it comes along to correct me in my armchair-quarterback role, I'll go on assuming that anyone doing this is making a gamble, which they may or may not understand.  I'm not trying to make a perjorative comment here - this stuff is damned unintuitive at times.
[0] This is where the original "Black Swan" concept comes from.  The statistics of price movements make it impossible to guarantee any part of "predictable amount for a known percentage of the time."

This has nothing to do with patents.

Internationally this is pretty huge - it's been a right pain to buy BTC in the UK for *months*.
