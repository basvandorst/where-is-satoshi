I like that some of those characters look like smiley faces. Makes me happy.

Well they'd do the same with Bitcoin if they accepted it. Bitcoin doesn't cure being a cunt.

I don't get why everyone calls them shady. I've been using them for my main source of Litecoin for a while now (via BTC/LTC, admittedly no fiat money). Never even once had a problem, except maybe a few downtimes. Deposits and Withdrawals are fast and their site is decent in my opinion, except for the trollbox which I personally find entertaining.
Yeah, their updates are in broken English or Russian (?) which usually is a bad sign but other than that they seem quite reliable.

Updating his posts with a video and more details.
Props to him if he's still messing with us. I find this thread hilarious.

Still at 48% for me.

Well it's only depressing if you don't see the obvious hints Mark is dropping like posting 9gag links and blinking morse code.
You are really ignorant if you don't see that!

Don't try to bring reason into this. This is clearly some Illuminati shit!
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:20:00
I think people are actually buying this. This MtGox thing is the Boston Marathon all over again wow.
Edit: Ok, wow, OP is actually serious.
You guys do realize he's being flashed repeatedly by a shit-ton of cameras right?
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:13:22
These comments are a whole lot of *whooosh*.
Edit: Oh god OP is actually serious.
@_date: 2014-11-02 01:08:37
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:28:09
This. Also, people lost huge amounts (and I mean fucking huge) of money here because of some incompetent fucks. Do you really feel the need to rub it in?
Yeah, you could say it's their fault for leaving money on an exchange but still... try to be a little more tactful.
Disclaimer: No, I never had any money on gox.

Things that shouldn't be plotted at logarithmic scales: price charts, lots of other things.
Seriously, this makes it look like $250 is almost the same as $1000.

This is just one slide. Watch the entire meeting. They have a pretty good understanding of what blockchains do and openly acknowledge what they don't know. Overall they see a huge opportunity in blockchain technology.

Donald, is that you?
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:33:13
All those scammers! Good thing I only trust the BTC-e chat. I heard China is pushing BTC to 1100 tonight!

Features like this are definitely something I want to add. Generally the original intent was to add some sort of (optional!) AI features to it.

Haven't been on Linux for a while but this shouldn't be too much of a hassle, for example:
Ubuntu: 
Archlinux: pacman -S python
I guess for other distros it isn't that much more difficult.

Not really to the programmer. The key/secret is only stored on your hard drive in the .ini file, albeit unencrypted.
This data is then sent via HTTPS directly to BTC-e.com. Even if someone was to intercept the request he could do nothing with the data. Well, that's the short version of it.
Theoretically, I could have added code to simply send the key/secret to myself after reading it from the .ini file. Even then I could not withdraw any coins, only trade.
But yeah, would be cool if someone other than me could vouch for this program's security.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:39:06
Why, thank you! Although just by looking at the screenshots that's hard to believe. Bitcoin Trader appears to have a lot more features, some of them even being useful.

Yeah, graphs would be the next thing to add, together with the public trade history. To be honest I don't know how difficult it will be as I've never done something like that. Knowing Python, however, I'm pretty sure there's a module that makes plotting graphs VERY easy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:07:51
Well I haven't looked at that one in particular but I was pretty sure there is already something like this out there. It was a nice programming exercise anyway ;).
