I opened my account, went thru most verifications (minus the credit card option) then sat on the account for about 8 months, do you think that would show them I'm not "high risk"?

I got to use it, totally agree

i did a little research before sending you that message, apparently there are some states that have not granted the license to "transfer money"..... whatever that means.  thanks tho i'll check out Gemini &amp; Kraken :-)
