You said you deleted all your posts on reddit because you don't want anyone to know who you are. Deleting your posts on reddit doesn't mean they're permanently gone. A new account would have been a better move.

I sense a huge peak coming early-mid June ^^^^^2018

All I know is my gut says *maybe*.

Ahh, I only have 2 bitcoins that I bought for $124 each a few months ago. I was tempted to use SR a few times, but lost interest and forgot they were there. 
I've been waiting over a week for my account to get verified, which sucks because this time last week BTC were $450-500. Now prices are close to $900.

Good. I made an account, just need to wait for my address to be verified. I don't mind showing proof of address and ID, but I don't like having to go to the extremes :p
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:14:19
I would have bought 10 minutes ago when the price was $800. It'll go back up to $900 soon enough.

Mo' money, mo' problems.

If you want to use Bitstamp, expect to wait a week to get verified... Been waiting since Monday, also submitted a ticket, nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:11:50
And in the coming weeks when the price goes up to 1000, you'll sit here and say "why oh why didn't I buy them when they were 800!"
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:55:23
Ahh yeah I missed out the most crucial step, fold it! My bank doesn't send me paper statements, I used to shred them as soon as I got them.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:38:30
Oooh gracias
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:09:10
Buy buy buy
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:10:58
That looks delicious.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:36:38
Bah, never enough in my bitstamp account to buy them this cheap! Ahh well, I've invested more than enough in the last 2 weeks.

That's because all the zombies are at home staring at bitcoinity, pausing briefly to moan "craaaaaash"

I've been using Bitstamp for a while, they've been helpful albeit a bit slow. Maybe your bank flagged it cause it's such a large amount or something? I remember hearing about banks raising a red flag once anything over $10K starts shuffling around.
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:18:24
Yeah they're worthless, you should give me your coins.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:31:33
Just another reason you should never click links or open attachments from emails you aren't expecting. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:47:36
Boring, I can just go to gonewild.

Send me 0.09995 BTC and I'll tell you the stuff OP is keeping to himself. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:53:08
I wish my Bitstamp account had been active when prices dropped to 495 :(
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:39:14
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:08:16
Or maybe we need a pyramid for marketplaces.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:08:37
I think the world is ending.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:34:31
Took me a week. But that was when they were having issues with something else. 
Make sure you submit ze papers exactly as they specify. Otherwise you could end up waiting 3-4 days to find out you've been rejected.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:49:39
I printed off the PDF and scanned it. Worked just fine :p
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:47:20


There's your problem.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:44:38
Quick verification? I don't wanna have to take a picture of myself holding my ID, bank statement [while hopping on 1 leg...](
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:53:25
Shhh. World is ending, sell now.
^I'll ^just ^be ^over ^here ^buying ^them ^all ^at ^low ^prices.
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:42:44
It was a good thing I didn't use it though. As the coins I bought are now worth 7x what I paid :p
