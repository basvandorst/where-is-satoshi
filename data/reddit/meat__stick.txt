“A shipping container in a remote corner of a Canadian oil field is churning out an unlikely byproduct: bitcoin.
Inside the container, high-powered computers generating new units of the cryptocurrency run with hardly any human supervision; they just need power—lots of it.
In what seems a perfect marriage of supply and demand, that power is coming from natural gas with nowhere to go.
Power Couple
Natural gas has become nearly free in parts of NorthAmerica, making it appealing for the mining of bitcoin,which also has lost value.

Natural-gas prices have cratered over the past few years. The market is awash in the stuff, to the point where some North American producers are setting it on fire or paying people to take it away. In some parts of Texas, natural gas is now going for less than nothing for the first time on record. More companies are now looking at productive ways to use the natural gas right at the source.
The container sits next to an oil well owned by Black Pearl Resources Inc., near the town of Marwayne, Alberta (population around 600). Black Pearl is getting a good price for its crude these days. But for all the oil the site pumps, it also pulls natural gas out of the ground, which presents a problem.
Hauling it away to sell it isn’t economically viable for a location this remote, and it can’t just dump it either. Local governments in places like Alberta have limits on how much natural gas companies can burn or release in the air—“flare” or “vent” in oil field lingo. When that level is reached, producers may be forced to shut down oil wells to avoid a buildup of natural gas.
That has turned at least one traditional oilman into a bitcoin entrepreneur. Stephen Barbour, a consultant who helps lower costs for oil field companies, last year set up the 20-foot-wide container to mine bitcoin, with a power plant attached to convert natural gas into electricity.

“I knew about all the wasted energy that goes on,” says Mr. Barbour, who until a few years ago worked as a mechanical engineer for an oil company. “Reading about bitcoin mining and how it could monetize energy through the internet, I just thought that was unbelievable,” he said.
Ryan Wartman, a production foreman for Black Pearl Resources, said that channeling about 400 cubic meters of natural gas a day to the bitcoin-mining rigs in Mr. Barbour’s container helps keep the wells operating 24 hours a day.
“It was the best option for us,” said Mr. Wartman. “We’re using it to bring ourselves below the government-regulated amount that we can vent on location and keep producing oil.”
Because bitcoin mining -- a process of solving complex equations to “make” new units of the virtual currency and earn transaction fees -- is so electricity-intensive, much of it is done in remote, chilly areas with cheap power, such as windswept parts of northwestern China. When bitcoin prices exploded in 2017, mining in North America also took off.
As the digital currency’s value has plunged over the past year, inexpensive electricity has become even more crucial for miners.

Lightspeed Hosting, which runs data centers for bitcoin mining and other uses, is building a new facility in Akron, Ohio. Chief Executive Joshua Holmes said one way to cut down on electricity costs could be to build a generator and take in cheap natural gas from Appalachia, another region with more natural gas than producers know what to do with.
This year, Lightspeed has also started submerging some mining machines in mineral oil to cool them, another way to keep energy costs down.
It’s hard to keep costs any lower than in Mr. Barbour’s shipping container. “I know for a fact that I have the lowest operating cost on the planet,” he said. “But the other side of that is the capital cost.”
Natural gas that would otherwise be disposed of powers the bitcoin-mining operation.

Buying and outfitting one shipping container to handle the high power consumption can run anywhere from $45,000 to $130,000 even before installing the bitcoin-mining equipment.
For others, such an investment just hasn’t been worth it.
Dave Perrill, which powers bitcoin mining in data centers in South Dakota and Texas, said he has had to pass up offers to team up with natural-gas producers and landowners in the Permian Basin because of the infrastructure costs involved. “It wasn’t economical for us to make it work,” he said.
The digital currency has traded near $4,000 recently, down from a high of more than $19,000 in late 2017. Mr. Perrill said bitcoin prices would have to exceed $5,000 at the current level of mining difficulty for him to consider taking on excess natural gas from the Permian. (The computing power required to create each new bitcoin has increased over the years as more miners compete to create coins–and the number of coins are finite.)
Others set the break-even benchmark much higher. Last year, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jean Ann Salisbury estimated that using free natural gas would only become profitable if bitcoin prices averaged $18,788 over the next 15 years, based on initial costs of about $700,000 for the power plant, $100,000 a year in operating costs and increasing mining difficulty as time goes on.
For now, Mr. Barbour is holding on to the cryptocurrency that he creates in Alberta, only selling bitcoin when he needs to cover operating costs.
In addition to his container on Black Pearl’s oil field, he has built and sold two other units. He is working on his fourth for a team in Texas that was drilling for oil but found only natural gas.
But he has struggled to get oil-industry veterans interested in mining cryptocurrencies. In September, he showcased a rough version of his mining container at an oil show in Lloydminster, a city on the Alberta and Saskatchewan border, to a bewildered crowd.
“Locally, pretty much nobody knows what bitcoin is,” he said.”
