Happened to me once as well. There is nothing we can do but wait. If everything is "legit" the transfer will happen/be cancelled eventually.

I think I am missing the point... is this a game/puzzle?

Me me! Thanks for your generosity. Happy Tuesday.

Wow! 100BTC sounds like a huge investment! I am aiming to acquire about 2-3 BTC at most, but will also spend some along the way. 
All the best!
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:29:50
Hooray! Thanks for the tips!

Perhaps you can consider donating some to charity?
@_date: 2017-02-18 15:43:47
Oh yes... I have forgotten about that...

They should include a small reward (in bitcoin) for completing their survey...
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:47:16
I am incline to agree with you...
By the way, how do you know "90% of the economy already stated their position"? Where did you get the number from? Any reference?

Lots of problem with the withdrawal... I deposited 10mBTC and at the end left with 4mBTC+. Withdrawal was denied. Scam!
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:21:19
By the way, how much is their 2%?

Interesting to know that at the time when the video was taken, the price for BTC was almost at the lowest point ~$230...

Just a few supports who clicked "buy" when they were drunk... the price coming back down... Exchanges in China did not response much.

Yes... oh yes.... Done. You mean this rally will be shortlived?

Hmmm... the price of ETH has not been moving for quite sometime... 
Maybe this BTC/BCH war can do some help...
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:03
A correction is needed for the price to go even higher. In the event of a dip, weak hands will be out first, leaving behind the hodlers... Hodler will buy more and build a strong foundation for an even higher rise in price.
This cycle will keep repeating until bitcoin finds its "true value" (5% gold, 10% gold etc?), which no one knows what it will be.

It will be great if he dump all his coin all at once. Many people are waiting for the cheap coin. After he dump all his coins, he will be left in the history of bitcoin...

You are not enjoying your fortune at all! 
If I were you, when it reaches $10,000 (total value of $3.65M), I will cash out 100BTC = $1M to enjoy the money =&gt; left with 265BTC.
Then when it reaches $20,000 (total value of $5.3M), I will cash out 50BTC =$1M to enjoy the money =&gt; left with 215BTC.
Then when it reaches $30,000 (total value of $6.45M), I will again cash out 33BTC ~ $1 M to enjoy the money =&gt; left with 182BTC...
and so on... There should be a balance between the increase in your fortune and how you enjoy your fortune. Maybe by the time 1BTC = $1M, you will no longer able to enjoy the fortune... what a waste!

Is this the start of a "bank run"?
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:47:43
I do hope that this is not bubble... but looking at the price increase I have a familiar feeling of a pump and dump... 
I hope I am wrong- I am actually checking the price almost every ten minutes!
