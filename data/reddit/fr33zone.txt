Yeak, ok, I'll bite. I want bitcoin to fail. And I'll tell you why. It has probably done tremendous damage to efforts getting crypto currency into the mainstream. Pretty much all of the press around bitcoin has been about silkroad, mtgox, hackers siphoning off bitcoins from the unsuspecting. And so on. And so on. The exchanges that grew as bitcoin emerged were more like wild west bars in some dusty town, run by people more interested in $$$ than BTC, at the expense of those willing to trust their snake oil.
I want a good solid crypto currency to succeed. I want joe-normal's trust. I want a platform that is easier to use than a wind up vibrator but more secure than a nun's knickers. 
Crypto currencies started as a viable alternative to $$$ and offered the world, the whole world, an honest an open alternative to big government slight of hand. But the speculators rushed in on their money mules hoping to get rich quick. So the message of bitcoin has sullied early aspirations. 
The idea of trust, an irreversible transaction, simplifying escrow services were meant to lower costs. Uncertainty and distrust drive up costs. Bitcoin works, and it works well. But we now have uncertainty and distrust as externalities. Bitcoin could have worked but reputation is a hard thing to shift and these externalities will inevitably effect transaction costs. 
Two solutions - to get joe-normal on board now we'd need "well regulated" institutions in place providing an illusion of security. Or we take the original idea and start from the bottom up by designing an infrastructure that is scalable, secure and transparent.
