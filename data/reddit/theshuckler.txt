Which is effectively what I just said.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:34:32
Well there's really nothing else to say. I can't argue with someone who disagrees with the fundamentals of what I'm trying to say.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:22:17
I'll never stop supporting "cops". If certain policemen are assholes, I'll happily get rid of them as authority figures.
No matter how many cops shoot innocent people, we can always fire them and get new ones.

Obama's a socialist in the same way taxation is theft.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:43:43
Well yeah. I can respectfully disagree with someone if they make reasonable arguments, and there's even an official test to prove what makes someone "intelligent".
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:28:01
Well that certainly seems to be the gist of how laws are formed, yeah.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:48:06
There's nothing really to add.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:32:19


If you think the average person is capable of making an intelligent and moral choice with their money, I have a bridge to sell you.


They know a hell of a lot better than most people do.


"America, one of the most free market developed countries in the world, has people abusing their power, therefore all states are filled entirely with corrupt aristocrats and making a freer market will have fewer people abusing their power."
Makes sense.


Well yeah, if you ignore that they're overworked and underprivileged and the person in charge doesn't care about them. Sounds like free market capitalism to me.


If it were that simple, people would have done it years ago. Unfortunately letting everyone decide for themselves would probably be the worst thing someone could do for the world. Freedom isn't the end-all be-all destination for everything. Hell, freedom isn't an inherently desirable trait.


But you're saying that someone thought that a war, AKA the biggest waste of money in history, would be a good way to make money. And that it isn't ok for people to take money for you if the country profits off of that money.




Projection doesn't solve your problems.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:01:59
I'm beginning to think hypotheticals aren't the best way to argue my point.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:22:17


I could believe that.


Well not really but also yeah. Roads aint cheap, you're not gonna get a private company to build them without any incentive. If you pay them for road building, they effectively have a monopoly until someone else decides to put in the significant investment in roads.


I find it funny how you go on this whole rant about how I'm such a terrible person right after a "you should try not to unfairly mischaracterize people" statement.


If you don't feel pain, why shouldn't you touch a hot stove?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:46:09
Those aren't the "fundamentals" I'm talking about. Thanks for assuming the basic concept behind government will cause literally everyone involved to become corrupt though. I needed more conspiracy theorists on my case.
The fundamental question I was posing was a philosophical one. While you live your life in search of liberty, nothing comes without a cost. If you had to choose between freedom and prosperity, which would you choose? Freedom is a nonexistent philosophical concept that has no real value. Would you rather have a good computer or a choice between a good computer and a crappy computer?
In the end there is really one "best" choice for every situation and as much as people like to believe that "free will" is a desirable pursuit, it's merely the ability to choose the bad option.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:37:32


What's the pay?
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:13:21


You haven't even started.


Yeah ok. You have fun with that.

Move to a less financially conservative country. The taxes pay for better services.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:24:08
Nothing, just backup for a potential argument. Please, continue.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:36:37


That's what politics is.


Because they're absolutely shit at it.


Because they're allowed to.


And yet that's still not enough to put the U.S. on par with any other developed country. At least none I've heard of.


The "economic freedom index" is completely irrelevant. You'd be lucky to find a government with less intervention on people's daily lives.


Yeah, of course, it's all a bunch of investors. I'll just ignore all the costs and politics that go into everything.


Very human, thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:33:43
Yes. The reason "harming people" is usually wrong is not because of the intrinsic value of harming people being wrong, it's because causing harm to people usually lowers happiness.
If you use any other moral system, moral rights and obligations are variables that may cause a lot of harm to people even though they're "morally right". Any non-utilitarian could come up with some bullshit explanation for why you aren't allowed to make people happy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:14:03


Compare that to other countries though.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:28:18


This is a purposely extreme hypothetical.


The purpose of this is that the way they limit rights allows society to function better. Like no drugs allowed so less people get addicted and stuff. The Libertarian/AnCap philosophy is that people should have all the freedom they can, but if you had to choose between freedom and quality of life, which would you choose?
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:03:58


But why do you care? Why do you have such a desire for these "inalienable" rights? Would it not be easier to let the "government-run monopolies" take over?


We could spend hours debating the various ins and outs of the political system that would lead to a conclusion. It's highly based on personal preference and ideals.
If you want my personal opinion, yeah, it's perfectly right. Freedom has no intrinsic value but many of the things that can only be obtained through these "violations" do have value.
EDIT: For those of you here from "Shit Statists Say", I would legitimately like an answer for why you care about your rights.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:43:55
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:45:00
"against their will".
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:00:59
Then I still can't argue with someone who disagrees with the fundamentals of what I'm trying to say.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:50:27


Yeah but if I wanted to I could.


Yes I did.


Subjectivity is a thing that exists in certain aspects of life. In other aspects, it's not a thing.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:38:32
I'm saying politics, and by proxy politicians, is the way a people collect to decide what they think is the most morally right and how to go about doing it. Because there are competing ideologies and opinions there's no simple answer in what it is or is not moral to do in terms of a country.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:51:08
Well, it's better than paying a toll to use roads, or whatever would fund privately owned roads.
Oh look, these people increased prices on the roads, I guess I'd better find a separate company with tonnes of money to build extensive pavement networks that also happened to build in a conveniently close area. That shouldn't be too hard.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:57:00


No thanks. I'll stick with my cushier life with more entertainment accommodations and such.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:08:14


It's oversimplification. If you use metaphors that by nature ignore one side of the argument, it is the definition of oversimplification.


Yes. You would have to be blind to not see that. People can't be trusted with control because they always mess it up. 
Give someone LSD and tell him it'll mess up his brain and it's potentially addictive. Sit someone in front of a slot machine and tell them that they're statistically likely to lose money. Put someone in charge of a company with big profit margins and good employee services.
Come back in a day and you'll find them high, bankrupt, and corrupt.
Of course you need to force good ideas onto people.


Oh so what you're saying is that the war that you had your money forcefully taken from you for is actually for the purpose of making money, therefore effectively paying you back? You're saying the entire purpose of the war was not actually just "kill brown people because lol"? It's almost like you agree with me!




Ad Hominem and non-sequitor. Noted.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:50:55
I don't know which world you're living in, but here on Earth, the best education systems in the world are publicly funded, and governments often use their tax systems to fight big corporations.
The fact that America has a shitty government is probably the best argument for statism there is. America is pretty conservative compared to every other developed country.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:52:11
And I'm ok with that.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:08:29
Wait, so you're an AnCap that's actually reasonable and has intelligent opinions? I was hoping you'd exist, but I was starting to question it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:37:02


It assumes that we won't let complete idiots run the place.


The third option is a hell of a lot worse than if I let you choose who was in charge. Because then all infrastructure would crumble and it'd be a free-for-all scramble to the top.


Because if Anarchy doesn't work out perfectly, although it boggles the mind why anyone would think it would, then we're gonna have a society entirely reliant on profits shitting all over each other. If you were to sacrifice all the safety and community just so you wouldn't feel like you "had" to pay for these government ideals that benefit everybody, would you think it was worth it?


Wouldn't you rather we avoid bad decisions at all though?
In case you haven't picked up on it yet, people make bad decisions all the time.
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:15:30
Ad Hominems won't make you any less wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:48:51
I think you need to take your own advice.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:36:05


Then he shouldn't have continued the argument.
I ask him a simple question to determine his allignment and now I'm supposed to provide an example for my purposely extreme hypothetical? How about I don't?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:13:37
Like, there's lower crime rates, higher technological progress, healthier food, better service, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:16:04
But what's the purpose of "raising the prices"? Who benefits from this? In a standard monopoly it's putting unnecessary power in the hands of the CEO or whatever, but if there is no CEO then...it's just making higher wages for the workers?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:33:44
Yes because everyone who isn't an AnCap is such because they simply didn't bother to "first understand" the philosophy. The only reason anyone doesn't live in constant fear of a collective government is because they simply haven't thought about it first.
I posed the question to determine the breaking point of his desire for freedom, but now I see there isn't one and there's no point to discussing it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:28:58
Yeah because the war can be simplified to people stealing money because they want to kill brown people. It has nothing to do with the fact that many Americans supported it due to a complex political climate.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:12:53
Yeah but I can't imagine what reason someone would have for thinking something differently. It just seems immoral.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:57:50


That's why the government's there to encourage people to make good decisions. Without the government, there is no negative encouragement for "selfish behaviour".
Oh sure, they can pay welfare to people without jobs or whatever, but pretty much everyone isn't satisfied at the bottom of the barrel, and will try to get jobs that actually pay.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:16:53


Look it up.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:48:42
I think the main problem is that you live in a country with a bad government.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:57:24
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:05:27
Assiming, hypothetically, you were a "cattle" being ruled over by a totalitarian government, but the totalitarian government was still morally structured and provided the best potential benefits it could to its people, would that still be a problem? Would you still be upset about your rights being taken away if you were better off without them?
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:48:29
I plead the fifth.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:37:42
I'm stating the facts here. Claiming that a requirement to support projects that benefit everyone is theft is about as correct as saying a moderate in one of the most conservative countries in the world is a socialist.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:42:27
Brilliant comeback. Now I completely understand your point of view. I should have just thought of it that way before. Continuing to use Cherry Picking to make increasingly complex metaphors has worked so well I now see the error of my ways.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:12:27


@_date: 2013-04-09 14:57:16


I already answered this in the other discussion we had.
The real mind boggling question is how to determine the value of happiness, which is nearly impossible to do effectively.
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:48:17
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:05:19
I did not deny property rights, I simply denied that taxation is taking property against someone's will.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:18:04
Periwinkles 4 lyfe.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:18:57
Taxation is theft in the same way Obama is a socialist.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:28:44
Yeah the part where you assumed everyone should logically be an AnCap.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:23:58
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:24:06
Well if you want to believe in a philosophy that *by nature* lets you do things that harm people, then be my guest. I just won't succumb to moral bankruptcy.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:42:24
For the sake of my argument about the world after your anarchy plans take hold, yes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:21:49
Well the purpose is that there is no "fear" of the government. They do everything to benefit you.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:16:43
The question is why do you want these "natural born rights" if the government is trying to make things simple by creating these "monopolies"? Why do you care that you can't start a plumbing company when you can become a publicly funded plumber?
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:27:18


I have serious doubts about that. As exciting as 60 seconds of drama is, it's easy to come by. I can contribute more by staying alive and keeping my job that makes peoples lives easier on a daily basis.
I'm not going to argue the rest of your post because it's more AnCap sensationalism about not even trying to understand my point by oversimplifying the issue. It's a running trend and I'm not going to humour you by allowing it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:18:53
Alright we'll just make it so there's no law enforcement at all and people aren't given "the power of life and death". I'm sure that'll do well for keeping all the criminals in check.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:30:59
Well let's say "criminals" as in the people who kill and steal from people who don't do that so we don't get into an annoying semantics argument.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:16:40
I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying lots of people thought it was.

@_date: 2013-04-08 21:54:11


Any action that causes more harm than good is wrong. Allowing those actions is morally bankrupt. We must take what we can get for these situations.


Yeah, which is due to the government letting big corporations go unregulated.


Hahahahahahahaha. "America is a nanny state".
Might as well say that North Korea disproves Anarcho Capitalism as well.


This is the opposite of the truth.


So who got this war to work anyway?


If New York is Communist then I'm officially the uncle of a flying pig monkey.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:40:45
Oooh, "monopolies", scary terminology from the kings of scary terminology. 
Of course, we all know why monopolies are bad right? Because the person who holds the monopoly can raise prices beyond what is necessary for a profit. And any publicly owned company doesn't take prices from the people.
Soo...why do you care about it being a monopoly again?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:04:26
I do to! Imagine if all the cops just broke down and started killing people. That would be a shame for society. I'm glad that's an incredible unlikelihood.
Oh wait you were being sarcastic.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:45:52
If by "talking out of my ass" you mean "pointing out that simplifying an issue to support whatever talking point you believe in is fucking stupid", then no. I will not stop talking out of my ass.
Look at the way you argue. It's odd that every AnCap I've tried to have a discussion with has attempted to oversimplify a situation with slightly relevant metaphors in a poor attempt at pathos. There's the whole "robbed at gunpoint by the people who regulate everything and keep everything controlled", "I personally don't agree with an action that the government took so they are horrible people", and let's not forget "point out that they're foreigners so we make it seem like the government is racist".
Isn't it great feeling so self-confident that you can strawman any argument that comes at you because the *evil* state is trying to ruin everything? You never have to admit that the purpose of the war wasn't "to kill brown people on the other side of the world". You just have to be confident in the conspiracy that everyone in the government and military are sociopaths that like to kill things and steal money to get it. Brilliant job.
