A non-technical user should not be running a node. A node's operator should be able to detect, diagnose, and repair problems as they come up -- which is not something non-technical users would do. Worst case scenario is a malfunctioning node actually harms the network.

Running a full node is a task for a server. The vast majority of the servers in the world are headless (no GUI, command line only). Most people run full nodes on servers, in datacenters, with gigabit connects and five nines of uptime.
While your contribution of running a node on a laptop in your room on a residential connection is much appreciated, please understand that this is not the way a node is typically implemented.

PayPal can then send him an invoice for that money. Not DW it out of his bank account. PayPay's wall-of-text contract doesn't mean shit; if he's not happy, he can reverse the DW. 
If you get double-charged at a gas station, you can reverse the CC charges. Then it's the gas station's responsibility to prove that you actually bought $x of items. Same thing here: he reverses the DW, and PayPal has to prove he actually owes them money. This stops the whole PayPal being judge+jury thing. "Somebody three transactions up make some fraudulent charges" is not a good enough reason.

Yet pirate has insisted he keeps most of his funds in fiat? 


Assume for a second you have some (non-ponzi) business method that got you 7%/week. Would you share? 


If most of his funds are in fiat, wouldn't he only have to do that for payouts and the occasional withdrawal? 
Just to clarify: I'm not defending pirate here, it's most likely a ponzi. Just playing devil's advocate. I don't give that much of a fuck, I put in 1k (fiat) near the beginning, and when it doubled, I withdrew my principal. So right now, all I have with him is his own interest building on itself. I withdraw a bit here and there to keep myself happy, but in the long run, I won't be too hurt if all this goes to shit (which it probably will).

cavirtex: Enjoy your 3% fee per transaction (plus 6$ or whatever every time you withdraw). 
canadianbitcoins: Usually a 1$ spread, which isn't too terrible, but still not something I'd want to deal with on a regular basis. 
localbitcoins: I've bought and sold on here, but it's not really reliable and you need to drive, etc. 
I've been mostly using cavirtex (they withdraw/deposit to my bank account), and they're okay, but I'm still looking for a better alternative.

It's a method of "laundering", if you want to call it that. The faucet distributes coins to all bitcoin users. If you originally stole the coins you have, and you're worried that the owner/whoever might try to follow the trail, you can drop a portion into the faucet (making a large number of bitcoin users have "tainted" coins). Same goes for randomly giving them away on IRC.

Simple: 10% return / month (that's what I calculated a while ago, anyway).
If you want more security, get a "safe portfolio" (diversify your investments over as many securities as possible, so if one dies, your net loss will be minimized). 
Also, read up on [the securities section on bitcointalk]( Nearly every security on GLBSE has its own thread, search it up to see how people feel about it before investing in a new one.

I would recommend the bill payment option. No need to provide proof of ID or anything to cavirtex. 
First, go to the deposit page. There you'll see something like "your cavirtex account number". In your online banking (pretty much any bank), add a new payee, ACITELECOM. Your account number is the one you got from cavirtex. 
Back to the cavirtex site. On the deposit page, enter the amount you want to deposit, and select "bill pay". Then go to your online banking, and send the same amount to aci. 
I can confirm this works with Coast Capital Savings. Had a small hiccup the first time I did it (apparently cavirtex wasn't set up to accept bill pays from credit unions), but I got a prompt reply after emailing them, and it's been fixed that bill pays don't take any more than 48 hours. 
Also, go read the FAQ. I could have made mistakes here. 
@_date: 2012-01-10 01:12:53
Which is why:
1. Deposit funds into cavirtex
2. Buy BTC
3. Transfer to MtGox (withdraw from cavirtex to the wallet mtgox gives you)
4. Sell at higher rate
5. Withdraw from MtGox to your US bank account
6. Wire transfer to your Canadian bank account
7. Repeat from step 1 *ad nauseum*
8. Profit!!!

A couple solutions: 
If you and the merchant are on the same service (say, blockchain.info wallet), confirmation is instant. 
Also, as bitcoin becomes more popular, we can expect more miners, leading to blocks being mined faster, leading to faster confirmations on standard transactions.

New info as of today, up to you whether you believe it or not: 
    &lt; I'd just like to say, I never expected all this madness when I shutdown BS&amp;T.  
    It's been a lot more work than I could have even thought and I simply messed up. In hindsight,
    I shouldn't have stopped things so suddenly. Although it was nice to finally get some sleep, 
    things have been spiraling out of control this week and pushing my personal deadlines.
    &lt; At this point and in an attempt to stop the bleeding (interest) I'm going to be 
    forced to payout everyone at once, which I'm sure will piss off enough people to counter the
    lack of payouts but I don't see any other way of handling this.
    &lt; My concern is not "winning" the bet as much as it is "donating" the winnings.  
    With the events of this week causing delays, 5K worth of coins is a piece of sand compared to 
    the amount of money I'm losing every hour.
    &lt; I'm doing everything in my power within the contracts of the "Real World" to get 
    things moving as fast as possible.  If, I end up losing the bets and spending everything I worked 
    for to make things right I will.  I will not be giving any additional times or dates until I know 
    exactly when things will happen.
    &lt; I know you guys want updates and communication, but I'm somewhat muted by 
    the personal attacks and legalities of whats going on. There is a lot more to this story than 
    just "Send me back my coins."  If I had all the coins just sitting around I would've has this 
    wrapped up a long time ago.

You tell me. Assume you found some legitimate business method/loophole/whatever that netted 10%/week, but you needed massive capital, and you had more than enough (hence deposit caps) already coming in. Would you share your methods, or just pay out investors 7% and keep 3?

I wonder what the actual chargeback rate is for normal businesses. I've heard all sorts of numbers between 1 and 5%.

You can get average fee paid over the last day by messing with the blockchain api.
Using the total fees and # of transactions from [here]( (specifically [here]( you can get output with php like this:

@_date: 2013-08-11 14:16:00
1) Between $50 and $250, average was around $100. 
2) They were all via either Reddit or localbitcoins. In all cases, these weren't brand new accounts... 3-12 month old accounts with 1k+ karma that were fairly active/had some lbtc reputation. I even talked to one guy on the phone (briefly) the day before. Accounts were deleted right after the chargeback was made. I didn't attempt any sort of identity verification or otherwise past that (because if people were okay with that sort of thing, they'd just sign up with Virtex, no?). 
3) Payments were accepted using both [Interac e-Transfer]( (to a personal account) and [Interac Online]( (via a gateway business). Customers were informed what the charge would look like on their statements, so I doubt there was any confusion. 1/2 e-transfers were reversed, and 2/3 online payments were reversed. 
Side note: Oddly enough, I also accepted many member-to-member bank transfers (ING Direct transfer, Coast Capital transfer, and RBC transfer), and I didn't have a single problem out of 20+ transactions. This might be because banks consider member-to-member transfers "personal", so there's never any reason to chargeback... while CCs/debit are for "business", so chargebacks are an option. 
4) Between a week and two weeks, although I'm not sure what the delay is between completing a transaction and getting a settlement/statement post (because of the gateway company I mentioned earlier). 
I suppose you might be fine if you stick to small amounts... The only market advantage you have right now is that it's (pretty much) instant. Just make sure you have a healthy budget for absorbing these kinds of problems. If it was easy, all the exchanges would be accepting credit cards right now -- don't assume Interac is any different.

There are currently [11,537,700]( bitcoins out there, with [429,622]( moving in the last 24 hrs. That gives us **3.7%** utilization.
There are currently [$1,200,000,000,000 USD]( in circulation, with ~[$34,433]( spent per capita per year. $34,443 * [316,500,000]( / 365 gives us an estimated $29,866,327,397 USD spent over the last 24 hours. That gives us **2.4%** utilization. 
Bitcoin is utilized more than the US dollar. There are more people "just sitting on" their USD than there are people hoarding Bitcoin. 
Side note: This is odd, because Bitcoin is a deflatory currency by design (fixed amount = deflatory, sorry) while the USD is an inflatory currency (Congress prints more money when they run out = $ is worth less), so these two figures should be the other way around.

Debit actually costs more for smaller transactions... If you don't have any company-specific agreements*, the fee schedule is similar to: 
Visa/MC - 3%  
Interac (Debit) - $0.50 + 1%  
Amex - 4.5% 
*sometimes you can get an agreement with a company -- lower fees for certain branding, etc. "Use our AMEX bill holders and we'll charge you 2.5%", "I see you're not accepting CCs yet, we have a special introductory rate of 1% for six months...", "If you agree to only accept Visa and no other CCs, we'll only take 0.5%", etc.

As someone who's had 3/5 interac-for-bitcoin trades reversed, I'd recommend you think again. 
In Canada, debit (via interac) is chargeback-able the exact same way as credit cards are. Depending on your bank, it might even be the exact same form. 
Right now, I can reverse any debit transaction I've made over the last 30 days by calling the number on my debit card, and saying "I don't remember making this transaction, I don't know who this business is". 
Good luck though. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:14:42
While with bitcoin, the recommended fee is 0.0005 BTC = $0.37, right? But remember, the sender pays the fees. So, as a customer, I can pay $3.00 on debit, or $3.37 on Bitcoin. If the business is using a merchant solution for BTC, they're paying another couple points on top of that -- BitPay charges the business either $30/month or 1%, if I remember correctly.

Canada here, seems like there are some differences: 
1) Credit cards are extremely popular here, because of rebates. 1% is common for scrub cards, sometimes 3% in the form of travel points. My Amex gives me 6% on gas/groceries/restaurants, 3% everywhere else, double warranty on everything I buy, VIP for concerts/shows/sporty things, free rental insurance, and a few other benefits I don't really use. 
2) Most cards don't have a yearly fee. I pay $150/year for mine, but most normal Visa/MC cards are free. 
3) Retailers are prohibited from charging fees for using a certain form of payment (they probably just raise everyone's prices by that 3% or whatever). 
4) Credit cards are the safest method of payment. Cash? Might lose your wallet, pickpocket, counterfeit problems, etc. Debit? Most banks don't reimburse you if the thief managed to see your PIN. Credit cards, however, I can report stolen anytime, and dispute any charge. Merchant overcharged me? Chargeback. The product stopped working and the merchant is refusing to refund me? Chargeback. It actually gives you power as a customer, because the CC companies almost always side with the customer. 
In short: credit cards are amazing *because* they're based around borrowing money. If anything goes wrong with or shortly after a transaction, it's not my money I spent -- it's the credit card company's. CC companies will bend over backwards to make customers happy. And if you pay off your balance every month, you get all those benefits for free (if you have a no yearly fee CC).
