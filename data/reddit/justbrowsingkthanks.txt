To answer why someone would unload US Treasuries you have to know WHO is unloading them.  Is it private Chinese exporters (who are flush with treasuries because what else are they going to do with the dollars we send them for their junk)?  Is it government owned exporters?  Is it military owned exporters (remember in china there are two powers sometimes at odds, it's not so stable as people think, there's the military and there's the communist party.  they are sometimes so at odds that cities have unofficial territories, like gangs have in the ghetto.  you have your military hotels and your party hotels.  your military business district and your party business district, etc).  Or is it Chinese banks, wealthy individuals, their Central Bank?  
It's nebulous.

I wonder if most btc transactions are outside their database.  Anything in an online wallet I would think they have.  No?

inflation means an increase in the amount of currency.  price inflation is when prices increase.  because the media just say inflation when they mean either one of the above it's difficult to tell what people mean when they are talking economics.  I think you mean price inflation, but the reason we didn't see that in QE is that banks had to increase their reserves, and foreign central banks have been winning the devaluation race, as much debasement as the US has done, the rest of the world has done more.

yep.  but its strange times.  the dollar getting stronger during a bull equities market, and now getting stronger as you would expect as equities turn over.  but underneath it all is china threatening war, essentially, by saying they will dump treasuries, buy american real estate and firms, and start trading oil in something other than dollars (which the us navy has been tacitly requiring for 50 years).

Its not simply a btc slump, its been an absurd bullish $ which has no sign of stopping.  btc and gold look a lot better in euro terms or yen terms over the last year or two.

there's a good deal of talk about it on zerohedge from time to time.  it's sorta the 800 pound gorilla when it comes to US currency.  If oil is being traded in something other than US Dollars there is a great risk of the massive amount of dollars abroad coming back on shore (which means the buying up of US assets - stock, real estate, exports - as if we have much to export anymore).  When those dollars come back we would not have this strong dollar, we would have a quick move to some serious inflation.
Now, take that with a grain of salt, because foreign nations still have 2 great incentives to trade commodities, particularly oil in US Dollars.  1.  The Dollar is still the world reserve currency and besides gold perhaps has the highest credibility as a store of value.  2.  The US Navy.
In conspiratorial circles there have been predictions for years that China and Russia would dump their holdings of dollars and we would have massive hyper inflation.  All of those predictions have been false but this last week China made a direct threat I haven't seen before now so it's on my mind again.
But remember, so long as the US Navy is protecting the sea lanes from pirates, which is to say so long as the US Navy is the dominant Navy in the world (this is why defense spending is so large, our leaders know that to maintain hegemony we must have the biggest stick, particularly over the water) it's unlikely things will change.  If ships carrying oil were being being unloaded for something other than dollars the US Navy would either let pirates raid those ships or more likely would become the pirates, instigating conflict which would result in a gulf of tonkin type event and the 'murican people would be calling for war.
Catherine Austin Fitts was the first person I remember hearing talk about this.  She was a board member at Dillon Read I think and had a top position at HUD under Bush 41.  She's at solari.com

And when the bitcoins increase or decrease in value do you get the change in your account?  
ie - do you have a bitcoin account or do you have a fiat account where bitcoins are converted on deposit?
@_date: 2015-09-04 23:41:58
yes.  just give instructions to your trustee before you kick the bear in the balls and after he eats your face (or however you plan to die) your trustee can handle your accounts, including btc.

I dont think its doomed.  free trade may lift the the aggregate economy, but it destroys certain segments that cant relocate, and now that the average middle class american is leveraged beyond belief and still cant afford to buy the shit they want people like Trump have a real chance.  might or might not happen in '16, but protectionism is back baby, and the sooner the reptiles at bilderberg get cozy with that idea the better chance the west has at holding off the commies in beijing and moscow.

@_date: 2015-09-03 06:19:18
No matter how many examples there are in the real world, people never learn and this 'debate' keeps happening.  
"we need democracy to prevent elite special interests from controlling this important thing."
and then elite special interests get their way.  
"we need more democracy plus additional regulations, and a group to enforce them."
and then that group enforces what the special interest wanted plus new things they want.  
"we need more democracy and more people need to vote.  its the fault of non-voters."
and rinse and repeat over and over.  
the point?  democracy doesnt prevent elite special interests from exploiting things.  in fact it serves only to legitimize, protect, and encourage them.

It actually makes sense (not this Puerto Rican across the board intervention into the lives of hut dwellers, but neo mercantilism as a broader movement).  With the war of attrition of currency devaluation in a mad dash to export to the US coming to a close as Americans increasingly cant even afford the disposible plastic chinamart shit they throw at us this big phony global community kum ba ya is breaking into pieces.  So countries are about to dump the dollar, tell the us navy to go drown themselves, and start trading oil in some new IMF invented fiat.  But before that big middle finger gets thrust up at the washington monument they want to be flush in hard assets, like gold.
