Bcash donations? Nice touch: [No BCash](
Great work. Will be a great resource to keep an eye on LN. 
Just curious - how easy it to use Grafana?

No, just set your order and let GDAX do it's job. You can check up on whether your orders are filled periodically by logging in on desktop or mobile.

If you want to purchase BTC at a price below the current price then you would just make a limit order. 
i.e. if the price is $16k and you want to buy at $15k, you would put in a limit order at $15k which would get filled if the price drops that low.
A stop-limit order is best used when you already own an asset. A "Stop" will execute a sell when the asset falls to a given price. A "stop-limit" says, "When the price drops below X try to sell above Y". i.e. If I do a stop at $15k with a limit at $14.5k then if the price fell from $16 to $15 the trade would try to sell my BTC above $14.5k. 
A stop-limit effectively allows you to sell when the price drops but avoids selling at fire-sale prices (e.g. if prices tanked from $16k to $13k in a few mins

Method A: Revolut.
*  Sign up for a regular account with GBP and EUR (not with Crytpocurrency support as runny-yolk suggests as this requires you to pay or refer)
*  Link EUR account to Coinbase (
*  Convert GBP on Coinbase to EUR by buying BTC with GBP then selling in EUR. If you do this with GDAX there are no fees.
*  Send EUR to new Revolut EUR account
Method 2: LocalBitcoins.com. They're basically a local marketplace where you can trade with other individuals:
* Buy BTC with GBP
* Send BTC to LocalBitcoins.com wallet
* Find seller on LocalBitcoins and use UK bank transfer payment option. 
Method 2 is a bit riskier and depends on the BTC transaction time

BCH sellers can avoid paying fees with the GDAX trick.
* Transfer BCH from Coinbase to GDAX
* Transfer BCH from GDAX to exchange of choice (e.g. Bittrex or Binance)
* Sell on exchange of choice
This will leave you with USD or USDT on the other exchange. You can then buy alts to HODL or buy ETH/LTC and send back to your GDAX account to cash out into USD.
Alternatively, wait unti GDAX trading is up and running.

Has anyone actually been able to sell above $8,000? Now seems like as good a time as ever to sell any BCH...
