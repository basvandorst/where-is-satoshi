Own both and haven't had issues with either one.

My thinking is this obviously is new so maybe it's not fully developed yet. They've got a Facebook with some trade results posted. Work in progress still?
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:37:37
don't waste your time. It's literally not worth the time or the capital.

As long as in the API setting Withdrawal is disabled you're safe. CopyMe.io for example does exactly this for you. It trades on your account Via API and your funds cannot be taken from that account.

bcash doesn't even have Segwit, they need that first.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:26:46
I'm going to disagree with what you're saying based on the fact that those copying platforms have an incentive for you to do well. They will earn more money by having successful trades and profits creating new membership rather than pumping some useless coin which would probably get dumped. Even if a trade copy did that it's highly likely those people would sell on the way up the pump on their own to take profits. That's the beauty of the thing. People can still make their own trades. If something like what you stated does happen then clearly the people paying for that service we not paying attention or the people offering that service had nefarious intentions to begin with.
I pay for CopyMe.io and have already made $500 off of a $1000 investment. I can vouch that the one I use is safe. I'm sure there are scams out there though in ICO phase.
EDIT: You're also not considering that most trade copiers the expert must first execute the trade for the rest of the accounts to follow. Which means they would buy first. There's no option on Bittrex to buy at market price so the orders would have to be filled by sellers making a pump impossible.

@_date: 2017-11-26 05:44:10
A1: It's safe on their exchange, as long as they don't get hacked, or your account isn't hacked by a third party. Ideally the next step is to either transfer it to a paperwallet or hardwallet where it's safe. If you go with a paperwallet method route be sure to be offline when generating it to make sure it's not compromised.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:10:23
Yea, they're starting to realize that people are finding out that paper money is worthless!

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:40:54
No. in the next 10-20 years when these things are actually a threat to Bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Most coins will probably fork to a new PoW to make these much less of a threat.

It'll got lower. BCH is more profitable to mine at the moment. BTC difficulty adjustment it coming up. Most miners will try to manipulate the market and try to hurt BTC before the adjustment.

If people take the time to learn about Bitcoin they will see the benefits and realize you can buy any amount up to .00000001. If they don't take the time they probably shouldn't invest anyways since they would probably just lose their BTC or the private keys.

@_date: 2017-11-17 21:18:13
More profitable to mine BCH right now. Will see a hashrate change again. Eventually hashrate will come back top BTC for the transaction value alone.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:30:43
All good, not all people understand how this works. I don't support either to be honest. I'm staying away from BCH and BTC because both are in a battle and I want no part of this. Especially with this Tether non-sense.

I don't know much about mining since I've never done it, only ever read about it. From what i hear mining on a GPU won't net you much of an income and just cost you money. From what I've seen the mining equipment has gotten so good that GPUs don't even come close to being able to compete.

You don't make anything for running a node. Just helps to support the network by confirming transactions.

Well perhaps I'm wrong. I posted of what I've read previously. It doesn't help that the team behind Bitcoin Gold has posted little to nothing about it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:35:35
I would recommend a hardware or paper wallet if anything. It's not a good idea to store your info on the computer in the event your computer is compromised then you lose everything.

If you actually read the article it says you shouldn't re-buy immediately. It suggests waiting a while. So no OP, you cannot "You can sell low and buy back immediately to claim a huge capital loss."
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:51:48
Most people don't I feel bad for those buying in early hoping to get the free gold coins. They'll still get the 2X coins but just shows how much of a scam these forks are. Shady stuff going on behind closed doors.

You can buy Bitcoin in any amount. Even less than 1.0, Bitcoin can be broken down into .00000001 as that being the current smallest amount. the $6000/BTC means $6000 for 1 Bitcoin or 1.00000000.

Gold fork has already happened. Split happened sometime around middle-end of Sept. They just didn't advertise it. The gold fork happened early because the Gold team intended to mine the next 16,000 blocks them selves and sell of the BTG as an ICO at a rate of 10 BTG/1BTC. The 2X fork is @ block number 494784.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:17:48
Not ganna happen. Way too much in the mempool
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:33:22
Just make sure you find out the actual block number the fork happens at. If you don't hold coins at the time of the actual block number you don't get the extra coins. Deadline for Bitcoin Gold has already come and gone.

He will send MIOTA and in the default wallet it shows as IOTA. Many people fall for this. So in reality he sends you less than a penny hoping you send him ~$2000 in return.

@_date: 2017-10-01 16:38:44
Only downside I can think of is if there's no replay protection. BCH had this. Lets say S2X happens which does not have replay protection. Now you have 3 BTC and 3 BTC2X coins as well. Well without replay protection you're in trouble of losing both coins if you sell one. Lets say you sell the 3 BTC2X coins you have now. An attacker can replay the BTC2X coin transaction on the BTC chain as well and poof. Now your more valuable coins are also gone.

The "expert" in this video seems a little out of his mind. Quoting him here, he says the IRS is going to send computer generated emails about collecting those taxes and each one will have a $10,000 fine attached. Then he goes on to say you're guilty until proven innocent. That's not really how the law works... It's actually the opposite, You're innocent until proven guilty. I'm not saying everything this guy spouts is complete garbage but he's definitely exaggerating.
