 pg 59 is a blatant miss representation of certain service providers. There's no way in Hell this will pass under it's current design.

Great stuff. Nice to see btc community helping. The poor people in the effected regions. This quake caused a ton of damage and they need all the help they can get:

lol. coindesk is what is wrong here. 
stop using this for your price reference the index is garbage
@_date: 2016-03-27 03:03:04
because of their index methodology.
Use Bitcoin Liquid Index instead:

Assessment Centre?  Sounds like something from a distopian sci-fi movie. Like 1984 or Equilibrium

Damn... really gracing Digital Currencies with the respect and professionalism which WSJ &amp; Bloomberg gives traditional assets and stocks. Well done BNC.

not really. read the summary in the report. It clearly encourages the government to start experimenting instead of waiting to cook up regulation which is refreshing to see.

So if i was a mexican drug cartell, you're saying bitcoin is a bad money laundering service and I should just continue using USD with HSBC?

Sweet design. I like how you a selecting better written stories/sources.

I think the survey is design to get a glimpse of how much people know. So answering 'I don't know' is useful if results are published correctly.

You can't just dismiss all of China trading as 100% fake. Their smallest exchanges are bigger then stamp. Take out all the orders that don't have counterparts in the order book but get auto executed (obvious fake) and CNY trading is still much bigger then USD trading.

This is pretty much a copy and paste of today's other, more in depth article covering Swiss environment. The one with the funny 'ledger technology' title.  Down voted for for lazy journalism

Bitcoincharts does not offer indexing. This new API is great for 'the price' instead of 'the price from 1 exchange at a time'.

Not a point on aesthetics. Point on claiming original link is coindesk source. Whatever - google isn't stupid. ie - it won't show up through google news the way it's setup.
