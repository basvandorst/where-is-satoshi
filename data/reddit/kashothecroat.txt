Thank you for your opinion. What I wanted to say is that I am not worried because I invested only a part of funds that are not absolutely necesarry for my life. I have no time/knowledge to be a day trader or even to wait or follow the market regulary enough in order to catch spikes/dumps like this one. Therefore I invested a certain though not small amount of money and think of it  long-term - years to be specific. I dont own only BTC, but a shitload of other coins. I am a banking professional (distressed assets) from a small European country.

Which exchanges do you guys use for BTC and for altcoins / do you have coins in multiple exchanges?
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:08:29
Looool this bitcoin. I am now just calmly watching it, almost emotionless. I have literally forgotten about my "investment" in crypto. Will not sell no matter what, unless it reaches my goal. If it doesnt, I will keep it forever in my wallets.

It's too painful
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:36:26

@_date: 2018-02-05 21:02:29

Who pumps &amp; dumps then? I watch 6H candles and dumping started like 6H ago, whereas on Jan 7 we had a big green dildo. This should be a coordinated action then by how many traders?

Yes, but this is also 9,000 bitcoin bought ;-)

If this is not market manipulation, then I dont know what is.
