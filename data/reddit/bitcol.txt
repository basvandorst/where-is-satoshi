If you were wondering. found where this was taken. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:58:04
Exactly. I'm in the same boat.
@_date: 2014-10-08 23:35:58
So do you use localbitcoins or something? 
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:08:24
for shame
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:28:46
i think it does. The result may still be the same, but the perception of fault still matters. 
If they had told him that the bank would no longer support these transactions, i think he would have not felt so wronged by coinbase.
They seem to not be handling these things very well. People take their finances very personally, as they should, but are being treated with Bots.
Everyone hates getting bot replies.

Can you explain what you mean? im curious.
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:57:28
you could have wrote " this whole thing is distastefully presumptuous" instead of your over the top rant.
It makes it seem like maybe you are close to Sean's outpost.
Not sure if you know but the last time Ben had suspicions and asked the tough questions he exposed the fraudster running Moolah.

Wow. Thank you. That was an amazing answer. I will need to find this Willy Report.
I appreciate you taking the time to explain this. I actually lost BTC to Gox

Hi, 
Welcome, i suggest going to the sidebar at right and go through the "getting started" and "Faq" sections. 
Do some googling and read as much as you can. There are a lot of great videos and even some free online courses now. below
 
Have fun

 Any ideas on why Virtex has a lack of liquidity?
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:46:05
TowerofOne pops up on everything related to sean's outpost and cries and defends Jason. I have him tagged in the barf green colour as "Total Moron".  It helps to find him quickly. 
I wouldnt be surprised if its jason little brother or something. His sentences are so angry and defensive.

Did it look like this last year? Because its not very user friendly and kinda migraine inducing....
I thought it would look more like a normal professional site...
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:14:40
if my banks twitter account said something about the use of an url that wasnt mentioned anywhere on the actual site i wouldnt use it.
That actually sounds like the best place to attack if you want a large specific group to do something...

I agree this was a terrible article. The author took some huge liberties. He spoke as though iphone was the only platform used.
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:02:07
I dont like this because it implies that he tricked them. He showed them the truth. He did not disguise anything.

This totally disregards the clear value of having a global currency.
If i am dealing in Argentinian inflation, why would i change money sent to me into my local currency?
Also, if my local government all of a sudden wants to freeze my assets they will. Not if the dont have my private keys.
This guy misses the largest benefits. The fact that he didnt mention these items and that the interviewer didnt bring them up shows that we still have some time to wait for adoption/understanding.
i got time.
 
@_date: 2014-10-17 06:24:18
I want to think that people can change. But i also feel that this is a case of "it is easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission". This guy came out of the gates treating people poorly. Investors no less! not strangers. not people he owed nothing to. He treated people he owed $20,000 plus* like shit. 
This is one of those scenarios where true colours (Canadian writer, shut up/sorry) showed through. 
Forgive this guy if you get 20+ testimonials from past customers saying things have improved drastically. Do not let him off for a 2 minute drunken email
Dont do the internet thing where a few small words discount months and months of terrible actions.

@_date: 2014-11-19 19:25:34
Thanks for the tip! I am glad to see that you are out here listening.
I think people do need some advanced notice. If i may make a suggestion... Once you have companies locked in, add them to the page. Even just their name/logo. It is more advertising for them and people will know the types of things they can get - "oh a computer store, Oh a sock company!". We dont need to know the deals, we just need to plan on the types of things that will be available. 
The "event" will be the revealing of the specific items and deals.
I think that would be a 3 x win (buyer seller and for your site). Just my opinion.
thanks again for the tip, 
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:12:13
Haha yes it should be more centralized to protect us...

Commoner here, thank you all for the hard work and sarcasm. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:37:34
This is the exact scenario that happened to me. Although I did not get an error code. Simply "failed" ~~and~~ on the second transaction. 
The first transaction went through perfectly. This makes me wonder if the issue is on the CC side or on the Circle side.

@_date: 2014-11-25 02:55:48
Maybe, but if this makes other news outlets or even on tv, then the intended goal is achieved. I think most people see it as a legitimate way to get Bitcoin in the spotlight for some of its positive traits rather than the usual "illicit use" headlines.
Also Western Union is a predatory company that exploits the poorest demographic... So its not the worst thing going on 
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:54:26
have you tried to buy with your card yet? I didnt have to wait, i just put the info in and bought right away. No verification needed
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:30:23
I believe the problems that circle has had regarding failed transactions has been on the bank/CC issuer side (i have encountered this personally).
Not circle themselves cancelling the transactions. 
Much different.
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:36:33
Are you suggesting that we change the term bitcoin to mean one satoshi?
i think its too late. Millions of people already know and use the term bitcoin.
Also, if a bitcoin was suddenly .003 cents (or whatever number), the media would have a field day. even though nothing had actually changed, they dont do much research.

i have brought this up before. apparently they dont want anyone to plan to buy things. 
I already bought a few things i thought i would buy there, but couldnt take the chance of waiting all the way until the 28th and the items not be there.
I think they are doing a really poor job at this.

Yeah, if you use an ATM from a bank that is not your bank it usually charges you around 3 bucks in Canada. Its a flat rate, so if you take out $20 or $500 it charges you $3.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:25:32
You dont think that this could be a good discussion starter for why a Global currency would be less volatile than small local fiat currency. As it would have the support of many economies and not be susceptible to local or geographical conditions?
I disagree,

I agree. I specifically mention "small local fiat currency" above.
And locality is certainly a factor in volatility. --- See Cuba
 I posted this because i still often hear the volatility argument. This is just showing that volatility happens with all currency. 
This "dead" horse still walks around my office saying "i see bitcoin has crashed again".
I thought this was a good rebuttal.

Credit lending can be done with anything. You could start a bitcoin loan service tomorrow, depending on your country's laws. Credit cards are just small loans with high interest. It could work just like a credit card. A legal contract is still a legal contract.

If you want a cheaper Trezor, you could have gotten 3 for 2 on blackfriday...
Much like new TV's, the price will come down with time. 
Go complain about how much a 4K tv is...
Research and development has to be paid for. Engineers dont work for free
If you want the BEST right now, go grab a Trezor.

I just bought a sailboat last summer with my buddy. we used the money we made from our very small bitcoin investment to buy it. i like the pic you did of the marina or harbour with the sailboats.

Please bottle and send.

@_date: 2015-04-21 16:12:53
Please give mine to the Barbados food drive!
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:27:43
Read this and see if this was the case.
similar scenario maybe?
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:40:20
i thought you died?
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:56:59
hmm, well let us know what happened when you sort it out. So we can prevent it from spreading

I got mine shipped, im in Canada. It took a while, im going to say about a month. It comes from the Czech republic i believe.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:34:17
Haha, i did sleep a little easier. I had about 50/50 online and on Trezor. Now i am 10/90. Just keeping spending money on those wallets now.
I have seen you around here a lot. Keep up the good work!

I had an amazing time in barbados a few years ago.

Its all fun and games until you steal someones money who is willing to hunt you down. It really doesnt seem worth it to look over your shoulder the rest of your life.

@_date: 2015-03-18 20:07:50
Have you tried using Circle? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:04:16
Its the fastest way, that i know of, to get BTC online. Canadian Visa works

Tuesdays are becoming a great day. We have Tie tuesday at work now for fun, even the girls wear ties or some variation, like little bowtie earings.
anyway, happy tuesday!

If you request a middleman, then you will have to pay for the middleman. 
This is how banking started and got out of hand. 
If a company screws up your order, and refuses to make you whole, write a review and call the better business bureau. Make large purchases from trusted retailers or in person. 
I get the need, i just worry about ending back up where we are now. With the middlemen making trillions out of thin air.
Maybe this can be done with a decentralized escrow program based on the Blockchain

Rome was not built in a day. It is still very new. It has also had a big impact on the winners. 5k is a lot of money to a lot of people.
Hopefully one day it will be million. heres to hoping

If i put it on my laptop and hang out in coffee shops does that qualify? or i can put it on my bike?

RemindMe! 2 years - of this massive ignorance, and to send him this video
@_date: 2015-03-23 21:36:30
It would be good for all of us. Im in that sub often and its is a huge catalyst for introducing people into bitcoin. 
So much conversation about "how to send $1 the quickest and easiest way" - Bitcoin comes up a lot and a lot of new people get into changetip from there. 
Its a good idea to get this sub on board
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:18:52
worked like a charm. I love bitcoin so much. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:23:58
With enough money and determination im sure anyone can be found. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:58:10
Wanted to buy one, almost bought one, then shipping
[I think i'll pass](
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:46:58
Congrats. Thats awesome. 
A word of warning though. Announcing this makes you a potential target. Would you walk into a dark alley and say "i've got $3300 bucks in my pocket"?
Read this article of how someone got hacked for their BTC.
Please be careful and i hope you get to 21BTC, But maybe just give yourself a quiet pat on the back. 
To the moon!

Changetip use over on millionaire makers is awesome. I love seeing it kick paypals ass in every single way (Cost, ease of use, transaction time). I love seeing people new to Bitcoin there say "Wow that was so easy and fast". 
Once people use bitcoin they realize the power
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:07:26
I totally agree. My friend and I just set one up two days ago.
Its costing us like 20 bucks a month on linode, we spend that on coffee, so we figured we'd chip in.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:18:06
it's a trap
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:00:38
im sure you could find a helpful android savvy person to help ya
@_date: 2015-02-26 05:32:24

@_date: 2015-03-31 03:44:13
This is amazing. well put.

Millionaire makers for this month started today
Ryan Kennedy was arrested
Today is a good day
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:42:31
i love the "what you wrote must have been good" haha.
Thanks for the tip. I will use it in other subs.
@_date: 2015-02-27 07:01:34
ah. thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-02-01 06:56:35
This is awesome. I hope to see him speak about bitcoin.

I'm not sure of the timezone on that but i think it shot up an hour and a half before this. 
I could very well be wrong
