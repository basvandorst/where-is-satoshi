It means that the network is that much harder to subvert.  Security in strength - if it becomes effectively impossible to control the network, it means that it is a secure platform to develop on.  The current efforts to develop technologies based upon the protocol are akin to the web 2.0 push that took internet usage from something that nerd-focused to a mainstream thing that everyone and their grandmother uses.

It can run off of a CPU.  Just as you can use a rubber band to secure the vault in a bank, and leave the doors open, you could run the entire bitcoin network on just a single CPU.

This is worked around quite easily.  The fact that bitcoin are effectively pegged to national currencies means that there's no need for worry about the (eventually) deflationary aspect of the currency.  If it were the official currency of a country, or recognized (officially) as an international reserve currency where national currencies pegged to it, then yeah, it could have potential issues.
Bitcoin's perfect scenario is where it becomes a predominant means of value store and one of the main means of facilitating international exchange and transferring money (in lieu of Western Union for example).
As far as the 21 million number... that means that there are currently up to 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis possible.  If each Satoshi were worth one US penny, that would mean $21 trillion could easily be managed by the system.  More if they decided to add more decimal places.
The thing to get your head wrapped around is not the number, but the fact that it's the protocol, not the ultimate supply of bitcoins.  It can scale effectively infinitely.  Even if people do horde what they have, it won't restrict the flow of trade, as liquidity issues aren't on the bitcoin side, they're on the fiat side, and bitcoin effectively flows around them based on how the market dictates.

If someone with a vested interest in a decentralized payment platform (ahem, ebay, western union, etc.) were to decide that they have had enough of a potential threat, dumping a few hundred million USD on designing and churning out a bunch of ASICs may not be the best investment now, but if they only had to spend, say, $10M USD?  Why not?
Personally, if I were in a position of power in either of those companies, I'd be advocating that exact strategy right now.  Corrupt the competition.

If you refuse to take preventative measures, such as vaccinating, you should be barred from public spaces.  Who cares if you get sick, but *I* care if you make me sick because you're breathing near me, or accidentally bump into me as we are at some store.  Get your food and supplies delivered.  School your children at home.  Work remotely.  Just stay away from me, and let me be free to live and all that without the threat of serious illness / disease.
You're free, but I am not?  If my infant (who is too young to get immunized) gets [this nosnsense]( from you and dies, it is nearly impossible to prove that, but you're still free to run around in public spreading your disease.  I'm fine, because I'm immunized, but my 3 month old baby is dead.  I love freedom!
Also, enjoy raising your retarded (not figurative, but cerebral palsy) children after your wife / partner / girlfriend / baby mama gets [this](  Now, I'm going to go out on a limb and ask why we, as society, will be responsible for housing and assisting this person after they reach adulthood.  YOU made the choice to skip your vaccinations because "MUH FREEEEDOM!", but now the rest of us are shackled with the responsibility for your decisions.

Ballpark numbers... 300 units in batches one and two, and 600 in batch three from Avalon, 75k chips at 7.5 GH/s (assuming no dead chips at all for the sake of this straw man) from bfl and ~200 th from asicminer.  
So, totals:
Avalon: 1200 units @ 60 GH/s = 72 th/s
BFL: 75,000 chips @ 7.5 GH/s = 562.5 th/s
As I mimer: 200 th/s
Total: 834.5 th/s
Of course there are Avalon orders with more hash power, and there will be bad chips in BFL's run... and who knows where asicminer will stop building out.  Arrive at difficulty from whatever ballpark hash rate you wish.

On a somewhat related note - as long as it remains as "difficult" as it is to keep your BTC safe, it will effectively deter broad-based usage.  
The average Joe/Jane sees that it's not that hard to keep people out of your house, and it's not that hard to keep your money safe in a bank... why is it so hard to keep your bitcoins safe?  It must not be worth the hassle, and it certainly isn't worth the risk to keep more than trivial sums of money tied up in them if they're so "easy" to lose.
@_date: 2013-02-13 06:33:28

Sorry, but your math is a bit off.  Take that $5k, and with your example, that gets you 4 rigs - so a total of 6.4 GH/s.  Network hash rate was around 20 TH/s one year ago today.  So, the math for one month worth of mining works out as follows (assuming no statistical outliers, etc.):
6.4 / 20000 * 144 * 50 * 30 = 69.12 BTC mined in October 2012 alone.  Now, if you had held onto that, it is worth around $9k right now.  Two years ago, you could have gotten to ballpark hash rates with different gear (load up on 5850s for example), and the math works out like this:
6.4 / 8600 * 144 * 50 * 30 = 160.74 BTC mined in October 2011.  You could have bought just under 1200 BTC for $5K back in October 2011 - but I will say with great confidence that if you could have eaten the electrical bills, you would have more BTC today if you just mined.
Of course, people need money to pay the bills for electricity, etc, but still - I think that my point remains valid.  $5k worth of mining gear two years ago, holding the earnings, would have been an incredibly impressive investment.

I was there for the chat as well... they aren't going to half populate them, they're going to underclock the fully populated boards for the SC singles.  So, if you were an early pre-order, you have basically two full units ready to go if you want to plug in a bigger power supply and hope you don't burn the boards out too fast.
If I were in that position, I'd do it in a heartbeat.  Running 2x for the first couple of weeks would easily pay for replacement unit(s).
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:41:11
Because the cost of "breaking" BTC is the only real thing that you can tie to it right now.  It's not as if there's the killer app that everyone has been clamoring for, and there hasn't been widespread adoption by a big entity that will drive massive transactional volume.
Look at it like this: if the current "cap" is $5B USD, and it would cost you a bit over $1B USD to launch a 51% attack and effectively destroy BTC - is it really "worth" $5B USD right now?  Certainly, an oversimplification, but that should illustrate where I'm coming from.

If you think that the total network compute is going to increase more than 30 fold in the next year to 750 TH/s, then yes, you are correct.  Otherwise, at a 30x increase, the BFL products pencil out to a roughly 6 month ROI.

Be up front with them and tell them that it's what you're doing.  If they shy away?  Fuck em, they were going to do this to you.

If they drop by 1/3 each month, then they earn 32 in June, 21.3 in July, 14.22 in August, and 9.48 in September... for a total of 77 BTC - 4 month ROI with hopefully a little left over for electricity costs.
@_date: 2013-02-11 21:28:43
Doing the math, assuming a doubling of the compute power by the time the first full batch of BFL ASICs go live (and Avalon of course), you still should be in decent shape at that point.  Once the mass production flood gates are opened, it's a different story if you are increasing your hash rate to keep pace.
Edit to add: if I could slip $30k past the wife, I would jump at the mini-rig without hesitation.  Waiting 6 months however, is a different story.

The same people who live in houses that have running water, provided to them by public utilities that were funded with tax dollars?  Typing on the computer that had its technological foundation built with tax dollars, chatting on internet message boards using telecommunication gear and cables run with publicly subsidized tax dollars?  Or, you know, the tax dollars that helped develop the internet, without which we wouldn't even be talking about crypto-anything, let alone not paying taxes on it.
Enjoy your ride to work on that road paves with tax dollars, and the cops patrolling for drunk drivers on your way home from that movie you just watched at the theater.  You seem to disagree with the notion that you are a willing participant in the relationship, but you are in fact free to move to countries with lesser, or no taxation.  The real question is, why haven't you done so yet?  Put your money where your mouth is, and back up some of your political dogma with action, rather than your libertarian wing nut rantings on taxation.

 I just spent 3 months in Sydney.  We paid A$1450 per week for a 3 bedroom apartment with a view over Elizabeth Bay.  I'm not so sure I'd call it "expensive", as there were TOOOOOOOOONS of listings that were far more expensive.  We're back in San Francisco, and everything seems inexpensive.
You know what IS expensive?  A$4 for a freaking can of coke at a corner store in Sydney.  It's like $1.50 tops here in SF.  Screw the differences in rent prices.

Bitcoin absolutely has a physical component to it - the single most powerful network of computers in the world.  There IS tangible value associated with that, whether you want to acknowledge it or not.

To add to what pyabo said - if you were to order right now, you'd likely get your mini-rig at the end of May.  The amount of ASIC miners that will have been connected at that point is anyone's guess... but it's not at all unreasonable to assume that the total compute power on the network will have increased anywhere from 3x to 10x.  
My opinon - I think that it's still worth it to do it right now.  I would do it if I could sneak the $30k drop in the checking account past the wife.  However, I'm not going to risk the marriage over it, haha, so I went with two of the single SCs.  Supposedly will get my order in April (ugh).

Basically, I'd be paying about $7.72 a month for their cooling and internet connectivity.  The added benefit of faster warranty replacement if it is needed and what should be a faster connection to the interwebs (basically no shipping time) - those 2-5 days could pay for the first year of hosting if difficulty hasn't shot past 250,000 Mhash/s (at $30ish / btc)

Sure, I get the whole difficulty thing, but by and large, if your compute power stays relative to that of everyone else, what difference does it make if the difficulty is 1 or 1 billion?  It'll ratchet back down if it's too high and ramp up quickly if it's too low - so the pool of bitcoins being earned every day will be roughly the same, and assuming no really weird outlier type luck, distributed roughly the same.

Very cool to have you respond.  I understand that they continue to decrease as more hash power is added to the network, but for something to realize (effectively) complete ROI in under a month rings the "sounds too good to be true!" alarms bells, you know?
Even going forward from July, a single BFL (if they ship, hah) or Avalon 60 GH/s unit look to be earning 16.53 btc for the month if the hashrate jumps up to 450 TH/s by the end of the month - enough to cover the cost of the BFL unit, and about 1/3 of the Avalon unit.  Seems like an incredibly solid deal either way... Avalon unit would pay for itself in 4-6 months, less if BFL still can't get their act together... and the BFL pretty much within a month.

It isn't a problem because btc pegs to local fiat currencies.  This circumvents traditional problems associated with deflation, and will remain necessary going forward.

Fair enough, I understand that things can hit critical mass and just like the literal explosion, there's the figurative explosion of acceptance / uptake.  The problem is that currently, if you took every single bitcoin ever created, and gave them all to the occupants of a single country, it could handle a single year's worth of GDP for the following countries:
Marshall Islands
Yup, that's it.  Also, even though there would be cap to cover a single year of GDP, it certainly wouldn't be enough to cover the net worth of the countries as well.  If you want to talk a billion, or even 100 billion, the problem still becomes the presumption that there's enough liquidity for the people in a country to buy in wholesale in relatively short periods of time without it wreaking havoc.
Look at it like this: slow rolling adoption, then it hits a tipping point where everyone effectively "needs" to adopt.  So, they rush to convert their currencies.  Soon enough you're going to hit a self induced hyper inflationary period, and those that weren't early adopters are utterly ruined financially.  FUBAR situation, for sure for large portions of a country.
It's a pretty scenario for the early adopters (and those folks that have held on to their BTC long term)... but the logistics of switching an entire country's economy over to BTC are just stunningly difficult.  Additionally, what government is going to be able to collect revenues to pay for vital services (are you going to transfer BTC to the local fire station to get them to dispatch a fire truck?) with an anonymous currency that doesn't leave a paper trail that can be audited?
@_date: 2013-02-13 05:03:21

Mini rig from Butterfly Labs us $29,899 and supposed to weigh in at 1.5 TH/s - so marginally faster.
If thus is Avalon equipment, which right now are the only ASICs on the market, someone bought 24 or 25 of them at $1200-$1500 a pop.  So, about $30k, give or take.  
Bear in mind that these were ordered quite some time ago, and you cannot just order one and have it humming in your office/den/garage next week.  May or June is your best bet at this point.

We are talking about the same thing.  Right now there's roughly 25 TH/s of total compute on the network, the first wave of BFL products as well as Avalon once they ramp production, will make a huge impact on that.  If they increase it to 400 TH/s, it's still proportionally not a bad thing for the first wave of ASIC owners.  
60,000 / 400,000,000 = .00015 * 146 (blocks) * 25 (block reward) = ~0.5475 bitcoins/day
So at today's exchange rate of $24.50 or so, that works out to $402.41 in revenue.  A bit more than 3 months to see ROI in that scenario - which seems astoundingly good to me.  Also worth considering is the fact that the network capacity won't just instantly ramp up to those numbers, meaning you'll have more than $1,200 in bitcoins after those first three months.
@_date: 2013-05-12 04:51:14

Between batches 2 and 3, all of the Avalon chip home brews, and the units BFL does manage to ship, it should at least double, likely triple the current hash rate.  Then throw in any wildcards such as new manufacturers (kncminer for example), and top all of that off with a proportional increase from our friends at asicminer, and you're looking at a fairly conservative estimate of 5x increase.
@_date: 2013-05-12 04:41:49
Even at 10x difficulty, this will break even in roughly 5 weeks, depending in how much power it consumes.  Since they're building it with 28nm technology, it seems like a safe assumption for a viable product (as in, not scamware) would be closer to the 1 watt / GH that BFL was hoping for with their products.

I think that right now bitcoins are very much over valued.  My opinion is that the BTC "market cap" should be equivalent to the cost of a 51% attack.
Hopefully soon the "killer app" arrives - some functionality getting built in, large company like ebay or amazon starting to use it, or small country taking it as their primary currency.  Until then we are in a gold rush bubble as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2013-02-07 04:40:19
But why bother to deal with it if its value relative to various other currencies fluctuates wildly?  It just means that they have to exchange it right away which complicates their finances and makes it more expensive (exchange fees).

Suppose BFL or Avalon were inclined to try to brute force their way to 51%.  Make it so difficulty ramped up to the point where GPU miners just bailed, further increasing their lead - and all along Avalon (or vice versa) wasn't able to ship enough to stop them.  What happens to confidence in bitcoin as a viable currency then?  Now, as soon as they've cashed out, they can conclude their "test", and ship their product.  They've been paid for the ASIC boxes, and they've mined a shit ton of bitcoins.
Now, I'm not saying that this is a smart move, or a logical one given the business they're in, but what if?
Relative to the sudden price drop - if MtGox is able to put in stop loss functionality, how many people do you think will take advantage of it to "protect" their investments?  Would there be enough people ready to get in very fast to be able to stop such a nose dive?  I doubt it, but the damage is done on a short term basis.  The amount of press surrounding such a massive nose dive would only help reinforce mainstream notions that bitcoin is a "fad" or "not real/serious currency" and discourage big companies from taking it as a form of payment, etc.
Personally, i'd love to see $5 bitcoin prices.  I knew of them at the time, but paid the whole thing no attention to it as I was busy remodeling a house (wife and I did the finish work other than finishing the hardwood floors and hanging the drywall), running a business, and dealing with a pregnant wife.  Two of three are OK, three of three is a PITA.

They have to re-do their boards... sure they have some coming in early next week, but then they have to:
1) test... 
2) validate...  
2a) iterate as necessary (BFL fanboys pray for just one)
3) order them in quantity
4) wait for shipping
5) receive them and get them ready
6) populate them
7) test the production boards
8) package them for shipping
9) yup, then they can ship
Seriously, this is NOT happening in a week to two weeks.  A month at the very minimum sounds like a herculean effort... two months sounds like a BFL effort.  Don't get me wrong, I am on the hook, and I want my order... but I know better at this point.

Taxation would have to revolve entirely around consumption taxes and taxes on real property.
Maybe a VAT would work? Hard to say.  Tracking product from manufacture to sale isn't that difficult on a small scale.  Taxes on real property are pretty well sorted out and not rocket science to establish and collect.
So there would be ways if doing it, it would just take some infrastructure to make it happen.  The real question isn't "could it happen?", rather "what's in it for them?".  You're going to gave to make a stunningly persuasive argument for people to even consider it.

His commentary was directed at "the base", which didn't really hear anything but their own notions being reinforced.  Somewhat technical folk might have been curious to know more, and non technies were turned off.

You would be better served to compare it to PayPal's market cap.  Since eBay owns them, you have to do some guesstimating.  They get credit for about half of the revenue, and even though it is safe to assume that they contribute more proportionally margin-wise, let's give them 50% of eBay's market cap, which is currently around $70B.  So, that's $35B.  1/10th of $35B is $3.5B, so roughly 3.5x current price of $90ish is $315/btc.
Edit to add: eBay expects to handle $300B in transactions this year (see for details).  At today's volume extrapolated out a year (see  for that), we are looking at a bit over $57B in transactions handled by bitcoin on an annualized basis.  Seeing as bitcoin already handles more than 20% of what eBay hopes to conduct in auctions and PayPal transactions, I think that 10% is setting your sights a bit low.

Most people perceive having your computer (effectively) mint money on the internet as being "too good to be true", and they react accordingly - that it is too good to be true.  When you tell them that it's computer based, their first instinct is to say that it will be hacked.  Why?  Because we've been told over and over that it will take "millions of years to hack this!" and then hear stories all over the news about how something got hacked - pay no attention to the fact that it was socially engineered or whatever... the "hack" is what sticks in folks mind.
Insulting people's logic or knowledge isn't going to do anything to open their mind to something, but will only harden their convictions that they are right, and you are wrong.  Also, there's no way to show someone that it can "never be hacked", that's like asking someone in the 50s to prove that we would never make it to the moon - it was completely clear that we couldn't do it, why would someone need to "prove" it?  Maybe not the best analogy, but you get what I mean, I hope.

You can break it already by flooding transactions - hit the block chain with 100k transactions a minute for an hour and see what happens.  Three letter agencies have the compute power and disposable cash to do this for days straight.  What are the devs gonna do?  Fork repeatedly? Emergency patch?

The EFF is 100% on point.  There are massive potential legal issues with Bitcoin.  As soon as a first world government feels like messing with it, it won't stop the network, bit it WILL pretty much instantly kill all legitimate business use.
This will drastically hinder widespread adoption of it, and will create a rush to get out of it.   A digital run on the bank, as it were.
Businesses are prudent to wait on legal clarification in my opinion.

I'd try to squeeze another $140 and pick up the little single SC.  30 Ghash/s, and even if you ordered it now, it would likely pay for itself in 4-6 months, and then earn you that much again in btc in another year assuming the exchange rates hover where they're at now (around $30 USD / btc).
If you are inclined to believe the zealous forecasts of $50-$100 (or more) prices for btc in the coming year, then buy coins.  If you're a bit more pragmatic, then buy a miner.  Clearly you don't think that the price will collapse, otherwise you wouldn't be considering any of this, hah.

In the short term, sure.  Look at it right now, however.  Are you, Mr. Big Business Owner, going to sit on a bunch of virtual coins and hope they don't drop back to their price 30 days ago?  Hell no you aren't, you're going to dump them and convert to your local currency as fast as possible, so you aren't stuck with a huge loss from an overnight swing in the exchange rate.
Basically it adds more overhead expense - you have to have someone do the exchange, and you have to pay for the exchange fee... and you have to then wait on the money to hit your bank account.  It messes with your cash flow, it costs you a tangible expense, and it costs you the labor associated with dealing with it.
As it stands right now, it makes utterly NO sense at all for a business to deal with this, unless it can be entirely automated.  And even then, are they going to get enough incremental revenue to cover the costs of putting those systems in place?  Right now, I'd say that the answer is probably a resounding 'no'.
I love the idea of the bitcoin, but it has a massive amount of "growing up" to do before it's even remotely viable for Joe Q. Public and most businesses.

It would need a cap closer to a trillion (current) USD in order to be an attractive, realistic alternative for any country.  Otherwise a shift would never happen, as people flat out would not migrate to a digital currency that was valued at least two orders of magnitude lower than the aggregate value of everything in a country the size of Argentina.  Their current GDP was $445B USD in 2011.
That's just one year of production.  The notion that BTC could possibly replace a sovereign fiat is just silliness right now.  Until it appreciates 5000x to 10000x, you're just fantasizing about riding your flying unicorn to starfleet headquarters.
