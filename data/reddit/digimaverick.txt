Haha 1-5%... man I'm sitting here with just about every chip on the table right now.  I don't even have 1-5% FIAT.

1. No - I have a day job with a conventional monthly salary.  That covers most outgoings.  About a year ago I moved our family life savings lock, stock and barrel into crypto... all of it.  I figured I'd rather have our chips in crypto than Fiat.  It took at least a month to convince the wife... but well worth it.  Risk wise, I'm not day trading ALTs on mad leverage or anything, just HODLing the obvious front runners from each of the top 3 crypto use-case categories (I.e. store of value (BTC), utility/protocols (ETH) and privacy (XMR).  Conservatively expecting another &gt;10x this year.
2. No - I'm in London, UK

plenty of reasons for this... anyone expecting a lower declared income in 2017 than 2018 would have motive. Trading losses, lower earnings through maternity/paternity leave, mid-year relocation to/from overseas, unpaid sabbaticals, sale of assets planned for 2018... it often makes sense to max out the low tax brackets.

Cryptosteels are known to take weeks to arrive... one small company servicing a user base growing by millions every week... on the plus side, they are F***ing awesome.

Just the kind of headline needed to support a new effort to criminalise crypto. I can see it now, CNN and BBC reporting breaking news "North Korea using crypto currency to evade sanctions" quickly equated to Bitcoin = Nuclear threat to the world...
Anonymous DPRK sources reporting to anonymous UN officials... bulshit from 50 paces.

Haha - yeah I hope.  These guys live and die by the security of their coins.  I'm generally happy to place trust in people once I have a measure of their character, and I'd spent weeks reading about the build stages before I bought my first Kialara a few years back, I quite like the production values and the p/key binding process is solid. The artist Max blogs through the build process and I quite like that, you can learn a lot about someone from the language they use.

Nice work. You should totally talk to Max (the Kialara guy)
This type of art would be perfect for the Kialara signature series... some of the best and most prized premium physical BTC wallets on the planet, usually featuring guest artists and (more recently) blockchain themed art:

FiniteByDesign do some pretty cool self loadable hard wallets.  They come as a kit, print your p/key as a QR code and affix under the holographic tamper seals in the assembly kit.
Their website is a bit of a mess but the FB page is okay... 
They're solid units and I recommend them if you like the kit-form approach, I gave out of a bunch of the ETH bars out to my Groomsmen when I got married last year with an ETH pre-loaded on each... it was about $8 back then.

Chill with the hate. "S-curve" is not technical jargon, it is the distinct form of technology adoption curves (as opposed to the conventional bubble graphs...).  Think microwaves, the internet, mobile phones, electricity, etc... The point here is if btc is tracking a tech-adoption curve, then it finishes at the top. Not the bottom.  That is arguably the most important distinction one can make if interested in the price, far more valuable a lesson than BS real life stories about tulips... or pizzas.
In this case the technology is that of a low cost, secure, private electronic store if value... Not the day to day ubiquitous transactional medium shite... that dream may come... (it may not) but is not affecting BTC price now.  We are talking about tech-adoption as a more efficient store of value... and in that regard it is technically superior its competition (fiat, gold, etc). Superior tech is always adopted. If you think about it enough, fiat is a technology. If you think about it even longer... So is gold.
The even more interesting graph is the acceleration of tech adoption curves over the last century.  
I can't paste an image but I'll post a link just below to the image you need to see - yes another graph. Another useless graph.... But worth looking at.

Go for mBTC... I've heard you can get nearly 1000 times as much for the same price

Pub/key is visible.  P/key sits behind the tamper proof seal on the coin inside.  The silver coin sits behind glass windows on both sides, housed by the brackets in the pic. Those are screwed in, screws are glued to set then the screw heads are drilled out to secure the unit. They are VERY heavy.

Love this, totally agree with the subtext too. 
Well worth pegging a sell in for 5% shy of the $10k and $100k logarithmic milestones, both obvious short term reversal points, rebuy the dips and saddle up for the million dollar moon landing baby.

100k Bits = 0.1 BTC
The "100,000 Bit" denominators actually are my  bugbear...
The denomination is pretty much irellevant since these are shipped empty and users can load whatever balance they want... Big difference in price with the 500k and 2BTC editions... with no physical differences, the only visible diff being the stated value (I.e. the rarity of higher denominations commands a premium).

No it isn't. Think in percentage terms not linear.
Sustained imbalance in supply/demand causes precentage movements... linear values are irellevant.
Effort to move through each order of magnitude is the same.
