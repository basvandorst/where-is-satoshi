Planet X has got me hot and steamy

Horrible advice but its what I do: Never report and they never know you have crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:03:56
Fuck, do I have to declare the 3.4 million souls I have in Ds3? I don't know if I want to be taxed on that, considering I could lose it all in one day to a ganker.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:43:20
I'm talking about the people who buy and sell people, crack, illegal weapons, etc on TOR.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:31:03
What I got out of this: just keep buying bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:22:10
On my phone so, that's a no. But thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:27:56
Lets be honest: people who do shady shit use bitcoin. Which helps drive the price up for us. I'm not complaining though. :)
Edit: Bring on the downvotes! Y'all just mad cause its true! (Partially anyway)
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:34:10
You can ban what you can't control. Viva la Revolution!
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:37:18
Lol no dude. I've just been dying to get involved. But besides buying hashrate from companies to mine for me I don't understand how people do it. Bitcoin or other altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:01:18
Because it is hard to trace, people doing illicit services value it. These services being very expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:18:08
It probably would be less noticed, and not as many blocks mined. Honestly the worst case scenario would have been that we were set back a few months to a year.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:09:01
This is correct. Until the interest isntheblargest thing we try to pay off. Then the economy is in the shitter.

Educate myself? Please. Not that it matters since its the internet and anyone can say anything, but I'm well educated.
However, thabks for listing sources! Very frw people actually list sources when "debunking" others. Ill be sure to take a look when I'm home and not on mobile. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:41:15
We're sorry, your call cannot be continued as dialed. Please hang up, and try again later.

All still majorly capitalist. Also: what list?
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:33:18
And what does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:39:56
Name a single communist/socialist country that ever worked and had a non corrupt government. Try me.
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:42:29
Asking the real questions.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:11:36
But who keeps relying?
Wait... Shit.
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:37:57
Venezuela used to be a capitalist country. Then their "president" removed term limitations and started taking over the private buisnesses into the government. Aka, communism.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:31:22
Fuckin libtards wanting free shit. "Look at Venezuela" yeah I have. They failed. Called it 
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:02:10
Wow! Socialism doesn't work? But its DEMOCRATIC Socialism! I was told it would be different!
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:55:42
Wait wait wait, I can buy a bitcoin atm and place it in my town? Fuck yeah man.
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:40:01
When people don't work and they get mad, they post this.
Doesn't even have anything to do with BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:20:00
Nope. I'm thinking somewhere else. What I'm asking is: its possible to buy a BTC ATM? Caue if so, I want to do it.
I live nowhere near Cali or Washington. Other coast.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:15:22
So the bitcoin cash currency is literally just a scam?
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:49:44
Is this a meme? Seriously?
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:20:12
Your IP tells coinbase your location. Mask your IP with a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and choose a free country that doesn't regulate you to death. Coinbase will think you are in that country and you can sell.
Also: Just don't use coinbase. Theyve sold out their customers information to multiple companies and governments.
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:28:36
I use the Cash app for cashing out, moving, or buying small amounts. But thats just my personal taste.
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:15:43
Use a VPN?
@_date: 2018-06-19 16:07:19
Instuctions unclear, dick caught in ceiling fan.
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:43:50
Want to try again boss?
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:17:40
Right but if bitcoin goes up another grand in a week, I could just as easily pay them back before the first month is out, couldn't I? I don't know how this shit works. But bitcoin is getting more and more expensive and I have no idea where to start. Its not like I can mine. And there's no tutorial. The easiest way seems to buy in.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:00:21
I'm really wondering if I should take out a loan from the bank and buy a whole bitcoin, and sell off the loan price in bitcoin a week later and keep the rest.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:11:05
Lol sorrym at work with shit service. But thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:16:09
Thabks so much you're a beast.
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:34:40
Oh? Ok then. I thought they were just trying to track what people had and taxed them anyway, not just when you sell out. Because I honestly don't want to ever. Its a currency. I like to use it as such.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:10:32
The first positive comment I've seen. Thank you. Ill see if I cant use somensort of VPN
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:09:15
Lol what? Of course I do. But I don't want the IRS coming after me for 50k in gains right before a drop to ten bucks. (Exagerated but you get the point)
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:03:19
Literally just need one day a year where no one drives cars (besides emergency vehicles) Make it a Sunday in the United States. Minimum impact.
That and Nuclear Energy. Not solar or Wind which uses a shitton if a EXTREMEMLY limited lithium source, and not to mention the literal measurement of a shitton of oil used to produce these horribly inefficient panels and windmills.
Nuclear is the way to go.
That and catching close comets and asteroids rich with resources and minerals that we cant possibly even fathom. Which would literally bring in new resources and Mass to the planet. Not technically "renewable" but Definately never ending compared with humanities lifespan as a species. I sincerely doubt we will run out of asteroids and comets to catch before humanity dies out.
Edit: Also, I have no fucking idea how bitcoin even remotely coresponds to the planets literal ecosystem. Should repost this to a sub reddit who cares like green peace or something.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:27:51
If you follow any of those sources, this is all based on speculation and personal opinion. Absolutely NONE of this is factual or proven.
Fake news.
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:31:02
So how does giving him attention get his coins back?
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:35:29
Lol its not
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:13:23
How though? Just fucking how? I hate how big companies can immediately monopolize a new thing.
