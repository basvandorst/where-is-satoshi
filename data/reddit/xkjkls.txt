Amazon and Overstock operate on completely different scales. Last year, Overstock had a revenue of $1.3 billion and a market cap of $500 million.
Amazon had a revenue of 80 billion ( 30% of global online retail ) and a market cap of 160 billion. Amazon also has a higher revenue growth rate than Overstock, even with the larger base.
What moves the ticker for Overstock will not be the same for Amazon.

I think you would be surprised at all the buttons a customer might accidentally hit. 
We tend to assume all online shoppers  have some technical know-how, but for Amazon, many of them are the same people with twenty-five toolbars in Internet Explorer. 
Given how fragile an online order is, you can't be certain it'd be worth the risk.

That still doesn't give them too much reason to mess with their payment experience. In online retail, so so many orders die at checkout screen. People get cold feet. 
At Amazon's scale, if the number of people who might get distracted by, "what's this pay with Bitcoin thing?" is greater than increased sales due to Bitcoin, then it's not worth the risk.

Value doesn't come from how innovative you find the idea. Value is about people using the product.
Facebook is a company that has 900 million people who interact with it's product *every single day*. That's value.
WhatsApp handles more than a hundred *billion* messages sent every single day. 
Bitcoin? Bitcoin is laughably small in comparison to how much those products are used.

You'd be surprised at how easily orders are won and lost at checkout.
Here's an article about how slow shopping cart pages affect conversion:
The headliner is that a delay of two seconds (two seconds!) while checking out will drop sales by 60%. It's not inconceivable that someone seeing Bitcoin could be distracted for that amount of time.

Yahoo! also owns 35% of Yahoo! Japan, which is a separate company valued at 23 billion dollars. If you add up the sum of the parts, the American Yahoo business has little to no value.

Unionpay is the only bank card in China. It's huge. It also doesn't function any differently than MasterCard or Visa, whereas Bitcoin does completely. 
For Bitcoin, if you have a button "pay with Bitcoin", that changes the page from "enter your credit card information" to "enter your hash", that's going to confuse a lot of people.

Facebook turns a mild profit? They made $1.5 billion in 2013, and on track to clock in $3 billion this year. There's less than 200 other companies in the world who make more cash than they do.
