Except it's raining so much it's starting a flood
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:58:54
Alts follow bitcoin most of the time so you're ok
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:42:41
Just hodl. You're gonna get back some gains when it reaches close to 10k
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:40:56
For this ROCKET TO THE MOON
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:30:08
Okay, let's ignore lightning completely and say technology isn't progressing.

I just checked with the translator and it's correct lol
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:52:40
Seems located at 7k this time
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:57:46
"Slow". "Healthy".

Long term bear market, short term rally. Good moment to buy.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:13:19
The dip is the lower price. You sold at the lower price
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:41:18
No we weren't. High resistance at 10k is not that easy to break. But we will soon, my friend.
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:10:01
1m in 3 years, according to 
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:11:20
You sold during the dip? Okay good luck
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:17:28
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:45:18
The floor is 6k and we're going that way
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:46:58
Consolidation zone usually means price will go up or down soon. The longer the consolidation zone, the more drastic movement will be. As the setup suggests, we will probably continue a bull run close to 10k

These daily posts are made to talk about daily stuff, like price and sentiment, or things affecting Bitcoin like daily news. Informative or educational things aren't daily based, so I suggest you look somewhere else if you don't like to discuss daily stuff.

Mass adoption, which is very hard right now because of transaction times and fees. Don't worry, lightning is comming to save the day, but it needs time to develop
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:40:56
Yes, the price can go up or down
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:36:53
Cool, that means I can buy tons at 1k
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:58:28
Mt. Gox 
@_date: 2019-08-26 21:59:08
Soon. But first buy the dip.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:25:47


Maybe $0.00
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:43:32
Me gusta yogurt
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:20:45
Everyone will sell as soon as it hits 9400, so expect a big drop after that.
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:02:12
because it's based entirety of what people think it should be worth, and their emotions. bitcoin is like a woman 
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:22:42
Eat rice?
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:15:30
YouTube banned bitcoin ads. Scam companies relying on YouTube ads are probably selling all their bitcoins. Expect 6k bottom
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:44:41
Sell before it reaches 1000
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:58:33
Sell before it bottoms at 6k, then buy the true dip
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:32:32
Mining won't stop until we reach 5k. Bitcoin can only be mined with ASICs, which are worthless for other purposes and can only be sold to other miners. At current mining difficulty, 5k would cost more light in some countries than profits, and some miners will be forced to stop until difficulty goes down.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:05:23
I am just relaxly crying
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:27:40
Nice pump. Time for dump.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:09:49
Video games. Now I play vintage video games with my PC while selling hashing power and my soul, for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:25:45
I feel bitcoin will bend over and moon us instead
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:42:58
Only when we're above 12k
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:38:44
Probably beyond the moon. It's going straight to Uranus.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:22:42
Days of strife
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:56:39
Not so fast, we might see a break above resistance soon.
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:23:00
Stability? Like dropping 60% in a few months lol
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:54:29
Only if you drive fast enough
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:58:15
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:10:14
Mt. Gox sold more bitcoins causing a big dip 
Bull market continues.
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:03:06
Is that a horse? We only buy cars with the bull logo in this sub
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:51:55
TO THE MOON

@_date: 2018-04-19 14:44:03
Amazon can't use bitcoin because its too slow, at least until lightning gets more developed. My bet is Amazon will make its own altcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:57:26
Your comments are pointless as ever
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:11:48
OVER 9000? There's no way that can be right
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:09:43
It's so predictable now when it already happened
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:29:37
I doubt it, I heard mods don't have any fiat money at all
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:59:28
Earn? You mean mine? Buy an ASIC miner.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:25:06
I think we might break the 8400 barrier and head up to 8700
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:19:19
There are too many altcoins increasing their value at crazy rates, and they increase the value of bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:00:18
Remember when people said buy at 10.700 because it was cheap?
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:54:08
And you don't have a wife or kids, and you have your own house, and you aren't addicted to gambling. Well since you're here, you probably are.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:05:15
Wait until tomorrow, price gonna drop even more because of US taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:46:08
Hodl only if day closes above 8300
