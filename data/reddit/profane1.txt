For those interested in TV coverage tune into CNBC, they seem to be talking Bitcoin every 20 minutes or so.

Exactly and this response was perfect.  Bill jokes about bitcoin because it is easy to especially when he doesn't understand it.
If he learns what bitcoin truly is maybe he will be more positive about it on his show like his pro weed stance every week.

It's not about taking his jokes too seriously, I don't think anyone is. Even this video response mentioned buying a unicorn lol.  It's about getting him to be pro bitcoin.  He's cracking jokes because he doesn't understand how revolutionary it really is.  Heres a guy already talking about bitcoin on his hit political show, now let's just educate him.

yep, even the pages here look so different, I find myself double checking every time .

It's not about being sensitive and needing thick skin. It's about getting the guy who is *already* talking about bitcoin on his popular tv show to understand and be more positive about it.

The same reason people pay to watch sports, they love the competition of it. A twitch subscriptions removes the commercial advertisements I believe.
