Hello, 
I'm responding with regard to your concern about payment using your bitcoin. 
I'm sorry; but our system is currently not accepting bitcoin as one of our payment method. 
However, I'll assure you that I'll be forwarding this message to appropriate department. I really hope we'll be able to bring bitcoin as our payment method while we plan further improvements on our site. 
For further reference: 
Currently we accept credit cards, debit cards, payment from U.S. checking accounts, Amazon.com Gift Cards, Amazon Payments Stored Balance, and the Amazon.com Store Card. Here are the credit cards we accept: 
-- American Express 
-- Diner's Club (U.S. billing addresses only) 
-- Discover 
-- MasterCard 
-- Visa, Visa Electron, and Visa Check Cards 
-- Eurocard 
-- JCB 
-- NYCE 
-- STAR 
-- China UnionPay (credit card only) 
You can learn more about these payment methods on our Help pages: 
 
We gladly accept debit and ATM cards, as long as they're connected with one of the major credit card companies--namely Visa (including Visa Electron), MasterCard, Eurocard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, or JCB. If you see the symbol of one of these companies on your card, then you can use it just as you would a regular credit card. 
For more information, please visit our Help pages: 
 
We look forward to assist you.
Best regards,
Dinesh C

Hey! Long story short is that we don't! This has been brought to our attention a few times and we'll be removing it in the next release. :) (It's old technical debt from an alpha feature that didn't make the v1 cut!)

Dev here! Would love to know what you think of the Cheddur app! We launched 2 weeks ago and are trying to get the word out! :)

Agreed. The temptation to play the market is so strong due to the volatility. Takes discipline and experience to keep away from the exchanges sometimes!

If you need any help understanding what Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are, or how to go about buying them / selling them / sending them / receiving them / storing them... THIS APP IS FOR YOU!
Over the last few years, I've helped dozens of people get started with the tools and knowledge they need to take their first steps into the world of digital currency... but I haven't been able to help as many as I wish I could. So about 2 years ago, I decided that in order to help as many people as possible, I needed to find a way to reach a larger audience. I couldn't find one... so I decided to build one. And thus, Cheddur was born.
I truly believe that digital currencies (a.k.a “cryptocurrencies” or “coins”) are completely revolutionizing the way we think about and exchange money online, and I want everyone to benefit from them. Cheddur is a digital copy of everything I know about digital currency, and then some.
Please give it a try - and let me know what you think!! And don't forget to drop by Bitcoin's page and to let others know what you think!
