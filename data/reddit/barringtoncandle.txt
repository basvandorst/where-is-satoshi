Looks Great! Thank you very much.

They do not. The Soy wax we use is unscented and we currently offer 18 flavors of candles. Some smell so great that you'll want to eat them...but we do not recommend it.
If you'd like an unscented candle, we can certainly do that. One of our next product offerings will be all natural bees wax candles, they have a nice soft scent of honey.

Very true! Please do not purchase if you have Soy Allergies.
For those with Soy Allergies, we are releasing a Beeswax candle in the next month. Stay tuned!

Soybeans are far more sustainable than Paraffin, which is typically used in candles. Most Paraffin candles are also made overseas, these are made in Barrington, Illinois and every component of our product is made in the USA. 
Paraffin is made from petroleum and coal. If you are going to enjoy a candle then Soy is the way to go.

Will do! GAH its so frustrating, it appears to be a problem with shopify.com which hosts my shopping cart...I will keep you updated.

Good question! The Soybean is a renewable and sustainable resource. Soy candles burn longer, slower, and colder than typical Paraffin candles. They also do not create as much soot and burn much cleaner. 
The Soy we source is also grown in the USA and all components of our candles are Made in the USA.

Soybean production is most definitely sustainable.
