For all the things you listed you need a third party, which makes the blockchain perfectly useless since it cancels the concept of trustless. The third part is used to draft the documents, verify them, validate them and, what is no less important, the documents may contain inaccuracies or falsehoods. Which again makes the blockchain useless.

Bitcoin is a new type of value reserve acting as a currency of exchange. It is like gold, in the sense that it is scarce and that it is an asset to which value is given. Let us remember that "value" is not a property of matter but is a purely human abstract concept. Unlike gold, however, bitcoin is not falsifiable, has a known shortage, is highly divisible and can be sent to any part of the world without the need to rely on intermediaries. Bitcoin, unlike other valuable assets such as the house, the automobile or its current account, does not need a central body to certify the ownership (and therefore it could also revoke it). If you have the private key of your wallet you are the owner of the bitcoins it contains and no one can ever expropriate them. If you leave from the USA and want to go to Russia bringing with you the value of 10 million dollars, with bitcoin you can do it because it is enough that you carry with you the two keys, public and private, of the wallet that contains them. You don't have to ask anyone's permission. You just do it. Try doing it with any other asset! Study it well because it is revolutionary.

I personally don't agree. Technical analysis offers you the forecast that statistically has the highest probability of occurring. With that in hand you can decide a strategy. Obviously, 100% certainty is not given to you by anyone, but knowing where the price is most likely to move in the long run is an advantage.

Technical analysis statistically works because traders tend to create self-fulfilling forecasts.
If the scenario is bearish, most of them will sell by doing so, in fact, drop the price.
Same thing if the scenario is bullish. If you begin to follow the technical analysis seriously you will immediately notice these things.

No, I'm European. It seems strange to me that an American is not free to do, with his own money, what he wants. You cannot participate in ICOs, you can buy bitcoins in the exchanges and you can trade them but with a lot of difficulty and many limits. If you hold them, the tax authorities can worry you even about airdrops or forks and therefore make this type of investment dissuasive for many. From the point of view of cryptocurrencies you are not so free to do what you want. There is not so much difference between you and China. At least that's what is perceived here in Europe. But is that okay for you? Nobody protests?

You're right and you're wrong at the same time. In these 10 years bitcoin has only been a tool of speculation and probably will be for another 5 or 10 years. Its real value, however, is given by being a new rare investment asset that vaguely resembles gold, or diamonds, but unlike these it is digital with all the benefits of the virtual world. For example it is easily divisible, it can be sent to every part of the planet in a few minutes and, above all, it is peer-to-peer. There is no need for anyone's consent to handle it. It can also be used as cash and can meet the needs of that part of the world that cannot have a bank account. And I'm talking about 3 billion people. Believe me that in the long run we will feel the need for such a thing. And I'm talking about simple people, companies, institutions and entire States.
I would add that the volatility is now high because there is very little adoption. The more the bitcoin will be required and the more the price will stabilize because it will be increasingly difficult for the big whales, who today manipulate the price with a few million dollars, to be able to move the charts.

It depends on your age obviously.
If you have 30 years in 10 years, you will have 60 years left to live and you will need at least 3 million dollars, considering inflation. In fact, 3 million divided by 60 = 50,000 dollars a year to spend.
If in 10 years you will be 60, you will have 30 left to live and you will need 1.5 million dollars.
Imagining that in 10 years bitcoin is worth $ 500,000 (plausible) you will need 6 if you are 20 and 3 if you are 50.
Make the calculations.

If many will arbitrage, the prices between the exchanges will tend to line up, making arbitrage unprofitable. And, to date, already many are making arbitrage with bots. Anyway, I'm curious. It takes a free trial period to test the product though.

Actually, you couldn't buy bitcoins when it was worth $ 3200 and you're angry like a hyena now. I'm sorry. But know that you are still in time. In reality it is never too late. However, you do not need to contact bitcoin owners as if they were a religious sect or a group. Everyone is different and everyone has their own idea about the future of this new financial asset. So focus on what YOU think. If you think bitcoin has no future, don't buy it and stop caring about this world. Nobody forces you to do anything friend.

At the heart of the matter we must always put two things: money and greed.
With bitcoin and LN, in fact, Zuckerberg could gain in 4 ways:
1) Additional fees for each exchange
2) Slight change in exchange rates to earn hidden fees
3) Sale of personal data relating to purchase preferences
4) A disproportionate increase in the value of bitcoin. By accumulating a lot of them first, buying them in the OTC market, he would make quite a few pennies there too.
With bitcoin, however, Zuckerberg has a big problem: its value is not stable and would convince few people to use it every day for purchases and value shifts.

A power plant cannot know how many Kw / h will be consumed a little later and therefore it will always produce a little more than the average calculated consumption. That "little more", if nobody uses it, will be lost forever, this is a fact. And it is here that bitcoins can intervene, which will use that surplus of energy to transform it into value, which can be accumulated and spent in the future.
But how many power plants do you think were built, in the world, only to mine bitcoins? Apart from a few small solar plants practically zero. Bitcoin currently uses excess energy.

Once only one of your wallets is discovered by the tax authorities, the tax authorities can ask you for an account of each exit and each entry simply by entering the public address in the search box of [blockchain.info]( You can't do it with cash.

An asset has value if it is scarce and if there is a lot of demand. If the demand is not there, that good can be very scarce, nothing will be worth. The demad is the most important thing. If bitcoin loses interest in the future, simply because it systematically disappoints all the economic expectations of the owner, I am sorry but its value will tend to zero. And certainly not halving to fix things.

I fear that bitcoin is tolerated by states only because it will be the currency that people will get used to using electronic payments. It will be the way they will make us accept the elimination of cash banknotes. Electronic payments, which will be passed off as more efficient and modern, will earn the banks due to the commissions and allow a capillary control of State transactions on the citizens. In practice, thanks to bitcoin, which will soon be forgotten and replaced with national cryptocurrencies, we will all have a worse future. I'm sorry but this is what I think. I hope I'm wrong...

Any currency, or gold-supported token would not work that way. It would take a central entity that accumulates as much gold as there are tokens (for example bitcoins) that it distributes. In this way those tokens could be transformed into gold at any time by returning them to this central entity. Since bitcoin is decentralized it can only be supported only by itself.

Bitcoin does not consume energy. Use the excess produced by power plants and not used by individuals and companies. If it were not used for mining it would be wasted. Bitcoin, therefore, does not pollute and does not heat but transforms the extra energy into value and network security.

If there is a monetary crisis, the states will become even more fierce with bitcoins, in order to defend their currency.

In my opinion, it's a kind of scam, here are the tests:
1) There are no faces of the owners of this business anywhere. Only generic company descriptions.
2) The site was registered last year and expires next year. Registration is anonymous and the server is in Panama, and these are never a good sign.
I would stay away from it. But I can't tell you more.
@_date: 2019-09-20 08:23:51
The site registration data is all hidden:
There is no news on the site about the company or the people who run it. Nothing is known.
These are the first things to look at to distinguish a scam from a legitimate site.
You have lost some money and you will probably never see them again. Don't be discouraged, at first it happens almost to many. It is a world full of dangers.
The best way to invest in cryptocurrencies, if you are a novice, is to buy bitcoins (bitcoins only) and hold them in a private wallet for a few years. End.
To buy them safely I recommend Coinbase ([ which is a legitimate site and is one of the most famous and safe exchanges in the world. It's a bit expensive as commissions but at least it doesn't steal your money.
To understand how to generate a private wallet, look for a tutorial on YouTube. Or download Electrum ([ which is one of the most used and secure private portfolios. Its code is open source and therefore is under tight control by the developer community.
