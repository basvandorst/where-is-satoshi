I love how everyone's downvoting it... Nobody's even tried it :/

PROOF that it works!

I just ordered a 560 Ti from Ebay through all4btc. Took like 6 hours for the email to arrive, but they ordered it. Should be here on 27-29 of January, 2014. I'll give you an update on what's going on when/if I get it. I do think they're legit, though. Again, I got the email from them, which was a screenshot of the Ebay order. So, we'll see where it goes from here...

Well, this would be a giant boost for Bitcoin. Do it... Maybe do a promotion. Make a pepperoni pizza, but make the pepperoni in the shape of the Bitcoin logo. Call it "The Big Coin." Offer a coke with it. I can just imagine it! "Pizza Hut is proud to introduce: THE BIG COIN! Only $10! Bitcoin is here! Order online today!" *for a limited time only!

But, in the post, I was saying that the customer was an undercover federal authority. They would arrest you for money laundering or not having a transmitter license.

It would've been quite a bit cooler if it was orange :P

I'm here in PA. I'll take 1 if I know the shipping price.

Dangit. Alright. Kinda wanted to just have a little Jally running.

"It's all gone, but I gotta stay high all the time!"
First thing that came to mind reading this.

I... I'm a guy though...

I guess I'm fake. Or this is fake. To be honest, I really don't care if the school finds out. Actually, I want the teacher to see this. I know this completely changed, but what am I doing wrong? I'm telling the internet/Reddit about the teacher who docked me of 2 grades that brought me down to an over-all C average. I still don't think I'm ready to say her FULL name yet. I will say the letter "T" occurs 1 time in her name.

Man. I wish I had I had you as a teacher!
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:17:28
I actually normally love school. It's self paced, which means I can sometimes get done in less than an hour! But, it's times like this that make me, well, hate it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:03:01
Oh trust me, I already knew that most teachers suck... I'll post about that one some other time...
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:18:25
Guys, I'm not going to give her name. It's a cyber school. I'll leave it to you to figure out who it is. I'm trying to remain anonymous. If you figure out who it is, I still won't tell you. It's not so much for her as it is for my protection.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:23:27
I actually am not a new user. This account is to be anonymous so I can't be traced back. I really don't want the school finding out who I am. Trust me, I really don't want to get suspended or expelled.
