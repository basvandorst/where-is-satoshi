Let them have the fiat. We'll keep taking their coins. $10,000 is cheap for a Bitcoin when it's headed for $1,000,000 as a reserve currency. You're thinking short-term. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:22:04
At a $1 million dollar value bitcoin would represent less than 6% of global wealth and could exist as a reserve currency alongside FIAT. If it goes even higher it could certainly supplant the dollar. One major thing that could theoretically spark that is if countries started accepting btc for oil. That would create massive demand and thus raise price, but the US gov't has gone to war with countries (the ones without nukes) that don't sell oil for dollars because they need the increased demand to prevent massive inflation and allow them to print more and more money and create a larger deficit.

Amazon Shopping. Just kidding, kind of. There is a lot of scaling that needs to be figured out before small transactions in commerce. Right now Bitcoin is best used as a store of value in my opinion. And I think it's best that way anyway until Bitcoin reaches 500,000 to a million dollars. At that point you won't see it as many crazy jumps and it will be at a market cap that's on par with gold and legitimate currencies.

Bitcoin is anonymous. It's better if good people buy them now not later when a coin is over $1 million each (2023).
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:59:32
Yes. Here's why:
Let's just say the combined wealth of the entire world is 250 Trillion USD (it's way more). There will only be 21 million Bitcoins ever mined and of those you can subtract 4 million because the keys were lost or destroyed and 1 million is attributed to a creator who could be dead or uninterested in the coins. Also the final million won't be mined in any of our lifetimes. So, 21 - 6 = 15. If there is global demand for Bitcoin and each coin is worth 1 million dollars that still only accounts for 6% of global wealth. 
Bitcoin has gone up 1,000,000X since the beginning. If it continues its growth rate it will be $250,000 by 2020 and $1 million by 2023. 
The way bitcoin is divided up works on the metric system. Since it is divisible it's really easy to split a bitcoin down to a penny when its  worth $1 million:
1 penny = .00000001
1 dime = .0000001
1 dollar = .000001
10 dollars = .00001
100 dollars = .0001
1,000 dollars = .001
10,000 dollars = .01
100,000 dollars = .1
1,000,000 dollars = 1 bitcoin 
The zeros go on the opposite side and this will become a comfortable system for people. If bitcoin is to be a world reserve currency it needs to be in the million dollar value range.

Jamie Dimon is the CEO of JP Morgan which is one of the Central banks that own the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve gave away more than $16 Trillion dollars to FOREIGN ENTITIES from 2008-2011 without the approval of THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT and told no one about it. The only reason we know is because of a partial audit demanded by Congress (they're still pushing for a FULL AUDIT SO CALL YOUR SENATORS). How is THAT not FRAUD? The Federal Reserve WILL try to manipulate the price of Bitcoin with their ENDLESS supply of printed money SO STOP SELLING THEM YOUR COINS. IF WE CAN GET 10 MILLION PEOPLE TO HODL UNTIL THE PRICE GOES TO AT LEAST A MILLION WE CAN CHANGE THE POWER STRUCTURE.

Nah. There are only 15 million coins to worry about. There will be plenty of people who take the coins and hodl them. There will be more dips along the way as hodlers take them. 2020 --&gt; $250,000. 2023 --&gt; $1,000,000. That's the growth rate. And the market cap at a million is less than 6% of global wealth. Just hodl and figure out how to buy more coins.  Don't worry about the price right now. It's a waste of time.

Like I said no one has a crystal ball, but I think it's Bitcoin and Litecoin's game to lose. If you believe in other coins' technologies then okay, but I'd be sure it's really novel and not just hype. Also be sure to check for pre-mining and production caps. The reason bitcoin can go up in value/unit so much is because the only way to make more of them is to make it smaller (zeros in the other direction). Most people don't think mathematically to understand that well enough. If it were too good to be true everyone would buy and hold for 10 years. It's not easy to do unless you believe in the technology and already have a plan to hold. My advice is to invest in as much btc and ltc as you can afford to lose and then put the coins in a paper wallet in a safe deposit box (it's like $20/year). But that's just what I do. Works for me though. I started buying in 2011 and I still buy because I believe it's still an incredibly underpriced asset. Just my opinion.

Yes, the average Joe is a lot closer to buying bitcoin than altcoin. 100,000 new signups on Coinbase alone in 1 day this week. They can buy BTC, LTC, and ETH there. That's it. 21 million coins isn't that many. People are getting on Coinbase because they are hearing about Bitcoin in the news and thinking about pulling the trigger. 3 years = $250,000, 6 years = $1,000,000 is my prediction based on the growth rate. Large trading volume will start to decline a lot once btc reaches those heights and it will become stable enough to act as a normal currency. By that time speed won't be an issue because hardware will have caught up. All just my opinions.

@_date: 2017-09-22 19:26:42
$25,000? Try $1,000,000. The market cap of gold is around $8 trillion. Bitcoin will need to cost $500,000 each to equal that cap (when you account for lost coins). At that point we'll be closer to a legit currency with less transfer to fiat which will reduce the big drops and be less subject to manipulation tactics from "Spoofies".

My point was that he isn't spending them on living the "high life" like you suggested he should do. It would be shortsighted to sell them now.

The protocol has already proven itself. It's never been hacked and never lost a transaction. Speed will be worked out due to chip advancements and just has to do with current hardware limitations in technology. Every coin that scales will face the same issue. Dominance has to do with faith and human psychology. Bitcoin has first-to-market faith. Litecoin has second-to-market and no hacks. Ethereum has been hacked and blew up due to marketing hype. The other stuff is mostly garbage I wouldn't bother with especially the coins without caps. These are all just my opinions. No one has a crystal ball.

Meaningless? 100,000 new Coinbase users signing up in 3 days doesn't seem meaningless to me. Bitcoin is becoming known to more investors that have actual disposable income to risk. Many of these people are parents and relatives of young early adopters who never had much money to invest for themselves, but who have convinced their parents that this could become a true reserve currency. New buyers increases demand and lowers supply. It doesn't seem that far-fetched to assume many people (who can afford it) will buy at least 1 bitcoin just to speculate. Due to fees on Coinbase it doesn't make sense to buy small fractions. And this is just one exchange. Lots of the fear selling may have been to/from new users getting their feet wet in addition to those in China who were cashing out obviously. But I think many hodlers in China are smart enough to just move their coins to offline storage, which they should have been doing anyway.

You'll just need to fill out the proper paperwork on your taxes showing where you bought in and out and you'll have to pay regular taxes on your gains for the year because capital gains are for longer term holds. Word of advice though; you're probably better off just buying and holding for 3 to 6 years. Look at the charts and record the growth rate. You'll see that price should be $250,000 in 2020 and $1,000,000 in 2023. You'll lose money due to fees and taxes over the longhaul if you try to trade even if you call the highs and lows (doubtful) due to compounding/exponential gains. By the time btc is 1 million you won't need to sell them. You'll be able to buy with them. Best of luck though.

I think this happens on a miniscale each time there is a new ATH. The technology announcement sparks buys. In my opinion, large retailers and service providers will start making news for accepting btc and ltc, which will spark buying and new buyers. It will really start to look more like the enlightenment slope after a few of those announcements. Probably 2-3 years away from that. In my opinion (if the growth rate stays the same) in 3 years btc = $250,000. I think it will then double twice before 2023. So my prediction is the enlightenment slope is from 2020 to 2023. People will be very upset they didn't get in earlier and they will buy the dip en masse at that last dip before the 2020 ATH.

Everything is wrong with that method. You'll have to fill out tons of tax paperwork and you'll lose more money than you would just holding it because you will have to pay transaction fees. Just work on buying as much as you can afford. Don't sell anything for 5 years just work and buy more bitcoin. In 5 years you'll end up with a lot more money saved up.

Bitcoin is insanely secure. It is a PROVEN protocol. Never been hacked. Never dropped a transaction. It has scaling issues, but all coins would face the same problem until hardware gets better. Don't underestimate faith in the namebrand. Litecoin is  in my opinion due to transaction cost, speed, namebrand, and only 81 million coin cap. Ethereum has a great PR team and some very cool ideas like smart contracts,  but it's been hacked. I'm not okay with that. Look out for scammy coins that have premining or no cap.

Hey, if you're lucky enough to call the highs and lows more power to ya. I don't have the crystal ball though so I'd rather work on making more than trying to be a trader. I'm not good at calling highs and lows.

You do realize there are less than 15 million coins to be traded and a large number of those are being hodled. Every day more and more people ALL OVER THE WORLD are becoming interested in buying 1 or more coins. Let's say there are 10 million coins being traded back and forth. It only takes a few million new hodlers to cause a massive decrease in supply. Sitting in cash and waiting for another big drop is risky. Maybe you're right, but maybe you're wrong. I'll just be over here hodling and trying to make more money to exchange for coins.

Dang. I'm sorry to hear this. I recommend to anyone reading this: When you go to make a wallet on bitaddress.org, save the page and go offline. Create your address and then print the page (make sure the printer is offline too). Don't transfer anything to addresses you don't have a page for. Keep these in a folder in a very secret place or even better, a safe deposit box (they're only like $20/year). Create several "sloppy wallets" to practice with small amounts. Make sure you're comfortable with the process before sending large amounts.

Anyone who is willing to give you Bitcoin in exchange for your Paypal payment is an idiot or a scammer. All the person has to do is have the charge reversed with PayPal and whoever was giving away the Bitcoin will never see that Bitcoin or the cash again.

Your explanations are unclear because you are dividing incompatible units. In my example, global wealth was generalized in terms of US dollar value which is why it was divisible by actual US dollars. Your example of dividing by another type of currency (European) doesn't make sense because you didn't convert total Global wealth into that currency.  Your reasoning is flawed because you are confusing units with buying power.

I'm sorry you're sad. Glad you're not selling. This is a hedge against the current global economic system. $5,000 is nothing for a reserve currency that caps out at 21 million units. No one can predict when the collapse could happen. BE PROUD AND KNOW YOU'RE BEING SMART HODLING THOSE COINS.

There is a set of emails Hal Finney made public. In one of the emails Satoshi mentions to Hal in passing at the very end that he just had a thought that in the future people will try to brute force a public key with their initials and he said just by chance he got his initials and that address started with "1NS". Now that could stand for Nakamoto Satoshi (reversed initials in Japan?) but I think it certainly could be Nick Szabo.

There are 7.5 Billion people in the world. There will be about 15 Million coins (accounting for lost coins,  Satoshi, etc). If every millionaire in the world wanted one Bitcoin they couldn't purchase it because there aren't enough. HOLDING is what will make the VALUE INCREASE. It's supply and demand. So whenever some daytrader dumps, a few HODLERS hopefully pick up those coins and they're "off-the-market", which means less supply and less market manipulation by big FIAT. HODLERS AREN'T HERE TO CASH OUT, WE'RE HERE TO HOLD UNTIL THE MARKET CAP IS SO HIGH AND THE SUPPLY IS SO LOW THE MARKET CAN'T BE MANIPULATED BY YOUR PRECIOUS GOVERNMENT OVERLORDS.

Just hodl. This is looooong term. I got in around that price too. Even have some Litecoin around $90. We've got to get in sometime we just got in right before a big drop. Would it have been awesome if our dollars would have stretched further now, of course, but nothing we can do just hold on. Whatever you do, don't sell. You don't lose any money if you don't sell.

Since she won't get many people who pay her in Bitcoin I'd set up a paper wallet on bitaddress.org (do it offline). Print the page with public and private addresses. Before putting this in a safe deposit box I'd make a copy of the public address and then let people scan the QR code if they want to pay her with btc. Have cards with an affiliate link to Coinbase for anyone who is curious about Bitcoin. Get $10 in btc for every referral. Don't worried about fluctuating price because not that many people are going to be paying with Bitcoin and she should just be holding it anyway.

I guess decentralization naturally comes with a lack of consensus. I believe hardware advances will end up solving most scaling problems once volatility chills and people start using coins instead of holding. At that point empty blocks won't matter. Right now hodling is the smartest move in my opinion because the price is going to have to go up 250 X to have the same buying power/market cap of traditional currency like the USD (3-6 years). Right now most people are using it as a store of value anyway. They can easily transfer btc into ltc on shapeshift for super cheap if they need to make small transactions. Sorry for the tangent. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:37:54
I believe more and more people will run nodes for transaction fees when profitable which it will be as value rises. Also, the world is a big place and there's too much money at stake for competing bitcoiners across the world to trust one localized mining pool with the blockchain. Won't happen.

Nah. There are only 15 million coins to worry about. There will be plenty of people who take the coins and hodl them. There will be more dips along the way as hodlers take them. 2020 --&gt; $250,000. 2023 --&gt; $1,000,000. That's the growth rate. And the market cap at a million is less than 6% of global wealth. Just hodl and figure out how to buy more coins.  Don't worry about the price right now. It's a waste of time.
