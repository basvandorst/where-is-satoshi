You act like this is a common thing, in fact this is extremely rare. 
In my 10+ years as PHP dev I only ran into a few of those issues and in both cases they were solved by code refactoring while PHP worked to resolve the actual bug in the original code.

Can you link to some stuff from 1980 to compare it to languages that are still in active development in 2014?
It's ironic that people who try to be cool and bash PHP end up looking stupid and out of touch (you obviously have not kept up with the language and randomly posting FUD).

That could be said for just about anything on both daemon and OS level.
If that does happen (super, super rare) and you are not tracking that and inspecting core dumps then you are not doing your job properly.

What have you written that's so awesome to make that idiotic jab at PHP?

You are an idiot. I don't need surge pricing while paying for bread.

I assure you that you are an idiot.
1. You may want to research people you are trying to educate with your ramblings.
2. What does Twilio have to do with Bitcoin? They are a communication protocol. My company has been in partnership with Twilio for several years now and I even wrote supporting libraries for them in 2013:  You can read about it on my blog: 
3. The payment industry has a different set of SLAs. If you can't pay for a Metrocard and instantly get it; that's a service outage. You can try to sell your (idiotic) argument to other idiots by quoting random SLA agreements.
Now do everybody a favor and shut the fuck up.

Actually, degraded performance in a payment processor counts as an outage.
Mastercard doesn't add $10 to your bill when their system crawls to a halt.
