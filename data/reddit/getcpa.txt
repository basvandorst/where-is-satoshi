All that wasted effort for a wack ass post 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:14
You can simply prove yourself wrong by looking at the crypto market right now. Everything is crashing, not just btc.  BTC crashes &gt; everything crashes. It's not a theory it's a fact.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:08:28
Bitcoin has nearly doubled in a month and you're wondering what is going on? Just sell you 10$ share already and sleep well.

Bitcoin will revisit its highs, maybe not tomorrow but definitely soon.

btc at 100k would mean roughly 1.8-2 trillion market cap. Apple is the largest company at 800B. Lets be a little realistic ok bubba

I’ll wait until three digits and accumulate :)

Zzzzzzzz people still believing in this shit

Yeah that’s what people have been saying since January. This is going to shit.

You know there’s applications for blockchain technology outside of bitcoin right?

@_date: 2018-09-06 14:12:58
You can believe in the tech, block chain, and also believe that btc will never see 20k again.

Wow imagine that! A crypto investor saying nice things about crypto!
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:48:05
3 digits are a lot more likely than 5 at this time 
@_date: 2018-09-07 03:00:08
Not why everything crashed...there are whales at play and they are making so much money of you guys. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:48:43
Maybe don't invest more than you're willing to lose on such a volition market? 
On a separate note, come back in a week you'll be ok.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:36
You're naive to think there's a crypto market without bitcoin. If bitcoin fails so do all the alt coins.

Comparing stock in real companies to a crypto currency? 
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:36:36
Right if your following this conversation you will see he compared stock and crypto apples to apples, far from the case. No one is saying there’s not similarities, I’m saying they’re not the same, or even nearly the same to be honest. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:28:23
����������fucking right dude 
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:25:13
What it’s been since it came down from 20k, 30% pumps followed by 70% dumps. Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:34:31
Because this is all a giant joke 
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:55:15
Interesting, I’ve never seen so many emojis used in actual context, I thought it was a meme. Anyway, because I’d rather put my money in less risky things, same question to you, why don’t you sell all your belongings and put your money in? Or is that $12 you have in there all you’ve got?
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:19:01
Is this supposed to be comforting? That is a MAJOR red flag. The only people able to make BTC blow up that much are people getting ready to dump it back onto you. Trust me you and your buddies holding $56 in BTC aren’t gonna be able to sustain this pump. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:21:52
Unpopular opinion, the reason it did was never about the technology behind it, it was the hype, everyone and their mother was buying bitcoin, now its crashed and no one will touch it again. The tech and all is great, but that was never why it spiked to 21k. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:02:02
My advice to you is the same. Good luck! 
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:47:33
Ok yeah, you have no idea what the fuck you’re talking about. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:30:30
No need to send me direct messages man, if you can’t understand the difference between stock and crypto, you’re not educated enough to be putting real money into this. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:40:40
HUGE psychological factor comes into play when you’re talking about a crypto currency being $20,000 as opposed to $1,200. Can’t pretend that’s not a thing. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:32:11
I mean I’m not a credit card fan or anything but, this is a reach. 90% of your everyday spending doesn’t have a 3% surcharge and most credit cards do 1.5-2% back. But spread your narrative boo. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:59:40
Yeah don’t worry, 99.9% of this sub probably has less than $100 invested but they’ll post shit like this nonstop. In reality, the people making BTC move up or down, could care less about a BTC subreddit. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:44:36
What do you consider sustainable? It simply existing? If bitcoin is all about the technology it offers, why does price matter? 
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:40:33
Yet, 99.9% of this sub hopes BTC pumps so they can convert it to fiat ��

@_date: 2019-01-04 15:32:55
Jesus when will you stop comparing bitcoin to stock
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:10:57
Because bitcoin is a dumb gamble 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:08:17
Nah you can just look at the last year and make a pretty educated guess that it is most definitely going down. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:06:02
Wow is this....a bull run?!
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:17:45
The only reason it ever got to 20k was because millions of regular people got fomo. The VAST majority of people didn’t care about the technology etc, they just cared to make a quick buck. Most got burned, some are still leaving. Extremely doubtful they’ll jump on this again.

LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY STICK IT TO THE BIG MAN
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:00:05
That’s true though lmfao? Stock is literally ownership of a company that directly produces things of value. Whereas BTC is ownership of thin air. Are you so dense?

There is much more BTC adoption today than at our ath. Meaning, exchanges, banks, states etc. and the price is below 4K. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:28:32
BTC will never be a reliable currency. It’s fluctuates too much.

????????????? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:46:17
People need to realize that mass BTC adoption does not mean 20k+ prices. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:27:13
“Soundest money of all time”  you can have $100 worth of BTC today and tomorrow it will be worth $56.35.

The point is going right over your tiny brain. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:26:11
Take your head out of your ass and stop jerking off to Japanese anime and read an actual book. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:28:35
You don’t, it’s simply a matter of what is the next person willing to pay for it. Bitcoin has no value outside of that. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:01:35
Hence my point, mass adoption doesn’t equal massive prices increase. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:52:42
Ohhh power bottom ;)
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:41:04
Hahahahah yeah investing in bitcoin is much smarter

You’re better off lighting your money on fire, at least you’d get some heat 
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:01:54
I stopped after your first poorly formed paragraph. You can’t say stock is only worth what people are willing to pay for it because stock is connected to a company’s earnings etc.
