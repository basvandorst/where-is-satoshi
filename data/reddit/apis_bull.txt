Pretty sure this is a scam
I think the real one is found on openbazaar.org and it’s only for desktop
Edit: I guess maybe not? Idk when you hit “download” it redirects you to the .org address

which is why i am weary of using tools built by the NSA. They fucking put backdoors in consumer PCs at the chip level, they have 600 million of our photographs, they've been studying cryptography and how to break it for longer than we've been alive. 
it is true that the miners are not decentralized, but are all in huge pools. it wouldn't take much to straight up buy all the bitcoin, if the army diverted their $10B/day spending for one  day, they could literally buy all of it. The US government now owns the biggest crypto wallet outside of satoshi's when they kidnapped Ulbrecht of silk road.
also bitcoin is just a bourgeois investment vehicle now, it has been taken over by the banks. repeated manipulation has transferred most of the wealth of bitcoin back to whales. its over, bitcoin fucking lost.
nobody is building out the revolutionary, state-dismantling, p2p empowering nature of bitcoin. i am disillusioned because i really thought it was crypto-anarchy in a nice package but now i am pretty sure its bullshit and we are gonna have to do violent revolution after all.

NSA made SHA256 and like 4 people own all the mining pools. So decentralizing finance and subverting the state are off the fucking menu.
So what’s left? A more complicated PayPal making a few people rich?

Crypto should not be “without chaos” I fucking hate this whole campaign. Bitcoin was about crypto anarchism. Now banks own it and everyone who is into bitcoin now wants to bend over for the SEC.

Yes of course I hate banks
