Wow I’ve seen a lot of poorly written Bitcoin articles since this summer, but this one is my favorite so far - thanks for this. 
"Claims that cryptocurrencies will replace established fiat currencies are rubbish; our view is that bitcoin is a bubble," the authors argued in their report.”
Sweden, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and Venezuela are all in varying stages of developing their own national cryptocurrencies - I guess Oxford University didn’t have “reading the news on the curriculum. 
“Ms Redwood, in particular, should know a thing or two about currencies, having worked at the Bank of England after studying at Oxford and the University of Warwick.” 
One, depending on where you live, Bitcoin is either considered an asset or a currency- and some jurisdictions are flat out saying “We don’t know” - just a footnote. So Ms.Redwood’s background studying in an Ivy Tower plagued by group-think and maintaining the status quo wants to objectively opine on Bitcoin - a Central Banker’s take on cryptocurrencies... yep this will be an objective assessment...
"Of course, modern paper currencies don't have any intrinsic value either. But unlike dollars, for example, bitcoin is not backed by a credible* authority, such as a central bank or government," the report countered.
This excerpt presented with no comment.. Just read this paragraph over, specifically starting with “bitcoin is not...” and try to see if you can make it to the end without laughing. 
The good news is that, aside from draining the savings of a handful of millennial enthusiasts and wealthy tech speculators, Capital Economics believes the wider fallout will be limited.
At the moment, a bitcoin crash would not have wide economic consequences. Bitcoin's market capitalisation is still small; it is not held by institutions; and it has little correlation with other financial markets," they noted.
1) Ms.Redwood thinks Bitcoin is held by a “handful” of millennials and some wealthy tech speculators... If this woman hasn’t lost all credibility in your eyes yet - just look at the exchange signup numbers (Coinbase ~100k new account sign-ups EVERYDAY, Bittrex closed to new registrants...), if you think a couple of hundred college aged kids represents the majority Bitcoin holders you are woefully misinformed. No institutional ownership? As much as I’d love to go down the list of hedge funds, brokers, and other large investment organizations that own Bitcoin, I’ll give  Ms,Redwood an opportunity to use this new thing all the kids are using called “Google” - probably just a fad and it won’t replace encyclopedias but it’s a start. 
OP; the fact that this article even made you believe this dimwitted woman is a pretty strong signal you really need to up your Bitcoin/overall crypto knowledge, because anyone with an even basic understanding of how Bitcoin works would see through all of the specious arguments, logical fallacies, inconsistencies, and outright wrong statements. Not a jab at you, we all start somewhere and no one can expect someone new to know everything - but articles like this should really raise red flags in your mind. Argument from Authority: I was at the Bank of England so I know more than you. Take it for what it is, it’s garbage, I actually bought more Bitcoin in the middle of typing this because as long as there’s imbeciles like this spreading nonsense for THEIR OWN ENDS (she worked at a central bank dude of course she’s going to try to cast doubt on Bitcoin) that means I get to lower my cost base. When you read an article about Bitcoin ask yourself: Who wrote it? Who do they work for? What are they incentivized to say? Do they have a vested interest in one outcome or another? You can tell me which organization put out a piece on Bitcoin and I bet I can fairly accurately assess the sentiment of it without reading a word just based on who wrote it. Good luck bud

I’ve held BTC since 2012 and this sell-off really forced me to re-evaluate my holdings. I found that it’s never easy to buy when there’s mass panic and the price keeps taking out previous support levels, but it was hard for me to buy more Bitcoin (Cost base aside since I’ve had most of my position for awhile). I went through a mental checklist: 
1) it’s not going anywhere, 2) it’s the future of storing value and transferring it globally, 3) it’s quasi-anonymous, 4) once ‘the populous/businesses’ learn about Bitcoin, it’ll fly higher and never look back. 
This was my out of date investment thesis for Bitcoin, so when the market started dropping and I was looking to take advantage of the price drop it was difficult, for all the above reasons I named originally to myself; 
1) With well over a thousand different cryptocurrencies out now it’s not a foregone conclusion that Bitcoin necessarily will have to remain as a significant player in the cryptocurrency space; first mover advantage can only last so long against coins with superior code bases. 
2) Storing value maybe, I think the wild fluctuations will make it a tough sell for most to store long-term value unless you’re already very wealthy and do not care about how volatile it is, as for processing transaction - the fees are insanely high and the confirmations to clear transactions are slow relative others, the solution to this via SegWit and some batching from Coinbase spamming the mempool will help but still make Bitcoin uncompetitive with Litecoin or Ethereum on a fee basis and on a speed basis it’s no contest. Lightning Network 2-3 years out maybe could help, but 2-3 years in this space is an eternity and Bitcoin risks becoming irrelevant in such an evolving market of other coins. 
3) Bitcoin is not anonymous, it’s address system helps obfuscate identity but if someone or some Government REALLY wanted to track your Bitcoin holdings, they could, especially with all/most Fiat/BTC exchanges under KYC rules. Other privacy coins like Monero do this significantly better. 
4) The populous found out about Bitcoin enmasse in early-mid 2017 and we had our huge rally.. Now we’re selling off, and many newcomers who bought at the high are way under water in their holdings (if they didn’t already panic sell out). Also, Bitcoin was/still is ‘the gateway drug into cryptocurrency’, people learn about Bitcoin and then gravitate toward others in addition to Bitcoin. Once these newcomers ‘get the joke’ (i.e all of the deficiencies I laid out above) they’re going to sell Bitcoin for Ethereum or another coin with a superior and more flexible code base, that’s faster and with lower fees. So, I’m assuming we had our ‘Mom and Pop pump’, now they’re probably underwater and will leave the market, or if they stay, they’ll start to see that there’s much stronger Bitcoin alternatives in the crypto space and sell their Bitcoin. Granted most coins are denominated/pair with BTC - but with a lot of ETH and LTC pairs how long can Bitcoin at least hang it’s hat on that fact? 
I love Bitcoin, I’ve been the weird guy at the party talking to people about it since 2011 and I take no joy in what I wrote above. I own a good amount of Bitcoin, so I have a vested interest in it succeeding and appreciating in value, but given all the above I have to ask: Am I wrong? What am I missing that everyone else in Bitcoin is so bullish on? I’m not being facetious I genuinely would like to hear if this is off-base, in whole or in part.

There are unintended consequences that arise when you try to ban anything outright, which I know that is not what the government in Seoul is saying right now but look at China - they’re just VPNing into exchanges outside of the People’s Republic and still own cryptocurrency. When you ban something all you do is drive it underground and lose the ability to monitor, supervise, and pass responsible but not overly onus regulations. The fact that there is a requirement for Public Officials to disclose their holdings to me is a good sign, because if there were to be an outright ban where for instance you had to liquidate all of your crypto holdings before a certain deadline - why would the government impose a disclosure which I assume would be an ongoing disclosure? I’m just speculating here - but if there was an outright ban declared because ‘crypto is evil, dangerous, ‘dishonest’...whatever’ are you going to tell your entire population just how much of that ‘evil money’ elected officials own/owned right before you condemn it? I may be grasping at straws and I am hopeful that SK eventually just passes regulations instead of Draconian bans but I find it unlikely that a public official disclosure would then be followed by a ban. Just my 174 satoshi...

No worries bro but I appreciate it, I wasn’t trying to be a d*ck, I’m just frustrated because my hands have been tied and I haven’t been able to trade this mass adoption wave I’ve been waiting for since I first bought 5 years ago. 
I’ve had my account with Coinbase since late 2012, about a month ago my e-mail was hacked so as a precautionary measure I notified Coinbase (including all my other financial institutions where I held accounts) to give them a heads up and to monitor accordingly. Coinbase froze the account in late November, after the dust settled and I got all my accounts secured again I reached out to Coinbase to remove the temporary account freeze that I told them to do and now it’s either waiting on Hold for two hours with a generic ‘We’re working on it’ or sending e-mails into oblivion.

Ex-MSer. 
I’m fairly certain this is going to look like an Autocallable Note with short maturity/call and a capped return on both the long and short side:
Max Return of 25% if BTC is over $x on this date
Return of Principle: if BTC is between .95x and .90x
Max Loss of 15% if BTC is below .90x
They’re charging a commission on a simple synthetic collar w/ European options. 
The FAs selling this will probably get 2.5% commission on every dollar and I know they’re going to oversubscribe this in under a week. FAs will push this HARD. 
Good news for awareness but none of these MS clients will actually be touching the spot market so this wouldn’t directly bid up spot BTC.

I’ve hedl Bitcoin since 2012 and like every market, every few months there is a correction, granted this is holiday shopping induced seasonality but when you’ve been trading numerous assets for all long as I have I’ve learned the most profitable trades I’ve made were trades when everyone was petrified and indiscriminately selling, and blood in the streets. I have a significant hodling in Bitcoin and I say bring on the sell-off, I love getting something I was going to buy anyway on the cheap. Not for the faint of heart but it pays to be brave during opportunities like these. Merry Christmas to all the disciplined investors and HODLers.

Unless you’re a controlling shareholder, or hold a significant minority interest and can vote board seats or have a hand in the day to day operations, your share of stock (if it pays no dividends) depends on the presence of a greater fool to bid you out at a profit. 
If I buy one share of GOOGL, I’m not entitled to 1 share’s worth of the square footage of their office space, parking lot... You’re hoping to sell to someone else for more. Only difference is that if the stock of the company you own gets liquidated you get to go to the back of the line of individuals to get paid out of residual earnings(what’s left after paying employee’s salaries, secured bond holders, unsecured bondholders, preferred stockholders, then common stock holders).

No one knows, which is why if you have conviction in Bitcoin or any investment, you buy in scales - If you have $1,000 allocated in your portfolio maybe you buy 25% ‘now’, if it declines by another 5% buy your next 25% tranche, and if it it really declines heavily maybe you commit a higher percentage... Once you run out of capital to invest it’s ‘game over’ for taking advantage of declines. Just my two cents. 
Side Note: Technicals on Bitcoin are very bearish right now and a lot of indicators are implying a retest at around the 6k level. I bought more at 7.8k but I’m in a hodling pattern until we get a clear break higher or dive lower. I wouldn’t mind a dive lower to further ‘de-risk’ the price.

I agree that would help, but I’m thinking for all the people that have no clue what Bitcoin is or lack enough understanding to try it out.

If he thinks this huge BTC downtrend is suddenly going to stop (for..reasons)  and rally 282% in the  last 37 days of 2018 he’s got to lay off that crack pipe.

Most of those orders on the book are spoofed. If the market ever moved remotely close to those “orders” they would immediately be cancelled and resubmitted 1%, 2%, 3% from the current clearing price.

I haven’t either,  I just know that NBC (who is televising the Super Bowl) probably wouldn’t say no a to a pile of money as long as the Ad isn’t in poor taste. 
Makes me think what would a Bitcoin Ad look like? Lol

It’s true and a good point. But if we were to do something like this there would have to be a way to do it that would work in favor of raising awareness of BTC ‘Bitcoin proper’.

You can look at YTD chart of BTC and honestly tell me there is an economic rationale for huge sellers (50-100 lot offers) dumping supply onto thin bids and dollar cost averaging their sale proceeds lower. I’ve owned BTC since 2011 and I’ve seen this market before and after institutions knew it existed, if you don’t think BTC is being manipulated right now you’re fooling yourself. GL

Congrats man, i’m happy for you. From a trading standpoint, I’m waiting for $5.8k before I’m touching this dumpster fire again

Metcalfe’s Law, number of tx, number of unique wallet addresses.. There are fundamentals, they’re not as ‘clean’ as an EV/EBITDA or P/E in Equities but there are plenty of analyses substantiating the explanatory power of these indicators and Bitcoin’s lagged price return. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:08:37
Thx. There’s a good Steem article ‘Bitcoin cartel and the 4th dimension’, explains it all very well with trade data analysis to back it up

$5.8k before we break $8k again. Buy Limit GTC $5,850. Nothing else to do

Bought the dip and sold the rip. Market manipulators are going to start driving the prices down again. Welcome to 2018, where fundamental and technical analysis are out the window and you just try to time the manipulation

I would love for the largest Bitcoin exchanges to ban their customers who are manipulating the price down by dumping into shallow bids and deliberately stop-loss hunting retail hodlers. I would love Bitfinex to grab the cartel of individuals suppressing Bitcoin’s price and ask them ‘What is your economic rationale for dumping onto the market with sell orders to minimize the value of your proceeds?’ There is NONE. I’ve been a HODLer since 2011 and this market will never recover until this cancer is excised from it. 
To any exchanges listening; KNOW YOUR F***ING CUSTOMER AND DON’T LET THEM DESTROY THE ASSET THAT YOUR EXCHANGE WOULD DIE WITHOUT. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:41:38
You don’t think it’s in the exchanges best interests to keep Bitcoin from being artificially dumped? Also, those orders are being executed as Maker orders which means the exchanges aren’t charging these clients a commission so they’re not really their best clients.

I don’t know what pisses me off more, the fact you’re looking to take a loan to recover investment losses or that you put the $ sign after the numerical value

Yes, Bitfinex is going to deposit BCC for BTC hodlers using some esoteric ratio; I’m debating moving some of BTC tp Bitfinex for the fork so I can get my allotment of shitcoin and dump it. Seems like the least pain in the ass way to get the BCC from the fork, I don’t trust my Wireless printer/laptop to create a paper wallet. I know leaving BTC on exchanges is a no-no but I appreciate the ‘simplicity value’ of it. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:53:09
Confused myself, i see SegWit2x at 87.3% (scary) and BIP91 at around 14%? Me thinks I’m not reading the same page as everyone else

I can’t speak to some all-powerful Illuminati trying to destroy Bitcoin. But there was a good article (I’ll try to find it or if someone knows what I’m talking about and can post a link) there is/are large sellers that are systematically overloading the market with supply everytime we run up THEN waiting for a little stabilization and then dumping supply back onto the market at a LOWER PRICE than the previous dumping. Then it’s rinse and repeat. This is not the action of a rational investor concerned about maximizing their investment return, this is a group of individuals whose sole purpose (IMO) is to overwhelm the market with supply and move the price lower and to stamp out any recovery with an onslaught of more supply. I worked with large institutional trading desks and NO ONE would ever execute a trade on an open position that would drop the price by 5,10,15% while there was still shares to sold - that’s BAD trading and anyone who did that would be fired so quick their head would spin. 
This is blatant manipulation of the market and frankly exchanges need to step in and evaluate their customers’ trading activity. No regulators will do this like they do in the stock market so exchanges need to investigate these individual’s rationale for why they did what they did. If you had 500 BTC to sell and the there were only 5 BTC available on the bid side, would you put 50 BTC up and overwhelm the buy orders to drop the price or would you layer into the market i.e matching up to the buy side to keep your sell price and therefore your profits stable? Anyone who can manage to hodl 500 BTC or more I would assume has a basic understanding on how supply and demand work, this isn’t incompetence, this is methodological and carefully orchestrated market manipulation. This drop is NOT about fundamentals, it’s a exercise in disenchanting HODLers and discouraging new-comers and adopters. If we truly want to do something about this, we need to start voicing our concerns to the exchanges. Until then it’s just rinse and repeat with everyone running around in circles trying to correlate a logical economic rationale to BTC’s price action where frankly THERE IS NONE.
