You do not need to remember full sentences. If there will be enough unique lines you will just need to remember "picture" like "there was a tiger". I'll think about tools to recovery wallet from seed in random order. It's 24! combinations, but still better than 2048^24

This is only reasonable if you have safe places to hide your seed and its copy. 
It's always better to have one option more to secure your money.

On the website you have "It's extra security, not replacement for the paper (or similar) version!". If someone is trying to remember his/her 24-words (for any reason) it's a lot easier to use poems (stories, associations, rhymes) vs random words

Write them down, read, remember. Repeat after month. 
I remember some poems from school after 10 years.  
It's pointless in this case to write poem down if you don't want to remember it.

I don't understand your question. 24-word recovery seed contains random words and this site has goal to help you to remember them. You do not show your words anybody. 
And the most important thing: this site isn't ready. We need to have 2048 great poems before we'll say that it's really useful

And? :) 
When all 2048 poems will be ready we'll show instruction how to use it, but it's very simple so i write it here:
1. Open all 2048 poems
2. Do not click/select any of it. 
3. Write on a paper the one that matches your 24-words but DO NOT CLICK/SELECT YOUR CORRECT WORDS ONLINE

In fact, this site is about WHY you should invest in Bitcoin, but you must pay attention to details
