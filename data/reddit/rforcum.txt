That sounds exactly like something our fucked up government would do!

Yeah same things been happening to me.

ok well I sent yall 240$ on March 5th. I still don't have my bitcoins. Bitinstant didn't even send me a confirmation email or order ID. Zip Zap confirmed the transfer (my account # is 606793743). I have used "live chat" and emailed your company for the past month and i have yet to be given any information about my order. No order ID, no ETA, only false assurance that my request had been forwarded to tech support and would be processed within the next business day. Can you help me?

I erase my browser history so I don't have that. However, my zip zap account # is 606793743, my bitcoin address is 1HhrdsHJhjVG4aph2vFu4x1g9ENMBXeXxm, and my email is forcumr

Also Zip Zap confirmed my transfer. account # 606793743

I agree. Also according to other people whose orders were delayed, when they finally got their bitcoins, they were missing around 30$ from what they payed for with no explanation. Bitinstant used a rate of like 214$ for a bitcoin. Ive had a good experience with Bitinstant in the past too but this is bullshit

I did not mess up my order and neither did the other countless users who are having problems. I have used Bitinstant flawlessly in the past but it seems that the increased pressure has reduced their system to shit. The real shame is that Bitinstant has not notified anyone and is still claiming that orders are consistently processed in an hour. Which is a lie and therefore false advertising.

I payed $250 dollars to bitinstant on March 6 and I still do not have my money. They didn't even give me an order ID. Zip Zap confirmed that I my transaction was completed. My Zip Zap account # 606793743
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:10:29
I can't use the support link because y'all never sent me a confirmation email with my order id. What should I do?
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:09:23
Could you please help with my order then? It is wayyy overdue
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:57:12
I payed for 240$ of bitcoins to be sent to my bitcoin address on march 6. At that time the price of bitcoins was about 40$. I still have not received my bitcoins and it has been **OVER A MONTH**!! I only hope that when bitinstant finally gets there shit together and sends me my bitcoins I get the 6 bitcoins I paid for and not the 1.2 bitcoins that 240$ dollars is worth now. That is a 4.8btc difference (about 1000$). I have been a regular bitinstant user for a year now and they were trustworthy until this incident. I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING BITINSTANT. 
PS. they never gave me an order ID but zip zap confirmed the transfer.

I will update if I receive my bitcoins on whether they ripped me off or not!
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:37:54
That was smart to save the confirmation page! Have they responded to any of your emails?
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:23:08
I did not get my funds and it has been a day. Will you give my order another manual push? Also Idk what a "push" is but y'all need to try something different. My order is 43 days late and it has been "pushed" many times (according to your people) and obviously its not working very well. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:14:48
You know how to use bitinstant. That doesn't mean you know how it works. If Zip Zap confirmed my order then bitinstant got my money...simple as that. I obviously know that they usually give you an order id in a confirmation email when you use their service (if you read my post). This time they messed up and didn't send one. Don't give advice when you don't know what you're talking about

Can you help me?

We all know whats going on here....
Bitinstant is overflowing with orders. Instead of taking their service offline and pushing all the overdue orders through like they should (their website claims the service takes a maximum of 24hrs), they are taking as many orders as possible to make MORE MONEY. Also they pretty much make up whatever they want for the price of a bitcoin. So they are making a killer profit on each order by using a bullshit rate. **We should start a class-action lawsuit against this company**. What they are doing is illegal!
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:32:14
It's funny how they never respond after I say that
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:46:34
I don't think you understant how it works. I sent my money to ZIP ZAP on March 5th. Zip Zap is the service that send the money to bitinstant . They confirmed that my transfer was successful so obviously my money did not go to some random place. Bitinstant fucked up my order and that is why I have no received a confirmation email.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:21:36
yes all the people who are having problems all used fake IDs. you are stupid and that was sarcastic

I payed 240$ for bitcoins on **March 6**. At that time the price of bitcoins was about 40$. I still have not received my bitcoins and it has been OVER A MONTH!! I paid for 6 bitcoins and I will probably receive 1.2 bitcoins that 240$ dollars is worth now (if I get them). That is a 4.8btc difference (about 1000$). Thanks for costing me 1000$ **I still don't have my bitcoins!!**
