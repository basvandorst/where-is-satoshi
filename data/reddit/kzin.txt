I spent it on subs. Same result.

The prices on quarters ($55) look too good to be true also.

Thanks for the laugh. This thread was starting to freak me out.

Nice. I love my 970.

Let me quote Steve Gibson. This applies to symetric keys, but I believe the brute force approach would be as long for asymetric public keys.
" A couple weeks ago, might have been last week, when we did a Q&amp;A, Leo, I read a question that had some fun math in it. And this was a guy who decided to see how long it would take to crack 256-bit symmetric encryption. And reading from the transcript of the podcast, we said, "So let's say the tricky government" - and this is reading his question. His question was, paraphrasing, so let's say the tricky government has a secret algorithm that somehow allows them to weaken the strength of brute-forcing a 256-bit symmetric encryption key to one-trillionth of the original strength. So we're just going to imagine that there's some way that the government has to do that. And let's say they had a computer that can try one hundred trillion guesses per second. And let's say this computer was one cubic millimeter in size. And let's say they build a cracking complex the size of the entire Earth, made out of these one cubic millimeter crypto-cracking computers. And he says, in his question, he said, "If I did my math right, it would still take 34 trillion years to crack." And he says, "I like that." And so I think that might have been you, Leo, reading the question, saying "I like that." I responded, "I like that, too." And then Leo, you said, "Did you check his math?" Well, I didn't. But Jason Bache, who has a website, JasonBache.com, did the math. He tweeted me. He's  and it's also NerdsLimited.com is his site. He sat down with a copy of MatLab, did the math. And get this, Leo: 33.8802 trillion years. LEO: That's right on. STEVE: So our original questioner was right, 34 trillion years. But if we want to get a little more precise, 33.8802 trillion years. LEO: It's a rounding error. STEVE: But again, that really helps to put into perspective that, I mean, we've made a series of assumptions which are worst, worst, worst, worst, worst case, that there's a way of doing it in a trillionth of the original. We just threw away that many bits, essentially, from the key. And that it's going to do a hundred trillion guesses per second, which would be really impressive; and that it's a millimeter cube in size; and that we have an Earth-size worth of them. Given all that - and I don't know how we'd power it or cool it, of course, those little details. But still, 34 trillion years to crack. So 256-bit symmetric encryption looks like it's good to go, given that the only attack we know on it is brute force. "

I snagged 6.5 while they were down at 71. Tee hee this is fun.
