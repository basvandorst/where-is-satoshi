my family owns delis and small convenience markets. We have a constant stream of customers coming in and no room for lag time. thankfully credit card payments are quicker then they once were. I wanted to set them up to accept btc and some of the problems we faced were the confirmation times and the fact that no one in our general area knows about btc. this was a year ago and i bet if i helped them set up a merchant account to accept bitcoin today, we would make a few sells here and there but its something they dont have room to take on and manage just yet. now bitcoin atms on the other hand.... ;)

i agree with you I wrote an easy-to-read/understand guide directed towards brick and mortar stores on how the implementation of bitcoin could benefit business but quickly realized that the 10 min confirmation becomes an immediate problem. My focus now turns to the next best niche, in my opinion, for public adoption being any subscription service. think about all the automatic bills you already have. Business' could essentially offer a discount for paying with bitcoin that is set on auto pay, obviously. The business will be saving LOADS on transaction fees a month and the customer is happy that they are getting a discount. If, all of a sudden, most your service providers began excepting bitcoin, and it brought your bill down to pay with this 'fancy new currency,' then i bet a lot more people would at least look into bitcoin to get an idea of what its about..
