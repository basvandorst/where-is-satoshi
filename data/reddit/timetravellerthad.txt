That's if you are looking for a single address. Don't the odds drop when you look for ANY key?

I just found out what a repeater is. I can assure you I exist. I am not code.

That's frightening. I don't doubt the gov would want to do this, legal or not. I hope you're wrong. If it really is technically feasible, my guess is that it would backfire and have massive unintended consequences. I hope so anyway.

A drug that causes people to go on murder-sprees is called a poison. Poisons are mostly already legal.

I didn't put that too well. There isn't an actual drug that causes a literal murder spree, but plenty of poisons can cause insanity - mercury, lead.
