Well, I don't think wired is the only reason for the spike. You had some major news outlets, like The Wall Street Journal and CBS, that came out at the same time or before. Hell, my stock broker (who advised me against investing in BTC two months ago,) saw the WSJ story and called me immediately to find out how he could get in on that 200,000% increase in the currency. Want to know why t went up so much the last few days? Ask your stock broker... They know about it now and have money to invest.

if Liberty Reserve is the downside, then why is everyone still using MtGox?

Looking at the trade data over the last week, I noticed a lot of large purchases of 1000 coins or more. Snce you can't really use bit coin for much just yet, I would predict that someone is going to want to sell soon... Thus bringing down the price. 
That is, unless they know something I dont... Maybe poker sites are buying them.  If that is what is happening, then it's still going to go up!

current difficulty is 157426.
Estimated difficulty is 227315 in 579 blocks. Using current computing power, the change will go in effect in 59 hours at 6:20 AM GMT 5/19... but the computing power keeps rising, so expect it to occur in less than two days.

I cant tell if your being sarcastic or if you're just unaware.  
As someone who works for an SMSC, i can absolutely say that we charge for MT messages (Mobile Terminated) dependent on where the SMS message was terminated.
