This is only true if everyone owns on average 1 btc.

Might try them out, how long did it take for your account to get verified? My verification is "processing."

Well thought out and I pretty much agree. At first I thought maybe it was too close to bit coins and there might be some confusion between bits and bit coins but I think it would be ok. Another option would be something completely different a la dollars and cents. Bitcoins and hippopotamus or something completely not confuseable.

I thought the overall goal of btc was to integrate into the general economy and get people who aren't tech-savvy on board? I just think if everyone is trying to make a big push towards being forward thinking this physical wallet is not the symbol we need right now. I agree though, the price (which is ridiculous at the moment) and functionality are crucial.

I listen to quite a few of your releases, keep it up guys.

Yep, I'm still surviving off of the few cents you get for free with "try bit coin" or whatever. Waiting for my bank info/registration to clear while I watch my 1c jump to 2c. I told my gf about it. She wasn't as excited as I hoped.

Crash =/= return to mean in my book. I agree that it won't grow exponentially forever.

Totally agree. Great that these are getting put out there but that thing looks terrible from a product design point of view. It's like a cross between a cheap car alarm controller and a diabetes tester. And that interface. Fuck. If one of the goals is to attract laymen then ditch the command line-looking interface, jesus this isn't 1992. They desperately need some more competition. Goddamn Tamagotchi prototype or currency of the future? I can't tell.

This is assuming it is just going to increase onward towards infinity forever.

Yeah I really don't like the argument that because it increased greatly it means it is definitely going to crash. I get that a large increase typically is followed but some sort of adjustment or return to a normal state but the level of integration into the regular economy is growing, albeit at a slower rate than the price is raising. But the level of fear mongering is ridiculous. People saying "oh shit, here we go, you ready guys, its going down" after it drops 50 points is just stupid. I know, everyone wants to call the crash before it happens but all this negative hype is just as bad as all the "to the moon" type of stuff. It may crash pretty low, it may not. We all have our opinions on that.
