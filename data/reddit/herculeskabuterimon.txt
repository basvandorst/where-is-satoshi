Man you're living the dream for me. That's my goal basically. Not enough to retire, not enough to buy a lambo or a yacht. But enough to pay off my student loans, and maybe make a down payment on a house. 
I only got into crypto this year so it'll be a long ass time for me, but I'm glad to hear someone got their goal accomplished.

I did my first purchase on coin base about a month ago and it took me about 2 hours or so for it to go through. Granted it wasn't a huge amount of money so maybe that matters.

Haha same. I really really really thought about it in 2011 when I had like an extra 10K because of an inheritance and a couple other things. But I passed. I wouldn't have bought in and ran servers etc etc, but I probably would have bought a couple hundred dollars worth. Then in 2013 some roommates and I were pretty close to doing it, but we backed out for various reasons. After that Gox happened and I was kinda glad we didn't, because I know we would have gotten boned there.
Then when it hit 1k I was like damn that's super cool. go BTC. Then finally after the fork I bought in. Way too late for a massive profit, but in a few years I'm sure the amount I'm in now will be a fair amount to help me buy whatever I need at the time, and if it doesn't oh well.

I mean if I had $13 million just chilling and generally gaining money I'd be fine with that too. I'd probably have cashed out $3 million worth, but I can't blame him for just seeing if it can hit 10K.

I try to do a weekly buy in on friday or Saturday around 10-20 bucks or so. Why? Because it likes to crash every weekend since I've started basically two months ago. I get a little more bang for my buck.

I have to say this works pretty well for me on small purchases. Right now I'm just putting in an extra five bucks a week towards it. Nothing big obviously, but that's pretty much a fast food meal, cup of coffee, movie rental, etc. to someone. 
For me lately it's been do I want to get this game at 30 right now? or wait another month and get it when it's 20 and throw that extra ten into btc. Granted I only got it recently, but it still works for me given the massive rise lately in the coin.

I couldn't agree more. It's not a problem that has to be fixed right now, but it does need to be fixed sooner rather than later.
