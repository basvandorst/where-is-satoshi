I'm a bit astonished at the comments from yesterdays daily discussion. Granted I'm only in this since july, but how come volatility is usually regarded as normal but as soon as the price drops a bit more, so many people freak out?

May I ask where you set the autobuy? I started with Coinbase, but I can't find an auto purchase function on GDAX (and I don't wanna pay the Coinbase fees of course).

I have a few questions regarding addresses:
- After googling a bit, I've come to the conclusion that using only one address is not safe / recommended, but as long as you don't spend from that address and only receive, it shouldn't be a problem, is that correct? So if I dca say from Coinbase Pro to my hardware wallet, can I safely use the same recipient address each time?
- Also, I bought some bitcoin for a friend (I will set him up with a hardware wallet too, but right now, his bitcoin are on mine (we trust each other and have known each other for more than 12 years). So when I will go about sending him his bitcoin once he has the hardware wallet, do I move that amount of bitcoin to a different address first and only then send it? Or do I just send it and then use a different address when I buy (/receive) the next time?
Thanks for all the inputs, I really appreciate this community, it's been a lot of fun getting into bitcoin!

Wait so it's cheaper and faster than Coinbase pro?

So, I just got on the bitcoin train 2 weeks ago, and I plan on dollar cost averaging (buying monthly) and hodling. My question is, since the price is pretty low (I bought in higher), should I buy more right now or just wait till the end of the month when I wanted to do my first dca payment?

So you're saying he should trust strangers on the internet after all?
