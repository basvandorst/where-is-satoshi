You severely overestimate the amount of people who know about bitcoin.

Throwing away a cash cow that brings in as much in fees as gox did is stupid no matter your wealth.

Sure, if he was younger and not reclusive that might have weight but I find it easy to believe he has never heard of it.

A huge part of dogecoin is the tipping culture though, why omit it?

Yeah, blame the people critical of the incompetence, not the idiots who can't work out how to fix their screwups and stay in business at the same time.

Why would we want to fund lobbyists or pour money into Washington? For a global currency, wasting time and money with US beauracracy might be worthwhile in some ways but ultimately our intrests will be better served by sidestepping this and focusing on adoption directly, through promotion, partnerships and development as you mentioned. Why tangle ourselves in red tape when we are uniqely suited to bypass it completely?

I liked this comment, " It sounds like Mt.Gox was being run like a 5 year old's lemonade stand."
Though it's a little insulting to 5 year olds.

Your countries legal system is easy to hate though.

His mismanagement of a multi-million dollar business wasn't stupid enough for you? Personally programming in PHP for a secure financial project is enough for me to think he's extremely stupid.

He could sell or give away the wallet and keys, bitcoins don't move but ownership does.

Forget his ordering hits, and contemplate his running of an organisation where you can order hits. Life seems appropriate.

Fiat is worth zero by default. To give it value you need to put in effort. With zero effort it will naturally be worth zero.

Worth what exactly?

Sure, but they couldn't lend out 900% of their holdings.

And when everyone says BTC your imaginary funds are screwed.
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:23:06
That's his point. How are you going to do that with crypto?
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:11:02
They can't lend out coins they don't have.
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:29:39
Right. They would need to use or create a fiat currency. They would be unable to operate purely with a single crypto like bitcoin.

Secrecy isn't good or evil, it can be entirely pragmatic ie. keeping your private key safe. Yet it is routinely used to conceal evil.

I'd call it wise to keep a distance and avoid any perceived conflict of interest until they were on legally sound footing.
