I've been thinking about this myself. I think the closest thing might be if governments decide to phase out their fiat and replace it with gold backed crypto. Not sure if this is possible though with the amount of debt they have but supposedly Russia is working on it?

When it comes to stocks the "FIRE" (Financially Independent Retired Early) community follow the 4% rule. Basically they believe once they have 25x their annual expenses invested in index funds they can withdraw 4% per year to live off.
I think it will be possible to do something similar with Bitcoin in the future we just don't have enough historical data yet to know what the numbers would be.

He seems to think the cost of mining is unsustainable over the long term and the only way the system works is if the price keeps going up. Currently it costs 5% of the market cap annually to maintain the network.
I don't see the issue though? In the bear market the miners running on tight margins or at a loss just shut down their miners and difficulty adjusts. Does this put the network at risk with the drop in hash rate or something?

You can tell they're confused with what to do with it because of all the bans/unbans. On one hand it's extremely profitable for them but on the other they don't like not having full control over it.
My guess is they'll want to embrace certain aspects and restrict others. I think they want Bitcoin as a commodity but not a currency. They'll use it themselves to get around sanctions, grow their holdings, encourage investment in blockchain businesses and mining industry to bring money into the country but they won't let their citizens use it as a currency.

@_date: 2019-11-17 12:14:28
Trying to time the market to increase your stack is tempting. Especially with bitcoins 4 year cycle. But the more I think about it the more I'm content with the DCA strategy. If I do try anything I might scale out 20% of my stack in late 2021 if its going parabolic then set limit buy orders at -70%, -75%, -80% etc of the peak.

My prediction is countries will build their own digital currencies and use Bitcoin as a reserve commodity like Gold pre 1971.

I think something is wrong with me.
Price goes down I'm happy my fiat buys more.
Price goes up I'm happy my Bitcoin is worth more.
Price goes sideways I'm happy I can buy more before it goes up lol.

One day you'll realise that Bitcoin is undervalued today.

@_date: 2019-10-31 23:16:47
A hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor is a good investment for anyone that holds more than a few hundred dollars in Bitcoin. Your private key is never exposed to the internet or a computer. I would also recommend something like cryptosteel to store your seed phrase to recover your funds.
@_date: 2019-08-23 02:38:12

1. We will fork to a quantum resistant algorithm before then.
2. There is no good alternative to bitcoin that exists unless we go back to the gold standard which I think is highly unlikely.
3. People will remain apathetic until they need it like people in Venezuela and Hong Kong right now. Westerners will be last for mass adoption IMO.

Don't own one but I've seen this question answered. The node still gets updates and works after the subscription ends. But if your using their 2 of 3 multisig wallet and need to recover your funds with the key casa holds you have to pay a 0.01% or 0.1%? fee of the value of funds recovered.

I see what you're saying. Less selling pressure on the market from miners rewards. But wouldn't big miners sell OTC to not affect the price?

My gaming pc with a 2080ti makes about $1.50 a day mining alt coins on nicehash but pays out in BTC. It's totally not worth it but I guess if you have free power and a decent GPU why not lol

I think dollar cost averaging 10% of income is a good amount to start with.

I used to use BTCMarkets but recently switched to Independent Reserve for their auto buy feature and slightly lower fees. Can send funds from my NAB account to them instantly using PayID and it purchases BTC automatically. Great for easy dollar cost averaging.

According to dcabtc.com if you would have bought $280/month for the last 2yrs (no 18 month option) you would now have 1 BTC with $6720 invested. Pretty good average price considering 2 years ago was the peak of the bull run lol.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:59:39
Sorry I don't know of one, but it would be very interesting.

Historically, the best time to accumulate has been when Bitcoin is below the 2 year moving average. We've just dipped below it.

I respect what they are doing but it's too risky for me. 6.2% annual interest with the risk of losing it when bitcoin can move more than that in a single day doesn't seem worth it to me.

@_date: 2019-09-25 00:06:08
Never, will just spend the interest when there's a safe &amp; decentralized way to earn it.

I've been tempted to try BlockFI, Celcius or Crypto.com for a while but I always chicken out.
"Not your keys, Not your coins" in the back of my head lol.
Will there ever be a way to earn interest on our BTC in the future while keeping our private keys?

Has rental income kept up with inflation? If you owned a house and had a tenant could you survive easily?

Bad time to sell. Will be alot higher in December IMO.

If you know who he is can't you just report it to the police?

Isn't Chainlink trying to solve this?

This is why I don't do combined finances lol
@_date: 2019-09-12 11:01:52
I'd rather put it all on black

Bitcoin gets a lot of hate on the Cryptocurrency sub aswell.

I tried but they wouldn't lend for a "high risk investment"
Only cars, holidays, debt refinance etc :/

I'll need to see your proof of poo.

Also heard in Andreas' latest video he cancelled his trip down under due to new laws stating the government can force you to give them your passwords for all electronic devices or face 5 years jail.

Lost my private keys in a boating accident.

I've been unsuccessful at convincing any friends or family to buy bitcoin. Even the ones with heavy shitcoin bags :(

He means never type the private key into a device with an internet connection. Use a hardware wallet to spend it or write the key on something like cryptosteel for storage. 5 BTC is quite alot you'll now be inboxed by scammers. Be careful.

To the futures!

Just means less consumerism for useless crap. High value products and services will still be purchased.

Bitcoin is software so I think a software comparison makes sense.
What about the DOS operating system?
Although I think it's more like Linux lol :)
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:18:57
Is this what you learnt in school?
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:38:53
You mean buy more right?

Yep, just like whales accumulating OTC because they don't want to push the price up. IMO its just a matter of time until word gets out then it's fomo time lol.
