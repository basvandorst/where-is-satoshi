Just because something is a illegal in china doesn't mean people won't do it.

I have no problems with the posts bringing up actual concerns and issues. What I don't like are the spam comments that only say negative things "bitcoin is in its death spiral, sell now!" and don't respond to comments with anything but "doesn't matter because [link to anti bitcoin site]."  
They come off as bots to me, they never have actual conversations, just repeating propaganda and spreading FUD. 
I don't think bitcoin will be  forever and it's only a part of my portfolio, but that doesn't stop me from spotting an obvious FUD campaign. 
I encourage actual discussion of the problems. I discourage mindless "BTC DED KEK" comments.

Bcash is easier to say. Lazier pronunciations almost always win. 
That's why Bitcoin &gt; Bitcoin Core and Ccash &gt; Bitcoin Cash.

It's happening soon, I believe coinbase will hand it out in Jan 2018?

There definitely are issues, and personally I don't believe bitcoin will remain  forever, but the way these people post is very suspicious. They repeatedly post negative statements without direct accusations. Such as "bitcoin is dying" instead of "bitcoin has fees that are way too high." They don't respond to any disagreeing posts except to say "lol wrong" attempt to change the subject.
Of course there are real users with real concerns, but they act differently. Like.. real people, and not FUD bots.

Unfortunately that word already has a common meaning

The bitcoin attacks methods really remind me of the info wars going on in US politics right now. 
They immediately attack anybody that isn't on their side (even when they aren't bitcoin supporters), they make vague claims and pretty much only post negative things. They also don't directly respond to criticism, they always attempt to change the subject. 
I find it very interesting.

I like bcash more than bitcoin in many ways, but I dislike how aggressively they attack others. I've been called a "core idiot" so many times which is hilarious because I'm totally an altcoiner. I hold mostly ARK, NEO, Ethereum, and Litecoin. But if I don't agree with them then it's "DAMN CORE TROLL".
