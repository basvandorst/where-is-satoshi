By default, Samourai has some settings that add to privacy but increase transaction size almost back to the size of a non-segwit transaction. I discovered this myself after using it for a few days &amp; wondering why the fees were not any lower. From Samourai's [blog]( Titled *Configure your wallet for lowest transaction fees*:
* Step 1 - Open Settings
Tap the three vertical dots on the top right of the toolbar and then tap Settings. This will launch the wallet settings screen, where all configuration will take place. 
* Step 2 - Disable like-typed outputs
From the main Settings screen tap the Transactions option. Disable the Receive change to like-typed outputs option by removing the checkmark from the checkbox. Like-typed outputs is a Samourai feature that improves your privacy on the blockchain.
* Step 3 - Disable BIP126
From the Transactions settings screen Disable the Spend using BIP 126 option by removing the checkmark from the checkbox. Disabling BIP126 will result in much smaller transactions at the loss of blockchain privacy. 
* Step 4 - Enable RBF
From the Transactions settings screen Enable the Spend using RBF option by adding a checkmark to the checkbox. Enabling RBF will allow you to later top-up low transaction fees.

That's not what I meant, although now I realize this was op's metric for calculation. I was thinking of the current supply only as well as analysis of the blockchain to see how many coins you would need to be in the top million wallet balances, top 500k wallet balances, etc. I also just realized that # of adresses doesn't = # of people as well as the fact that very few people keep their whole balance in one address &amp; we don't know how many balances are lost/unretrievable. So basically ignore my original curiosity altogether, impossible to determine. LOL

I really do hope your bank can do something but I do think these replies might be giving you false hope, Especially if it was a fraudulent check. There is a reason only a small percentage of sellers on lbc consistently turn a profit. We have developed the habits, tools &amp; strict operational procedures that mitigate the high risks of scams. Any successful seller follows a no exceptions rule when accepting cash deposits, check your online balance to be sure the funds show in your "Available Balance", not just in pending transactions, regardless of what the receipt says. This is the only way to be sure the deposit was cash, as anything other than cash will show only a portion of the deposit in the available balance. It's a hard way to learn this lesson but an all too common one. 
Another thing most successful sellers know is not to even approach the bank about recovering the funds, we just have to eat it. The reason is because as soon as you open up an inquiry &amp; the bank starts asking questions, you have only two options, neither of them good. 1 is you fess up to selling bitcoins which will almost without fail get your account closed by the bank. 2 is lie about the source of the activity &amp; hope you recover the money, in which case if they do any further digging &amp; find out the truth you've now just committed a felony.

@_date: 2018-05-07 17:32:34
Unless your goal is to make more btc rather than more USD. In which case you lose in a bull market &amp; only win in a bear market. The reason is because if I'm charging 10% above spot I'm really only clearing a few % after overhead &amp; taxes. Since it can easily take a week to convert my incoming cash back to BTC, all the market has to move is a few % upward to cause me to take a loss on the trade. Again this is only a problem if your end game is to make more btc rather than usd. A sustained bull run can crush a localbitcoins trader or atm operator.

I do agree with you on that, it SEEMS pretty clear cut to me also. However, Naked-Emperor's link as well as many attorneys that have weighed in to the contrary also seem pretty clear cut. I would tend to lean towards FinCEN's letter in Naked-Emperor's link as the precedent.


"Investigators reportedly set their sights on Espinoza and Reid after coming across their profiles on localbitcoins.com,…" - from the article.
Yes I'm well aware of that case. It is a charge that has never been tested in court so until the outcome of that case we don't know if Florida courts will rule sellers as transmitters. A charge is only that, a charge. It does not define law or set precedent. The charges for agreeing to sell even after being told the bitcoins would be used for illegal purposes are a lot stronger &amp; will probably hold up if the guys take it that far instead of pleading out.

The guys in Florida got busted because the undercover buyer stated he would be buying drugs online with the Bitcoin &amp; the seller still sold it to them. Selling bitcoin in any amount is not inherently illegal, but it is if you know the buyer is using it for illegal activities. At least, according to the charges. It hasn't been tested in court yet so there is no precedent.

You're not thinking of the cost of mining for the miner. I bought $5k in mining equipment &amp; last month my bill for electricity on those miners was $840. They barely made more than that with the current exchange rate. I don't expect to make a solid USD return unless or until the value gets back up significantly. In which case it still would've probably been more profitable to buy $5k in bitcoin from the beginning.

The intrinsic value of Bitcoin the currency can be debated, I'll give you that. But bitcoin the protocol has unquestionable utility. Most people don't even know that there are 2 bitcoins, the protocol &amp; the currency. The currency could fail but the protocol is the most exciting part. This isn't a perfect example but think of it this way: AOL ultimately crashed &amp; burned but the protocol it used, the internet (tcp/ip), survived.

Depending if you calculate your return in BTC or USD, the answer is very feasibly "forever". Although it can't be calculated because the difficulty is unpredictable. If the difficulty flattens out then your miners can continue to be profitable. If it continues upward, which it has consistently, then your return continues to diminish.
Example (using btc as the denomination): I buy a mining rig for 1 BTC. That rig generates 0.1 BTC per month in month one, 0.09 in month 2, 0.08 in month 3, etc. When you factor in electricity it could very well never return a profit.

Incorrect, Bitcoin is instantaneous as well. What do you think, the merchant makes the customer stand there waiting around for confirmations? No, they let you check out as soon as they see the transaction has been broadcast, which is instantaneous, and they take the very tiny risk (much less than the risk of a chargeback) that there won't be a double spend. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:16:41
You're still fixating on the consumer retail aspect. Although I don't think any of us mind the thought of potentially lower prices, it's not what has people excited for Bitcoin's potential.

Adoption, more people buying than selling. 


No, in the end this is still just a grand experiment with no guarantee of long term success. 


Positive sentiment about Bitcoin stems from analysis of its fundamentals. Being open source so that anyone can audit the code plays a large role in that as well. 


Being skeptical is the correct initial reaction so you're on the right path. Do your own research &amp; pose tough questions as you're already doing. If you do not find satisfactory answers to your criticisms/concerns, then do not buy bitcoin. If you do, then buy bitcoin. 


Theoretically, yes. However, because of the enormous financial incentive for finding an exploit or hack, Bitcoin has been under attack 24/7 for most of its existence. And in fact there have been bugs &amp; exploits found &amp; patched over the years. Some bigger than others, but none material enough to the function of bitcoin to bring it down. That's quite a track record. There is no such thing as 100% security in any software or technology, but bitcoin certainly ranks up there as one of the most sound &amp; resilient the world has ever seen.

Network effects like Facebook are hard to achieve. It's a chicken &amp; egg problem. Merchants don't wanna get set up to accept it if they think there won't be many people paying with it, and consumers are less likely to buy any if there aren't many merchants who accept it. However, it's important to note that 1st world consumer use is not where bitcoin has its greatest opportunity to shine. As Andreas likes to point out "if you're looking at Bitcoin as just a better 1st world payment solution, you're missing the point". Bitcoin could fail too see massive consumer adoption &amp; still be wildly successful as any of a number of other utilities such as remittances, settlement processing or as a store of value like gold.

Losing out to another crypto currency is one possible outcome but there are others. Some with lower likelihood than others but all are plausible. A few, but certainly not the only, possibilities are:
-A fatal flaw or exploit in the code discovered by hackers
-Governments banning or regulating it so heavily not destroying it but perhaps driving it underground (think file-sharing) &amp; preventing it from reaching its full price potential
-Failure to reach widescale adoption
All investments have risks. Think of it not so much as a catch but as elements of Bitcoin's risk profile.

It's a common misconception that there is a "winner" &amp; a "loser" in a trade. Free market economics correctly disputes this by acknowledging that in a purely voluntary exchange both parties benefit. Paying for something in Bitcoin does not send a signal to the merchant that you don't value bitcoin at all. It simply states that you value the amount of the good being offered more than the amount in Bitcoin being charged for it. That's it. This is very simple market economics here.

Haha, one of the reasons for re-branding. Although so many ppl know me as West Side Bitcoins, it sounds like gangsters. When I created the West side bitcoins name in 2013 it was on localbitcoins with no anticipation of what this hobby would turn into. Now I have 15+ bitcoin Atm's across multiple states &amp; I'm well overdue for a re-branding to something more appropriate. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 02:53:15
There are so many things in this post that are absurd but one fundamental flaw sticks out the most as laughable. Let's say you could predict bitcoins "highest". If so, why would you only sell half at that point, and not all 100? I mean, if it was indeed at it's highest and you in fact knew so, wouldn't that by definition mean that any coins you kept could only go down in value. Never again to be as valuable as they were at the "highest"?
@_date: 2015-09-23 02:53:00
Agreed. I have been frustrated by lack of support for this and haven't found a single app with this functionality that seems pretty simple.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:07:18
I think this is a fair argument. I think because I already pay such a massive amount of capital gains being a localbitcoins seller I wasn't thinking of the implications for the average user. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:06:36
That app does not allow you to set a markup percentage. It only converts at the current spot price.

The answer is consolidation &amp; convenience. I can take a selfie with a Polaroid camera, make copies of the photo &amp; drive to all of my friends &amp; family's homes to drop a copy off on their doorstep, but why do I use a smartphone &amp; Facebook/twitter/Instagram to distribute it instead? Because they present a consolidated &amp; convenient experience to achieve the same end in fewer steps. That's what this app aims to do for wagering between friends. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:51:37
Correction. Over 1 year = long term capital gains. Under 1 year = short term capital gains. There is no scenario in which you would pay income tax for selling bitcoin (in the U.S.)

I love the potential of this app. I sell Bitcoins &amp; I've had an awful time trying to onboard my friends. Mostly I just get made fun of with the "oh God, here comes the bitcoin pitch". So, check this out. I just hit my group of friends up in our ongoing group chat &amp; am trying to pimp this. We are a group of betting degenerates. We play poker, we do fantasy football, and in the latest case one of us is having a baby &amp; the sex, birth date, weight, over/unders are already being smack talked &amp; wagered on. A centralized place for us to do all this benefits all of us &amp; using bitcoin benefits ME &amp; my cause for convincing others to use bitcoin. I am really hoping this app has a future. I also recently launched a btc related app, although it doesn't have this larger potential. It's more niche, but as a local trader I couldn't find a single calculator app that let me add my % markup fee as a btc seller so I built it myself:  No intention of hijacking the thread, just sharing my 1st time developer story. I'm truly excited for your app!

I will modify my answer. Selling bitcoin with a markup on occasion does not require registration. Guidance from FinCEN says you are an exchanger &amp; registration is required if you conduct more than $1000/day on a regular basis.

They provide a service. Bitcoin is still fairly difficult to obtain. The markup is not acceptable to you but it is for many. As an ATM operator I promise we are not gouging. We have bills &amp; vendors to pay &amp; the beauty of the free market gives you the freedom to not patronize your dollar. Others do, however. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:41:43
I am a friend of Morpheus &amp; fellow trader in AZ. The ammunition charge was just to keep him in jail while they built their case. The indictment that has come down since includes operating an unlicensed money transmitting business &amp; money laundering. More specifically, the charges on the laundering read: "The intent to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control, of property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, and with the intent to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under federal law, did knowingly conduct &amp; attempt to conduct a financial transaction affecting interstate or foreign commerce involving property represented by a law enforcement officer to be proceeds of specified unlawful activity.

This is not even close to what I see in practice. There is high demand &amp; people seek out the atm's. They are getting a lot of traffic &amp; are doing considerable volume. There's no way for me to verify this but I would venture to guess that almost zero of that comes from people who aren't there to buying bitcoin &amp; just happen to see a bitcoin machine. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:43:36
You only become subject to MSB regulations if you conduct more than $1000/day on a regular basis. Casual/occasional sellers could reasonably argue they are not acting in a business capacity. Whether FinCEN would agree with you is a different thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:45:29
Using the term "win" implies it's a zero sum game when it's not. Also what types of companies are you intending to compare here? Comparing atm's to exchanges is apples to oranges because they offer different value propositions. Trading speed &amp; convenience for anonymity &amp; vice versa. And if you think people simply won't patronize a company with higher prices that's also incorrect. Branding, reputation &amp; level of service can all affect consumer decisions beyond just price. See: Apple. I prices my machines competitively with the other atm's in my market. That's around 10-15%. I also answer phone calls &amp; emails promptly. This goes a long way in retaining loyal customers as I often hear how awful customer support is with my competitors. Making a blanket statement that atm's are useless only based on your needs &amp; acceptable markup price is simply ignorant &amp; I have sales numbers that flat out back that up. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:18:24
Significant markup to you. Not to my literally hundreds of customers. By the time all operational expenses are factored in, I make a very small percentage on each sale. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:54:23
If you sell for a profit there is no distinction between personal or business use. You are supposed to report capital gains either way.

As a commenter mentioned above, we are still at that early stage where there hasn't been a breakout software hit that gets it right, from security to user friendly to simple enough your grandma can use. So for the time the hard answer is you &amp; only you are responsible for your money, which means you're responsible for doing your homework &amp; comparing options for what's right for you. At this stage in the game nothing is bulletproof. I take all of the numerous recommended precautions &amp; I still have a healthy amount of fear about hacks.

Thank you -Olaf- for offering to step in. I was told a week ago that my ticket was getting escalated then nothing. Two emails from me later &amp; still nothing. My last email was 3 days ago stating if I didn't get an update I would be taking this story to the forums. Still nothing so that's what got us here. Sad that I threatened to take the story to the forums then still gave them a 3 day benefit of the doubt buffer to get back to me &amp; they didn't.

Depending on your paranoia level backing up files to email may not be advisable because your email is still hosted by a 3rd party. If you do trust your private keys on any cloud service you should be encrypting it before storing it there. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:33:05
That would break bitcoin entirely. If a supercomputer could retrieve someone else's lost bitcoin, theoretically they could "retreive" (steal) anyone's coins because they have to retrieve/hack/generate the private keys for those lost bitcoins. Therefore they could retrieve/hack/generate anyone's private keys.
