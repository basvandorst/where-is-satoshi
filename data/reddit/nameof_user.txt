I’ve seen this list, but I could fork Bitcoin right now and it would not be on the list.  I’m wondering how many times it’s been forked that we don’t know about
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:41:40
Question to settle office dispute:
Can anyone fork Bitcoin?  Is it really possible to tell how many times Bitcoin has been forked, if anyone can do it?
We are only aware of the popular/advertised forks, right?
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:50:55
How many altcoins are forks of Bitcoin versus copies of the software with tweaks? Is there any way to tell? Does the distinction matter?
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:48:28
This was my impression.  My coworker is trying to say it’s only been forked three times, but I’m thinking there are probably a lot of forks we never hear of.
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:28:41
Awesome! Thank you for the github source, this is exactly what i was looking for!
Edit:  so is the “pull” number the one I’m looking for on the github page
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:47:14
Thank you for the response!
Is there a distinction though between 1) copying Bitcoin’s software, tweaking it, and releasing a new altcoin and 2) “forking” Bitcoin, tweaking the software, and creating an altcoin that kind of runs alongside Bitcoin?
How many altcoins are forks versus how many are copies? Is there a way to tell?

He hasn’t been buying because he’s waiting for the price to drop. Meanwhile, the price has been increasing, which means if he had bought he would have maid money. Therefore, he counts the missed opportunity of making money as losing money 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:46:45
I’m also interested in knowing how to make sure I get all the forks
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:52:25
Sadly true :/
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:51:49
Haha yeah, I think his first “yes” reply suggested that you are, in fact, too crazy too invest $30 in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:39:37
It was just smashed
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:00:59
Generally people advise not to keep your coins in exchanges. Look at MtGox. An exchange can always crash or be hacked
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:34
Where are you buying $1 worth!? (Fees)
You definitely can make small purchase, but if you get too small then the fees eat up your investment 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:07:39
No, loans do not count as income 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:12:54
I use binance. You can buy bitcoin or ether on GDAX, then send it to Binace and use it to buy IOTA.
I bought some IOTA and ARK and I’m just going to HODL both for at least a year, see if it increase in value like ether and litecoin did
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:41:04
Haha man, I had a very similar experience to you. I was looking at it in 2013 and was on the verge of buying in when it crashed. Then I walked away because I thought it was too risky. The psychology of wanting a whole coin definitely held me back too, I could’ve just put in $50-100 back in 2013... oh well
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:42:06
Yeah, I just bought some to HODL for at least a year.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:50
I mean, to be expected with all of the recent attention 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:35:47
You can place buy and sell orders at specific prices, meaning that if the price hits that point the purchase or sale will go through. Easiest way to buy BTC would be to find someone who has placed a sell order and buy at whatever price they placed.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:25:28
Even enough number
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:11:19
I’ve been moving BTC over pretty quick, but ETH will definitely be quicker 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:59
Somehow I’ve tuned in at exactly the right time to watch the $12k and $13k walls fall. Missed the 14k though, even though I’ve spent half my day watching haha
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:42:42
People buying and selling it. The value is based on what people think it’s worth
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:08
Looks like it’s going to be another interesting week
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:02:05
In the time it takes to leave or read such a comment, it’s probably time to buy again.
Buy the fucking dips 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:56:20
Well you have ownership rights in the coins, but the exchange could lose them and not have the resources to give you your property 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:43:46
I’d definitely be buying 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:22:32
But if transaction fees are high, won’t that dissuade people from using BTC to transact
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:43:45
Big buys and sells combined with big gaps in buy and sell orders
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:50:13
Any amount that you are willing to lose is not crazy to invest.
I was just pointing out the funny wording. I think you were going for, “would I be crazy to invest $30 in Bitcoin?” But, instead it read “Am I too crazy to invest $30 in Bitcoin?”
These are two very different questions. You seem sane enough to invest to me, but what do I know. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:44:26
What is this cloud mining business?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:21:01
To buy altcoins you usually need to use BTC or ETH. So you’ll have to get ahold of that
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:19:07
I think a lot of time Coinbase buys the BTC from people who have placed sell orders (which are almost always higher than the current price)
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:57:50
Blockchain is the future
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:01:25
You’re going to have to do a lot of research. There are many ways to set up a blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:50:58
Woah there, that’s a big ask.
You should try: could you spare a few satoshis u/coinbaseisslow 
No? That’s okay, have a fine day now!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:44:45
Wait... you can send it directly to your wallet without it first going to your CB wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:46:29
Then watching the $12200 sell wall get eaten as well. I helped out a tiny bit on that one
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:38:38
I can’t decide for myself, wouldn’t want to give you bad advice 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:23:56
There’s no reason it can’t go over $3 million
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:21:40
That’s pretty damn good
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:10:33
Mmmmm that sweet sweet MIOTA
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:07:07
Buy some ripple
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:34:17
I think the first future is dated for Wednesday. So it wouldn’t make sense to dump until right before that
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:06:16
An interesting cryptocurrency that offers quick and free transactions and operates using a “tangle” instead of a blockchain
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:32:26
My bullshit-radar doesn’t go off either when you say you’ll send me a few bits, but that seems too good to be true!
Edit: I have .01 BTC right now that I plan on HODLing for the long haul. The plan is to keep buying and maybe one day get to that shiny whole coin (and beyond)
Edit: No bullshit from u/thieflar! Thank you so much again! I’m one step closer to that whole coin. I’m going to buy some people some BTC for the holidays in your honor.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:47:26
Come on, Bitcoin! Play Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:37:06
Hmm sounds interesting, I’m going to have to look into that 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:49:07
There still is a $12K USD wall. A very high one. It’s going to take a lot of buying to clear it
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:18:15
I have a true story for ya, not very exciting though. 
I was creating an account in 2013 to buy one shiny Bitcoin for $900. It was asking for my bank information and I was a bit sketched out, so I held off for a bit. Then the price crashed to $400. Instead of buying TWO shining Bitcoins, I decided it was too risky and walked away.
God damnit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:26:34
Put in what you’re willing to lose, that number is going to be different for everyone. If you believe the value is going to continue to increase over time, then it would be logical to continue to put money in each week.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:55
Haha hey 1 coin sounds like a great start ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:07
Hahah that was my entire day, luckily I’m getting home now and I can just stare at the depth chart
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:20:18
Yes, I believe Coinbase is also subject to New York’s bitlicense, which is a fairly stringent regulation. These aren’t quite the wild west days of MtGox. 
I generally trust Coinbase, but a lot of people got burned by MtGox and will tell you to never trust an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:28:24
I use GDAX, but idk which is better
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:27:09
Just buy high and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:19:51
Okay how do I go about doing this? What wallet should I use? (I’d rather not pay for a wallet)
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:54:20
People who want to go long are probably dumping now in anticipation of people shorting it. Then gonna buy the dip 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:27:40
Not gonna jump on the IOTA train now? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:43:52
Yeah, you’re buying it above market price. Coinbase does this because it’s the easiest way to buy. It’s very difficult to match up all the buyers/sellers at market price. If you sell, you are almost always going to sell to someone with a buy order slightly under market, and if you buy, then you’ll almost always buy from someone with a sell order slightly over market.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:06:53
Who will be holding the cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:45:48
Yes, the source said that, but your comment did not.
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:07:31
The Chinese elite must be hodling
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:06:42
Probably talking about Robinhood
