 Namecheap supports Bitcoin, you have to use add funds however to convert it to fiat in your account.

If they don't get into blocks eventually they just go away and don't actually happen

Indeed.  Transactions with fees get much higher priority, and zero fee transactions get back burnered, and possibly completely ignored.

You can try to doublespend and neither transaction gets through.  You can also send it as a zero fee transaction and it can possibly never go through.

Most of the time regulations help bankers and the government.  Bitcoin doesn't work that way at all, it does need recognition but not laws that can stifle Bitcoin and Bitcoin businesses

Make it based on the block number.
Pick a block number in the future.  Make the block 1MB to start on that block. Add 1% every time each block, rounded up to the nearest 4KB (or whatever value makes the most sense).

This isn't helpful for you, but you can store the private keys for 2FA on the cloud using Authy and a password.

I like this thread.  What magic do you work with?
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:14:44
 installs version 2.1.1, the standalone executable runs 2.2 however.

Empathy pain chainblocks?
@_date: 2015-08-05 02:06:16
None of them.  Use Electrum for Windows/Mac/Linux, Mycelium for Android and I think iOS, and Breadwallet for iOS

Get your private keys with Bitcoin here.  It does not have to sync to do this.  Put the private keys in sweep (there's an option in the menu) in Electrum, after you make the seed so you can backup using a seed.
This is assuming you gave up using Bitcoin core whoops lol.  Also sweep just transfers money out of private keys into your current seed/keys.

Soon the transaction will expire and it won't happen, your client will update you when this happens (if it's good).

Add a donation address so people can create more messages or just donate to your project?  Probably need an address for each.

Trezor with Electrum
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:49:07


RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN
Edit: use Electrum for windows instead.
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:04:44
Thank you :3
@_date: 2015-07-25 22:57:31
It would be better per KB since it's used in Electrum
