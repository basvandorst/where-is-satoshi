lets not mindlessly brigade another working product pls...already did that enough times

there is a bunch of FUD about coinbase here but its not unsafe at all...its quite fine. But if you want to use a different one try binance or Huobi.

yeah a lot of people are starting to dislike this sub and the r /bt c because its becoming too hivemindy.

i came looking for these posts too...if OP wanted to..you could have called this dip an hour before it happened with TA. Look at fibs and lines of support and resistances...they will help you feel less worried..should find support at 13k range and bounce (probably 13.3)

oh boy...lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:18:06
it was because an exchange got hacked...thats why everything is falling

This is good for DOgecoin

That was the Hedge funds article from bloomberg probably

next time use ETH, LTC, XLM to transfer coins and convert back to BTC

just an fyi this whole drop has nothing to do with roger or BCH...BCH doesnt effect the global crypto markets as this sub believes it does...volume is mainly korea driven but aside from that 
THE REASON WHY WE ARE GOING TO FALL TO 13K SUPPORTS is...(i thought liqui got hacked but it was unverified) guess it really was more in line with an over peaking BTC with very little buy volume
Edit: Possibly Liqui got hacked-

i think it was just a missunderstanding for the people that downvoted. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:29:09
does this sub want to be the same as that one? posts like this are a waste of space
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:26:56
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:27:59
atleast they keep an open mod log...do we have one here?
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:32:11
yeah thought it would be better for the user to decide what to do with their 'dividends'. BCH is pretty stable at -800 so if it breaks that should be good opportunity to get in i guess

Im curious to know what that black box is..seemed to have altered the existing code quite drastically
