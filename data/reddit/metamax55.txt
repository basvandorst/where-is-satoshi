The sentiment is increadibly bullish, and if the institutional money does bring all it is said to bring... my oh my it's going to be a ride of a lifetime!

You need to be very careful with trading. So risky.

\- much higher awareness ;
\- much more robust infrastructure;
\- much wider acceptance;
\- institutional money;
Do you honestly believe we will stop at 20k? Will swish past it like this 6k "resistance" that we were told was a thing. The human greed was real back in 2017. Now the upcoming institutional greed will be a whole different story. Prepare to visit wonderland.

I'd very much like to be able to say in my lifetime: "I remember when Bitcoin was still under one million."

You don't default on debt if you're USA. You print more money.

Oops, my bad. This euphoria tho...

I sincerely wish the turmoil in Venezuela would end soon and people can go on with their normal lives. Having been born in the USSR I know first hand what such a drastic regime change can do to a country and its people.

Probably is. But the euphoria... like sun after a long cold winter)

Buy a little every day. If it goes up, you can increase you daily contributions. It it goes down you buy cheaper. Will definitely help you sleep better. Cuz going all in and seeing the price drop shortly after - it hurts.
