This is the crux of the disagreement then. The reason people have upvoted this post is they *do* see financial turmoil as a precursor to higher bitcoin adoption. I certainly do.
Various bank failures are going to make bitcoin adoption more appealing to Greeks, no?
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:09:17


If there's a huge surge in bitcoin adoption in Greece won't you want to know the backstory? Ground-level posts like this aren't going to be around if that happens.

If you call people retards when they disagree with you, all people are going to stop talking to you about their ideas.

Absolutely excellent post. I write this because my one vote feels inadequate.

That's a great way to get locked into a [local maximum, instead of a better, higher maximum](
Same thing applies to alternative energy sources, or startups getting publicly funded loans. A service that could be a ton better in the future isn't necessarily going to be better right now. What you're describing is what the general public does, not what visionaries do.

I can see you're very concerned with only doing computation that earns you money but that's not my point here at all.
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:20:36

There's no correlation between piercings/tattoos and being informed as far as I know.
But there is a correlation between reading and being informed. Reading lots of articles naturally corrects these basic grammatical errors.
I may even completely agree with Bimbleb's points, who knows? But I could spend 25 hours a day reading the points of people on the internet. Instead I do the best I can to filter out the noise. When I see signs that someone doesn't read often (really basic grammatical errors), yes, it does mean they are less likely to have something meaningful to say.
If you wish to give everyone a chance, good luck to you. You will find a lot of good ideas, I'm sure. But you will also read a lot more shit.
I just vomit burped! Gross.

I guess it's hard to market an idea when the first word that you hear shares its roots with "cryptic".

Really fair point. This is the first time I've been on reddit interacting with people who have money invested in their arguments. Never occurred to me.

Confusion between bitcointip and changetip. But honestly changetip just isn't a very descriptive name so it's a good trade.

I removed the pennies thing because it's not really my point.


If I wanted to learn about mining I'm sure I could figure this out, but that's not my point. What simple terminal command can I give cgminer? I installed cgminer and it doesn't seem to work as simply as I described in my post. I am on Linux.
I would think that a healthy variety of machines working on the blockchain is good for Bitcoin. Especially if a hashing algorithm came about that desktop computers had a fair shot at again. It always seemed strange to me that a simple command like the one I described doesn't exist.
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:16:02


I'm not challenging this, but what makes you think you understand the blockchain and bitcoin? I'm a fairly decent programmer and I do not fully understand it, even after many hours of study.

No. My laptop is old and I don't think it could handle doing this in the summer. Nor could it ever produce anything really. I knew all this before posting, which I tried to make clear.

I'm a high school teacher and I'd like to clear up a few misconceptions here. First though, I agree the "ten year old draft" is suspicious.
However: I have also literally heard another teacher say "Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme". Teachers can also be assholes and yes, mark a paper zero for whatever reason including "unacceptable!". Teachers may also write a red X through the page. Finally, a ten year old can *certainly* write about bitcoin instead of Star Trek replicators. One of my classes of advanced grade 7 students were making 3D games with Unity3D. They're way better with technology than we were at that age.
In my opinion the fictional parent should not go to war with the school, but rather politely meet with the teacher and a superior and instruct them on the reality of bitcoin. Teachers are supposed to be lifelong learners and if they reject the lesson they shouldn't be a teacher.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:19:43

If we compare a desktop computer that is always one, to a desktop computer that is always hashing, the difference is not hundreds of dollars in a monthly electricity bill.

Yes, but I'm not looking for a solution here. The obvious solution is to set up HTTPS.
Instead I'm wondering how often this attack happens in the wild. So far I'm just getting guessing. I'm starting to think bullshit answers are all I'm going to get from @_date: 2015-08-10 23:36:14
Yes I know. But I'm still curious, aren't you?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:23:04
The keys are technically recoverable, it's just a matter of what needs to be done and how hard it is. I will probably drop 50$ to replace the screen, once I verify that keys can be recovered from root on another phone.
In other words your comment is defeatist and unhelpful.

Well, there is certainly some danger of a man in the middle attack. I'm wondering what that risk is - not for practical security concerns, but out of curiosity.
@_date: 2015-08-11 01:27:27


How often it happens, and if anyone has known of that happening to bitcoin addresses specifically. Everyone in this thread is just bullshitting an answer so far.
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:39:15
The thing is that it's totally not worth it to set up HTTPS since I'm changing hosts in a few months and the website is truly insignificant at the moment.
This is more about curiosity than actual security.

Data can be intercepted and changed at any point along the lines of communication. The end user's computer could be perfectly clean and still receive a modified bitcoin address. It's called a [man in the middle attack]( HTTPS mostly solves this problem.
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:20:18


Sure they are. You just have to imagine how much money law enforcement is willing to spend to catch you. If using bitcoin and tor makes prosecuting asthma-wife-husband cost too much, then it's perfectly adequate for that crime.
I think what you mean is bitcoin and tor are not anonymous enough for breaking laws that law enforcement investigates with high priority.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:27:58


If someone asked how to replace a smashed screen on a phone, you could say the same thing.
If someone's phone is stolen they should consider the bitcoin on it to be compromised, use their seeds, and move them elsewhere. Mycelium doesn't magically encrypt its keys upon launch - there is no passphrase for the generated wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:36:56


I suppose you missed my point then. Otherwise I'm not sure why you'd contradict me without addressing the point I made. How are the extra dollars he's paying not for him, if his coverage before was an illusion and now it is not?

It's almost like they have no idea what bitcoin can do. How easy it is for anyone to send any address bitcoin. I know it's easy to be cynical, but this is actually really surprising coming from FinCEN.

I'm sure this client has a credit card or line of credit. Why isn't that automatically set up as overdraft protection? Inform the customer that this is done when they set up their account, and give them an opportunity to opt-out. If their checkings hits a wall they get a warning phone call or email.
No such infrastructure exists. I recently hit a brick wall trying to set up something much, much simpler.
If I have a few credits cards and a few lines of credit, why is it even possible to pay those off "in the wrong way". That is, accidentally paying the lower interest one first because one is compounded monthly and the other is compounded daily, one has insurance fees and the other does not. Of course banking is obfuscated - that's why accountants still exist when most of them should be replaced by computers.
