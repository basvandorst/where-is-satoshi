He's the worst kind of autistic.

It's a tumbler account. Look at the history, it goes back to 2012, and everything that goes in comes out in pairs.

I'm personally waiting until Gox kills itself; that should spark a drop and then BTC will recover. I think it's going to get worse before it gets better.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:57:32
not true.

The dude who wrote that is 2 bit idiot. Still doesn't give us any reason to trust what he says.

You are right, I only heard about mtgox because I was interested in bitcoin; I was never interesed in Magic the gathering. But still, it's hard to take the website seriously when you know what the acronym stands for. Especially if you are a comedian.

That would actually be really interesting, and potentially very profitable for Zuckerberg. He pays all the debts to keep some trust, rebrands and secures gox, then throw in some FB integration? If I had billions of dollars I'd do it. I'd do a lot of other things first though.

It's a tumbler.

Do you expect him to ignore the hilarity in that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:21:32
No, they said the announcement will be about security related stuff. Specifically said it wouldn't have anything new about Gox.  Maybe they don't want to leak anything early though.

Right when mtgox went blank I checked the source and it was absolutely blank. It was only a few hours or so ago that the html source changed to what it is now. There is absolutely no reason for them to go from a completely empty source, to an empty source with a cryptic comment in it, unless they were trying to manipulate. They can just as easily (actually it's even easier) prepare the html source for an "announcement" offline and publish it when it's ready.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:43:16


Are we talking about the same gox?
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:36:36
 and 
Mentions an announcement, but say there is nothing new with regards to Gox.

Along with what other people have said, blockchain.info gives you a recovery mnemonic that lets you restore your entire account if you forget the password and/or your account page. 
Create a wallet [on blockchain.info]( and see if the mnemonic is of the same kind of form for what you have. Takes about 15 seconds to make the account.

"In order to restore funds to Mt. Gox, we have decided to exploit a bug in the bitcoin protocol called transaction maleability to  re-process all of the deposits into accounts."

Just mention the N word and you'll probably get out regardless of how they interpret it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:35:44
Yeah I wouldn't trust a thing they say other than "coins are gone, lol sorry."

Mark Karpeles casts Illusion. It's not very effective.

If he wants to keep any trust in the brand he will pay the liabilities as well.

If I want to send 100 BTC to some other account, but I want to obscure where it came from, I can use a tumbling service. I along with many other people send the BTC to some third party account (like the one you linked) and all the coins get forwarded through the tumbler account (maybe through multiple tumbler accounts) and the origin of the coins becomes harder and harder to trace.
If you look at the transactions in the account, they always come in pairs (2500 in, 2500 out).
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:51:12
[Yep,  first transaction with the account was made close to two years ago.](
All inbound transactions match outbound as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:52:25
They specifically said no new details regarding mt gox though.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:36:55
Because if it is an illegal operation, any money that is received from them can likely be confiscated. I know it isn't illegal, but it's certainly "risky" from a bank's point of view.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:52:21
Well that's not funny.
