No problem, beta testing for iOS will be available within 2 weeks. Will DM once it's out!

Thanks for the feedback! We will include charts later on, that's a bit tricky to implement for multiple exchanges. As for your chart overlay suggestion, do you mean it as a form of arbitrage tracking? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:54:20
When we chose Bittrex's protocols they mentioned nothing about restricting registrations :( Definitely will be adding other exchanges in the future though, Binance and Gdax is next on the list
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:18:25
All 3 are on the todo list, will be released once everything else is stable!

It's got a few stats that are automatically calculated for you, and other triggers like ATH that I personally use (it's made me a good amount the past few weeks in the bull market for me since I catch breakouts with it). I'm also working on a few other custom indicators that I personally have found some success with, just testing it out now before I roll it out to the next beta
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:51:11
Good suggestion, will add it once beta is over!

It's not a trading app, it's a portfolio management app that keeps you updated about how your coins are doing + a bunch of other investor\trader-oriented features. You can't buy/sell anything with it at the moment, you'll have to do that through an official exchange app or website
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:26:42
Yes, you can. Just add them in and it'll automatically take care of the rest. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:21:35
Nope, exchanges would never real such sensitive data - why would they?
Here's bittrex's official API documentation: nothing regarding IPs\personally identifiable info: 
And here's Binance's: 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:35:28
We'll need to go through a web interface for that. We currently don't have one in the pipelines yet, so it might take some time. We will have to individually cater to each exchange regardless since the excel data is formatted differently on each exchange. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:47:09
You can just add in how many coins you have and it'll track the price based on your preferred exchange selected :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:29:39
Only Binance and Bittrex for now. Gdax and kucoin is next on the list :)
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:18:16


I was referring to his question in which he asked about any identifiable information that exchanges give through their APIs. 
Sure I could get his IP, but it applies to everything else on the Internet...
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:22:45
Sounds much better than the boring "ROI" imo &gt;:(
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:26:13
It's entirely possible to do everything from the mobile device, but not feasible. It would take ages and how would we factor in the price fluctuations without querying a ton of other data sources? We don't want to waste your bandwidth and processing power and make you wait ages for something so trivial :P As far as I know, every other major portfolio app (Blockfolio, Delta, etc) communicates your trade data with their servers too. There's a reason not everything is done in situ.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:05:50
Not at the moment, sorry, but definitely on the todo list
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:22:41
There's a reason why the other apps don't do this. It's not as easy as getting one-to-one data. There's other data we need too: historical data (how are we going to plot your chart without that?), inferred USD data (some markets don't have USD), price\ATH triggers (do we really want to keep a background service running 24/7 on your mobile phone?) and a bunch of other stuff that took us a while to figure out. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:06:16
Great suggestion, never really thought of EUR since everything we personally track is in terms of USD. Will add it in the upcoming versions :)

Whole of China is out? ok

Thanks for the compliment! Yes, all your trade go through our servers  to be processed. The comment below raises a valid question - it's because we process each trade, price you bought at, profit metrics etc before sending it off to the mobile. For example, if you bought ETH at 0.2 BTC (not sure if it ever hit that ratio, but just an example) at 2016, BTC back then wasn't much. Most apps would key it as a loss since ETH\BTC ratio is much lower than 0.2 at the moment, but we factor in the price context at time of purchase to properly calculate your true profit\loss in USD automatically. 
Nevertheless, we're not interested in anyone's trade data, and nothing is stored. Immediately after retrieval, the history is deleted and no personally identifiable information is stored (since we don't have accounts related to each app instance). 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:21:45
I understand where you're coming from - when we first started Blockfolio was the only available app and we weren't really happy with it being the only available option, so since we were really into crypto at that time we decided to take some time off building something the community really could use. 
The API keys are only a convenience, people can still enter trades manually. 
With regards to competition: at first glance it does look like we're just another portfolio app, but a lot of thought and effort went into how we want the user experience to be like. 
We have many friends who are traders, and watching them manually inputting trade data one at a time across many different exchanges is a huge hassle. Allowing automatic API reads alleviates this problem and properly calculates each of your trade's profitability, average buy ins for a  coin, etc so most of your time is actually spent trading than setting up your portfolio app. 
We also make things much easier for users who've made trades months or even weeks ago since the price of BTC fluctuates so much. 
Let me illustrate with an example: if I bought ETH around mid Nov (it was around 0.044BTC\ETH), a user would simply enter this directly into the portfolio app, but what's missing is that it doesn't take into account the true fiat value at that time. You're basically stuck with how much you earned\lost in terms of BTC - what about fiat? We take care of all of this for you and in the end what you get are the key stats: sure you made some BTC since it's about 0.08 at time of post, but way, way more in terms of USD, which is what a lot of people are actually interested in. We don't tie you down to a particular base pair, we let you gauge performance between different ones (currently only BTC and USD). As a user, you simply look at your trade history and input directly (or automatically if you want) and we take care of the rest. 
Edit: Sounds like a big sales pitch after rereading what I just said but we don't earn anything from this (yet!, and probably not in the future as well lol) and want nothing to do with your private data.

Not at the moment, sorry. Only currently on the Play Store and App Store 
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:37:02
No, but if you feel that we are missing out any particular projects or sources, feel free to drop a PM. We will continuously filter and readjust over time
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:00:06
Thank you! Wanted to keep it as simple and easy to use as possible. You're right about the price ticker, will add it in on the next release.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:09:42
Dip? They can just transfer over to Ok\Huobi and trade for another 30 days before possibly cashing out, and even then probably not as it'll just happen OTC anyway. I am not sure the Chinese would ever want to go back to fiat once they have had a taste of BTC  :]
