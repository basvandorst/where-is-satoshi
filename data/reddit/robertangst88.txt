Oh yeah don't get me wrong, its expected that the car is going to have issues. 
The problem is most consumers have no idea. Consumers had a Ford that needed 3 or 4 repairs in 10 years and are expecting that quality. Ford has literally decades of data and they still have the occasional problem. Tesla had less than 100k cars ever. 
They are cool, but tbh, they function poorly.

For the longest time I didn't freaking care about this petty squabble.
However, I tried getting my bitcoin out of Circle and Coinbase. Neither are supporting Bitcoin Cash.
Circle, die a horrible death. But this was expected, they werent going to update their now depreciated software. However, these are where my first bitcoins are.
Coinbase, they SHOULD give us the ability to decide what to do with bitcoin cash. They aren't and we should be pissed at that. 
HOWEVER, since both forms of my bitcoin are tied up and cannot give me bitcoin cash, I don't support it. I imagine almost every casual bitcoin user has the same issue. 
I dont think a bitcoin fork will ever work because 100% of noobs arent going to put the effort into getting on the new fork. I do expect an alt coin to be successful at solving finance issues like bitcoin originally intended.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:05

I wanted to sell my Bitcoin Cash since Bitcoin Alts always fail. Coinbase has taken months and months and we are hoping for support in January.
I started telling friends that they get bonus points for avoiding coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:31:49
People will now be able to do things like 'short' bitcoin.
Short is when you borrow X and sell X today, then buy X later. 
So if bitcoin today is 10k, you sell(make 10k) and in a few months, your goal is to buy for less than 10k so you can give back X.
The effect means volatility will likely go down due to extra cash in the market, and more people trying to time the market. With lots of people timing the market, it will keep bitcoin closer to its real value.

@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:27
You are correct. The price going up(from this new legitimacy) will reduce volatility. 
It will also make it easier to 'game' bitcoin. When more and more people are trying to make money during the course of a day, the fluctuation often go down.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:41:26
Ive been watching bitcoin since 2010, bought in only recently. I was always skeptical of the splits, calling them nonsense. 
**Note: I consider myself a nerd, but was too stupid to get my bitcoin out of Coinbase before the split. This is going to happen for every bitcoin Fork ever.**
Bitcoin Cash is the first one I truely think is an impostor that is being pumped and dumped. 
When it first jumped from 300-600, it seemed like a pump and dump from some major groups. Now that its at 1,500, it seems some suckers believed in propaganda. 
They want people to leave Bitcoin despite Bitcoin being rare. Bitcoin Cash isnt rare, none of the alts are rare. 
Bitcoin is gold, its hard to move but rare. An alt coin like Ethereum is going to fix worldwide finance problems. Bitcoin Cash solves some problems, but is quite low quality like Litecoin.

Bitcoin Classic is rare. 
Altcoins are not rare.
I currently believe the value in bitcoin is the rarity.
If any altcoin becomes valuable, they become valuable like a company. They fixed a problem. It has everything to do with implementation and leadership. 
I don't see litecoin fixing enough problems to grow like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:06:29

Bitcoin is really heavy. Its like owning gold and trying to move it.
Ethereum fixed many of those problems with bitcoin, but it has their own problems too.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:25:01
Clarifying so we can both be right-
Low Quality in the automotive sense means parts that break or uncompetitive features.
I expect the leather wrapped headliner to last significantly less than a conventional headliner. I expect the inside(chassy + transmition) of the vehicle to break much more often compared to a conventional vehicle. I expect things like glove box latches and windows to have a shorter life than a new popular vehicle.
Lambos are a frustrating car to own. Lots of maintenance to deal with. I want my car to work.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:15:34

@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:22
Yes, I understand that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:54:41


That statement is incorrect. Litecoin is not connected to Bitcoin, its a unique currency. It doesnt solve bitcoins problem, its an entirely different currency with its own problems.
The same argument you have for litecoin can be said about the hundreds of other crypto currencies that exist. The biggest thing is finding the popular one and investing in the future of that technology to solve problems.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:01:04

" tested like Audis"
Thats extremely general and shows you don't work in Automotive.
Testing and field data is pretty insane for mass produced vehicles. You get hundreds of thousands of data points. They do not test a Lambo like a mass produced car. They do tests, but these are two different things.

Why are we using Lambos as a metric of wealth? Because they are a quarter million?
Can we start using a different metric because tbh, its 2017, nice cars are for old people. How about "James is never working again from the moon"
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:07:27
tbh, any sort of huge spike is likely a bubble. Slow and steady progress is sustainable. 
But that isnt how bitcoin works. Huge 50% swings are the norm. People should be ready to see their assets cut in half.

Both cars are pretty low quality.
Lambos are not tested like a Toyota/GM/Honda/Audi vehicle, they are job shop made. They arent designed to last a long time. 
Tesla is new, they don't have enough data to fix things like 0 squeak and rattle. They have tons of issues already, and as the cars get older, the problems will only come up more often.

They can convert bitcoin to dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:34:30


Yes, the instrument panel is unique. The door trim is unique. The interfaces may have changed due to packing issues. Thats where you are going to get squeak and rattle. Thats going to be why your window switch electrical wire gets pinched and you lose connectivity after 4 years of use. Its going to be why the glove box doesnt stay closed unless you lock it every time.

Alt Coins are bad because they are pump and dump schemes.
I've only used BTC, ETH, and LTC in transactions. LTC only bc ETH was jammed and I was using shapeshift to sell BCH at 4k/coin. 
BTC is a rare coin that has been crushing USD as a store of value for 9 years. 
The rest of the coins need a purpose. Cryptonoobies are chasing fiat conversions rather than valuing cryptocurrency. Also cryptocurrency is ONLY a public verified ledger. It's not going to store dental records.

There is no lambo meme, only a terrible decision to buy a half million dollar car to sit in traffic. 
I want to believe these are Lamborghini advertising on Reddit and not real people.
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:40:00
BTC people believe. 
No amount of news article will get me to panic sell. I believe

It's been almost a year and no one calls shitcoin cash, bitcoin.
This is fraud, not decentralized and unregulated.
This is intentionally misleading people.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:16:56
Do you consider the 2-4% inflation on USD theft?
It seems you use US law to determine if something is stolen or not.

Ikr and to store things like logistics and medical records on blockchain sounds awful
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:01:16
All of my friend group does.
Also I got a bitcoin debit card
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:06:09
Even better, the world is legalizing bitcoin. 
For many years there were fears of banning

I basically lost hope in academia. It's more politics than application.
Engineering doesn't get to use politics, engineering needs to be correct.

Can't tell if your account is a coinbase marketing account but I'm pulling all but 500 USD worth of bitcoin from coinbase. 
I've kept many BTC in coinbase since 2011 but u will never trust them again.
That 500 makes it easy to do transactions with friends and used for Shift card, but they cannot be trusted with money.
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:54:23
I'm thinking 4k at bottom, will panic fomo at 9k and spend the 5k I've been hording
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:57:55
I bought 0.5 BTC so far on the dip.
I was going to buy 2k USD DCA a week, but I think I'm going to save cash and try to time my next buy
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:15:49
I marked the account for fraud
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:21:06
Thank you.
No one else understands that blockchain is totally overblown. Centralized servers are almost always superior

My wife got 0.01btc in 2011, I skipped the booth and stole Gary Johnson's nametag.
How's that for equality?
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:13:23
You can't be serious
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:37:58
I bought 0.5 BTC on the dip and am saving up cash for the next dip.
Thinking either in BTC, the housing market, or stocks. Whatever the case, one of the 3 are going down evenutally
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:36:33
Good. Keeps newbies aware of fraud
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:06:39
Alt Coiners are especially guilty. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:13:46
This is how I feel. The world has called shitcoin cash, bch for the last year. 
They didn't call it bitcoin. If they did it would be null.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:55:03
Agreed. I've barely used on chain with Bitcoin. I've either used circle or coinbase. It's always fun to send it over the blockchain and follow it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:12:57
He's in too deep.
This is the only thing he has left. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:44:23
I've been thinking that since people said they wanted to store medical records on blockchain.
Wtf why
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:31:03
Yep learned this last time
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:42:41
Do you guys live in Alabama? 
I've seen at least a half dozen in South East Michigan. Not to mention there are hundreds of places that accept it around here According to those spend BTC Google map things.

Ikr, blockchain hype videos are peak YouTube shit posting.
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:44:47
Business owner and libertarian here.
Bitcoin is going to have dozens of ways to pay. Square is an easy company to use. You can use whatever you want.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:28:06
Probably me. Have many accounts
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:43:22
Tag for interest,
Maybe tech support like Ubuntu?
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:08:20
How does this work? You die and they freeze you?
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:38:26
I just didn't expect to see a half built WordPress site
