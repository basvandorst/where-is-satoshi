So what will Robinhood use as it's BTC price? Because it won't be an exchange like traditional exchanges where you can withdrawal and deposit coins. Will there even be a chance for arbitraging? How will the Robinhoods market price react to all the other exchanges in real time?

And in another universe this "smart" trader guy is saying: obviously when it went from $10k to $15k, you should of sold and bought the dip down at $8k. 
Lol, I love how easy it is to call the top and buy the dip after the fact. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:38:28
Here's the difference. Bitcoin might not be the base currency for buying traditional goods, but it will be the currency to buy tokens/other coins. Once we start seeing real use cases of these coins - when you actually want them for utility, BTC will be the currency to value them at, not in dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:42:14
But the question is, is bitcoin at $11k truly cheap or expensive? The market will decide in the next few months.

I will always feel the discomfort that guy will feel when it peaks to an ATH then corrects 20,30,50%. It's going to happen everytime it has a massive bull run - a group of people are always going to be scared, looking for advice, and paying more attention to negative news. The ones that survive and hodl will be the true test to a digital currency evolution. Only the strong will survive hodling thier coins.

Imagine if you were a whale, coordinating with other whales. You don't have to hope, you just choose when to make peaks and dips. Then you let 100s of thousands of minnows swim for their life, hoping to catch the high and low. Then you just collect off thier emotions, and take thier losses. Sure, a few might come out successful, but they will most likely lose the next time, as the whales change thier pattern each time.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:51:37
Yes. The whales know. They decide where to take the price.

Yea, but a bank is a service you use, they have terms of service. Even though it's your money from the beginning, you are choosing them to store your money. Do you think the bank would allow you to wire funds to a terrorist, drug dealers, weapon supplies? No. I know Bitcoin is not comparable to those things, but whatever the bank wants to control, along with the Fed (because it's insured by them), you have to abide to thier terms.
This is proof why we need Bitcoin as our own bank, where we can spend freely. And just to clarify in my post, I don't mean we need Bitcoin to support those illegal things, I just mean, we should have 100% control of our own money if we want to.

@_date: 2018-01-31 22:03:43
Maybe start by reading white papers, and actually understanding some code - how it all works and why people truly benefit from crypto.
You can research and gather all news about what other countries are doing with Bitcoin/crypto; how they are regulating, adopting, investing in bitcoin. How merchants are adopting or dropping the use of bitcoin. Looking into other alts and how thier approach is different or better and how it competes with bitcoin. 
There is tons of information to research to give you a better understanding of what Bitcoin/crypto is and why it may become highly valuable.

Yea, I understand that you don't want to be responsible for pushing people into something that could potentially make them lose money and have them hold it against you. But I'll be honest, every moment that it was going up all through 2017 I told my friends yea, get some, but not now, it's too high, wait for the big correction - that correction never came and it went up faster than they were prepared for - I did not expect bitcoin to go 20x in 1 year. 
I still have friends that are upset they missed the low price because they just constantly felt it was too high, and the higher it goes the more they feel uncertain. So point being sometimes if someone wants to get in, you should encourage them to just do it at that moment no matter what the price is - but always explain the risks associated with it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:45:08
2014/15 disagrees
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:01:39
But there is the argument about Bitcoin forking new bitcoin-coins, like Bitcoin Cash. Some people consider the true value of bitcoin to be bitcoin + bitcoin cash. So a fork can easily create a duplicated amount on the fly. Sure the new forked coin is not the official bitcoin, but all these forked coins hold value and steer money away from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:03:07
Exactly. I think 2018 will the year for alts. My fav so far is TRX. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:46:56
Key word "solely" is correct, however Futures definitely had an effect on the market and a big one, or was it just a coincidence right after CME futures started the price went only down significantly? Or shall we say it was a coincidence that the price rose significantly right up to when CME started? Hmm, an ATH up to CME, then a 50% correction beginning exactly when CME started. Nah couldnt have been the cause from CME could it?
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:38:44


Uhh, what. So the price of BTC goes down when people buy? I get it that there is always a buyer and seller, but there were less buy orders to be filled at higher prices back then, and that is why it dropped so quickly.
The price of BTC simply went down because people wanted out, they started to lose faith at those high prices. Geeze just look at all the people calling BTC garbage as it fell from 20k to 3.2k. Now that we are back up, people come out with "I wouldnt mind going to 3700 so I can buy more" (not saying there is anything wrong with this) but it's easy to confidently say this because there is more demand now. If people truly wanted BTC at low prices they would have always bought the dip and never let it fall that low in the first place.
So here is an idea to think about. If BTC does go to $100k, then buying today at $10k would be a steal. So why doesn't everyone just load up now because BTC is potential cheap from the future. Well, because they don't know $10k is cheap. BUT if it does hit $100k it is now automatically cheap at $10k. So next time anyone says I would have loved to buy BTC cheap at $10k if the price is $100k, I will say the same argument that I say now. Heck I will reference this post just to shut them up.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:07:36
Think of it this way, if worst case scenario happens and it goes to 0, you will go down with the entire sub here - they will not sell trust me. You can then meet up with everyone at a recovery group and get to find comfort with them as they share stories about who had the best bitcoin memes :)
But the odds of that happening are about the same as finding a computer in pawn shop that was never wiped and had 1,000 bitcoins in a wallet from 2013.

I can't wait for the $2000 memes. I remeber how excited I was. Nothing. Better than being on the sidelines and getting ready to buy low. Let's go $2000!!
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:06:18
What I find interesting is everyone that I hear talk about it acts like it was some lottery that they missed. Like "wow, you bought some back then, you must have made a lot of money, I guess I missed it". I'm like you can buy some now. They then say, no it's too late. 
They just don't understand why it's going up, they think it was just a lucky moment in time, and that it won't go any higher. But when it does go up they are gonna be even more confused when it doubles again to $30k. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:49:45
Depends on how you really think the market is reacting. When bitcoin hit it's ath there were people that bought at 19k, held on to probably 17k and decided it's going down a lot more and took the loss. Well they are now sitting pretty at 11k with a potential to rebuy the same amount of coins cheaper. Same with buying high, you can catch the wave for a little and get out with profits.
There is a chance everyone buying at 11k could think this is low, but in 2 months we could be sitting at 6k, and 11k was the high. It's really not that easy to determine the highs and lows - but all you can do is use good judgement on what news there is, how long the price has been sitting and the % swings.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:14:08
When it goes down, its clearly going to zero. 
When it goes up it's clearly going to $1M
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:10:37
Btc is just the crypto reserve. All coins pair to it. So if your shit coin is doing well in the market its going up to Btc. 
You can invest in shitcoins and maybe make a ton of Btc or just sit in Btc and and not make more Btc. 
So in the end you don't always have to come back to bitcoin, but if you want to sell your shitcoin you should sell to Btc not fiat.

@_date: 2019-07-05 01:25:36
Lol of course you say this when BTC has the spotlight. Who knows what the future is for alts, but if they shoot back up, your comment becomes moot.
Point being is any statement like this is only valid at that one moment of time, therefore it's not the best argument when taking about missing out on Btc, in 6 months you could make 10x more bitcoin holding alts, we just don't know.

@_date: 2017-12-01 10:17:00
Yea I totally agree - we just have no idea what will become of this. Lots of people tend to think it's something we already have and it should follow a similar trend. But this really could become HUGE and everyone who ignores it will just miss out. 
Reality is: $10k is crazy enough. So since we are this crazy, whats to stop it from just going full blown retard and shoot up to $1 Million?
@_date: 2019-07-21 02:27:57
Why does it matter? You will sell way before it ever hits that price.
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:05:54
Yeah except when you use BTC and an intermediary, more fees are applied. People may think it's baby steps by sending BTC to a service that sends fiat to the recipient, but at the end of the day, MORE money is being coughed up between parties.
Until its strictly crypto without a middleman shall we celebrate.
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:58:13
You WILL have to trade BTC for something if you want to get value from it. There is no point in holding BTC if you dont trade it. Possibly trade it for a million alt coins.

I am really curious what the % of dumb money is entering bitcoin vs legitimate countries with corrupt economies, serious institutional investors, business opportunities, etc...

As risky as it was, I took a big gamble, I know. But being a huge believer in Bitcoin, doing my research, and understanding where I think the technology will go I finally had a lot of money to make a crazy gamble to support my belief in Bitcoin. Savings are just savings, I've been through life without savings before so I wasn't that scared.
@_date: 2019-07-13 05:40:15
That was my original point, you still have to trade BTC for something to get value from it. That something could be a million French fries, and those fries are valued to other things as well, maybe 100 LTC. 
So you are indirectly trading BTC for 100 LTC. 
What I'm hearing from this meme is, just holding BTC you automatically receive stuff without having to trade your BTC. Like dividends or something.

I think it has to do with time. If the price took 1 year to go from $1000 - $12,000, then drops to $2500 in 1 week. That is a crash. But if it shoots up to $20,000 tmr then comes down to $10,000 3 days later it's a correction. But of course people will call it a crash.

If all goes to bitcoin becoming valued as 1 btc = 1 btc, then it won't be valued in money. Soon companies will start paying in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin reduces it volatility to say a gain of only 3% year. We will have salaries paid in bitcoin and when receiving a raise you just maintain your btc income. If you don't receive a raise you will actually get a drop in btc. Minimum btc wages will actually decrease - but still stay relative to it's buying power.

It would take a serious bug to destroy bitcoin or major regulation that convinced people that bitcoin is bad and some new regulated coin is better.

Everyone back when it was 2000 laughed saying the next crash will be from 20k to 10k, then 40k to 25k then 100k to 60k, it's gonna continue this cycle guys, don't worry. You will be that guy in 40-25 telling newcomers to just hodl.

Bitcoin is actually an experiment to reduce the human population. Destroy balls by absurd price speculation bets, reduce reproduction. Bingo the easiest solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:46:07
The way I look at it is, if Bitcoin is truly going to a trillion dollar market it will happen with or without risky people leveraging their investment. If these people panic and sell, driving the price lower some other guy is gonna take advantage of that deal. 
I don't think Bitcoin is really that sensitve to lose control and just plummet because a minor amount of people can't handle thier emotions and let go.
But besides all this, yes you should not invest more than your willing to lose - but regardless Bitcoin won't take a huge beating if sensitve people sell, they will only beat theirself, and others will get bitcoins for cheaper.

Because we have instant information now, new investment opportunities are accelerated way more. So to the traditional investor they see this as a get rich quick scheme because history has proven that anything that goes up this fast is not real. But I think now that we live in a world with instant on demand information, this might just be normal growth.

True, there is more to the $ signs. But in my personal view, I am not looking to sell for fiat until it will wipe my debt free and I still have bitcoin left over that I will never sell until it becomes accepted as a true currency - by that time I will not be selling but just exchanging for goods. They way I look at it is, the $ signs are more of a reflection of adoption than getting rich.

It truly is, and if bitcoin does succeed and most of the world does adopt it, it will be huge! So big, most people fail to see how cheap bitcoin is now. I used to get excited thinking I'm making all this money with bitcoin, but I've started to realize, it's not about the money but the tech, and revolution. I feel like fiat is losing value to this new monetary system, so it actually compels me to sell off my fiat for something I believe is more valuable.

Yes but is "food" a good store of value? What if you think you're the best food supplier in town, everyone needs it right? But then some competition arises and they sell food cheaper, and your food eventually spoils. 
There needs to be a unit we can trade that stores "energy". Be it labor, food, electricity, creativity, etc. Something that cant be controlled, to where it destroys the honest value of what was put in. 
This is something bitcoin could become far in the future once it's a standard and the liquidity is so high, volatility is non existant. 
Or... something else comes along and does it better. We just don't know, but speculate this is where the economy and future will converge.

You're not "stupid" for buying any of the alts high. They all were pumping like crazy, and no one knew how high they could go. 
In June 2017 my buddy slowly invested in ETH at $200-$300, then went all in throwing $10k at $400! It crashed all the way to $130 that next month. He felt extremely stupid, depressed all that negative stuff. He ended up selling at $400 to get his money back when it started pumping again. Well it went to $1400! I guess he wasnt that stupid, only stupid for selling, right? Bottom line, you just don't know how high, low, how long these cycles last. You can only try to use best judgement but even still it can mean nothing.

Bitcoin is at 55% and Alts 45%.

Yea, that's true it most definitely can go either way. I just think selling at these prices is very risky even if it's a little pump. I only buy now even on the way up and accumulate. If we break $10k, I will start selling a little off, but in the end I think anything under $10k is a good deal long term.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:17:30
But that's what people fail to see. It's not about putting money in to make more USD money like a traditional investment. It's about exchanging worthless fiat into something that is holding a better value, which has been going up for 8 years.

Must be strange for some people to think their meme culture is being taken seriously - sorta ironic. But it's so indicative that we will research and value everything on the web (just another term for world wide digital culture). Just look at bitcoin. Take a person from 2008 and tell them what the future is about. Now take a person from 2018 and tell them what the future is about. Internet culture will start to dominate traditional cultures and societies. It's very strange, but just the way the future is shaping to be.

Be quite the leap if soccer mom's are buying and selling bitcoin lol. I think there are new comers buying and selling, but most likely there are more people convinced it's a bubble and not buying. The crazy part here is, if say 70% of new people exposed to bitcoin see it as a bubble and don't buy, and 30% actually buy, when the price jumps even higher it puts more pressure on that 70%. Then another wave see bitcoin, think it's a bubble and more pressure again. The fact that they are initially taught it's a bubble but maybe proven wrong for that moment indirectly forces them to buy. If the price gradually went up, that 70% may never buy. So of this continues and bitcoin stays strong, it's going in the 6 digits.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:44:42
Not really. It's to have more buying power. As soon as I convert BTC to USD I will pay off debt, or buy what I need. Never will I hold USD in the bank. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:10:55
But has the price gone down significantly? So what if it slowed down a bit, that is actually good. As we saw when it rises to fast when it hit $19400 last week it comes down very hard. A slow steady climb is healthy.
Bitcoin is working in 3 stages. 
1. Connect people by investing, owning it. Building the network.
2. Becoming store of wealth. A savings account.
3. Transact as a currency..
Stage 3 won't happen for 3-5 years. We are in stage 1 right now. Don't miss out.

I make contracts (bets) with my co-workers all the time.
Let's make a deal for $10
Me: "Bitcoin will break $10,000 by 2018"
Him: "No it won't"
He now owes me $10 because Bitcoin did break $10,000 by 2018
This is how I understand Bitcoin Futures to work. The real manipulation comes from whales trying to make those contracts end in their favor. So if I was a huge whale, I could have taken advantage of my coworker and went on a bitcoin exchange and pushed the price so high to break $10k and win that contract. But what's to say he is not a whale also, and tries to sell Bitcoins to never allow $10k to be reached. Futures shall pave the way to help lower volatility.  
Point being, to play the Bitcoin game, you are right that you don't need to own Bitcoin, but let's say none of them will actually buy or sell real Bitcoin. They will have no direct influence on the market with their contracts. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:04:58
I have one of those little physical bitcoins I got off amazon. It weighs about 1.44oz. So, lets find how many physical bitcoins we get per lb. So 16oz/lb we get 16oz/1.44oz give us 11.11 bitcoins/lb.
So 11.11 bitcoins x ~$20k = $222,200/lb of bitcoins.

Ok just to be clear I want to only speak about bitcoin. The thing is, there is no discussion, bitcoin is here, the fundamentals havent changed, it's been accepted as the dominate crypto currency, so just buy and hold, that simple; it's already succeeded. There are risks in everything in life, so yes there is a risk that bitcoin goes to zero, just like a risk that a plane can crash into your house. But everything we know is pure proof that bitcoin is to keep going up. If people trade short term, catch the bottom, catch the top, then that is totally different, bitcoin goes in cycles every 4 years, due to the halving. So we will break the ATH again in a couple years. So if you want to be stress free, dont trade.
People are afraid of bitcoin cause of its massive speculative spikes which make it extremely volatile. If no one had a fomo orgasm and bought it up to $20k, but instead let it naturally climb to 6k today, people would feel more confident with it and not associate it to  maybe it will go to zero. It going to zero is like the Sun not rising tmr, it's not ever going to happen in our lifetime. 
But truth is, once it gets momentum again, people are gonna start talking about it, it will gain speed and blow up into another huge bubble, and then come down and the fudsters will say: See you shouldn't hodl, look it came all the way down, most likely going to zero (when it's actually really high, multiples higher than the last crash). I mean geeze, we have seen bitcoin perform for 10 years now! How long does it need to be around for people to realize nothing has changed, it's just going up and up and up with drops on the way. 
Bottom line is, you can talk about bitcoin to others or not, whatever, but if you try to explain all the technical jargon, the risks, the blah blah blah, then people try to use their "professional research skills" and evaluate if bitcoin is a safe investment and may even sell when they think they are being smart. "Oh the news is right, bitcoin cant do this, this alt does it better" all nonsense! Thats ALL just distractions to get people to sell! Just buy, hold, forget and check back in 4 years - done.

It's a law end of story. Doesnt matter if it's ever converted into USD or not. If btc is "worth" more from the date you acquired it and its traded for anything else (another coin, service, product, advice from a stranger), there are supposed to be taxes on it. Sure many of these traded things are probably very hard at determining a price, and loop holes could be found, but at the end of the day, the IRS is trying to seal all holes at people trying avoid taxes.

I think the traditional financial system got us to where we are effectively, just like gasoline vehicles. Truth is, we could never have a bitcoin like currency in the past cause we did not have efficient computers with internet, just like we didnt have electric vehicles cause we didnt have efficient battery storage tech.

You make many wallets and spread out your coins. As soon as you are required to give your private key so they can seize your coins, you give them whichever ones they know about.

Cant wait to see a post like this in 3 months. 
"You last logged in 1 year ago, bitcoin is now down 65%. Your account's market value is: Hidden, for your safety. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:53:56
Because of its scarcity. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, so if each person wanted 1 bitcoin the value would be insanely high. 
You are right that the value is in the network and not the bitcoin itself. There is no way you could have 1 person own all the bitcoins while still holding value at $20,000 a coin. Theorectically, the less people involved the less the price is, the more people the more it's price rises. 
And that is the beauty of bitcoin, despite the price it will still function exactly as designed. This I think is it's greatest strength, because bitcoin can never be screwed up - it just exists - it's up to the users if they want it or not, not bitcoin struggling to solve new problems and attract users like say a business. It's like a new resource introduced into our world. The community of users is the only thing that can be destroyed not the actual bitcoin itself. So if say many users give up on it, and it drops down to $10 for 10 years, it could start up again and jump back up to $20,000 if a new group of people emerge that believe in it. 
And yes, a new crypto coin could easily be created, or fork off, that could overtake bitcoin in a more practical use case, we just don't know, and that is why there is so much speculation, uncertainty, risk, and excitement. But still, bitcoin will be there, in existance, The future could still change their mind and want to own bitcoin again.

This is the moment hodl is on the spotlight. We all know it means pure garbage if you have a time frame to sell cause it can hurt early on, cause hodl can take 1-10-50-XX years to finally prove itself. And of course the early people who got into bitcoin worship hodl cause it has granted them their wish many times, so they have to share their miracle stories.
The reality is though, lots of people have no experience in a crash, and what to do in it. So hodl pisses them off, and selling is the final option they have control over, cause *why* buy when no one wants to own it right? Well... people buying now are the ones taking on a new risk, which could be the move to make all the gains. But we just dont know, and that's why I would never sell to give another guy **my** opportunity to a fortune.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:41:21
Huh? If you bought at $6k in Feb you would have made 2x your money in March. Same if you bought the dip in beginning of April you could have made 70% gains. And if you bought the dip at end of June you would have made money too. 
Not everyone bought at $20k. Also, bear markets can last years, till we rally again. So just cause we might not reach $20k this year does not mean it's done forever.

I think BTC will continue to rise over time despite whales colluding to manipulate the price. What I do see damaging though is new investors getting rekt in such a volatile market, hoping to get rich quick and not having the balls to hodl. Sure, some got out at the top, but many of those big profit takers most likely rebought low when they saw it climbing again, but then freaked out as it dumped and panic sold - losing most of their profits, if not all. 
These whales are basically taking advantage of noob investors, and making free bitcoins off them. As time goes by though, those noobs learn to just hodl, and because of this, it will slow down the whales from stealing everyone's coins by messing with their emotions. 
And I admit, I was a noob once in 2013, and let my emotions take over and lost money from trying to time the market... but screw that, I'm just leaving my crypto alone now.

But Jeff better starting thinking what will change far in the future, about 20 years, especially in the VR space, because when people start purchasing virtual goods they will not need shipping or a centralized market to buy from. They will be buying everything in a decentralized market with decentralized money, by getting entertainment, cosmetic goods, food delivery, and social media. If he doesn't enter that realm they will slowly fizzle out, while someone else develops the infrastructure to offer all those decentralized services. Point being is they better be looking at blockchain technology seriously.

Right now everytime a block is found in the network, 12.5 btc are released to miners. Those typically get sold to the market cause miners need to pay their mining costs. This can keep the price at a certain level as supply and demand find equilibrium.
When the halvening occurs (about every 4 years) the block reward gets cut in half. So in spring of 2020 is when the halvening should occur, and the block reward will drop to 6.25 btc. 
This should have an effect on price because less new coins can be sold to the market, and if there is still the same demand as today with less supply it will make it harder to purchase at lower prices - the price should rise significantly.

People can loan out bitcoin and collect an interest rate. I used to do this on Poloniex and loan 1 btc to the exchange. Since I had no reason to sell and wanted to hold long term, I might as well make free btc from interest as I hold. It's a very small interest rate, but if you keep loaning 1 btc all year you could make about around 0.03 btc for the year. But the interest rate constantly changes, so you cant calculate your return exactly for the year.

I think is foolish to think bitcoin will be the only decentralized blockchain out there. Yes, there are many clones of bitcoin's blockchain but there are also other development teams that are solving scalability issues through a different approach. Its only a matter of time until these other methods start revealing their potential in real world applications.
I think many different types of cryptocurriences will coexist along bitcoin, but I think bitcoin will still dominate that cryptocurrency market but more as a store of value, but for other ways to distribute information in a decentralized manner,  I think specific decentralized blockchains will exist.

Huh? The halvening happened in July 2016. The price doubled from May 2016 to end of Dec 2016. 6 months for it to go from $450 to over $900.  
And we all know what happened to the price in 2017.  
So it's likely we could see something similar to the price around the end of 2019 late into 2020. Its gonna be an interesting year.
@_date: 2018-08-24 05:09:57
Exactly. Bitcoin is meant to be used however people want to. If some business wants to buy $500Billion worth and own a large portion of bitcoins and then offer for sale to whoever they want, as whatever they want, they can (if its legal), because some small guy can also buy $100 and do what they want with it, cause they are allowed to.
SO. Your keys, your bitcoin. Custodians keys, THEIR bitcoin. Who are we to say who is allowed to buy bitcoin, ETFs have just the right as we do - but we should educate to buy bitcoin directly so people can hold their own keys.

How does this not ring a bell? It's volatile because we are at the very early stages of it being adopted - this is a good sign that it's volatile because it means you are lucky to get in early and just hold until it becomes widely adopted. There is no way bitcoin could be stable right now with such small liquidity, considering the WHOLE world is involved in it.
If bitcoin does become a very successful currency (which I believe it will be in one form or another) it will be much less volatile, but super expensive to convert into. People will be using the currency, not really investing into as a get rich quick/manipulate/day trade kind of way. The swings will only be a couple percent a year, and most likely will go up. 
New investments (tokens) will be all the rage in the future that we will use BTC to buy. Stocks will become a form of cryptocurrency, and people will trade bitcoin between them. When your investment moons you will have made BTC. Fiat will slowly die out like many analog devices are today.

Isn't this what makes bitcoin so powerful, is that its *decentralized*? It's very difficult to find one central weakness to destroy it. This is not like the Death Star in Star Wars, where all it takes is one engineer to make a design flaw to destroy it. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:40:17
But it was not easy to hold through all the crashes. Imagine having $50k the first round and it drops to $6k. You're like ahhh damn, I'm selling next time it gets there. You do, but then find out you could have had millions. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:36:41
*5 years later, bitcoin reaches $80k and crashes to $40k.*
I told a friend to invest in Dec 17, and they didn't listen to me and totally ignored BTC after that. Sadly, he waited and bought in at $78k.

Excellent news! Time to sell.
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:12:15
Why not just buy $10k worth now? If bitcoin went to $1 it went there for a reason and probably has less of a chance going up to $1.1, $2, $3. 
You have a better chance of bitcoin going up to $10k, $15k, $30k now.

When you go long you are doing the opposite, but you are borrowing cash this time not coins. You still get hit with an interest rate and are betting the price will shoot up. If it does, you can now close your position, selling the coin and paying back the loan and collecting the profits.
I'm not sure exactly how exchanges balance the books, to make it so there are equal longs and shorts, but maybe they use their own funds, to allow a buyer to take out a loan or borrow a coin. 
But from what it sounds like, it's difficult to find an exchange, or any exchange for that matter to go long short like my examples, but the idea of what I'm explaining is how it works.

Do you really want to drive down a neighborhood with 100s of QR codes all over the place because up and coming artists need support?
I fully support the mechanism of easily handing out tips digitally to support the work of artists by using QR codes, but because it's so simple, everyone can spam the streets with QR codes hoping to get as much exposure as they can. There will be amazing artwork and terrible work, but because it's so easy to make money off it, which some will do, it will promote many artists to follow this same mechanism. So that's what I mean by taking advantage of it - taking advantage of the simplicity of getting tips from QR codes, I could see it just getting out of control.
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:31:32

Do you know how much is at stake here with bitcoin's code - yea, $8500 per btc, yes that's around $150 billion in market cap, and its been analyzed for more than 8 years from the public.
Do you not think the brightest, most talented hackers, programmers, looked into any malicious code to where if they solved it could benefit from it or short the shit out of the currency then release the flaw and become insanely rich? 
You are underestimating the power of the other side to want to reap off the rewards for bitcoin failing, not everyone wants it to succeed. It would be a very poor conspiracy to allow the whole world to use it, dissect it, analyze it, and hope they just accept it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:05:21

Sorry to burst your bubble, but if you bought bitcoin a couple years ago it did not go up, it crashed pretty hard, no use looking for it.

People are people. The govt isnt some evil group of lizard men, trying to come up with some plan to destroy everything. It's quite obvious the world is embracing cryptocurrencies, it's just they are trying to balance how they will work with it, but they will never be able to destroy it.
If they truly wanted to destroy it, they would have before it even got to $100. Why would they allow it to flourish to $20,000 and get everyone aware of it? The govt has power to stop technological ideas before mainstream can understand it. If conspiracies are real, then they are extremely stupid to allow the internet to develop! The BIGGEST threat to conspiraces is knowledge/freedom of thinking and sharing with others, why give that to the people? The cat is out of the bag now - they would be very, very stupid if they are conspiring to destroy it and just started now.

This. We will see a small dip before the big bull run happens. It's all manipulated.
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:34:22
Why does it matter if it drops from a high? As long as it keeps going up from adoption over time, the only people who get burned are the ones too weak to hold or fomo the shit out of it and then panic sell. 
I made an investment and will sit on it for 10+ years, as then I will be using some of that savings for important things I have planned in the future. I can care less about it having wild swings. If it continues to rise - good, if it starts to drop year after year than I will be paying more attention to why people are pulling out of bitcoin - and maybe it might be a good time to reinvest that money elsewhere.
So far bitcoin has performed very well  for everyone that took a risk a year ago. The others that got in on the high just need to be patient and realize this is an investment, not a get rich quick - lambo - retire early, type gamble - they just need to hold as it slowly climbs back up to $20k.

Because the markets are unregulated. Bitcoins liquidity is low, so it is easy to manipulate, and bitcoin is still new, the big players hold most the coins and have learned how to move the market in their direction.
Also there has already been proof that "pump n dump" groups exist to manipulate alt coins, why would bitcoin not be treated the same?

Totally agree with you. Definitely rough for your dad, and there is really nothing you can say that will give "true" hope. Personally, I am a holder. Like you said though, only invest what you can afford to lose. Ironically, I was up 300-1000% all through 2017 - never sold. I kept buying the dips all in 2018, lots of alts, which were damn high compared to now. I am now actually under by about 1/4th my portfolio cause I bought much higher. It's all money I can lose.... but fuck me, this is seriously destroying some people right now.

More like get rich ~~quick~~ because we have a deep understanding of where the tech will go, and how we can handle the volatility because we are not impatient but can hold for years. 
The people who want to get rick quick are the ones most susceptible to when it crashes, drops, corrects, call it what you want, but they are the ones feeling the most emotion, and are going to miss out on the true potential and reward btc has to offer right now.

By the time bitcoin is very expensive over $1 million a coin, volatility will have decreased drastically, so when you spend your mBTC you dont really worry about it going 20x in a year, more like 1-3%. To some people it will promote saving, cause they will gain a little, and also it will slow down people from rushing out and wasting all their money on useless crap, then needing help from the govt when shit hits the fan because they can't afford food - they may want to save a little which can help them in emergencies.

We obviously have two different perspectives of what huge risk means. 
Playing the lottery with $10,000 to win the jackpot is a huge risk. 
Investing into a new technology that has so much potential to change how we use money may seem like a risk now cause it's difficult to understand how it will work in the future, but that's why the more you understand it the more it makes sense that this is where the future will ultimately lead to. In my opinion I think it's a HUGE risk NOT to own any bitcoin, it actually scares the crap out of me if I do not have any.

Sometimes things are priced higher so that if you can afford it, you are in an elite group, separating yourself from the average person. 
Why do you think some people pay $300 for jeans with some logo that stands out? Because they want to show off they have money, and are more successful than the average Joe paying $30 for the same type of jeans without the logo. 
Good luck going to a party where everyone is superficial and cares about money rather than a "better deal, more bang for their buck", they can give two shits if you try to argue with them that a certain item is overpriced. As long as it has the symbol that glows "I have money and am successful and you can't afford this product so I'm better than you" they can care less if it's a good deal or not.

When you short, you borrow someone else's coin, then sell it instantly and try to rebuy it back cheaper and give the coin back to the person - profiting the difference in price.The catch is, you pay interest while holding that sold coin, so from the start you are already losing. 
In a basic example, say you borrow a lenders coin at $10k, you sell it. You are now holding $10k ready to rebuy cheaper, but you only have $5k collateral in your account (meaning you can only lose up to $5k of your money). Now the coin goes up to $11-12-13-14k. Once it hits $15k the exchange will close your position, **forcing** you to buy the coin at $15k, taking your $5k collateral (you lose $5k **plus** the interest holding the coin you sold.) 
So, bottom line is, when you short, you sell other people's coins, betting the price to go down to rebuy it cheaper and make the difference.

It will take time, a long time 10+ years until items are solely priced in BTC. 
There will be a shift from speculation of price/investing to real world use. By that time the price will be much higher, many people will have adopted it and people will not look at it as a get rich quick investment cause price will only go up a couple % a year and volatility will be much lower - stable enough to be a currency.
Kids will ask their parents/grandparents what it was like when BTC was dirt cheap, and how come you didn't buy as many as you could, cause the price is 100s of times higher now.

Dang really? I didn't know some employers made it mandatory to direct deposit, I would think it would be a law that all employers must give the option to offer a check, so the employee can just cash it at their bank in case they don't have a bank account or even want a bank account, cause of the fees associated with them.
In that case, I find it pretty messed up that a bank, which offers a service is a mandatory requirement from certain employers. People need jobs, there are laws agaisnt discrimination, im shocked there arnt laws to protect the working class for how they receive their money.
As for higher limits, there is the option to use a cashier's check, (yes there is a fee to purchase one) but in this case you still do not need a bank.

I'm a little confused. If the person shorting has $5k collateral, and the exchange will liquidate at a certain percentage of that, won't the exchange just automatically buy the coin at the higher price with the shorter's $5k USD and pay back the coin to the lender? Isn't that the guarantee, that the exchange already has extra funds locked up to buy the coin when it shoots up?

There is nothing wrong with being scared. I have been underwater too with my money, and yes it's an nerveracking feeling. I'm not saying it's guaranteed it will break $20k I'm just saying this same feeling has come and gone at least 30 times throughout btc's history - so why is this one the final blow? There is no bad news that has come out. IMO this drop is because of CME shorting. They had the perfect opportunity to capitalize on the high price of BTC. In the long run I think it's very likely btc will climb back up and surpass 20k in 2018, and continue on with big drops, at the even higher price point. Just don't let emotions play a part in your investing strategy, set a goal and stick with it.

Not when you have to pay taxes on it. Say you hold $10 of BTC and BTC goes sideways for 3 years, but only adjusts to inflation, lets say 8%. So now you have BTC worth $10.80. You sell and have to pay taxes on $0.80 (-$0.08, long term gains, 10%), so you end up with $10.72. Cool you're up 72 cents profit. Then you go buy a burger and (in this case) costs 8% more than it did 3 years ago due to inflation. It was $10 before now its $10.80 and you only have $10.72. No burger for you, you just got robbed.

That's true. But after an ETF is approved and investment firms start buying up all the bitcoins - investors won't have access to the protocol, just the stock. Overtime majority of people wont care to buy "real" btc and the high price will incentivize your btc holder to sell to the firms.

@_date: 2018-10-13 22:33:23
This is the way I look at it. Bitcoin was an experiment from Satoshi. He did not make the "perfect" coin from the start but rather an experiment for a brand new commodity and a new market - crypto currencies.
Because of this new invention there have been many, many new ideas, new coins, new blockchains. Pandora's box is open now and there is a greater chance a better coin takes over, solving the initial problems to adoption.
The truth is, change is the only thing that is constant - meaning our society will change, and adopt whatever naturally works. We all know how bitcoin works, we all know it has a high value currently and we all hope the rest of the world will be compelled to put their wealth into it - but that may never happen the way we expect it to.
People say crypto moves faster than any other tech. Well then let's step back for a second. Bitcoin is 10 years old - so does that mean its actually much older than we think it is? We are entering a crypto 2.0 age with many new coins that could lead the way for real adoption in a more practical way. To ignore alts, is just as ignorant to ignore bitcoin when bitcoin was only a couple years old. That means, there absolutely may be other coins that do increase in value significantly because they are truly adopted and not speculated on. 
The only way to catch the winning ticket is research, being unbiased, open minded, patient and NOT following the herd - invest in what YOU truly believe will work and will make a difference.
@_date: 2018-10-10 04:47:11

There has to be some extra cost of energy associated with mining gold. Cause if it costs the exact same amount of energy to mine silver as gold, every mining business would mine gold. 
I'm not talking the mechanics of mining the gold but the resources, like using employees to create deals with jurisdictions to get permits to mine, and research, and tools to locate better areas to mine gold. 
Everything balances out in the end, and that is how businesses become efficient utilizing their energy to acquire more energy. So while that business mines silver, they use less energy to mine it than gold, but the end result might pay the same to gold.

Correct. But for a protocol to thrive it needs to be adopted. I'm not speaking price here, just the utility. Bitcoin will be used based on how the masses see it.

There's a huge difference in knowing what it is and thinking its "stupid" vs knowing what it is and coming up with a rational reason as to why the challenges it faces are too great that it will not succeed. Stupid comes from ignorance and knowing what bitcoin is, is the opposite of ignorance. 
Bitcoin is a very smart invention that has a huge potential to become adopted throughout the world as a currency. It has the fundamentals of the laws of the universe - math. It has a lot of challenges to overcome which may hold it back or it may lead the way to another cryptocurrency that will dominate some currencies. But you can't call it stupid and understand it at the same time. That's like learning about calculus and saying, blah this is stupid, no need for math at this level of complexity.
@_date: 2018-06-29 22:59:05
Yea, I think its good regardless because there are still options to buy the coin from an exchange. The more exposure btc has to investors the better imo. I  would love an ETF option so companies can offer 401k plans to employees investing in bitcoin, while also matching a %. 
I for one would gladly take that option if I had a company that offered it, and matched my contribution.

@_date: 2018-06-13 21:11:13
Sorry, but I'm lost. Why do you say supply will increase to ~900btc a day, when today it is ~1800btc? How do you increase an amount by supplying less? 
The way I look at it is, miners need to sell, so there is constant selling pressure regardless of price. So theoretically if demand wants, say, 100btc a day and miners can sell 100btc the price will stay flat. If tmr demand is still 100 btc and miners can only sell 50 btc, the other 50btc will need to come from hodlers, and they will most likely take a much higher offer than the avg price. This should raise the price, but again if demand stays the same.

I am mostly into btc and hold a few alts. But if you look at the trend, when the market comes back up, alts gain more to btc. Look at the charts and you will see that you are selling alts "low" for btc. But in the end it depends on the alts that you are selling. If they had a history of being much higher I would just wait it out a week and sell when they go higher.

Manipulation. If some group is trying to suppress the price of bitcoin to get retail investors out so they can buy cheap, they dump hard on obvious bad news. This makes people panic as they think its a real cause to sell. 
Then when good news comes out people think, oh its going to moon and then see the price doesn't go up much cause its suppressed. They lose faith and get out, becoming conditioned that bitcoin is sorta dead and it won't go up anymore.
When millions is at stake a some groups have the power to manipulate the market, they definitely have an agenda, and they know the psychology of how rookie investors act, so they play them. This is why hodl is very important, so you dont get caught up in the game.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:27:31
Exactly! This is what I tell myself everyday. The only way it would have worked is if you forgot about it and never checked the price.
I had a good chunk of ETH and saw it rise to $400, was up a very large amount - then watched it go back to $130. Sure it is back up, I am happy, but I still tell myself If I would have sold I would have been able to buy a ton more of ETH.
It's soooo easy to look at the past and say, oh if you bought $1 worth you would be rich! But at ANY moment on it's climb it could have dropped and never reached a new ATH!
The reality is - Bitcoin is just a very successful coin, and if you held and watched the price you took a HUGE risk to not cash out.

It really shows how ignorant people are to bitcoin when they constantly compare a business to a decentralized cryptocurrency.
In a centralized business all it takes is one idiot sitting on the board to propose a stupid idea and have everyone agree on it. Then the competition swoops in and steals the spotlight. Bitcoin just exists, it doesn't need to hire the latest talent and filter resumes, fire people, market to a target audience, deal with being politically correct, manage its budget, operate efficiently with all their organizations. Bitcoin is a whole new animal that has never existed before and that's what makes it so exciting. The more research you do the more it becomes clear how big it will become in the future.

Yup, cause all the people who took profits at $4k and havent bought back in are sitting pretty, eh? They are stressing to decide when the bottom is if they want to get back in, while I just hodl and go on with my life from being a hodler since pre $2k and still have the same amount of coins.
If you are *truly* in it for the long run 5+ years, just hodl through all this noise. If not, then test your luck at timing the market.

The "gains and losses" are just a by-product to the adoption of bitcoin. You shouldn't be looking at it like buying and selling bitcoin but rather converting into bitcoin to use - just right now it's not fully ready to be used and that's ok cause its slowly evolving to become adopted and used mainstream so for now it's a long term hold - cause it will continue to go up.
Bitcoin was not created to be a day trading asset to get rich and convert back to fiat then to have the next guy buy and hold then sell to next guy at a higher price. Bitcoin is designed to be a currency in one form or the other in the future. It just so happens we are lucky to get in now and convert fiat to bitcoin cheap, and then have a large amount of purchasing power in the future. Bitcoin will eventually level out and not be volatile to where there is a "risk" to lose money. Kids 20 years from now will not look at bitcoin as a get rich investment but just normal currency, but they will look back and say: "oh my god, you could get 1 bitcoin for less than a car??? 1 bitcoin now will buy you a mansion on the beach, I wish I was alive back then".

I'm with you. I too believe $100k is a stretch and definitely in the realm of dreaming, just hoping. But witnessing BTC go from $150 - $1200 my very first time in 2013 with it right in front of my eyes, I couldn't believe it. Then the second time seeing it go from $600 to $20k right in front of my eyes truly made me say...what the fuck! So imagining it going to $100k, while it does seem highly unlikely, it just wouldn't surprise me and am definitely prepared for it this time :) 
Who knows, it could be the end, but seeing the pattern repeat with each bubble since the birth of bitcoin, I think I would have worse odds trying to guess when the pattern will end. 
If I were to truly put a bet down and go through with a prediction to $100k I would say sometime before 2022.

Well I had a similar experience, and not to freak you out but it took 1 year to resolve. Yes, 1 year! 
Although I was pissed I had to wait one year, it did benefit me. I purchased 1 eth in May 2017 for like $170. It never went through and showed pending. I went back and forth, maybe 15 times with customer support. They just couldn't seem to understand the problem. I created screenshots, gave all my details from my bank (it was a purchase from my checking acct.) And had to explain it over and over as clear as possible. They then told me I used the credit card I had on file and it failed to go through, that's why I didn't get the coin. I was very confused, cause even though I did have a credit card on file, I never used it for any purchases. I had full proof the $170 was deducted from my bank account. I was very upset.
Anyway. Just recently did they figure it out and credited me the coin which is now over $500 so I'm a little happy there. But it was frustrating when eth went to $1400.

I remember trading on Binance back in early Sept. When I withdrew some ether they didn't calculate the gas correctly and my transaction failed. It sat in limbo for over a week and I was freaking out trying to get a hold of customer support. I was convinced they were a cheap, scammy exchange. They eventually resolved it. But looking back, I would have never guessed they would dominate the exchange market. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 23:01:26
And it's a fact that you are just making up numbers that sound good to you. You have no evidence about any of this to be "highly possible" and "hodlers are retiring their coins"
The truth is, 1800 bitcoins are added to the supply a day, and some miners are forced to sell - there is a constant downward pressure from selling. So as long as the price stays higher than the bottom for the year, there is more demand to buy bitcoin than sell, which means more coins are being held.  
@_date: 2018-06-28 17:50:00

Thanks for the link, however I already know most of that. But basically what I said in my last comment is exactly what was said in the article; so, I am not sure why you said the supply would increase to 900btc on the next halving, it actually decreases to 900btc from 1800btc. And if demand stays the same price should increase. Not saying its guaranteed, but the halving does favor a price increase rather than a drop.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:48:53
It's not so much that people "worry" about their money being confiscated it's about how the younger generation undetstands that they can choose an alternative currency now, like bitcoin.
Word gets around near lightspeed thanks to the internet. Just like now, there is a movement happening where the younger generation wants freedom, transparency,  decentralized, and bitcoin is offering that. I would rather bank on what the future generation wants than just assume they will follow an older, outdated monetary system. 
The only thing that is constant in the universe is change; money will change, and it already looks like we have a glimpse of what it will change into.

I understand why we each have our own perspective and this is why bitcoin is a risk, cause it can go either way. I just happen to lean more towards it will be successful long term and you dont. 
But you got to understand that if bitcoin was clear enough that it were to succeed, and that everyone did want it right now it would be way too late for us little guys to make big profits, the institutions will have beaten us to it. That's why its smart to buy when it seems everyone in retail doesn't believe in it. Sure in the end, bitcoin might fail, I can acknowledge that, and you should acknowledge that it might succeed, but its still a smart buy to get some relatively low now, rather than be a laggard and buy when it seems safe.
I can accept that I might lose some money in the end, but I already consider that gone, so I dont stress out. But can you accept if bitcoin does take off huge, that you missed a big opportunity that was starring at you right in front of your face?
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:56:25
Absolutley. Miners are bringing in ~~~18,000~~ 1,800  bitcoins a day. Some might hold a portion and the rest might sell all at once to constantly take a profit. 
Efficient miners have a low break even price, so even if they sell now they make a profit. But at the end of the day some are forced to sell to keep paying their overhead costs to continue mining. There is constantly a downward pressure from miners selling, so as the price of bitcoin stays constant or moves up, that is a good sign as it indicates there is enough demand.

From what I thought, the broker offering the ETF has to hold btc to offer the ETF. So say, they buy 100,000 btc and offer ETFs to their clients. But then tons of people want more btc than they hold. They then have to manage how much more btc to buy to offer to their clients, then let's say everyone cashes out their btc ETF, that broker will sell off a portion of their btc holdings on the market to recoup the payments they made to their clients.
I assume the brokers take on the risk holding a certain % of bitcoin to always offer some for sale to clients. They will manage the assets, and collect fees from clients. This is the tricky part for running the business when you want to make a profit. But as clients will be buying, selling their btc shares, the broker will act like an exchange by holding enough liquidity, to fulfill orders. The only difference here, is the clients don't physically control the btc, and have no risk from hackers. 
The crypto market is just beginning to take off in the institutional side. Once regulations, and confidence is put in, many services should pop up making is much more accessible and safe for big investors to jump in, which could ultimately lead btcs price very high.
This is my understanding, on how these ETFs will work, so please dont take this as fact. Someone please correct me if what I think is way off.

I get it. There is a whole lot of *uncertainty* with bitcoin. The way I look at it is, by the time *certainty* comes, and an argument can easily hold weight and becomes apparent that btc is safe to invest in, it will be way too late to make big profits. 
While bitcoin doesn't clearly show it's true power, there are a lot of investors who understand it's a work in progress with a ton of potential and are taking it on.
Its highly speculative, it could fail, it's not easy seeing how it will overcome all its challenges, but because of this, it's what gives any person the opportunity to invest in something that could be one of the biggest opportunities in their lifetime. Does everyone need to take this chance? No, and nothing will hurt them if they don't. Even if bitcoin becomes extremely successful, the only disadvantage to them is getting less btc for a much higher price.  While I get your point that it is taking a while to become what it's designed to be, there is no race, there really is no board controlling bitcoin, constantly trying to outdo the competition like a business. There is no control in it that some group *should* do something to it, and that's the beauty of its decentralized nature. It exists without any central authority, but how the whole world wants to value it - it will become whatever it becomes organically. The code can update, but if it forks like we've seen then the market will decide what to value, not a central organization.

If demand stays relatively the same from now till 2020 and the block reward gets cut in half, supply will drop by half increasing the price on the market cause of less coins available and less selling pressure from miners.
Nothing is guaranteed, but it's pretty simple to understand why the price would shoot up.

Here's an idea: 
Take a picture of the Lego Lambo partially built once a day based on the price of bitcoin. Each day, add some pieces or remove some pieces as bitcoin goes up and down. Looking at the details of this Lego Lambo on Amazon, it has 741 pieces. Let's set the Lambo price to $200,000. So out of all the 741 pieces, each piece will be worth $270 which will total up to $200,000 when all the pieces are put together. Each day at a certain time add or remove pieces based on the price. So, starting today with btc at $7400, there would be 27 pieces put together.
In a timelapse video, we should slowly see the Lambo being built. Once btc reaches $200,000, the Lambo will be fully constructed! If the price drops you will see the Lambo slowly break apart, as your dreams vanish away. 
The goal in the end is 1 btc = 1 Lambo
Edit: wrote it better.

@_date: 2018-06-23 06:35:30
The way I see it is, we need buyers and we dont have enough. And who is selling? Miners. They add 1800 bitcoins a day to the supply. Some of them have to sell to recoup their operation costs, so there is ALWAYS selling pressure. As the price gets low, they cant afford to hold all their mined coins, so they have to sell. When they are making coins at 3x profit, they can afford to hold more, and sell a little off to pay for costs. 
Once the halving happens in 2020, the supply will go to 900btc a day, which will reduce the selling pressure by half and allow for the price to increase if demand is high.

They are only getting rewarded now cause we are in a bear market. When the bull market starts up, they will sell on the first dip and get caught when it shoots up 15% in one day. They will start losing coins, and continue to chase the price, failing when it pumps each time. Sure there are "good" traders that can sense the direction its going and will do well, but majority of these panic sellers are going to get rekt in a bull run.

Because we are not really in currency mode yet. The infrastructure is being built right now, and the thing to do is acquire as much btc as you can now for the future. In the future btc will be very expensive, and the ability to use it as a currency will be much more user friendly with many merchants accepting it.
Sure if you want you can spend it now, but it's not that convenient, because it's not widely adopted nor does it have  enough liquidity to be a stable currency.
But as we can see, the growth of bitcoin has been steadily going up since it was created. It will continue to do this until it levels out when it's mostly adopted.

Think of it this way. You might be religious or not, so let's not turn this into a debate about religion itself, but there are a lot of people who don't believe in God despite a book being around for thousands of years with writing that talks about God with all the proof you need. The arguement comes down to, but have you met God, how do you know God exists? How do you know God looks like a man with a white beard?
Well, people say because the book says so, plus you have to have faith to believe in him, and then there are stories of experiences where people saw God. So that is all the proof you need right?
So again, you believe Satoshi is human 100% and not anything else? Because he wrote in a forum, with words, thst would be similar to a book? Does this at all sound familiar?

Correct, and while they may not make 1% off people who are responsible with credit, they sure do make up for it with the 12-28% interest rate from the irresponsible. Give enough people free money, with cash back bonuses and you are sure to make more off interest than losing to the cash back.

It makes bitcoin legitimate, and can be traded on the stock market. Basically it will give confidence to all the big investors and bring huge amounts of money in.

Depends on the exchange and how they define "sell".
For example, Coinbase considers a sell when you move your coin out of the exchange to a wallet - basically any coin that moves out of the exchange is a sell, and any coin that moves into the exchange is a buy, regardless if it was converted to fiat or not.

To you nobody knew what btc was before 2017. There has been a huge following before then. Lots of ups and downs with a lot of money being thrown around. While it's true majority of the price above $5k could be from mainstream retail investors, I still think the price can rise despite them. It just shows however if a strong support level is created above $15k-$20k without mainstream, just imagine what mainstream will do to the price. It could easily push another bubble to $100k.

That really made me laugh. I was in bitcoin during the winter 2013 bubble. There were about 5 of us, including me that bought above $800 and ended up losing money in beginning of 2014. We talked about bitcoin here and there in 2015, 2016 and always thought, wow what a fad its never coming back up.
Guess what we all did when bitcoin broke $1500-$2000 as well as $10,000?

That is ridiculous. You think people who want to "play" with bitcoin and just figure it out will want to fork over 12% off the bat. So you play with  $100 it costs $12 - that is just stupid. 
Just because it went up does not justify the high fee. What if it went down, would you still say, the 12% is ok, and you should hodl? So you're now down $12 plus the loss of the coin.

I would say at least 70% of people give two shits about really understanding the tech and reading about its progress. If you do a ton of research you will find that bitcoin is gaining more support, awareness, adoption than it ever has, and the $20k price was just due to everyone **FOMOing** - not the actual status of bitcoin itself.
People think that $20k meant the world was at its peak adoption, business everywhere accepted it, countries were dancing around in joy with bitcoin, but as soon as it dumped they all believe it died. Like, people stopped supporting it, all the businesses gave up on it, countries hate bitcoin now. Truth is, it's the opposite, its grown more than it ever has, and *so far* its price seems to be around $6k holding for 8 months, which in the history of bitcoin is DAMN AMAZING!
So yea, price is a horrible way to measure its success when it goes into a huge bubble. People need to look at its history and do research to realize bitcoin is still trucking along just fine. I mean let's be real, imagine if bitcoin never went into fomo mode and it only peaked at $10k and it was sitting at $6.5k, there would be a totally different attitude - but it's still $6.5k. So always just take into account the FOMO price does not indicate its health - it just means the price was way ahead of it's time and it might take a year to stabilize at $20k. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:39:19
Yea I agree. I think it's just gonna take time until the tech finally catches up for dominate mainstream application. Bitcoin will mature with different groups of adoption in each bubble.

Well this time we are all holding because we believe in it more. Doesn't mean it will work out be we are all keeping our coins even if it's in a bear market for a while.
Yea a lot more money went in this bubble, but there was "a lot" of money relative to the time in dec. 2013 that was put in, and many people got burned. Bitcoin was slightly mainstream then as it was in news articles, (not as big now, but still caught many peoples attention). 
How did the market recover in 2017? How did majority of followers feel comfortable even touching bitcoin again? I think the big push was other factors, which then made the original buyers fomo back in, plus new people of course.
If this time other factors push btc above $20k, I think many who are non believers now, are gonna jump back in, but pushing BTC to an incredible new high. But of course the question is, what is going to drive btc up again. I personally think it will be the halving, and institutions. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:15:13
Those are institutions demoing to their investors. "See I attempted to make 235k BTC, but Bitcoin rejected it. This is proof how secure it is. Now are you guys ready to purchase those 250k btc?

@_date: 2018-06-29 05:08:49
I think the halving will have a huge factor for another bubble. 
If we go off history, the first halving happened on Nov 28th 2012, at $12. In 5 months it exploded to $200, then another 7 months to $1200.
On July 9th 2016 the second halving at a price of $652. It took 6 months to get  back to around its all time high ever at  ~$1100. 11 months later it reached $20k.
I know the halving wont guarantee a huge bubble again, but I think so far from the trend, it shows a pattern, so there is a good chance the halving in 2020 will push btc much higher than ever before.
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:23:16
Yes. The way I look at it is, miners are constantly selling in the market. When the block reward gets cut in half, they can now only sell half of what they could sell before from mining. That's a huge drop in supply in the market. 
However, this effect on price only works if there is still the same demand.
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:15:13
So back in dec 2013 when it spiked from $100 - $1200 in a matter of 6 months and the bubble popped after all the crazy hype from it being all over the front news people realized there was no need for it, correct?
But why Is it now worth over $7000? It just doesn't make sense. Back then people figured out there was no need for it. But now, ugh... I mean, this time there REALLY is no need for it.
Maybe, just maybe there actually **IS** demand for it. But who knows, I guess well just have to wait and see :)
Dont stress your mind out too much when it breaks $20k and goes on another bull run.

I think if you try to use TA on your own without anyone else following your prediction then your TA prediction has no effect on the market. But as soon as you share your TA results with 1000s of people you just made a whole new dynamic that will ruin your prediction.
Its like going back in time and buying 10,000 bitcoins at $1 each to find out it crashes to zero and doge coin goes to $20k - you just affected the future with your given knowledge.
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:26:39
People think when it was $10 it was easy and quick to make $20,000 per coin in 7 years. So when they bought the dip at $10k and saw it go to $6k in 3 months they freaked out. "Wheres my moon, the $100k coin I was promised? This is way too painful and risky" That $10 coin was probably the hardest thing to hold all the way to $2-$20-$100-$1k-$5k-$10k-$20k 
But when you step back and look at the long term trend, there is some truth to the hodl meme. So a $6k coin in 7 years may be a fortune, why not give it a chance and see what happens in 7 years.

It's called control. When someone likes something but wants the strip the fundamentals of what created it they want to control the driving force and skew it to their benefit, usually by profiting off it. 
This is why so many original ideas start off underground, cool, weird, and then when big business sees all the attention they get their grubby hands all over it and ruin it. Like Andrea Antonopoulos said in one of his speeches, bitcoin is weird, and businesses are trying to steal it and strip the weird away from it. But it's not going to happen this time cause of the decentralized nature.

Bitcoin is whatever anyone wants it to be. Investment, black market, transparency, security, etc...
Bitcoin is designed to be used for whatever people want to use it for without anyone telling them what to do with it. So the default purpose is to not have a purpose and to just exist by what anyone wants to use it for. Right now people give it value, and we only measure that value to a currency, cause one of the simplest ways to acquire it is through trading fiat for it or you can take the other approach and mine it. The beauty of bitcoin is no one truly knows what it will become, and that is the most exciting thing, because like I said, it just exists, so there really is no easy way to predict the future with it, but what we do know is there are only ever gonna be 21mil. So if the demand across the world rises to extreme heights, 1btc is gonna be a fortune.

So what? Bitcoin doesn't care, it just exists, it will become whatever it becomes, there is no controlling it.
Bitcoin did not force anyone with a family to put their life savings into it and go broke. Bitcoin is not designed to take advantage of anyone, its people's own greed that attracts them to insane gains. Just like millions of people around the world that lose money to gambling, they just want to become rich quick, and that is their OWN fault, not bitcoin's.
If you do the research youll see that there is a very strong fundamental to why bitcoin is such a high price, and has so much potential to go higher in value. Maybe this is just the way nature works, by weeding out the ignorant, greedy people that want to take shortcuts in life, and reward patient people who take their time reading and understanding that these bubbles are just the nature of bitcoin and it will continue to go up. 
When bitcoin breaks a new ATH there will be many who are confused and even more mad that they were weak enough to get out, its gonna get ugly, but also a whole new manic phase with people fomoing like crazy. 
Moral of the story: invest only what you are *comfortable* losing, DYOR, be patient, and take responsibility of your actions as bitcoin can't care less about you.

To access the wallet, you log in with your Twitter credentials and it links to the wallet, so technically they own those credentials, so then they own that wallet.

Bitcoin is not going to continue to go up 100% each year, once it reaches a state where majority have adopted it, it might only grow 1% a year.

Just curious. How often did you get paid, and did you only hold btc and never sell it? 
I ask because surely there were months/weeks when you got more btc cause it was low and then the price went up so you made a profit if you sold. Unless you had the worst luck and you got paid at each high, and had to sell on every low then, yea, you definitely got screwed. But in the end, I understand that regardless, since we are in a bear market, you mostly averaged a loss.

Depends on the game you're playing. Example, Nickel-Quarter slots rarely have cocktail waitress coming back, and why did you tip $5? $1 is enough to keep them coming back every 15mins or so. 
But it really does come down to the casino, games, and how busy it is. I play craps / min $5 with $100 bankroll, and can play for about 1 hour and get at least 4  beers in me. After a good buzz get some liquor in there and you can keep the buzz going.  Going to a bar I'm guaranteed to spend at least $25 on the 4 drink including the tips, and have no chance of winning anything.

The odds of bitcoin repeating past trends greatly outweigh the odds of it stopping. Sure, there is no guarantee it will go back up, but since we have seen many bubbles repeat in the history of bitcoin it would actually be harder to guess when bitcoin will stop repeating the pattern.

I understand that income needs to be reported just like cash. 
But in this case, Twitter users are receiving income and I would argue 99.99% are not reporting it. Half probably dont know they even have access to it, then some do but probably dont know how to withdrawal it, and some know how to cash it out. 
Where is the line drawn for when receiving digital income that you didnt "know you received it", "know how to spend it"? Also if you do know how can it be proven you do?

Back then people could go to a local PC store and buy tons of data from CDs. Many people did not want to wait and download. The internet back then had typical PC stuff, it's no where near like today. You had to be a PC nerd to find the good stuff. So the average people could go to their PC shop once a week and get the latest stuff. Driving to the store to get 3 CDs of 700mb each would be much faster than downloading 2.1gb of data using dial up. 
My point being is people could gauge the speed of the internet.
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:37:13
The bottom for the year was like $5800. As long as it stays above that it means there is still healthy demand. If the price were to keep dropping under each new low for the year ($5500 - $5000 - $4500 etc..) then that is a bad sign as demand is very low and hodlers are selling. So I would say we have been in an uptrend ever since it bottomed out at $5800. 
Now imagine when the halving happens in 2020 and only 900 btc are released a day, if demand is the same, the price will rise much faster.

Bitcoin is not as business so you can't compare it to that. What can you compare bitcoin to? Nothing, because its the first tech ever to function like this.


Just because it spiked to $20k for a short amount of time and came down does not indicate anything about it going to zero, since the functionality of bitcoin has not changed at all.  Over it's long term growth it is trending upward. If the average shifted and it declined for more than 10 years, I would lean more towards that it may be heading to $0. 


It does not need to *grow* users or it dies. It can keep the same users right now and continue to go up in price, it won't die. Volatility is just low volume. It could be volatile forever and stay around a certain price.


If it hits $1, I will remember you, when it breaks $20k remember me. Also, I won't be getting a lambo, more like a Tesla ;)

There's nothing to argue. It's a fact that you nor anyone has ever met Satoshi based off any evidence so far. No one can say for certain that Satoshi actually even created bitcoin or a human did it.
Most likely the odds of it being him, a human, greatly surpass any other theory, but I'm gonna stick to the technicalities of my original comment and say that we only "think" Satoshi is a human who created it. I'm not gonna spit out nonsense of what I believe he is, because that's irrelevant, but the only information we have is his writing in a paper and forum, which is factually all there is. 
And slightly off topic, one other thing I think many people need to start paying attention to are bots which are becoming much more advanced on the internet. They are learning how people communicate which leads them to being capable of having conversations online, that are indistinguishable to humans. How do you know I'm a real person talking to you?

@_date: 2019-06-30 07:47:05
Depends if you make capital gains or not. 
Think of it like this. You buy 1 BTC in Nov 2018 for $3500. Then today (June 2019) you go use your card and buy a $13,500 purchase with that 1 BTC. You are taxed on $10,000. That $10,000 tax rate will be determined by your income. So if you are in a high tax bracket you could have to pay 30-40% on that ( $3,000 - $4,000).
Now it could go the other way and can claim a loss, like if you bought at $20k and then bought something for $15k, but again it's all affected by your tax bracket.
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:46:32
And just like that, everyone started bidding and the last guy stopped at $5800.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:40:26
Yes they are both risks, but I think its *more* of a risk and foolish to stay in 100% fiat when so far the trend is showing bitcoin constantly going up. Why take the higher risk to not own any. A small amount of btc may go a long way vs losing a little fiat, when majority of the currency held is fiat anyway. It's not like losing a little fiat will make it extremely hard to get it back - unlike bitcoin it may be extremely hard to purchase it back as it might go up significantly. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:26:11

OK ok.... It's easy to say that now because it has gone up significantly. And I am a full supporter of it continuing to go up. But there is a chance it can go down. If, it does go way down, under $1000, think of all the people Hodling and others saying. How many clues did I need as it was going down to get out.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:45:47
Maybe the chart is working. Everyone who is buying/hodling is speculating the price to be higher than they bought. If everyone contributes to this then the price is on a perfect trajectory.

You can't say "percentages aside". Because percentages are what make it a big difference or not. 
$1 to $2 is exactly the same as $1,000 to $2,000. A 100% increase.

Yes that is true, but it depends on where the reference point is. I have friends that are still convinced Bitcoin is a bubble and the true price is like $50. I have been telling them since it was $500 to start buying and they keep giving me excuses.

The simplest solution is to have all your purchases and sells of BTC go through one source, like Coinbase that can send you a final breakdown off all your transactions and sum up your gains or losses at the end of the year. However, this is where they take full control of all your transactions and track everything you do. Defeats all of what Bitcoin is, and treats Bitcoin as only an investment and removes all of Bitcoins most powerful features.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:27:17
First, hodling bitcoin is gambling. Sure we all feel it's not a gamble because we believe in it, and it has risen so much, but if it ever does come all the way down everyone will say, see it was such a gamble.
Two, there are good day traders as there are bad day traders. Good day traders understand the market much better. It's obviously not guaranteed all their trades will make them money, but they have the same luck as any hodler, just that they look for signals to give them the best odds to get in or out.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:34:16
I remember reading an article I think around 2012-13 about how homeless people could (if they had access to the internet) could watch ads and get paid in bitcoin. I think they made like 1-5 bitcoins a day, which got them around $5 or so. The reason I even researched bitcoin was because I thought I had a bitcoin mining virus on my computer, and thought what the hell is a bitcoin, then read how they were dirt cheap little currency coins (oh thats cute, little tokens to buy stuff online). If any of those bums held on, they are probably the new age Beverly Hillbillies!

Correction: Talk about bitcoin, especially to all your dumb friends that never listened to you, and tell them that if they only put in a few hundred dollars back then, they would have thousands. Make them feel real bad to the point that they start a club. First rule is - Talk about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:53:59
Actually at that point, it wouldn't be a value of what 1 bitcoin is, but more like what 1 microbitcoin is worth, which could easily be equivalent to today's dollar at $10.

@_date: 2017-11-09 16:13:27
Yea, I agree something shady was definitely planned. Still though, I am sure some lucky idiot decided to cash out.

Yea, I caught mine the first time I touched Coinbase. Now I keep growing more and they are getting bigger. The best part is, I have convinced many people it's ok to have some, I just talk them into it with some nice wine and a bitcoin movie. Then they get it too. Soon the whole world will be infected.
@_date: 2019-10-03 14:28:47
Nothing really. Everyone will just rush to buy Bitcoin Gold.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:08:48
But you have absolutely no idea how high bitcoin can go. It can become like the WORLD stock that everyone wants. Bitcoin may soon eventually turn into Milli-Bitcoin - that's 1000mBTC per BTC. So lets say bitcoin makes it to $10,000, that means 1mBtc is now worth $10. The average person will look at that and say, "oh only $10, I can buy 10 of those and just hold". Then lets say it jumps to $20 a mBTC. That guy is for sure gonna start ranting about how he just made $100 to all his friends, and so the cycle starts again!
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:08:32
Why do you think BTCs price pumped so much in the past few weeks, because everyone wanted a free coin. As soon as they cancelled the fork, there was a HUGE sell off. Who do you think was selling off?
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:57:06
No you don't have full control over your money. If a country wants to make a law and ban crypto currencies they easily can. So, say you decide to illegally purchase crypto, store it, and then the law finds out what you did with proof, they can prosecute you. I would think they could force you to give up your crypto or further punishment can be added. 
There are many things of *value* that are highly illegal that people trade. Just because crypto is functioning legally in most countries does not mean the person has complete control of it.

I got like 10 people on FB into BTC when it was around  and ETH was like $200. Both coins went pretty high and everyone was so happy, and calling me up like I was some wizard. Then, there was a big correction. They all freaked out and sold at the bottom. Then it went right back up. I ask them if they are getting back in, they said no, they don't want to touch this stuff. Sucks, because they would have made a ton more, but just can't get over emotions.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:31:20

@_date: 2017-11-08 07:31:50
But there are some of the richest people who day trade for a living and do it consistently. Day trading is not about flipping a coin and getting lucky, it's about having the best odds to make a trade. If they consistently are making trades that have a 51% chance of succeeding they will consistently make money.
Also, it's not about putting $1million dollars in and coming out with $1billion, it's about patience and knowing when to make that trade. Not all trades will win, but again, if a little more win than lose, over time you can make a good profit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:19:34

@_date: 2017-11-08 09:16:06
I get that. Everyone has their own way of investing, some are trying to collect as much BTC and could care less if the price goes to $50, they just keep buying. Some people want hard cash now to start buying things. So it's just what you want at the moment - and I would say majority want cash now. Also, my statement can be said as the opposite, Missed coins is better than lost coins, which would mean never sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:27:18

Money is a value of energy. Everything in the world needs energy, the more you have the more you can use. Who cares what the money is. As long as a society agrees what the exchange rate of that money is, it will function. 
Now when I say "money" I don't necessarily mean fiat controlled by a central bank. Bitcoin is a form of energy, and if you acquire it, you basically own energy. The more difficult the mining becomes the more energy it takes which is what the price is set as. As the value drops, and miners compete less, the difficulty becomes reduced, therefore the bitcoin is worth less energy at that moment. 
What I find so fascinating about Bitcoin is, we are technically putting a value on the physical laws of energy that is stored in a bitcoin + (for now) speculation. But what this means is, once bitcoin becomes less volatile, we can exchange a form of energy without it being controlled by a central institution - it will be free from control and be a natural form of exchanging energy.

@_date: 2017-11-09 02:15:04
It does exist it's just a speculative coin. I think some investor buys them from b2x developers. He then lists them on HitBTC at a certain price - higher than he bought. If they sell, he's out and made his profit or he might hold some. Now the coin is a futures coin that has no function cause it's not out but it has a price. Huge gamble, but a pretty nice gain if b2x came out and shot up. IMO still a dumb bet.

There are many different kinds of porn. Some will argue where the line is drawn when it becomes unnatural, and puts a false image of what is acceptable for how people should be treated. 
In my opinion, allowing a child to watch certain porn, like treating a woman like shit definitely is abuse as it teaches them that it's normal. Adults are old enough and experienced to separate fantasy from reality, children are sponges, they soak everything up and believe anything is real. I cant believe I actually have to explain myself to you. I hope you don't think this stuff is normal.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:28:08
I think so too. I doubt they will show anything about it's price and how you can become "rich". The show will not want to promote something that could potentially make millions of people lose money. Hopefully it breaks down the tech fundamentals more than the investment side.

But this is what I dont understand. Everyone says it *can* be a currency. But because of the high fees and slow speeds it seems very impractical. But it will be a currency in the future, but that is just speculation as it might never be. Can you tell me a crypto coin I can use now that is a practical currency. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:04:56
Exactly, the buy orders will never add up to the current price. Even right now looking on Coinbase if someone did a flash sell of 8900 bitcoins they would only get avg, $5300.
Now I wonder if someone were to dump 100,000 bitcoins that avg is gonna come way down.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:10:08
Yup. It's almost like you can't have a win - win situation. Even if I say, see I told you it would be worth a lot - they just feel worse, and I do too. What I did, is a bought a tiny bit for my close family, so when it does become worth a ton, I can say "see, you should have listened to me" *they get depressed and admit I am god* then I say "but good news, I actually bought you 0.01btc and its worth $10k! Now go clean up your dishes you left out in the yacht."

Well honestly I used bitcoin a ton back in 2016 to buy things. I loved it. It was so fast, cheap, easy to make a purchase online. 
Now I just don't understand what it is trying to be, because I can't use it anymore like a currency. I have a bitcoin and am just hodling it (like the rest of this sub). Since its too impractical to use it to buy things, I figured some people in the sub were right when they said it's turning into a store of value. But now because it competing with bcash, everyone is very adament to say that it is a currency, and now it has got me confused.

Yes, hodling is part luck too because who knows what will happen in this chaotic world. Unless you are a professional day trader then I think you can put aside luck and look for signals to always make you in the positive. 
But your comment was replying to someone who said people suck at day trading, and I think at least 90%+ do suck cause they think they know what they are doing. Your comment made it sound like, because of your results it's a better bet to day trade because you made up to 1btc.

How funny would it be if retail investors are doing the smart thing, and NOT buying the top, maybe they mostly stopped at $10k, and the rest were all bought up my manipulators trying to control the market, and its only them playing games right now.
I mean, do you REALLY know who the majority is buying and selling right now?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:59:52
Does any of this seem odd?
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:06:13
Exactly, you wait for them. The best strategy I think, if you want to make quick cash and not fantasize about a future one day in which you will have $1 million dollars is to stay in fiat and only buy on big, quick drops where you see a ton of red candles. Since you are already getting in lower than where the price was, lets say 7% lower, you have a very good chance of it at least going up - maybe not all the way up but enough to take a profit - don't get greedy. Now say you sell to only make a 1% profit, and then if it shoots all the way back up to the top, oh well, just wait for the next drop - don't beat yourself up and say I SHOULD HAVE HELD, because guess what you already won. If say you buy back in low and it drops even more - just become a hodler like everyone else because they are in the same boat as you now - but whatever you do, DONT gamble and sell lower cause this is where you have lost. Once you get back in and the coin goes back up to profits take it. Honestly, I think if you stick to this rule, you might not get the MAX profits but you get a good amount, and you are SAFE in case anything crazy happens, like horrible news. However, you have to watch the market constantly, and you have to always put a smile on your face when you make at least $1, because guess what, you are $1 richer and it's safe. Hodling is great and all but it's only great right now because bitcoin is on a constant uptrend, it still has the same risks as day trading. There is a reason why all those shit alt coins don't have tons of people saying, hodl, hodl, hodl, it's because when you hodl those coins you lose money all the way down. If bitcoin happens to crumble, all these hodlers are gonna be upset when they think hodling means bitcoin magically goes up.

No offense, but It always shocks me when people use history to argue something as being acceptable or not damaging just because it happened before and we survived from it.
There is a reason some societies are very civilized and advanced and that's because they evolved from getting away from those lifestyles. I'm sure in many third world countries parents bone right in front of their kids, thinking it's ok, and spit out baby after baby, then those children who were exposed start having sex at a very early age without any education to sex, and get diseases, or pregnant at 12 without any financial support to raise a child.
Although Sex is 100% natural and should not been shamed at, it can have a lot of consequences when natural instincts take over, and that's why it's a delicate subject with children as it can have a huge impact on how they develop and what they consider is normal. Just like kids who are sexually abused, they will most likely sexual abuse kids or partners when they grow up.

To you new investors, I know this is all risky (and still can be) but I mean, just think about how much bitcoin has gone through - the odds of it not ever going back up to $20k and beyond is...well, who knows, but just think about everything bitcoin has gone through and what is being developed today, that is all you need to focus on.

Stacking sats does not mean buying Bitcoin, it means I spent $10 and got 140,000 sats - which sounds way better than I got 0.0014 BTC, because 0.0014 is not a whole Bitcoin.
Buyers who get over 1 BTC do not say stacking sats cause they own 1 Bitcoin now, sats is irrelevant. I would never tell someone I stacked 100 million sats.
Do people say I make $40/hr at work or 4,000 pennies an hr? But if you were earning pennies you would say I'm stacking pennies, and when you have 100 you are now in the club to say you own 1 dollar.
I'm sorry but you will have to live with the new term. Keep stacking those sats till you're in the club!
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:59:15
Stack sats for younger folks who have limited money and cant afford much BTC. 
Buy Bitcoin for older folks who can afford full units of Bitcoin.
You're in the younger crowd, probably be better to say stack (buy) sats to your friends, as that will be more affordable for them.
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:21:40
You have to realize all those people are in profits. Majority want to cash out, so they eventually will. You wont catch the top but odds are very high that you will either be able to buy in where you sold again or buy in lower. This is of course coming off a major pump. 
Unless it's some major financial crisis and everyone needs bitcoin, will it continue to go up.

I wouldn't say we lie and tell them its evil. We say they aren't old enough to be exposed to that kind of stuff yet, just like drinking, and drugs. A lot of this stuff isnt naturally "bad" it just can be if abused. Kids haven't developed the experience and education to understand why they could be bad and how it can affect them long term as their brain is developing, so as an adult (parent) it's their job to monitor what they are exposed to and what can potentially hurt them long term.

No. It will eventually get to a point of minimal gains and much less volatility, as store of value. 
Once it reaches this point, other currencies that inflate will lose value to BTC, so for people looking for a decentralized savings account they will invest in bitcoin and hold. Sure some people may cash out for riskier investments that can make them more money, but btc wont collapse at the top like a ponzi, cause for ponzis to sustain  forever they need new money, bitcoin wont need "new" money but only other money losing value is what will make it an attractive investment.

So selling bitcoin is a gamble? But buying and holding isn't? 
It's a gamble either way. I'm not saying it's 100% certain you will come out ahead, what I'm saying is when majority of people value everything in fiat now, majority will want to cash out bitcoin on a major pump. Unless the world shifts into truly accepting bitcoin as a payment would it be risky to sell at the top.
My point is we are still on the edge of not knowing what bitcoin will turn into, so you have a better chance cashing out on a major pump than just thinking its going up forever. 
Whsts a huge risk is selling on the way down, now that is where you are giving up cheap BTC, but selling on the way up is much safer.

This is the best perspective to think about when reading stories like this. There is somebody at every significant milestone in Bitcoin that has sold and has the same story.

Have we ever experienced a technology like bitcoin? No. Are we seeing a pattern where it goes through the roof the comes crashing down, then does it again but higher? Yes. Does the halving reduce the supply by half? Yes.
If I really had to take a guess, I would bet on it going through the cycle again than it not. The signs are pretty much starring us right in the face that it will happen again.

I knew someone would call me out. I wrote that quickly, but in general terms it is reducing the supply of BTC entering the network by half.

Exactly! Bitcoin is a store of energy which holds value. So the more energy that is used to create it, the more value the bitcoins have. There are way more industrial plants that use more energy to produce valuable goods at a current time that lose value over time. Bitcoin will only gain value over time so that energy used is actually being stored and multiplied. 
So those first millions of bitcoins that were produced from a fraction of energy are now worth way more energy. That energy has been stored and can be transferred as it holds value. Someone is now selling that energy they payed for or harvested, for other goods or services. To me that sounds like a very efficient way of storing energy that can later be used.
Very hypothetical and totally unreal, think if the last bitcoin took the energy of the Sun to create, and it was worth an insane amount, all those bitcoins are now worth a Sun. Galactic empires will be trading the energy of the Sun in the form of bitcoin. "How much will it cost to build a whole city covering a planet? One bitcoin, the cost of energy from 1 Sun. Ok do it." All that material, labor, resources will now be used from that bitcoin - the sun just transferred all its energy to create a whole city covering a planet.
Ok so the last bitcoin is mined, no more commercial mining, can't extract energy to invest in bitcoin - well now the people who are buying bitcoin are storing their hard work of energy into bitcoin and it's only making the price go up because more people want it which increases the scarcity and the value rises because more energy is stored in bitcoin.
It's a storage of energy.

Yes it was fan-fiction. My point was bitcoin is a store of energy. The more energy put into it, the more it's worth because of its finite amount. 
I was responding to how burning energy on earth is not a waste for bitcoin, because that bitcoin now holds the value of that energy (basically just converting one form of energy to another.) If people start selling Bitcoin they transfer the energy used to create it. If too many people sell, it depletes the energy stored, if more people buy bitcoin it stores more energy.
Price is just an illusion - bitcoin's worth is actually how much energy is stored. My career pays me a certain salary based on how much my energy is worth. I can store that energy in bitcoin and later convert it for something else, unlike fiat my energy will lose value. But because bitcoin is finite and works very well in the digital world, it's bound to constantly increase in price.
About bitcoin reaching $1mil. There is nothing stopping it from reaching that price and going higher. $10,000 -&gt; $1mil is a 100x increase. When bitcoin was $100 a 100x increase took it to $10,000. 
The same guys who did not believe in it said the exact same shit: "It's delusional to think bitcoin could ever reach $10,000." Well they were wrong. I  would love to see it go 100x more but if it doesn't in 10-30 years, oh well, it's not the end of the world, but I think there is a high chance it can in that time frame.

If we just discovered some new rare element, and we started finding it in rare places around the earth, I can guarantee it would be just as volatile. People, research labs, companies would not know how to evaluate it yet.
Bitcoin is a new element introduced into our world, it's scarce, can be mined, already has a value, and functions exactly as intended.  
Give it many years from adoption and steadily decreasing mining rates and the volatility will slow down, just like gold did.

If you get enough people brainwashed to hodl, then less people sell, which helps keep bitcoin's value up. So if its BS or not, whatever helps my investment stay up in price means I should be promoting hodl as much as possible.

I agree it's not a bitcoin specific problem technically, it's a social problem on how people view bitcoin. What worries me is that bitcoin could be heavily pushed by institutions to turn bitcoin into an investment and to not hold your own keys. For bitcoin to truly succeed in its design, it needs to be adopted by people becoming their own bank. However if many people only see Bitcoin as a way to make money, they would go the easiest/safest route and just buy the ETF. This would drive these custody accounts to purchase more and more real bitcoin and not offer it for sale to the public. Then their is the theory of making bitcoin a fractional reserve, getting permission to offer more paper bitcoins. I think Mastercard applied for this patent.
There are many creative ways to hinder the tech behind bitcoin in an adoption way, even though nothing technically changes to the core value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:19:05
No, no. The price MUST go up very high first before the tech can be used. Lol

Everyone has a number a different prices to sell, plenty of early bitcoin adopters sell at higher prices which feeds 10 -100 more bitcoin hodlers. Then when that group hits their number they sell to the next 10-100 people. 
Guess who was in that last batch of 10-100 people, that first guy that sold. The cycle will just keep repeating. People will sell off when they see nice gains. Then re-enter later when they are shocked to see it has tripled.

No you're right, a lot can change, and it will. Personally I hate the idea of an ETF for bitcoin. Not for the value of BTC, I think it will ultimately go up, but for the use of the protocol it will start to slow down - and will not be encouraged to use as a currency. 
As for other coins - I know I will get shit on, but Tron is something that will start turning heads, and most likely be used as a currency. I am not going to sit here and shill all its features, but I encourage you to DYOR on it - and keep an open mind. Listening to the masses on reddit preach scam everyday on it is a fearful tactic. I've never once heard an argument based on its tech that imply scam or sketchy functionality. If you research it and find  the tech to honestly be shady, scammy, then good - you have an honest opinion, but from my perspective and research, the network is very robust and will be adopted. It actually gets used daily - it just surpassed over 1mil transactions for the day. In comparison ETH can only handle 1.3mil. 
If you use telegram, a great group to join is Sesameseed, the guys there are very smart, friendly, honest, and take time to answer every question. They are a super representative of Tron and I think will be a big factor for driving Tron.

What if you hate your job and you take your bosses pic and Photoshop it and make it look super bad and try to send it to a friend but accidentally send it to your boss? It's not that hard to imagine the risk of sending bitcoin or a bad email to the wrong address and then have to pay the price for such a mistake.
Even just wording an email wrong that was meant to go to certain people but the wrong person was added. My point being is always double check the address before sending.

Yup, and considering he has been buying and selling which is automatically taxed to make around his 1btc goal, he will owe about 0.2-0.25 btc depending on his tax bracket. Gonna have to keep trading to make up those losses given to taxes which will also be taxed.

Yes but if it pushes bitcoin lower there will be panic sellers that will sell coins to bigger players that will once again accumulate a bigger stash.

I understand what your saying, and in your examples fiat *was* king of money in our age, and now we are entering a new age of money - cryptocurrency. So far bitcoin is the most adopted cryptocurrency. It would be different if other technologies for money were being developed alongside bitcoin like some multi-dimensional cryptographic particles that could exchange money on the fly and keep a ledger, but I think it's pretty clear blockchain is the new technology that is going to dominate the new age of money, and bitcoin so far is the most adopted.
I don't think there will ever be one cryptocurrency that dominates the world, but I do believe bitcoin will be a huge part of the market and very valuable in the future. Think of it like the past with very rare gems and gold. Gold was the most traded currency, but rare gems were worth WAY more and could be traded for much more gold. Just in this case bitcoin may be a form of currency and store of value, and you just trade your bitcoin for other crypto or real life goods. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:31:45
Yes definitely higher risk. But owning both Bitcoin and alts is a good strategy if you want to catch an alt that will have a higher % gain to btc right now.
I think it's risky to *not* hold any bitcoin as btc should be a safe bet and always lead the way.

No. You're better off researching what BTC is, and what all the other coins are before you invest. There are other coins that are much safer, that pay dividends while you hold, so even if the coin goes down you break even.

When does bitcoin succeed? Is it when you cash out, or when majority of people don't think it will fail? I mean going from $0-$8k, peaking at $20k in about 10 years is pretty successful in my eyes.
If bitcoin hits $100k are we still going to have people calling it a bubble doomed to failure, how about $1mil a coin, or what about $10mil? I mean let's be real, $8k a coin is pretty damn impressive for some imaginary internet money that has steadily gone up over time. (Not some crazy 1 year hype that went back to $1).
So I guess no matter what the price is there will be people constantly worried it will go to zero, cause I guess it can? Or will it become so common, it has got the faith of a govt currency like USD and people will not even question it.

No word is inherently bad. But to communicate strong emotion, an insult, anger, there needs to be simple words for that; hence "fuck you". 
Just like using the middle finger is not bad, because it's just a finger, but we use it to communicate an insult to the other person without words. 
Some people may be immune to these words, but then what do they use when communicating a strong, powerful emotion or anger? Everyone has at least one word that triggers the biggest reaction out of them.

@_date: 2018-02-07 18:41:14
I don't get this. Holding does not automatically make the price high. The next person willing to pay a high price makes the price high. 
If bitcoin were to completely fail, and everyone holding it decided not to sell, how will the price be high if no one cares to buy it? The seller can set a price that is worth $1mil, but if noone wants to buy it, it won't be sold, and then the price gets lowered, all the way to a price that a buyer will pay.
Think of Bitconnect, at one moment someone was willing to pay $300, the next day someone was only willing to pay $20 - lots of people were holding and didn't have people wanting to buy at a high price. 
Now don't get me wrong, I am a full believer in Bitcoin and other crypto, but the demand to 'buy' is the main factor to determine it's high price.

I think this is the illusion with bitcoin that makes people think they can be tricky with multiple addresses. 
There are services that are being developed to automatically track address transactions connected to other addresses and label the address to whom controlled it. To the normal user, it seems like it's a complex web that is difficult and too time consuming to solve, but when you have every know variable such as amounts, addresses, timestamps with A.I. systems you can develop a tracking system that links user's bitcoins throughout the system. 
I'm gonna pass around tin foil hats for a second, but there might be a tiny bit of conspiracy behind bitcoin, and that it was created by a higher up organization (maybe govts), this way they can track each individuals wealth, and spending habits.

If there is no option to sell, then you lose. As long as *someone* is willing to offer money and you sell to them you lose because you now have no chance at ever making your money back (unless of course you buy back in cheaper or the same price again). But what you are allowing is a chance to **lose** an opportunity.
It's really not that hard to understand what that saying means. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:28:22
Exactly. In this video this woman is *trying* to explain it because all she know's is the technicalities of it, she is not explaining it's true basic function.
Like the internet in the 90s, there were no real mainstream applications for it yet (Google, Facebook, Amazon, eBay). Now that those are in place people understand the purpose of the internet, and can easily explain it. In the 90s, someone could only explain the technicalities of the internet cause not many people envisioned how the future internet would work and how to explain that.
For all we know, bitcoin may be used completely different than we think in the future and kids will easily be able to explain it's main function without any knowledge of the technicalities. So watching this video they are gonna be like, wtf are they talking about - they have no idea what bitcoins are really for.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:42:22
An ISP would be equivalent to say Coinbase. It's a service they provide. ISP gives you access to the internet, Coinbase gives you access to bitcoins.

Oh but you might think no one can physically steal your home. What about property taxes and other legal requirements that could end up making you lose your home. 
Bitcoin is very secure, but with great security comes great responsibility. If you are irresponsible, then let an exchange hold your private keys, and deal with those risks, but have the comfort of being able to reset your account.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:08:46
Exactly. I wouldn't be surprised in the coming year we start to see services you can pay for that do automatic tracking of coins through addresses. Since its all public and decentralized there is nothing illegal from a company developing some super sophisticated software for tracking ever coin moving from address to address on the blockchain and displaying a user friendly graphic that labels each address.

Yes but you don't kill it like people think you would, you slowly try to change the way people think about it or introduce something else that will steer people away or into another fad (icos, new crypto alts). 
The internet is nowhere near where it was 18 years ago. It's heavily dominated by big corporations, full of misinformation and mind controlling, advertising tricks, with social media, YouTube, other media. The internet is not as free as it used to be. Sure you can freely explore what u want, but getting there is heavily manipulated to make you think you are freely exploring the internet.
Bottom line, they will subconsciously destroy it by taking away what we truly want to use it for.

The problem is, how do employers filter out 100s of people that want to become interns without much to show on a resume? It's becoming more and more competitive and students need more to prove what they have accomplished. 
Degrees are hard work for a reason - and while I do agree a lot of the education doesn't apply directly to a future job in that discipline, it at least gives a student a well rounded education, because who knows where they will end up working and what skills they can apply. Most jobs aren't exactly discrete type of work, they take a lot of skills in different areas, and learning those skills comes from how you learn in school. I think education at a university level isn't primarily the knowledge you gain, but the whole challenge. Arriving to classes, taking tests, disciplining yourself to set time aside for studying, building relationships in class, solving unexpected problems, etc. Gaining knowledge is probably 50% of what going to school is about.

Well in those 4 years bitcoin did double about 5 times from $600 to $20000. 
So in 1460 days it doubled 5 times which is an average of 292 days to double.

As soon as BTC moons again, many people who made huge gains will have extra buying power. What do they do?
 "Hmm I just made $10k profits in BTC. If i take $500 out and throw it in X alt, which is down 70%, I have a chance of it pumping and making a better return! Is it risky? Yea. But it's only $500 out of my $10k. I'm basically playing with free money!" 
Now imagine many people who might have this mindset, just like in December-January when they cashed out BTC and many alts mooned. 
I'm sure many alts will pump again when people start making big profits off BTC.

Dude when bitcoin hit $10k that was already a huge migration of wealth. Why is $1mil any different? It's all just % change. I'm fact if it does hit $1mil there will more coins spread out, meaning very few will own 1 bitcoin compared to today.
And your also assuming everyone hodls to $1mil. I can guarantee many people who have at least 1 bitcoin now will not hodl all the way up.

I wasn't arguing that they should or shouldnt bleep out the words, im saying it's what I think TV stations do so people who aren't watching are not subjective to words that they might find offensive. In my example, say mom and dad want to watch some prime time tv and it has violence, half nudity, animals being killed whatever you want visually bad, but the audio playing will be passed through to the other rooms. The kids will see nothing on the show but will hear all the inappropriate words that mom and dad are trying to shield from their kids. This is why I think TV networks bleep the words out because audio can't be blocked.

But it is not more secure to have it on an exchange. An exchange can get hacked, seized by authorities (BTC-e), shut down to where you can potentially lose your coins. Holding your own bitcoin in your personal wallet *is* the most secure, but also takes the most responsibility. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:55:56
Because you cannot escape audio, but you can look away. What I mean by this is say you put children in another room while they play with their toys. They won't see the violence but they will hear the words, and words are something they can easily recite.

I actually tried doing this when it was going up - It didn't work, I kept buying high and it kept going up so I never sold low. So I switched it to buy low sell high and at the top I sold and the coin kept going down and I bought the bottom. I suck at this game, I just keep making more coins. I thought the goal was to donate bitcoins. 
Honestly though, if you actually try to lose its just as hard.

Each new high, say $100k will convince hodlers and new buyers that it has a better chance to $1million, but then you will have all the non believers still throw out words - bubble, tulip, dot com, ponzi... I mean at what price will people actually see the truth behind bitcoin, but I guess any price people will continue to say it will go to zero, even if it breaks $1million.

I guess I technically did because I didn't sell at 19k. Remember that guys, every price you don't sell at, you are buying at that price. 
And vice versa, every price you don't buy at you are selling at that price. So if you had extra cash laying around when BTC was $6,000 you are a seller at $6k too.
Edit: I guess most people clearly don't see how this works. Every moment you make a decision not to sell, you are allowing it to stay in at that price, effectively buying at that price. I had $19k in my hands and at that exact price rebought at $19k and held all the way down. So I did buy at $19k.

Yea but thats recovered to it's ATH. It still gained like 300% in between that time. Lots of opportunities to make good returns.
Just because the coin tanks from it's ATH, and you are holding, doesn't mean you can't buy a little more super low and sell that off when it has a little pump. I've been doing this all the way down to the 5ks, already made a nice profit which brings my overall avg down.

What if BTC is steadily climbing, and there is always a "real" price, but people get out of control and fomo, panick, and play the market and all these other investment reactions. 
As of now it feels like BTC is truly worth ~$6k cause thats where its been at its lowest all year. But that $6k is incredibly higher than 2016s price. who cares about where it peaked, that's irrelevant. So what if in 2020, it does crash to $75k, then maybe that's it true price, and all the fomo brought it up to $250k, and all the $20k who bought were sitting OK, but the panic sellers who gave up are the ones who truly lost out.
End of the day, BTC doesn't give two shits about who you are, and if you need it or not, so it will do everything it wants, pump, dump, make you emotionally crazy, etc... but if the price continues to rise than all this volatility is just meant to distract people and most likely make them lose money. 
This is why HODL is so powerful. If you truly want to make enormous gains, then just leave the damn thing alone and check back in 5 years.

What's funny is, if the bubble would have stopped on it's way up from $1k, at $5k,$10k,15k,$20k, that guy would be told, it's your fault for buying that high. Well, if it wasn't for those risk takers we would have never made it to $20k. So I salute the last guy that bought at the very top, he was only trying to take us to $25k and beyond. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:31:26

Never said it's ok. I mean bitcoin is unregulated, in an open, free market. Anything can happen, there is no guaranteed TA way to predict where bitcoin is going. Its been getting manipulated since the beginning. But still it continues to go up in value because its limited and everyday more people find out about it and pull from the supply.
My point was, if you are a believer long term, just hodl through all this noise. If there is clear manipulation in markets that are regulated, then sure let there be investigations and authorities to deal with the bad actors, but overall, bitcoin will continue to function, and trade outside those markets and do what the world decides to do with it, which will ultimately continue to drive the price up, or not and manipulation will just be a side effect. 
@_date: 2019-09-11 03:41:53
Correct. But, I always thought of Satoshi as colorless - never once questioned a race. The whole point to Bitcoin is to be decentralized - we are all included, we are satoshi, no matter who we are, no matter our race.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:42:49
Everyone's stupid prediction is just where they "want" to see it - so they speak their mind to get others to follow. If people read over and over its going to $2000 why would they buy, they should sell. And the opposite, it going to $50k they should hold and buy more. I've never seen a prediction go against what someone is hoping for. 
Everyone predicting it going lower wants to buy cheap, because THEN it will go to $100k, but no, no, it cant go to $100k now cause they can't afford it at this price and make huge gains.
The reality is, ~$6k is the lowest its going for the year. We have tested that price many times and the market has decided it's the bottom. People are just hoping to buy dirt cheap btc cause they missed that price.

So, if we have a massive bull run from coinbase's custodial service, and it triggers more awareness again and average people start buying into bitcoin, how is this not adoption? The logic is, how is something that is giving more exposure, investment opportunities, hype, price increase, competition, a reason to drive adoption away? I could be wrong, maybe I'm missing something, but to me this sounds like a step in the right direction for bitcoin to get stronger legs. 
If what your saying is because Coinbase will be hoarding bitcoin, and only offering the investment side like a title of ownership and no keys, then I get the idea, but there is still plenty of bitcoin around for sale for regular people to purchase and use as a currency, as it can be divided up. Bitcoin is used however people want to use it.

Lets see: 
Car salesman,
Gamblers at a craps table,
Uber drivers,
Bar tenders,
Convenience store clerks.
The list goes on. While I'm sure some of these people couldn't give two shits about what I had to say at the time, it always made me wonder if they saw the price in Dec and thought I was some God given blessing, to alert them about a huge financial opportunity. Or 95% of them didn't buy at that time, but took the chance at $19k, and are now trying to find me to say I ruined their life.
It's always fun though, to hear random people's opinions about bitcoin, and to see their perspective. Most are clueless though or think it's a huge fad.

Yea, it's basically just paying for advertising and control. 
Make comments to sell your product, like, say, a new ICO coin and start making "intelligent" posts shilling it all over and pay for the upvotes to advertise it. Anyone who makes a comment pointing out the flaws, just pay and downvote them so they are never heard. In the end you might spend thousands, but if you get enough idiots to buy into your scam coin you'll receive millions.

Back in the day when BTC was like $1s there were real physical Bitcoins that had a private key embedded on them. I think they sold for just a little more cause of the physical property, but I think today if you own one, and they are still in it's original wallet, they are worth more because they are a freshly minted BTC with no transaction history.

Marketcap is such a useless metric because it does not use real data its just a price for the last trade. There have been some estimates that real money moves the marketcap by 25-50x but that could all be BS too.
$6k is no more or less risky than in 2013/14 when the price hit $1200 - no one knew the future. In fact most people had given up on it cause of the massive bubble it experienced and the long bear market. Think about all those people who panic sold at $500 and happened to buy back in 10x higher. I am not saying its guaranteed bitcoin will reach insane heights, but we have seen a steady climb so far since its birth - how many more signals do we need that BTC is steadily climbing? The problem is, people get caught up in the volatility and try to evaluate if btc is going to survive or not when the volatility is just the byproduct of such low distribution of coins.  
I think people will always think BTC is doomed to go to zero, despite it going up constantly. I know we haven't broke the ATH yet (which I think it will), and if we do, there will have never been a "price" that was too risky to buy - but even after that, $25k -$30k-$50k, there will be another wave of people who feel it is now WAY too risky.

If they offered these coins in the 1970s each coin would have a fiat value of ~$0.65. Let's say you held onto these coins till today and happened to hold 1000 of them, so about ~$650 worth. Today a big mac costs ~$4.  
So, you would be holding around $4,000 worth of big mac coins.
So start hoarding big mac coins, they could be worth $40 a coin in 30 years.

The goal is to use bitcoin as the actual method of payment. You could pay with bitcoin and at that same moment convert the USD you wanted to spend to bitcoin. This would be a way to spend USD but without actually purchasing the products, just purchasing bitcoin. 
But there are lots of drawbacks to this. Always having to buy bitcoin would be an extra step to do, having to deal with exchange fees, market volatility (seconds can make a price change drastically) and you still need to be approved to buy bitcoin on most exchanges with USD, and it's only going to become more restricted.

I am a hodler. I like to think my mind is at peace. I don't stress about selling or check the price constantly. I just buy a little more if I see it come down, adding to my stack. If it goes to zero, oh well, at least I was calm as I held and never went through panic selling or fomo attacks. No one truly knows what will happen, so that's why I made a choice to hold for many years. One thing for certain is the future will be radically different, so might as well be a part of it.

Yup, good point. And this time though, we have a way better infrastructure for crypto. Back in 2014 there were only a handful of exchanges, and no big players involved - like CBOE, CME, Wallstreet,  we had nothing close to an ETF. This time there is actually a solid foundation to crypto, so there is less likely a chance for it to fail.

Bitcoin going to $3k is not going to happen. There are way too many people who could afford that and want in. The year has already bottomed out at around $6k. There is no reason to push it further down unless some serious FUD comes out, like Coinbase getting hacked. Even if the ETFs get rejected, bitcoin will just take longer to get in a strong bull market, but that wont be a reason to make the market drop another 60%.

It depends on the cost of your electricity, as that will lower your profits. I have a 1070 and found it useless to mine because it keeps your PC running full load constantly, producing a lot of heat, raises the cost of my electric bill and also makes it so I cant even use the PC normally. At the current rate I think I would make $40/month in profit after the cost of electricity, but that's running it 24/7. So if you run it at night for 8-12hours, you will make half that. Being a 1080ti, you might make an extra $5-10/month.

The people holding thousands now will most likely have sold on the way up, and then own 100s. 
People who own a couple bitcoins now will most likely sell some when they see huge gains, like 30-50x. So imagine someone who has 1000s to spare, what's 50 here and there.
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:23:53
If this is true then it still only applies if you made a profit. So then, if you buy btc at $10k move it at $9k and pay $5 fee, you technically can claim a loss because you sold btc at a lower rate.

I was just throwing a reference point as an example. But for fun, sure, it wasn't worth a ( lets use USD for now) $ amount agreed on by everyone at the beginning, but as soon as it was invented some form of energy was used to create it. Satoshi had to give up time, which had a value to him to create the coin. So hypothetically, let's say his worth (in time) was like $50/hr. Each hour used to create bitcoin was already worth $50 each hour. Bitcoin began with an invested amount of X$'s from 1 person. You could say, at the time Satoshi knew the price of Bitcoin to be worth a lot more than $50/hr and was ok with giving it away for *free* or selling it for a very, very small price maybe not in $'s but something else. So now it's time to bring it onto the world and get other investors. Who wants bitcoin? To get some bitcoin you have to give up something, be that time to listen and read about his invention, give up a tiny fraction of electricity to mine it, or trade a pizza. Then, the easiest way to acquire bitcoin became exchanging money.
That original invested worth that bitcoin started out with right after Satoshi created was soon to be seen as undervalued by people as time went on, then as more time passed people saw more value as it was limited, which increased the price so much that it's now worth billions, unlike the X$'s that was invested from the start.
So going from the thought of bitcoin, to paper, to actual code, to real world use always had some value. Now does that mean every thought a human has in their head has a value because the thinker gave up time/energy to think about it, which has a very, very small value to them? 
And as interesting as that all is, this comment is actually worth something, I just give up time writing it up, when I could have been out spending my time making money by how much I think I'm worth. But the hard part now is trying to sell it to a publisher to get my time invested back ;)

shitcoin is just in reference to bitcoin. I have been in crypto since 2013, bought my first BTC at $600, and have been through all the ups and downs. I have now primarily invested in Tron ( not really TRX) but tiny startups on Tron (Sesameseed) that I believe from my research will return incredible gains. Yes I know this is what most people think of their small alts, but again, these decisions are from plenty of research I have done, and feel confident.
To me, Tron is nowhere near a shitcoin since I use it everyday and it actually has a purpose for me. The decentralized nature, the Dex, the wallet, dapps, speeds, fees, all attract me to the network. Yes I could just sit in BTC and watch my money grow but I actually like to use crypto, and I think Tron will easily attract more users due to use case not just to make money. The small projects I am invested in will return the returns I am looking for, which will pay bigger dividends later, letting me keep my investment, and sell off the dividends for profit.

You are taxed whenever you sell the coin. Selling implies: convert to cash, convert to a different coin, a product, a service, even a withdrawal out of an exchange to a different wallet is considered a sell.
Basically anytime it leaves a wallet or is converted to a different thing it's considered a sell.
But only if you make a gain from your initial purchase are you required to pay taxes on that sell.

So in your example, yes, that is scary if they control fiat, but isn't that what bitcoin is for, to use a currency free from control - to use a decentralized form of money, we should all be hodling, don't go back to fiat.

People who took short positions (bet btc would go down) lost their position because btc shot up so fast. When btc hits a certain price it forces them to buy back the coin at a higher price (losing money), further making btc go up. Do this to enough people who are shorting and the price shoots up very quickly because they are all forced to buy. 
Bottom line, lots of people who shorted btc got rekt!
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:34:32
Coinbase reported everyone's info to the IRS that did over $20k in volume (not profit). Could just be 1 btc buy at $20k or even 2 buys and 2 sells of btc at $5k or you got reported if you did 200+ trades (could be $1 each).
Lots of people are now forced to report their gains or losses to the IRS or the IRS is gonna come after them. So I would expect the IRS is going to collect a lot of tax money this year.

Yea, but my point being is, is confidence created by more investors when the price keeps climbing because it's starting to build a solid foundation of trust? The more it goes up the more users, the more adoption etc. Sure we "dropped" from $20k but it's still significantly high in it's time period of growth. Also, people were joking in this sub when it was around $2k, laughing that if it were to hit $20k and crash to under $10k people would be super bummed, while at that time people said if it crashed to $10k I wouldn't care cause I would be rich as fuck. Well, here we are.
I think the risk of bitcoin failing at $1 was 1000's of times higher than at $100,000. Heck, I just think everytime it goes up the less likely it will fail, I think its reducing risk, for the long term.

If I want to get paid cash electronically. I have to go through a third party, (bank or some other money processing service). Bitcoin will eliminate this. In seconds I could have my funds 100% secured into my personal wallet and in seconds spend it. 
Why would someone *want* to get paid in BTC? Well if the value is slightly going up, say 2% year, sure I'll take it. If it gives me 100% control sure I'll take it. If it's as easy as, click I made a wallet, now please deposit my money, sure I'll take it - no need to setup a bank account. I can spend it in seconds, convert to other crypto, pay bills more efficiently, just wave my phone over a vending machine with a QR code and buy snacks. Bitcoin will make transacting much easier and efficient. We are living in a digital world, money is inevitably going digital - and decentralized money spent across boarders will be in more demand. 
As of now lots of ideas are being put forth to design systems that make everything simple, safe, efficient. It's not going to happen overnight, and that's why right now its best to invest cause its dirt cheap. If bitcoin hits a very high price, volatility will greatly reduce. If it were to break $1mil a coin I doubt we would see 10% swings a day, more like 0.1% a day, but at that high of a value it would more likely slowly rise than ever drop massively.
I thought a bank needs people to deposit money? Who's money do they loan out if they have no money?

Not really, alt's ratio have been **much** higher than they are now. If we continue this bull run alts will outpace bitcoin. Though it's not bad to move into bitcoin if you're making a profit, but if you're still under on an alt, just wait it out, they will go higher.

If you start to feel uneasy, thinking people know you hold bitcoin, just tell them you sold a while back at its last big crash.
If you told them the day before, when it's like $100k a coin (and you say you have a couple), you don't have to worry, they will just think you are a liar, and will ask you to prove it.
If you prove it, then yea.... you're just an idiot.

Even if someone has money they can *afford* to lose, it still sucks thinking your fantasy to become rich is disappearing along with saved up free spending money. 
But I could never imagine the feeling of losing money for rent or bills that would destroy my credit - that just seems risky as hell.
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:40:34
Exactly. Would people be happy to provide all their information to an ATM, that is is required, like Coinbase, for a 1.5% fee. If not then too bad, you're not going to get a fee lower than that right now, and most likely won't see a fee lower than an additional 3-5% markup to cover all the overhead costs.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:21:06
Ahh smart man. So you can buy many more cheap.
Here's a test. Would you sell 5 right now for each at $40k **IF** you are NEVER allowed to buy BTC (or any top ten alt coin) ever again?

"Highly likely" of course its not for sure, but based off research, data, past trends, world economies, an educated guess can be created.
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:41:52
Yea, I'm curious what exchange rate they use. Buying a car at $250k will make a pretty big difference on the exchange rate. 
The point of using btc to pay for something is to avoid exchange fees, and avoid withdrawal times to get the fiat back into the bank.
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:37:22
My point is you never know why someone is rooting for a number. The guy who wants to wake up at $74k might only have less than 1btc at $20k or cheaper and would go crazy over $74k. And the guy who wants it to only go to $7400 might make $1k-50k profit, you never know.
A 12% gain is HUGE if you have a lot of cash to invest with. For ex. I have been throwing some big stacks of cash when it gets low, then cash out at around 10% gain. I have been pocketing $1k here and there. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:02:07
If you put $100,00k in at $6600 and it hits $7400 that's 12% gain. So $12k in a week. Not bad I would say. If you have the money, no need to wait till $74k ��
But yea, big risk, big reward, it could easily drop to $5400.
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:42:21
It's not about buying a *coin* it's just about how much cash you put in. You can easily put $10,000 in at 1k per btc, then see it go to $600, same % loss.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:42:32
Don't stress over being in one or the other - diversify.
I love bitcoin, but I also find some other alts that I feel confident towards, so I invest a little in those too. 
Just pick 3 or more coins, majority btc, and let them sit.

Super BTC
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:07:22
Nope, its not difficult. On Coinbase they track each buy/sell to other coins ex. Btc/eth based on their dollar value and still report a profit to the IRS if you have a profit. 
So say you trade btc/eth all day and make 1 additional btc. At that time whatever btc is worth in $ is your gain at that time. If you never sell it for cash and btc drops to $1 you are still stuck paying that gain, unless you were to convert it to eth, which would show a loss and you could even out your gain. 
Also, they are working on tracking user addresses and will be able to identify if you buy btc low, and buy a product when btc is high. You still have to pay bitcoin gain taxes on that purchase, plus sales tax, plus income tax if you bought the coin from cash that you made from working, etc..  
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:33:53

It possibly could. But usually when a FAD peaks and dies out it doesn't come back stronger. 
It would be like POGs in the 90s coming back in the 2000s and even more people into it.

Yea, fair enough. But we must all not forget bitcoin is world wide. Just because it's rare in our area does not mean merchants are not adding it. 
I am sure in Japan it would be somewhat common to see a shop that accepts bitcoin. 
However, one thing that is growing quite fast are BTC atms. I have seen quite a few (though that is a different use of BTC, not a shop accepting it, but still a form of using btc that brings awareness).
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:59:27
The way I look at it is, you don't *make* money with bitcoin you are saving yourself from losing bitcoins in the future when they cost 20x more. The goal is to acquire as much as possible before they go super mainstream.

Block reward gets cut in half in about every 4 years, its called the "halving".
Right now when a block is found, 12.5btc get released, its estimated in 2020 the next halving will happen and only 6.25btc get released, so imagine on 2040, only 0.1953125 btc will be released per block.... gonna take a long time to mine the rest of all the coins to 21 million when every 4 years less and less coins are released. 
Each halving should have an effect on price as well, making the price go up because there are less new coins from miners to sell to the market, that is if everyone is hodling.

@_date: 2018-04-11 22:05:32
Exactly. We are still at the very early stage. And yes, it may be delusional to think BTC could be worth $100k-$1mil a coin, but if BTC does become highly adopted and used as a currency, it will easily reach that price if not higher and should be a lot less volatile. Volatility is super high right now cause the market is tiny. BTC is just not ready yet to fully convert into a world currency, so it's best to acquire as much as possible. Over time, more growth, steady price increase, less volatility, it will all compound and eventually reach the pinnacle, when spending and holding don't matter anymore. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:53:30
Yes but the higher it gets fomo'd into and then drop massively after a correction, the more likely people will think its going to zero. 
When it hits $1mil and drops to $500k, I don't care what people say, but they will believe 100% that bitcoin is done forever, lol 
This is the logic new people have.

Never said it can guarantee a perfect version of the word, but it can generate words out of thin air that may sound legit to a listener without having the time to examine every word. I think it's pretty impressive, especially since it's on the path to very soon becoming software that may 100% replicate anyone's voice - and that creates a lot concern. To counter this, they are implementing some type of watermark, so any audio can be examined to be audioshopped.
This reminds me of the episode from Black Mirror, S02E01. In the future, a woman's husband dies, and she uses a service that takes all of his online information that he posted when he was alive, like his voice. Then it recreates his voice exactly and can communicate with her as A.I. Now imagine that, having a conversation with a loved one over the phone, thinking they still exist. o_0

Right. So many friends I talk to keep saying oh it's way too high...I missed the opportunity, but they fail to understand that in 5-10 years bitcoin could be worth $100,000 a coin. Then those people will be upset wanting to be us at this time. :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:12:08
The thing people don't get is that even if you bought say 1000 coins at $1 - many amateur investors would sell the second they made 2x-3x their money. Cause at that time bitcoin was very new, many beginners could never imagine it going 2200x their money. 
At every moment of time, no one truly knows what the value will be. The only guarantee is if you hold, then you have a chance but people are greedy, and can't live with theirself if they miss an opportunity to sell and come out on top.
Basically, you can't win either way. You can miss the opportunity at the bottom and miss the opportunity at the top. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:25:09
In the past couple months, I thought it would crash to 900, then 1300 then 1500 then 1800. You can't ever guarantee a crash or rise... but you can guarantee holding and buying.

The sad part about this is, the price is actually on the way down from $200k. It crashed all the way to $50k then did a little pump to $73k. 
Sad to say, but at this moment there are millions, laughing/crying/calling it a tulip/final bubble, all saying it will go to zero and get out now!!

He would have sold them the second he made $100. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:54:33
Yea. Still it's a lot of luck though. It could have gone to $100. But it's sorta natural, when something moves in a direction too fast there is a very high chance it will reverse. Those are the moments to gain.

And the possibility of people making lots of money was higher than too. Many people think it will jump to 10k in a few years, now. Would love to see it, but seems like a very tough climb. We will need a major crash first for it to get there.

I came here to reddit to shout about how bitcoin hit $2200. It shot up faster than I could get ready for work, drive there, have my morning meeting. Now I'm at lunch and it has almost gone up $100. My gosh, at this rate I can retire early :) :) :) 
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:44:33
Man, I played with BTC up in the 1000s in 2013/14. I lost a little, and remember completely forgetting about it. I checked one time in 2015 and sorta chuckled - hmm that was an interesting bubble.
However, it always fascinated me how you could gamble with bitcoins. Poker sites (seals with clubs) and other casinos. So, I started buying a ton of bitcoin to gamble with. Ended up having a bunch in my accounts and well...HELLO it starts taking off!
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:20:48

One way to make you feel better is even if you bought at $10 you most likely would have sold when you made a big amount... then bought in later then see it crash then sell, etc...It's a natural thing. It's not easy to buy, ignore the price and then be a millionaire. All those moments $10k, $50k, $200k would make you think real hard - what if it crashes and I lose all this!
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:03:02
Sell all of it at current price on GDAX - have a USD balance of $250,000. Then be limited by the withdrawal limit for moving USD to a bank account.
Also, GDAX is owned by Coinbase - they both have same limits and seamlessly transfer between each other.
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:48:51
Um, isn't that what is happening now from the people that bought at $50? People now were willing to pay almost $3000 for one fucking coin!
So when it becomes even more demanding, people may want one at $10,000 a coin!

Here's a tip if you don't want to freak out and do the hodl game: Always go against the grain. When it shoots up fast just sell. Then wait for a nice crash and buy. When I saw ETH hit $140 I HAD to buy more - cause it was dirt cheap. Now it's high I just sell it all. Rinse and repeat.

@_date: 2017-07-28 04:49:18
Yea, gotta agree here. I want people to invest but I also want them to at least understand the basics. If you dont understand the basics then you take a much higher risk. Once more security, simplicity is solved then will bitcoin become mainstream, and should be adopted by the majority who don't 'need' to understand it. That is why being an early investor has risks but big rewards. If you don't understand the basics of how bitcoin works then you give yourself more risk. The people that understand the most will likely come out on top as they have done their research and get the benefits of securing reducing their risk. So yea, people need to do more research before they throw money at something they don't understand.

Can't wait when the time comes and another guy says the same thing. "If it hits $3k I'll take a loan out".

The thing with these crypto investments is finding the solid projects that pay dividends. I am invested in about 8 different projects that will constantly pay dividends. They are very small marketcap coins so I own a large %, that if they do succeed, and we enter a bullmarket, I can just live off the dividends and not have to worry about selling.
So far my investments are paying me about $20 worth of crypto a day. Been this way for 6 months now, the goal is to get to $200 a day.
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:02:05
Exactly. And on top of that, as he buys the value keeps going up. It's not like bitcoin at the current price is fixed. After he bought say half million the price could easily go 4x.

So again what if it does go to 1000, are you going to be mad or something? Or will you just continue to say it will never reach 1500...

I agree that Ethereum will crash pretty hard eventually, but we are not even close to that time. It's all speculative, yes, but this is the beginning of the rise; point being you should have converted later on if you wanted to buy even more BTC. If you are not that much in it for monetary gain, and just want to support your ideology about BTC that is fine, but to pull out of Ethereum now if you do want to make money is a bad choice - should ride this wave to the top.

Totally agree with you, it does depend on the situation.
