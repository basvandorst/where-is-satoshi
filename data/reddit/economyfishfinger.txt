Too communist 
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:57:32
Yeah... sure. Piss off

Sounds pretty scammy to me. Preloaded crypto wallets.... Yeah right.  He's basically taking advantage of newbies

Im curious and a Google search could probably find the answer but it's interesting how it actually got to a position to convince folk to put money into it

I bought some at 60 and used it to buy hash. Worth it. ��

Pretty much. People desperate for the dip.
Dip happens. 
People lose their shit.
Classic Crypto comedy ��

Then again that's money not being put back into the UK economy. Which is not a good thing

Revolut works a charm and no sepa fees . Used this quite alot.

When the trial runs out just use another email address :-)
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:13:47
Just be aware you can't do anything with the crypto. Mine is unlocked but all you can do is store it on Revoluts internal ledger.  
No access to private keys or even a wallet address.  Great if your end game is just to hold it. Thats fine and the exchange rate is decent.
I'd help you out but as stated I've already unlocked it. If anyone does help they can easily delete the app and never use it again all he needs are three people to sign up using his link

Nab yourself a free trial of trading view. That works very well. Can also link some exchanges your on via api

Bitcoin is taxable.  Gambling is not
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:25:00
Yeah never liked the idea of the iou.  What if it's not really a Bitcoin or eth you are even getting? Pretty sure that's been answered by revolut admins tho and it is a bitcoin. Just you're not entitled to it's wallet :-p shame too as I was pretty excited about the prospect.  
However you have untill tomorrow to claim a free revolut physical card. Got mine yesterday. Just delete the free virtual debit card and claim the physical one. Then speak to customer services to get the virtual one reactivated

It's an encrypted picture stored in an encrypted archive stored on an encrypted email server...

I was gonna say Revoluts....
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:29:31
Op  hasn't been in crypto long? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:52:26
I got mine from wish.com free with 50p shipping.
