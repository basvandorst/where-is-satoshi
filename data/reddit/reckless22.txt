I agree fees should be low and made for scale of everyday use transactions. For scale, to wire this kind of money it'd be hundreds of dollars potentially. $1 is pretty reasonable for this quantity.

Why are people down voting this comment? The guy just asked a question. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:53:17
What evidence do you have that I am an insider trader? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:02:24
Cheap but not free. In the past year however, fees have gotten out of hand because of a scaling debate. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:19:38
There is nothing wrong with insider trading.

Believing that something should not be illegal or morally condemned doesn't prove I do that thing. Either you're a troll or an idiot.

Bitcoin Core. But once it's proven other cryptocurrencies will adopt their systems. Raiden for Ether, Bitcoin Cash will, Dash, PIVX, ect. Will all add it soon afterwards.

You're saying I'm a criminal. For what, disagreeing to your statism? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:52:42
That is not an argument for why it should be illegal. It's just state worship. Plenty of things are illegal and shouldn't be. Some things are legal and should be. Morality and legality are different things.

Nothing keeps Bitcoin Cash from also implementing a lightening network. There is just less incentive to do so because of its lower fees and faster transaction times. It still has to implement segwit as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:29:33
Sounds like the Bitcoin never leaves Coinbase or am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:51:41
Source? Honest question.

This doesn't seem right to me at all. I see faster, more abundant RAM every year. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:36:41


You should know that this is pretty much Roger's argument for Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:35:17
I think you have a good grasp on it. The expression of the purpose is where the debate is as well, big blocks vs off chain. I personally prefer the big block solution but also I have concerns about it. Do you think Bitcoin should be a replacement for cash (Bitcoin Cash) or should it be a replacement for reserve assets for financial institutions (Bitcoin segwit). 
On Roger, I would listen to a few interviews with professional media (Dave Rubin for example). On those he seems like a nice enough dude, but I tend to get along well with smart type A people. The guy does seem to get a lot of personal attacks on Twitter and reddit. I'm not sure why except that some people have a lot of money at stake and they don't like somebody pointing out the problems with Bitcoin. 
Roger has apologized for the unprofessionalism of the interview OP posted he deserves a listen to, even if you disagree. I know I wouldn't want people to think my mistakes define me in my totality.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:31:13
You are not mistaken on those terms. That's the problem the community is split on what Bitcoin is suppose to be. A currency or an investment. What do you want it to be? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:05:28
I belive the question is why not both? Why not increase the blocks now to relieve the pressure and move to segwit /LN when they are ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:41:31
It's important to realize it's a technology. Blockchain tech is well proven on several levels. Not all. We have a scaling problem! But that is true for all investments or entrepreneurial endeavors. We wouldn't have a scaling problem if there wasn't a tremendous amount of demand for stores of value outside the US dollar. 
Imagine if you could be an angel investor in IBM when they first got started. Or windows, or Apple. Not only that you could it in a permissionless system of anonomimity. That's what Blockchain tech and Bitcoin are.

He's obviously mad at refusing to use the name of the thing he's there to talk about on his terms. He's also mad at being accused of paying for the support of his ideas, which I would also find offensive and frustrating. Wouldn't you? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:26:25
AKA banks?

What source are you relying on to say exchanges only move small amounts of transactions and thus pay fees?

1. Hello Sir. What is your name? 
2. My name is Frank.
1. Ok Steve, good to meet you
2. Ha, my name is Frank.
1. Nice, Steve what can I do for you?
2. Seriously, the name is Frank.
1. Why are you getting upset Steve?
2. Because that's not my name, my name is Frank.
1. But Steve, other people have that name.
2. And that's what I prefer to be called.
1. Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve
2. You are being incredibly rude.
1. Steve, Steve, Steve, Steven. I bet you buy all your friends who call you frank because you are Steve. 
2. Fuck you man.
Who is being rude here 1 or 2?

So no one does. Then I expect you to call out anyone who calls Roger "the bcash ceo". You can't have it both ways. 


"Actual people would disagree, you're selling pizza and the interviewer wouldn't call it what you preferred he'd be the jerk but you're a hack for Bitcoin Core so you won't. "
Isn't that rude?

Thus sort of attitude doesn't help help anyone. And won't improve Bitcoin. I'm saying this and I am also skeptical of LN.

Lightening Network. There are some good explanatory videos out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:38:24
This kind of defensiveness is what has lead to the toxic atmosphere. Some of us are actually concerned and want to discus why Bitcoin is at an either-or juncture rather than a both-and. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:08:38










If I said, check out Bob's pizza and you said, "I like to call it tomato pancakes" and you're there to interview me, are you seriously arguing that I'm out of line? Its obvious would didn't catch the point. Whatever the debate on the name, there's no defense for saying Roger pays for his support online. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:40:49
I am pretty sure Roger has said in interviews that they have 8 or 9 developers at Bitcoin Unlimited.

I don't understand why your getting down voted. It's just an opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:36:03
I thought you'd be unwilling to actually back it up. Pretty sure this subreddit is full of enough people willing to say anything about the guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:51:08
Wait someone stole from him and what you get from it was he used his administrative privileges to look the guy up and ask for his Bitcoin back? How is this wrong again? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:31:21
Wait what? I said skeptical, not opposed. I want to see it working, I want to understand how it doesn't become a proximation of the current banking industry. I have reservations, not a monopoly on understanding it. I don't want to rush LN. 
Its this kind of attitude that is driving the community to burn down. It's the, you are either with me or ignorant, with me or against me, with me or a scammer attitude. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:15:55
Who does Bitcoin Cash belong to in your mind?
If you change personal name to personal philosophy does it change what is rude?
If you change the personal name to favorite food name, does that make it not rude?

Thank for the excellent clarity of thinking here. Regardless of what you think on the btc /bcc issue, as a community let's not devolve into character assassination.

Holding dollars is more risky than crypto in VZ. Also more easily earned and transferable due to the regulations on the market.

It is about Lattes and it is about contraband. There isn't a choice there. It isn't about a "pure storage of value" for speculative trading.
