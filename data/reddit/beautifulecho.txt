Sounds a little socialist. Government spending tax dollars to mine crypto to offer services.

Old news.

Just tried it irl, didn’t work.

Yep. If bitcoin destabilises the US dollar - China and Japan will be unhappy (because they hold many bags). This will make World leaders blush and self destruct.

Fair effort. Good work.

Nope, Governments like to issue their own money. Their promise that it’ll be worth something is all that matters. So no to bitcoin, but a maybe to the amera-coin (I hope there isn’t one already)
