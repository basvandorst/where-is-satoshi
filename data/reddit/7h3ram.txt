tldr; I'm a Noble prize winner in Economics and I don't understand Bitcoin. It must be tulip bubble 2.0 and I'm sure it will crash in 100 years.

Yes, I know. I was reading [this]( thread the other day where it was mentioned and added it to bot. This could be totally unrelated to MtGox and sadly no way (yet) to verify. Better to be explicit so that community can collectively validate over time.

I didn't, used their code from github to create this. The script was running for a few hours before they took the site down and submitted a lot of fake seeds to the php script over Tor.

Care to comment on why it is not related to MtGox. I don't know for sure, but based on previous posts this could be related. If you think that's not the case let me know and I'll remove it from the bot.

This address was incorrectly identified as related to MtGox and as such this post. There was no ill intention behind the post. many thanks to those who took time to confirm validity of the address.

[Bitcoin Gold]( or BTG is an upcoming (25/Oct/2017 ~= block height 491407) "friendly" fork to move away from the heavily ASIC dependent SHA256-based mining process to Equihash-based GPU friendly alternative. This change will enable home users and enthusiasts to get involved in Bitcoin mining without heavily investing in ASIC hardware.
Since BTG mining process is ASIC resistant, it is not a threat for existing BTC miners. It has strong replay protection and unique address format that ensures people HODL'ing BTC before the fork can get an equal amount of BTG post-fork.

I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly. Are you asking if it will be possible to sell your BTC immediately after BTG fork? Yes, it certainly will be but it is not advisable to carry out transactions around a fork as the network might seem unstable. Give it a day or two, read more about the status of the fork and only if all seems well, go ahead with the sell.
You will have an equal amount of BTG post fork but it will take some work before you can use them. One thing to remember is that you would need to split your existing BTC and failure to do so before selling would mean they are also spent on the BTG blockchain.
So, again, wait for the fork to finish and things to settle down. Keep an eye on this reddit for the community to post updates and make an informed decision on whether and when to sell.
