This last year in crypto has been incredible and i hope that it has opened doors for each of you, whether it has enabled you to pay off debt, quit your job or even buy your dream car.
My own journey has been to quit my job and start a business. I have been working on my business now for 8 months and it has given me the freedom to spend more time with my baby boy. 
May 2018 be a prosperous year to all!

Not convinced with these gains. Almost 100% gain on your 401k? In one year? I call bs. What assets do you hold in your 401k that have appreciated by that amount? 
Fair enough, Bitcoin hold since last year would produce that return, but given the other gains across your portfolio which are questionable....I fail to trust any of it! My opinion only

Fair point. I guess that I could be wrong in assuming that the gains are fabricated. It obviously doesn't show the amount of funds deposited into each account during the period. The guy may not have made a 100% return on investment, but made a modest return whilst constantly topping up funds and buying steady amounts of Bitcoin during this growth phase.
I suppose there is not enough information to truly form an opinion.

I hold both Bitcoin and physical gold. Most gold traded is 'paper gold' or gold contracts sold by banks and traded by financial institutions in derivative options and futures. The amount of gold traded and held electronically is generally not all physically allocated, due to excessive leverage in the financial system. This means basically that if everyone who holds a gold ETF heads over to claim their physical counterpart in the event of monetary collapse or crisis, the central banks would not have enough gold to provide. That is the reason why I hold physical gold.
However as a hedge and store of value in times of trouble, gold can and will be attempted to be confiscated as it has been by the banks in the past. All assets of value will be stripped from the people when the banks are in trouble. This is a risk. The first gold to be confiscated is that which is half as paper contracts such as etf's. 
Bitcoin however can now qualify as a method of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. Real investors will not trust the banks with their wealth, and will move to Bitcoin for its lure of decentralised account.

A few people here coming to argue about which coin is best. I personally hold both bitcoin and eth. Both coins need constant developement to continue to grow. Both are at different maturity levels. Bitcoin is way more mainstream but i feel it may need to reivent itself as an internation investment as a hedge against traditional markets rather than to be used as a currency...that is until it forks and increases block sizes and lowers fees etc.
Eth needs alot more development and stability also. Its radical groeth will only cause difficulties in scaling. I fesr that it is growing a littke too fast for its own good. Also centralized leadership is dangerous. If vitalik gets sick...the price will plumet lol
Adoption is key for all crypto and the only way is to join together and promote each other, so everyone can benefit. Fo example...the whole crypto ecosystem is bonded to the bitcoin price...when bitcoin is sold off...it drops all other coins with it. We need to support bitcoin.
I believe this so strongly that i have helped my friends businesses set up bitcoin payments. I also allow coinbase payments on my website  
Together we all win!

Love the bitcoin community and have been a holder now since June 2016. 
For our community to grow, like any currency or method of exchange we need to circulate and create trust.
I have worked with a few businesses, mainly family and friends and helped them enable Bitcoin payments.
