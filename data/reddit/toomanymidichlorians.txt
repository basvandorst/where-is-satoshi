I highly doubt it, since paypal is not Korea-friendly, for two reasons:  1) Koreans are very nationalistic, so the govt makes laws that people can only use Korean apps/programs/whatever for lots of things (and the people prefer Korean ones over non-Korean ones anyway), and 2) Korean banks allow bank transfers (American banks don't without a lot of hassle, headaches and fees), so there's really no need for something like paypal.

I'm lucky I'm in Korea, I just do a direct bank transfer to korbit

Is Airbitz (which is included in your infographic) not considered quality? I had to reset my phone last week and had no backup of my Airbitz wallet, but after inputting all my info everything was safe and sound.
