Good to know. Good to know. 
Ziplocks are a must.

sure there is. 
Theoretically if i possessed one bitcoin address with a million bucks worth of bitcoin on it, the process for sending it to another bitcoin address is the same as sending a dollar worth of bitcoin, or one bitcoin or a hundred. Same little transaction fee.
The markets are affected by BUYING AND SELLING bitcoin on exchanges, not transferring from one address to another. Someone may see the transaction on the blockchain and say, 'WTF look at that big ol' transfer', and it would have a minimal emotional effect on the market for a short period of time. 
Does that answer your question?

I agree. My paper wallet storage game is weak as fuck. Fire proof safe for Xmas maybe??

Yes! a tipbot the DAY AFTER it's released publicly?
Now if somebody made a twitter tip bod for COYE, we could send some to the man himself.

Ahh gotcha. I had your username wrong....sorry bud.
Sidechains are interesting as they'll have the underlying security and stability of the blockchain. That's the consensus at least. I trust that the final decision won't be a half-measure like you mentioned above:


Sidechains and ethereum are unproven technologies but very interesting as an option as long as it has a secure and stable blockchain. What are your thoughts on ethereum?

I admit my storage method is shit. 
Your comment is hilarious! I'm picturing a neckbeard in his mom's basement just bashing things together to make a fire while cursing everyone with a paper wallet.

for a person paying for a coffee? Yes it's no more convenient than a debit card or whatever. 
Trying to safely store it? It's a bit shitty so far, but will probably get better sooner than later. 
For transferring a million dollars to another country for virtually no cost. Yea it's pretty fuckin convenient.
****side note, i saw an ad for western union claiming you can send up to $1k from Canada to the Philippines for ONLY $30!! I had to chuckle a bit.

I can't tell if you're trying to be funny or if you're just another fuckin stupid asshole on the internet.
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:42:15

The owner of the Sandman hotel group is Billionaire Bob Gaglardi who also owns the Dallas Stars and other property and businesses in Canada and the US. 
Yet another sign that if these billionaires are accepting it and are jumping on the train, others will soon follow suit.

San Francisco or in the Bay Area
