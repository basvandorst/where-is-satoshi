I just met with a tax attorney today and asked him for his opinion on bitcoin. He said "it's just a fad," and that he heard "their servers went down the other day". Lol.

I agree this doesn't address the issue of fiat.  But if the value of bitcoin lies partly in its ability to allow quick, cheap p2p transactions, why wouldn't bitcoin's value be severely affected by the coming of these Clinkle-like apps? 
For the demand of bitcoin to increase in the US, and assuming these up and coming technologies allow for quick p2p transactions as does bitcoin, we would have to assume that much of the population cares about the non-fiat, decentralized nature of bitcoin. While I wish this were true, quite frankly most of the population could care less.

Thanks. I'll look into this now. To redeem their bitcoin, will they have to manually type in all the characters in the key?

You have to use KindleKoinz

You're right. Not even bitcoin. But if this app charges even a small fee to withdraw money from your bank into "Clinkle Cash," you are then free to transact with this amount as you please without any fees.

I like the way you think.

Cash out what you need to live comfortably for one year if you were to suddenly go bankrupt tomorrow. Keep the rest in BTC. We're all firm believers here.

I think there are some sophisticated competitors coming along in the near future... we may have to wait until we see a little more price stability but I don't think Mt.Gox will be the leader once more sophisticated parties get involved

I don't think $100k will crash the market
