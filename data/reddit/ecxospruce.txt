The discussion has increased because so much new tethers have been created.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:16:09
Because it is impossible to redeem the dollars, because they do not have them.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:53:50
Is it time to turn off the exchanges for a while? How about printing some tether?
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:00:22
Other way around, it collapsed because of the downturn.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:19:04
Literally? Where do you live?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:27:27
Today we have Tether

Who is he trying to pander to?

Who are you going to fight against?

Me too, I sold... 
all my bitcoins and bought a skateboard ramp.

11500 has a big buy wall but we will see how long it lasts...

This actually happened in Albania and they had a mini civil war.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:19:15
It is a bit like fake Satoshi, Mr. Wright. They could prove it conclusively, but refuse to do it. Why?
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:14:49
People understand that the whole crypto market is overvalued.
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:08:28
Why do you even use the sarcasm tag when you write like that?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:48:54
Tether just printed more fake money, bump incoming.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:48
Broke the 10000 wall in Gdax on the fourth try.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:20:29
I do not think the market cap will drop that much.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:06:22
I think this will be 100x worse than bitconnect. I have actually stopped any new buys because this looks like such a gigantic fraud that pumps up prices all around. When tether implodes we will have a healthier market. 
I have zero faith that they have the dollars they claim to have.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:12:27
You are creating strawmen, Ethereum was not "brought to its knees" unless you think Bitcoin was buried six feet under too.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:38:21
It is always the same except the first time it is not...
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:45:48
People keep saying that, but in real stocks with efficient markets things like this are reflected in the price a long time before the release. Why do you think this is not the case with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:01:55
I think there is a stronger correlation with another 100 million of tetheral reserve money being printed half an hour prior to the bump.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:14:09
Who is "they"?
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:29:59
Here we go, below 12k. Gdax going straight down.

Alt coins are going down a lot too, people dumping them for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:17
There is something missing in this story
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:20:06
It is an old idea in economics that describes very well what is happening. It is not necessarily negative, do not let the name fool you.

No, Bill Gates has an estimated wealth of 80 billion. Of course if he suddenly wanted to sell all the value would crash, but so it would for Satoshi too.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:36:02
This is called arbitrage, in a mature market it does not happen as much. The fees and transaction delays make it difficult to take advantage of.

During the dotcom bubble you could triple your company value by adding .com to the name. 
During the bitcoin bubble, you could make your coin explode in value by using the name bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:16:53
No, you!
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:24:30
This always raises the question why the markets are so ineffective in bitcoin, arbitrage fixes this quickly in normal markets.

50€ is nothing unless you live in sub saharan africa. Go for it, even though a big crash looks likely.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:13:01
In many countries if you take a loss you can deduct it from taxes, so kinda yes. This is why many people buy Bitcoin ETNs.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:26
Almost at 200k pending transactions.

Am I missing a joke here? Should I delete my messages?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:28:29
Back to slightly more than beginning of the year. It is not a given that it will happen at all, but I think 2000 would be a true crash. I am pessimistic.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:50:13
Wow, you are in denial. This is not a cult.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:01:48
The thing is that r/bitcoin users are also very uniformed about bitcoin and economics.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:00:37
No-one knows why it went up either
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:23:59
This has happened multiple times this month and its the 9th. Small speculative markets have wide swings.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:20:36
Other coins do the same thing better, more privately etc.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:23:51
I do not have a crystal ball, but I have been hearing about an imminent economic crash that will turn the world into Mad Max since the early 2000's, I am not convinced.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:23:47
Bitcoin already has this and it is often way worse
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:02:05
What you are doing sounds illegal...
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:13:54
The thing is that many of the alts are better than bitcoin as a currency, it would kill the cryptocurrency thing if they all die. Bitcoin has the enormous network effects working for it, but altcoins work and scale better if many people want to buy items.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:58:01
I agree that people like to gloat, but it has been a clear bubble for a while. Tea companies are changing their name to contain "blockchain" and their stocks rise, it is the dotcom bubble all again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:18:23
You are asking in a pro-bitcoin forum, what do you think?
(I think the current price is not based on reality, aka adoption, but pure speculation. Timing the market is a luck based game. Nobody can give you advice, go with your gut feeling.)
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:05:56
We can throw all economics in the garbage bin, bitcoin is a more important invention than cooking with fire.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:38:41
Do you realize how irresponsible this is? There are a lot of people who might actually be reckless enough to do this and who do not understand sarcasm.

This is a silly argument, just using the electricity directly would be more effective for heating.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:42:05
Bitcoin is a speculative thing these days, most people never use it for anything. Altcoins are what you are looking for. Ethereum is actually being used, even though cryptokitties are silly.

The guy prints so much money to appease his allies that the cash is worth less than the paper it is printed on, this is not a positive development and his coin is a joke.

This is not really Bitcoin related, but you refusing to sell has no impact on the price, things can be worth zero even if people refuse to sell them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:39:32
I know it looks like a big drop, but you have to take into consideration that it has risen so much this week. 
If the crashening happens, it will be over 50% in a day, not 15%.

Tesla is the car that bitcoin people always refer to, I was speaking generally. Yaris is a great car too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:58:03
That makes no sense. Of course they would sell you games for a currency that will grow in value, the buyer would be an idiot to buy. They just think the problems outweight the gains right now.

Probably a scrapyard. How old is it?

How is Ethereum having major problems? They just had one million transactions in a day with way less fees and waiting then Bitcoin. Is this a troll?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:47:18
Satoshi is dead. You have to worry about this when they find out how to reanimate cryogenically frozen corpses.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:36:56
People think they can sell it later for more.

Helium is an unusual element because it reaches escape velocity if released. However, the balloon weights enough to stop it reaching space and it will stop somewhere in the upper atmosphere.
If bitcoin is helium, popping the bubble or balloon around it will allow it to reach space and possibly the moon.

@_date: 2017-12-09 16:54:37
It is just fine and does not happen much in mature markets. In bitcoin the fees and transaction delays make it difficult to do, it is theoretically free money but hard to take advantage of.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:17:41
Yep, their stock has gone up like crazy today. Insane.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:18:04
No. What will crash bitcoin is when people realize how rarely it is actually used as a currency.

* I do not know much about Tether
* Ethereum excites me greatly and the community is less infested by memes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:17:02
There are so many opportunities for arbitrage but I guess the transaction backlog and fees stop people from benefiting from it, just shows how immature the market is.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:26:22
Yes, you can make money by investing. You could also make instant loss with any investment.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:43:48
Full non-archival nodes can validate just as well, full history is not needed for security. They just compute it instead of storing.
However, full nodes will eventually be too big too, sharding is the buzzword to fix it.

If no-one wants to buy them at the "max price", you have to lower the price until someone does buy it. I suggest you study the basics of investing before you even think about bitcoin.
