Ok thank you that answers my question. 
What were the news from china?
I will keep them for a few month probably and see where bitcoins are going to. Maybe investing another 64€ just to see what happens. I hope this is getting a big thing like Apple or paypal because then I would have some nice cash. If not then I lost a few bucks. No big deal in both ways. Did you bought some bitcoins?

I did it for a similar reason. 
Thank you for replying.

Naww I will stay chilled. Like I said. I thought through this and 64€ won't hurt me or my wallet. If I fail I can say that it was fun. If I win I buy a Subaru. Win-Win situation.

I only invested 64€ because I know it wouldn't hurt my wallet if I lose them. I do this to take look and to have a little bit fune because it is interesting and thrilling. I always thought to invest in stocks but never really knew in which. Now I saw that the bitcoins rised up like motherfuckers in the past month and thought that I am gonna buy them. Anyways even if I am losing it then it is okay. I calculated that into my transaction. 
No I don't really regret anything I just want to know if this was the possibly worst time to invest in bitcoins. Now I'm gonna look up the 'stocks' everyday and follow them.

I know what bitcoins are and I believe that if I keep them for a while like 6 month then I will make some money. This is something 'new' that will rise like PayPal or Apple. I know how stocks work and I don't think that this is any different. Am I right or am I terrible wong?
