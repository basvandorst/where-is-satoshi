I'm not affiliated with them in any way. Just like how it's looking and working, and they're some friendly guys over email.

They say [here]( that they're implementing stealth addresses soon. But I agree, it'd be better if you could define your own address.

This is a cool site. I hadn't heard of it until now. But I have I can stick a fully verified flag on my name (twitter, Facebook, github)

I have private bitcoin addresses and now I have a public one too. 
I have a private reddit name and a public one too. Same thing.

That's what 'the other client' does, it allows miners/nodes to set their own max block size. The 2MB thing is just for starters.

The question is do we want the transaction reward to go up by increased fees or more users. Increasing fees reduces the number of users, whereas increasing number of transactions allowed would increase the number of users and fees.
0.1B * 10 transactions or 0.001B * 1000 transactions both make the same amount, but in the second case the network has more utility

Segwit doesn't kick in in one flip of a switch though, it'll be dependent on how many people are sending segwit transactions and that may take time to build up

It works fine, I just don't know whether any data is collected during running. 
Chrome only got the upgrade recently which allows it to run apks, so this is pretty new.
