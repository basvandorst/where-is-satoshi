If theres an upward trend to 100k or whatever, I think buying 1000 or 2000 higher or whatever won't be one of my big concerns.
On the contrary, I may be more than a little uncomfortable if BTC plunges to 4000 tomorrow and 2000 the next day. I've been watching those "walls" crumble away day after day. I'm curious what the bottom is on this thing.

I literally bought low 2 years ago and am still selling 30x above what I had. It just could have been more like 80x what I had. 
But by all means, believe your delusions.

Definitely not what I said. The mindless comments that anyone who is proceeding cautiously must be "buying high, selling low" "locking in their losses" and so on are the point of my criticism.

Interesting stuff happening rn.

Exactly this man. Theres some fishy shit going on and I am curious where it will go. I don't need to blow money to figure it out though. Once the waters aren't so muddy I can figure out what to do next.

Yeah so I didn't lose my house or anything but definitely lost a few chances to clock out at a higher level like a lot of other people. Ultimately I'm done here with 66% less than I could have done. Lucky for me I had some leftover bitcoin from a transaction 2 years ago so I am still up 30x what I had 2 years ago in BTC.
If the market ever swings up I'll probably hop back in but for now its just too unstable.
