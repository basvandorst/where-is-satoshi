How did you set this up?

That's an excellent app. It even supports NFC for compatible hardware (like Google Wallet). 
And to bolster your last sentence with an analogy: you wouldn't cash out your entire checking account and stuff it all in the wallet you carry in your pocket every day. Think of your mobile wallet the same way. It's just for "walking around" money.

I give up.

I received this email as well. I think this is the one that was sent to Dwolla users who set up a recurring Dwolla payment from their bank account.

Did I say what my current behavior was? Buffett's point (I'll say it again since you missed it) is that speculative greed is not what should inform your decision to buy or sell. If you're in before the bubble and you believe the investment is solid enough to grow into the future beyond the inevitable crash, then hold and wait. If you want to buy, wait until sanity returns to the market (again, assuming the investment is worth the wait).

This is what Camp BX support says has a "high failure rate" and therefore should not be used.

While an active and healthy bitcoin exchange market (not just a BTC/fiat one) is definitely a good thing to develop, "hoarding" as you call it (austro-libertarians would call it "saving") also needs to be a foundation of its growth. Think about what saving implies: buying and holding (i.e. not selling off in a mass panic), investing capital, and fueling a less volatile, broader economy (where a wide array of goods and services are exchanged). 
TL;DR: "Saving"--not "hoarding"--and it's a good thing.

I just received the same email. Has MtGox released any information about this?

When a member of the financial system says "disrupting the financial system," I hear "putting our government-enforced cartel of privatized profits and socialized losses at risk of legitimate competition."

Yeah, I discovered that as well. Got that set up and it's humming along just fine. The problem for me is that I like Camp BX's interface and feature set, but if I can't reliably get money in there (I've even had one "non-pending" Dwolla transfer "disappear"), I can't use it.

For those who believe that bitcoin has a higher long-term valuation and that the current "bubble" will simply be a bump in the road, yes.

But watching the volumes of the average trade, they're usually pretty small. I'm inclined to think that this rise was fueled by a lot of newcomers who put in a little money "just to try it out." That could mean that the correction is not long lived since people aren't losing their shirts, and may be invigorated and ready to jump in again with a small amount when the price drops.

“[S]imply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”
--Warren Buffet
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:26:41
I think that's the point: "fear" (define that however you want) is what makes prices fall. When prices fall, a particular investment may become more attractive to the investor looking for more concrete, long-term value. On the other hand, widespread greed is what drives the speculative, irrational spikes regardless of the underlying value of the investment.

I see. I guess you're using Dwolla's "Minimum balance" feature to auto-fund from your bank account? I don't see any other way to auto-fund Dwolla.

This is more of an excuse to play around with python than anything else. If you have any recommendations for making it better, more useful, more efficient, etc., I'd be happy to learn something new.
