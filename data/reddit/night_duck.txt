Also relate. Buying a 2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid in a month with crypto

I'm planning on divesting half of my crypto in a month to buy a car, so this really hits home.

I was actually surprised that his tweet had no effect whatsoever on crypto prices

Also the banks don't print money. The federal reserve grants then a "loan" by permitting them to increase the number on their balance sheets. There's no physical printing of money.
Honestly that's even worse because it not only increases inflation, it reduces the liquidity of commercial banks.
Monetary economics is a lot more complicated than "fiat bad"

This is just false. Uber owns self driving cars. Facebook does create original shows. And Alibaba has their own warehouses.

Idk about Airbnb, but there other 3 are definitely false.

Bitcoin core is open source. Write a commit and start a public outcry to have it merged. Bitcoin has added new functionality in the past

They're like $30. It's ridiculous enough. You don't have to exaggerate

Is this about the price slowing down or the clunky technology?
@_date: 2019-10-15 15:04:01
Technically yes, but in the same way that off shore bank accounts are unaffected by bankruptcy. Still highly illegal to hide your money there, but it's one way to do it. But good luck buying millions of dollars in Bitcoin not through Coinbase.

I'd don't have 100k lol. Sorry to leave that impression. And I'd still be very upset to see my retirement savings go, but I'm young, so it's easy to save it up again
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:07:34
Probably won't replace the USD anytime soon. But maybe the Chinese Yuan. China is where Bitcoin is most popular. And given the impending rate hike in the US FED, could mean inflation in China in the next few years. Coupled with the increasing rate of household debt in China (American household debt was one of the triggers of the 2007 recession), an economic crisis is possible, so the Chinese might flock to crypto.

Depending on what you count as money, BTC can only go up another 8-70x before it overtakes the monetary base of USD.
Harsh truth: that $1k you have in Bitcoin probably won't ever buy you a lambo.

Their AI probably went on a fake news binge, and lot of the more scammy crypto channels fell under that blanket

I was going to do this yesterday. Then I realized the transaction fees are more than the item

This. It's like how we conflate "World Wide Web" and "Internet" because the WWW is basically the only thing we use the internet for anymore. In third world countries, they only ever use the WWW through FB's in-app browser, so to them, it's all "Facebook"

Email, Netflix, Skype are all accessed from the browser nowadays, and I think WhatsApp still uses regular HTTP queries for all but its P2P communication.
Torrents/BTC/AWS are good examples, but not exactly visible to the normies

It was shared on the initial concern. I forgot the Communcations Decency Act was a thing (ie fb isn't guilty of porn you put on your profile). I did a fake news :(

OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE?? Seriously tho, is this covered by the Communications Decency Act (hosting providers aren't liable for the content of their users)? Or do we all have to run light wallets until the last full node goes down?

Step 1: Find an altcoin with an innovative feature, like ring signatures
Step 2: Copy and paste their code into your own project
