I'm afraid only public torrents are supported at the moment. I might add support for private trackers later, but in that case I don't think there is a way around having to provide the credentials to Coinado.

I don't know yet, to be honest. I'm trying to find out what mix of bandwidth and privacy most users would prefer (i.e. tor privacy + less bandwidth or open web privacy + more bandwidth). Tor bandwidth will be provided for whatever has been used so far, but if I decide to continue running the hidden service, I realized that I will probably have to charge a bit more for that to make it work.

The maximum seed time of 12 hours is fixed at the moment, yes. What would you prefer instead?

For every 1 GB of data you transfer via Coinado another 10 GB are provided to the Tor network (to take into account the overhead of a hidden service). So arguably, this increases the health of the Tor network. ;-)

Currently there is no way to get a status for a torrent, I'll probably add something like that though. throwawayne17 is correct in saying, that the file is transferred to you as it is being downloaded. So usually it will keep hanging for the first few seconds or minutes until the beginning of the file is there and then the first pieces of data will arrive.
You can resume a download in the sense that HTTP range requests are supported, so you can jump to a specific part of the file and continue from there. But Coinado only downloads a certain window ahead of what you have requested so far. So if you provide it with a new torrent, it will not download it completely right away, but only something from the beginning and wait until that's transferred to you. So your idea to start, pause and resume will work, but when you resume only a part of the torrent will be ready.
In practice I personally have found, that the wget download usually hangs or is very slow for the first few minutes or so and then the torrent process has progressed enough that it downloads new data quicker than Tor can transfer it and then Tor becomes the bottleneck.
If you have a very poorly seeded torrent, than Bittorrent might become the bottleneck. Currently you would just have to let the wget process run for a while. For these situations I might add the feature of having Coinado first download everything and then you can come back and get it in one go, but that's not possible yet.

I'm afraid that's not possible at the moment. I might add something like that, but in most cases the bottleneck is Tor, so it wouldn't really speed things up much.

Bitcoin is the only payment option for this service, which allows for very fine-grained pricing - you pay only for the bandwidth you use. 
Seeing as Bitcoin is a key factor in enabling this service, I figured this subreddit would be interested in it.


Yes, at the moment only public torrents are supported. But if there is interest for private torrents, I'm happy to look into supporting them!


$12 would get you 120 GB of data with Coinado (a part of your payment goes towards supporting the Tor network with more bandwidth). I'd say if you are a heavy torrent user, you are better of with a seedbox. If you just torrent occasionally, the pay-as-you-go approach of Coinado is probably cheaper for you and also means you don't need to spend time figuring out a seedbox setup.
Coinado also lends itself better to integration. For example, if you torify something like VLC, you can just open the link ' info hash here&gt;/auto' in the video player and it can start playing the video, provided it can stream fast enough. Everything is just HTTP - you can also seek to random positions in the movie and the download will continue from there. This should make it easy to write plugins for something like Kodi (think: Popcorn time interface, but with the anonymity of Tor), but that's something for the future.

At the moment I don't, I'm afraid, but I am considering offering a clearnet version for those who like a different mix of bandwidth and privacy. I'll make another announcement then, if I should start offering that.

Thanks! I will take a look at better supporting Windows in the future. But if you don't mind some copy-pasting, you can also get the Tor browser bundle for Windows and just paste the links into the address bar. To automatically select the largest file from the torrent and just download that use a link of this form:
     info hash here&gt;/auto
To select a specific file from the torrent, use a search term that will match on the filename:
     info hash here&gt;/search/&lt;search term&gt;
After some buffering, the Tor browser should then start downloading the file.

Any file can be download this way. But yes, 'streaming' in the sense of being able to watch something while it is still being downloaded of course only applies to media files.

I2P has few users and therefore few torrents to offer, I'd say. Coinado is a gateway to the much larger world of torrents on clearnet.

Yes, that's possible - that is how it will work, once the free trial is over.

Thank you! Regarding a zip archive: Indeed, I'm planning to add something like that, haven't gotten around to it yet.
Interesting point regarding the .torrent file - I'll think about it!
