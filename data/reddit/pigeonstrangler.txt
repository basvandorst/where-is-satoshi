I've been watching since the highs in late 2017.  With 85% knocked off the value it's very tempting to buy in now.  Although, nobody really knows if it's going up or down in value I think it's worth the risk from my point of view.  If I lose £3600 fair enough it didn't pay off.  But if Bitcoin goes on a bull run it could pass 10k again, or more, and so the reward v reward makes it a buy in my mind.

Interestingly Italy are passing laws to protect their gold.  Maybe they fear an economic meltdown, who knows, but they're protecting their physical gold.  I do think the price of gold will soar in the years ahead.  However, buying a 10oz bar would wipe me out so I feel it's an asset class too expensive for me to get involved in.

Buying a whole host of alts seems like throwing darts at a board to me.  I think if crypto is going to gain mass adoption Bitcoin will be the one to do it.

Buying a Bitcoin would be about 20% of my overall investment cash.

I'm just trying to get a feel as to where the sentiment is on here.  I obviously anticipate biased answers and will take that in to consideration.
Personally, I think the global economy will run in to trouble this year or next and I can see people turning to things such as Bitcoin.  If I had the cash I'd probably buy a gold bar instead but sadly not.

I've never bought gold before.  I have wondered what mechanisms are in place for selling them.  Most outlets seem to give you 'scrap value'.  It's not an asset I know a lot about but I do not that when the paper currency and stocks fall gold starts doing the opposite.

I'm saying - "The price is plummeting. Less that £5k now. That's the lowest it's been since November 2017".
