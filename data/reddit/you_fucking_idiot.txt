Slavery literally has to be involuntary, if he's doing it willingly and getting paid at his job, how the fuck can he be defined as a slave? Did you just watch like a Youtube video or some movie that is making you so smug? 
Edit: oh shit, you're that idiot from the other thread. I keep getting drawn to your comments, my username must be like a dowsing rod. 
Now I'm starting to think you might be between 13 and 15, and 99% sure you're developmentally slow.. Sorry man, it's gonna be a tough road ahead for you

If anyone is wondering why Casinos have that room in the back where you can sell them your whole house as collateral and thought "who the fuck would do that?", it's this guy right here.

Read my username one more time and you'll understand why.

Sorry pal, but cash on its own is not inflationary, supply and demand will affect purchasing power, but the "worth" remains the same, unless you know something about math that I don't where 1 unit of debt suddenly doesn't equal 1. $20 bill is still $20 worth of debt, despite inflation. And since our methods of production have become cheaper and more competitive, our dollar has more buying power. You can get way more food for $1 today than you could 10 years ago. People made less money, but $1 is still $1,  what you can do with it changes but the value remains unaltered, 1 unit of debt note. How do you not understand that? For fucks sake

exactly, I said the same thing and got crucified. I got 10 free bcash from coinbase and i cashed out 2 seconds later. I can't hate something I made $20k in 2 seconds from. I might not support it over another thing, but it's not the end of the world.

Come on, don't sound that stupid. You know that's not the case, and if you don't, just shut the fuck up, please. You're making everyone else a little dumber and it's not helping anyone.
Math isn't illegal, selling something of value and not paying taxes or following laws is illegal. Bitcoin doesn't get exempt from state and federal laws overnight just because you decided a few weeks ago that's what you wanted.

Hmm... So what you're saying is that cash only has value because we believe in it, but as long as we believe in BTC, it will have value. Sounds like this whole thread is full of fucking idiots, no offense. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:39:46
Sorry but I guess my mental gymnastics aren't as flexible as they used to be, it's just really hard to relate to stupid lines of logic. You said something so fucking stupid I must have completely missed what you were saying, even though I quoted and broke it down for you and why it's a stupid sentence. I see now what you meant, even though it's fundamentally idiotic and not really though out to be an example because it's not true or valid in anyway. I mean, I can take a 3rd stab at trying to simplify, but I'm afraid I'll end up trapped in the 1st dimension with you. 
One more time: What you said is "Why would a business accept cash if it's worth less in the future.?" implying that inflation lowers the value of money over time. But what you don't realize is that money isn't sitting in a vault, it's reinvested or moved or transferred or burned in a large money fire. That money never loses value, it's already spent or will be spent long before that particular piece of tender loses BUYING POWER, not value. If 1 + 1 = 2, in 20 years $1+$1 will still equal $2, but what you can buy with $2 might change. In recent history, buying power is up depending on where you are. The entire planet != the US. So in some places, businesses make money by accepting US cash, which is something you didn't consider in your small minded, teeny tiny thought bubble of isolated theories. Yes, in a vacuum, you might sound like you had a point to a 5th grader.
But my point remains, businesses accept cash not because of any value or worth, they do it because they have no fucking other choice, you dingus.
I literally can't explain that enough to you, but I will try and maybe it'll sink in. Your comment only works in a country where cash isn't legally required to be accepted. Now do you get why it's stupid to say such a simple thing about such a complicated thing? Yes? No?

Samurai used this technique. It's a self inflicted hernia. Granted, almost all hernias are self inflicted one way or another, but they practice getting them back out.

The 99% do the voting, you can't blame anyone but yourself in a democracy. If half the population want this, either from ignorance or spite, you can either leave or get rich and make some changes. If you think poor people should be allowed to make financial decisions for an entire nation, I highly suggest you get a book and start reading, you've got a lot of history to cover, like all the way back to cavemen.

Holy shit this is fucking stupid... That's not what he's saying, he's saying it's making it possible to obtain drugs with bitcoins that can't be traced, not that bitcoins killed your cousin... You and your cousin are both fucking stupid.

You mean brand new. How expensive do you think they are? A 2018 fully loaded might set you back 280k, but a brand new 2015 or less won't be more than 100k unless you're getting ripped off.

You don't actually know what money is, do you? Every dollar you "own" is a debt owed to the government. It's their money, you are using it to settle exchanges for goods or services. No one is stopping you from trading your car for a goat, which you totally could. 
If you want to use the governments services like not being raped and pillaged by invading Mongolians, you can't really complain unless you're willing to find a better solution, which you aren't so what are you even trying to say?
