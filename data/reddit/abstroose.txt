I've been able to log in, first try, all day.. until about 20 mins ago when I got an email to notify me that my deposit had been completed. I've tweeted them and emailed support but no response yet.

At one point I had about 40 BTC. Cashed out at around $1000. Nowadays I hold on to about 3-5 at a time.

Looks cool! Just sent 0.0065 BTC your way.

The few times that I've had to provide passport scans online (Bitstamp, BitFinex, Transferwise etc) I've always watermarked the shit out of them as well as censored a few things such as the Passport number, signature etc. They don't need any of those parts so there should be no problem.
Nevertheless, that's what I'd do when it's pretty much essential. For hosting I wouldn't do it out of principle. I'd reply with your Bitcoin address and kindly ask them for a refund.

Such an awesome video. I've been involved in Bitcoin for some time and had no idea of the possibilities it holds. A great example of why the monetary value is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:03:40
Yep, just got an email to confirm too.
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:11:49
Yup, driving me nuts too. Just got the email that my deposit has been completed and can't even log in. I've logged in about 6 times today just fine, and now I can't, despite trying well over 30 times in the last 15 mins.

Can you please give me a bit more info on Dell? I'm trying to take my privacy seriously nowadays but wasn't aware Dell were bad guys.

I guess irrelevant wasn't the best word. What I mean is, when people claim that Bitcoin is failing when there's a dip in price, or crash. When they dropped from $1k to $400 the number of people I heard, smugly, claiming that Bitcoin was just a scam with their 'I told you so' attitude was ridiculous, as if that's the only thing Bitcoin is about.

Good job. For future reference: [Online OCR](

I'm guessing so. I trade on LocalBitcoins and yesterday the going price there was BitstampUSD + ~35%. I can only assume that these crazy prices are due to a lot of trader's fiat being in limbo.

I understand, but I mean you would have created a deposit on Bitstamp for the first amount you sent, right? You can send another right now, and then when the first deposit is credited (perhaps later today), simply create a second deposit of the amount you've already sent. I'm doing the same thing right now.. Sent one SEPA transfer last Thursday and another yesterday. As soon as the first deposit is cleared I'll create another one for the second amount immediately.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:06:06
Do you mind sharing what method of deposit you're using for same day credits? The absolute minimum I get with SEPA transfers is the next working day.

I stopped using Bitstamp after their 'banking software issues' a couple of weeks ago. It wasn't just the fact that it took them over a week (compared to the usual 24hrs) to credit my deposit, a delay which cost me a couple of thousand dollars. I was more upset by how they handled it. They ignored all support tickets and emails for at least 72 hours. They ignored Facebook posts, messages, forum posts. They're normally a good exchange, but they have no idea when it comes to customer service, and they lost me as a customer for that reason. Having a lot of money in limbo like that, with their entire support ignoring you and not a phone number to call, is not a reassuring experience!

You could leave it running 24 hours a day and you probably wouldn't even make back 1% of the electricity cost.

You'll never be able to buy Bitcoins via debit/credit card; exchanges would just be inviting fraudsters to cash out with stolen card data.
Find a trustworthy seller on LocalBitcoins, make a national bank transfer and receive your BTC same day. There's plenty of decent traders on there, including myself whom provides all my business details and phone number etc to ensure trust in buyers.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:57:31
That's ridiculous. They can't just 'rule the dispute in favour of the buyer' and reverse all funds. This isn't a PayPal dispute. This is a bank that holds YOUR money. You're permitted to make any legal transactions, purchases and sales that you wish. Purchase and sales of goods is in no interest of your bank - their job is just to safely look after your money. They can't stick their nose in and 'rule in favour' of the buyer or seller. You need to speak to someone tonight and make that clear, otherwise get to a branch first thing tomorrow. They have no right right to take your money away from you because of their failed fraud prevention.

My thoughts exactly. I was actually looking for a 'cool' way I could give some friends and family a Bitcoin wallet with some funds for Christmas. I'd probably be happy to pay $20-$35 for each of them.

Bitstamp accept deposit via AstroPay, which I believe is an online payment solution for South American residents. Check it out:

They posted on Facebook and in their news section that they're experiencing problems with their banking software, so deposits and withdrawals are currently delayed.
I also have a large sum of fiat in limbo right now. I have an open support ticket, 27 hours unanswered and counting. They don't respond via email, nor to messages on Facebook. I've only ever had good things to say about Bitstamp, but this has really made me lose confidence in them. You'd expect much better customer support from a company that is handling tens of thousands of your dollars every day. I can't imagine what their staff do all day that make it so difficult to respond to support tickets and emails in a reasonable timeframe?

Also done this several times. As soon as the first deposit is credited into my account, I just create a new deposit with the amount I already sent.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:01:57
Also, just a word of advice. I trade frequently on LocalBitcoins and, regardless of feedback, enforce my own rules on trades. For purchases over £500 I want to see a scan of the bank card associated with the name of the bank account and LB account; for purchases over £1000 I want to see a scan of their Driver's License or Passport. Most people don't have a problem with providing them and I make it pretty clear in the trade description. Better to protect yourself for unfortunate cases like this.

You should look at registering with Bitstamp. You'll need to provide some ID scans and wait a few days to get verified. You can then make a SEPA deposit which can take a day or two. I use Barclay's and if I make a transfer before 2:30pm it's usually credited to my account within 24 hours, although Bistamp are experiencing problems with deposits and withdrawals right now, but it won't hurt to register and upload your ID now.
BTC-E is another option. You can make a deposit via International Bank Wire to them (which again, in my experience, was credited within 1 working day). Only problem I had with them is that they didn't request ID verification until I had bought my Bitcoins and wants to withdraw them to a cold wallet. Their English support is minimal and took about a week to get verified.
A third option is LocalBitcoins. You could get your Bitcoins via National Bank Transfer within the hour. You'll pay slightly more than the market price for them, but you won't have to go through the hassle of ID verification, international payments and then multiple currency exchange rates and bank fees. Probably better for buying smaller amounts.

You're out of luck, I'm afraid. That account number and sort code are most likely somebody else's. He'll be long gone and there's nothing you can do about it now. Bitcoin and eBay/PayPal transactions are just bad news. I also had to learn the hard way when I was scammed of £1500. Stick with escrow and secure exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:56:07
Any update on this? I've had just under £100k go in and out of my Barclays account via Bitstamp, BTC-E and LocalBitcoins trades in the past month and had no problems at all.
