I think Overstock already announced BTC payments:

...having just finished their act BTC walks closer and asks the Drug Cartel Guy and HSBC, "That's an interesting act, what do you call yourselves?"
DCG+HSBC: "**The Aristocrats!**"

a flotation tank qualifies you as "out there"??

even back when when BTC was around $100...or even $500?? I kindly disagree, in fact prices have relatively stabilized for the time being. I dont know if its just the Silk Road BTC dump looming but I would think up to this point in history back then was literally the most profitable time.

Drug cartel guy: "Bitcoin's Rectum?!?"
HSBC: "Recked 'em? I fukin' killed 'em!"

...until that also gets regulated

I hear that alot and it makes sense but someone also mentioned in another post that this is false because if you track the major difficulty spikes it is inline with delivery dates (of miners). does anyone know of any proof that mining companies actually use the miners for profit, not testing, before delivery?

HSBC to BTC: "Because they wont have credit in the future either!"
sorry, I couldnt resist. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:50:01
I partially agree. but I think part of the issue is that the printing machine will cease to make any money very quickly due to the difficulty increases and power-on timing, while something like buying BTC will (theoretically) rise in value continually? Sorry, if I misinterpreted.

might be misunderstanding but I fail to see how *anything* in Wells Fargo's interests (regulations etc) would align with me or anyone I knows interests
btw, last time I checked BTC was doing fine without Wells Fargo, regulations....Kanye?
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:26:15
do you think this is necessary at this point because of BTC regular price fluctuations? I always wonder how they come up with prices for goods/services based in BTC.
 (just overcharge by "x"%?)

How many people think resuming Bitcoin transfers is a possible reality? Seems like a big chance to buy low if its true

I respectfully disagree. (That he shouldn't have to follow the rules)
