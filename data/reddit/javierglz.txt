If I'm not wrong, he paid like 1 USD. What would you get at the strip club for that amount?.

Does anyone know of a good online store for Hi Fi Audio that takes BTC and does worldwide shipping?.
I've been trying to get my hands on a Turntable and some speakers and I found them on Newegg; sadly, I discovered Newegg won't take BTC...

I'm not sure. It's my first time trying Newegg, I spent the whole afternoon yesterday trying to find the option for Bitcoin payment. 
I made sure the product was sold and shipped by Newegg, and I even used a VPN to see if it was restricted to USA. Nothing worked.

That has got to be the biggest stock of Salsa Valentina I've seen in a shelf.

UPDATE: Upon further investigation, it appears this was indeed the work of a Customs Agency (or customs broker) working with DHL in Mexico.
There's no message indicating the package was opened or inspected, but there's this clear tape with a website address covering a cut on the DHL envelope.
After some googling, it turns out this customs agency has many complaints from DHL packages of all kinds of stuff that arrived opened. 
So if by any chance a Trezor employee sees this, it may be good to take notice of this situation for further shipments to Mexico using DHL.

It looks like he had one too many marijuanas...

I feel like an idiot, but you're right. I was blinded by rage for a few minutes. I'll try to contact them.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:20:04
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Mine went through two customs, so it's quite possible.
Anyway, I'm contacting Trezor support right now. 
Did you end up using yours?

Thanks a lot for the link!. 
I posted an update. It looks like it was indeed a customs broker/agency working with DHL in Mexico. There's many complaints online for all kinds of packages being opened before delivery.

Now someone make a collage with Christian Bale pictures, so we can visualize previous years too.
