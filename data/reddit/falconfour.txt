Today I tried making my first purchase with Bitcoin in quite some time. I was taken to Bitpay of course. Calculated out that I'd be paying $10 more than paying cash, but you know, whatever, it was kinda worth it.
But then stopped cold by this Payment Protocol URL bullshit, as if it was the only thing to have ever existed. I had 15 minutes to figure out what the fuck a Payment Protocol URL was. It certainly wasn't an address. Coinbase wallet didn't understand it as a QR code recipient, nor as a paste-in "send to" address. Nothing understood it. Browser crapped out an "unknown URL" error.
What a disaster. With only 5 minutes to spare, I abandoned Bitpay and just paid with PayPal instead. Now some 4 hours later, browsing around out of frustration (and indeed finding some articles saying that Wowowow Coinbase now supports Payment Protocol ... but the instructions no longer work, and it seems to have been removed), I come across this little tool that I'd need to download and run (thankfully already having Python installed) to get it to work...
Not a good sign of Bitcoin's feasibility.

I'm rocking two BFL Single SCs right this moment, picked up on Craigslist for $10 each last night, cranking out 120GH/s and sucking 680 watts out of the wall with a 650-watt HEC power supply.
About 24 hours running, 0.00075514 BTC, or almost 20 cents! Woot! ... on 10 kWh (literally 9.99 as I write this) of electricity, or $1.97.
Also, constantly running a fan with the window open to keep my room cool, and sleeping with the sound of a jet engine roaring right next to my head, and I think that unbelievably-beefy power supply is about to become molten lava.

Closed mine as well. I'll just trade with cash in person if need be. Quicker than waiting Dwolla's artificially-imposed funds transfer delays anyway.
