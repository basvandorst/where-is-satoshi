If only the USD was held to the same standard as Bitcoin.

All arguments against Bitcoin from the clergy of the current financial system boil down to, "trust us."

You could certainly be right.  We may be heading towards a proprietary dystopia of self-driving cars that own us, rather than the other way around.
In a way it's like the financial system.  We currently have a closed system run by elites that cannot be audited.  Bitcoin provides an alternative to which we can transfer our social trust.
It really seems we're going the other way with cars, which makes me sad.  If we're going to transfer the risk of driving to a computer, I want the code to be public.  Moreover, I want the ability to modify it.

Well then I guess that settles it!

It depends.  If a self-driving car is running proprietary, closed-source code DRM'ed by the manufacturer, then we're worse off than before.
Now a car that runs free software that you can 3D print some of the part for, now we're talking.

I think this will be one of the defining characteristics of the 21st century.
Great article.

A true inspiration.  Congratulations and thank you!

"People should not be afraid of their cancers.  Cancers should be afraid of their people."
There is no such thing as good government.  Only corrupt individuals who seek to control others.

You're probably right, but if the income tax was repealed today, the federal government would only return to the level of funding it enjoyed during the Clinton years.

The corporate-government state is real.
We need to abolish the income tax.  Now.
