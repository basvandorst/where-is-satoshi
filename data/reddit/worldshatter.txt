Well the first thing most people point out is the fact that you aren't charged the absurd transaction fees that come with things like paypal, this means that he gets to keep about 4% more of the money sent to him, in addition the risk of fraud is substantially reduced to to the elimination of the risk of chargebacks.

I can see your point there, I suppose a better way to put it would be people of my mindset would bail in that circumstance.

They don't give a damn about consumers, the only thing they care about it the fact that they can't control cryptocurrencies. Hits them right in the megalomania.

What?!?! Banning things always works.. I mean.. look at how successful prohibition was.

That would probably be more effective for now, keep it in a safe deposit box and have it given out when you die.

I'm not buying anything advertised as "for Bitcoin" unless they put their money where there mouth is and start accepting it.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:20:38
Most altcoins value are directly tied into exchanging them for Bitcoin, with the price dip that resulted due to Mt.Gox the altcoins were dragged with it.

Well when you think about it with any currency the vast majority of it is going to be held by a small group of people, it's pretty cool that to get started with the concept you don''t really have to invest much beyond a few of your fiat currency here and there.

Dude, I want you to think this through really carefully... if you do this your kid is going to wake up tomorrow morning with no dad, yeah, his dad made a bad financial decision... so what? You can still find a way through all of this, there are helplines that can talk to and guide you far better than I can, just don't do it

I've heard people talk about this before, one of the main problems that comes up is the possibility of finding some way to vote multiple times, the only real way around this would be some form of transaction verification by assigning each person one address and only allowing them to send one transaction to the respective candidates address during each vote. Votes could be distributed from a central beuro or by an algorithm with one vote being sent to each address and a client being used to confirm your choice, after which your vote is sent to that candidates address.. the candidate who has the most votes sent to them wins.

Andreas Antonopoulos, because he's done so much for promoting/explaining Bitcoin

I don't have much experience in that particular field but I believe there are services that can supply you with immediate fiat conversion removing the volatility risk. Your prices might fluctuate from a number standpoint but they'll stay the same in fiat value.

Regulation that allows for certain coins to be blacklisted, that would completely destroy the entire ecosystem however any government enforced regulation whatsoever would probably cause me to bail.

Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto never really existed and we just created him and this technology through the power of imagination.

You know.. I once heard someone say that they had just heard of a book called How to kill a mockingjay ... I died a little on the inside.

Satoshi chose to remain anonymous probably mostly due to what happened to the creators of previous virtual currencies like e-gold .. also the possibility exists that he just doesn't want all the attention that comes with being an e-celebrity. I'm going to respect that

Well to answer the title no, greed is very good for any currency because it gives people an incentive to protect it and increase it's legitimecy/security. What you seem to be referring to is the problem of many people hoarding bitcoin for a long time which could be considered a pretty big problem, the main way to counteract this of course is to give them reason to part with their Bitcoin, as it becomes more widely accepted more and more people are going to be able to live off of Bitcoin giving them incentive to spend it, things such as discounts and promotions also act as incentives for people to part with their Bitcoin.

And provided of course that people keep their address' hidden it can still remain a private balot.

It is possible, but so absurdly unlikely it can be nearly totally disregarded, you are essentially guessing at one series of characters amongst an incomprehensible number of others... the way I see it... if you are that absurdly lucky that you can spit in the face of probability... go ahead and take the 5 satoshi's that are contained within that wallet.

She did an absurdly stupid and irresponsible thing and abused her position as a journalist... however I see no reason why people intend to harass her to this level, I think she should have to pay some penalty for her actions but nobody deserves to be witch hunted in this manner.

I've heard stories of people doing stuff like that.. implementation is a bit more finicky as the rules aren't as clear as they are with fiat currency but it is pretty cool, almost reminds me of the practice of buying stocks for people.

I would actually consider it a negative to have bank backing on Bitcoin, the whole intention (for me at least) is to move away from centralization and the corruption that comes with it so that you can give power back to the users.

What?... I was too busy drinking this kool aid to notice what you were saying..

I'm going to be cynical here and asks what evidence there is that you won't just take the money and run?

There's no such thing as bad press, the way I first head of Bitcoin was as a result of someone mocking it.

Based off of my experience with the WoW forums it's a terrible idea to post ANYTHING there.. you did manage to get one guy in on it though (even if you did have to send him 0.8 BTC)

I wouldn't consider it impossible considering the recent revelations regarding the NSA infilitrating Subreddits.

I think it's an interesting concept that could be explored in an altcoin first.. don't know if it would be implementable for Bitcoin though

It's good to see more people coming around to making proper backups/cold storage of their money, you wouldn't be so careless with physical money, why do it with digital money, also yeah... make a few paper wallet backups as well if you can and keep them in different safes/deposit boxes.
