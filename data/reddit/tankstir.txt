I am waiting for Steam! I use them more than all the others.

This really freaked me out. I went and called my bank right away to check.

Thank you. I will check and see if I can do this with my vpn. It is a pre-configured one on my router.

I wish that this could happen too. The problem is easy come, easy go. If you gain it too quickly you will be more likely to spend it all. I'm all for giving it away if you "win big" but I am really interested in the creation of wealth. If you gain more, you can give more. The problem is you may lose sight of the giving part and focus on the getting. Also, rich people stay rich by not spending their money...

You are so right. I enjoyed reading that, thanks! I just hope that the [influence on XT is the right thing. From reading about the Streisand effect it could actually do this.

It's all "bitcoin" to me.

"harms anybody" can be very broad unless you narrow down what you mean.
