No, this is how you annoy female Bitcoin enthusiasts and make Bitcoin users in general look like 13-year old neckbeards.
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:18:21
Ah, so we're actually discussing instead of just insulting now! Awesome.
You're trying to insinuate that I have some problem with the booth girls themselves. Not at all! I think porn actors, prostitutes, models, booth girls, etc, all deserve just as much respect as the next person. 
There's a huge difference between criticizing the people performing these jobs and criticizing the people who think "Hmm, how am I going to advertise something? Oh, I know, I'll slap my logo on a pair of boobs". 
I have zero problem with the booth girls (or other "paid to be attractive" jobs) themselves. If anything it'd be nice if they could be treated with more respect by the marketing industry. 
If you'd like, maybe you could read what I've said instead of just attacking what you *assume* to be my opinion? It's much more interesting to talk to an actual person instead of a straw (wo)man, I promise you.


Oooh, guess we're not done trying to insult me. Grow up pal.
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:51:54
The sex appeal is usually not there, no. It's also targeting men specifically, not women.

You're welcome!
@_date: 2014-05-10 06:47:07
That's funny, considering you just spent more than 5 posts getting angry.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:43:13


It sure is!


You sound mad.
I'm just saying, celebrating stupid pictures like this doesn't impress people. There's wearing a shirt with a logo on it to spread awareness, and then there's this.
@_date: 2014-05-10 05:56:55
Hm...could it be that trying to appeal to one gender only for a gender-neutral clause might not please the excluded gender? That might be what's different from a dude spinning a sign.
I get the impression you're implying I have some problem with the women modeling themselves? I don't, and I wish people would stop acting like I've said that. There's nothing wrong with the models/booth babes etc themselves, just in the idea of only bothering to advertise to one gender.
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:58:12


Except you did just that...but okay. 


I find it kind of funny that you're asking me this after spending several posts insulting me for no reason. 
Moving on, [here]( is one (highly upvoted) example of someone feeling insulted by these tactics.
As far as being insulting to women: this kind of advertising says "we just want to appeal to men. We don't want to appeal to women". How is it *not* insulting to be completely ignored as a group, for a topic which shouldn't be gender based at all?
There was a thread a long time ago in this subreddit where someone posted a picture of their Bitcoin enthusiast meetup, and most of the people in the picture were women. Everyone was shocked that so many women were interested, and people asked OP how he managed to get women interested in Bitcoin. The answer is you bother mentioning it to them and advertising it to them just like anyone else, instead of insulting us by only bothering to try to get men interested in it.
It's insulting that a *gender-neutral movement* is inclined to do without an entire gender.
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:17:39
Someone's a little upset!
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:24:17
Er...did you read my response? At all? I literally said that the advertising is just appealing to men. That's it.
Why are you making weird and completely wrong assumptions about how I feel about women showing their bodies etc? **Once again**, I don't have any problem with that. All I'm doing is pointing out that booth babes only appeal to one gender.
Please read my post before replying...
@_date: 2014-05-10 01:31:08
(I like how those are cards instead of legitimate issues, but that's beside the point)
As someone else has said, it makes it look like the advertiser doesn't think highly of you when they just use breasts to grab your attention rather, than, say, some kind of tagline about what's cool about Bitcoin?
What kind of message does that send about Bitcoin users? To Bitcoin users?

Right, they're totally doing it for the benefit of women. It's just another thing that is meant to appeal to *men*.


All I said was that it was insulting and annoying, and *you* get upset, angry, and insult me for several posts. Take a look in the mirror eh?
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:27:11
I don't have any problem with advertising using attractiveness, etc, the problem is that it's only *bothering* to appeal to one gender. It's tantamount to saying "Bitcoin rules, only men need apply". 
Yes, using male models would be better. Sure, might still make the community look a little pathetic, but at least then you're not excluding half your potential audience.
@_date: 2014-05-10 06:38:04
Oh my god you're hilarious! :'D
@_date: 2014-05-10 05:06:51
Cool, but there's a 50+ upvoted top comment that disagrees with you.
Just saying, no one person speaks for their entire gender. Some men find it insulting to be appealed to like they're fourteen, some don't.
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:14:01


Actually, if you read what I said instead of just getting pissy and coming up with your own interpretation, I said it was annoying and made Bitcoin users look like teenagers.
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:27:27
Where have I said anyone was exploited? I don't think it's exploitation at all. For the last time, **stop putting words in my mouth.**
**If you have to put words in someone's mouth to form an argument against them, maybe your position isn't as strong as you'd like it to be**.
I said it's *insulting*, not *exploitative*. You don't find it insulting? Okay, but other people do.
@_date: 2014-05-10 05:54:52


Like...you? Just saying.
Is it so hard to understand that maybe something is legitimately insulting, or that people are legitimately insulted by something, and that just because *you* don't understand it due to *your* life experiences/perspective doesn't mean that there's something terrible about the people who have a different opinion than you?
What amazes me is there's always someone like you who manages to feel that *they*, the included party, is the victim--rather than the group that's excluded. It must be really tough, occasionally having to scroll past someone saying they're not a fan of, shocker, **something that was designed to appeal to everyone but them**.

Why do you assume I'm mad? I'm simply pointing out a fact. Booth babes only appeal to men and they can make the community look bad.


If you're specifically targeting your advertisements towards men only, yeah, not many women are going to get interested. 


Of course! Totally understandable. Except the community doesn't want to bother including women at all.
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:40:41
:\ I understand that you're not trying to attack me, and I appreciate that, but once again you're not actually reading what I've said. It's very frustrating. But I do appreciate that you're not doing it on purpose. 


...and why is that?


This is what I mean by not reading what I've said...I said specifically that *booth babes* only appeal to men. (Of course I'm talking about hetero men, but that's obvious). Booth babes are sex appeal directed towards men. They're specifically targeting men, not women.
 &gt; People are capable of being adults when it comes to sex, and maybe we should be giving them the chance to behave that way :)
I don't see what that has to do with anything?
Are you assuming that I'm some prude who is upset that women are flaunting their breasts or something? I'm getting so exhausted with everyone here assuming that. Women can dress as skimpy as they want or don't want. So can men. Booth babes, porn stars, prostitutes, Hooters girls, etc, none of that is the issue. These people deserve more respect than they get and people are welcome to flaunt what they've got.
The *issue*, once again, is when you're only *bothering* to appeal to men and ignoring women entirely. That sends the message that women aren't welcome in the Bitcoin community.
Again, I'm not trying to be rude, and I appreciate that you're not trying to insult me (I've certainly had enough people insult me over this opinion in the last few hours, real mature), but please actually read what I'm saying!
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:52:23
Well you sure told me
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:01:26
On that note, should we explore why you feel the need to follow me around insulting me instead of actually discussing what we disagree on?
If you'd like to actually discuss the matter, I'm game. Men have a difficult time understanding the problem, but it's insulting to women in general when women are just used as advertising instead of actually treated like people.
@_date: 2014-05-10 06:37:42
Wrong! Nowhere have I complained that the *women* are choosing to use their bodies that way. I'm simply irritated that the "advertising" is only attempting to appeal to men, and is ignoring women entirely.
You could maybe read what you're responding to....?
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:23:04


Holy shit, do you actually think this is true? That's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard.


Wrong. Shitty boy's club community (you being an amazing example, so thank you) isn't going to win any hearts, but women are Bitcoin users too.

Agreed. As a woman I just feel insulted whenever a company tries this crap, just as I imagine it insults the intelligence of the men it's marketing to.
@_date: 2014-05-10 02:20:26
My bad, didn't realize you speak for all men! A significant portion disagree with you though.


This type of marketing is an instant turn-off for me. I'd like to be taken seriously by a company which is trying to sell me stuff. By appealing to such primal instincts they just seem really unprofessional to me. I can't shake the impression of dealing with something cheap or crappy.

Nothing is wrong whatsoever with her wearing the outfit! I've said this repeatedly and it would be really cool if people would stop just assuming I have some problem with her or the outfit.
All I did was point out that this form of advertising only appeals to one gender, and can make the community look like a bunch of neckbeards.
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:27:48
Err...no that wasn't what I was saying. What I was saying is that it advertises only to men and excludes women.
@_date: 2014-05-10 01:04:07
Sure, revert to insults when it's pointed out you're not actually responding to my argument.
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:22:11


There's more than one problem with this. Finding more than one issue with something isn't backpedaling :P And it's certainly not "a lot".


No, that actually isn't what I meant to say! What I meant to say was...brace yourself: what I wrote! **This kind of thing can annoy women and make the community look like a bunch of neckbeards**. That's it, that's the statement. And then the statements you quoted, I meant precisely what I stated there, too. **The reason it can annoy women is it makes some of us feel like the advertiser thinks little of us. It excludes us and doesn't bother advertising to us**. 
These are pretty straightforward statements and frankly I think you're giving people way too much credit. Nothing there is hostile to the model, nothing there even accuses the community of sexism. Nothing even says the advertiser *should* do differently, or that it would benefit the advertiser to do differently! Nope. It's all right there. I get it, I'm a woman, we're confused muddled hysterical creatures who don't know what we're saying, but I promise you, I thought about those words when I typed them. There's no excuse--**no excuse**--for people getting pissy over what they **assumed** was my opinion. I was very clear.


And men can only be advertised to using the sports channel amirite? Because all men love sports! Yay stereotypes!
Frankly the idea that to not exclude women, you'd have to advertise on a fashion show (I'm guessing that was a very lame joke) is missing the point entirely. **The people who are there around the booth babes are *already interested* in that kind of thing. Example: Video game convention! Shocker, all the women there are into video games!** A booth babe, while probably effective at quickly grabbing attention, nevertheless also pushes away many women and many men.
^^^^ That's it, that's the point I'm trying to make. Just that *it pushes some people away*. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:08:27


The funny thing is, I've never once said "such and such shouldn't be done". Just having it pointed out that what appeals to some won't appeal to everyone is enough to really anger some people. ;P


Meh...the upvotes are on my side, frankly, not that it matters. Some people agree with me, some don't.


Yup! I totally agree with your point and you're right, it didn't really have anything to do with mine. I really don't have a problem with "women flaunting themselves" etc. People can express themselves--or pretend to express themselves for money--however they please! It's really none of my business, or anyone's business, and even if it was, nothing wrong with it. 
Thank you, though, for at least listening to me telling you that's not what I meant! For being Scandinavian you sure have better reading comprehension than 95% of the other people who have responded to me. :P

Personally I think I prefer it if people don't dump BTC whenever they think it's going down. Too many people are acting like stock investors with the currency and it's adding to the volatility. 
Holding on to existing BTC and buying a little more *if* it does get that low is a valid tactic. 
Not everyone is looking for the same thing from BTC, and not everyone wants to suck all the fiat currency out of it they can get (at the cost of more stability).
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:34:17

The author is just pointing to another chart of things rising quickly as his evidence that this isn't a bubble. Don't get me wrong--I don't think it's a bubble--but most of these if not all of these technologies started out expensive and got cheaper, not the other way around.

Who said anything about owing an invitation or a lecture? The question was asked, how do you involve women, and the answer is the same as anyone. If you don't want to involve women, then don't worry about it. 
No need to get so upset. But it's clear you have a bad attitude about women. Don't want to get called out for having a bad attitude, don't have one and then get pissy and whine about it. Man up,.as they like to say.
