And there's the reason the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" was used. "He" wanted people to focus on the message and not the face behind it. Think about Wikileaks/Julian Assange and the NSA/Edward Snowden. Slander the face to suppress the message.

14% increase in a year? Check the price of LTC at the beginning of 2017. ~$4.33.
Current price is about $92-93. That's a liiiiiiiittle bit more than a 14% increase! Faster transaction times, larger coin supply, and atomic swaps/lightning network.

Gemini. You can ACH $500 per day and they'll let you trade with the BTC/ETH you buy right away. You just can't withdraw it until your funds clear.

Matzi? It's moxxie!

Do LTC. You won't regret it. Set a reminder for next year at this time but it will NOT be under $100.

yeah I woke up to an alert at below $4000, bought my first $100 worth from Coinbase and now wishing I had just waited a bit to see what all of this non-sense was going to turn into. I was just hoping to catch it below $4000 so that's what mattered to me. I didn't expect to go to sleep and wake up to it going from $3975 to 3750 but hey, that's the market!
All of this is just so fun though!

That's the first misconception. You don't have to purchase a whole one. Do you have $100 of fun money to throw around/gamble? By in with that little BIT of money for some bits.

I've had my main reddit account for like....7-8 years now and I went through my inbox trying to see if I had a bitcoin tip at any point.
It ended up being a very insignificant amount of Dogecoin haha.

Personally, I'm only investing in BTC/LTC/ETH/XRP. Those are the 4 that I see the biggest potential with.

Yeah that's what I'm thinking. I'm in it to HODL, not day-trading. This is all just very interesting and exciting to me, as lame or cliche as that may sound lol.

because of the fork coming up?

Since when did 30 years old become "just a kid"?

Satochis? You might want to ask for a refund.

But that's the thing, you had no idea it was going to jump up. At some point someone laughed at the idea of bitcoin being worth $1, let alone $1000-5000, right? lol

I ignored it for so long and just brushed it off. Jamie Dimon's comments were what made me pay attention a month ago. I couldn't buy a whole one at the $3k dip that he caused but I ended up getting it around ~$4k and then other pieces at around $3600-3800.

It would be nice if you could use bitcoin without having to worry about the ridiculous taxes that take place during transactions.
