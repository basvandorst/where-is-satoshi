1 dollar equals 10.56 bolivar 
That’s the official forex price though. 
In real life, you get something like 400 to a dollar on the street

I think you mean 5:1

I think “Worst Case Ontario” just became my band’s name.

I think if we’ve come this far we will be able to cross that bridge when/if we come to it.

That being banned from other industry left us few alternatives than the financial services sector

Yes. And from what I’ve seen on testnets, it’s been making substantial progress. It takes time to develop a new technology.

It is always possible to add more decimal points at later dates if necessary

This is a really interesting allegory. I’m still trying to decide if I agree or not though.

YouTube is owned by google and gets massive advertising revenue. They probably can’t and don’t have humans look at each one that is paid for and posted. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:05:28
And it is possible to implement more decimals if the community comes to a consensus that it is necessary or desirable.

The goal is a noble ideal. In practice, it enslaves those it does not kill.

I don't think LTC is a fork exactly, it's just its own thing entirely. It does largely share the same code as bitcoin, but with some key differences.

As a bitcoin supporter, I'd still have a hard time believing 800% gains in a year does not look like a get rich quick situation.

You forget about the cost of transaction, including any fee you pay acquiring and sending. You have no additional conversion cost transacting in USD to USD.

Considering that there are many cryptocurrencies out there, I think it might actually be more like buying stock in the first publicly traded company on the internet. Bitcoin uses block chain technology, but it's possible it won't always be "THE block chain".  It's possible it's like holding stock in AOL.
