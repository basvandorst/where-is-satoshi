It clearly states on c-lightning's GitHub page not to use real funds in the implementation. Then, on the LightningCharge page it boasts main net transactions. LightningCharge is built on top of c-lightning- so why the conflicting sentiments.

Yeah but there's still the issues of no easy to operate mainnet wallet, security issues, bugs, etc. Exciting, but I don't see adoption happening over night

Any reviews of this service? Can I use it in MD?

What makes you say it's only running at half capacity? The lack of segwit adoption?

shouldn't have to, the legacy formats will still be there.

Not sure what you're asking... it sells at the market price.
IF you're wondering what you would do for taxes... most people do first in first out, so if you bought .01, then .09, and sold the .01, you'd be selling the first buy...

Seems unlikely. Unless he is transferring from some 1000+ address, which I guess is possible bc they are from mining.  .04 fees should place it on the next block, but check to see how many input addresses there are via a block explorer

Good choice!

You're sending from an address with a higher balance then the amount you are trying to send. 
It will send the entire balance in the transaction - allocate the amount you are sending. Then send the rest back to you at a different address as 'change'. Your wallet will manage everything for you.

Recently I bought a watch using bitcoin and bitpay. I accidentally sent too much and your service alerted me of an overpay. I emailed the vendor, but they did not refund my amount, or even get back to me, I tend to think the contact the company used to set up bitpay was no longer active. 
Needless to say, I am now hesitant to pay for things with bitcoin nowadays. Is there anyway that bitpay can work to strong arm refunds on overpays and other simple mistakes that bitcoin newbs could make when starting to use the technology?

thats a lot of XMR you're requesting- maybe they're still working on getting enough to fulfill your transaction. IMO it might have been a goofy idea for you to make such a large transaction in one swoop.

Sort of sucks that bitcoin users have to pay fees, while apps like venmo sends money for free.
I love bitcoin, just think the fees thing is a major snag in global appeal.

don't listen to this guy.

From what I understand, you have nothing to worry about. It's always a decent idea to get your coins off an exchange ( if you understand what you're doing. ) But I don't believe any harm will come to them in an exchange as a result of BIP91

Stock market? You mean out of an exchange?
