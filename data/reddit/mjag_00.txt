That's not true. There are more than one right wing parties in Venezuela, e.g., Primero Justicia, Voluntad Popular, AD, Alianza Bravo Pueblo, etc. They  just formed a coalition (MUD) to remove the current leftist government, not very effectively, I must say. When election times come, they all go back to being separated.

That's not true. Very very very few people in Venezuela knows about Bitcoin or cryptos. The only few that know about it are young techies and business oriented people that joined early this year to ride the bullish wave. In a country where minimum wage is less than $20 equivalent, no access to USD or foreign currency accounts,  and more than 80% of population are in poverty conditions, how do you think they would be able to afford a mining rig or buy bitcoin?

There are no sanctions against the Venezuelan people! Are you a bot or what?? Only the president and a few other top officials  
Haha The banks actually don’t want to lend money to Venezuela’s GOVERNMENT. They are on the verge of defaulting. Would you lend money to someone who burnt trillions of dollars in the past decade and is now on the verge of bankruptcy??
The problem is Venezuelan Government is a Narco-State.  
I’m Venezuelan. I’ve seen first hand how Chavez and now Maduro have destroyed the country through the years. Your communist propaganda won’t work on me.

Would you mind listing the sanctions?

There might be some people doing that. But it's not something common, known or near main stream.
The only thing about cryptocurrency going on in Venezuela, which just boomed early this year, is mining as a mean of income, just because cost of electricity is negligible. Still only a very small percentage can afford a rig. There is no buying or selling in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in Venezuela. Perhaps there is but only in underground markets amongst techies.

The reason is institutionalized corruption.

Anti-US propaganda repeated by Venezuela's government and its commie friends.

Yes, it helps. It's some sort of justice for the people of Venezuela. it helps so those criminals won't get to enjoy the billions of dollars they stole, in peace at least... They will eventually end up in jail, you know that. In today's world you can't hide or avoid justice forever.

You’re either very misinformed or you are one of those who sold their souls for US dollars  to support those criminals, at the expense of the lives of the people of Venezuela. 
Sanctions were put upon individuals, government officials involved in crimes against humanity, drug trafficking, corruption, etc.  The government of Venezuela is free to buy all the food, medicines, and basic living stuff they need, they are just very short on cash, and the little cash they have they are using to barely pay foreign debt to avoid defaulting, and to try to support their failed government by paying whoever they need to pay to get support. If there is anything left after that, they will put it in their pockets. Before the oil price debacle they were doing the same, only in reverse order, money in their pocket first, and then the rest. The difference is that back then with the oil price above $100 there was always plenty of cash left to burn.

Add Idiocracy,  institutionalized corruption, narco-state, destruction of the domestic industries, no social security... I can go on forever.

You can't legally get, make transactions  or have accounts in foreign currency  in Venezuela. You can get dollars cash in the black market but what to do with it. 
If he charges his clients in Bs, then he can't convert them to U.S. Dollars (legally), and saving in Bs. is not a good business with an anual inflation rate of 2000%. If he charges in U.S. dollars in cash, then he can't deposit it in any bank or transfer it to a account abroad.
A workaround is to get paid in gifts cards in USD and find a way to transfer their value to services like PayPal as savings, or to be able to use the money online.
I hope this helps.

I registered just last week and got validated within 20 minutes after sending all documents. No problem so far but this truly worries me.
