Oh wow! They’re completely messing up the good thing they had, they will even introduce SEPA withdrawal fees. I guess the new owners wanna pay back their investment really fast. All in all, Bitstamp, you officially suck.

I second this one! Bitstamp is definitely the best one in my opinion to enter the world of crypto. They have low fees and reliable service.

Hahhahaha...poor Elmo...Well, that's crypto life! Happy crypto life, pissed crypto wife! :D

The chaos has begun!
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:00:21
Why are people fighting over this? Are you all holding either BTC or BCH? I'm really interested to see how many of you are holding both and still fighting!
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:56:50
In the beginning there was only Bitcoin. Now, the odds have turned. And they will keep turning. Bitcoin will for sure remain the most valued one, but many more are coming and eating away on Bitcoins marketcap. At the same time, with the growing crypto market cap, Bitcoin will not remain the top investment choice anymore.

In the end, it doesn't even matter... It's not like there can be only one! We will rock the world with the new paradigm!
Go crypto! :D

Yeah, serious. They earned too much money to just shut down the business.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:16:39
Hah! That's amazing. Instead of being an easy method of paying, it turns out to be a more complicated one!
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:50:29
The statement: "It's a serious market!"... Really... That guy has to be used to not-serious markets having 300+ billion US. I wonder, how many are there?

Why would western union go belly up? They'll figure out a solution for sure. Behemoths do not fall apart just like that.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:01:39
It shall prevail!
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:24:26
Well, I wouldn't call it self destructive, but pointless. Bitcoin will always (or at least for a longer time) have a special role in this world, but it will be overpowered by many new projects coming up. Crypto is changing the business, that's the point!
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:58:56
But a temporary Tip...Bitcoin will be tipping us much higher :D
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:57:55
Does it even matter? It's your investment choice, you hope it'll go much higher so you can make more money. So, predictions can be only used for newbies entering the crypto world and buying at insane prices. If you're here for a longer time, you shouldn't even care. It's not a short-term game.

Competition does not mean that they'll disappear. Does inventing other more advanced cryptocurrencies mean Bitcoin will die out?
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:01:21
Why only Bitcoin? There are a lot of really nice projects and cryptos out there. I have done the same thing, but I have diversified across 6-7 cryptos. For the past two months that has been working really nicely.
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:59:42
Well, rat poison fights back :D
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:17:36
Never let them go. That's your road to a nasty addiction and path to riches.
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:01:09
I laughed a bit.
