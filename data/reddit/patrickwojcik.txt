Agree... especially cause more and more people are joining the innovation. Even the folks who are not that much educated are trying to get into the whole thing. The government should be worried when the poor get back up.
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:34:25
I have this weird feeling... maybe I'm wrong but feels a little epic-ish, huh?
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:35:32
It's a good idea, more has to be done to make crypto a daily routine and not just a technology geek stuff.
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:29:18
It's good to see that they are expanding the crypto payments, but has anyone tried it yet?
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:27:54
Haha nice, I think all these crypto moves lately are driving the US government crazy. Seeing the lack of control is hilarious.
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:39:14
I just wonder how they are going to manage that without violating privacy? This is just ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:48:24
With the younger generations, I guess the numbers are going to grow because the whole blockchain story will stop being taboo.
@_date: 2019-08-26 12:54:36
Just go to UniswapDex and do what has to be done!
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:25:20
I am afraid this is only the beginning. Of an end, yes, but still a lot of judicial circles to go.
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:52:48
Let it relax for the weekend huh? x)
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:48:38
Not the only one! Absolutely.
I enjoy discovering new projects within the blockchain too. I stay openminded and dig for what I can find that intrigues me.
The newest finding is Shardus, they even have r/Shardus.
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:46:12
Nope, that's November.
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:20:48
Only if they proceed to develop it. Inter-shard communication is currently not easy and requires the development of a separate protocol, which could take more time for alts to die, (or resurrect).
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:26:45
I think October is going to be huge. I believe in that prophecy.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:31:22
You better get her some Bitcoin for hers. And I mean the real deal :D
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:47:36
Getting a little back up huh. Maybe sleep till October!
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:55:37
Can't help that, but here's an up for you.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:26:51
Thanks, bro.
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:15:43
I'd get a symbol for sharded node so one day people who find sharding basic normal everyday stuff see an old fart walking with it and be like " man he must have seen some shit".
@_date: 2019-08-22 10:18:39
I'd offer a million in altcoins for that coffee, but he has no way of taking it...
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:30:36
 A reactor can't fail.
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:26:47
BTC is a lady in the late 50s dealing with menopause! &lt;3 but we love it.
@_date: 2019-08-26 12:53:20
October, brother. October!
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:45:09
Damn this is not looking nice. I need some Hopium, or I might just do something crazy
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:33:37
Aww man, can you look into sharding in the future? Is it gonna develop further, I have some hints on investing in some thingys!
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:31:49
Or even both. Or is super jealous. Insane even!!!
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:29:27
Me too. I considered posting but decided it was too much though.
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:51:20
Good. Better spend it on BTC than on a girl, trust me.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:54:06
A really cool wallet, physical one.  Really pricey.
So I can show my grandchildren what we used in the old ages! x)
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:39:42
My cat would always pick cardboard over a Manhattan suite.
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:22:40
I did major journalism, but no, I am not. Something else totally. Why tho?
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:32:30
It's just a hunch I have. Probably from reading into it too much x)  
But also it does make sense.
@_date: 2019-08-09 12:54:46
Inspiring speech.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:37:45
Is it me or is the 4chan prediction coming true?
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:28:15
Keep the savings 50-50 in both and you're covered.
Especially if blockchain develops more in the future, becoming even more stable as an entity and uses sharding to make it faster and more user-oriented.
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:25:21
Yes, please. And also some development of database partitioning becoming more useful, please!!!
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:38:00
Literally, the USA was doing it for the past six decades at least. It's manipulation of the media from Washington.
Not saying I like China's game, but truly accusing someone of something you also do. The oldest trick in the book -.-
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:44:38
How tiny?
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:43:47
Why does it matter? Even if it comes, great! If it comes and overtakes it, it means it's even better, right? Change is sometimes tough to swallow but usually good, especially in tech and industry. Economy is fragile, but it comes around.
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:08:50
Great, now even I got the shivers down the spine.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:37:18
What?? I have to check it out as soon as I move there. Sweet! I wonder what he thinks about UniswapDex.
I love adoption examples. Made my day!
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:00:12
I also think October will be good, but I will try to keep a little more till next year. Thanks everyone for the hopes.
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:48:41
Wish I mine the last one, that would be epic.
@_date: 2019-08-22 10:17:26
Can I pay with altcoins? :D
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:56:51
This is really awful!
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:18:41
Yeah, but it would be good for BTC to keep some altcompetitors, just for the sake of healthy advancing.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:30:02
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:26:03
I think so. But I cannot really confirm. All I know is that miners don't need to mine different shards. In fact, they would be able to form pools with enough resource to mine a big block. But users download and verify only their own shard, this is the whole point of sharding. Seems like a solution for scaling BTC, agree?
