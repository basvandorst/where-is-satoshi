dude, you lost so much.. i work 8 months for such amount in cash.. best choice is to accept it.
@_date: 2012-11-11 14:26:10
we will use bytecoins then!
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:03:53
i wish that was a common sense.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:33:13
that orders can be canceled at any time
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:24:29


do you believe everything they tell you? hint: they dont have a hashing power that huge (if they have any.. my post was kinda a joke..) im in on the boat that says they wont ever deliver, though. i dont know wheres the money.. but judging by how many users paid in BTC, i would say they cashed them out with great profit. refunds are managed partially, but thats not a problem for them.. as they are paying back the USD value (in BTC?), not the original BTC value
@_date: 2013-05-22 11:26:06
makes sense... i just wanted to be sure if i did not find a great profitable hole in the system
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:03:56
i had.. since the last huge crash..the problem is a bought at 110 thinking thats the bottom :/
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:09:35
guys, this is really amazing.. i dont have many bitcoins, but just for the past hour, my profit is 320€, fuck thats how much i make in a month, working! not sitting behind the pc and watching the market. i hope it wont crash soon though, that would make me sad, haha.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:00:50
not really, i just appreciate it that more because i dont have much money in my life :) and i really dont want to lose this. i come from a fairly poor country where 70% of employed people are making minimal wage :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:13:04
the sad thing is that if they offered such option, people would fall for it
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:47:57
these are collectible items in brand new/mint condition, indeed. i would have sold them for less, but with bitcoins you never know for sure.. and i figured for someone that collects nintendo/pokémon items and bought the coins at a low price, this is a pretty good deal.
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:45:18
25 years?
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:28:34
thanks for not teaching me something new i didnt know.. again, i was asking if the import private key function Mt. Gox offers is OK, if anyone actually tried it, so I dont have to use local wallet.
//reading my topic, maybe i did not explain the issue good enough
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:17:56
stop constantly accessing the site, you are not much of a help here
@_date: 2013-04-30 09:27:02
i dont know, dude.. dont know from where OP is, but I am from central europe and make $4k per year.. $20k is a fortune for me.. as for what would i do with 100 BTC, probably wait till they are back on $250-300 per BTC and I would buy my own flat to get out of my parents hair, that would be $20-25k, the rest would go on some basic expenses related to my own flat, or i would leave them in BTC for a while longer, not sure right now.
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:16:48
WTF? are you joking? i thought max. will be three weeks.. im already waiting two weeks. this is not good at all..
//is it a big sum? i put a withdrawal for 1500€, i hope to see them one day, fuck this shit..
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:46:32
people posted about it here in this sub, more than once.. i dont feel like digging those posts out though.. coins appeared on their wallet and they dont know why. and not just bitcents or milicents..
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:42:46
if you will tell me right here right now how a simple european can fund his account quickly/instantly!
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:32:05
1. sell before crash, buy in when it goes down; repeat
2. botnet, tens of thousands of computers attacking at once
2. they work for themselves, taking profit from all of this
4. easy way to make good money
Edit: I have been in contact with the attackers, they say if you want the attacks to stop, the community has to send a collective payment of al least 1378.45607239 BTC to address 1JCNHSYmLxmtPcYG5d4dfSrpkhvGcyU18R, this is their goal and after this they will cease and desist.
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:22:05
yeah, exactly this. i am not sure thats the greatest idea ever, to let children open a business, lol.
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:33:29
probably mined them? as it really was not hard not too long ago.. what does it matter really
@_date: 2013-07-10 12:10:06
since you are so open about your laziness, you would mine 0.2357 BTC per day, break even in about 40 days and make 1500 USD in three months with current exchange rate (dont know the electricity costs though.. i would say less than 100W? so about 30-40 bucks for three months of runtime)
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:05:32
bitstamp too?
@_date: 2013-07-31 14:35:30
waiting for over a month for my 1500€, only 2-3 weeks now, yeah.. btw how much did you pay for the SEPA transfer?

@_date: 2013-04-06 16:40:24
there are trojans that are mining on GPUs of the infected computers, only using certain percentage from their hash power, majority of infected computers wont notice anything, why would someone try to spread this
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:23:56
actually thosand years would be a pretty lucky find, there already is a quantum computer that is 500,000 times faster than its predecessor supercomputer, which was already faster than conventional computers. i will use here math from another comment on this sub "If you have 100 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 * 5850 GPU's, it will still take around 10 000 000 years before you will get the same key twice." so, effectively you would have someones address at your disposal, that is if that address will even contain some coins.
//as for cracking private key directly from known address, i am not sure if that is even mathematically possible
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:09:04
i see you like to live dangerously
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:47:54
Oh, sure.. that was that "immense undervaluation" you were talking about.. whooping 0.002 difference. either you dont know the meaning of those words or are just trying to save the situation rather pathetically.. its that hard to admit a mistake? granted its a solid one, but.. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:06:37
fuck, its hard not to invest when the profit i have now from 10BTC bought at 47 equals to my monthly salary. im scared things will go downfall as quickly as they rised though..
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:26:42
people, spread the word everywhere, or just upvote this, the power is in our hands, more than 30k users are subscribed and can see this, we have to bash Mt.Gox, they need to understand that they overstepped. they want a short term profit rather than a long happy run? lets show them we can buy coins elsewhere!
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:14:15
wow, nice to know.. last time i waited more than a month. i put a witdrawal of the exact same amount three days ago, gonna check it later and report back.

@_date: 2013-04-11 18:53:15
I didn't sell because I believe it will go to at least the price it was before the fall and I can sell them then.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:35:50

k, kiddo.. have fun.

good luck, i hope she sells at least one thing there.. not like that place is overcrowded, we all know why almost every seller goes on ebay, because almost every buyer is already there. also i experienced some bugs putting up things for sale.

@_date: 2013-05-24 07:36:53
AMC shares can be bought only on that one exchange, indeed. they are making it really tough to invest in their company, why? why not offer them also elsewhere, i dont see them as some great success
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:48:36
well from what I understand, its impossible to crack such encryption in reasonable amount of time (like.. less than thousand years) and it wont be possible to achieve it in quicker terms for the longest time. or did you mean, why the hackers wont crack passwords user use within their pools? in that case, i think they do and occasionally they earn something from it. that is why everyone will advise you not to leave your btc in pool for long
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:55:44
because i like their name, they are sound. also from europe, stay strong europe. no america or asia is gonna take our ball!

wish i had 200btc :) i bought just 10BTC at such a low price, the rest during the end of february and march. thanks again, will definitely try them for my next deposit, if there will be any, mtgox is taking too long.. i waited 2-3 weeks and those were sepa deposits.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:04:59
how is that a lose if they sold them at 90 and now buying back at 80?
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:20:00
someone wants to hurt bitcoin
@_date: 2013-07-25 13:48:34
i wonder how that awareness spreading is working out for you though.. like people see the tee and think to themselves "hmm, i wonder what that weird 'B' stands for, guess im gonna try to draw that on my PC when i get home and do a google reverse image search"? or is there somewhere on the back side written "bitcoin"?

yes, lets create two blockchains and see how that works out
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:44:31
i thought you can use HW wallets to actually send/receive coins to others, so it does not act like a cold storage?
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:49:48
yeah, someone cracks your passphrase and that person has access to all your pvtkeys.. paper wallet seems like a better idea imho, if you are storing coins for longer periods of time
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:36:33
cant speak for US buyers, but i heard great things about bitfloor. for EU buyers, i highly suggest bitstamp
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:28:57
not to be a douche or anything, but do you personaly think there is such a promising future for a company that deals with VPS and dedicated servers (BTC exclusive)? serious question, honest answer.. where do you see them in five years? i am asking, because im thinking about investing into something.. i want to try my luck
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:14:43
one hour lag on mtgox? what? people, stop fucking my shit up, dont sell your stash!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:17:46
you know how every single user on this sub was repeatedly saying that no one should invest more than he can afford? i think i was kinda temporarily blinded by this success so far, because i kinda did invest everything, ha.

@_date: 2013-01-21 17:45:16
damn, if they managed to find bitcoin sub on reddit (like thats the most popular bitcoin related place on the internet), they sure can manage to find bitcoin wiki and other helpful sites, they are just too lazy to find solution for their problem! so they ask right away
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:01:35
not to sound like a retard or anything, but.. what is the chance that someones passphrase generated brain address would actually be the same as my normal paper address, so they would have access to it? is this even possible?
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:24:48

my father invested a little over 600 dollars on 102, on that day, the price went up to 115USD and we were kinda happy.. next day.. 90.. next day 80.. etc :) he wants to invest again now when its on 55-60, i keep telling him he should wait until it goes down to 20 :)
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:20:38
sorry, i thought it was obvious from my question.. i have my btc stored in paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:32:57
the price is $80 on bitstamp right now and i am without fiat :) damn... until the mtgox lag is not solved, i think the price on bitstamp can go easily to 50 and i cant buy anything!
@_date: 2013-06-02 16:10:52
its more about privacy than a brand name here.
@_date: 2013-07-07 22:04:22
so.. you would trust this protocol to store all your wealth for you, is that it? should billionairs trust bitcoin with their millions and billions? because last time i checked, bitcoins are not reversible and regulated, that means if i send a million to wrong address, im fucked. if they hack my address, im fucked, because i cant go cry to anyone. if i move a million using bank and something goes wrong, there is practically a 100% chance i can make things right. the fact that you dont have to pay any fees wont impress rich people.
@_date: 2013-07-30 07:47:47
... to make an amount of money i wouldnt/couldnt make otherwise.. just daytrading and investing into stocks gives me a  better yield than my full-time job, which gives me about 500USD per month (im not from US)
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:20:02
thank you very much, the first one.. do I have to be a legal person, or is it possible to buy as natural person? i dont own any kind of business and i am not a US citizen
//also if i want "real shares" (not PT), those can be bought only on bitcointalk, right?
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:16:39
try to reread my comment again, it may help (maybe)
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:57:15
so.. if i use it, bitcoins from my paper wallet will be transfered to wallet Mt. Gox owns, displaying the appropriate amount in my account, or will they stay where they were untill i wont cash them out?
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:31:52
i would like to invest all my bitcoins (little over 40) into shares of one promising company, i would like to bet on it, maybe i will retire after a year, maybe i will lose everything. any serious recommendations where you would feel comfortable putting money into?

mtgox lagging? bitstamp is down, heh
@_date: 2013-02-13 10:37:57
i know admin updated my acc, because he received the payment. that further proves my point that i have sent some amount to my BTC address i got with my BMR account, because how else would he know, i did not contact him in any other way. the address stayed the same the whole time.. why would it change, right? yet no transactions show to or from on the network for that address. the balance in my BMR profile for that address showed 1BTC, now its zero. what more can i tell? there is no way i can check where that 1BTC went from my address (not that i care) and it wont even show on the blockchain from what address I initially received that 1BTC. and here i thought the network is open. that is my question, how its possible to hide transactions on the network? mtgox has similar option in the profile that says you can make transactions appear anonymous, but i never tried it.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:22:56
is money gram only a US thing?
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:16:15
to be fair, they can.. with a 51% attack. no matter how many coins that would create, the point is, you can create "false coins"
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:44:26
even less than 21 mil. people usually dont take into account coins that were lost.. and face it, you read about forgotten passwords, damaged wallets/backups etc every other day

they are close to 3TH i think? i dont know how much one unit makes though

hey! they got a laser printed logo on them! BFL, serious business
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:52:36
yeah, thats what they said at 50 and at 90
@_date: 2013-02-13 09:47:26
also the transaction is not new, so the problem is not there, its like a month old.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:34:02
are you OK?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:43:22
i bet that you shat your pants reading that comment above mine, thinking OP tipped you one BTC. i know i did.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:11:48
i would also sell them for LTC
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:03:15
bitstamp at $90 and is going down.. until gox is back so noobs can buy in? the price will be at 20-30 
@_date: 2013-06-15 07:47:31
thats the next step.. you will put the coin into circulation and when the bitcoin goes properly mainstream, you will announce there is a million moving inside a nickel and the hunt can begin!
@_date: 2013-02-03 19:39:31
im quite sure he dosent have one
@_date: 2013-01-10 19:57:34

@_date: 2013-04-10 14:38:40
people, your comments are scaring me :/ i am on the verge of cashing out a portion that would give back my initial investment, but that would be giving up on ten bitcoins and i dont have many left from there, aaah.. what to do what to do, im conflicted
@_date: 2013-07-24 22:47:14
so thats why stocks are going down
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:29:46
i like to be thorough
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:08:05
to be completely fair, i just want to make some extra money and this seems easy and feasible enough. i am in my 20s, located in quite a poor country and dont want to spend the rest of my life in my mundane job that gives me just enough money to live from a paycheck to paycheck.
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:00:19
well i never expected it to blow so much, which is really great. holding for now to all of it, but i really considered  cashing out when it hit 49USD. people here kinda persuated me, as majority of the people here think that the price can go up to 100-200USD per coin easily. dramatically? well no.. but it would change my life greatly.. lets just say if i made a 100% profit from my investment, that is like almost a one years salary to me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:32:59
I really dont, I never said i did.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:00:08
so.. apperently Gox is under DDoS attack :) from FB "Maintenance Over however we are now under a DDoS attack."
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:06:39
they already are? asicminer has like 20% hashing power of the whole network now

I see you dont care much about your remaining btc, I have 38.53393463 BTC, care to give me 1.46606537 so i can be on nice round number? lol
also when i am on the subject, i have been trying to sell some stuff for btc, like collectible pc games/consoles/books etc, where can i successfully sell these things for btc, guys? 
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:12:57
this is a long shot, but i do actually hope that those attackers borrowed some huge money with interest to organize these attacks and buy btc when it goes down and that right now they are pretty desperate.
@_date: 2013-03-04 09:12:24
no point doing this or anything else. sending back with tracking? ok, he will just send the coins to his address in the meantime
@_date: 2013-01-25 21:26:04
SEPA transfers are actually without fees.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:38:42
i think its possible even now.. just the people that own that quantum computer are not and wont be doing this. but.. there will come a time for someone.. bitcoin is not the answer to anything.. this sub really feels like a cult.. people predicting the value to be a trillion in twenty years? golly gee, it will be long abandonen or dead by then.

damn.. i never even tried poking around things like stock markets, shares, investing into companies etc.. i dont understand whats going on there on good enough level, haha. just.. not my cup of tea.. nevertheless, i wanted to buy some shares back in august, but it was simply mind boggling for me and i could not figure things out, so i left it at that :/
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:18:59
Mt. Gox will never do this. why should they? they are making money! nicely explained [here](
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:55:55

enthusiasm went off with a significant price drop. how many people should be interested in a currency that they cant even use to pay for things they actually want (if they dont want drugs or electronics) and now that they cant even profit from trading to fiat?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:43:44
dont use fucking mtgox people and you are ok to buy in real time with no lag?
@_date: 2013-07-30 07:52:40
yes, where are all those people that want to change the world by power of bitcoin? we dont need fiat to live, lets buy some alpaca socks with BTC to keep ourselves warm during winter!
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:57:39
lol, how was that an immense undervaluation for 1/100th fractional shares?
@_date: 2013-02-28 16:32:40
it was 32k not long ago, free 7k, nice :)
@_date: 2013-06-09 12:29:54
i dont think he did.
@_date: 2013-07-09 14:33:37
I know one thing.. Ken(owner) stated there are several people on board of his company (obviously), but we dont know anything about them.. not even names.. we dont even know if Ken is a real person.. no assurances, just mega big promises, thats it. the tera hash bitcoin miner that costs 3000 BTC? Ken is acting like he already has them in the thread..  he doesnt even have any of those avalon clones yet.
@_date: 2013-08-02 15:36:58
yes, lets give them out for free
@_date: 2013-02-12 16:54:23
i was thinking of some failsafe, like buyers giving me wallet address via ebay message and the proof would be blockchain, but yeah.. i guess ebay/paypal couldnt care less for this
@_date: 2013-05-24 13:23:22
i think i should generate a few hundred addresses and... wait
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:35:28
why? because its not a skyscraper?
@_date: 2013-05-22 13:30:39
and what if he has?
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:58:42
lol, this time the price goes to 10 bucks, buckle up/cash out, boys
@_date: 2013-06-29 18:59:22
50%? ok.. but there are also other companies that are up 200-300% from the IPO. ASICMINER is up way more from the IPO, im just saying that there are better chances for new investors that want to see some solid profit. look at 100TH for example.. though, i wont lie.. i wanted to buy some AM shares today when they were at 3.4, now.. i dont quite know.. its still a pretty huge amount :D
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:48:40
found them in one small retail store in one small city in the middle of europe, heh
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:42:33
what about paper address from bitaddress.org? is it a safe way to store larger amount of coins?
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:57:42
indeed and the donation amount is "0.00001337" 
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:25:22
yeah, sure there is this chance, i thought about it too. and the only ones that profit greatly are them
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:48:25
lol, whatever.. you are right, they were, but for full shares. those on havelock are 1/100th, i dont know how to explain this any better.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:44:56


lost it right there.
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:50:11
i think i should have sold when it was on 49
@_date: 2013-03-17 18:11:43

someone posted here not long ago top 300 bitcoins addresses and like  60% of them never spent their coins.. the top address had over 111000 coins on it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:58:34
im not saying bitcoins are scam.. its just like on a stock market.. you have to know when to sell.. sadly that was not my case. i was blinded by all these millions and billions in investments, bitcoin ATMs and popularity they were getting worldwide.. all these big businesses and companies acceptings bitcoins.. i think this was my mistake..
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:26:02
it was.. on bitstamp.. lowest i saw was $78 and they were executing orders on that price in real time, fuck.. not a lag. people were buying at selling on that price. now its on $155
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:59:31
that was me, but dont tell anyone
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:10:00
i assume your preorders are still there because they are against refunds though
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:44:33

No, they were not.
I think you may be confused.

ironicaly the only bitcoin related page/exchange that should be up during the planned "mega DDoS action" is now down, haha.
@_date: 2013-07-01 11:34:50
the price of the btc will go only down in the upcomming months.. big fishes are cashing out BTC profits/dividents from stocks, mainly AM stocks. thousands and tens of thousands BTC are sold daily, not enough BTC are bought back, so there is that.. sell, if you are still presently afloat.. wait 2-3 years, if you are already under :D it will get interesting after the next halving and with the difficulty.. bitcoin will be scarce to obtain, extremely hard to mine.. if they will even be used then though. the same thing is happening to bitcoin that has happened with fiat.. few people are holding/controlling the majority of it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:23:51

AMC may as well be a great SCAM.. so beware.. read the thread on bitcointalk.. owner is not answering any legitimate concerns, just making unbelievable promises, so people put more money into it..

they cant show you that, because all the hashing units they use are hashing for their own profit. where every unit there has a laser engraved text with something among the lines "bought with hard earned money of our customers" on top, so... there is that, thats how sadistic they are!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:06:03
lol, really it does not? also, to further clarify, on the long run, i dont count on any other outcomes considering such a "small investment" as i mentioned in my post. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:57:36
yes, used electrum, i am worried now that something happened, as i had some problems with that client
@_date: 2013-07-29 07:31:10
well thats just awesome.. how i hate their interface.. i just received email confirmation about the withdrawal, its more than once and i dont know whats the progress and also cant cancel it
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:36:01
it seems like you never expected such a jump in users, why is it so? did you leave all the unavaidable upgrades on the last possible second? why not to prepare things in advance if you knew long before there will be massive spikes in usage, even people out of the loop predicted this.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:03:16

bitaddress.org is open source, if you want, you can check their code they use.. if they were doing this, i think probably more users would notice something fishy in the code.. is completely client based, nothing is sent to their server. you can generate a new address even if you are not connected to the internet
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:41:10

if they (BFL) offered an option to ship all the ASICs with the current power output they have, i bet 99% of those that preordered would jump immediately for it.

isnt the overclocking dangerous though? you wouldnt want to destroy your precious blade, I imagine. btw is the overclocking managed just by drivers/software, or is it pure HW thing?
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:09:56
well as those BTC would be a gift, I would just wait until they would be of value, if they would go down to 0, so be it.. if we are talking about my BTC that i put my own hard earned money into, i already sold those after the last crash, heh

another question i have, do i need to be verified in order to make larger withdrawals/deposits or its not limited in this way? thanks
@_date: 2013-02-12 18:14:44
both virtual and physical options are available.
@_date: 2013-02-16 12:39:34

i (sadly) predict that too, people (new investors) are gonna cry
@_date: 2013-03-09 19:37:25
yeah, it looks quite lame like this.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:05:10
lol, problems with buying btc? not enough coins, wat? reading your posts here, is it really that hard to buy btc in US? i can buy whatever amount i want instantly after placing order.. i just dont have cash to invest, haha
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:26:46
i would guess that there are different rules for pre-orders and orders for physical things that are ready to be shipped. you cant pre-order something that does not yet exist, thus is in a stage of development and expect somebody to deliver it within 20 days. does not make sense.
//also i used ebay many times.. if i order things from china for example, they usually arrive within 20-25 **working** days, so how does that apply? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:39:04
so.. what was the point of the server upgrade again? are they just trolling  us? was there even an upgrade?
@_date: 2013-07-12 12:35:28
@_date: 2013-07-01 12:00:20
i dont think that people who invested when it was on 150 and higher share your optimism. good for you to say when you bought in at 50 or lower, lol.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:47:17
I did not, have you by any chance used some special characters in some of the registration form fields? Because I did, then I registered another account without them and after an hour i had the confirmation.. so i reported it as a bug. i had to use a different email and login name, but heck.. at least i put some BTC into my BitFunder.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:27:43
i think its quite late now
@_date: 2013-09-20 09:17:51
Dont worry, there are plenty of preorders for the Monarch paid in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:01:57
i did, but yeah.. fuck it, right? just money.. that you pay your rent with, buy your food with and using for everything essential related to your existance in this world (if you ar enot from a third world country in which case you would never invest into bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:28:57
thats what i am worried about this whole time.. all my coins on one address.. its good to know one day i can lose them just like that..
@_date: 2013-06-02 12:16:22
go public with IPO
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:02:40
i guess thats just my kind of luck too..i had fiat on bitstamp for almost a month, from the time of the last big crash, waited the whole time for a chance that the market would hit 50USD again.. when it crashed to 105 yesterday, i was at work.. bought at 110. now its under 100 and looking as things are, we may actually hit 75 
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:43:12
you have my sword
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:38:53
oh, wow.. thats interesting.. finally some luck went my way too
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:20:10
I thought cryptocurrencies are banned in China?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:08:48
maybe i dont quite understand what you mean. but.. BTC can be fragmented, so.. thats how. the smallest bit is 0.00000001 BTC, also called one satoshi.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:41:29
use paper wallets.. as for two-factor auth., that can be used easily on online exchanges where you can keep your bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:40:04
That will do.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:23:51
dont have funds in exchanges, already bought everything i could.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:45:33
silver down by more than 10% too?
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:35:41
indeed, so if you feel like dedicating 200 bucks to it that you wont need in the near future, buy yourself a coin right now.. you can cash out in five years your 5-10k or you will lose them.. what the heck, right?
@_date: 2013-06-12 20:49:43
probably not a very smart thing
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:31:41
this is amazing, look at how small the btc economy is.. one person can easily crash the market. if i had great amounts of bitcoins, i would just sell them at once, wait for the price to drop and buy my way in again; repeat periodically; ?????; become bill gates.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:39:52
everything is going to shit, i should have sold yesterday when it was at 90USD, i would have at least partially recover my investment, now its on 55USD and going down. withdrawals are closing, orders are closing, fuck this shit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:15:37
i was just thinking about that guy, hopefully when he gets back, he wont even notice from the actual price that the market was at the bottom during his time off.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:19:24
depends.. did that person buy 5,10,20,50 BTC? in that case, yes.
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:36:54
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:24:55
anyone know anything about them wanting to go public with IPO?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:08:56
doh, you shouldnt!
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:23:15
i never understood this.. bitstamp is only EURO and all my deposits are converted from EURO to USD, wtf?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:37:52
aaaaaand next crash is here, that was rather quick. good thing mtgox server upgrade was not absolutely worthless
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:16:24
granted the protocol will even exist in two years.. granted someone will use it again on a global scale, not to just buy drugs.. granted it will be more valuable than 5USD per coin, if all the coins were used just for a certain type of business - mentioned drugs for example.
//and who knows even if onionland will continue to use them, they are trying to find something anonymous, not just pseudoanonymous
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:19:27
i say one satoshi is enough
@_date: 2013-05-18 09:18:40
how can i buy their shares? is it easy?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:34:15


twist: mtgox is its own bitch
@_date: 2013-07-01 19:51:51
and thats why its going down and will continue to do so.. i will probably jump back somewhere around 50-60
@_date: 2013-06-21 18:31:35
lol, u blind nigga


that is exactly what many people said about btc before the crash from 266

@_date: 2013-04-21 12:34:51
yep, its OK now, yesterday i got an 404 page when i pressed the buttom
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:29:20
mine will come in about twelve hours, i think it will be too late for that :/ also its $96 now.
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:16:31
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:39:14
you wont receive anything and if, it will be too late to profit, its time to accept the truth, lol.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:02:40
early miners selling? i dont think so.. if i made 500BTC in two weeks mining on CPU, i would not sell them for sure now or in the near future if there is a great possibility the price will go up tenfold
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:28:36
fucking hell, no kidding i see from todays posts.. i did a SEPA two weeks ago.. good to know i will see my money (maybe) in about a month :D
