No, deversification is key. Start with a small portfolio of a few promising coins then gorw from there!

The name of the exchange I am using (I am trying to avoid getting into debates about what exchange I am using, because most people have extremely strong opinions about the exchanges that are out there and I am trying to avoid all the negative / argumentitive comments).

Depends on the day, somedays I'm only looking at charts for a like 30min or so and othere a few hours, but it is always fun for me so the time I spend is at least not boring.

Sorry I just have it there for monitizeation purposes. I understand it isn't for everyone and I apologize if it scared you off, as that was not my intention.

I'm not spamming its a blog post, with no referral links. Also, the bitconnect email opt-in you are speaking of only shows up one time... If you dont like it close out of it and move on. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:06:39
Thank you for being kind about it. I will keep that in mind. Sorry for not doing my research before hand. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:19:42
No joke! xD
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:10:00
I personally just hope when it tanks it doesn't go lower than 8k
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:02:26
I am selflessly giving. I created educational content and I offer it to others for free. I'm loosing money as of now because I'm not shoving product down peoples throats. Also, I'm not underaged. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:53:14
I am really sorry "check have got to check" was a typo. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:27:25
