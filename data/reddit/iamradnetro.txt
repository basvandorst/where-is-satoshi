@_date: 2013-02-12 00:46:43
aside from mining is there other ways to earn bitcoins(except those ptc/offer websites)
@_date: 2013-07-19 15:32:32
I guess I'll take a look at forex instead, since they are more predictable than bitcoins
@_date: 2013-02-12 01:51:02
ok I'll look into buying a bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-02-12 12:50:01

Liteforex is already accepting bitcoins. But maybe someone could recommend a better broker.
@_date: 2013-02-13 14:45:55
I tried to mine ... and all I earn for like 24 hours is 0.0007... BTC, i tried other sites that pays BTC to click or fill a survey and all I recieve is a spam XD... but I will enjoy bitcoin somehow once I really earn some :)
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:45:36

@_date: 2013-02-12 13:25:00

Ok, I'll bookmark this thread so I can contact you soon. I am really interested to know if they we're built to last for years. Cause I read that some guys is having an issue with their Mining Rig.
@_date: 2013-02-13 15:20:37
It's called Slippage, it happens a lot on stocks and forex. They take advantage this to earn a lot... but there are no news on bitcoins that indicates where things like this happens.
*main cause is the Supply vs Demand
@_date: 2013-08-05 00:46:12
so basically... it is really worth it :) ....hope the lifespan of the rig would really last that long.
@_date: 2013-02-13 15:51:46
If a lot of people start buying ASIC, the price of Bitcoin will drop because of the Supply vs Demand.
@_date: 2013-02-12 13:58:30
since I'm a newbie, I'll use bitcoin client so I can contribute something for the community :) ... but what will happen if my PC got broken? will I ever retrieved the Bitcoin that was save on my PC?
@_date: 2013-02-12 01:14:51
