I need some advice. I was using client 0.8.1 and recently updated to client 0.9.1.0. I updated because as of 28 hours ago by client stopped working which told me to upgrade to the latest version. I am now running the new version but now it still won't sync with the network and its 29 hours behind. It says the last received block was generated 29 hours ago. What am I doing wrong? I am a noob.

I don't mind answering your questions, actually I welcome it. I use voice activated software called Dragon NaturallySpeaking to type. I cannot type in the traditional sense because I do not have the use of my hands. I also can type using a mouth stick but it's slow and tedious. It's like typing with your fingers but one letter at a time. As far as using USB drives and anything hands-on. I've learned to plan ahead and have my caretakers do it for me when they're in my home. I have to give them directions and use layman's terms to describe to them what I need help with because let's face it not everybody is comfortable with computers. I also use a hands-free mouse called SmartNav. Otherwise, I am able to use my computer as freely as anyone else and am able to get to my computer wallet. Like you said, I'm very comfortable with it.
I have been an avid iPhone user but I will make the switch to Android if Apple doesn't adapt to Bitcoin by the time my next cell phone plan upgrade is due. My cell phone is mounted on my wheelchair where I'm able to get to it with the small amount of strength I have in one hand. I don't have any finger dexterity but after my accident I was able to regain a little bit of strength in one arm where I can use touch-screens by grazing by hand.

Yes a Protocol. That is coded and checked behind closed doors. Just like Bitcoin.
VP:Right?

I bought it last week via Amazon ebook kindle edition for $14 to throw A.A some $ for once.
For me as a noob and non programer the first two chapters were  a further understanding of what I've already learned for the last two years. The rest is over my current understanding but nice to have I suppose. Gotta continue the journey.
To be fair A.A did tell us that it was set up that way in latest J.R.E podcast and reinforce in the Preface of Mastering Bitcon.
Intended Audience This book is mostly intended for coders. If you can use a programming language, this book will teach you how cryptographic currencies work, how to use them, and how to develop software that works with them. The first few chapters are also suitable as an in-depth introduction to bitcoin for noncoders — those trying to understand the inner workings of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

For eight dollars I will be getting this as a Christmas present to myself. I like the simplicity of it but I wonder if there is a way I can only get it with the big logo and Bitcoin on the bottom?.
Anyone know of other stores that may sell apparel for other crypto-currencies?

Got mine in the mail
not bad for the price
jumped on it when the price for shipping was two dollars which of course wasn't but was just a few dollars more and if you need a bigger size it will cost you some more too. Just say for those thinking they'll just pay under $10
