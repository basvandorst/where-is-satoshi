From the FAQ:

Twitter is shitty now, there is no video link anymore.
@_date: 2016-04-15 21:03:21
The trace doesn't seem to matter, they are altering the state of the memory permanently.

On Android, maybe it could work with an OTG adapter. I will try once I get my order.
@_date: 2016-04-15 21:06:07
I'm having the same problem, they might have to per-populate or subsidies some merchants.
@_date: 2016-04-15 21:03:54
That's very interesting, I've been in Bitcoin for a long time and never heard of this.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:09:21
I can't wait for more to follow Patrick Byrne's lead. Looking forward to buying some Apple cryptobonds.

I'm a customer and want to thank you again for even more wonderful innovations. I have to agree with Epicenter's podcast, Coinkite is The Feature Factory.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:12:35
Neither, I'm tired of dealing with both of them.
I'm currently using [Coinkite.com API's]( to _watch_ the blockchain and to be the _hot-wallet_ of my app. 
Much more headache free to sign txn that way. On top of it I get a good gui for my CFO to manage the funds without having to know how to code.
edit: for context.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:24:36
I think this is exactly what Coinbase should be doing, now go a step further and put some boots on the ground to do marketing.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:07:35
That pretty cool!
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:17:43
Mattresses 
Now Surgery, why are Australians adopting it so much faster?
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:31:29
Why do you care? It's a technology solution not a legal one.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:31:41
The internet always win, when will main stream learn?
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:38:27
That's fascinating. The amount of news for Australia per small amount of population it's its big.
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:47:48
All the info I could find so far is here  not much about the collocation.
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:12:59
This is great news as just siments that Bitcoin in China is going forward regardless of the FUD
@_date: 2015-05-12 22:18:06
Very interesting, is there any way it can support multi-signature or at least send the funds to a P2SH address?
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:27:05
I  don't know about this one.
But, FIPS is a stupid centralized money grab that ads NOTHING to security. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:58:40
I wouldn't bet my money on that, specially when companies are under NSL.
Why risk it? Specially when there are so many better alternatives with better features and privacy.
Edit: I'd like to add that I don't thin they are bad people or will run away with the money. I quite like what they do, they just chose a path that requires them to conduct business this way. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:30:44
But this is for Coinbase only.
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:07:12
Watch it with an open mind. 
Regardless of your inclination it's important to consider all points of views and it's possible implications. 
I'd appreciate if we keep this discussion about the ideas and not personal attacks like a previous comment in this thread.
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:30:41
If they don't like you (KYC/AML) they can lock you out. This is the antithesis of what Bitcoin is able to provide. If you own the private keys, you own the Bitcoins, on Coinbase you don't. I should also mention that they track and report everything you do (NSL), there is no privacy in their system.
You can still use them to buy, but there are plenty of good alternatives to store. These are secure, fairly easy to use and offer good privacy: For small amounts; Breadwallet or Mycelium, and for anything over what you can't afford to lose; Coinkite or Electrum. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:33:34
Any plans on making this work with a better multisig wallet like [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:24:05
I appreciate the heighten emotions but, if you have nothing to add it's better to avoid posting. Also, personal attacks really don't help.
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:50:27
I'm not Pro or Against, but this doesn't help with a quality discourse.
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:55:21
Very nice looking.
But doesn't say Bitcoin anywhere?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:55:09
Yes, but that's not what they are doing. I agree with free like this means will likely fail and go away.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:18:57
I can't wait, this is the project that bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:35:29
Could not think of a better response
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:52:11
Use magic! Kidding just here for the gold.
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:01:44
This happens on every rally
@_date: 2016-05-26 17:28:17
Nice! I hope they keep it open source
@_date: 2016-05-24 15:31:19
Good looking coins, but I rather have a Ledger or Opendime. This way no one else can have the private keys.
@_date: 2016-05-30 18:50:50
Both are good, but I think the secure element on Ledger is safer.
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:33:14
Only if not hardened, which most wallets do. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 22:31:07
I received my 10 pack today. This review nails it.
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:32:40
When I selected the shipping and qty it shows me price
@_date: 2016-07-29 22:58:05
The device is much smarter than that, it was the first thing I tried. It can't be reversed, i think it permanently changes a memory address.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:38:52
Yes, it popped, now it will take an hour to fully deflate. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:58:53
Oh, I will be back. As soon as the price crashes again :P
