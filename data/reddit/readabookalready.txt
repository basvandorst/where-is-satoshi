But what about the conspiracy? won't someone think about the conspiracy?!
Helen Lovejoy, Probably.

Keep in mind these computer may be far too expensive for the average users. Super cooling is expensive.
So large entities will have them, but us poor schmucks won't.

Of course you can't, you too small of an influence. 
Now imagine you had 100 times more coins can colluded with 100 other people who have a lot of coins.

The term "upgrade" in this instance is purely subjective.
OMG. Just.. just.. uhhg. I'm out.

"What did not improve was the money itself"
Blatantly false.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:18:28


Which is the sam as:
 extraordinary case and wouldn’t be very profitable for peope who make the money.
Every time I have heard that about currency or economics, the people who "make the money" find a way to abuse it.
Don't underestimate greed when money is on the line.

No, it isn't. Don't underestimate what billions of dollars and millions of computers can do.

You should use more question marks an exclamations. 
Anyway, later then month or next generally means end of this month beginning of the next.
In general, nor Reddit, human parlance, it's a colloquialism.

"maybe it's that we have a culture that founded Wikileaks"
Not something I'd be proud of if I were you. The 'cultivate' what and how they will releases in order to influence politics, not to make it open to all.

But no one will leave regardless, so the impact of their opinion will be: 0 (Zero).
" if the real consensus is against S2X"
I'm not sure of there is actual consensus, or an echo chamber making it seem like consensus.
How are you getting a specific opinion from all miners with a deep level understanding? Vs. Miner who don't.
And no, not all miners have a deep understanding of the math.
Please do not take this as an opinion one way or another.

"NO NEED to take 3.8 and multiply it by 2"
Clearly that's what you think, but the question is why do you think the is no need to do that?
I don't know, I'm just wondering what you are basing it on.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:37:24
Because they are idiots who would rather try and force a mistake to be right then admit they are wrong.
They are one of the reason bitcoin is slow to adoption in very serious markets.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:23:06
 It seems to me if you can get 50 bucks for it, then you should sell it, and then buy 50 bucks of bitcoin!

" By taking Moore’s law,"
Moore's law has been dead for nearly a decade.
When was the last time the transistors per sqr/cm doubled and price didn't change?
Do you even know it has to do with manufacturing cost and speed is just a by product due to the competitive avenues processor makers chose to take?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:17:08
 didn't know these existed, so I went to ebay. Why are people paying 50 dollars for a .001 bitcoin($7.80)?

It's implied.

No. Trading requires company performance, and a plethora of other variables.
They don't exist with Bitcoin. So once you get to a certain financial point, you can literal create free money.
Bitcoin is raw currency generation, don't think of it as stock trading. It's currency exchange. 
If you know how to read the right financial rags, you see this happen in small countries. Almost always ends in civil unrest.
Some outside buys currency, begin t bring in industry, currency jumps, the industry "fails" and the rich walk away richer, and the poor end up killing each other.
This is why countries like Zambia (kwacha)have laws forbid leaving the country with any of it's currency.
I've been out for a while, so I don'g know f that's still the law. I would be surprised if it isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:23:17
While it's worded poorly, in essence he is right. Pump and Dump on an object that has very few external variable is 'trivial' if the people doing it coordinate. Since there is no law to prevent collusion, well, it will happen.

Yes, but maybe not how you think it would.
In order to make Shor's slow enough for RSA to exist would mean terabyte keys.
Plus, current computer tech and history is not reasonable to compare to quantum computing.
At this point, it's likely to to very expensive just to operate a quantum computer.
That mean large entities will control not just the computing, but the computer to be ale to use terabyte keys.
This is just assume 1 Quantum computer.
That's called "Quantum supremacy", btw.
10^^^100 sounds like a lot, but with a bank of quantum computers, it's suddenly not very much.
In theory.
As a reminder: Classical quantum computer with n qubits can do 2n states at he exact same time.
