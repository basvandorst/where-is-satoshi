Looks like it was written by an eight year old.

Thought the same. When the EU played hardball with Cyprus, the price of BTC went on a surge as well, so this is not a precedence.
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:35:46
Gonna give it a try.

I remember a time where Bitcoin was praised for his anonymity. Now, there's at least one heavily upvoted post per week with the purpose to stalk individual addresses.

Facebook buys Oculus: "They don't really get 2 billion, it's FB stock, that's not even real money."
GSM employees get paid in bitcoin: "Oh wow, glad to see they're embracing change"

She'll relieve you of your ~~bitcoins~~ anxiety.

Seems like 3000 was just yesterday.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:18:45
That means yours too, so stop posting these.

I'm not sure whether pettiness towards the traditional financial institutions is the answer. And there's no proof either that bitcoin can't be used to launder money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:44:20
What's an ounce bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-10-26 08:33:24
Now to everyone who imagines finding that 5000BTC wallet. Imagine having it and knowing about it. How many heart attacks or suicide attempts would such a wallet have caused. The April bubble pop, the silk road bust. I don't think I could ever sleep a full night again when the next morning my million dollars could be cut in half.
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:02:24
I like your spirit.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:28:13
To be fair, I'd use a throwaway for these kind of posts. No one knows what an old account could tell people here.
@_date: 2013-11-06 11:34:31
Btw, what happened to the guy who "owed some dangerous men a lot of money" during the silk road bust crash? Anyone ever heard a follow-up?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:56:01
Thank you. The hate Mt.Gox recieves right now is totally overblown.

1. Season 5 Episode 11: "Homer the Vigilante"
Lisa: We are insured, aren't we, Mom?
Marge: Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance.
Homer: Curse you magic beans!
Marge: Oh, stop blaming the beans.
2. Season 3, Episode 19 "Dog of Death"
[Homer's fantasy of winning the lottery]
Lenny: Hey, Homer! Whatd'ya do, get a haircut or somethin'?
[Homer is revealed to be 12 feet tall &amp; made of gold]
Homer: Look closer, Lenny!
Lenny: Oh I see it, you're the biggest man in the world now. And you're covered in gold!
Homer: Fourteen karat gold!
[Heads to Mr. Burns' office]
Homer: Take a hike, Boss. I'm running things now!
Mr. Burns: All hail King Homer!
[Fantasy ends showing Homer encrusted with jewels and wearing a crown, standing over the city and laughing evilly.]

Yeah, I was wondering if they'd follow their lead yesterday, glad to see it went so fast. Just ordered there a week or two ago.
Germany is a huge market, this can only be good.

I now want my "I was there" survivor shirt.
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:43:21
Now not only the exchanges, even the tickers are starting to go down. This is getting out of hand.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:53:32
Ask them if they'd do a refund :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:43:00
But we still want to phase out Mt.Gox, right?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:33:54
And now your brother is known to the whole world as Satoshi :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:27:37


Like, buying litecoins? :)
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:55:08
Just when I thought "this has finally been relatively stable for more than a day".
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:48:02
This could revolutionize prostitution!
Ok, I'll show myself out :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:35:55
This has really shown how entitled and greedy the bitcoin community has become over the last weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:08:21
No news on the funds on the Polish account though. Bad luck for me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:33:46
With the amount of money that has been injected in the bitcoin ecosystem within the last two weeks, I'd be really surprised if the financial system isn't already part of this.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:30:17
Looks like he hasn't met the army yet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:31:42
Oh wow.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:17:36
I hope this won't lead to easier financial backing of destabilizing forces in Africa. There's always two sides of a medal.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:04:24
good day to sit sick at home :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:43:29
And it looks like they won't process my deposit either.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:41:39
Crush them, drive them before you and hear the lamentations of their other children.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:03:33
I'm the one who has to thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:47:10
The second you announce it, it isn't your sole decision anymore. This has so many potential traps and pitfalls, I wouldn't risk it.
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:52:33
Even in my bumblefuck hometown of 10.000 I suddenly have eight new options to spend btc.

As the saying goes: Rich become those who sell too early.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:40:32
This reeks of OWS/"kill the financial system" rhetoric. I'm not too fond of antagonizing the rest of the industry.
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:46:06
As soon as China reaches 2000 yuan maybe.
