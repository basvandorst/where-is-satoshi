As per media reports, inter-ministerial committee has been setup to study the legality of bitcoins. They will give a response on 20th April 2017. All stakeholders will be called to represent.

There are no predictions when it comes to bitcoin but here are some buying recommendations:
1100$ and below : Strong Buy
Around 1150 : Risky in short term but buy if in for long term

Last time I read, the chances of approval was around 15%. Well if it gets approved, hurrah for everyone but I would not put my hopes too high and prepare for the drop. The job of the SEC is to secure the retail customer and with the volatility that bitcoin has, it might be tough.

Switch to BTC instead of USD

Don't depend upon etf for profits. It's just a gamble. I would suggest you to wait for the drop or make the small investment right now and the rest of it after the etf decision

Snapchat IPO and Bitcoin ETF are two entirely different things. The SEC members have to be entirely objective about it. Well maybe bitcoin is the future.. But is it the right time? IDK

Intentions won't change the meaning of volume.

When you reach near the week's average lowest.

What kind of effect is it going to have on the price?? Any ideas?
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:05:22
It can't go left. So you're wrong there.

Bitcoin and blockchain are two different things again. Everyone is positive about blockchain. Bitcoin is kind of like 50:50

Dude do you even understand what "volume" means? You are talking about total value of transactions. There's a big difference in both.

Reliability? DO you use is personally?
