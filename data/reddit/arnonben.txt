I don't think it is possible with the Ethereum technology, you need to have smart contract that can be triggered by external oracle, from what I know, Ethereum is not capable to do so. The Fusion Blockchain on the other hand had this option of external oracle with voting mechanism.

There must be some more advanced solution for crypto will specially for death validation, maybe  Dead Man’s Switch could obligate that one of the verifies will be the regulator itself.

Tether will not be relevant soon. Only stablecoins which are backed by real financial institutions can be liable.
