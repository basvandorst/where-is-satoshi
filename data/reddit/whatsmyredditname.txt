Property abandonment could be argued.

Sounds like they are passively calling for regulation.

I'm afraid to sign in case its taken seriously.

That's how it works. For obvious reasons they can't tell you what about these transactions triggered the block, since a criminal would use that information to avoid triggering red flags. They also can't tell you what crimes they are afraid you are commiting, that would make the agent a slanderer. It's an impossible situation to rectify.

Western Union agent here. Since this is a semi anon forum I'll just tell you that until bitcoin has any sort of governmental regulation that the legally correct thing for Western Union to do is shut you down; if that's even why. There are several reasons for this but the biggest one is that there are layers upon layers upon layers of red tape designed to prevent money laundering. bitcoin is seen as an untraceable money instrument. Western Union will not reverse their decision You can hope the block is temporary, if it is never ever use it to receive money for bitcoins; if that is why you were blocked. I don't know what other red flags your particular transactions triggered, and for legal reasons I am unwilling/unable to make any sort of supposition, or comment should you reveal the nature of the transfers in question. 
As a person I know that Western Union rules and regulations can seem very very archaic. There are days that I'd swear they are just gangsters of a different sort, but really there are so many laws and regulations in place that I can't even begin to discuss. I know that the brick walls that other agents throw up are them following the next level ups rules and regulation. I'm sorry for your trouble.

That is not something I know. To my knowledge a block is a block, and the only person I've had the displeasure of dealing with who was blocked had a lifetime block.
