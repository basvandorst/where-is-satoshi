I'd bank my money that somebody got in through some rather mundane method, it happens to the biggest of companies out there.
If it is, then they could be going down for gross negligence.

If you held your investments with an unproven exchange that's outside of your jurisdiction, in a volatile digital currency - then I'd assume you'd have done thorough research and in a case like this, having known the risks, you'd be ready to write off your investment.
Never invest money you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:38:54
This should be the policy of any bank, exchange etc - but sadly it's not.
These guys will end up in some deep shit. But rules don't apply to large banks.

It's not about uploading the image, it's about how many visitors download that image.
Let's say you run a small website. The picture on your page is 1mb. If 10 people visit your site, with each person requesting the page and downloading the image, it uses 10mb of bandwidth just for the image.
Now let's say you run a bigger website, and your site gets 1 million views in a month. That's ~1 TB of bandwidth.
Now remember that's the bandwidth just for the image. That's not including other images, CSS, JS and the page itself.

Now I've had a chance to look at it, it's a really nice little site. 
Let's hope it stays at NO for the foreseeable future!

You mad fool! Best of luck to you.

I bought in when Bitcoins were £4. Now they're £52.
I can only see the trend going up.
Bitcoin is 'deflating', which is the opposite of inflation. Unlike US dollars, where they'll be worth less at the end of the working day than when you started, Bitcoins only go up in value. This means if you invest some money in Bitcoin, the value will only increase.
My advice: Invest in Bitcoin ASAP and actually use it as a currency. Buying into Bitcoin to make a quick buck is pointless and harms the economy. Buy your Bitcoins and buy online goods with them.

But bitcoin levels the playing field, so people living in third world countries will be able to break out of poverty.

I've been handing out a few Bitcoins to people interested in getting into Bitcoins. I'm also starting a project with my local Markerspace and Council to build and get a bitcoin vending machine put in our town centre.
The key to bitcoin's success is getting people to adopt and USE them.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:06:22
Any luck with MtGox or is every exchange having troubles?
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:49:43
As of yet, no-one will give you interest. But, bitcoin is a deflationary currency, meaning it will gain value the longer you leave it (unlike US dollars which lose value).
Store them in an online wallet, or create an offline backup.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:08:27
And HOW are they going to enforce this?
The idea that this will "put a damper on Russia’s shadow economy" is absurd. Criminal don't obey the law, so why will they follow this?
The government can't control cash transactions.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:34:49
I LOVE Bitcoin's potential for micropayments, but I think each website is going to have to implement their own method of tipping people. A service would work, but centralization isn't the answer IMO.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:42:42
So what exactly is this?
Also homepage doesn't work.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:38:14
I agree with [Rick Falkvinge's]( idea that the ideal price for 1BTC would be about $100,000 - $1M.
It will take a long time to get there, if at all.

As a lot of threads have been saying, the fact Bitcoin has received recognition from the US Gov is irrelevant.
If you want to achieve greatness, stop asking for permission.
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:15:58
My predicition is that everything will carry on much the way it is now, but they'll be a lot more emphasis on charging tax on online sales, and even trying to get online wallets providers to start charging their users' tax. on their accounts.
I'd be surprised if governments started accepting bitcoin for your council tax bill anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:30:30
Although no-one can actually control Bitcoin. THey can control the exchanges like mtGox, but not the network itself or the transactions.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:02:22
Only time will tell, but I doubt it will survive. As much as the Eurocrats want their crackpot dream to work.
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:58:47
So you made yet another post...
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:40:28
This just highlights the need for Bitcoin. My bank will sometimes cancel transactions if it's quite large, since I don't normally make large transactions.
But this just seems like they flat out dont want to send your money.
There's no point fighting a bank, they will not budge.
You're best making smaller transactions or switching banks.
The big thing about Bitcoin is that no-one other than you controls your money. The fractional reserve banking system is what has ensalved everyone and caused this mess.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:04:33
It's still early days, We'll have to wait a few years before Bitcoin finds it's true value.
But Bitcoin needs to be stable before it can be used on a daily basis by the majority.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:03:23
So many people having trouble with Coinbase, it doesn't sound too good.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:49:23
There are a lot of ideas floating around, I don't think we've reached the gold rush just yet. Give it time and they'll be an influx of entrepreneurs trying to grab a slice of Bitcoin (it's already starting now)
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:29:13
If bitcoin gains mainstream adoption, 90% of people are going to be storing their Bitcoins in online wallets.
These centralized online wallets ultimately have to abide by the laws in their countries of residence, just like websites do.
It's through this that governments will tax and charge fees.
Yes, "If a site like coinbase started snitching to the government about your holdings" people might well switch, but banks already do this and it's an accepted part of finance.
Online Merchants already charge VAT and would be expected to do so under bitcoin.
Governments will still charge and receive their taxes, you'll be sure about that.

The growth is inevitable, but it'll be a while yet before Bitcoin is mainstream. When bitcoin starts to stabilize, confidence in it will grow.

Armory has quite a few features that other wallets are lacking, like multiple wallets.
There's a good little comparison at the bottom of this article
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:11:12
The problem with Bitcoin is exactly this, it's growing to fast.
The growth is good, but it's not stable. If I were to invest my savings into Bitcoin I'd want to be confident that the price won't flucuate.
Right now Bitcoin is rising, but Bitcoin has a history of price fluctuations and crashes.
Stability is what we need for mainstream adoption.

The target value for 1BTC is $1,000,000.
If that were reached today, the total market value would be around $10950975000000 or $10.9 Trillion
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:43:34
Would be pretty damn awesome, any use of bitcoin is cool, and when I can integrate bitcoin with my daily life it's even cooler.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:49:34
That "good ‘ol maths" seems to be correct.
1% of $69 Trillion is $690 Billion.

I do this all the time, I think DuckDuckGo is working on a BTC converter through their DuckDuckHack programme.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:54:10
I'd maybe even do higher than that.
But it will be at least a few years before we hit a stable figure.
@_date: 2013-03-19 10:34:30
I'm sceptical. I'm fully behind Bitcoin and I've invested a fair amount of money into it, but I really want the price to stabilize before I can use it on a daily basis.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:35:33
You could buy Bitcoins, I know it's not exactly what you're asking for but Investing in Bitcoin by buying Bitcoins isn't a bad start.
You could invest in the infrastructure by taking part in Bitcoin mining. You can buy an ASIC or FPGA rig and start effectively running your own 'bitcoin mint' from your home.
Or just do it the old fashioned way by investing in someone who's got a cool idea.

I'm not sure about tipping, I think offering people something compelling is a much better way of monetizing content.
If I come across someone who's written a genuinely good article and helped me, I'll gladly tip them a few BTC, the same as I would a musician who's music I've just downloaded.
But it isn't a one size fits all. The majority of journalists are going to have to offer something else, like an ebook or something that the reader actually wants.
Bitcoins will be the biggest change to the web since Google Adwords.

Welcome to the club! Bitcoin is the easiest way of transferring funds and it'll only get easier.

The Euro is dead. Now for the rest of the world economy to follow. Bitcoin shall rise like a phoenix from the ashes.
