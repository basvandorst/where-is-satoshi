Man, if losing a few bucks out of $80 gives you anxiety, you don't need to be playing in bitcoin, or any other speculation. You should only use money you don't give a fuck about, i.e. discretionary income you'd otherwise blow.

Nah, haven’t seen too many “fucked your mom” or racial comments. This is more like the low level character in WoW sitting outside the auction house begging for “just” a couple gold.

It works the same (ie is taxed) for any other currency, security, property, technology, etc. you invest and make a gain in. Bitcoin is not uniquely singled out for taxation, you’re being a little dramatic. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:05:24
Just fyi, converting BTC to USDT (or anything other asset, currency, etc.) is a taxable event in the US.

Buying in when you get paid *is* dollar cost averaging, lmao.

That’s an absolutely shitty return on investment capital, lol, and it assumes that the story is even true, that you will find it, that it will still work, and it won’t cost you more than it’s worth to find it.

Except it isn't... you just fraudulently didn't declare an asset in a legal proceeding. It's no different than omitting you have $x of cash stuffed in your mattress. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:24:50
I only throw in my discretionary money left over at the end of each month. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:13:36
Capital losses offset taxes from capital gains, so they pretty much already do.

Use limit trades and make sure post only is enabled and you will pay zero fees ����

Converting your money into bitcoin *isn’t* a taxable event (in the US). Realizing a capital gain, regardless of asset, is. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:03:13
You clearly just don’t understand master trader lingo ��

Transfer money from your bank to your coinbase USD wallet - no fees. Transfer that money to GDAX - no fees. Place a limit (not market) order on GDAX - no fees. This process will take 7-10 days. If you want to get in RIGHT NOW, then you will need to pay a fee unless you already have money loaded into coinbase/gdax.

Simple explanation: Zoom out on the price chart then go look at textbook bubble examples.

That’s if he has zero other income. He will be taxed at his current marginal rate, wherever that falls in the income brackets. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:21:01
Bitcoin takes a shit when people sell very little of them (compared to market cap); it works the same way in reverse. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:50:28
Depends on his income level, not the amount of capital gains by itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:32:07
It’s minutes even without an ID. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:15:02


So, pretty much exactly like every assumption currently made on bitcoin, then... lol. You're just trying to shit on IOTA at every turn, not have a conversation, and no I don't really know anything about it currently nor do I invest in it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:48
[lol]( 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:24:30
Which is what I just said - it depends on his income level as to how much taxes he pays. Your initial blanket statement is only true under a very specific scenario - he must not have any other income and must have held the investment for one year.

to learn more about how to mine other coins with a PC. It’s not worthwhile to mine BTC with one anymore because it will cost you way more than you generate. You may or may not break even with a PC setup in the short term but you’ll have a subsidized or fully paid for sweet gaming rig haha.

Yea, he’s not like an absurd giant or anything but those couple inches make a difference dude. I’m 6’3” and my brother is 6’0” and I have a hard time on most airplanes while he does not (yes we’ve flown together many times and he thinks it’s fucking hilarious I can’t get comfortable much less sleep while he snoozes). He owns a miata that I can’t comfortably sit in for any period of time. Hell, even the work/lab benches at work I have to stoop to use if I don’t want to sit on a stool. I feel for anybody that’s much taller because the world truly caters to about 5’10” people whether it be seating, table top heights, or whatever. You don’t think it’s a big deal because you don’t live with it, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:38:03
If you trade in traditional currencies, that shit is still taxed, it’s just at your normal rate by default, which is pretty much always higher than the Long term capital gains rate unless you have very little or no income. 
Did you think you wouldn’t owe taxes on realized gains on this particular currency?  (Edit: in the US). I believe it was 2014 when the IRS formally issued guidance on how to pay them specifically for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:04:30
Serious question: why is it a scam? Pretty new to crypto currency, but not new to investing, trading (stock only), personal finance, etc. if that makes any difference to how you’d approach explaining it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:28:13
If you’re in the US you are legally obligated to pay taxes irrespective of the currency, security, or property that you speculated on / invested in if you made any capital gains. You owe it when the gains are realized, ie when you sell or exchange your coins for something else of value.
