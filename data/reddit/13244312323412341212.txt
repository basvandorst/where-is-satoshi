It is a matter of priorities.

Oh I'm talking about updating the client to add in new features or to change the basic structural processes of the algorithm. If it was 100% bad people you could maybe increase the amount of total bitcoins which would benefit people with less bitcoins. The top 1% would be opposed but the bottom 99% would accept the new client and use it. That top 1% would be screwed as the value of their bitcoins is diluted.

hahaha, yes there is.

He's probably sticking his dick in the power supply right now.
and now you have that image in your head....good luck getting rid of that.
@_date: 2013-05-19 20:54:35
wow that site is great!

It would probably be something related to how they could make as much money for themselves.
@_date: 2013-05-19 16:52:32
right, well one of the big advantages of bitcoin is anonymous.
@_date: 2013-05-19 23:55:10
As far as I know, nope.

Most likely they will put currency controls to make it as hard as possible to move fiat into btc and vice versa. Hence the reason we need to quickly move into pure btc transactions, as much as possible.
Governments do the same thing when their currencies become unstable - they close banks, limit transaction amounts, seize funds, prevent money from flowing outside of the country so on so forth. Often times, the politically connected get to move their money offshore while the poor and middle class gets wiped out.
People take it for granted that the USD is stable. You don't know how long that will last, most people in countries that experienced hyperinflation never saw it coming until it was too late.
[hyperinflation in Zimbabwe](
I'm honestly surprised that african countries haven't flocked to bitcoin, especially considering what they've seen.

We will see the exploit long before that time.
@_date: 2013-05-19 09:25:17
so much for bitcoin being an anonymous payment system, atleast for the average joe.
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:42:30


yup but even if you tried to remain anonymous it isn't easy. What are you going to do? wear a mask and do a face to face transaction? lol.
Any online transaction is for sure recorded and logged forever.
@_date: 2013-05-18 22:58:03
unless it gets lost in the mail, then add additional 6-8 weeks.
@_date: 2013-05-20 05:45:29
Yup, it is called the [wealth effect](
@_date: 2013-05-19 23:20:55
Yup, exactly.
At this point, we need more exposure for bitcoin. Even negative publicity helps too.
I heard about bitcoin through a forum on gold and silver. They talked alot of crap on it but I did my research and loved the idea.

This is one of the most important concepts for people to understand: the underlying bitcoin algorithm can be completely modified as long as everyone updates to that new client. People will only update if the updates are beneficial to them and the overall community of bitcoin users.
If there is ever some serious serious issue with bitcoin then there would be a huge meeting called and the community would discuss how to deal with it. As long as the majority of the community agrees to the changes then we can update the algorithm. There are more good people than bad.
@_date: 2013-05-18 23:16:55
yeah, ideally the transactions will be free and the company will offer other services for a fee.
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:40:31
yup that's true but if you think about it even if you wanted to remain anonymous, it would be extremely difficult to do in this day and age.
You would have to pay all cash in a face to face transaction and even then there are still ways to figure out who you are.
