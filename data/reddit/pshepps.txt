All money is based on nothing, only difference is there is no scarcity in the other ones...
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:24:05
I disagree. I've bought stuff on there already. It works and the theory is sound. And it's anonymous
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:49:41
Is that short for mathematics or mathematic?
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:27:18
That whole argument of definition annoys me.
Does it store value, can you exchange small bits of it for goods? Those are the only questions you need to answer...
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:24:53
You haven't coinjoined then I guess! ;)
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:32:11
Only if you're in the US. Here in CH there are no taxes on capital gains... ;)
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:29:35
Goodness gracious, why is lightning missing from your argument? Bit like saying you have to move gold bullion around the central banking system to buy a hotdog ��
@_date: 2019-11-28 23:23:01
Hmmm - I think you're slightly over-pessimistic, but even if not... To go from non-existent to "full time adoption" in 12-13 years is nothing short of remarkable...
Your parents don't need to know what's under the hood just as most people don't understand cars, they just point and drive...
@_date: 2019-11-28 23:17:36
Say what? I didn't state anything about bitcoin being gold bullion, I used that as a silly and incorrect analogy to point out the flaw in your own statement. I also disagree that lightning's state is "buggy" and unreliable. It works well and will become more optimised with time...

Hodling doesn't work when purchasing. There's always "a bigger boat"
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:22:26
What's "silver" ?
@_date: 2019-12-01 09:19:27
!bottle 100 sat for your amazing game!
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:10:18
Let me know how you get on with bottle! Drop me a line  on Telegram!
@_date: 2019-12-13 17:43:29
No no I guarantee you I have an atm next to my house that requires no data, accepts cash and claims the limit is chf5000 per day
@_date: 2019-12-01 09:22:01
!bottle 10000 sat - so here you go for your donation! (The 100 was me testing the Bottle Pay bot :D)
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:33:19
Say what? You're kidding obviously about Obama...
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:33:35
Come to SwItzerland! Chf5000 limit per day, totally anonymous...
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:17:36
You can with AMP. I think C-lightning just brought it out
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:45:45
And further reading shows that the "dead" guy was indeed a founder of a crypto company. Goes to show you should REALLY read the entire article first!
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:20:57
It's not dishonest if the fee is 0 cents when rounded
@_date: 2019-12-14 06:52:39
Never tried them...
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:19:45
3sats probably rounds up to $0.00 - so he's probably correct after all
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:43:57
So it seems the joke is on this redditor. Whilst I do not like the Mail one bit the title on the Mail's website was "Investors want body of Bitcoin trader, 30, exhumed amid fears he may STILL be alive and living off embezzled fortune after he 'died' on his India honeymoon taking investors' $137M to the grave"
Perhaps some rudimentary research before posting is necessary??? Especially if you are slapping media for agreeing fake news...
Oh! Interesting... The link has the false title but the title itself is different.
You're partially forgiven, but still: check first!

If she had cashed out in 2022 then it would have been somewhere even better than Puerto Rico
@_date: 2019-04-22 14:44:25
It's usage will grow, lightning is growing fast. But these things take time. Interesting times for sure, now that programmable money and micropayments are "a thing"...
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:59:14
Lightning wasn't around in 2012, so.... ;)
It is nascent and growing very very rapidly. I'll sell you a node!
@_date: 2019-04-22 16:32:22
It's only months old and in % growth it's doing fine. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.
Your comments are valid for on-chain transfers but once tier 2 and tier 3 are up and running...
Basically we only got the "http" layer now, so no surprises nothing much happened until now..
Guess we'll see...
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:55:50
I haven't played but I'll give you 10000 Sats! Do you have a Bottle Pay ID or a lightning enabled wallet.
Let's go offchain on this! ;)
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:16:04
Nah your points are valid, I'm not into labelling people "shills" or otherwise, every point of view is valid. I'm excited about the technology and off others are not cautious that's their right.
And we are all allowed to be wrong too :)
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:59:54
We will go up and down that is 100% certain. To fix an arbitrary value at 9k as magic is a fool's errand. The average "floor" will rise, that is all that is important.
And remember, you are measuring it against USD. That becomes irrelevant after the flippening.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:55:19
Flawed logic I am afraid. We discovered it in 2024 on the 30th of May and found we can only go back 5 years exactly. This is hence the first time we are able to tell humanity.
Don't despair, we are still funny in 5 years time!
One tip: hodl
Over and out
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:03:16
Flawed logic. It doesn't have to be infinite in time travel distance. In 2024 we can only tell you guys from now onwards...
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:57:27
What is an "alt coin"? Oh wait I can Google this in my archives.
Hahaha, you are still believing THAT?
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:00:27
What's a lambo. Had to ask...
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:55:51
I remember those! Saw a few! Got the 100th ever farming cape :) - the hard way!
