Just build more video cards.  How hard is it?  Order more components. Order more wafers.  Rinse, repeat.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:16:14
I bought more on the dip.  Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:58:59
Paypal.... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  No.

I love BitFlyer.  Verification was fast and wires are very fast.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:35:26
What are people selling into?  Tethers?  USD?  
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:54:21
Hodl, baby!
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:28:37
Bad math.  1.5 million coins would be approx 10%.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:09:12
Doesn't the US Marshal's BTC auction end today at 3:30PM EST?  Every time in the past when there has been an auction the price has been pushed down like this.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:30:46
Just looking for more weak hands.  We will keep doing this until they panic sell.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:17:33
Translation:  Please sell so I can get out of my short position.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:18:53
weak hands.  gotta clean them out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:37:03
weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:11
Every time Bitcoin goes up we need a pullback to weed out the weak hands.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:30:51
I still have mine.  It is a very low serial number.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:55:38
Were the wallets password protected?  Did you have a wallet backup?  What is your bitcoin address?  Are the coins still there?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:56:01
Try again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:51
What's the point of posts like this? Just contributing to the echo chamber?
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:06:31
Hodl my plums!
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:09:09
This is how it begins.
@_date: 2019-03-22 13:31:36
This is so sketchy.  Reminds me of Bitconnect.
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:20:05
I created an account as well but all it asked for was an email and a password.  Where do you put in all your personal information?  I would think because they are offering interest they would need at least an ID and your SSN.  Maybe they ask for it when you try to withdrawal or maybe I just didn't see where to upload a photo ID, etc.
@_date: 2019-11-26 02:19:41
Thank you all for the cheap coins!
@_date: 2019-03-18 17:20:54
They bought in at $12.  They are fine.
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:30:18
Please keep pushing it down!  I need 6600 to fill my orders.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:49:30
I have some coins that I would never sell, no matter what the price is.  HODL!
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:51:49
Deposit the money 3 months before you buy a house.  Then the money is considered "seasoned" and they won't care where it came from.
@_date: 2019-08-27 03:32:23
Depends on power price.
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:05:42
The greedy bitch wants her cut.
@_date: 2019-10-16 21:46:02
Excellent!  Try that with cash.
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:32:07
I use Bitflyer.  Easy as pie.  You can do ACH up to 2K and over that I wire in funds.  Usually takes 4 hours to credit to my account.
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:58:55
This is a BTC run on the bank.  Let's see if there are enough coins for everyone to jump ship.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:28:58
Never all of it.  Just sell when I need to and buy on the dips.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:13:30
Better close those shorts fast!
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:50:36
BitConnect2 coming sooooooooooon!  
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:14:42
Domain registered 10 days ago.  Looks legit.  /s
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:52:10
Amazon has been accepting Bitcoin for years.  Just use a Bitpay debit card.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:26:03
Do you even Bitcoin, Bro?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:06:28
They are going to make their own tether so it won't affect anything.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:47:32
Sometimes the API is down and they drop off for a while.  I have seen this happen before.  
Edit:  Told ya.  They are back.
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:06:03
You will melt the GPU before you even make 1 penny worth of BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:09:48
You can reverse an ACH for a few days so they wait until it clears before they release the coins.  Otherwise thieves would buy coins and reverse the charges. Same thing when you ACH money into Ameritrade.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:47:03
Hey all you weak hands please just sell now so we can get this over with. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:21:43
Why don't all you weak hands just sell and get it over with?  
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:53:29
You will lose your coin and money from paypal when it gets reversed.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:46:08
I would like some info.  What is the fluid?  What size heat exchanger do you have outside? Where did you get that beautiful container?  Pump size?  How did you do a failsafe in case the pump fails?
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:29:51
So the ASIC's are free in Venezuela?  Free hosting?  Or is your math for 1 ASIC?  How long does it take to mine that Bitcoin?  Difficulty increases?
You also have to figure there is a 50% chance your ASIC will crap out within the year.  
Once you do all that math you are over 10K easily to mine a bitcoin, even with very cheap electricity. &lt; .03USD/Kwh

It's twue, it's twue!

Why don't all you weak hands just sell and get it over with?  
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:24:52
You have to play a certain amount of games with the match money before you can withdrawal it.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:33:57
Me too.  I just use my Bitpay debit card to buy from Amazon.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:41:28
Dammit.  I started a little early.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:58:27
Good.  We don't need fiat sucking the liquidity out of BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:03:42
That is a good way to lose your coins and your money after they charge it back.  They can charge it back up to 6 months later, even friends and family payments.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:15:22
Lot of FUD out there today trying to push the price down.  Everyone should sell right now so I don't get liquidated!
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:18:37


@_date: 2018-04-13 13:31:48
Inside job.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:20:01
The shorts are pulling out all the FUD today!
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:49:16
Yep.  I am still waiting for the gigantic red panic dildo.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:37:06
It took me about a week.  Go check your Tier 3 verify page and see if there are any errors on that page.  It took me like 3 times to get the ID verify pic right.

Use all the Quantum computers you want.  The odds that the Earth will explode in the next 5 seconds are better than hacking even one bitcoin address in the next 1000 years using all the computers on Earth.
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:30:31
Jizz in my pants..
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:50:05
Did you use Amazon gift cards from Paxful to buy the items?
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:02:43
I hope you aren't using Paxful.  Get ready to lose your Amazon account if you are.
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:47:21
In 3 days that number goes to $9200.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:55:20
1) Get a bitpay debit card.
2) Load the card with BTC and it auto converts to USD.
3) Take out cash at ATM.
You can also send USD from your Bitpay debit card to your Ameritrade account, then move it to your bank account.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:12:48
Never sell.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:15:48
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:17:34
How many amps do you have available in the basement?  Also how do you plan to exhaust the heat?  What about the noise?  S9's are loud AF.
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:37:53
Easy.  Never sell.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:19:46
You sell it for pennies on the dollar. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:59:52
Gotta clean out the greedy fucks before we can go up.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:33:03
*Ding ding* ding Gutter, tell him what he's won!
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:44:40
Do they let you buy with change yet?
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:48:57
What is the most you can buy in a day?  
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:49:30
Can't get out of that short position?  
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:40:03
He endured all that for 59K?  Damn.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:11:03

Just wait until your hear how loud 1 S7 or S9 is.
