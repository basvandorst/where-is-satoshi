Why does uninsured per capita matter for QoL?
Australia has universal healthcare.
If you need to go to the hospital or doctors you don't pay anything for treatment or scans etc.
And if you want fast, extra care for non emergency visits you can pay or use private health insurance so either way you're set.
My family would've paid tens of thousands of dollars for our health problems and we were poor. I didnt have to pay for my cancer treatment and radiation and scans. Nor did I pay for my stint in drug rehab nor the weekly doctor appointments.
I only paid for medicine which was really cheap and my psychologist which was covered by like 70%.
Now I have private health and pay taxes because I and my family worked hard and didnt have a massive debt burden. 
Im proud and lucky to have lived in Australia. Its great for families and individuals who want a happy and free life.

Link them the transaction ID on blockchain.info  to prove you sent to the correct address and see how many confirmations it has.
Once if its been confirmed a few times and the address they gave you went through, then they should oblige with the purchase since you did everything correct and its something on their end.
After a bit of time, if they still wont listen, call their support to escalate the issue if possible with your evidence and then if it still isn't worked out then you'll need to make a decision on how to pursue it through a lawyer or name them publically to put some pressure on them.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:40:29
At least they work. Cheap transactions and fast.
I dont see why BTC cant increase blocksize by even a little bit more until we have LN.
Ive always been optimistic about bitcoins future but for a while we'very had high fees and low tx times without a solution.
Other currencies like dash, litecoin, bitcoin cash, PIVX and ether etc have been keeping up quite well with little or no division in scaling and other resolutions. 
What are the btc devs doing? LN has taken them way too long that even if they release next year I would feel it took them too long unless they code a perfect long term solution, which may not happen.

they've also been banning people for no reason.
I think they're using blockchain risk analysis tools to ban people permanently for sending BTC to addresses that *might* be buying drugs but many people have only withdrawn to their personal address and arent using dnms.
I think Independent Reserve is the best option for Aussies or even CoinSpot if you want more alt coins but higher fees.

Btc has already been pumped too much.
It might go up a shit tonne but if the current state continues exchanges will offer more base pairs since people want more speed and less fees. I think altcoins will rise in the long term cerebus paribus.

Not really but its a major factor in the increasing adoption for bch while bitcoin is gaining initial mainstream investors but vendors dropping it.

When you say "types" of coins, that not really specific, you can split coins up into different categories depending on their:
1. **Consensus algorithm:** (PoS, PoW, DPoS, PoC, BFT etc)
2. **Types of Blockchains:** (Private, Public, Federated/Consortium)
3. **Chain/Data Structure:** (Blockchain, DAG)
4. **Hashing Algorithm/Function:** (SHA-256, Grostl, Ethash/SHA-3, zhash/Equihash, scrypt, BLAKE(2b), Quark, CryptoNight, X11, Skein, Lyra2z etc)
5. **Legal Category:** (Currency, Utility Tokens, Security Tokens [Asset-backed, Equity/Share-like] etc)
6. **Use-case/Purpose:** (Currency, dApp Platform, Privacy, Prediction Market, Social Media, Governance, IoT, Marketplafce, Data Storage, Payments Platform etc)
7. **Technical Layer:** (Blockchain-Native, Non-Native Protocol Coin, d/App Tokens etc)
And many other categories that you can use. Let's take Bitcoin as the first example, starting from the top, respectively it would be: PoW &gt; Public &gt; Blockchain &gt; SHA-256 &gt; Currency &gt; Currency &gt; Blockchain-Native
Whereas something like Etherium would be: PoW &gt; Public &gt; Blockchain &gt; Ethash &gt; Utility? &gt; dApp Platform &gt; Blockchain-Native
Now let's do some other coins, just to make your homework easier ;)
Stellar: BFT (SCP) &gt; Federated &gt; Blockchain &gt; ? &gt; Utility/Currency &gt; Currency/Payment Platform &gt; Blockchain-Native
Siacoin: PoW &gt; Public &gt; Blockchain &gt; BLAKE(2b) &gt; Utility &gt; Data Storage &gt; Blockchain-Native
Digix: Proof-of-Asset/Provenance &gt; Public &gt; Blockchain &gt; IPFS (Multihash) &gt; Security (Asset-backed for DGX, Share-like for DGD) &gt; Asset Management &gt; Blockchain-Native
Nano: DPoS+PoW* &gt; Public &gt; DAG (block-lattice) &gt; BLAKE2 &gt; Currency &gt; Currency &gt; Blockchain-Native
IOTA: PoW* &gt; Public &gt; DAG (Tangle) &gt; Curl &gt; Utility &gt; IoT &gt; Blockchain-Native
Asterix (*) denotes that the PoW is not important or a trivial implementation.
I was in a rush so apologies for the poor formatting and if there are any errors. However it shows that coins can be separated and categorised into many different groups. For your presentation, it may be better to use  - Use Case/Purpose as the definition to separate "types" of coins because it's simple for everyone to understand without much technical knowledge and it shows just how vast the ecosystem is. It may also be important to touch on categories  and  since they are also important.
@_date: 2018-09-06 10:01:48
It's either manipulation or dumb luck. The market is irrational in the short-term.
Even if it is manipulation, which I hate saying because I'm sick of the "drop=manipulation!" posts it shouldn't be a big deal because the manipulators would just be dropping the price, buying in lower and selling for the possible BAKT bullrun or ETF decision.
That's just one possible scenario though and in the end, it's pointless unless you're day-trading. Short-term volatility means nothing to me apart from gauging an entry point.

I don't see how anyone could track terrorists on a decent privacy coin, unless it's on an exchange with KYC/AML in a co-operating jurisdiction. Then again I'm sure that won't be a simple task either.

Like the other user said, it doesn't always work that way. And the government/law enforcement may be able to force you to write/update it through the use of secret courts, National Security Letters or even dirty methods like blackmail and threats which some agencies have been prone to in the past. Even Australia outlawed some types of warrant canaries in 2015.
It's the era of the "national security" excuse by governments, so although these methods are interesting and worth trying - I wouldn't expect it to be full-proof all the time given the authoritarian nature of government.

I love the idea of warrant canaries and try to sites that have them like ProtonMail, AzireVPN, Tutanota, Veracrypt, IVPN etc.
There's a site called [Canary Watch]( that watches a list of sites using warrant canaries but it's not updated any more. 
Unfortunately, warrant canaries aren't perfect though and choosing to take down the canary (thus alerting users of government breach) can also be against the law and the government may force the site or company to keep/update the canary as usual otherwise face legal action - and possibly blackmail.

Posts like this are some bs. Every little thing is a "coordinated attack" on bitcoin. And then you guys just call other Cryptos shitcoins.
Your developers have failed you. Other Cryptos will rise as bitcoin is stuck in the past. LN has been been a proof of concept for years. Devs refuse to increase block sizes by even a little. They are stuck in the past.
BCH isn't even one of my favourite coins, yet it beats bitcoin in every way. Block size increase for cheaper fees and faster tx times, multiple dev groups and a more open community compared to Bitcoins dinosaur tech and stubborn devs who wont do shit.
Once the public realises Bitcoin is inferior, and it doesn't change, the big boys will take the reigns.

I understand the *average* is 10 minutes, but how common are longer/shorter times. I thought +/- a few minutes was most common and I'm curious how often it takes 70+ minutes.
Would there be any benefit to reducing the time it takes for a difficulty adjustment?
EDIT: It looks like a block was eventually mined at roughly 75 minutes but my questions still stand.

Open an account and get verified with an exchange like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken or another one depending on your country, or go to LocalBitcoins.com and register.
Send the Bitcoins from the Edge wallet to the address with whatever platform you're using, find a buyer or click sell and voila.
Does this answer your questions or do you need more specific advice?

What does "group ownership" convey?
As in give the server or domain name rights to multiple Bitcoin figureheads? Because that's just the same thing we had before with extra steps.

I completely agree with you here and I feel that the rest of the community is over-reacting.
I'm not a huge fan of BCH myself as I don't like *how* they promote their project with under-handed tactics and their leaders are questionable *at best*.
However I don't think we should all shun Cobra just because he sees *one* positive aspect in them which is big blocks.
Of course everyone has their own personal opinions on the degrees of decentralisation/fees/blocks and how much those play a role in the security of Bitcoin. However just because a majority has one view doesn't' mean the other side is completely false.
I just don't think the world is so black and white, and you can say XYZ has positive aspects while still not endorsing or agreeing with XYZ as a whole.
Moreover, to outsiders or people who are new to Bitcoin - they may see this as petty internal drama.
EDIT: And I say this as someone who believes that Bitcoin should have multiple websites even if the owner is a "trusted public figure" - because whether you call it a "community" website or not, a single entity still controls the server, domain name and/or has admin access.
It is perhaps preferable if Bitcoin.org and btcinformation.org co-exist peacefully without these dirty smear campaigns on "who is the most official Bitcoin site". Otherwise where do we draw the line? Previously it was simple, the .com site was the undesirable and it's unfair to just lump Bitcoin.org with Ver's site.

Always DYOR and double-check what apps you're downloading. This is one of many sneaky apps that try to look legitimate and then fraudulently take money from unsuspecting users.
I tried to report them but I can't find any "report" button on the Apple store, however that may be because I don't have any iOS-compatible products or accounts.

I'll be stuffed. Cryptopia have a terrible reputation spanning across multiple communities. They're all sizzle and no steak.
Their support is shonky and unprofessional, they'll delist a coin because someone made them mad and start carrying on like a pork chop. And they've had issues with multiple projects' communities like TenX, Embercoin, Safex, Pirl etc. especially with smaller communities. Someone should tell them they ain't there to root spiders but they're as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike.
Not sure if Hex finally went walkabout because he had a few roos loose in the top paddock.
However they list dozens of shitcoins that have dead github repos because that's as essential as a dead horse on a snag apparently.
Many users were devo with missing funds, transactions pending for months, wallets under maintenance for weeks, withdrawal fees that cost big bikkies, locked wallets, no support in months etc. Granted all exchanges suffer from these problems but it's a bad sign when a smaller exchange has more complains than bigger exchanges. London to a brick! But let's give them the fair shake of the sauce bottle...
Then they couldn't handle the previous major influx of new users which was chockers, and being busier than a one-armed paper boy with crabs, they kept taking in new users thinking it's hunky dorey until...crikey! It was a dogs breakfast and they were busier than cats burying shit.
Their interface and UI weren't just horrible but always laggy as hell and it was bug city in there.
There are many bodgy exchanges out there so if you're looking at Cryptopia I'd probably shoot through.
Sorry to spit the dummy, but they aint ridgey-didge.
@_date: 2018-08-06 03:14:34
Thank you for the nicely written article.
I'm not too knowledgeable on this subject, however after reading this I'm still a fan of "Hardware Specialization Resistance" although I would be interested in seeing a reply from projects or people that support it like XMR, VTC etc (tbh I don't know many projects that do this).
Although its possible for a company like Bitmain or another large manufacturer to make an ASIC miner on the sly for a project with Hardware Specialization Resistance, if they hard-fork often and do it in a way that changes just enough to break the current ASICs and make it hard to rebuild, but not enough to break other existing infrastructure on the blockchain, it might be worth it.
The problem I have with ASICs is that not many people can afford them and there are not many manufacturers selling them at reasonable prices to the public, the stock is always limited and coming from China, whereas any average joe can buy a GPU.
Even then, ASICs wouldn't need to be "resisted" forever, but you could try to resist it until it becomes a mainstream product like say in 10-15 years.
And regarding consensus, I think it's very heard to establish consensus in the first place - especially if you're going by social media. Many accounts can be bought and sold, you'll never know who is gaming the system and who is real apart from a few active users or public figureheads. The only exception is an extremely overwhelming majority which is what Bitcoin aims for (I think?).
However the consensus argument for constantly hard-forking isn't a big deal anyway, because the people buying into those projects are also buying into the idea/plan that they'll hard-fork whenever they think an ASIC is mining or whenever they want. Now, if Bitcoin were to do this, I can understand the argument here because it wasn't part of the plan.
There are also many "hybrid" algorithms can can cycle between Hardware Specialization Resistance, ASIC-acceptable and other forms like PoS or CPU mining etc. I'm quite interested to see how those hybrid algorithms fare against the standard ones.

It's a shame merchants aren't using those providers instead of BitPay.
However it won't be like that forever, once more competition starts coming in and users demand a better experience and report their issues with BitPay to merchants, we might see a shift.
BitPay is only used because it's the most popular with lots of integrations and easy for merchants to implement with fiat. People new to Bitcoin aren't going to use something like BTCPay, even though it's likely the best, but I'd be happy even just to see something like CoinGate or Globee overtake the leader.

We don't know who Satoshi is today or his views, a whitepaper he wrote a decade ago likely isn't going to parrot his opinions today on everything.
Hell, I don't even agree with my political views 10 years ago.
Even if I am wrong, although we owe Satoshi our thanks as creator, he is not the controller or president of Bitcoin.
There are and will be ideas in the future that improve upon his and potential issues that he did not foresee. No one has the authority to say "X is Satoshi's Vision" because no-one knows.

Real estate is fine but it depends on your geographic location and if you're actually investing in a property or investing via real estate investment trusts (REITs).
If it's the former, then most young people have no chance of investing in real estate as it requires lots of time and has a high barrier to entry. If it's the latter, it makes more sense.
@_date: 2019-08-12 09:37:54
Investing in stocks is financially more prudent than merely investing in Bitcoin or crypto.
Depending on your financial situation, investment horizon and risk level, the average young person should be aiming for 80% stocks, 10% bonds, 5% cash and 5% crypto and/or metals.

If anyone is familiar with Warren Buffet, you would know that Warren doesn't invest in anything he doesn't understand.
I believe he should just keep quiet about it instead of attacking things he doesn't understand, but if you get past the inane statements, his underlying arguments and reasoning makes sense.
I'm a big fan of Buffet and his idol Benjamin Graham - and while I disagree with him here, I can understand why he's no friend of crypto - and that's okay. Because I owe part of my financial skills and investment knowledge to him, among others.

Last time I checked bitcoin cash has way smaller fees than bitcoin core.
In fact im sure all coins have cheaper fees than bitcoin by now which means less people buying bitcoin to transact and as other coins grow more people will start using ether, fiat or litecoin etc instead of bitcoin to buy ALTs..although im pleased with the origins and gains of bitcoin, I really am not that optimistic regarding its future compared to other projects.

I'm one of those techno libertarian Austrian believers however this post is even garbage to me. I'm majoring in Finance and Economics, but no expert and deflation and inflation both have good and bad points. To cheer for one over the other is childish since you don't want either extreme. This is why Central banks aim for a small inflation target like 2%p.a. Depending on the economy. It's small, yet stable growth to stimulate the economy such as spending and investments.
Without investments nothing would happen. The likelihood of people investing decreases if the value of their currency was going to be worth more in the future due to deflation because it adds an extra step of analysing the ROI on an investment compared to not just inflation any more, but the future value of that currency which can be difficult in markets faced with lots of uncertainty which is highest at extreme rates of inflation or deflation.

You're right that it's mostly subjective, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Hello r/Bitcoin, I'm one of the mods at r/CryptoCurrency and I was the one that added the "Mod-Approved" flair and I want to explain what happened.
We currently use a bot that makes sure each coin has no more than 2 posts on the front page. This isn't always perfect and we re-approve content manually if we feel it adds new information or is a different topic to the others.
The OP of that post PM'ed me to re-approve, however to re-approve it I have to change the flair to "Mod-Approved" or "Development" so that the bot ignores it.
I firstly tried "Development" flair because we prefer that one, however that didn't work for some reason so I changed it to "Mod-Approved" which finally stopped the bot from constantly removing it.
I personally don't like the "Mod-Approved" flair because it sounds like we're endorsing that type of content, in reality the context means "we just approved this post so the bot doesn't take it down".
Now it has been corrected with the "Development" flair and we'll try not to use the "Mod-Approved" flair any more.

Of course if Bitcoin fails, confidence in the market will wither but that doesn't mean cryptocurrency will die forever.

This type of meme is exactly why many don't take crypto seriously.
Deflation and inflation both have positive and negative effects, but good luck convincing the developed world to abandon their 2% inflation targets used to stimulate an economy.

Didn't he just say that BCH has some good points? I mean I'm not a fan of it but I think it's okay to say something has it's pros and cons.
But in the end I don't think this stuff matters too much.

Yeah because calling everything a "shitcoin" will totally not alienate customers /s

People are saying stuff like that but I haven't seen him say anything that would imply that.

And what's not to say Bitcoin will be overtaken in the far future?
That user is only referring to emission rates and since then we've seen lots of new technologies and applications for different currencies. It is ignorant to assume Bitcoin will be the only dominant coin in the future and I wouldn't be surprised if that users opinion has evolved.

There's nothing to lose by accepting other coins though.

I like their support for crypto and their ideals in free-speech, but their Tweets are bs, their psy-op conspiracies are complete unsubstantiated drivel that is expected from the Russian trolls that flock to their platform to spread propaganda and division.
