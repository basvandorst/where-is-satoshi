How do you even pay for it? I thought a bucket would worth less than a transaction fee.

This sounds like a huge bomb. Hope it won't become the next MtGox.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:57:03
It certainly will. China has almost 70% bitcoin hashrates. Time to by some pre-owned mining rigs from China?( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

In all those countries which banned Bitcoin exchanges without approval of the majority people, the decision maker or makers will be prosecuted in the future.

Wow dude it looks like months of dedication. Did you work full-time for this?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:10:28
Huge thanks my friend. I just generated a BIP-39 seed, imported it to the electrum wallet and issued my first SegWit transaction from Bitstamp.
It just got confirmed few mins ago. It feels good to be one of the guys that embrace the new tech:)
Thank you so much for your help and your time again!

This isfor testnet only? I though we already have ln on mainnet?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:12:03
Also, there is a 250 coins sell wall at 16530 on bitstamp. Looks like some major players are cashing out?

What happens if you are buying at the middle of a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:29:37
Binance, poloniex. No need to be so triggered my friends, competition is what makes the cryptocurrency market improve and innovate.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:59:21
Glad to see that bcash spit out some value it stole from bitcoin during the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:13:31
Goodp point. I never tell anyone I know that I invested in crypto, cause I know what's their reaction: are you out of your mind?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:06:14
Love the story, but I think Mr satoshi does not look like someone who would die from starvation.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:30:56
Thanks, I've figured out how to generate p2sh addresses on electrum.

The 2nd stage of grief: anger.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:10:47
No, the rest of us are honey bagers. We eat anything and don't give a fk. You dead.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:27:21
Just look on any blockchain explorer, you can easily see how coins and hashpowers are centralized in bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:31:03
This doesn't justify for anything really. BTC/KRW has been 30% higher for over a mouth. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:55:32
Can a miner underpay transaction fees? Or he can only underpay block rewards?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:01:10
Sorry I confused the 2nd and the 3rd. So they are even a little behind than I thought.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:59:50
Well playing cryptokitties is fun though.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:13:34
It seems unlikely. Bitstamp disagrees with all user activated hard forks. If you want to claim fork coins, the better strategy is to keep your coins in a private key exportable wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:32:20
For the record, no one expected cryptocoin exchanges would be totally banned in China before September. I always have the worst expectations for news like this.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:58:58
Or maybe even worse, they spent them on lambos...

Hello my friends, SegWit tech support needed here!
I want to withdraw some bitcoins from Bitstamp (which is SegWit supported) to my wallet. I generated a SegWit wallet using the latest electrum, but much to my surprise, all the addresses generated start with bc1, and Bitstamp recognizes these addresses as invalid addresses. According to my understanding a SegWit address should start with a 3. May you guys please tell me what went wrong?
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:34:28
The real question should be why not crash.
