"That is right,  grandma, just RBF and doublespend with fee-adjustment after you resync your node. Otherwise just open a new LN channel. Silly grandma."

Lol what a noob. I bet you buy things from the grocery store with your noob visa card with noob confirmation times in less than 0.2 seconds and noob transaction costs of less than 0.5 percent.

We need more of this type of discussion. The usual tribalism helps nobody. Great essay.

Classic scammer response ;)
As I said - I don't think you are a scam - I just know nothing about you guys. In the post 2 above the one you responded to, I just tried to outline my understanding of the rational reasons why a mining group would give out contracts with regard to offloading risk (and reward!) onto the purchaser and away from the miner in order to guarantee profits. This is something that has been done for literally hundreds of years in various industries (particularly shipping and mining) and is not in itself a bad thing at all. The last line was more of a disclaimer as I am  clueless on the crypto mining contract space not in a position to endorse or condemn you at all. I am sure you are lovely people though :D

Yes. See my last line. That said, I know nothing about Genesis Mining and whether they are scam or not.
Edit: clarification - I meant 'yes' to the fact that scams exist, not that Genesis are scammers. See below.

Monero has RingCT and stealth addresses, giving cryptographic obfuscation of from/to address and amount. This is a non-transparent blockchain.

You can't have an honest concensus if you ban people for talking about the various options. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 12:19:13
Well, no. The idea is that you carry the risk of currency depreciation and give them a guaranteed profit. At least that is how it is meant to work.
Imagine the following:
You purchase 1000 BTC worth of mining crap and make a farm. You need to make a return to pay off your creditors. A loss is unacceptable. You are god-tier sysadmin, so the only risk of loss is if the price of BTC tanks. 
You therefore sell mining contracts at the current BTC/USD rate. This means that regardless of what happens, you will make a predictable return. If BTC moons, then you make less than you could have, and the contract holder profits. If BTC tanks, then you make more than you would have, and the contract holder loses. Either way, you make the same, and the contract holder holds all the risk. 
Basically, you are engaging the contract holder in a futures contract. 
Again - this is how it is supposed to work. In reality, scams abound. Tread carefully :)

Wow. Cypherpunk has changed since I was a wee lad.

He wants to sell 100 btc not 1000. Getting 100,000 usd out of the US is quite possible. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:06:55
Easy. Fly to US or Europe. Localbitcoins. Done.
Unless you are full of shit, in which case just scam someone here.

Serious question - what makes it an altcoin and not a different future for btc than core?
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:55:17
Jankiness is certainly the yardstick to which I judge my exchanges.
@_date: 2017-01-20 14:43:46
This is just schoolyard bullying. Why do you feel the need to act this way?
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:06:07
So where is the line? Is posting fluffypony's name doxxing? Clearly not. So why is this? Both have publicly posted their real name. Serious question, please reply.
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:07:09
Theymos had his real name on his website though. Is that really doxxing?
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:49:34
This looks like a photoshoop, but either way - I do not understand how a FMCG retailer can trade in BTC at the moment. The confirmation times and transaction prices do not make sense.
Layer 2 will allow this, if something trustless ever gets off the ground.

I am out of the loop. How is Bitcoin Cash any more an attack than the hundreds of other altcoin forked from bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:34:40
At present, Bitcoin is not fungible. It does not matter if there is a blacklist or not, from this perspective.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:57:14
If you look at the other bitcoin subreddit, they seem to believe that the reverse is true though. I have literally no skin in the non-altcoin game, but their view is that BCC was the original vision (whatever that means) while BTC is a Blockstream hostile takeover of the coin.

What is Bob's disincentive to not *always* do step 4?
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:56:38
Great writeup!
A good next topic might be 'what is actually *in* a block?'
What is the datastructure, how does the hash fit in, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:42:50
...and maybe Bitcoin is Netscape.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:36:33
Is it open source?
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:56:08
Lol, no. USA has a high GDP/capita, but definitely not the highest...
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:52:50
...is this for real?
