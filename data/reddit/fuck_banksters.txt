seizing fiat doesn't need force, they just take it if it's cash or send a letter to the bankster. With bitcoins is totally different, they REALLY need force or threatening by force the owner of the BTC to be able to enter in possession. If the owner of BTC rezist, they just suck it, badly, they get SHIT!    
All these news articles about "seizing" BTC are just a part of huge manipulation of masses to give the idea that Bitcoin can be seized as usual other fiat money. **It is not**.

Yes, you miss this:  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

I receive my income only in BTC for many years now. I really don't care about up/downs, because I switched my mind from fiat to BTC. Only speculators are looking into volatility. I live on BTC so what I earn today, I spend next month or year. I really don't care about today's price because BTC is securing my future not my next coffee buy of the next morning.  
People should look to the big big picture and zoom out the price graph.  
BTW my first buy of BTC was when it was $30... every week buying 1BTC :)

Nope. First educate more people about WHY they have to use BTC, how the actual financial system is a lie and slavery and then they will get BTC.  
Every person that you will try to sell BTC as "an investment"· will end up in losing money and faith and they will never understand WHY Bitcoin exist.  
Just look at this sub. From 800k readers, 80% are asking here only about when we get to the moon, lambos, market price speculations etc... and Bitcoin is NOT about this.  
Let me put it in a simple way: let's say BTC is like fire, when the first cavemen discover it.  
Some humans, ignore it (still) and continue to eat shit. some will use it just to scare other animals.  
But some will just use it to have amazing food, cooked and delicious. And also make many other good things with it.

Then stick with fiat, why bother taking BTC if you want to dump them immediately (**the most stupid idea**)?  
I really do not understand the point of this. You take the most advanced and valuable currency and you dump it for worthless goat shit fiat... you have to be a real idiot to do that. Use the fucking BTC to pay your employees, suppliers, save it, HODL it but never dump it for fiat!  
Close the circle! Use your bitcoins, put them back into circulation, make them stronger. Otherwise just stick with fiat and be the slave of your masters...

I am questioning the article for presenting "the seizing of Bitcoin" as an usual practice of the Police and is not true. Seizing some computers that have a wallet, doesn't mean the police seized the BTC.

I have no regrets/remorse for those idiots. During my long Bitcoin journey (from 2012) I told to a lot of people to buy BTC, just small amounts, for fun, for curiosity or whatever they want. And they laugh at me. I have no respect for those you told them to get some now and they didn't listen you, but they come back to you crying because the price now is skyrocketing.  
I don't give a shit about all those idiots/naysayers/ignorants, I just buy all the time from 2012, every month/week, no matter the price it is, everytime I had some spare cash.  
Bitcoin is NOT a communist way of redistribution of wealth! It is pure capitalist way. You have it or not. You are a loser or a winner. That's it.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:53:07
Bitcoin is changing the world as we know it, including police investigation/evidence.  
Having news article saying that BS with no proof is just a fucking lie with the purpose of misleading people into thinking that police can take/seize whatever BTC wallet.  


Again, it is not possible without wallet owner consent. If there was a consent that is not seizing anymore, is a give away. If it was due to intensive torture, that is not seizing anymore, it is theft at gunpoint.

@_date: 2018-05-21 16:15:57
Is not about the story or why police raided the guy. Is about how exactly they took the BTC.   
Scenarios:  
1 - police found a computer/mobile with the wallet open/not protected - highly doubted that a guy holding 1000 BTC will leave like that  
2 - police raid the house, found the wallet, locked and they force the guy to open it - guy is just stupid or doesn't know how to protect his rights  
3 - police planted a malware in his computer and already have his keys/passwords - guy is again stupid and also illegal for the police
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:01:05
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

Everything?!  
The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

You can't educate them just by selling them BTC. That's not the core issue here. I am sure that 90% of all those who will buy BTC from your "brokerage" system, really don't know, never hear, don't care about what fractional reserve really is and who really control the banks...  
The fire analogy really make sense (and again this is a proof that you do not understand what Bitcoin stands for) because if you do not teach others how to MAKE fire, you will never have a good chef :)  
BTW, Satoshi is like Prometeus: he stole the fire (Bitcoin - the power of creating/controlling money) from the gods (banksters) and give it to the people.

Solutions? Many  
You should really take in consideration this:  
  
  


Why do they accept BTC in the first place if they already dump it for the worthless goat shit fiat? Use the BTC received to pay your employees, suppliers or just hold it for you as a fund reserve.  
Dumping BTC immediatelly after you take it, is the most stupid idea. Is like those guys that now are crazy to buy at 9k but in 2010 when somebody told them to buy they just laugh...  
As a merchant is the best way to get some BTC when you accept them as payment. You don't need to register in an exchange, you just take them. Satoshi exactly for this created Bitcoin. Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**   
When you get some BTC, no matter at what price, always have in mind this funny video:  - which guy you want to be? the one in the car or the one outside the car?
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:53:11
I do not trust anything that I can't control the keys... a paper with embedded chip can be easily faked and/or I can't verify anytime the amount hold by that chip and /or if somebody else have those keys.  
This idea of BTC "cash" notes doesn't work well and will end up in scams and people lost funds.  
I trust only my wallets, my keys, my bitcoins.  
This mentality of pushing Bitcoin to be used/integrated into existing systems of money will never work. Bitcoin is here to disrupt and change all the systems as we know them, like never happen before in the entire human history.  
People should try to adapt to Bitcoin way not trying to adapt Bitcoin to existing ways...
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:43:41
Never ask somebody else for a "favorite" wallet. It's useless.  
Each wallet has his own features, functionalities that can fit each person needs. Each person should try as many as they can and dedicate each wallet for a specific use.  
There is also the option to use a wallet into 2 apps (mobile*/desktop or mobile/mobile, desktop/desktop). Having stuck your coins into a single wallet is dumb.  
Me personally I use at least 4 on mobile and 3 on desktop. And many hardware wallets.  
I am the bankster now, with my own money so I act accordingly.  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

I just use Bitwage and convert ALL my income into BTC, not only change...

I do not need another app that tracks and monitor all my purchases, bank accounts, cards, BTC wallets, habits... and later will find out that all that data went to "3rd parties"...

They just used Ross as a patsy and the whole story was well designed and directed to be used as an example in media. I don't buy it at all, foe me is a total lie. That's why they keep Ross for life in prison, so he can't speak freely about what is all about.

Hacked - It's SHA256 encryption, please try it.  
Stolen - If you have a computer/mobile infected with a keylogger, that doesn't mean the wallet was "hacked", it is your device hacked and the perpetrator stole your BTC without hacking your wallet.  
Seized - this term is incompatible with Bitcoin. Seizing mean de-possession of a property without owner consent. If the owner give the BTC keys that is give away, is not seizing anymore.

There are already in place:   
A Bitcoin "bill" (paper) is not trusted because you will never be sure that the private key on that paper wasn't compromised.  
Your whole idea goes back to fiat money, but without trust in a central authority, so it is from the beginning a bad idea.

I really do not understand how that people can't find places that accept BTC. I am using BTC from 2012 and I spend a lot in BTC too, directly to merchants.  
People also should start making this happen: talk to your neighbors, educate them, the future depends on this not by some kind of big retailer announcing their BTC acceptance. Small merchants move the wheel.

Going blindly into Bitcoin is a stupid ignorance. If you are too lazy to educate yourself why did you get into this ? Bitcoin is a financial instrument, powerful and disruptive and yet people do not educate well about it. This is unbelievable!  
There are tons of information out there. From 2012 until now I read everything I can to educate as much as I can about Bitcoin. There is so much good information that every day is a new day for me.

If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Same wallet you could use it in Electrum desktop app for more management of addresses, txs, better accounting etc.

They only said that they seized the 80 BTC but not also how or showing any proof they are in REAL possession of them. Seizing just a computer or an USB stick containing a wallet, doesn't mean a real SEIZE of the wallet.  
The real owner can still have full control of the keys from another device and they really SUCK IT, they seized NOTHING!

Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:  
  
  
   
  
  
You should really take in consideration this:  
  
  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

1. Activate stealth mode for Samourai wallet. Leave just another dummy wallet with few satoshis on it.  
2. Leave your Ledger at home, put your seed hidden into a nice text message/email/online post (so you can recover it anytime, anywhere).  
3. Memorize a backup wallet seed into your brain. [Optional you can even use steganography to hide your seed into a nice picture with cats.](

I don't see it as a competitor. I use both of them with the same segwit wallet. Each one has his own use and features and is backing up one of the other. You lost your phone, you still have your wallet in electrum desktop or vice versa.  
I use Samourai on mobile on stealth mode. It is a great feature.  
I would like to see a new feature to manage more than 1 wallet, like in Electrum mobile.  
Let's be clear, there is no "best wallet", each one is having his own features to serve better each user.  
It is not recommended to keep all your BTC in just 1 wallet, because is "the best". No, spread your coins and use each wallet for a dedicated type of txs.  
I am a heavy user of all wallets from 2012, I used almost all of them. Except online/custodial wallets, sorry those are NOT wallets, are black holes for your BTC...

If you have something to "sell", you have your own node, you don't need to do anything than publish your node ID and your customers can just open channels with your node. Once they do that, you can send them your invoice for receiving funds.  
Another "scenario" is when you don't have your own node, you just have a LN wallet. Then you have to open a channel or many with other nodes, then "make some space" on your channels by spending some satoshis on things, to buy/play/read.  
If you still do not want to spend, then you can send from one of your open channels the funds to zigzag.io exchange and withdraw to your onchain wallet, making in this way "space" for receiving funds on your empty channel. But be aware, ZigZag exchange can have situations when they do not have enough funds or channels to fulfill your withdrawal. That can have create problems sometimes. Be patient and/or contact them.

They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](

All this happen because merchants **are not well educated** into how to build a good system for BTC payments. They are fooled into other 3rd party intermediaries, with systems that sucks.  
There are ways to implement good BTC payment solutions but merchants simply ignore them because they simply ignore the first rule of Bitcoin: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Once they will truly understand this definition, then they will have a wonderful system.  
So instead of complaining, start doing something: EDUCATE merchants near you, friends, neighbors. Start with this definition and let them ask more questions. When people really understand what really is Bitcoin, then the rest is just coming easier.  
Complaining is not the way should move things forward.

Oh no, not another shopify shop accepting BTC. Seems that Bitpay/Conbase are launching their shills every day now.  
**Warning:**  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

Your tutorial about BTC security is worng: Bitcoin is NOT an investment. [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
THIS is the first lesson that people should learn.

**It is strongly recommended NOT to use Bitpay** You should use just your OWN wallet. There is no need for any intermediary to take BTC, that why was created in the first place.

2. To check a tx from/to your hw wallet, you don't need to run a full node. Just go to any blockchain explorer page and check your addresses/txs id.

I was using Bisq from the beginning, in 2016 (Bitsquare).  
You will have to keep open your Bisq client, until your order partner will confirm your bank transfer.  
If you had a partner out of SEPA bank network, it will take more than 48h to be confirmed by his bank + the time until the partner will really confirm your payment into Bisq.  
Don't worry, the mediator will interact when really it happen something. Until then the escrow is safe.

Do you remember this warning ? It was posted so many times here... ah you ignore it, right...  and now you came back here to complain. Pathetic. 
The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](

BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

- I designed this "nice" web wallet that tracks all your txs and steal your seeds, please use it, it's the most safe wallet ever existed!  
I am tired of all these BULLSHIT apps. What Bitcoin needs is EDUCATION!

If not, then use your regular fiat payments and keep this at the lowest volume until 0.

That IBAN it's yours. Trastra is giving you your own IBAN account, a visa card and a BTC wallet.  
so let's say you want to convert some parts of your salary each month in BTC.  
1. Tell to your employer to send your salary to your IBAN account (Trastra), as usual.  
2. You receive the fiat, and from your account, just click buy BTC, instant. The price, yes, is NOT like usual exchanges, it's quite a big difference, plus a 1% fee.  
3. You can convert all your salary or just a part. The other part you can just use a normal visa card. That visa card I think can be also loaded from your BTC wallet.  
4. I suggest wit withdraw your BTC from that wallet. You know, not your keys, not your BTC...  
5. This can be useful to pay some bills too. Let's say you buy BTC with all your fiat. You withdraw some into your personal wallet and some you just leave them into your Trastra wallet, for later spend. When you have to pay a bill, just convert some BTC and pay that bill. In this way you always keep all your money into BTC.
Overall, for those who do not want to deal with exchanges, this is a simple way to get into BTC. Yes, Trastra fees overall are not cheap. But each one can make his own calculations.  
There is also Bitwage.com, that do almost the same, only that you do not have your own IBAN and can't make fiat payments from that account.

Yes, is good, but some merchants, I don't know why, they simply stop accepting BTC after they post there. At least they can remove it. I use coinmap quite often, also with the mobile app](  ) 


If the announcement is fair, not aggressive and not heavily shilling, not repetitive it's OK and welcomed. Bitcoiners love to see more merchants accepting BTC. I don't know why you said that on reddit bitcoiners disrespect announcements. Maybe you refer to "buttcoiners" and trolls but not real bitcoiners. Yes if you post the same announcement every day, then is considered spam. That's the thing with reddit, is not a platform for promoting businisses. For that there are paid banners on top of each sub. You could pay and have your business promoted every day and nobody will disrespect your announcement.  


Me personally I se every day BTC paying to merchants. I stopped using fiat long time ago. So for me each merchant that start accepting BTC is an opportunity. Of course there are limits. Not all merchant are playing fair. and that could be penalized.

Nope, a bank can't "protect" you from robbery. If you tell them you keep your BTC keys into a bank , will kill you anyway.  
Better approach to this case is to keep always a "bait wallet" with just some fee satoshis on it. The rest can just sit on a HW wallet at home or in many different places stored, or just use steganography, or just use Samourai wallet in stealth mode.  
Today you have so many ways to hide your BTC that you have to be a REAL IDIOT not to do it and gibe your keys to a bank...

I am in Bitcoinlandia from 2012 and I learn a lesson: if you forget the bad actors, you get rekt. If you ignore them, others will get rekt. So better warn as much as you can about the bad ones. No remorse.  
In Bitcoinlandia we don't need "regulators" and "law makers", we deal directly with the junk.

Adopting Bitcoin a payment solution for your business is not an insignificant step. It is a big decision and should be evaluated on all possible ways and solutions. Just jumping in and using the first "solution" you find by "googling" is not the right way for any payment solution.  
I am welcoming more than enough all merchants that adopt Bitcoin payments, **because I live ONLY with Bitcoin for many years**. So I help them getting Bitcoin with every spend I made, almost every day for years.  
But also more than this, my privacy is very important. That's why I warn any merchant: do not use any 3rd party intermediary if you really want BTC. Bitcoin wasn't meant to be used like that and by using any 3rd party intermediary you violate the Bitcoin definition itself. Doesn't make any sense to use it anymore. You have fiat for that.

few days ago I saw an US citizen trying to pay with his CC in a grocery I use to pay with BTC, a product that cost like 2€. The cashier, look at him, then look at me (in the line), then look at his card again.  
Finally, he said to the US guy: hey look at this. And he bring his phone out, showing me his BTC QR code, I paid my groceries with BTC and done. He said to the US guy: this is money not that card so please come back with cash or BTC.  
US people mentality is too stick with those fucking cards, that's why they will be rekt over and over...

Then why bother taking BTC? Stick with the worthless goat shit fiat.  
There is nothing wrong to bill in EUR and take payment in BTC.  
A company with an accountant that is not capable to deal with BTC, should fired him....  
Bitcoin itself is the payment processor. There is NO need for any other intermediary.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now some "smart" people take that power and give it back to the banksters... smart move eh? I have to be really stupid to give away that power from my hands.

bisq is NOT for bigger amounts. You could try many orders but small amounts. I think it's even limited by design, exactly to keep out the scammers.  
In my opinion as a Bisq user from the beginning when they start as Bitsquare in 2016, they design it perfectly to be anti-scaming techniques.  
Bisq is just a p2p exchange NOT designed for trading, but just for simple people to be able to buy/sell their coins.

Yes we already know the bad intentions of DCG and their continuous attempts to hijack Bitcoin (see the latest S2X fork intention). We just make them useless.  
But, always when I see something saying (like in the end of this useless graph) "time to switch to another cryptocurrency" is a CLEAR message who is gonna be manipulated... and fooled again and again and again.  
Even if Blockstream as a company is compromised (bought) why we don't care? Because Blockstream is NOT the only participant in the Bitcoin code. So far all their devs shows us that they have a great vision and dedication to Bitcoin and not betray us as others in the past...  
So in the end I just consider this paint a stupid BS intent of manipulation.

is right on your own front page:   
How it Works - Accept Bitcoin Payments on Any Store
**Payouts in Euros, U.S. Dollars or Bitcoin**  
Step 1 - You are selling a product or service...  
Step 2 - We calculate how much bitcoins it is worth...  
Step -3 - Your Customer pays with bitcoins and Altcoins.  
Step 4 - **You receive 9.90€ (10€ - 1% processing fee).**  
There is no difference between Bitpay and Coingate. Just another paypal....

I wonder if "gab" was one of those defending Conbase when here there were many warnings about Conbase, saying that "they never have a problem, Conbase is just fine, the great exchange". Now that they are fucked and the warnings reach to their account they come here to cry like lamers....  
Please show me one of your posts against Conbase habits. This is NOT just from today. Conbase warnings were here for years.  
Remember this?  
The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

please read Bisq philosophy, will help
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:16:40
SEPA transfers to be reversed is a veeery difficult path and 99,9% is not possible. So it is a very very limited probability that you will get scammed.  
Regarding the deposit of BTC for the escrow, I think the Bisq wallet is BIP39 compatible so you could already use your recovery phrase for an older wallet (that you already have with BTC) as a Bisq wallet. I didn't try it yet but could be interesting to test this option.  


For what I know, for the moment only the developers are the mediators.  
Anyway is good that at least you had balls and try it. The experience is way different than centralized exchanges.

Nope. I will not do that. because if I would help you with that, you are a lost cause... We can't lose any "soldier"... even if is not well educated.  
So my advice is: PLEASE do not throw away your BTC. At least for now, few years. You will thank me later.

The exchanges part should be delimited and visible: centralized, decentralized, P2P, non-P2P so the dumb noob can make the difference before use.

If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Because you can't sustain a continuous 51% attack. Maybe for the 1-2 blocks but once the rest of the network participants will find you, you will be kicked out. So all your "investment" in attacking Bitcoin network will be worthless... and you will lose more money then if you would just mine it.

r/Coinbase or r/FuckCoinbase  
Or ask your "friend" that recommend you Conbase why you get rekt.  
The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more cases? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Conbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Conbase shit.

Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. We should NEVER forget that and keep that power for us and never give it back. It's the only way the human specie can evolve to something great.

For the first time in human history we have a way to keep for ourselves the money and the property, in the same time.  
Bitcoin is property and more than this has a key that only YOU can use it to prove that is your property. Once you give that key to somebody else, IT IS NOT YOUR property anymore.  
Try doing this with fiat and you can't.  
When people will truly understand this matter, then there will be more tools for them to use and keep easy all these keys.  
Banksters are fighting now to keep their role into money keeping because they know they will lose this game in the end. so they try all these sneaky tactics to fool people into believing that bank are the safest way to keep your money.  
Banks fooled humans very wise by promising them to keep their gold in their vaults. This time they can't fool us anymore. We know and we have the tools to keep our wealth by ourselves.

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Oh not again that BS "bubble" shit argument. Doesn't apply to Bitcoin. This is what people DO NOT WANT TO UNDERSTAND. Bitcoin is not about getting rich, is not about investment, is not about trading, is not about anything than taking the power of creating/controlling the money supply from the banksters and give it to the fucking people. The rest is just a game. The aspect of "bubble" is just a pathetic argument to distract people from real problems and what is really doing Bitcoin to the entire world.

Bitpay is not a bridge at all, is an enemy of Bitcoin.  
But why do you need a "bridge" to fiat? Just use BTC. You get some BTC? Pay your employees with them, pay your suppliers with BTC. They still do not want your BTC? Pay your bills with BTC, are many services doing that. Or just HODL them. But taking BTC only to dump them for fiat back is really stupid.  
I am paid in BTC by my employer, for many years now. After long time I tried to convince him to accept BTC and buy BTC as reserve currency. In the end he realized that BTC is the way to follow and now many of his employees are paid in BTC.

If BTC price goes to a low level around $10-$50 and big miners shut down their facilities, then lots of bitcoiners will start mining again at home with their CPU/GPU/USB rigs.  
Me personally I was mining in 2012-2013 like that and I would be more than happy to start again my old rigs.  
Why?  
Because mining is securing my txs, my bitcoins. Is not ONLY about profit.

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
If a merchant wants to take BTC, just open up a BTC wallet and take them. Bitcoin DOESN'T NEED any intermediary.  
If the merchant still want to accept fiat payments, just stick with traditional ways (antiquated) of fiat payment processors.

If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.

Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

nope. you save today for your tomorrow's necessity instead of borrowing today money that NOBODY have  them and be a forever slave in debt.  
Bitcoin will change the whole mentality of "being in debt = good", by "don't spend today = save it for tomorrow when you will need it more". Who HODL today is not keeping it to sell it later, is keeping his BTC to spend them later when everybody will accept it. Because in those days, NOBODY will accept anymore fiat.

Don't complain that there is low volume... be the volume. Each user is a part of the volume.  
Bisq wasn't meant to be a large exchange, only for trading and speculation maneuvers. Bisq is meant to be just a P2P decentralized way to get some BTC.  
In a centralized non-P2P exchange you will NEVER know that the volume is not fake, the orders are not fake, because you don't have that transparency like on Bisq. On Bisq you always know that any order is REAL by real person, that cannot manipulate the volume.  
Remember this?  Is real on centralized exchanges.

To answer your question, as a person that uses only BTC to buy stuff:  
- as a merchant - you never get charge backs, once you get the payment your money are YOUR money. Nobody can take them back or seize them.  
- as a shopper, you are sure that your money are going directly to the seller, instantly, your personal info will be exchanged only with that seller (if it is a serious merchant and not uses a 3rd party intermediary shit), privacy of your shopping and security if you use a p2p marketplace/system with an escrow. Also as a person that buys with BTC is about to **FUCK THE BANKSTERS** by not using their worthless goat shit fiat money, that puts you in debt forever.

That's not different than a robbery. I came to your shop, pay you the goods and once you put the money into your cashier, I will bring a gun to your head and say, now give me the money back...

You forget one important thing: **how much time you can sustain this 51% attack**. 1 block, 2 blocks as maximum? So what you will get? 25BTC in total? Because in the moment some guys will see your move, you will be kicked out. And lose all your attack money.  
All 51% attacks are useless in this moment. Good luck attacking the most robust financial system in the whole human history!

Pay directly with BTC. Plenty of merchants in Europe accepting it.  
If you still have fiat, and the merchant still doesn't take BTC, pay with fiat. HODL BTC.  
If the merchant accept BTC, then pay with BTC.  
This is the first rule of adoption.  
 or the mobile app  
  
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:44:47
1. Shopify. That means you accept BTC through a 3rd party intermediary as Bitpay, Conbase etc.   
2. Why the BTC logo is much smaller than Dash and LTC ? Suspicious.
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

If I would remain the only one person on Earth using BTC, even then will not be zero. So your assumption is not working, because I will never sell for fiat, just use &amp; HODL. Actually I closed all my bank accounts. And many will follow. 
So even if the banksters will sell their BTc on the market, we will buy them and use them as money. NO MORE FIAT! In the end we will win and the banksters will just remain with shitload of worthless goat shit fiat money.  
Is just a matter of time...
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:29:23
Just tell me: why are you using Bitcoin?   
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now you want to give back that power to the banksters. Is not that stupid?  
Did you ever studied history? How the today's banking was created back centuries ago? Exactly by the same scam: "give me your gold to keep it "safe" in my bank". They sold the gold for worthless papers 100x more then they get and when the people go to take their gold back they get a nice law by their gov that there is no right to keep gold, you have to use ONLY their worthless papers.  
How many times humans can be scammed with this cheap trick?  
Bitcoin is coming to kill forever this scam: not your keys, not your bitcoins. Ignore this golden rule and you will get rekt. **Remember this fucking rule!**

As much as I hate Conbase I have to admit that this is ONLY YOUR fault. You get scammed because you ignored all the warnings and security advice. Yes Conbase is bad, but in this case Conbase have nothing to do.  
this should be a lesson for many:  
- don't "invest" recklessly  
- don't keep your money in an exchange more than 1 second  
- don't trust ANY exchange  
- keep clean your computer that you are using for BTC exchange  
- use decentralized P2P exchanges (very low possibility/probability of scamming)
@_date: 2018-06-05 08:30:21
Nope. The more people are using Conbase, the more their privacy is fucked. Conbase is a fucking banskters tool to trace everybody that uses their system.  
Please, wake the fuck up and see the truth.  
Same reminder again:  
[Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Conbase is that fucking financial institution that will track, monitor, seize, share all your info and money with other "3rd parties". This is a long process of making a BTC user pattern, and linking all the BTC addresses they can, to control it in some way. And when all this plan is almost done, you will wake up that Bitcoin is no longer the freedom currency but a fucking fedcoin that you all these years tried to avoid. You will be trapped in their majestic plan.  
Keep Bitcoin private, is the only way to fight against the banksters!  
Bitcoin is NOT just another payment way, is your fucking ticket to freedom from the banksters.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:45:47
Paypal? Are you out of your mind?  
You are one of the luckiest persons on this planet, having some BTC and you want to give them away for the worthless goat shit fiat/paypal?  
You better use those BTC to buy stuff with them. Lots of merchants accept them now and are waiting you to spend on their products/services.  
Just take a look of this 1 example:  or   
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. We, the people, we have the duty now to continue his work, by using Bitcoin as money and not give that power back to the banksters.  
You should never forget the definition of Bitcoin: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

@_date: 2018-06-07 21:54:19
Simple.  
1. rename your wallet.dat file into wallet.da1  
2. Open the Bitcoin Core app and let it to create a new fresh wallet.dat file  
3. Rename this one too into wallet.da2  
4. Move/copy these 2 wallets files into a safe place, encrypt them.  
5. Stay using/syncing your Bitcoin Core all the time with a new 3rd wallet.dat file, leave it empty, no txs.  
6. Anytime you want to use one of those previous wallets, just rename the empty wallet.dat into wallet.da0 and the wallet.da1/da2 into .dat  
You will see that each dat file will have a slightly different size, depending on how many txs and addresses you have on it.  
The data folder of the Core app can be used for any of those .dat files, don't have to download for each the whole blockchain database.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

I have a grocery shop on my street run by a pakistani. Few years ago I convinced himn to take my BTc for my grocery shopping.  
For years now, he feed his whole family in Pakistan with my small shopping groceries cost.  
Just by that, he's giving me 10% discount all the time for all I buy and pay with BTC.  
He is more than happy for BTC.

If you live only with the money you get yesterday for today... that is not life anymore, is just slavery.  
People focused too much in the price will lose the big picture.  
I always use the BTC I get from 3-4 years ago, those from today I will use them in 5-6 years.  
My employer pays me directly in BTC. Both we don't care about the today's price. We care that in 2 years will be damn hard to get only some few satoshis... The company started to keep quite a lot of BTC as money reserves and from there also is paying some employees. Banks are not an option anymore for them.

I know that my answer sounds more harsh but this is the plain fucking truth: I never "give away", "donate", "tip" BTC to anybody. If they do not give or make something in exchange for my BTC, don't even think about it.  
I do not care if is for a good cause or salvation of humanity. My BTC are MY BTC.  
Why? Simple:  
1. My BTC are earned hard, for the past 8 years.  
2. Each one of my BTC means MY FREEDOM. Each time I would "give" (for nothing) to somebody I would give a part of my freedom. Freedom is very hard to earn nowadays. Who want it should work hard for it.  
3. Nowadays, BTC gets too valuable to be given for free. Those times when everybody were throwing around with BTC are GONE.  
4. All these "donations" pledges are mostly scams, begging for obscure sites, that absolutely nobody can track where the money goes or how they are used.  
5. If I really want to help a person in need I will do it directly and in private, not through any bloodsucker false "organization" or "foundation".  
6. Any of these cases for donations are in fact the result of fucking bad govs and banksters plans to decimate/enslave people. These should be the ones to pay for any disaster, crime, people in need, because they are the ones that created in the first place, not me. So please do not ask me to pay for other gov/bankster did!

No, they can do shit if everybody stop using Conbase and all other shit custodial services. Use your own BTC wallet, your own BTC node and fuck them!

I know that my answer sounds more harsh but this is the plain fucking truth: I never "give away", "donate", "tip" BTC to anybody. If they do not give or make something in exchange for my BTC, don't even think about it.  
I do not care if is for a good cause or salvation of humanity. My BTC are MY BTC.  
Why? Simple:  
1. My BTC are earned hard, for the past 8 years.  
2. Each one of my BTC means MY FREEDOM. Each time I would "give" (for nothing) to somebody I would give a part of my freedom. Freedom is very hard to earn nowadays. Who want it should work hard for it.  
3. Nowadays, BTC gets too valuable to be given for free. Those times when everybody were throwing around with BTC are GONE.  
4. All these "donations" pledges are mostly scams, begging for obscure sites, that absolutely nobody can track where the money goes or how they are used.  
5. If I really want to help a person in need I will do it directly and in private, not through any bloodsucker false "organization" or "foundation".  
6. Any of these cases for donations are in fact the result of fucking bad govs and banksters plans to decimate/enslave people. These should be the ones to pay for any disaster, crime, people in need, because they are the ones that created in the first place, not me. So please do not ask me to pay for other gov/bankster did!  
7. I never heard of how started this bullshit "giving tuesday" Is just a bullshit story to make people empathize and give away.  
Please stop all these begging!

Some. In general I use the "rule of 3": HODL (large), buffer (medium), LN/mobile (small)  


Much safer than using a bank.  


There's is no such thing. This is a propaganda launched by govs to keep away people not to use privacy features from wallets and instead using centralized shit wallets like Conbase. We use Wasabi and other coinjoin options not to avoid the so called "tainted coins" but to reclaim our privacy.  
Personally I don't give a shit about if a coin was used previously for buying drugs or kill somebody. It's money. When you take a $20 bill you do not ask the previous owner if he use it for selling drugs. You just take it.

Something did not add up here.
You said that 14 million USD were traded on LBTC meanwhile a normal wage is 3USD. That means almost 5 million people would convert their 3USD wage into BTC (**supposedly**)  
How many population have Venezuela? 31  millions roughly. That means only 6.2% of population uses LBTC to convert their ENTIRE wage into BTC (again supposedly). That's total bullshit.  
I think that those 14million USD were exchanged by the government officials not by normal people...

Even an old smartphone, kept offline can do exactly the same what is doing a HW.  
You could create the tx offline, sign it, on any wallet that support that feature. Then take the tx signed, paste it in a txt file that you can open it in whatever other wallet and broadcast it.  
You could send the txt through Bluetooth or Wifi share between 2 phones (one offline, one online).

The thing that it doesn't have LN support doesn't make it "outdated". Not everybody is using intensively LN.  
That wallet app is the oldest and the first mobile wallet app for Bitcoin, maintained by Bitcoin developers and is regularly updated. Yes it's simple interface, but is working perfect. BTW you can even connect to your own node (feature that very few mobile wallets have today).  
From the plethora of custodial wallets I would choose this one, because it is not custodial and is one of the most trusted apps.

Bitcoins that are not locked into a trade order, just "sitting" into user account are not affecting the price in any way.  
Anyway this movement should not be triggered in mass, is just a way to remind you that once you buy some BTC, withdraw them into your own wallet not leaving them into an exchange. In this way also thje exchanges cannot create a fractional reserve over users funds.

I know that my answer sounds more harsh but this is the plain fucking truth: I never "give away", "donate", "tip" BTC to anybody. If they do not give or make something in exchange for my BTC, don't even think about it.  
I do not care if is for a good cause or salvation of humanity. My BTC are MY BTC.  
Why? Simple:  
1. My BTC are earned hard, for the past 8 years.  
2. Each one of my BTC means MY FREEDOM. Each time I would "give" (for nothing) to somebody I would give a part of my freedom. Freedom is very hard to earn nowadays. Who want it should work hard for it.  
3. Nowadays, BTC gets too valuable to be given for free. Those times when everybody were throwing around with BTC are GONE.  
4. All these "donations" pledges are mostly scams, begging for obscure sites, that absolutely nobody can track where the money goes or how they are used.

Yes, is an important moment in Bitcoin history, but not a reason to cheer up. Is just an established moment, we all know what is it and what is doing. But will affect little the Bitcoin evolution.

Use Bitwage. No need to have a wage. But you could setup an automatic payment every month.  
You could even split as you like 80% goes to your regular bank fiat account, and 20% goes straight to your BTC wallet.
But if you already started a business the BEST WAY is to accept Bitcoin! But **do not use an intermediary for that**. Bitcoin itself is the payment processor. Keep all the BTC received as your 20%.  
It's a good start as you think.

You are getting it wrong.  
You shouldn't accept BTC just to exchange them back to fiat. Focusing on exchange rate is useless. Take them, hodl them and/or use them to pay employees or suppliers.  
You should never use and intermediary as "payment processor". Bitcoin itself IS the payment processor. That's why we use Bitcoin, to get rid of intermediaries and **fuck the banksters**.  
Patience and integrate LN on your website.

**THIS IS THE WAY BITCOIN SHOULD BE USED!**  
I have an idea: why not creating open source servers for merchants, RaspPi or NUC, and sell them directly, already configured, just add their own personal details.  
Also could be a fund pool where merchants can join together into having a common server and split the costs of hosting.  
Another idea: BTC Pay can have an app for NAS (Qnap or Synology), easy to implement and use?

[Here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
As exchanges, I would recommend only decentralized exchanges, the truly way to protect your privacy.  
One DEX that is ready and working great is  or   
Many other DEX [here](

Why this systemic desire to fit Bitcoin into existing systems (economic, social, politic, financial)?  
Instead people should look into designing new systems based on Bitcoin. Something that humanity never experienced. Something like ["Smart Citizen Platform"](  
Let's be clear: Bitcoin will change entirely this world, in every aspect (economic, social, financial, politic) of our society. Trying to fit Bitcoin into an antiquated, obsolete, centralized, tyrannic, corrupt system will NEVER work!

Conbase is a custodial wallet, as fuck. More than that they monitor, track and seize your money if they do not agree with on what you spend your money. Also any stash you keep or movement, they give that info to IRS/gov. Is worst than a bank!  
So watch out... **any custodial wallet is a trap,  a black hole for your money**.  
If you ever used a custodial wallet, is strongly recommended to shapeshift those coins.

With Bitwage you are not having more hassle with buying BTC. Every month all your income or % of it is converted automatically in BTC, straight to your wallet.  
When you receive your wage in fiat and wait to buy, you always hesitate the moment or buy less. With Bitwage, the employer just pay to you as usual, bank transfer, without even knowing that those money will be BTC in few min. You can setup also your acc to receive % in fiat and BTC, for example 30% to your bank acc linked to your bank card and 70% to your BTC wallet. All done instant.  
Bitwage is very good for those who work with companies abroad and need to pay you in local currencies. No more hassle to exchange and stuff, employers pay to a local bank, you receive wherever you are BTC and/or your local currency.

1. Use iancoleman offline or using a LiveCD OS (tails) and generate a BIP39 segwit wallet  
2. Write the seed on a piece of paper  
3. Save also some first 10 BTC addresses generated in a text file and the Xpub, just to have them to check your integrity of generation  
4. Open on your mobile Samourai wallet  
5. Use the generated seed (weith iancoleman) to recover your segwit wallet into Samourai  
6. Check if the receiving address/xpub is the same you saved into the txt file  
7. Optional you could use the same seed into Electrum desktop wallet to recover and use the SAME wallet. When you recover use the options BIP39 with derivation path 49.  
This is the way you use iancoleman and a mobile/desktop wallet.

You could embed a wallet passphrase into a nice picture file. Nobody can figure out that you hide a wallet there.  
Look into steganography.

Nope, Better, dump fiat, use Bitcoin. Problem solved.

You are your own bank, so if you want to lend, go ahead.  
But there is one aspect that people should take in consideration: Bitcoin will change TOTALLY the world as we know it, including lending.  
The biggest mistake many people are doing is that are trying to put Bitcoin to fit into the existing systems (economic, financial, social etc) and many times is not fitting well. Why? Because Bitcoin is not meant to fit into these antiquated, obsolete, tyrannical, anti-freedom, anti-human systems. Bitcoin is going to bring new systems, new ways of living for humans.  
Bitcoin will make people to save money, instead of borrowing to spend on stupid unnecessary things. Fiat money push you to borrow and spend on things you really don't need them.    
Yes, all of these maybe sounds crazy for some, but this is the truth! Bitcoin will change EVERYTHING in this fucking mad world!  
**It's time for changing this world!**

Few years ago I started also with small amounts.  
I used to drink a lot of beers. so I decided to drink less and those money to redirect them to buy BTC. Every week buying small amounts, no matter the price it is, buy &amp; HODL.  
Today, I have many BTC, just by doing that.

No need to trust people, trust the blockchain.  
There are already projects that can change this fucking mad world, like [Smart Citizen]( based on blockchain.  
I don't have to trust a politician to manage my money for common good.  
I am the one that decide what to do with my money, directly.  
I am the one that decide and pay with my money for the common good.  
I am the one that follow up, check and monitor my money to be used for the common good, with the blockchain.  
We don't need anymore corrupt politicians to "represent" and decide for us.  
We will be own politicians and managers of our money, because from now one each one of us will be own bank, with Bitcoin.

["Legality of Bitcoin"]( is meaningless.  
All these "reports" about which countries have "legalized" Bitcoin is a total BS crap, with the goal to brainwash people into the idea that Bitcoin CAN BE illegal in some way.  
Bitcoin CAN'T BE legal or illegal. Bitcoin just is and can't be stopped to be used or declared banned. It can't work.

No need. Just dump fiat and use only BTC. You take out their main power/weapon against you.
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:20:30
Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.  
  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
People usually ignore these warnings, but later they wake up fucked really hard by Conbase and is too late. They always they come with the excuse "Conbase is a rampup, necessary now for people to get in" or "it's easy to get some BTC", it's the same thinking about Facebook, that later they get fucked.  
People usually forget warnings like Andreas did it many times: [We will be attacked, all the time, in many ways]( and Conbase is the most dangerous attack, because is from within.
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:28:31
There are no real proofs for that assumption and even then, is their internal problem, let them kill each other, why I have to pay to bomb them? I don't care if they kill each other until remain nobody there. IT is not my problem!  
**My money will never be used to bomb/kill other people!**  
[And here you have one of the hundreds proofs that wasn't any chemical attack, all was a hoax to fool you to pay your fucking taxes](

@_date: 2018-04-21 18:06:10
Andreas is exactly like that cat on the wall. I think his main stash of BTC is on his Conbase account and for that he still walk on both sides...  
But I don't see his tweet as "defending"! Conbase. He just explained that Conbase is a bank and you should act accordingly. That's all.  
I am all against Conbase but let's not throw with shit all around because they are shit...

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.

BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets (as Conbase) = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

People are still too stupid and trust 3rd parties, EXACTLY what Bitcoin stand against for.
