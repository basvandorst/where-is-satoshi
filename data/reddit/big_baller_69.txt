Maybe it's time to buy some altcoins ��☕️

Does anyone know how to calculate average transaction fee and time?
Fees - bitinfocharts has an average fee chart:
I guess they just monitor transactions and calculate satoshis to usd, then average over the day.
Time - we can monitor block time, but transactions take much longer than blocktime due to unconfirmed transactions. How can we actively monitor tx time?

Whether it looks like a multi-currency wallet or there will be QR codes is details about execution, which we'll see in the coming months.

Can anyone explain how Lightning Network prevents double-spend? 
It seems to me that no one has mentioned how a transaction is confirmed. It's "off chain," so it's not mined, so who's checking the ledger? Lightning Labs?

Over the next year, 
1. BTC will get more attention in articles like this, that show the flaws on "pseudo-anonymity"
2. XMR tx fees will go down w/ bulletproofs (fingers crossed)
Combine both and darknet will take XMR more.

Andreas Antonopolous has claimed that going from BTC to LN will be like flipping a switch on your wallet. This makes sense sending FROM BTC to LN, but not the reverse. 
Following your answer, when you go from LN to BTC, LN will try to add it up and make sure you have the funds available...I guess? My question is...how? 
I'm not a blockchain expert, but from what I understand the blockchain exists as a ledger of all transactions. This is how at one time you can check ANY address and see how much is in it. Will this be the same for LN? Or will it just say...how many transactions you have open? 
Thank you for the thought out answer, by the way.

This is amazing

OK, then my next concern is, what benefit is there to making an on-chain transaction vs. off-chain? 
It seems if LN is so epic, why would I EVER go on-chain?

Why isn't it possible to send more? 
For example, A sends B 1 BTC. There is now a 1 BTC channel open. 
What's to prevent A from withdrawing 1 BTC from LN to BTC? What checks to make sure he actually has 1 BTC (even though he has zero)?

That sounds terrible. 
Cryptocurrency is supposed to be immutable. I spend, it's gone.

Additionally, relying on a mixing service/DEX induces a single point of failure. Shapeshift is forced to gives up reports of user IP's? Adios anonymity. 
Buy XMR.
