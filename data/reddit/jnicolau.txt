That happened to me, but support isn't working for me. After 7 days and 6 emails I didn't get any help. First I got just and automatic message. Then yesterday I reached to them over twitter and they decided to answer to one of my emails, asking me what's my email address (?). After that, no answer, no feedback, not even "we're trying to figure out", nothing.

Using bitcoins doesn't pump-up the price as much as holding them. The consumer gets bitcoins from the exchangers and right after that buys goods from merchants. Merchants receive the Bitcoins and immediately convert them back to euro/dollars.

Yes we should fight back but with the right instruments. It's not about fighting banks nor financial regulators. They are not accountable for the laws that are approved by our politicians. That's right. There is a very short ceiling about how far we can go without any support from politicians and laws that are written and approved by them.  We have now some technical solutions that allow people to vote directly on the proposals that are relevant for them, we can even bypass Parlement and make democracy a real thing. DemocracyOS, LiquidFeedback, VoteCoin, NetParty are just a couple of examples how technology can fix the system, on a very low budget, and give the power back to the crowds using Internet.
