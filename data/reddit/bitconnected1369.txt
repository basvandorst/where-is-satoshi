If he had the balls, he would have offered to eat his own dick if it wasn’t at 3.300
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:43:52
Head and shoulders. Sign of a reversal. Indicates price may fall if we can’t smash past 8500.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:40:38
Tether/bitfinex caused this. And now they have all our monies.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:32:24
Potential batman forming on the 2hr/4hr BTCUSD chart. Watch the price carefully over the next few hours.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:01:54
Buying the dip is a great way to average you purchase price downwards. It makes your bitcoins cheaper overall.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:17:00
Robust defence at 8000. I’ll eat my own dick for breakfast tomorrow morning if it’s less than 8k.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:51:02
Exactly. Shaking those weak, feeble loose hands out. They can ram their fiat cash up their ass...we don't need your fiat to raise the price of bitcoin. The belief in the technology alone will put the price of bitcoin to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:53:13
Battling 8.3k. Trying hard to keep the bears at bay...can’t hodl on much longer...send re-inforcements armed with buy orders. Call in an airstrike of green dildos soon.
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:29:24
Goodbye bitcorn. Don’t worry, I’m only temporarily aboandoning you for fiat. I’ll be back to buy many more of you at 99c. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:13:13
I read today that bitcoin can’t go negative. That way it will never make you owe money.
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:43:43
I’ve got someone on here -1ing all my posts. Whoever you are...I’ll find you...just like Jack Nicholson sniffing out the dirty rat in Departed.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:18:37
Anyone know why we always see the Sunday morning sell off? Happens like clockwork and I always kick myself for not selling on Saturday evening to increase my BTC on Sunday.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:35:26
I’m going to go insane if we are on our way down again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:27:07
Everyone was saying Bitcoin would be $100,000 by the end of 2018! :(
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:01:39
This is definitely the bottom or I’ll eat my own dick.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:50:57
Erm...because I want to own a lambo before I’m 60 years old and can’t get the pecker up for the babes that will be flocking to me.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:50:35
Unless his name is Mt. Gox. Then don’t give him money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:36:38
Rocket motor has stopped firing. Falling back to Earth. Eject.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:38:20
Yes, to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:41:03
You forgot to make your lines draw a rocketship and lambo on that graph. Otherwise, a great analytical effort. You seem to be a jedi master of chart analysis. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:55:02
I’m pretty sure the Winklevoss Twins just wiped the bird poo from their Lambos with my $15,000. :(
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:36:05
Someone is dicking around, manipulating the market??
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:04:38
A week in crypto is like a year in the real world.

When bitcoin touches 7500, my turtles head touches cloth.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:21:33
Pray to the good Lord and he will provideth lots of bitcoin. Allah is also a hodler, he will reward with 72 virgins and a gold plated Lambo. May many satoshis be upon you brother.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:11:37
I’m winning. More buy, more buy. I can push the bears back towards 9k.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:07:10
 Bitcorn can’t make its mind up what to do.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:35:30
Fell into the trap of wanting to own one whole bitcoin. I did that too. Didn’t realise you don’t actually get that coin that appears in all the news articles. :(
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:37:40
That 12hr doji star says we are going down.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:37:36
Is there a chance this could be bots, algos and whales giving it one last push at trying to steal our bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:46:25
I succesfully traded my BTC for less fiat than I bought it for.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:27:36
But then the egg gets fertilised and we get rich.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:33:12
And soon, all you’ll have left is two cents.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:56:20
All I see is green. Strap in guys and hodl tight. I’ve gassed our rocket ship with fiat and am firing the motors. Next stop driving our lambos on the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:22:04
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:51:11
Care to explain a bit more?
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:28:58
Half an hour until binance comes back people!!! I will crap my pants if this doesn’t happen.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:31:41
I’ve been holding it in all bear market for luck. Time to release and partaaay!
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:03:26
Bitcorn might bounce to 12.8 but then will probably fall to 9. This is indicated by the helmet formation it is currently drawing with a japs eye at the top. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:22:04
 Bitcorn is going to turn me into a slumdog millionaire.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:04:43
OK. I’ve just read about what the dot com bubble was and this sounds pretty similar. Badass. Wish I hadn’t invested at 17k. :(
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:00:15
Better quick question: when lambo?
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:12:48
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:02:17
I feel like plankton that’s been eaten up by a whale.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:55:57
This guy is a bell end.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:10:20
Bitconnected need Lambo. This is taking too long. :(
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:54:55
Anyone know why the market always goes crazy at about 2230GMT. Usually see a load of selling, price falling then rebound at about 2300GMT and stable?
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:26:11
Bitcorn giving me a limp dik today.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:04:46
You, Sir, sound like a nocoiner.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:20:00
I’m starting to suspect this years pattern looks nothing like the previous years and the Chinese holiday is nothing to do with it. :(
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:58:35
Thanks. That’s the kind of positivity I like. I’ve got 1BTC invested. If I get enough money for 3 lambos I’ll sell you one for 1 BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:37:57
Tether seems pretty solid. Hasn’t hardly moved since this dip. Looks like one to put your trust in.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:26:25
A retracement to a higher low on a high-timescale chart would give me a good feeling about this. Even though we are above the breakout level, we still need a close above this level. Until then, my Lambo order is still on hold.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:54:19
Still hold. I’m no quitter. I might lose my money but I won’t lose my dignity.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:17:01
I’m in it until I get my $15,000 back. This occurs when bitcoin hits 17k.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:20:49
What’s going on with this? Don’t fully understand?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:09:04
I’m a bit full actually, I already had to eat mine.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:00:56
It looks like we are close to completing the cock and balls line on the 4hr chart. Not a good sign. It will be a jizzbath on Monday.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:00:37
Guys...rest up good tonight. The battle for $10k resumes tomorrow and we all need strength. We may not have won the battle today but the war is is far from over. Have a good night sleep and we'll tool up with big green dildos tomorrow and batter those sell walls down. Happy Lambo dreams.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:40:40
I went over the top of the trenches at 10am. Been battling hard all day trying to get us all to 9k. I’ve axed a few bears today. Might have to retreat home for dinner soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:26:42
I’m wondering…under consumer law, will Coinbase give me a 28-day refund if I’ve managed to lose my money on Ripple?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:36:10
Why dont you want that Lambo before 80 years old? We need exponential growth to get that Lambo.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:14:46
Yep....looks like it. Volume is low too. Expect to see 6000 soon. :(
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:11:49
These guys have done donuts on the moon in matching Lambo. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:32:24
You are learning son. Do the opposite of what your brain tells you to do.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:42:21
I might have made a loss, but I discovered reddit and now consider all you guys my friends. Praise the Lord.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:11:11
Exactly. The whale need the plankton. Be safe everyone and enjoy the green dildos before the red ones come to stretch your butthole.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:32:54
I wish we could all just settle up and the guys that made money give back the profit to the guys that lost money. :(
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:23:48
I salute you Sir.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:20:28
Guys, please tell me, am I in a bull trap or am I rocketing to the moon?
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:09:49
Nah...8k resistance is massive. It’s an impregnable wall of buy buy buy. You couldn’t smash it down with an army of red dildos if you tried. Even with nuclear weaponised red dildos.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:37:19
I’m strapping myself in tight. I’ve just put 0.5 bitcoins fuel in and I know I’m heading to the moon via a stop at $20,000 first. See you in my Lambo this time next week.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:57:25
No, invested when bitcoin was $17k.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:51:27
And tether.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:49:23
I can sustain an erection again, I think we are on a bull run. This feature ceased working when the market was crashing.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:26:02
Me too. I bought the air freshener at the weekend. I’ve hung it up in my toilet ready.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:31:17
I bought bitcoin at about 17k on its way up. Am I worried? No. I believe in the technology and I believe believers will be rewarded handsomely. I bought it on my credit card through Coinbase and had planned the repayments would be paid out of bitcoin profits. First payment due in a couple of weeks and I believe we will start to rise up before then. If we don’t, I can always sell a little bit of the crypto to make the minimum payment.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:29:32
These bitcorn red dildos is really stretching my chocolate starfish.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:34:25
I’m so confident I’ll even throw in a teste.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:39:53
That better have been a typo and was meant to be $200k or you are Loose Hands Luke...couldn’t even eat 50 eggs.
 
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:43:44
That’s the way we do business in cryptoland. To the moooooonnnnn!
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:11:25
Yeah, but I was really panicked when we were at 6000 and sold everything. I just rebought at 8400 when it was going up again. :(
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:23:28
I keep dollar cost averaging at every dip. I bought in at $17k, then $15k, then $11k and ran out of fiat money at $10k.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:33:08
2 lambo.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:23:26
I don’t know what exchange people are looking at but binance remains over 7000. I haven’t got the ketchup out yet.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:52:38
I’m in a similar situation. Have faith in both the Lord and bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:08:09
I’m mining on my ZX Spectrum. Doesn’t seem to have struck bitcoin yet though. :(
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:49:42
Well, looky here. Bitcoin still above 8000. No dick for breakfast for me today. Will probably have sausage.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:17:49
I’m worried Bonance has done a Mt Gox and run off with my money.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:48:50
Nah, just panicked people who lost a load of money in January looking to ease their fear and make themselves feel better about losing a shit load of cash.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:09:30
No panic here. Cool like Patrick Bateman.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:03:15
Some of those crypto prices look like a bargain.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:25:39
100% agree. Shits gonna get real at 6.3k
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:14:34
Did you use a green or red dildo on her?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:59:33
Boom. Hammering down those sell walls with green dildos.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:14:45
A wise man once told me...”watch out for the doji star”. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:07:11
I’m worried that if it sinks any lower, I’ll owe bitcoin money. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:09:51
Don’t panic. I’ll eat my dick if we go below 7500. Strong support and an inverse batman formation mean that 7500 is our resting point before we attack 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:51:31
I’m in my fox-hole, ready to throw explosive green dildos back at them.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:24:58
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:52:05
At the end of the weekend/Monday morning, I reckon we’ll see a drop to 6500. This would complete the batman silhouette on the coinbase 1Y chart.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:30:47
When is this $8k shitcoin going to turn into 24-karat bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:32:06
Price was going up and everyone said BTC was heading to $100,000. That was before the media screwed us all over.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:18:53
Didn’t know that. If so, they’ll do it with bad news like uncovering something about tether.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:13:56
Yes, the reverse batman indicates strong support at 7500 and a bullish turn.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:55:01
Does anyone think this china ban could make things worse for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:47:01
I’ve got fear again.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:47:57
I’ve done some technical analysis. I predict a fall in price over the next 4-8hrs.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:45:44
Noobs gots to have Lambos too bro.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:45:44
I’m so scared. The batman formation came true and the price is descending and bonance is forcing a hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:57:50
Agree...something isn’t quite right. I’m panicking that all my coin will be robbed. Do you think they are moving my coin right now? :(
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:49:52
No, but imagine the start of a massive cup. It goes down then up then down and up for the handle. My theory is we are drawing the first downward line.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:56:35
I think we’ve hit the bottom. Sideways at 6-7k for a few days before the weak hands start to come out of the woodwork again. Unless tether screws it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:50:25
Arghhhh.....attack of the red dildos. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:17:38
Remember, bitcoin is a living breathing animal. It’s bigger than all of us put together and it is an entirely unpredictable beast. If you try to tame it, you could end up getting bitten. Just as it sank from 19k in a couple of weeks, it could rise up again from the ashes. You could wake up tomorrow and it’s at 25k. With bitcoin, anything is possible. Dreams can come true. Trust in the technology...believe in bitcoin. People do get lambos and people do walk on the moon because of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:07:16
I can feel hard resistance at 8000.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:37:02
If this is a pump and dump, I’ll pump and dump all over this computer screen. :-(
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:56:01
Only if this like the A-Team and we get a van.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:04:52
This is a classic dip before an ATH. We are just in the early stages of drawing a cup. We’ll draw a handle soon and hit $21000 before the end of next week. Classic fibonacci...1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21....8k tonight, 13k at some point midweek and 21k by the end of the week. Show me the money, show me the lambo.
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:05:16
You need to set limit buys then.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:04:09
Is it Magic Tree Black Ice? That’s the most manly air freshener for your Lambo.
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:14:32
I’ll own up. I’m Satoshi. I’ve got 50 Lambos and I eat as much pizza as I want. I’ve been to the moon and back. Don’t worry, not going to sell the genesis BTC, I keep it in a display case in my lounge.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:58:40
Remember hodlers...at least when it goes to 0, it can’t go down any further.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:20:21
What club? The club for those without a home?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:46:01
Who’s portfolio is down overall? Me...invested at $17k. Total loss $15,000. No biggie.
Sometimes I do wonder who has actually got my money.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:22:53
I’m mentally driving my Lambo over the BTCUSD chart. It’s a bumpy ride and it’s fukked up the suspension a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:30:20
Bitscoin is giving me a boner recently.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:00:50
I’m so scared. I don’t want to see 6k again.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:41:46
I woke up this morning with a boner for bitcoin...I’m feeling bullish today. Bring on 10k!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:41:29
Yes, but 2 bitcoins is better than 1.
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:00:03
Let battle for $10000 commence today. Arm yourselves with the biggest, longest green dildos you can. We will fight through the sell walls, kill the bears and victory will be ours. The reward will be Lambos and pizza for everyone. Regulators.....mount up.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:48:52
I’m bit-curious.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:15:39
Join the club. I’m approximately $15,000 down. I can’t afford it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:33:37
Bitcoin will live forever baby. We’re just like roaches, never dying, always living.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:36:58
HODL or you’ll regret it.
When you are imagining that Lambo driving off without you, leaving a bitter taste of hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide from its exhaust gas, its always best to ignore the USD value of your bitcoins. Just see that you have exactly the same number of bitcoins in the bank as you did before and one day those bitcoins will be worth a Lambo and you’ll be the guy inside with shades on and a blonde chick like the one from Outrun sat next to you. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:40:26
Guys, I can't chip away at this 8700 sell wall with just one green dildo. Come and give me a hand.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:23:16
I would like to buy some cheap bitcorn. Please can we make the price dip to 9300.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:37:27
You should put your money where your mouth is and offer to eat your dick, not your sock.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:32:59
Already eaten my delicious sausage. The bet was that I’d eat my own dick if I *woke up* to BTC being below 8k. Too late. No flies on me!
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:39:05
I’ve managed to relight.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:02:50
When bitcoin touches $10k, turtles head is gonna touch cloth. Boom!
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:24:56
March target is the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:07:52
Rockets don’t need support.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:18:04
Hodl through this stubborn resistance people.

Strap in boys and hodl tight, I’m firing this rocket ship back up and we’re heading to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:34:38
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:55:09
I think I got a lucky glitch. I just checked my binance account and I’ve still got the same amount of bitcoin as before the crash. Haven’t lost a thing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:06:44
100% agree.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:27:44
Too many red dildos. Red dildo make me sad.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:26:44
I’m still here. Just going to buy some ketchup....
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:40:39
Oh what’s that? A big green dildo pushes us back to 8200.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:39:47
Nope gone again. Women and children first.
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:05:17
And it’s back. McAffee should be forced to eat his own dick.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:07:23
Still -1’ing me mofo. I’ll find out who you are and jack all your bitcoins and give them away.
-1 this. I dare you.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:48:56
Give him $200. Wait 1 year. He give Lambo.

I hate the Express. FUD-spreading when the market is rising and push out positive articles when falling. Stirrers.

Can someone explain market manipulation in basic terms to a noob please. I'm assuming someone with a lot of bitcoins just puts massive buy orders to raise the price. This makes small timers believe there is a bull market who then buy in, raising the price more then the manipulator just sells?
Also, I've heard of exchanges wash trading...does this just mean they fulfil their own sell orders with buy orders which creates artificial volume, or is there more to it?
