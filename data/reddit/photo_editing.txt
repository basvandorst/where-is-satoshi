Yes it can affect scalability if it's too difficult for users to run nodes. This is not the case. If this was the case, Ethereum transactions would not be significantly cheaper and faster than Bitcoin transactions.  But they are.
If you genuinely believe Bitcoin scales better than Ethereum you are deluded.
Look at the volume of transactions, the transactions fees, and the confirmation times. 
Ethereum processes far, far more transactions than Bitcoin, and it does it cheaper and faster. How can you say it scales worse? You're incorrect and spreading misinformation.

Irrelevant to your original post &amp; my reply.  Ethereum scales better than Bitcoin. Your post is wrong.
You can run light nodes by the way; you do not need to run a full node. Obviously Ethereum has to store more information than Bitcoin as it is a more complex technology.

That statement is false (as you've admitted). You are spreading misinformation.
