But and hold guys, the very least before the halfening. There will be other hikes and crashes, we can profit from all with a cool head. Bitcoin will not go away unless the internet does. I doubt that will happen in the next decade.

Thank you kind sir. Please enjoy your birthday.

I needed money. I thought by trading I can make enough to pay for my phone bill at least. I make a dollar a day trading for about 35 minutes.

@_date: 2016-09-26 02:13:22
Yes but a hold in mass!
@_date: 2016-09-25 00:05:04
Why does this small fishy? 
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:13:47
In the positive  side, that .25 bitcoin  is out of the market  a true way to hodl. I am sorry for your loss but thank you for your sacrifice in the name of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-17 23:19:17
Wanna bet with bitcoin?  Lol if it were  only legal in the US.
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:53:40
I think  you may be right. 
@_date: 2016-09-30 23:08:47
Hi jos del coño! Now seriously  this is bull shit. Not to mention  hard to enforce if they use person to person sells. Maybe as far as to traveling  to another European nation to use it's  WiFi.

Nsfw means not safe for work. R/nsfw check it yourself at your own risk. Second  question: can I use it for day to day transactions?
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:49:59
Nope at the moment,  starting  college soon. I can't  buy one right now.
@_date: 2016-09-18 21:20:11

@_date: 2016-09-25 23:13:42
It is important  to notice  large  changes in volume. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 03:56:26
One day a month  or twice a year.  I am curious  if what would  happen.
@_date: 2016-09-30 19:09:56
I am gonna save some money in anticipation  of a spiral down. Then buy some cheaper coins for when  the price hikes up again 
@_date: 2016-09-24 23:07:40
Which one is better? Or your favorite? 
@_date: 2016-09-26 02:26:17
I have a pc and spend  some time on nsfw. I just wanna make sure no one hacks and takes screen shots or sees what I am typing. Am I too paranoid? 
@_date: 2016-09-26 19:06:57
Could  it be a Kremlin  government  plot to identify  bitcoin  users? Or perhaps a way to collect  bitcoins from the Russian  market?
@_date: 2016-09-26 05:26:50
Yea and have it as a community behavior  practice. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 18:59:32
It would  have to be a day that does not get overshadowed  by a major  holiday  and can be used to draw  public out. What are the Chinese  lucky  numbers?

@_date: 2016-09-19 22:36:13
If he had placed it in bitcoin, then moved it with a trezor they would have stolen the he wallet instead?
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:38:08
On a 5 year period?  Maybe  If it gets  wet? 
@_date: 2016-09-27 03:06:53

@_date: 2016-10-04 00:10:59
I think  I would  be more open to invest  in you than  other folks yet. I have pulled some funds and making a plan. I am nervous  but that's  bitcoin. I will give it more thought  though. 
@_date: 2016-10-02 22:28:07
@_date: 2016-10-03 00:51:05
I would have sold  20 a day and hold a big chunk.  I am happy with enough to cover taxes, house, school,  and saving. I would have only sold half and hide the rest.
@_date: 2016-10-08 03:23:16
If I had mining  equipment  I would  do that.  But can't  afford  it.
@_date: 2016-10-07 01:03:34
I have invested a bit. I will continue, this will be eventually make it 5-10% of my portfolio depending how I feel about it. Is me being in the US gonna be a problem?
@_date: 2016-10-02 22:56:53
Low volume  sucks.
@_date: 2016-10-03 02:05:49
Just made an account, seems promising.  I think  at the rates I need a decent  amount  of btc for this  in order to make my set goal.
@_date: 2016-10-02 03:32:39
Is there a platform where  I lend bitcoins  and gain bitcoin  interest back.
@_date: 2016-10-11 04:39:06
I am surprised the multiplier  is better for Clinton. Does that  mean the market  leans on  trump.
@_date: 2016-10-03 02:19:45
