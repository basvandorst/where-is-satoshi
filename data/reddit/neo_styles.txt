And yet nobody had to pick up a gun and pull the trigger...
It’s obvious this will be a circular argument. You allow yourself to exist in an idealistic world while you choose to ignore what happens outside your personal circle. You aren’t too big to fail. They are. End of story.

* Bitcoin is a slow energy-inefficient dinosaur that will never be able to process transactions as quickly or inexpensively as an Excel spreadsheet*
And how much time does it currently take to process a transaction on Sundays or weekdays after 8PM EST?

Okay, so it's discontinued. That's why I wasn't able to find it. Thanks!

Do you understand the meaning of the term literally? Doesn't apply in this scenario. Point taken. Thanks.

I'm in America's economy. BTC has yet to be commercially adopted well enough here to allow it to be the sole source of income/spending. So far, I still have to use fiat to pay my taxes (though the state of Arizona is working to fix that), which means they're a necessary evil for the time being.
Furthermore, wouldn't we want evil things to become good rather than just die? They may be using their power in crappy ways now, but they have enough infrastructure in terms of networking to possibly be a major positive player if they were to legitimately embrace cryptocurrencies. I don't want to stop them; I want to *rehabilitate* them.

Did someone forget to mention to The Guardian that cryptocurrencies and public open blockchains were never meant to be used by banks?
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:28:53
Is that a lot?

Nostradamus predicted that the bottom [end] of Bitcoin would be 3797. From there, it’s up to Heaven’s Gate to take us up to the moon.

So let's say I think you're evil. Should I just say FUCK YOU right back? Should I never expect you to *not* be evil? My god, you're just coming across as narrow-minded; please come back to the real world.
@_date: 2018-03-10 06:48:27
Since you brought that up and I'm sure more people are going to look here, is there any chance that *this* is legit?
I've only ever heard of the Nano S, so this looked like an instant red flag. Just want to see if I'm not being overly paranoid.

I know this is a bit old and some of you may have already heard this, but I found it really useful to hear that maybe...just maybe...regulators will be able to see what we’re trying to accomplish with Bitcoin.

I think we found our award winner for this year’s “Most Pretentious Prick”

Apologies if this was already linked, but who are they trying to fool? They're reaching. Hard.
@_date: 2018-03-10 08:12:27
Well, whether you like it or not, it's going to take a loooooooooong time before their complete failure is even a possibility, so what happens for the time being? I give them my attention so I can be prepared to block if they come swinging; shouldn't you be, too?

Things have gotten to the point where the mere mention of the word regulation causes my blood to boil. People ask me why I bother investing in BTC (isn’t it already on its way out?). Now it’s really easy to explain to them how not almighty the dollar is. And to amplify your concerns, it almost makes me applaud the miners since every coin they find is one less the banks can get.

At r/bitcoin, this is a very dangerous mentality to possess. More than half the downvotes I’ve ever received come from here by simply trying to engage in an intelligent discussion. In my opinion, the general mindset shows they only see the prize, not the effort.

Because Nicehash. If I transfer out of their internal wallet, I can go through two exchanges and then to my wallet to avoid fees. Otherwise, I’d take a 30% loss going straight from their wallet system to mine.

This is why I tell people at work I support Bitcoin. It’s just a proof of concept. Blockchain is the real money maker (no pun intended)
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:55:28
That. Was. Amazing.
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:22:33
Which is why I made a disclaimer apologizing in advance if that was the case. Thanks for being a dick about it

See, I’m *learning*! Thanks for letting me know. Helps me figure out where to put my financial focus next.

Not begging, just positing. I feel like they're going to be the ones begging to be a part, so I'm surprised they haven't tried their hands at it yet.

Let me bring in the optimist’s perspective of a late adopter (me).
Bitcoin used to just seem to me as a way for someone to make up their own currency. If it was funny money, why invest?
Blockchain. That’s why. Once I realized BTC is really just a proof of concept for what blockchains are capable of doing, I wanted to give it my support. Maybe greed is a factor for some, but I want to hope that there’s a growing wave of ethical adopters as well.
I mine myself, but couldn’t care less about the profit. There’s a much bigger prize at the end of the road if we can see the key elements of BTC spread out into modern economics.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:08:40
I’m not. Please don’t speak for me.

All is not lost. They also have a configurator if you already needed a case and power supply to go with the GPU? Are they straight retail? No, but they’re close enough for the steady availability they keep.
