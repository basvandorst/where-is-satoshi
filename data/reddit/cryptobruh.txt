awesome thanks! investigating the process but it looks like its often a road that alot of people don't travel on.

Is address reuse really that bad if for long term storage?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:19:31
yeah they paper I feel like it would work Im just worried about the hackability of a device that connects to the internet via USB.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:37:17
the only thing i hate about the passphrase is that it needs to be entered in the computer
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:18:29
That makes sense. I guess if I ever get to the point where I have 50+ BTC something feels unsettling about having a device connected to the internet in one wallet.
But it seems like I just need to trust the process especially since there seems to be no better options out there

so the increase in inputs is that just terminology talk for how fast of a priority you send it with?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:27:16
thanks! def gives me confidence in the process. is that what you use for cold storage/keeping coins safe?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:58:36
no thats a good question. just researching for the past few weeks on that certain subject the consensus is that hardware is safer because with paper wallets both the creating and eventual spending of the wallet has potential to be compromised on a malware infected device.
with hw, even with a infecteed device, its supposedly impossible to infect the actual key
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:10:25
That makes sense! I just figured if you've never sent a money to anyone or to another address that is owned by someone else, then that might mitigate that risk of privacy?

i would just wait for cryptohwwallet....there supposed to be getting some in 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:21:08
wait is it really $85 for every bitcoin? so 50 bitcoins would be like $400?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:24:52
thats a good question...how do you know? would a passphrase negate having a non-random key?
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:46:19
Wouldn't the ultimate safe option be using multisig with a hardware wallet? The odds of both the software and multiple hw vendors being compromised is low?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:56:18
its a certified authorized dealer of trezors and ledgers. its in cali so youll get it much faster!
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:41:51
Just buy one trezor t and one ledger. Multisig on electrum 2 of 2 and youre done
@_date: 2018-12-22 00:29:42
I just see most of the top addresses in the world that are multisig constantly use their own address to deposit/withdraw and store long term. It might not be the best privacy wise but for a long term hodl situation there is no security risk right?!
