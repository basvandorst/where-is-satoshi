Well as you might imagine I am not all day reading these conversations, but what you are saying is that you don't care about the fluctuations but all the bidders do, which equally leads to question the strenght of bitcoin as a real currency and not another product paved for speculation.

Then answer it.

Well I was wondering just that... but it seems that in this forum these kind of questions tend to annoy some people.

I judge the idea of a cryptocurrency very favorably, but I think it should have a fixed exchange rate to a real currency in order to be really usable otherwise it is just pure speculation.

The fact that everything has intrinsict value does not mean we can extract money from it. I would gladly accept your turd if you ran the costs of tranportation and you delivered it free from other nasty chemicals that normaly run trough the sewers. Another example of this sort of situation can also be exemplified when oil wells have been left abandoned despite having substantial amounts of crude in them, because the costs of extracting said product are not covered by its value in the current market. I though this concept was quite obvious.

1. So when other cryptocurrencies pick up momentum bitcoin will see its value slashed.
2. The limitation to 21 mllions is useless if an infinite number of cryptocurrencies might be created. Prayers and good wishes can also be transacted cheaply and anonymously.
3. It is not what wikipedia says.

Everything that is tangible has inherent value, gold is a very convenient monetary standard because it is scarce and does not loose its properties with the passing of time. Before the existence of central banks gold was already used as a minting material.
In the even of a complete bankrupt of regulatory institutions you could keep using gold in exchange of other goods, that's why in periods of unrest in the stock markets the price of the gold tends to rise.

Well, a single turd might have marginal value, but I can assure you that a couple of tons of turds is something that many farmers or manure treatment factories are willing to pay for.

More questions:
What stops people from using other virtual currencies?
What gives bitcoin its value apart from people believing it has some value?
Real money has the gold reserves of the central bank that at least partially back it up, what tangible goods back up bitcoin?

The mind of the human might make the value of something fluctuate but from the moment that this something might be used to ensure our security or dominance over others it will have a value not equal to zero.
