CaVirtex is attempting to seek regulation in Canada that makes it harder for anyone to compete with them: During their testimony in front of Canada's senate committee on banking, trade and commerce they directly asked the government to put up hoops that other companies must jump through so not anyone can set up an exchange.

Estimate of 10 billion troy ounces in the world at 1300 each gives us 620k when divided 21 million ways.
It doesn't matter though. Bitcoin isn't gold. It won't replace gold because its different. The long term BTC price has more to do with what it costs to use, and I don't just mean fees.

If you look at the google trends 2004-present graph it looks like it would track very nicely with an inverse log of the BTC/USD price. 
What i mean is, each time BTC peaked we saw increases in interest, but each price peak was 5x the last one and the interest peak was perhaps double or less than double its last peak.
This might describe a more general phenomena where it takes much more for previously disinterested people to become interested in something compared with those who are perhaps more familiar with ideas that make it easier to get into.
I'm not sure. This seems to me like a difficult time to easily say how interested people are in general. Splashy news headlines and big stories generate passing interest; like people who love a given Olympic sport but completely ignore it through 4 year intervals.

Many online poker rooms are sketchy organizations that pool funds and don't follow best practices for cash segregation. Gamble if you like, but the counter-party risk is high variance.
All of these services will soon be decentralized and offered in a trustless way so you do not need to give someone else your money to play on the network.
We don't need another Gox / Ultimate Bet / Absolute Poker / Lock Poker scenario where everyone loses their money because of incompetent or dishonest people. At least in full tilt's case the PokerStars owner bought them out and paid everyone. That will probably not happen in Bitcoin.

This isn't even accurate. BitGo does use multisig but only ever has access to one key. The remaining two are held by the user: one for every day transactions, and another as a back-up. Any two can sign a transaction. This gives the user full autonomy. If the servers are compromised, your money is safe. If they go broke and close shop, your money is still safe.

Yeah, in this spot I think context and familiarity matter. The usage of "one k" in language is relatively new. Anyone over 40 is more familiar with one grand, and "one k" may actually have come from the internet. What hasn't made its way into normal usage is 1 milli.

The experience you've just described is alien to me. I've never hated something like that and taken the approach you described. What actually caused you to think differently? Why did it hit you?
When I first heard about bitcoin in 2010 I thought "store this in mental memory and decide later." At the time I didn't have the proper information to form an opinion.
In either case it seemed more like an opportunity, either to take advantage of bad decisions people were making and somehow short the market or to take advantage of new technology and invest. This approach allows me to be pretty dispassionate no matter which way it goes.

This is a good question. No matter what the answer is, its useful to know.

His final remarks: 'technology cannot save us from government' are interesting. 
Others, who support crypto-anarchism, have pointed out that cryptography can enable nearly absolute privacy and obfuscation of activities by default, and these hard cryptographic problems can scale up the difficulty in an arms race against those who would infringe.
In cryptography we may really have a technology that makes the task of ubiquitous surveillance and theft of digital property intractably difficult. 
Distributed technologies of this variety make the task harder still, and we see this in things like Dark Wallet and Dark Market. 
It seems almost inevitable that this trend will proceed as it has for P2P file sharing towards highly disruptive technologies that unseat all centralized operations that profit by retaining special access to the distribution of value.

You talk about volatility like it only goes in one direction: down. 
Volatility describes the extent of the dispersion, the variance, and this exists in all games of chance. What gamblers look to maximize is their edge, their win-rate, their expected value.
Any effect that maximizing ones win-rate has on variance is secondary, and quite often increasing your edge also increases volatility which a thoughtful gambler will offset by maintaining a larger bankroll.

There's a third option. Very soon there might be fully decentralized autonomous contracts which allow anyone to do their bitcoin related taxes near-instantly without the need of a trusted third party; simply provide payment to the contract along with the list of all of your account addresses which have spent money over the last year and it automatically calculates AND pays your taxes, provides cryptographically signed zero-knowledge proof that you have paid, but therefore gives no one observing this process knowledge of how much you paid, or who you are: it simply shows that you paid the right amount.

Change doesn't happen perfectly or even all at once. It'll take a while, but it is possible. Banking hasn't changed all that much since the Italian renaissance, roughly 600 years ago. It's about time.
I also don't have all the answers. I don't have a crystal ball and can't predict the future. What I suspect is this: In the short term these contracts will calculate your Bitcoin taxes and provide whatever personal details the government requires. Then you can submit them yourself.
I don't expect this will go on forever. It will become more clear over time that this process is unnecessarily complex and inefficient compared to alternatives; a sort of hangover from legacy banking.
People have been paying capital gains on investments for a long time. If people evade taxes they will risk severe punishments.

As an outsider, I get the sense that a lot of Shibes really don't care about the price. They've built a community that does some funny things, and it's kind of amazing.
Here in we focus on the price a lot, and I'm not sure we're better off for it. I wouldn't be desperate for a price increase even if it hit 100 dollars. The game has already changed, and cryptocurrency in general is a massive favorite to win.
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:41:05
I think price are dropping because the economy is starting to contract. World wide, there's a huge economic bubble, and when it bursts a lot of speculators who got into bitcoin on borrowed money will be forced to sell. In the short term this will make bitcoin look like a failed experiment, but people will be surprised when it never goes away. Simply put, we may still be in for several months of slumping prices. Dark market is a small fish by comparison.

1) bitcoin neutrality means the bits are the bits and preferential treatment is not given to one address vs another. (edit: a better way to say it is **all bitcoins are created equal**)
6) places that don't have reliable access to a power grid/internet are often unbanked. redundant methods of access is another method of distributing the technology.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:44:51
That will change soon. Bitcoin's technology will not only offer banking that we enjoy to the unbanked. It will bring with it the whole range of privileged investment options that the top 1% have enjoyed, and out of that brilliant people will arrive out of nowhere to make enormous sums of money.
Right now for instance, there is no way for you to hedge your bitcoin investment using smart contracts, but that's right around the corner.

Don't answer that.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:26:22
A Colored coin is a digital asset that represents something else (a barrel of oil IOU, a deed for a car, whatever you define). 
Suppose I create a colored coin that represents one ounce of gold redeemable at my gold company. Anyone who purchases colored coins that represent my gold will hold an IOU for one ounce of gold, held at my company. If they spend coins of that color, the recipient of the coin will hold the IOU.
Imagine that you want to host a concert, and you create a colored coin to represent a digital ticket. People could buy those *colored coin* tickets for bitcoin at whatever price you were charging, and would give them to the door man (using their smart phone) in exchange for access to the concert.
Making colored coins is not free per-say; you'll need a few satoshis to create a few colored coins. After that anyone can set an arbitrary price for their colored coin. 
If I made one colored coin to represent my house, I could then sell you the cryptographic deed on my house (as the colored coin) and you would have cryptographic proof of ownership to back that up, but I would certainly charge you a hefty sum for the property!
As I understand it, the problem with colored coins is that they cannot do one of the things bitcoin is fantastic for: **simplified payment verification**. When you look up your bitcoin transaction, the bitcoin network doesn't need to confirm all of the transactions that took place prior to yours in order to prove that they're really your coins. Instead it just checks the block headers to make sure they're using the correct "code" (the hash of the block header).
With Colored coins, verifying payments takes longer because the bitcoin network is not color aware. To know the colors of all coins it needs to scan through the transaction record since the creation of the colored coin. For this reason I expect that colored coins on top of the bitcoin blockchain will be best used for things that get used once, like concert tickets.

So you're saying you don't have evidence that he likes to be "that guy." The reason I'm asking is that if the basis for your opinions is not at all grounded in evidence, then your opinions become arbitrary with respect to the facts and it becomes easier to see how you might think someone else would shift their own perspective based on nothing more than what other people think.

There are far to many algorithm bots that immediately push the envelop as news breaks. The price is the price is the price, and if it seems lower than you'd expect its only because most of the economy expects to derive a bigger edge in other areas. It's all OK though.

Regarding your edit, I'm happy to provide this view.
It's important to preface this with a statement: violence starts with the initiation of force. The initiation of force is immoral.
Child pornography is evidence of a crime. Children should never be forced to expose themselves, and destroying the evidence does not prevent the crime. Our focus should be on preventing evil people from violently abusing the rights of children instead of destroying evidence.
Killing someone for money is evil. Do you have any evidence that people were killed by hitmen because of silk road? This may happen, but the problem is not freedom. Safeguarding individuals by abusing their freedom requires someone to have a monopoly on the initiation of force against those people (which is immoral).
An open, anonymous market serves as a way for people to engage in free trade. When you and I agree and engage in trade, it is mutually beneficial. Anyone who stops us from engaging in free trade is forcing us to do things against our will, which is immoral (given the opening premise).
To sum up, an anonymous marketplace does not change the fact that force is evil. It does however enable people to engage in trade in ways that are hard to stop. This is a big win for freedom.
Finally, if this strikes a cord with you then you may find yourself wondering about "political credibility." It's a long road.

 I actually posted exactly the criticisms you're highlighting a few days ago. In fact I got down voted to hell for pointing them out. 
Some people think that if you're on the same side of an argument it's "wrong" to call out irrational lines of thinking. That's not how I do things. Irrational belief is always stupid, no matter which side of the argument you're on. Or if you're on different sides, people think you have to disagree on everything: also crazy.
But I'm not afraid of the problems, because I see people solving them gradually. Bitcoin works for me right now for some things. I've found ways to build an investment portfolio with a small starting capital because of bitcoin, and I manage risks very carefully. 
Bitcoin doesn't work for everyone for everything, and its a personal assessment. I don't know what works for you. 
Not everyone is situated for bitcoin to work well for them yet. If it didn't work for me I wouldn't use it.

Language is all about distributed consensus. We both agree that the words I'm writing have a meaning, and if I say something rude unintentionally then I'm likely to find that out. If I communicate poorly then you won't understand me.
But words are just one kind of technology. The words we use to describe other kinds of technology don't tell us what they are. If Dark Market helps people to avoid ruthless regulations and make money by providing valuable and moral services, then I say that's good no matter what we call the tech that enables them.

"Banks" that hold bitcoin are a point of weakness. It's virtually certain that such banks can be bailed out in fiat, and some of them will fail because of negligence and incompitence.
Legacy banks needed personal information so they could validate spending. Companies used your information like a password to pull money from your account.
Bitcoin doesn't work like that. Bitcoin uses push mechanisms, and so "banks" do not need your personal information to provide services.
KYC requirements for Bitcoin assume a priori that you are suspected of criminal fraud, and that you must submit to a background check investigation in exchange for services.

It strikes me as odd that people focus so much on names.
What about the fact that we're looking at potentially game changing technology?
Once P2P filesharing was decentralized, it was game over for brick &amp; mortar video rental businesses. Bittorrent changed the game for those guys, because they no longer had a monopoly on the distribution of entertainment.
A decentralized marketplace changes the game for any company that makes money solely because they're a distribution center. 
People will use Dark Market where it provides an advantage over competing options, and not for any superficial reasons (like it's name).

With bitcoin Employers and employees could enter into escrow arrangements for pay. The employee would know the money was already there before completing work.
At first this sounds like it might tie up a lot of money, but that's only because legacy banking and accounting costs have led employers to pay people bi-weekly. With bitcoin people could theoretically be paid every 10 minutes for work in progress. Anyways, maybe this obvious and not what you were asking.

Communism, in theory says that stealing from people and acting on their behalf is the best way to serve their interests, which is nonsense. I don't appreciate the comparison because I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. You can do whatever you want.
Secondly, addressing the overhead costs of using bitcoin is a real practical issue. I can't solve that on a message board, so its irrational for you to expect that. Right now Bitcoin is hard for people to buy, sell, secure, and understand; those are real costs that make bitcoin a bad value proposition for huge segments of society.
Finally, I'm not here to play wack-a-mole with every concern you have. If something else works better for you, then it makes sense for you to use that. Anything short of doing whats best for us would be pretty stupid, and on this point I think we agree.

If Bitcoin gets easier for people in all areas, then they'll bid more for the ability to use Bitcoin - right up until its marginally profitable and reaches an equilibrium.
