Yes, you are correct.

I don't see how this leads to bitcoin positions being taxed as income. How is a bitcoin position entered before 1 Jan 2014 "inconsistent with the final regulations" and thus, apparently, not treatable as capital gains?

The capital gains rates are staying the same, but the Medicare tax pertains to investment income and thus will increase the amount paid on capital gains. This is a noteworthy distinction.

I'm not pissing anywhere; I'm simply asking where the evidence is for specific claims about the bitcoin's value ($40K, $1 mil, etc.), adoption rates, etc. from its followers.
Your bit about 'either believing in the concept or not' sounds like a religious person lecturing about God, perhaps reinforcing one of my points. We're talking about a putative currency, bro, not a philosophical doctrine.

Thanks bro, this the sort of analysis that I was hoping rational proponents of bitcoin were capable of.

-I don't believe I'm asking for a "quantification of opinions"; I'm asking for clarification on already quantified opinions about the price (which is what I mean by 'value') of the bitcoin. They're already quantified because they are asserting the likelihood of bitcoin hitting specific price points up and down the spectrum.
If we agree that such assertions don't have any real evidence in their favor at present, then it seems we've nothing to argue about.
-Why is it absurd to value a cryptocurrency in terms of a fiat currency? Even if their values are utterly subjective, we're still asserting something definite and useful about the former. How's this any different from valuing other fiat currencies in terms of each other?
-On the point of religious faith, I simply mean to say that asserting "you either get it or you don't" is reasoning analogous to the sort many religious persons use to "support" their beliefs. It's an affective proclamation with no hint of logic behind it. Maybe your claims don't fit this description, but certainly much of what I read from bitcoin 'disciples' does.

Thank you for your thoughts.
I suppose that with the reconstructed Winklevoss argument you've made here, the main premise in need of support is that bitcoin market cap will increase to anything like $1 tril. It seems to me that such predictions are still articles of faith rather than statements with firm evidence in their favor.
But I don't deny that that faith might make people a lot of money. I'd just like to make decisions with my money based on reasoning other than faith-based premises.

OK, I'm open to the possibility that such dogmatism is in the minority. But I still don't see any economic analyses that properly cite actual data pointing toward any of the bitcoiner's claims about price points and the like. 
The state of the argument seems to be stuck at: "It's a great idea and therefore it ought to be worth more sometime in the future!"
