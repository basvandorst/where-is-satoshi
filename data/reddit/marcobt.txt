as someone said yesterday, Bitcoins are much harder to confiscate and regulate. In the US, the government made it illegal once to even own gold...

Berlin rules! It seems like there are at least 3 Bitcoin related meetups or exchanges a week!

What stresses of a gold standard are you referring to?
At that point in time, there was no clean gold standard as in pre ww I days. the gold exchange standard was in place and governments around the world wanted to have their cake and eat it too!
So the US government essentially stole massive amounts of gold from their citizen and foreign holders of gold on US soil by giving them paper, which they would quickly devalue... it's plain and simple theft

is this based on experience with other coursera courses? or just a warning against general procrastination?

the biggest problem I see with gold is divisibility... even those little 1 gram plates of gold won't help you pay at the grocery store

“Spreading the false gospel of Keynes, cursing the deflationary spirit, and cheering for martian war… what hasn’t Salvation4BTC forgiven for me! I will continue to spread the Bitcoin gospel to my longtime colleagues, much like Jesus did to the tax collectors and prostitutes.
