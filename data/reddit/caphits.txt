This is pretty much the only reason I dislike VOS. Not accepting USD is pretty much standard these days.

And it literally didn't exist before that.

I have never heard of anyone ever using Western Union for a money transfer.

Man, I'm stumped...
EDIT: Holy crap dude. I just looked up your older cipher post and it was totally crazy difficult. Good luck everyone. You'll need it!

It would not surprise me if she uses them through a centralized bank. I know that bitcoin really pushes for that, but if 'mom' can't go into somewhere (online or brick and mortar) and see exactly what her coins are doing, she is going to have a hard time. I think she would want some sort of person that can say, "We can reverse the charges." or, "If your bitcoins are stolen, they are insured by the FDIC." I know it goes against so much of what bitcoins are "for," but I really don't think 'mom' wants to have backups upon backups and hard-drives that have never touched the internet before (or whatever), or be conscious of security at all.
There must be some good incentive to get away from the EXTREME easiness of swiping your card at a terminal and walking away instantly, or using a stored credit card on amazon. At least for 'mom' that is. Security is just taken for granted by 'mom,' and until bitcoin security can go by the wayside (still secure, but she never thinks about what is happening), 'mom' is probably not going to jump on the bandwagon.

I'm not trolling. I'm asking a serious question. How do you "FUCKED THE DAMN BANKSTERS!" when trying to purchase a home?

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Especially in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:41:36
Stop buying asshole! You're making the price tank!

If you invest more than you need to survive, you're retarded.

They should start their own crypto. Coincoin.

This seems pretty simple, if you are in good communication with the person. Just call them and ask them to read out the address and see if it matches. Simple form of 2 factor authentication should be enough. It's good enough for exchanges, it's good enough for me.

It should have been so obvious this whole time.

You know this has been happening for MONTHS right coinbase?
