First buy in.
Annnnnnnd now I'm hooked, queue a day of watching GDAX. Am i doing this right?

I seen a post earlier last week about using GDAX (as part of your Coinbase account) to transfer coins to your wallet fee free. Has anyone done this and uses it regularly?

I knew all the reading would pay off by DCA'ing my way in...at £14,500

So how come so many people advocate against Coinbase because of the high fees but other platforms don't have as cheap a price ? Kinda works out the same

Thanks

Not much, £20, I plan to buy every couple weeks. From what I've read it's better to get something out this over a long run than the short term...HODL is it hahaha
