Bitcoin does not, and cannot, work as a fractional reserve banking system. In a fractional reserve banking system, banks create new money by issuing debt. This form of currency creation via debt doesn't work with Bitcoin. 
That's not to say you can't have a debt with Bitcoin. But that debt cannot serve to issue more Bitcoin. That is the big difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:23:15
Dude wake up and smell the coffee. These are the same guys that ruined the currency, economy and ran the country into the ground. Do you really think anything good can come of them creating a state owned crypto currency?
1. It'll probably have a back-door for them to tinker with the inflation rate and other aspects of the currency. Who knows, it might even be fully centrally controlled. 
2. Do you really think they'll roll over and make it "easily exchanged" with bitcoin? They're afraid of bitcoin and of losing power that's why they're creating the petro.

It's not possible to spend bitcoin several times.
Inflation simply isn't possible with Bitcoin. Perhaps with bitcoin promises, but who'd accept those?
There are many other reasons Bitcoin lending won't ever work. Firstly because the interest rate would need to be greater than Bitcoin's gain in value. Secondly because there would never be enough Bitcoin to repay the debt + interest. Fractional reserve banking relies on perpetual inflation to cover principal + interest. If debt issuance comes to a halt, the entire system implodes.

Bitcoin is never inflationary, regardless of how it's used.
If banks allow Bitcoin to be used as surety, then yes, those loans will create inflation. The inflation won't ever occur with Bitcoin. It would happen in whatever fiat currency being 'loaned' by banks.

One dollar in 1913 was equivalent to $506.15 in 2008. Inflation of 2430.8% which doesn’t take into account rising housing costs and other asset bubbles that soak up some of the inflation.

Inflation works by having more money in the system than there was previously. It's not rocket science. However the money is created it has the same net effect.
What you're talking about is hyperinflation. Banks cause inflation and are also responsible for creating asset bubbles. Most notably in residential real estate.
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:24:20

Yes they do.


Depends on how you define "sinks economies". Asset bubbles certainly sink economies, we saw this during the 2008/09 financial crisis. Those problems haven't been resolved.
Also, any percent of compounding inflation creates a parabolic curve. Even the government's offical 2% target inflation rate eventually turns parabolic.

That may only indicate that buyers can't spend a cent because there are no sell orders.

I disagree. If all buy orders instantly disappeared, and everyone refused to sell. The price would be derived from the last sale price, and would remain static until a new trade was made.
No buyers and no sellers = no volume and a static price fixed at the last trade.

That’s true from a retail speculator perspective. There’s a lot of other factors to consider. Larger investors need volume/depth, trust, board approval ... etc. the longer Bitcoin remains king the harder it will be to dethrone.

Except, MySpace wasn’t listed on every exchange and you didn’t need a MySpace account in order to get a Facebook account.  MySpace didn’t have strong relationships with payment providers. Facebook users didn’t jump back to MySpace if something went wrong. There wasn’t tax implications for switching from MySpace to Facebook. 
People generally used either Facebook or MySpace the choice was very polarised. With crypto it’s common to hold multiple. 
Also. Most first time crypto buyers buy Bitcoin as a safe way to dip their toes in the water.

It's not that I think your toenails are worthless. It's more that I think everyone else would view them as worthless. And I think they'd view them as worthless because they're not fungible, not tradable, and have no inherent properties that allow a value to be assigned to them. They may be valuable to you, but not to everyone else. Whereas my time has a value based on skills acquired and a generally accepted market rate. 
Deer and pheasants are not in infinite supply, their supply is limited by their surroundings, food, predators ... etc. They are a finite resource. Would the people turn up to your land to hunt them if they weren't there anymore? Also, your land is not an infinite supply.

Personally I don't think there will be market for Bitcoin loans. My reason is because Bitcoin interest rates would need to be higher than the return on Bitcoin's rise in value. Because it's a deflationary currency the appreciation in value will continue to be high, so it would make sense to sit on the bitcoin rather than risking it as a loan. 
There's also the fact that it's impossible to create new bitcoin based on loans. Like the traditional fractional reserve banking system currently does.

U.S. airlines used 17,044,700,000 gallons of fossil fuel in 2016 ( It's calculated that 88% of air travel is for pleasure. That's 14,999,336,000 gallons of fuel, which equates to approx. 592.5 TWh per year (
This means pleasure flights on U.S. airlines account for 30.2 times more energy than bitcoin's 30.14TWh a year. 
Now we can see the real energy elephant in the room.

No. I’m showing how wrong all the ‘Bubble’ callers were back in 2012.

Because every bubble in history was heralded by a vast majority of "experts" right before a crash. 
It gives me confidence knowing there are so many "experts" calling bitcoin a bubble. 
The main reason Bitcoin is called a bubble is the rapid price rise. But the reality is, the price rise should be viewed more as an indicator of technology adoption. It wasn't called a bubble when people adopted other technologies such as electricity, telephone, toaster, washing machine ... etc.

In a low-interest debt based monetary system (fiat), savers are heavily punished. While debtors are rewarded in two ways: 1. they get first access to funds, before they contribute to inflation, and 2. their debt is diminished by inflation. 
With Bitcoin, savers are heavily rewarded. 
Big difference.

Bitcoin is on the tipping point of reaching critical mass with its network effect. That can't be diminished easily because there are a lot participants who have established trust and technical relationships with Bitcoin, there's also a lot of people willing to accept/trade bitcoin in countries like Africa and Venezuela where their currency is falling apart. Do you think they will jump on some new unproven coin? No.
Switching social network has little consequence. Buying a new crypto currency has financial consequence. If there's a fundamental flaw found in said new currency it could literally go to zero overnight. Bitcoin provides stability. So I think there will always be a large market for it. And personally I think it will continue to be king for many years to come.

With every market there's only ever a small percent of volume that determines market prices. If you look at houses, stocks and other investments, there's rarely more than a small fraction of the overall market that are actually traded.

Hardly. Most bubbles are only apparent in hindsight. There's usually a few insignificant people who call a bubble early. Mostly they are ignored. But I'd love to read about a bubble where the majority called it beforehand. Do you have any examples?

With Bitcoin the USD price is merely an indication that a new technology is being adopted. A technology that stores value better than any previously known. That's why it will go vertical for years, then flatten into a S-curve as it stabilizes, possibly in the 6 or 7 figure range. 
Most new technologies formed an S-curve in their adoption phase. Electricity, internet, toasters, washing machines, automobiles ... to name a few. Bitcoin will form a S-curve too. However, unlike other technologies Bitcoin's S-curve will be reflected in its unit price.

Silver is currently undervalued. Bitcoin is more undervalued. 
Mike Maloney runs a business that sells precious metals. He will always be looking for an angle to sell more, and convincing bitcoin holders to buy some seems like an easy sell. A lot of them have money, all he needs to do is slip in a bit of FUD then do the soft-sell on gold and silver. He's a master at public speaking and convincing. Ultimately he's been wrong on gold and silver. If you read his book, he touts gold and silver as the next big inter-generational wealth transfer. I think history will show that that the transfer is happening now with bitcoin. Meanwhile gold and silver flounder along not really doing anything.

With bitcoin, my wealth is locked in. If I have 1 bitcoin I have 1/21,000,000 share of the wealth.

1. Bitcoin is a novel and disruptive technology. 
2. Almost everyone has a chance to purchase some. 
3. The supply side is inelastic. The demand side has no theoretical upper limit.
Normally with new technologies, early investment is available to wealthy (sophisticated) investors. Retail investors normally must wait till companies are tradable on stock exchanges. With Bitcoin it's open to everyone and they can invest almost any quantity.

In that case ALL futures should be using a different clearing house to that of non-leveraged equities. Futures are inherently risky, clearing houses are good at managing that risk buy using margin and position requirements.

On the other hand banks and governments have been racking up tens and hundreds of thousands per citizen, and that's just for the last round of bailouts.

Inflation is not good when it's combined with fractional reserve banking which allows banks to choose how/where new money is allocated. It creates asset bubbles (i.e. real estate), and encourages riskier types of investment strategies. These ultimately end in disaster for both savers and investors. It creates an unstable system.
Perhaps a constant low rate of inflation in a crypto currency scenario would be a desirable thing. Because new money isn't forced into any one asset class.

My only regret is not selling more gold and silver to buy a larger BTC stake. 
I think it's a good idea to hold both precious metals and Bitcoin.

Many are still coming to terms with what Bitcoin is, and what it may become. 
At the moment it doesn't make a perfect currency. But it does have huge advantages with regard to sending funds internationally. 
Even if Bitcoin only becomes a form of digital gold, and only captures 5% of that trade, it still puts the price above $20,000 USD. 
It's early days yet. The gyrations are flushing out speculative buyers. Many who sell now will buy back in above $5,000 USD.

Bitcoin exchanges in various countries for the most part operate almost completely independent from other countries. There's a few exchanges that operate across multiple countries, but China's exchanges seem almost completely isolated due to capital controls.

Bitcoin isn't for the faint of heart. If you can't put it away and wait for 2-5 years without needing it for something or other, you simply shouldn't buy.  
In hindsight I have regret for every time I sold BTC, but have never regretted buying, even when it was at a new all time high, and subsequently dropped. Because I HODLed it eventually didn't matter. 
Buy some BTC, secure your private keys, then go about your normal life for 2-5 years. When you return it'll either be a small fortune, or worthless. I'm guessing the former.

This can't happen with Bitcoin. Shows how dated and error-prone the banking system really is.

China accounts for ~20% of Bitcoin trade.

Well someone got some cheap Bitcoin from all this China FUD.

I'd love to match up the BTC graph with the Chrome 'Lines' experiment. That project lets you draw a line, then it will match a map location somewhere (i.e. coastline, river line ... etc).

With JPMorgan's musical chairs, everyone is forced to borrow 10 chairs, and pay them back with 20. All the while chairs are being skimmed while people aren't looking.

My trading expertise would have me sell at $3900 and buy back at $6900. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:59:06
No. Because those exchanges will no longer contribute to selling pressure. If anything the price could even go up after the closure(a). Especially since a lot of miners are in China. Where will miners sell their coins? They'll be forced to HODL. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:57:04


I hear this sentiment a lot. It's as if many people have Stockholm syndrome for banking and a debt based monetary system. 
The reality is there are better ways to create and distribute new currency than by using debt. I suspect there will be better crypto currencies than Bitcoin. Ones that have a slight rate of inflation and clever/smarter ways to distribute the newly created money.

I don't think governments want to ban Bitcoin. What they will do is create their own crypto currencies. Then there'll be an on-chain atomic swapping between all major crypto currencies. This will enable gov to track more than they ever dreamed possible, including all Bitcoin transactions in and out of their currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:45:29
At which point it's time to switch to another government. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:38:32


They can't track food, beer ... etc. Do they let you buy them?
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:52:22

Some countries have "unexplained wealth" laws which give the gov huge scope to take anything they like. Even when you can prove the origins, it'll still take years in court to recover.

There’s no intrinsic value. They just move things from one place to another, and cost a lot to maintain.

Not sure what type of utopian world you live in. But here on earth, for hundreds of years, we've had a debt based monetary system. The money created always comes attached with interest. Without continual expansion of debt this system will implode. The continual expansion leads to asset bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:22:53
It should be government selling the unlimited supply, and citizens partaking of the limited ones.

He's a smart guy, but even smart people make mistakes. Isaac Newton missed out on a fortune investing in South Sea Company.

In my experience many smaller banks use ancient database systems e.g. Oracle RDB. On top of the DB they sometimes have java or c# wrappers, but often still use COBAL for core banking batches.

Tip. Sell when these same people are buying.
The more "It's a bubble" talk I hear, the less I think there is any bubble. Almost every bubble is only obvious to the masses in hindsight. 
Yes there's a few that call bubbles early, but they are typically an insignificant minority.

It's probably secure, but I wouldn't trust it.

If it took you that long to save $2,000 it seems like you have more pressing issues than buying Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:35:09
But how much is actually traded? Most markets are determined by a small fraction of trades in comparison to market cap. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:36:05
Via their fractional reserve fraud that has created generations of debt slaves? No, I hope banks don't finance stuff, why should banks determine where new money is allocated. They only end up creating asset bubbles, and misallocate resources.

Loaning Bitcoins is possible, but it doesn't increase the number of Bitcoins in circulation. On the other hand, borrowing dollars from a bank does increase the number of dollars in circulation. Banks essentially have the power to create new money via loans. This isn't possible with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:38:18

With Bitcoin you can't accidentally create 25 million dollars then send it. So we're not really comparing apples with apples by referencing mistaken Bitcoin transactions.

I think state back cryptocurrencies are a positive move forward if they're open enough to allow atomic swaps with better currencies (e.g. Bitcoin). At the very least they may eliminate the need for banks.

I worked in financial services company that had a bunch of Jamie Dimon type characters. Although they were obviously much less "successful" than Jamie, they were every bit as self-righteous. 
During a Christmas party somehow the conversation turned to Bitcoin when they almost simultaneously started belittling it and making predictions of its imminent demise. Lots of laughter all around.
Armed with a good knowledge of these idiot's, knowing their track record for losing customer's money. I knew anything they belittled needed further investigation. So I investigated Bitcoin for myself, and decided to buy some. It was about $180 USD back then. My only regret is not getting more.
 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:05:10
If you read their advice from a historic point of view, you'll almost always come to the conclusion that it was so low risk that it barely kept pace with inflation. 
Each up-vote in that thread is a vote for the most boring recommendation that won't make anything, but probably won't lose anything also.
The thing that gets me is their "diversification" strategies should at least include a small allocation of crypto currencies. Bitcoin probably being the safest. 
The most up-voted comment in the "I am 21, and I hold over $90,000 in bitcoin. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this money?"

In this market, there's more risk that you'd sell on what you assume is a final ATH, then it keeps going up. Not saying it will happen happen forever, but imagine selling now, thinking you'll get back in at $4,200, but instead it goes to $10,000 before correcting back to $6,500. 
Amateur traders are better off not buying more than they can afford to lose and holding tight. Encouraging day trading strategies is not wise.

I agree that loaning won't go away. But it will change, and it won't always remain as a means to create new money. 
There are too many fundamental problems with the current debt based monetary system for it to remain. Foremost is there will never be enough money to repay all the debt. This requires an ever expanding money supply just to service repayments. We now have future generations born into debt.

Bitcoin exchanges in various countries for the most part operate almost completely independent from other countries. There's a few exchanges that operate across multiple countries, but China's exchanges seem almost completely isolated due to capital controls.
Therefore the only real reason for a global price downtrend is psychological. Namely fear.

Risk doesn't justify an overly hostile stance toward Bitcoin. Risk is part of every investment strategy. Risk is part of life. There is no escaping risk, only ways to deal with it. 
It may also be risky not to have ANY Bitcoin. So rather than being immediately hostile on the subject, why not suggest it as an extremely minor allocation in a diversified portfolio. That would be a more rational approach. At the moment many posters on seem to make an immediate hostile/emotional response.

3 refers to how fiat currencies perpetually lose value by inflation. New fiat money is created by loans being taken out.

I have a relative who is bitter about Bitcoin.
This is their story. I told them about Bitcoin when it was a fraction of today's prices. They ignored what I said, and even went as far as saying it was a bit crazy to buy money "someone made up on the internet".
Fast forward a few years to late 2017. This same relative made a big announcement that they'd purchased a "whole Bitcoin" for $17,000 and they're not selling until it hits $100,000. 
Fast forward a few more months. I get a message from them "Hey, I need your advice on BTC. Do you think I should sell now. What would you do?". I replied with something along the lines that I never give financial advice.
A few days ago they told me they sold when it was $7,000 and they'll never touch it again because "It's a scam". And to be honest I hope they don't touch it again.

One of my major design gripes was how they hid the "deposit" functionality until after you're verified, but they don't tell you that part. I spent too long searching for how to deposit funds, and their support staff took about a week to respond.
A better approach would have been to show the button, but have a message stating that I need to be verified.
But to be honest their interface is scattered with usability issues. I only persevered with them because I wanted some BTC. It's a shame because it could have easily been a much better experience.

 1. They don't understand bitcoin (even when they say they do).

If crypto lending ever becomes a big thing it will most likely require that your identity is verified beyond any doubt. And I'm sure there will be safeguards built in that prevent you "using a different unknown wallet".
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:51:06


There's probably 1000s of ways that problem can be mitigated. Even in the unlikely situation of having one private key = ownership, it would still require legal process to evict someone. So the hacker would need to come forward in a court of law and explain how they obtained the keys.

Yes they do. They have the legal authority to issue new (digital) fiat. They can't do that with bitcoin.


I can't imagine a bank issued cryptocurrencies gaining any traction. It'd be worse than fiat.

As will "Loaning money, facilitating transactions, safe and insured custodianship" exist in different, distributed forms via crypto. Businesses that facilitate these blockchain functions probably won't be anything like today's banks, even if they use the term 'bank'. My main point is that banks will no longer be able to create money.

Banks would find it near impossible to generate the same revenue in the crypto space. Firstly they can't create crypto from nothing like the do with fiat. Secondly there will be a lot more competition.

Every bank that provides loans issues new currency. Even your local bank.


And look at the shit they're having now. The stable coins are a temporary measure to facilitate trading/speed problems. I can't imagine anyone actually uses them as a store of value, or for transactions. The problem is that they rely on the holder having complete faith in the company that issues them.

They're free to try that. However I don't see why anyone would value or trust those above bitcoin? Especially if they had central control, which of course the bank would insist upon. 


Those bank issued currencies were normally backed by precious metals or something of actual value. There have also been bank runs and failures. For centuries.

I agree. In many instances it would be nearly impossible to prove ownership.
