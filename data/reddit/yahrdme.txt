I’m holding out hope for iOS versions of Samourai and Sentinel ��

I see BTC/USD, BTC/EUR and BTC/GBP as options in GDAX but since I live in America, I can only use the BTC/USD option.

I ended up scanning the front and back of my license at 600dpi and I took a selfie with my phone of me holding the license and a piece of paper with my name and date on it. I continued to hammer support with emails and they finally verified my identity because I was unable to do it using the webcam method. Took me two months to have my identity verified.

Gyft.com maybe?

Don't worry about timing the market and don't sell unless you absolutely have to. Even with buying at different prices over the course of a month now, I'm still seeing about a 50% gain on my investment. 
I bought fractions of BTC when the price was as low as $2,200 and as high as $3,900. I just buy what I can when I can and I don't touch it. Transferring it out of my exchange and into a hardware wallet helps with discipline. I know I have the amount I have but I know it'll be better off to hold, or HODL.

Came here to say the same thing. I've made purchases using Purse and the experience has been great. No problems at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:47:37
Nice! I have about 1/3 of a BTC. I have a Trezor on the way this week. My goal is to have at least 1 BTC by the end of 2017. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:30:22
Nice! I'm close to 0.4 BTC. Working on getting to 1 or above but the value keeps going up! :) 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:46:53
You're actually verified on Coinbase?  Congrats to that, that's a feat in itself!
And congrats on the purchase. :)

I linked a bank account that's not on their list by setting up a wire for verification. The wire cost me $25 but Gemini reimbursed me $20 of that. I just used that $20 to buy Bitcoin. Once the wire is established, that allows both ACH and wire transfers into Gemini. 
From sending the wire to waiting for them to verify the deposit, it took maybe 4-5 days for everything to be set up.

Mine came from the same seller on Amazon and there was no evidence of any tampering. The box was sealed with the sticker and was definitely difficult to open due to all the glue. Also, the device itself looked brand new. It came with the small lanyard keychain, the other rope keychain to connect it to and four Trezor stickers. 
Edit: and of course the piece of paper to write your recovery seed on

I use Copay as a "spending" wallet for smaller amounts when I buy things from Amazon (through Purse.io) and I actually just got a Trezor this week. I'm using the Trezor for safe storage and discipline. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:27:47
I still haven't been verified on Coinbase. They haven't even addressed my ticket from a month ago. 
Meanwhile, Gemini and Kraken verified me in less than a week! 
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:31:03
Breadwallet or Copay. Both offer options to purchase BTC directly in the app. I prefer Copay, personally. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:13:47
I store most of my BTC on a Trezor but I'm also confident in the security provided by BitPay/Copay on iOS. My wallets are password secured and spending is also password secured. 
What I keep on my Trezor is what I plan on just saving and not spending. That's the main reason I have what I have on my Trezor.

Started it last night and have about 30 minutes left. For anyone that doesn't fully understand Bitcoin, it explains a lot of things in layman's terms. My wife had a general concept of Bitcoin and after watching a good portion of the documentary, she has a better understanding of it. She also asked me how and if she could start taking Bitcoin payments from her customers. ��

Worst experience: cashing out my close to 1 BTC when Circle stopped supporting Bitcoin. I should have sent it to another wallet and held onto it. Lesson learned.

My favorite mobile wallet is ArcBit. I can also watch the balance of my hardware wallet from ArcBit. Simple to use as well and their support is awesome. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:22:32
Have you looked at Gyft?
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:13:15
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:06:38
Ah, gotcha. That sucks! I’ve never used them before, I just know they occasionally offer discounts. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:28:55
You can also use ArcBit to watch your hardware wallet by using the xpub. I use ArcBit to watch the balance of my wallet on my Trezor.

Yeah, I’ve got some time today so it’s cool. 
Edit: took about 45-50 minutes. So glad that’s done! 
The part that made it hard: the tiles scattering during shipping so they weren’t all in their right section. A/E tiles scattered everywhere!

My Cryptosteel just came in yesterday. Looking forward to assembling today. :)

I was able to call a few weeks ago and they simply canceled the card while I was on the phone. I had less than a dollar left on it and they asked if I wanted to spend that before canceling. I told them to just go ahead and cancel it.

I finally got verified on Coinbase/GDAX about a week about after trying to get verified since July. I kept hammering support with notes on the case I had opened and they finally allowed for me to email them a high res scan of the front and back of my ID along with a selfie I took while holding my ID and a note that basically said "Coinbase.com, Case ID  mm/dd/yyyy." I continued to explain that my numerous verification attempts from my laptop and phone were failing even though I scanned my ID at 600dpi. 
It took another week after sending that but I finally received an email that I was verified. As soon as I was verified on Coinbase, I was able to access GDAX as well. 
Good luck and don't give up! 
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:45:10
Interesting. I may need to see if that’s the same case for my card. They gave me verbal confirmation of the card being canceled but nothing in writing. 
I’ll have to see if mine is truly canceled.

Just filled it out!

Sure! I also like that I can create a wallet in BitPay, import it into Copay and vice versa. I also like the open source nature of Copay. 
I also like how much quicker it is to import a wallet. I tested out removing and importing a test wallet into Breadwallet and importing the wallet took a really long time which was kind of concerning. I know Breadwallet is a pretty secure wallet, but BitPay/Copay are just easier to use in my opinion and I'm already fully accustomed to the UI.

Gemini 
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:47:21
Coinbase is the worst. I wanted to use CEX.io but it's not available where I live. I'm using Gemini and I like it a lot. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:41:06
Oh wow! Our experiences were like polar opposites. Interesting. From start to finish, I was ready on Gemini in less than a week. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:44:25
I've recently started using BitPay and feel pretty comfortable and confident in the security it provides. I created my default wallet with the 12 word recovery phrase and that's my "everyday spending" wallet so I don't keep a lot in it. 
I created a separate wallet for savings using the advanced option so that wallet has the 12 word recovery phrase but it also requires a really strong password. With that combination, I feel pretty confident in using that to store larger amounts. Right now I have around 0.22 BTC in it and as I continue purchasing from Gemini, I'm transferring out of the exchange and into that savings wallet. 
I also practiced a combination of removing and restoring my wallets from BitPay and Copay and had no issue with restoring them in any scenario, so I feel pretty confident about being able to retain my wallets if I ever upgrade my phone. 
My wallets are Touch ID protected and I get email alerts any time I transfer to or from my wallets. Also, Gemini has 2FA enabled so if someone did get my password to Gemini, I'd get an Authy notification. I also have to use Authy any time I transfer BTC out of Gemini and into one of my wallets. 
With all that said, I'm pretty confident in the overall security of using a phone-based wallet.

Coinbase failed to verify me and their support is horrendous. In the time I had a support case opened with them (that they never responded to), I was able to open a Gemini account, get verified and send a small wire transfer to establish ACH routing. They were so quick with everything! 
I closed the Coinbase account I never got to use as a result.
