When your H1-B visa is approved.

They're going to crash it to at least 5k is my guess.
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:43:16
...as it drops nearly 2,000 USD in value in the last month.

His loss, if true, is unfortunate...  However, BTC is never going to get beyond 20k.
Most people are too stupid to understand it.

These two are idiots.  Please stop posting their shit here.

Tom Lee's reputation is about to go down the toilet.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:04:39
Stop posting these idiots here.  Holy fuck they are are annoying.
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:53:17
Why are ~half of your posts in bold face?  Is it because you just learned how to do it?
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:59:21
Huh?  A Redditor for 3 weeks who has less than .1 bitcoin trying to argue with someone who has been here for years.
Get your head out of your ass.  Smart people don't keep using the same account here so stop parroting shit your read, idiot.

I've been here for 5 years...  Guess how much I have.  I assure you it's more than you, genius.
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:30:38
How is this ever going to work if every time the valuation goes up a couple hundred USD some douchebag pushes it back down?  This is manipulated like a motherfucker.
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:01:19
You made me laugh.
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:25:30
These two are fucking annoying.  Watch their other videos. Why is this being upvoted?

McAfee should just eat his dick when his June forecast fails instead of dragging it on 2.5 years.  Dude is bat shit crazy and has no idea what he is is talking about.
He founded a company almost nobody gives a shit about at this point.  
He is irrelevant and is attempting to stay relevant by making ridiculous claims.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:54:23
It's never going to happen.  If you think "the powers that be" will ever allow it to happen, you are delusional.
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:55:14
Definitely no manipulation going on.
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:53:11
It's "per se."  Don't try to sound more intelligent than you are.  You'll more than likely end up looking foolish as is the case here.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:40:12
He is absolutely correct..
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:55:04
Are you OK?  You seem to not be able to write sentences in proper English.  Also, your caps lock key seems to be stuck.

What happens when McAfee is wrong about his June prediction?  Does he eat a ball/nutt?  Do people stop listening to him because he's crazy?
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:57:47
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:54:03
I understand.  It was a joke.
We all know he is insane and his predictions are ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:43:40
Will McAfee rescind his 1 million dollar dick eating projection after his June 15k USD projection doesn't happen? ;)
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:18:29
Your .1 BTC will never make you rich.
The people who hold most of the bitcoin are controlling things.
Edit:  Perhaps once companies realize they can save billions that may change...  
The people fucking with things read everything here...

Why is this loser reposting shit already on the front page to promote his site?
@_date: 2018-06-01 10:25:15
The exact same fucking post is 8 posts below yours.  You got a notice and still reposted it.  
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:37:31
This isn't Twitter.  Why are you using hashtags?
@_date: 2018-06-05 12:42:14
This is just another repost of an article someone else wrote by a person who wants clicks.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:01:51
Are you fucking kidding me?  These Asian assholes need to go away.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:12:34
What is McAfee going to eat when his 15k June prediction is wrong?
