If you do a market buy/sell, it's 0.25%, if you do a limit you're going to likely be at 0.15%.
Remember, this is fractions of a percent, 0.25% of $100 is $0.25. It wouldn't be worth the hassle to me to do another round of KYC bullshit to save a nickle at another exchange.

Stalin killed a hell of a lot more people than Hitler but if you ask anyone who the worst person of the 20th century is, most are going to say Hitler and the other 3% of millennials will say George W Bush even though he wasn't president in the 20th century.

One of the banks I use has something that's automagically attached to a Visa debit card. If that card number changes,  a merchant with a previous authorization somehow gets the ability to charge the new card number without you saying a thing about it. It took going to the branch and telling them I'm not giving them the new number yet they continue to charge it. The manager came out and told me about this "service" which I promptly had disabled on my account.

No amount of hodling or refusing to spend BTC is going to "change the world". If you never spend what you have then no one else can grasp that its used as a currency rather than simply another stock/bond to hold for change in value before liquidating the asset for either fiat or real property.

Meanwhile they're in mom's basement watching their blood pressure spike from the sodium content of the amount of ramen they eat knowing good and well they'll die from heart disease long before Bitcoin becomes the actual mainstream currency used around the world.

The more hassle it is to keep large sums of money on hand, the more likely someone (not a crypto person) would keep in the bank. That of course makes it so much easier to tax/garnish/steal your assets. The majority of ATM machines out there give out $20s and sometimes $50s. Keeping large sums of currency can get unmanagable for Joe Average who also doesn't have a proper UL-listed security container.
I find it a hassle to have more than 10 bills in my wallet, managing a large sum of money without large denomination bills is just a hassle of binder clips or rubber bands.

TIL that despite "banks halted lending" in 2008, I somehow still got a mortgage. I suppose this makes me a unicorn.

Bots and ledger orders will take care of rekking the market long before you would have the 30 extra seconds to login and make the sell.
Either hold your keys or don't but the reason you want to leave your coin on the exchange is illogical.
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:27:03
So instead of just cashing it out on the Exchange, they're going to foot the tax payers with the commission of the auction, the process to do it, all while patting themselves on their blueline backs about how great they are at their job?

That TL;DR is 100% correct, no fucking shit Sherlock!
Until the IRS gets rid of the horseshit they put people through for holding crypto it won't go anywhere. This is the one smoking gun that the USG will continue to force the dollar down our throats for many years to come.

What part about taxation is theft does your pea-sized little brain not understand?
@_date: 2019-09-06 14:27:00
Equivalent of 8 pallets of $100 bills stacked 48" high and coming in at about 22,000 pounds in weight. The $700 wouldn't even cover it being driven one block from the bank after you factor in security and insurance.

Most banks charge for a wire transfer, it’s the equivalent of a cash payment sent around the world and it’s not reversible. 
Next time plan to make a payment on-time instead of bashing a (terrible) bank for being (more) terrible. 
Bitcoin will not solve your problem with responsibility.

Don't forget: fights, stabbing, rape, bad food, poor conditions.
The smell of a jail would make most people's stomachs churn. It's a combination of body odor, rotting teeth, and dirty ass.
Despite Bitcoin's colors being orange, it is certainly not the new black.

Nope, sorry, I pay about $3000 a month in state and federal taxes as a single person. Don’t begin to talk to me about “MUH ROADS”

It never ceases to amaze me how much the ATMs inflate the price and here I thought the US Government was the only one competent enough to take 25% of someone's money without getting anything back from it.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:02:26
You’d see such a buy up if it dipped even down to $2-3k the demand and price would soar.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:49:20
Yep I saw that too.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:02:24
In both scenarios, if the government doesn't know you have it, they can't get it. The point is not letting someone know you have it at all.
Just because you won't turn over your wallet doesn't mean they have plenty of ways to get it. Hold you in contempt of court until you give over the recovery phrase. Put a lien on the property that you do have based upon the amount they "feel" that you owe based upon when they guess that you acquired the crypto.

Thank you for the reassurance. Just waiting on my initial deposit to clear Coinbase before I buy and it seems like an eternity.

If and when it becomes “easy” for the common joe to buy/sell without paying taxes on it then you better believe they’ll find a way to restrict it.

I love the ones that are hodl and I'm never selling ever. These are the same ones living in a shitty $800 1 bedroom apartment, have a 12 year old car on it's last leg, tons of unpaid student loans and still gets a hot 'n ready delivered from their mom at least twice a week.
By all means, continue to hodl!

I'm going with a virtual machine in ESXi without a NIC. This way I can use Veeam to back it up and store encrypted off-site if I ever have a failure with my disk array.
I've seen far too many USB sticks crap out for no reason.

Did you ever consider some kind of a live ticker for your home/office/where ever? I’ve been thinking a Raspberry Pi or similar that updates from one of the exchanges and displays it like a clock.

If your CPA isn’t able to handle the results on your trades then he sure as to hell doesn’t need to be doing taxes. 
That’s like asking a surgeon if he’s comfortable removing an appendix.
