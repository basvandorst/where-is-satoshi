RemindMe! 2 days "Did this solution work?"
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:28:29
Sorry: 
Bitcoin Core version v0.15.1
Armory 0.96
Core is synced but Armory is crashing after scanning block  or  or 47 ...ETC.
The block it crashes on differs every time.
Error is:"raw data does not match expected block hash"
Ex. [Picture](
