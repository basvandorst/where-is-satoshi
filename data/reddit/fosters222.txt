i full understand, how it works and the System but if i buy BTC at a higher rate then  i can sell them for i lose money . right now the Chinese BTC or just in the Chinese market for BTC is lower then Mtgox . so i can't send them to china. without losing money ...

man i hope so...after all that has happened lately.. this would be really nice . 
@_date: 2013-05-25 02:59:57
Wait just had an idea, what if i could buy Chinese BTC then i wouldn't have to worry about the 30 point Yuan problem .. but now the problem is getting Chinese BTC ....

i smell chinese 2nd hand junk site...been seeing these pop up , they sell knock off goods, but say they are just like the real thing... look how many Ads the site has ...

Yes that Option would Rock! if Ebay, Lets you do it id say wait for them to open it up, i think it would be soon... also Paypal has been looking at adding it.

True, but i highly doubt a huge company is going to do it ...without others going first...Sony isn't first to do anything... 
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:53:46
Good point....I myself can buy BTC Easy , but others cant give me money Easy! haha

this thing has been up for 19 hrs and no one has tested it!??? ill check back later... but yes looks to good to be true...but if the site doesn't take a cut then they are not making profit..so it would be a person to person trade ....hmm i guess the site could go for AD money or something ...so many questions so little posts on this thing ...i take that back buyers of the BTCs need to pay 2% i dont know....not trusting this shit ..

BTC Prices do go up and down alot..but if people are selling btc for cash and making a small profit why don't they just buy more btc...

The Problem isn't being able to get BTC in USD or the Vendor not taking the BTC it's the Rate of Yuan to BTC that is killng me right now. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 17:34:00
always going to end up paying tax, Even if we all used BTC and no one used credit cards we still pay Tax....just in BTC tax... Ga Station...sales Tax...get a Job payroll tax...
