Oh, it’s *this* thread again.  Glad I didn’t listen to this shit at $1k,  $2k,  $3k,  $5k,  that I held from $8k down to 4800 again, that I held through the “bubble” at $11k-13k and up to $19500.  Yeah it dropped again to 10k.  Anyway.  Here I am.  Reading all this shit and still here.  One day I won’t be I suppose.  But fuck it if reading this shit means anything.

My worry is that with those operations shutting down, the mining cost may lower and the miners will sell their mined coins for less, but I don’t think that’s really true.  Hard to know the economics and how it affects things

I just transferred what would normally be a bank transfer and take 3-5 days and have a larger fee than the .0016% (compared to the transaction amount). I just paid.  I freakin love bitcoin.
To answer your question, no I wouldn’t wait 2 hrs and pay more.  To say that’s the only way it works isn’t really true.

Yawn.  Maybe “right now” but Bcash has no dev team and no scaling solution other than bigger blocks.  It’s incomplete and just bullshit for the short term I want it right now crowd.  Btc is the I want a robust community with a great dev team and future features.   There is a tremendous difference, I agree.

“Removing a large portion of the network will also slow the number of new bitcoins mined, causing a shortage of supply that in turn will likely result in another surge in price — which currently sits at around $15,500.”

Is it not a problem that the whole energy used in mining actual gold and silver, creating the printing presses to make paper currency, the amount of energy to drive all the trucks, weight of the money, the energy to power all the lights and heat in all the banks.... etc etc.  is an enormous amount?

It totally does.  When you sign up for 2fa there should be a manual code and a QR code.  I never use the QR code.  I always write down the manual code, type in the manual code off the price of paper I wrote it on, then enter the test code to see if it worked.  I wouldn’t recommend taking a screen shot.
Once you know the manual entry code works you have your back up and nothing to worry about.

Exactly.  Libya was sparked by the CIA’s Arab spring.  Syria was sparked by the invasion of iraq and creation of ISIS due to us having no idea wtf the true consequences were.  Yemen Houthis are fighting for their rights against an oppressive USA Military backed Saudi Arabia.  All of this shit goes back to the 40s and in the 70s installing puppet dictators.  It’s all about oil.  And it’s all fucked!  We shouldn’t even *be* there!  Oh wait, Halliburton needs a payout!  Hold on, let’s install a puppet named George W Bush, the biggest retard on the planet.

I’m not going to tell you the specifics of the transfer because you’re a redditor for 3 weeks and therefore an asshole.
I paid $14 to move funds from one country to another and totaled .0016% of the total amount sent.  That person can now use bitcoin in his own currency (no currency exchange fee) and it happened at 11:30 at night my time 8:30am his time. 
Find me a bank that can do that for less of a fee at that time of day across borders.
I think you’re so made because you are a Bcash shill.  But you don’t care what I think, and that’s fine.  I don’t care what you think either making me explain myself.  I’m *not* lying if that’s what you’re getting at.

“Illegally” MDMA changed me.
I was severely depressed since 7th grade, it followed me into my 20’s and I still feel it today.  Taking MDMA at the age of 24 “showed” me what it meant to feel good, what it meant to feel true love, and what it meant, despite the shit in our lives that ultimatley directs us and affects us to do things we normally wouldn’t, isn’t our fault.  It’s not my dads fault, it’s not my moms fault, it’s not my fault, it’s no ones fault.  Coming to the base of our human core, outside our blinders, outside the effects/affects our feelings sway or have on us was eye opening.  I still feel shitty as ever, but I now have perspective and “the knowledge.”
Every fucking person on this planet should take some MDMA or LSD/shrooms.  It’s important.  I did it 6 times total and that was enough.  I got “what I needed” from it as you so often hear is the case from people, and I steered clear of becoming bound to the drug in a negative way.  
The terrible laws that put we humans in bondage are so fucking fucked up.  I believe in bitcoin for the freedom and the person to person transactions it allows.  I believe in this trial from anecdotal, personal experience.
Good for you guys, keep it up.  No human has he answers and in our hubris we create suffering.  Allow people the freedom to direct their lives.  Allow the strength to return to our population.  Yes, your capitalism thrives on mindless drones, yes, when I breaks down or the “choice” is offered, we fail.  No, it’s not a reason to marginalize those same people.  
No one will do it for us, we need to take control of our lives again.  Bitcoin is my dream, yet not my endgame.  Bitcoin is the evolution, many many more things need to keep happening.  It all starts somewhere.  These MDMA trials are not trivial even if totally dissociated form and have nothing to do with bitcoin.

Underrated post of bitcoin since the dawn of its inception.  The fucking *dollar* *is* the terrorist.
The only fucking reason we went to war with Iraq, spawned ISIS, the mass refugee crisis to Europe and resulting fucking quagmire is because fucking Saddam Hussein wanted to change from the dollar to the euro because he was tired of our shit.  God damnit... how many people had to lose their lives because the FED and the republicans and the fucking war industry needed a new summer home and a tesla.  Fuck them.
Bitcoin is freedom.  Bitcoin is outside that.  Bitcoin is one small glimmer of hope that humans can actually use and affect policy with.  Through free market and the unassailable core that bitcoin represents, humans can interact person to person for value anywhere, any time.  (other than voting which also is just a manufactured “choice” with no bearing on what actually goes down in government and hardly has any effect).
Bitcoin is fucking amazing.  And beyond the alts and shills and whatever else, I started in bitcoin for this.  This message.

The whole war was manufactured by the republicans and defense industries who align with them.  7000 killed, 100,000 wounded 650,000 Iraqis dead it goes on and on,  trillions spent on a war that if we didn’t go to would have been able to cover all college and all healthcare for our whole nation until 2030.  To me, that’s better national security than spending $50,000 per dead “terrorist.”  It’s all a scam.  Fuck them.  Let them stay there.  No, Arab spring had to happen.  Syria refugees had to be released in to Europe.  We fucked up so bad by stirring that pot and we will pay for it for generations.  Ever since we started dividing shit up and manipulating the area because it had oil.  God damn.  Renewables should be prioritized.  Our environment should be prioritized.  Our people should be.

Some people at the end of the year realize what their tax obligation is from all the trades they have done that year and want to make sure they can pay it.  Say, you made $50k capital gains day trading but still all of that is “on paper.”  Well, if everything goes to zero, you still owe that money to the gov.  People at the end of the year sell the appropriate amount of their assets to ensure they have the fiat to pay Uncle Sam and let the rest ride.  
Me for example, I received and traded forked coins this year and simply added that to my bitcoin holdings.  I owe taxes on that but don’t have the cash right now to pay that obligation.  I needed to sell some bitcoin at the end of the year once I knew my exact tax obligation otherwise I open myself up to being chased by the IRS forever.

In those countries, bitcoin is the only stable thing they have and the only thing the government can’t control except in the way of a “ban.”  Where, yes, the government is trying to control you and your money, they are failing so you are trying to survive and use bitcoin but now you’re a criminal for just trying to live.  At the heart of that idea is a profound value of bitcoin.  As long as the coins can be exchanged for money or ideally, goods and services person to person in those countries, bitcoin has a very real use as a stop gap/safety net for someone who stored some of their money in bitcoin.
It stated that the transaction cost is $30.  That’s a recent development and a result of popularity and growing pains.  Bitcoin is an evolving technology and a victim of its own bubble/success (whatever you want to call it).  Bitcoins transactions used to be pennies, and hopefully soon that will be solved, to say $30 in a way that to me implied it was forever this way and will continue to be this way did a disservice to the uneducated reader.  The same person you are trying to teach, you are swaying with a bias, in my own opinion.
All these crypto currencies have their own uses and I understand why you say only one can reign. But I believe there are many coins for many uses and some will create their own markets and that many coins can exist and compete and/or exist and have no affect on one another.  I think we don’t even know what great uses can come from this, but in that statement I digress.
And the final thing I wanted to point out, is that any good investment portfolio has diversity.  If you put 5% of your portfolio in “risky” investments, then bitcoin or any other crypto coin is great.  Don’t say all or nothing on this one.... even if you bought that overpriced Dell share, it would still be worth way more today and you are probably happy��.

Dude... blockfolio *used to* be amazing.  Lately... I’m just lagging out and “attempting g to connect to server” etc.  when it works it’s great, but have a back up.  I think it’s getting too popular, and just like bitcoin, they are having growing pains.
The new thing.... not the “web” or “networking” it’s being faster at dealing with growing pains.
What’s the algorithm of dealing with growing pains.  It’s the next “new thing.”  How can I bring a product to market and be able to most cost effectively deal with its growth... however fast or slow it goes, and be able to adapt to that growth, small or large, on a moments notice without being inefficient in implementation, either on the front end (perhaps by hiring too many staff) or on the back end, not hiring enough and having to deal with $$$ outside contractors.

Well, I wouldn’t do it naked.  Buy the two bitcoin you want, and sell a short position against those two bitcoin.  You only stand to lose those two bitcoin and you possibly can make exactly the amount if it drops.  If it goes up, you’ll miss out, but at least you won’t *owe* anyone anything other than the gut wrenching moment you have to give up your two coins that are worth $$$.
I’m sure you know how it works.  But shorting bitcoin naked is just utter madness.

Dude.  In this particular instance, do not buy her out.  Tell the judge that you are ready to send 1/2 of the bitcoin to another wallet of her choosing.  That way, no matter the value at the time of arbitration or whatever, you don’t get fucked.  Don’t let them say “oh, the bitcoin was worth “X” amount at this point in time.  Just say, that she can get 1/2 your bitcoin at whatever point the trade happens.  Don’t let them say you owe her dollars or whatever the currency is you use.  That’s the only way to be sure you’re splitting it evenly and you are not getting fked.  Except for the transaction fee on the block chain, this shouldn’t be that big of a deal.

Here is a follow up question to that regarding forks: 
What do I tell the IRS for when I received 1 bitcoin cash on xx/xx/2017 date and time and supposedly “worth $650” and couldn’t sell for 6 days and finally was able to sell for 1 bitcoin which on that day, on that exchange that 1 bitcoin was worth $400. 
How do I report *that.*
My *guess* is that, no matter when I was able to sell my BCH, I still received this amount on this day and have to pay income tax on that and that price/value for that day.    When I sold it 6 days later after it had dropped in price 30% or so to the $400 level.  Then I still get a $250 capital gains tax loss contribution to my net capital gains vs losses net amount.  
Kinda shitty in my opinion, but hey, at least it’s something.  And if that’s what I gotta do that’s what I gotta do.

Just like right now, the fee is user selectable.  If the amount of fees dictated by the people are too low, the miners won’t mine, if they are too high the people won’t transact.  And all of this is modified by the mining difficulty too.  Don’t worry about it.  The 21 millionth bitcoin won’t be mind for more than 100 years.

I tried to tel him about bitcoin, what it means to me, how it’s a way I feel like I can “vote” (or at least let the free market work in the face of an ever increasingly unfair system) I said I believed in the premise of a globally valued currency.  No exchange rates, just bitcoin for goods.  Easy as that.  No banker charging exchange rates or interest on money that isn’t theirs.  I kept going on but he just kept hearing the same thing and we ended up agreeing that I won’t sell it.  I *want* to use bitcoin.  I will when I can. I hodl until then.

You bring up a good point, and you touch on the subject of “scaling” whether you know it or not.  Bitcoin is constantly being developed and various “developments” have turned in to their own forks.  Bitcoin cash, bitcoin ultimate, bitcoin gold, etc.  these are all branches to attempt to implement scaling and accessibility and features in their own ways.  The problem is adoption.  Bitcoin was fine for a long time.  Then bitcoin became a victim of its own success.  The problems with scaling came quick and now people are trying to implement different improvements.  Who will win we will never know and who will be “best” only time will tell.  Some people say bitcoin cash and say bitcoin core is being controlled by American banks now through the upcoming lightning network, some say the opposite and that BCH is being controlled by the Chinese in an unfair mining method.  
It is changing, keep your eyes open and keep reading.  Many other “coins” would have the same problems that bitcoin core is having right now if they too had the sudden surge in popularity.  It’s a process, and change isn’t as instant as the security and robustness of testing it can keep up.

Yes. Hardware wallets allow very easy access to your coins and keep them safe in your own possession.  The problem with leaving your coins on an exchange is that the exchange may fail, it might be down for maintenance, etc.  and you don’t want to lose control of your money like that.  There are a few drawbacks to a hardware wallet.  The problem with hardware wallets is that your coins are not “on” the exchange and therefore selling cannot be don’t quickly.   First you need to send your coins from a hardware wallet to an exchange (waiting for x amount of confirmations) and then sell them.  Or use your hardware wallet to directly pay someone.  The security of the hardware wallet is 100% in your own hands, but it’s ultimately the way to go.  I personally have felt very nervous using the hardware wallet, but after testing it out with very small transactions, i now have piece of mind that my coins are safe and in my control.  Some people prefer leaving that in the hands of the exchange and no one here will support that or tell you to do that.  For the price, a Trezor or ledger nano-s is the only hardware wallet I would consider and I recommend you buy either one right now.


Coinbase, like all other exchanges do not run on the same price because of buys/sells that take place on each exchange differently.  One thing to know is, if you believe they are misrepresenting the price, is that it goes both ways.  If you think they are ripping you off on the “buy” price and asking too much? Well then a seller will get the same price and jump for joy.  It goes both ways and I don’t think they fix the prices.  The only place they “get you” is in their company’s convenience/transaction fee which is additive to the normal bitcoin fee.  It’s a fee that GDAX doesn’t have/is less and varies from exchange to exchange.   Supposedly for that fee you can get the Coinbase vault to cold store and protect your coins and do other various things like have a convenient app to use, so you are paying for that definitely but I don’t think they are scamming anyone if those people read the fee structure etc.

Greed over humanity...then after they fucked us, they coddled the governments balls to make US (taxpayers) pay (bailout) THEM (banks) as they were still dripping wet from ramming us in the ass.  2010 was about the time I started believing in bitcoin.  Too bad I didn’t have more than $250 to my name at the time.  Granted the banks “did” pay all that money back, but what about all the people who lost their homes to foreclosure by being convinced by a salesperson from the bank that the house values were in no way inflated and the magic printer money they injected in to the stocks and commodity exchanges wasn’t artificially raising prices about the actual value.

When you “get” your bitcoin cash you need to declare that as income.  You earned $3000 and pay whatever your normal income tax on that is.  Now, the argument is still true, what if you didn’t claim your bitcoin cash and sold your bitcoins and never had access to them? Then I guess that’s fine if you hold to it.  But say, in 5 years your bitcoin cash is worth more and you claim it then?  You owe back taxes and interest for the last 5 years.
I think on this one, if you never claimed your bitcoin cash and don’t want anything to do with it, and you never “received” it or spent/sent/or did anything else with it, you don’t need to do anything.  
It’s tough.  There’s also a rule that you cannot have undeclared crypto and this would kind of be against that law too if you don’t pay taxes on it now but claim it later. 
In my case, I did receive bitcoin cash and claimed it and sold it immediately.  I have negligible capital gains on that when I did the claim and sell and claim it as normal income for the year.  I’m going to review this with my CPA.  I used to do my own taxes but this year, even though I have good records of all my trades, I’m going back to her.  She’s a wizard with this shit.

I would be really interested to look at the up/down peaks/lows and see if bitcoin follows this in some way.  I feel like in the last year it has gotten to these levels and then dropped to their prior number of “support.”  It’s a curious number set.  It’s probably all coincidental, but check out

I understand what you are saying, but if you “invested” only the money you were ready to lose, and genuinely care about the bitcoin ecosystem and genuinely are interested in using bitcoin in your day to day life, you can still do that without worrying about the price.  In my opinion.  At least, that’s where I am at right now.  I joined for the same reasons your highlighted and now just am as curious as you.  The price is ridiculous in my opinion, but I can see both sides.  Either way, I can keep a diversified portfolio with bitcoin and you should too.  Don’t go all in, but don’t go all “out” either bruh!

I hear where you’re coming from, but as a dude who heard about and *wanted* it to succeed and *wanted* to buy in in 2010/11 when it was $60/btc but didn’t because I had $250 to my name... I just couldn’t do it.  Coming from me, I finally got “in” early this year based on principle.  I want bitcoin to be available, I sympathize with my family who got crushed in the 2008 crash and only after seeing it happen and watching “The Big Short” four times, did I *really* understand what it was all about so many years later.  Bitcoin simplifies things.  My favorite quote from Bill Murray is in the movie “The Life Aquatic” where they are talking about a similar thing.  His wife speaks all this accounting jargon and with baited lips says, seductively “you understand, don’t you honey” and he replies “no, I don’t understand, but I can tell it’s BULLSHIT!”
That’s the same with me.  All these derivatives, bets on top of bets with the same money, etc. etc. is all so fucking flimsy.  This subs meme about monopoly rule is true.  “If the bank runs out of money *dont worry*!! Just write down the debts on a price of paper and when the bank finally becomes solvent, then trade those papers for the “real” cash.   
It’s so fucking flimsy.  Bitcoin will always have value because I personally GIVE it value.  A person like me tired of the bullshit and manipulations.  “Hmmmm how much can we fuck with people and interest rates to extract the maximum we can from them while still not causing a revolt...  well... I’m not the revolutionary type... I’m not going to set up a gun sale in the mountains and wage a war, but I am an honest hard working American who is tired of the BS the owners of this country are pulling.  Totally devoid of anything other than their own interests and *nothing* to do with our constitution.  And even at that, I believe in the constitution of humanity and global cooperation.
I buy bitcoin to say, “hey, banker, it’s fine if I need a loan or whatever, I will pay your fee, but for transferring money, paying for goods, going about my daily life? I don’t need you anymore, and the price you charge for your services is no longer needed.  No hard feelings, I *choose* the alternative... just like anyone who has Comcast but no other option wishes.  Comcast blows dick and if you are bound to them I’m sorry.  Now that there is competition in my area I have switched to fiber....obviously.  *THAT* is what bitcoin is to me.  Fiber optic internet compared to bullshit Comcast.  
True, now that it’s popular, bitcoin has its growing pains, but I personally have used it already and see their scaling plan and agree that it is a place I want to be and place my money in it.
That’s bitcoins baby.  ...Oh yeah, and the price is nice too.

It’s hard!  Prior to the bitcoin growth this year, this space was filled with information and eager users building a project.  People shared good info, helped each other, and one out of ten threads *if that* was a price thread.  Now it has one good post for every ten price threads.  Which is fine, (or not depending on your perspective), but to make my point, it’s harder to find good info on here among all the newbies and people just here to make money.
Thankfully, bitcoin is very straightforward.  I wish I could tell you a great place to start, but I learned “along the way” and probably couldn’t tell you where all I have gone.  Hang out here, but my best advice, is to search for information and keep asking questions here.  People here have helped me out a lot and I think you will find the same.

Bitcoin was absolutely fine.  Then it got suddenly so much more popular so quickly, faster than anyone expected, and is having growing pains.  I think this is just a step in the path to bitcoin being what it is meant to be.
Imagine a flower shop selling 5 flowers a day for 2 years.  Then in one year people buy 40 flowers a day and the lines are long and the old customers are all mad that the shop “isn’t” what it used to be.  The shop starts construction to expand in a meaningful way and after another year of craziness the shop can now deal with demand and be the same shop the original people remember.  How good it was and how short the wait times were.  
That’s my analogy for all this.  The construction/expansion is happening, the demand is though the roof, and these growing pains will all be for the better soon enough.

If you call your friend up is he going to pay up?  Maybe you keep what you would owe in taxes and only give him $60 instead of $95.  Is he aware and happy with that?

4chan was when I was first introduced to bitcoin in 2010.  I was super depressed, saw through the bullshit of this manufactures world and was looking for something more real.

When I saw it again earlier this year and looking for a purpose of my money other than a fucking vanguard fund, bitcoin was my freedom.  My existential fuck you to the created world.

I want the crash.  $1200 a coin right now? Shiet.  I was saying that when it was $60 a coin though.  So far it's been a good ride though.   But still... you keep hitting these milestones, that in any other investment would be cause to sell... but damn.  Bitcoin is an enigma.  Anything, and I mean ANYTHING is possible.  Lately I've been feeling my 6 coins from $800 land should be sold, but I also have this idea that it might go moon.  Right now I want a crash just to buy more, but I'm not buying more at $1200... even though I'm hoping for moon, this would still be a good investment.  It's friggen mind boggling!  85% of me says the recent uptick are just a conglomerate of holders and not people using the bitcoin to purchase.  It's all speculation.... the price is super speculative and to get out is probably what is best.  At the same time, bitcoin is an enigma and the moon is possible.  So hard.  Since my goal is the "invest what you don't mind losing" strategy, I'm not buying more or less and just hodling my 6 coins that already have doubled in value.  I'm gonna kick myself so hard though if it goes moon.

I'm so confused on this.  If I have 1 bitcoin I bought for $500 and now it's worth $1000 but all along I've been spending coin as the price has moved up and down how the fk do I figure that out and put it on my taxes as capital gains.  I mean, if the dollar goes down or up, I just keep spending without thinking that i have any capital gains or losses to report on my bank account...
Go to the IRS and be like, the Federal Reserve or whoever printed too much money and now my dollar is worth 5% less than compared to the euro, I have 5% capital gains tax losses.  I'm sure it doesn't work like that.  But for bitcoin it seemingly does.  And that's making mah head spin right now thinking about it and the implications.

Negative rates encourage you to say “screw this! I’m taking my money OUT of the bank and buy stocks!”
The negative rates are pushing people to put money in to the volatile market and artificially keep it afloat by convincing/forcing people to put more money in to the system....  right before the inevitable crash and these people lose everything.  
Even the national debt is just stealing a-la inflation and making debts “cheaper” to pay off over time.
If I were you and negative rates were a thing I would KEEP my money in the bank.  Shit is going down and having no return (maybe even a slight loss) is better than losing all your shit.
This is a scam by the national banks to encourage taking money out of solid savings to pump a fucked world market about to “correct.”  ... and in this method, at the expense of the normal person.

I only invested what I am prepared to lose.  I am happy with my gains, but the longer and longer I keep it the more utility I see it having and the more it's inherent value increases in my own mind.  Since I have invested the money I am prepared to lose, I suppose I could "cash out" for the initial investment back and still have bitcoin to go forward with, but really, like I said, the longer I hold, the more I think that when the time comes, to change btc to fiat, I won't have to.  I'm more and more happy with bitcoin as days go by.  Been watching for 4 years, been hodling for 11 months now and in to the foreseeable future.

Yeah, the baby boomers riding the wave of industrial and agricultural success The Greatest Generation before them gave them, handing them everything, now in their hubris also expect the younger generation to keep handing them things they they should have taken care of on their own.  Now it falls on the young to continue supporting social security (as was intended by its ponzu scheme-esque set up) their cherished lives.  The difference this time is after they are done paying in to it, there will be nothing left.  The booomers baby.  The booooooomers.  The ones handing us a financial meltdown, the most stagnant wages while costs increase.  It's just awesome and every young person is "lazy."  It's like, no motherfucker, just because I don't want to play your rigged game doesn't mean *I'm* the lazy one. I'm ready to live my life and be active, but it's so depressing.
They couldn't save for themselves and they couldn't get the government to save either. 
Im not mad tho, I'm just gonna do my own thing and save my money and not rely on anyone.  Like they all are now.  I'm learning to not trust the government or people and just make sure I take care of myself and save what I can and be a good person.  What else is there.

It's comparing bitcoin to banks in a way that assumes control and the same standards we are used to.  I'm trying to dissociate the utility that bitcon offers from the status quo we are used to.  It's money, yeah, but just as barter trading 4 apples for 1 goose is "stupid" and "no body does that anymore", it's just as different of a comparison between bitcoin and savings accounts.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:30:26
All good info, but also, too much comparing/talking about fiat.  When the time comes, hopefully, I won't have to compare fiat to bitcoin.  I'll just spend my bitcoin for goods straight up.  No exchange rate, no extra hands in the pot, just straight up market value for bitcoin whether I'm in USA, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, wherever.  Just cut the banksters out of it all and then you will be even more enlightened with your discovery and excitement for what the potential future of bitcoin holds

I'm trying.  Obamacare to me, is at least the system giving something back to me that I am paying in to that is positive.  I have family in Germany, and they tell me instead of spending money of war they learned their lesson and spend those tax dollars on "free" college education.  It's the society investing in their own future rather than creating slaves of their new young adults.  The war in Afghanistan was just, but going in to Iraq was crazy.  That war along could have funded Obamacare and college for everyone. 1.7 trillion dollars... for what.  Halliburton? We were all lied to there that's for sure.  At least let me get something *back* for my money instead of blowing up some goat farmer in the desert with a $50,000 missile.  Anyway.  I'm not really mad at the boomers, I think that's a bit of a scapegoat, but damn, shit sure ain't what it used to be.  I bet some people blame the republicans, and some blame the democrats, but it doesn't matter which of those two "sides" your on, the same shit goes down in Washington in the same ways, but for different shit.

Why buy anything? Just save it all and invest all your money in the stock market because it will go up.  Year over year, including down turns, the market general index funds average a 7% return.  
People *do* need to buy things, and people are buying things.  People are getting their whole paychecks in bitcoin, people are buying pizzas for $1.5 million.  It's all happening, just not as widespread as it will be in the future as bitcoin build report with the masses.

Because it's not just related to the dollar.  It's a global currency with global purchasing power.  Look at Venezuela.  If you were comparing it to the bolivar for example, and not the dollar, that train wreck of a currency eliminated a whole country's savings.  
Bitcoin is taking its place as something different than fiat and you are thinking of it as fiat.  This seems similar, but bitcoin is just two people bartering in a fair global way, outside the influence of any bank/manipulator etc.
Bitcoin is just the currency of the future, forget the dollar, forget the bolivar, there is no bitcoin without selling fiat though, that's still the method of "getting in" to bitcoin.  The only time it starts taking away purchasing power is when people, and I mean a LOT of people start wanting bitcoin more than they want dollars.  Just like me, already. 
I'm not stupid, I have my idealistic view of bitcoin and what I want it to be, and in 5 years time it might/will be something totally different.  I only invested "what I'm ready to lose." Etc.
The answer to your question is this.  Once people stop dumping fiat for bitcoin, and once people stop wanting fiat, we will have arrived, where you don't have to exchange bitcoin for fiat.  Then it will be its own thing, then, the government will crack down since they are losing control.  It's a ways away, but that's when I think what you speak of will happen.  When bitcoin starts taking away purchasing power from fiat is when people stop wanting to use fiat in favor of bitcoin.

I'm 32 and 30% in Index And 30% in meme stocks 20% cash.  5% in bitcoin which now became 20% in the last 7 months.... I'm kinda baffled of what to do.  
I'm lucky.  But unlucky in knowing what to do next.  I'll be fine if my btc goes back to zero, but I will definitely wish I sold now rather than later... I'm at a point of profit I would be thrilled with any other time. I sold my jihan coin at $400 as it was dripping from $700 to $190.  I was so smug that I "made the right play."  Now Jihan ahem, BCC Is going up again, I'm not so sure.
It's so hard, I feel like no one knows.  When I read the posts of BCC supporters now, I feel like there is more to it than just propaganda anymore.  These are uncertain times...especially since I always "followed" the core team, but with what is coming, that all might turn into a huge steaming pile of shit in a heartbeat.  
I should have stopped getting in to the politics and just hodl'd my btc and bcc.  I took the advice of this sub, and my own personal thoughts, I'm absolutely not blaming this sub, my actions are my own and I take ownership, but i wish I would have just held both forked coins now suddenly. 
Maybe someone is in the same boat.  Feels lonely and unsure.  I guess that lonely/unsure place is the place money is made... but it's also where you lose it too.
No risk, no reward.  More uncertainty? More profit.  
....wait a minute.
I got in to BTC on principle.  Tired of fiat.  Wanting something better, living live on values and beliefs.  Freeing myself from oppression.  What happened? When did I become this greedy bitch instead of a poor dude believing in bitcoin based on fundamentals.  Watch out friends.  Be happy with whatever happens, do the best you can, and if it doesn't work out, at least you know you did the best you could.  Don't become shitty and bitchy.  I guess I'm talking about me here.  Damn.

No one can make a run on bitcoin, the coins are all immutable and represent something.  You can't have more bitcoin out there than exists.  So there is no "run" because if everyone withdraws, it's all there.  It's not like some bank only has 10% actual bitcoin and has loans out there that represent 80% of money they don't have.   Sure the value can fluctuate, but you can't increase the amount of bitcoin supply or alter its value other than from what pure market forces do.  Sure there are market manipulators out there but there are important differences.  You can't inflate it, change its interest rate or do anything.  It's like blocks of gold, not magic Internet money that came out of nowhere

I bought two coins at $908 and they said the coins will deposit on Jan 11th.  I waited and it said pending for 5 days.  I saw a $1 out and $1 in to my account on day one or two.  On day 5 my bank account was 1800 less.  Still waiting for coinbase to say I have 2 coins.  It's more of a musing for me at the moment but I am ready for the idea of BTC and wish it were fully adopted.  Anyway, that's my newbie experience so far.  I just have coin base holding my wallet / "vault" because everyone that says keep them yourself doesn't do anything other than say "get a hardware wallet.  Write your keys on paper and put them in a safe deposit box... etc.". Now, I'm no millennial blaming everyone but those instructions suck other than giving an idea.  I am looking in to trezzor and the whole idea to educate myself on how this all works at the moment.  The best way, really, is to teach yourself and learn from experience.  I watched bitcoin when I was depressed and broke on 4chan and everyone posting on it and thinking $50 a coin? Damn that's expensive I wish I had money.  Now I'm making money and investing and have a bit of money for "fun" and bitcoin was my go to even at $900.  I really think it's he future but how long away that is...I don't know.  Will another cryptocurrency beat it? Will a quantum computer crack it? What if what if.  The only thing I know for sure is that it's bullshit when a bank can loan out more money than it has to people to buy houses.  It artificially increases home vaulted based on money that doesn't exist But is "available" and causes people to work 30years +to earn enough to pay it off.  I think bitcoin is the solution to getting away from the corporate tower.  I feel like it's more human, more barter.  The fact that I'm might be misinformed doesn't elude me, but everyone has their ideals and reasons, right or not, and moving to bitcoin is an idea I can get behind.  My girlfriends best friend got blown up in his hummer in Iraq.  And for what.  Put the army to use making solar panels and be free of that shithole!! No..  we have to follow our masters and pay for Halliburton and the defense contracts and the people in charge creating pain and suffering for profit.   A tried and true way no doubt.   But WHY.  We can do better, and if our governments don't allow it, maybe the way we spend our money can still be something.  Ah, there I went again...

I started in bitcoin because I believed in it.  Now it's turning into a windfall and confusing my motivations.  I feel like it will be a bubble when more people buy it thinking to get rich quick rather than believing in it to use it and it's principles.  So much money will be in it without the backing of the concept.  When it doesn't pan out, the tons of newbies and weak hands will bail.  Leaving the core believers back where they were before.  A lot less wealthy, but nothing they didn't have / or were at before.

And by that I mean, find out who the people with money are, know everything about them, and then "meet one of them by chance in a bar, and "oh my god we get along so well!"

This is what I did and what I think is "right for me."
I have $22,400 in a Roth IRA in a index fund (vanguard) and is what I am saving for retirement.
I have $18,500 in a 401k that also is in an index fund.
I have $40,000 in cash (because I don't really know what to do with it and this includes my emergency fund and 6 months living expenses so really it's just $20,000 of money I would actually do something with but no more.
I have 
$2k in Apple 
$6k in Tesla
$2k in an oil company
I have been eyeing bitcoin since I was in college and on 4chan back in 2010/2011.  I wanted to invest but I literally had no money.  I now have a job and some savings and I realize that in your spot, putting all your eggs in one super risky basket is your hope to get rich quick.  That might get you a windfall once but if you think it's a long term strategy, where you keep finding high risk high reward investments you are bound to get burned more times than you are successful.
I purchased $1000 in bitcoin a month ago to get a jump start and am planning on dollar cost averaging for the rest of the year like $100 bucks a month or something.  
I think that exposure is even risky for me but if i lose it all I'm still "safe" and can say "ah well, it stood to make me a ton of money but I didn't get raped by it when it tanked."  
If you are that desperate, that you want to make so much money and want to put all your money in to it, there is a guy that did this.  He sold everything he had and put it all on roulette.
Link: 
  Yeah, he won, but I think this is comparable to the situation you are putting yourself in.  You might be a millionaire or you might be broke.  Usually there are more broke people in this world than millionaires.
Figure out your own answer but my set up is what I gleaned from the finance subreddit and I feel "safe" yet still able to keep my money moving and working for me a bit.
I too have secretly high expectations for bitcoin but I also know that it can tank, become illegal, etc etc

This is the literal top again after flirting around $3k it dropped to 1750 and floated around 2200-2500.  Now it's finally running up to 3k again and no one knows what will happen, but right now you are experiencing on of the  investors fallacies, the "fear of missing out." its when you panic and put more money in to something and/or jump in for fear of missing out on a great opportunity.  
Just stop.  
Breath.  In and out, in and out.
Think about what makes you like bitcoin, the utility? The "decentralized nature?" The ability to be part of something new and ground breaking? Good.  If those things matter to you and you honesty see yourself using bitcoin in the future, then put some money in.  If not, if all you can think about is "oh my god bitcoin is going to rocket should I invest way more than I'm prepared to lose just on the off chance it might skyrocket?" Etc.  Just chill the fk out and sit down and 
breath.   In and out, in and out. 
Relax bro.  You want my advice?  Buy $500 of bitcoin and keep it long term.  If $500 is too much and your not ready, then do what others do, buy $100 every month or whatever you are comfortable with.
I'll end with this, no one yet, that bought bitcoin and held, has lost money.   Maybeeee those fools that bought at 2999 when so many algos and investors knew there was a psychological block that they could play against, yeah, maybe they are still a bit red, but if they held and didn't sell when they lost 45% of their money when it went down to 1750 from 2999 maybe they are feeling ok again instead of suicidal for putting more money than they were prepared to lose in to a currency they didn't understand and whose only motivation was to make a quick buck.
You gotta be cool, you gotta make decisions that are right for you, and you gotta put at least *some* money in to bitcoin.  As long as you are ready for a wild ride and don't mind keeping that money off your books for a year or more.  See what happens, buy bitcoin now at the top, but don't go all in right now.  Buy $100 worth, or jump start with $500 but be ready for some wild shit.

I'm just gonna say, that as part of a diverse investment plan, putting at least some money in crypto currency is prudent.  Going "all in" or over extending isn't part of any good investment plan.  True, I wish that I put more money in bitcoin last year, but still, I'm happy that it made sense and if I lost it, I wouldn't be cleaned out.  
There is a large consensus that many people/"weak hands"are just putting their money "safely" in index funds and such but when some shit goes down, these noobie investors will all sell driving the prices further down.
Here, since you gave some advice let me give you some.  Buy $1000 in bitcoin right now.  And leave it there for 5 years.  Buy $1000 in your bond of choice.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:52:45
I bought one, then realized I wanted a backup if I lose it so I can just recover right away without waiting on shipping/backorder issues.  I know I can sweep to different places, but I prefer the Trezor.
Also, you can "*gift*" a Trezor to one of your *"friends*" ya know what I mean?
You can buy one bitcoin for everyone in your family, put each on its own Trezor and place all of them in a safe deposit box that you open and give to them in 10 years.  Making them all instant millionaires.
I dunno.  There's lots of reasons.

This is like, the worst possible comparison that could ever be made in the history of 
man.  I don't even know where to begin with how wrong this is.... not even wrong, just totally dissociated.  Doesn't even make sense.  The two are different systems.
And here's the real winger, if it *is* true, as you say, what happens *after* that low you show.  Does it go up again? Does it go up from 200 to 22,000?  Does it increase, if you were a hodler, beyond any value you ever expected???  Not one person.   Not ONE! lost money in the long run even if they put it in at the height of the crash.  If they held, they made their money back and then some.  Better to just ride the wave.  Screw price.  Stop watching price.  The real thing to know is this: 
If bitcoin survives on its fundamentals for the next 20 years, we will all be friggen rich.  And I'm not in Bitcoins to get rich.  I'm in bitcoin because I believe in it.  Usually that ends in me dead and sacrificing for a lost cause... but still, riding the wave so far has been fun.
Viva bitcoin.  Fuck the other shit.  If miners make money greAt. If the people can wrestle power, or at least can keep the conversation going, then that's a victory in my mind, between genuine honest people trying to make the world a better place, instead of the illegal fraudsters fighting the cuck general population fighting for the "legal" fraudsters, that were good enough people that they didn't realize they were being used.

Here is your advice man.  And this is important.
You are here because you heard something about bitcoin.  You heard it's making a ton of money and having a meteoric rise.  Great.  You are here to make money.  Whatever.  
Bitcoin was created for a reason and relies on people understanding and going with principles.  I bought bitcoin and am a happy hodler but at the same time really like what it represents, I feel like I understand it, and I appreciate it.  I personally want to support it and I try to spend it where I can, last thing was a computer, but I replenished with fiat.
Warren buffet said never invest in something you don't understand.  I agree with that.  If you are in bitcoin or thinking about getting in bitcoin to make money money money then sure, you will.  You will have a more comfortable time riding the roller coaster, and I'm talking 30% drops just as much as rises, if you truest believe in bitcoin and are in it for the long term.  If you see yourself in 5 years using bitcoin on a daily basis, that that is a possibility, then you're on your way.
Either way, buy a bit of bitcoin today with money you're not afraid of losing, because you very possibly can, and start reading about bitcoin.  There is something more robust to bitcoin than just making money and I feel it is worth getting to know or understanding.  In the mean time, get at least some skin in the game and join the rest of us, lately we're having a great time and there are highs still yet to come.
I can see it now, you buy 1 bitcoin at $4300, it drops to 3,300 again.  It happened to me.  I bought some at 3,000 and watched it drop to 1,800 in a week.  After a couple months it flirted with 3,000 again and now we are here.  If you can handle that, then ur good.  Join us!

I had my first bitcoin on coinbase.  If you trust them, then you're good.  You prevent yourself from making a mistake.  At the same time, there was a prior exchange, mtgox, and now "btce" getting shut down for laundering money, etc. that can make your own personal control of your money disappear over night without you having a say.  Many people lost a LOT of money when their exchanges failed/were shut down/subjected to government controls etc.
The only sure way to secure your funds is to hold the keys yourself.  This can be done with a paper wallet, a hardware wallet, or an online wallet/through your phone.  I personally recommend the hardware wallet option.  A paper wallet will require a bit more experience and steps to ensure is properly safe, and I have no experience with an online/phone wallet.  My hardware wallet Trezor allows me to use by bitcoin daily and allows me to feel the keys are secure, the Trezor never reveals the sensitive information like your computer with malware can.  With your private keys on your trezor, you control your money and are essentially your own bank.
Go online right now and buy a Trezor, set it up, and send your funds from coin base to it.  They are safe there.  If you want though, as a newb, keep them on coinbase, they are insured against certain things and the likely hood they make a mistake might be less than the possibility that you make a mistake yourself.  Like copy pasting an address with a clipboard malware installed automatically changing your copied address to the criminals address when you hit paste.  I personally type in the addresses manually and triple check them.  If you use copy paste, just make sure the same address you copied was pasted.  I could go on, but the information is out there.   Reading is your friend.

Huge difference in that if the bank loans out 10x on your deposit to make money and fail, the government will guaranteed bail you out for that amount.  In bitcoin ? "Hahahahahahahahhaahhaha go fuck yourself" is all you'll get.

It's more of a musing for me at the moment but I am ready for the idea of BTC and wish it were widely adopted.  I watched bitcoin when I was depressed and broke on 4chan in 2011 and everyone posting on it and thinking $50 a coin? Damn that's expensive I wish I had money.  Now I'm making money and investing and have a bit of money for "fun" and bitcoin was my go to even at $900.  I really think it's the future but how long away that is...I don't know.  Will another cryptocurrency beat it? Will a quantum computer crack it? What if what if.  The only thing I know for sure is that it's bullshit when a bank can loan out more money than it actually has to people to buy houses.  It artificially increases home values based on money that doesn't exist but is "available" and causes people to work 30years +to earn enough to pay it off.  I think bitcoin is the solution to getting away from the corporate tower.  I feel like it's more human, more barter.  The fact that I'm might be misinformed doesn't elude me, but everyone has their ideals and reasons, right or not, moving to bitcoin is an idea I can get behind.  
My girlfriends best friend got blown up in his hummer in Iraq.  And for what.  Put the army to use making solar panels and be free of that shithole!! No..  we have to follow our masters and pay for Halliburton and the defense contracts and the people in charge creating pain and suffering for profit.   A tried and true way no doubt.   But WHY.  We can do better, and if our governments don't allow it, maybe the way we spend our money can still be something.  Ah, there I went again...

I believe in bitcoin and I want it to work.  I buy and hold and use it regularly.  When I "use" it, I usually replenish with fiat because I don't want to end up like the 10K btc for one pizza, but still, it's just more support/money in to the btc system.

There are more than 20 crypto currencies right now.  Just like beanie babies, whichever is popular at the time gets the money.  Everyone who owns it sells it like a gold mine because others buying in to it have a self interest in making the price rise as they build interest in it.  True, if bitcoin is the one that succeeds, it stands to make you a lot of money. But it's all fake and based on what people will pay for it.  Just like beanie babies which had the market capped and now are just another worthless toy.  Be careful.  Invest what you don't care to lose, or just put that $1000 on black and see what happens if your looking for instant gratification.
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:00:23
I like having my money under my control and not in a bank.  The bank, even your bank in ����. loans out more money than it actually holds in deposits.  That's every bank in the word.  It's how they make money.  When the economy tanks, or people make a "run on the bank" everyone is trying to get their money from a bank that doesn't have it.  When inflation hits, you lose all your money.  When someone in Venezuela saw their countries currency go to shit based on poor policies and over reliance on cartel style oil funds, the shit hit the fan.  Outside of having fiat in the bank, bitcoin allows you to have value that transcends one federal bank or currency and give you value on a broader market, the word market where you are protected in case your currency devalues or crashes.  Usually because of shitty policies and the banks tinkering with interest rates etc.  they are always trying to squeeze out as much as they can from us but not tank the economy doing it, they don't always succeed.
I like to have my money under my control.  You use exchanges as an example, yeah, I buy my bitcoin on the open market but I don't store them on the exchange.  Bankers are manipulators to the markets.  Exchanges *are* the markets.  Don't compare an exchange to a bank, I know some out there delv in loans and such,  it really they just facilitate trading like Wall Street. 
You are so die hard on the bank, fine, continue to use it.  I don't care.  That's the great thing about bitcoin.  It lets you do whatever you want and not have any animosity.  It's like, instead of hating a system you feel is corrupt, even if it isn't, you have the ability to be free of it if you want to with no qualms or otherwise ill will.

I went in on bittrex and I'm very happy.  I left Coinbase active so I have multiple outlets if I need, since there you can only cash out $10,000 at a time.  My second account is in bittrex and I recommend it.  Actually, I recommend having an active profile with 2 or 3 places in case one fucks over.  Having said that, I keep no coins on exchange, all on a hardware wallet and only send when I'm ready to sell / buy.  That kinda screwed me when BCC came out, I couldn't dump at 700 and got out at $400.  But whatever.  Security over profits.  Can't make money when you lose it all to some stupid error.

Other people are pawns to this manipulation and have no recourse.  I’m talking about the single mother working the diner for an hourly wage that doesn’t keep up with this inflation.  Every dollar she gets she has to spend and her pay doesn’t increase to match, it always lags two to five years behind, and even then, the raise doesn’t fill the gap that is always forming in front of her.  Nothing terrible in a few years, but a significant difference in the quality of their life over her whole life.
A monetary policy.  It rewards the strong and “in.”  It only fucks the normal American.  
Queue the: “get a better job” “get educated” crowd....
No.  It’s not about that.  Doing that just puts you above some other poor mother fkr who is now on the receiving end of this “monetary policy.”   Dog eat dog?  Too bad so sad?  Buyer beware?  Long live Capitalism? Those arguments don’t change the fact that someone is still getting hosed, it’s just a different person now.  It’s not defensible in my own opinion.  
Maybe there is an argument about how this 2% stokes the economy and helps more people than hurts... but damn for that single mom waitress trying to make it.
@_date: 2019-08-04 21:53:52
The only correct answer.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:57:46
Some say that bitcoin isn't inflationary like fiat, and that's mostly true.  When bitcoin was mining in the early days, miners were rewarded with 50 bitcoin per block.  Now, through "halfenings" the reward is 12 coins soon it will be 6 bitcoins and get smaller and smaller.  So, for the short term, yeah the amount of bitcoin is increasing, but will stop at a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. 
See this site 
It shows some good info.  Essentially bitcoin is not inflationary, but will still have more coins created over the next 120 or so years.  
There are 16,500,000 out of the 21 million already in circulation.  So that "inflation" is almost negligible, just waiting on another 5 million to be made in that long time frame.
And another important point, is that this "inflation" is not in the tradition sense that someone can control it, increase/decrease it, have inflation % "targets," and whatnot.  It's built in to the system and mostly protected from meddling and therefore can be accounted for in a relatively concrete way/expectation. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:16:57
Hmmm.  I have bitcoin and I support it.  Granted when I buy things, it's either in Germany or America and with bitcoin, I pay zero exchange rate fees to the local currency so it might be slightly skewed/favored in my personal situation for just that fact alone....  That fact in and of itself makes it worth the "5 minute wait."  The other thing, I usually just order online and submit the bitcoin and wait.  The package takes 2 - 5 days to get here anyway, I'm not noticing lost time.  The fee is negligible for those larger transactions.  Or at least, in the way I use bitcoin, it is.  As time goes by, and it becomes more accessible, as in I buy a "cup of coffee" at a point of sale, then yeah, it doesn't make sense right now.  But it's getting there.  And all along the way there so far, I have been able to use it in a meaningful way and a way that's "right" for me, and the overall idea of the transaction I'm taking part in.  ...for everything else, there's VISA. (Still).

"Not a crypto-currency guru". And who are you may I ask?  Anyone that owns it promotes it like a pyramid scheme to make themselves money... anyone who "knows" it, says it like it is, a high risk high reward investment.  Don't bs me by saying it's a shoe in.  Tell me what makes you a guru and I may listen more to what you have to say.  I'm definitely an open book and I'll be honest, my experience with bitcoin so far is a wild roller coaster.  It reminded me of my mom who got in to beanie babies and had thousands of dollars of "value" but now has 5 rubber totes full of cotton fluff and material.  Not worth shit.  I personally own ~2.5 but coins from 2013 and just held on to them to see what would happen.

I totally agree with you.  These loans and debt have allowed this stuff to spiral out of control and I’m pointing out that these irresponsible practices have led us to this eventuality of negative rates.  We...no, not we... the BANKs overloaned money that didn’t exist and now they are complaining about the bed they laid and now have to lay in.
That’s what my first comment was.  Where did we get to a point where I support this system.  I’m bashing it from the start.  But we all have to live in it, it’s they game they made.  Hopefully things will change.  But knowing what needs to change... it’s gonna be a hard ride.  But I’ll never feel bad for the bankers.

Zero conf transactions are useful when you’re buying something at a store.  With the bigger block size you are guaranteed to get your transaction in the next block (close to 10 min or less).  With a very low, if not zero fee.  With Btc you have to pay (as I did at the height of the fervor in December) $40 for one transaction to guarantee it went through in the next block, which was important to me.  I didn’t really like that and it was because not all the transactions that were made “fit” in the block size.  Since then I have seen value in the bigger block size and truly wonder why it isn’t larger.
What are the actual drawbacks of raising the blocksize limit when demand is greater than what it can handle?  Why purposefully make others wait and transactions stagnate?  I’m sure there are answers, I’m just searching for them in a place that I feel should know or be able to answer.

Its almost as if people thought these coins could do something! But wait.... no... HUMANS got involved!  Now we have hundreds of “actors” saying “they are the one!”
I’m tired of this evangelical bullshit.
Show me the coin that works and is widely adopted and developers that don’t say shit.  The ones that let the coin work for itself in a useful and accessible way.
It’s tiring.  People are tired, and once they realized the coins were frought with infighting they all cancelled their interest.
If only satosthi made an immutable coin, instead of one open to forks.... a dictator in this respect... might have been a better choice.  We all need to be on the same page no matter what,  not continually debating and forking and ... and this is an inevitability... sabotaging others for the sake of their own but without merit.

Nah, I made my own decision.  Fuck Jihan Wu and his Chinese conglomerate and fuck ASICboost, etc etc.  the list goes on.  Since you know so much, I shouldn't have to get in to the details of what you sacrifice by going BCH and god forbid NewYorkAgreement2x
Time for me to sound like an old man.  I started for the idea.  God damn, be free!!transfer coins human to human!  No meddling, no bank, no interest or late fees, no inflationary control and motivation over the people forced by an illegal monetary control.  Soon I agreed for the technology, I sided with core and I still agree with their decision to change btc.  I believe they are still doing their best to keep bitcoin from turning a truly human freeing technology into a investment bankers boon.  I don't want another bank.  I want user activated soft forks to keep people honest.  I want discussion and caution.  I want what btc has.  Discussion and community.  Now the community is filled with fucking millionaire wannabes and bitches.  Bitcoin the last 6 years of bitcoin has been real.  Lately it's just a bunch of fickle assholes jumping from coin to coin finding "the next big crypro!!"
God damn.  Bitcoin is unique in this space.  The core team, to me, is dependable in keeping the integrity of bitcoin and it's original purpose.  I realize BCH is "more bitcoin" regarding the original vision, but the changes made came from somewhere.  I was there, I agreed, I'm here now.  
Fuck it.  Can I be one of the people who wants bitcoin for something other than making vast amounts of money?  Can I support someone or something on principal rather than the now now now now of humanity's fickle instant gratification addiction.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:07:45
First of all, just talking about it here is kinda dumb.  Second, if you genuinely lost that much money and intend to "prove it" you probably should file a police report.  The IRS knows where those bitcoin went (it's on the blockchain) and when anyone goes to spend from it, they will see it moving.  You might end up using bitcoin to buy something and send it to your house and then they know.  But what do I know.

Deflation is great to the early investor but almost insurmountable to the person we try to get to adopt.  Granted 1bitcoin is always 1bitcoin, but we don't live in a world yet where that parity doesn't have a real world consequence in an otherwise fiat dominated world.

Any other prescient advice I can use? Beside your it "IS HAPPENING"
Get fucked. I fully expect it to drop to 2k.  The price of value for it.  Right now it is a ponzu scheme.  Banking on the best bet for the future.  Sure we all *want* it to happen, but this bullshit 400% in a year has some reckoning that is due.  Once people realize we are all investing in something no one can actually use yet.  Don't get me wrong, we are early and we are getting rich, but it's suspicious to say the least.  Braggarts like you proclaiming $10,000, even if it's true, are diminishing the value. 
Maybe you proclaim, "bitcoin is now accepted by Amazon, or insurance companies now accept bitcoin" etc etc. THAT would be something.   You, just masturbating to the price, makes me "count my birds in hand at $2k and my birds "in the bush" at $10,000."
It's ducking flimsy, and I hope I eat my words, but we are entering the realm where real use and real acceptance as a currency is needed before I believe in it any more.  Despite the fact that people are making me rich.

If it goes to zero I will be very sad for them.  (So I bought them each some bitcoin secretly and am holding it forever in an amount I'm comfortable holding for at least 10 years).  To each their own.  I don't get my family in it, because frankly, I want to use it but they have no desire to.  And although a lot of people here just speculate and want to make $.

Everyone needs to realize that the whole world uses bitcoin and it varies amongst all of those currencies.  Canada already sees 12k and Great Britain sees 7k.  It's all just random emotional bs people are trying to play off of.  I thought I "called the top" at 7400 and I didn't sell and I was so mad when it dropped to around 5k.  But the thing is, it went back up again.  No way I would have expected it to go up at 5 passed 7 and now approaching 10k.  Today, I love the fact I just held and didn't try to nail the tops and bottoms... after all, no one can... and I'm better off for it today.

Increasing block size, at the time, would put too much power to bitcoin miner giants.  Giants that with their 8mb blocksize and working ASICboost to "cheat" would centralize too much power and have other ramifications.   This is what JihanWu and company wanted and forked off.  
Btc on the other hand, is attempting to keep the block size in line with the use and scale as the use requires.  They are trying to keep the competitive nature of bitcoin accessible, and ready to scale to larger blocks when they think the time is right.  In the mean time, they are literally trying to upgrade bitcoin into a newer more user friendly and better "package" for all use types.  This is way more complex and if successful will create a product that is more robust and useful than simply increasing blocksize at the big miners request
With segwitt and the lightning network as they intend to implement, they are trying to make bitcoin better.  Now, the companies that are set to control these networks... they are definitely dubious. 
I don't think anyone knows the answer yet other than to say that there are good and bad on both sides and we are in it.

You should get whatever amount the value of the bike is.  Fair exchange at market price.    Why should you get more value for the return of the same item.

I agree with you.  I just say right now the value does not equate the use.  It's mostly built on speculation.  Hopefully it all works out, but my entry point is much lower and although I've ridden the wave, there's no way I'm getting in for more "right now" because I'm waiting for the fundamentals or the widespread use to catch up to it's ridiculous price.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:02:34
You should get bitcoin back, but if bitcoins value rose 20% since you bought it, you should get 20% less bitcoin, still being the fair value for the item at the price you paid.  Because now their bike isn't on sale for 1.0 btc anymore, it's for sale at .8 btc.

It's a tough cookie to crack for sure.  Since bitcoin and the dollar is interlinked, it can't be ignored.  One day we will live in a day and age where that is not the case, but right now we need to understand there will be an ongoing conversation about topics like this and no one can be offended by the other.  
New precedents are being made, and ultimately it relies on the specific "terms and conditions" of whatever retailer you choose to use.  Each retailer may have different takes on this and you need to make sure you are aware of the return policies of each retailer.  
As the bitcoin acceptance world becomes more ubiquitous, this can be leveraged and maybe you get the same bitcoin back even as it increased in price "because other retailers are doing that", but would you be willing to get your refund at a lesser bitcoin value? Assuming it goes *down* in price? I think not.
e.g. You have a legitimate return.  You paid 1 btc worth 1 bike at the time.  Now 20 days later, the price drops.  You get your 1 bitcoin back, but if you go out to spend it again, you can only buy 1/2 a bike due to the down turn.  That's not fair to you, just as it's not fair to the retailer in the same position on the opposite side of things if the value goes up.

Anything and everything can be used for a crime.  It's all up to the user.  Guns kill people but we allow them.  It's the ultimate unregulated thing, at will, anyone who owns one can go nutzo.  Anyone that owns a gun can do a terrible thing while the majority use it properly and lawfully. 
AOL instant messenger can be used to steal money and accounts by frauding people.  A phone can be used along with western union money grams to cheat people.
This is nothing about bitcoin and just another story of the same fraud happening on a different medium.

Eh, 850 million unaccounted for since requests have been made with the respondents in November.  Those were simple requests and I t’s been 6 months and still no answer.  Now they are suing to require updates no longer than every week.  If there really isn’t access to the 850 million, hell, they asked for just 100million to help with withdrawals and couldn’t even get that.
It stinks man.  Why would they have to sue, were the respondents just withholding information?  Why would they do that knowing they are being investigated.   What, when it goes to court they will show the judge “hey, we had it all along, here it is.”  The first words out of the judges mouth will be, “so wtf has been the problem??!  Send these withdrawals and get you people their money back!”
I doubt it.  It’s messed up.  It’s probably not going to affect anyone not directly affected by it, but still, leads to less confidence in the market.

If you are considering 5 stocks and bitcoin, divide your money among 6 things, each getting a 6th.  Bitcoin in this instance can be considered "just another stock" to diversify with.  If that's what you're going for.... me personally, and a lot of other people will say put it all on bitcoin.  But we all know that the future is not certain despite my hopes.  
Some say, don't invest what you don't mind losing.  So far my experience with bitcoin has been very good but I know despite all this, it could come crashing down at any moment.  And at that point, having some safety/protection/diversification in your money is important and you will love yourself for not putting all your eggs in one basket.  If it goes to the moon, you will still have some profit but I would rather be mad I didn't make a bunch more money but still be happy I had made money, than be mad I lost it all on one "stupid" bet and am now destitute.

Basically *anything* is possible, but not probable.  In a specific system (imagine a box with stuff in it) the probability of everything being in a certain place is more probable than others, but nothing is impossible. 
That's my eli5 for what it's worth.
Other than that...
The cool thing I see, is that time is kind of a funny thing.  Quantum mechanics doesn't really know what time is.  Quantum mechanics allow every single possible organization of particles at any given time...everything can happen at any "time" as we understand time.    
Kind of like the parallel universe idea, where everything you want to happen does happen.... somewhere.  A lot of other worlds happen too and those are more likely, but in a given system anything and everything can be possible at any given moment because time is like this manufactured thing humans relate to that doesn't really mean anything in the other dimensions of reality.  So even though we can't predict for sure, we can play the odds.  Maybe you've heard "god doesn't play dice"  widely misused quote, Einstein merely meant that you should be able to calculate everything definitively, but because quantum mechanics is so curious, it really seems you can't.   But we don't know yet.  It's all very mind bending and fun to think about even if we are "wrong" about it all, if that's even a thing... being wrong.  Because if we are and we think this, it is, and if it is, then how did it come to be other than through the particle experience that preceded it.  Somehow bringing us to this conclusion.  I'm going off the deep end

There is no cause for these pumps and dumps and I’m just holding. If there was actually people using bitcoin I would be interested.  But there isn’t.  It’s all just baseless speculation.  The next bitcoin bump will be this again.  And again and again until people are actually using it and fiat falters.  Don’t FOMO. Get some and chill. And if you realize, “hey, I bought this bitcoins stuff but I’ve never used it.”  Then you realize an important fact.  
I recommend you get some to have.  But if you have some already, chill out until you start using it.

If you trade on a place like bittrex, if you sell any of the alt coins for "cash" they aren't actually giving you cash.  Thy are giving you "tether."  It's not really a coin per-se but it is a token that isn't the same as USD.  You can't withdraw tether except for its current exchange rate.  It facilitates quicker transactions and is essentially a place holder for cash, but it's not cash, and I would feel more comfortable keeping my investment in bitcoin that sitting on the market and having it in tether. Waiting to "hop back in" if I were a day trader type.   
@_date: 2019-01-07 03:00:02
Because it would literally take a computer the size of our solar system and every atom filled (assuming a transistor can be as small as a single atom) to “crack” a private key out of only knowing a public key.  
Maybe quantum computing will beat bitcoin, or other crypto’s.... but if it does that, then our current banking system is Fk’d too.  
Bitcoin protocol is miles ahead of what we have now and if your actually worried about the next thirty years of computing, you should equally be worried for the next 10 in our current system.

@_date: 2018-02-09 20:17:53
The reply is more lanes on the same highway *is* more lanes.  That bigger blocks does not constitute centralization and that argument has been debunked.  The response is that bitcoin was fine, and moving along properly to the bigger block size, in line with use, and that bitcoincore artificially kept the block size low on giving dubious reasons and now *Is* centralized in block stream.... just some company trying to wrest control/power not actually bitcoin.
What’s your response?
Bitcoin *is* immutable.  Lightning network and segwitt are not.  There are a ton of coins out there that already do what block stream is trying to do.  Original bitcoin has no segwit, and no lightning network, which works fine if there isnt a block size *limitation* artificially stunted from growing as expected.

Here is the kicker.  I can transfer as much as I want to bittrex, but they only allow me to withdraw 2.5 worth of btc per day?  Until I'm a further verified member/whatever, my withdraws are limited despite the ease I had in depositing.  I'm sure it's a minor thing and maybe not even what these other dudes are complaining about, but that's my experience with btc specifically.  With Coinbase, I have had no issues withdrawing fiat.  (Bittrex doesn't alllow fiat in or out directly so that comment was a bit off topic, but also related imo)

I don't make my choices based on what other people ban or don't ban.  My government banned marijuana but I'm an independent free thinking person and I smoke it.  I know child porn is banned, and rightfully so, anyone can make that distinction.  I'm thinking that making an easy comparison, bitcoin is a honorable endeavor and no matter what any government says, it will still have utility and be a boon for humans overall.
That's one thing I enjoy about bitcoin.  It lets me control my own money, and make my own choices.  Despite what some asshole in Washington says to keep power in any way he can.  I understand it can affect the economy too, and I don't want to hurt the economy...but the greed and bullshit and tinkering with interest rates, and subprime loans, and all that, is becoming criminal in and of itself.  Bitcoin frees us of that shit.  Ban it, go ahead.  I'll still use it.

Am I the only one that buys bitcoin *specifically because countries like China* ban it?  Like,  to me, that's the whole point.  I believe it now, and I'll believe it down to zero.  
If bitcoin "fails" then the sheep we are.... the sheep we have become, will be the revolution of a younger generation "taking the power back."  
Hopefully things like bitcoin are human, and  staged (a non escalating response if you will).  Not radical and insurgent like the future might require if we take inaction...  If we make these small, sane protests today.... we will save the lives of the subjugated masses reaching out for equality.   ....like... even saying bitcoin is a "response" is even giving the banking system and world powers too much control.  Saying "fuck the banks buy bitcoin!!!" Is anti establishment, and in that, just cements their influence.
I buy bitcoin to be free.  Hey? You do your system, I'll do mine... no ego, no animosity, nothing.  I'm just going to live my life (as bitcoin enables me to) and be happy.  If being clever and banking works for you? Great! Keep doing it.  I'll do what I want.  Perfecto.  Freedom.  Love and let love.  Live and let live.
If bitcoin goes to zero, so be it.  It won't, because I know I, and another special someone out there will be willing to barter our immutable internet money for goods and services outside some overlords "approval."

Something called "tether."  Tether is not backed by anything.  The people who control tether say that it tracks and is *roughly* equivalent to the value of the USD ($).  The problem is, that the people who offer tethers are making it out of thin air and is not backed by anything.  It's allowing margin buys on bitcoin and allowing more money to buy bitcoin than is actually out there.
Just like the banking system.  They only need 10% cash on hand to loan out 100% cash (90% that they don't have, but don't expect it to be withdrawn and can make the bank money during the time that the fake money is out there).  This is what ultimately allowed the housing market to climb and houses to become astronomically expensive, and when it was realized, the whole system came crashing down (2009 financial crisis). 
The same thing is going on here.  People are starting to fuck with cryptos in this way.  Because of shit tether is doing, bitcoins $ price is not the same $ price you pay when you spend your $10 "in hand" money.  It's starting to become inflated in a fucked up way and although I love bitcoin and all they cryptos around it, I am fully ready for the perceived insanely high value that has just seemingly come out of nowhere, to be very weak.  
I'm a holder, and I believe in bitcoin, but this *may* be one of the reasons, amongst many others, e.g. North Korea creating uncertainty (in my mind it makes me want to get more bitcoin, but others it's the opposite), that China just banned ICO's, which could be a unreasonable scare that in the long run, in my opinion, will be better for the crypto economy (no Paris Hilton scam coin to drop cryptos credibility), and a plethora of other reasons.  Maybe the 1700% litcoin pump this year had to back up a bit.  
There's lots of reasons.  I wouldn't buy any substantial amount right now, but I'm not selling either. 
And at the end of all that, it could all be totally unrelated and who the fuck knows why any market does anything.  It's like swarm intelligence or swarm patterns.  Who knows where the flock of birds will dive bomb next, fly left or right, go to the moon.  It's unpredictable and goes off chaos theory just like Dr. Ian Malcolm explains in Jurassic park bruh. 
Get some bitcoin, but get it like 6 months or more ago.  Stay wide eyed, and present.  Learn, read as much as you can (about *everything* world news, politics, dates with women,  music).  Do it all, but whatever you do do it with passion and rigor and you will be fine.  Keep asking questions, try to start answering them for yourself, and then see what others have to say.  Don't be lazy and not form your own opinions.  Just asking and waiting for an answer is the worst service you can do yourself.  You will just get what others will feed you.  And it's usually not the good stuff.

I'm in at $900 and I have stop losses set.  People seeing the meteoric rise and betting everything on black makes me think bitcoin is "worth" ~$1800 (or zero) and the rest are just money grubbing fools following a fools errand to get rich.  I "see" bitcoin is worth $4k, and i HODL, but I'm out at $1800 and still made more money this year than my 7% vanguard fund....by double (doubling my money not double the 7%)

Everyone in here just keeps saying how they bought and bought and bought.  People better start using and accepting this shit before everyone realizes it's only propped up on their own fervor.  Don't get me wrong, bitcoin is great, but it inherently only has as much value as we all give it.  If it doesn't start gaining an actual use instead of just everyone's fear of missing out then we are in for a rude awakening.  It's gonna be very interesting.  I wish I had more ways to spend it personally.

You want the bitcoin, trust me.  But you might not have the knowledge to do it right.  If you feel comfortable learning something new and don't mind risking the money you are about to be paid by making a simple mistake, go the bitcoin route.  As a new user, even if you are perfect, I wouldn't do it for more than I would be willing to lose.  Whether that be by a mistake you make or if bitcoin drops to zero.
Ultimately it's "easy" but there is so much more to it.

It's about adoption.  Right now, bitcoin is the immutable original store of value.  They are working on making it more accessible.  The subsequent coins are trying.  You know coke and Pepsi right?

The only thing I want.  The problem I see.  Is that there is a way for people/companies/etc to cheat or gain competitive advantage.
I want a bitcoin that doesn't matter whether you are a corporation or a single dude.  I want the "difficulty" to be the same amongst all people.  Let me mine, let the corporation mine, let the Chinese server farm running off of government dam water bribed power, all mine off of the same equal capacity.  
Somehow code this.  
This will be an immutable ledger.  This will put true power in the hands of the people.  Slightly off topic, but this would be the ultimate solution,  let every single person on earth have the ability to mine, if they do choose, and make things more ubiquitous.  
Somehow.  
Do this. 
We need a smart motherfucker to figure out how.  
The original vision is to give the equal power to the people, or at least "free" the people of government control.  
Now that bitcoin has garnered traction.  All sorts of "influential" (read: assholes) parties are using their power to control bitcoin.  It's fucking flimsy and makes me sad.  Just like the banks.
I'm an innocent bystander, hoping for a better life for all, financially and otherwise.  Bitcoin needs to be robust.  I have a small investment...slightly *more* than I'm prepared to lose (as the old adage goes) but really hope that the core devs (the only people I'm in line with [not trust]) figure out a way forward for "the people."  I think THAT is in line with satoshi's original vision.  I think THAT was in the original vision, and *now* we are dealing with a monster.
I love bitcoin.  I love the concept.  I saw it in 2010 and as a broke college student couldn't afford the $50 I wanted to put in to it.  Now I realize, like others that it was incredible.  Initially, I just saw the good idea.  Now I'm in a place where I'm sad.  Sad for the money grubbing assholes.  Sad for this sub.  Sad for a lot of things.
Facebook used to be cool.  Posting pictures, having a good time, keeping people up to date with distant relations.  ...now?  Now it's an advertisement pile of shit, influenced by corporation level assholeness.  For ever 1 wholesome family post, I have to sift through 20 reposts of 9gag.  Fuck Facebook, fuck the people who artificially engage for profit.  Bitcoin is turning in to this fucked up beast.  I'm still invested... but these are my hesitations, as an "innocent bystander."

This and the fact that tether is artificially increasing the price with money that doesn't exist.  "Tether tracks the USD". Bullllllshit.

You paying $10 cash is free money to the $10 tether that's actually worth $5 or some shit.  Could be better or worse, they won't release their accounting.  It's like a possible 2009 bankster sheisters greedy fuck up, and no one is coming to save bitcoin.  The taxpayers under the control of the government were conned in to it.

Everyone says to not keep your coins on an exchange.  I understand why and I agree with that in most cases and I'm aware of mtgox and right now the worries in bitfinex.  Having said that... I feel like the advice to not store coin on an exchange (in this point i specifically mean coinbase and have no idea about experience or offers from any other) is dangerous to a newbie.  I'm so worried that I'll lose my coins myself more so than coinbase.  I'm worried I won't write the one single thing down properly and in one simple error, because I don't use it very often, will fk up my seed or address and lose it all.  Coinbase states that they insure your money, I know even if "insured" anything is possible, but I also feel like I'm more protected and put more faith in coinbase than myself.  If they lose my coins i feel like I have some recourse, if I lose mine, I'm shit outta luck. 
Maybe someone can tell me why I'm wrong, but in doing so, also help a few other people out there why this thinking is bad.

I know nothing about "IT" and the guy at my work who does "IT" is a friggin moron.  I was in college and severely depressed and lurked on 4chan.  The random (/b) sub always had people talking about bitcoin.  I wanted to buy some at $60 but I was a broke college student.  I knew enough about it from just that and kept it in my mind.  When I was done with college and finally had spare money to leave and hold with, I bought in.  That was after watching it go up to 1300 then crash.  I thought "thank god". That's when I started really reading/hearing more about it, and got in at 800 for what it's worth with the money I had to put in to it.  I'm super happy now, but think back and know I wanted to buy a few at $60 and didn't.  Whatever.  I could have lost money I couldn't afford to lose back then.  Now, I couldn't care less and still consider it a "bet" but as time goes by, it starts making more and more sense.  Until it doesn't and crashes and you suddenly might be happy again.  Probably not... but how do you know.

All I did was sign up for coinbase.  They made me send some info and I think a picture of my drivers license? I can't verify that but I also linked to my checking account to get my max weekly to $2,500 per week allowable instead of my credit card $250-400.  I think coinbase is super easy although I hate the fee.  I'm happy though.  You just gotta have a little more resilience, you sound a bit fickle if buying bitcoin is "too hard." I know we live in a give me everything at the touch of a button world, but there is stuff worth working for that isn't handed to you, and quite honestly, buying bitcoin is about as easy as certain things get if you spend some time on it, have patience, and work on figuring it out rather than making a post bashing it.  I don't mean any offense by any of that.  Just get to it bro.  Read up, do your homework, follow a link on the sticky for newcomers to bitcoin.

I want to run a full node but wonder what computer I should buy to run it.  I want a dedicated computer if anyone knows a parts list to build what I would need.

@_date: 2017-05-30 21:35:01
Etherium runs on a centralized basis.  No other altcoin has the broad spectrum nodes and higher "decentralization" or blockchain extent.  I'm in bitcoin and at the same time won't touch any other alt coins.  I believe in bitcoins premise infinitely more than any other altcoin, even if/when I am proved wrong and go broke.  Right now, bitcoin to me is the only sane choice.  All these other "alts" have their place, but I have no use for them or direct interest.  I will live and let live, and even if I'm wrong, I still support blockchain and bitcoin until something "truly" better comes out.  
I was "this close" to putting money in etherium but I didn't because I realized I was motivated by greed and not true basis.  I'm not a super idealist, but when it comes to my money, even if it's for the worst, I don't care.  I love my life and try to make sure it's on principle rather than greed.  Fuck money, live a life of meaning.  Money helps, no doubt, and I'm not stupid, but I try to never lose sight.  
We are humans on this earth, everything I just talked about is manufactured.  Live and let live and do what's right... but to do that ignorantly is to be put at the mercy of money grubbing whores.  Be smart, put money in bitcoin, and take control of your future in a way that isn't competitive (stooping to their level and engaging in equally poor practices) and join the ranks of people who "hard fork" in to a world of their own creation, outside the influence of the oligarchs... or whatever the fuck you want to call "them."
Be a human of the earth, be free of the control and influence, but still work towards a better life for all.  My favorite quote from the movie 300 is when Leonidas and his "300" are about to leave Greece for war and the politicians say "you must not go to war!! What can we do?!?"
Leonidas simply responds "what can you do."
When I took on that mentality in my life, rather than "im only getting paid $9/hr to sweep floors so I'm only going to do the minimum possible for that pay" and started sweeping ALL the floors, cleaning up more, putting my entire effort in to everything I did, only then did people notice, promote me, and put me in a place in my life now where I can look back and spread this knowledge.  Maybe everyone knows this already, but when I started applying myself and doing "what CAN you do" instead of thinking just about the $9/hr, I blossomed into a true human and strive every day to help people, do what's "right" (which often times includes infinitely more effort than it's "worth") but is worth it.  Be a man.  Be a woman.  Whatever you are, just DO IT.  Put yourself in to it and be free of the sedation out internet connect lives make us complacent by.

That's the way I feel about the stock market, that's not the way I feel about bitcoin.  Bitcoin transcends borders, policies, austerity measures, inflation, etc.  bitcoin is not only at a tertiary level a hedge for me, but I also primarily, I believe in what it represents and stands for.  Bitcoin empowers people rather than banks.  I can only get behind this.... banks and economists have calculated how much they can squeeze out of people and were there for a while.  Now things are being pushed and people are being squeezed by greed rather than honest banking and interest rates.  Even right now they were like, oh shit, let's drop our rates to zero we basically strangled the economy, better let off for a little bit before squeezing again.  Fk right off, I'm tired of being played, we are being played.  Switch to bitcoin because it's right.

This is just a general question to everyone in this thread which I think has relevancy to the topic.  Would you keep all 10,000 GBP coins on one hardware wallet with one recovery seed? Or would you divide the total among two or three hardware wallets.  I guess you open yourself to the chance of losing or not being able to recover some, but at least all your eggs aren't in one basket if something terrible happens?

I'm happy that there is a post on here that brings me back to the reason I "invested" in bitcoin in the first place.  
At first I saw it in 2010/11 and was mildly bemused.  Over time I learned more about it and wanted to take part.  I'm happy to have "gotten in" early, but I didn't put more clout in to bitcoin until Jan 2017.  I realize my motivations are partially financial right now, but I realized also that the posts on this sub of late have been really off from the *real* reason I put my money and faith in bitcoin.
I remember buying based on principle. I remember going in on bitcoin for real reasons, to free the people from the brutes! I no longer want to be a machine man.  I want to live free and secure. I want to control my own destiny.  Maybe I'm an optimist, but the real reason I'm in bitcoin is based on that. 
I'm losing sight lately and dollar signs are clouding my vision.  The posts here all talking about "price" and "August 1st" .... I don't know, it's all so base.  These topics are clouding my mind from the real motivations and as to why I am in bitcoin.  I want to bring that message to the noobs.  I am a noob too, but want to appeal to people just looking to make a quick buck, there is something *more* to bitcoin than these debates and roller coaster rides.  We are all participating in a world changing event that in my mind can only bring good things to the people who adopt it.   To the guy who'd hodls, Viva bitcoin!

...having said that, if the AI can do that, we all will have a shit ton more to worry about than bitcoins.  Which is kinda why I don't worry, because we will all be equally fk'd not just the bitcoin people.

I think they have an adapter for it at the Apple Store, it's $40 so it's really high quality and worth it.
But seriously, I was thinking about it later and the whole premise behind bitcoin is that we as humans start helping ourselves rather than being fed what other people tell us.  True, there are expects in other fields and I'm not saying we all need to learn to do every profession but googling and reading and finding intrinsic motivation to learn and set up a node on our own, having no experience, is a challenge/task/ whatever that would probably not be a bad thing to figure out on my own.  Take control and learn through reading and engaging the community to make it more robust and while your at it find that personal satisfaction that comes from trying/doing something new, and something that matters to boot.

Either a new renaissance, or a new world order.  Something.  Some sort of ascension, or the enslavement of all humans, slightly, to make one person uber powerful.  Like the lottery, but on a global scale.

The price of bitcoin doesn't matter because you are essentially just swapping dollars for bitcoin no matter the price.  You get equal value for bitcoin as you would have for your fiat/dollars.  Now, if you convert your dollars to bitcoin and bitcoins value goes up, well, good for you.  The point he is making is that you should change away from fiat regardless and in to bitcoin based on principal not because, and very likely so, your money will increase in value. 
I hold bitcoin because I believe in it.  I don't buy it because it is speculative, even though it has a nice added benefit.
No matter when you buy bitcoin, it will still have the same spending power as the fiat you bought it for.

Jeez.  
Fine, but a common topic is, when the time comes, you won't have to convert bitcoin to fiat.  Meaning that bitcoin will act as its own currency to "barter?"  I don't know.  If USD is not being exchanged, just bitcoin for goods, does any of this apply? 
Also brings up questions in my mind about why you said.  Webcam interviews with every customer?  Coinbase had 100,000 new registered users.  That's an insane amount of man power and time to figure that all out.  I understand the need for due diligence, but man.  
I guess the future is uncertain, this is fine, this is normal, and only time will tell what bitcoins future is.  It's the Wild West right now as far as I can tell.  Because of that I use google sheets to record every date and transaction amount.  Whatever comes, I'll be ready at least.  Many won't.  Makes me curious what unsuspecting citizen downloading some mp3s...ahem I mean trade bitcoin, and get a $500,000 fine and 10 years in jail.

Dang, why? Just because of the speculative nature to make gains? Or is it because you truly believe in it, the process and such?  Despite the issues bitcoin has, I personally never had a transaction take more than 20 minutes (have only made 9) and usually pay what I would consider a high fee ($2-3) on anywhere from a $15 to a $890 transaction.  I know the amount specifically doesn't matter but rather the inputs.  Anyway, I'm
super happy and I feel like BTC has such a wider base, foothold in society thus far, and such greater feeing that I control my own money outside of of a central core.
Tell me, is your motivation more speculative or is it really based on the idea that you want ETH to grow and for you and everyone to use it on a regular basis just like I swipe my cc for a cup of coffee.
I have to think you are going in to ETH just to make %gains on your money.  Maybe you can let me know what your thoughts are on my possibly tacit assumptions.

He considers a lot of things in here which is fine and all, but I can't help but think he is comparing bitcoin to a normal stock.
Bitcoins value is not in its sideways tradability as a new currency compared like gold, securities, or cash.  
Don't confuse the utility of bitcoin just because it tries to be used in a familiar format at point of sale transactions and trades.  
Bitcoin is a new paradigm in the way we spend and control our money and as it adopts a greater user base we will all laugh in the face of this chart analysis.
In the short term, maybe it's true.  In the long term, with what my hopes for bitcoin are, let this guy play his charts and do his thing, in not worried about it.

It's great to hear all of your replies, thank you.

Every time I do it usually ends up being better.  Thanks for all the input.

I agree with this!  I look around and just feel like an observer in a world of cattle mindlessly going about their business.  I know people have more depth than that, but  still...  and then I wonder about the people that think the same thing about me.  There's always ignorance and always something to learn.  Don't be a Jerk about it, just keep at it and keep sharing ideas with people.  No one has the ultimate authority, but sharing ideas allows people to make their own decisions instead of being fed one without thinking.  *that* is what will truly bring us to the next level.  
Good that you found bitcoin... but don't become complacent in just that.  Keep learning keep sharing ideas, keep being constructive.  It's a great life.  Do it.

Just to give some perspective, I was born in Germany and my dads family lives there still and can't stand the "Amis".  (Ahm-ees).  My moms side of the family left Luxembourg after ww2 and came to America and love this country.  I truly get both sides 100% and I appreciate the conversation.  I know some of what I said has more to it but I enjoy reading what other people think.  I do think there is a lot more fucked up than is right, but regarding the middle class... the world is globalizing.  China slave labor is competing with everyone and we can't keep that same lifestyle anymore.  It's a closed system this word anymore, and equilibrium is happening.  I don't know how all the stuff an American had vs the slave conditions Chinese have is sustainable, we will come down, they will come up.  I feel like it's basic force/void or whatever.

Your Fiat Punto is a gem.  New cars are stupid!  I had a beat ass minivan from my family and I *hated* that thing.  And yet, now that I sold it and have a dumbass Subaru crosstrek (it's actually cool tho and gets good gas mileage and has zero reliability problems) I look back on my minivan and realize how great a car it was.  All my friends would pile in the beater and we would go to a concert or hike or wherever.  We got in it when we smoked weed and did shrooms.  It was a great car and i miss it now looking back.  The new car is just so sterile and the car payments aren't the most exciting.  If you have an old car and it works, keep it.  Lifestyle creep will make your bitcoin disappear.  Just like the guy who bought a pizza for 10,000 bitcoin on "pizza day" you too will cry when you bought a Toyota Camry when you could have secured your retirement with the same amount of coin.
I vote, if the car is good and works, keep it.  If you have a pressing need for a new one, buy a new one.  If it's just looking for an excuse or a reason to spend bitcoin just because it has high value, don't do it.

f you keep them on coinbase I think there is a way in the "vault" to have your private keys assigned and stored "cold storage." Which is *slightly* better than just keeping them on the exchange, but I have no idea about that really and if I don't know about it I don't do it/recommend it.

My family gave me shit.  But now that I'm on the rocket ship I have given them mercy.  I have secretly bought a bitcoin each for them on their own trezzor.  I do this with the profit I have made on bitcoin already. 
Despite the profits though... seriously guys.  The real reason bitcoin is so good is because of its decentralized nature and its power it gives back to "the people."  Don't lose sight of your origins people, it's so important to believe in bitcoin for the sagelike longterm idea of releasing ourselves from the puppet masters.  I in secret have a bitcoin for my dad, my mom, and my sister.  One day they will ask me again about "bitcoin" and I will tell them about it.  They will be sad they didn't invest, and then I will surprise them with a $50k coin each which I paid $900 for and ask for my $900 back.
Or bitcoin will fail (almost infinitely unlikely in *my* mind but it might), and I'll never talk about it again and keep the trezzors for posterity.

@_date: 2017-07-30 15:24:26
I guess I'm not an authority, but this is an article I read and there are more out there that talk about this type of thing.
SegWit opens the opportunity to introduce sidechains. These are less secure than on block scaling, but their hope is that they will be good enough.
Ignoring all the economic consequences, what we have in segregated witness is the illusion of scaling.
What they have in fact introduced as a 2 MB block and segregated witness at the same time. Increasing the block size is a scaling solution. Segregated witness is not. Segregated witness with a standard weight provides between 1.2 and 1.6 times the transactional throughput based on a 1 MB partial block and a 4 MB full block.
The reality of this is we have 4 MB masquerading as one. In a secret 2x option this is doubled.
Contrary to what you are been told, the witness information, that is the digital signatures are important. These have probative value. This comes down to this idea that code is law once again and that they can just simply bypass everything in a typical anarchist BS format. It does not matter what users do, it matters what exchanges and businesses do. These entities can be forced to comply and they will be. In some places, such as Victoria in Australia it is actually a criminal offence to delete data that is associated with financial transactions. For general users, pruning this information is not an issue. It is an issue for merchants and other companies. Under the legislative provisions they will be required to maintain the full data.
Consequently, it is an issue of a scaling solution that is not providing scale. It is the blocks I increase and not segregated witness that provides any increase. What we have is a typical magician's trick. It is a bait and switch. You look at the introduced information as they have you look away. What we really have is a 150% increase at a 400% cost. The simplicity of this is just increasing the block size provides 260% more throughput without SegWit.
Putting it another way, segregated witness has 62.5% overhead. That is it reduces throughput by two thirds.
In many ways, this is the biggest confidence trick to have ever occurred within bitcoin. It makes Mt Gox seem mild.
I say this again so that people understand it.
Segregated witness increases the amount of data storage and network traffic by 400% to gain a transactional throughput of 150%. Simply introducing a 4 MB block or in SegWit 2x and 8 MB block will gain 400% and 800% of the throughput respectively.

He drew some trendlines on march 3rd that relate to previous lows and highs.  When you draw a bunch of lines from those points of "support" you can *sometimes* use those lines to predict what will happen to a price moving forward.  The two lines of note around  are the ones he "predicted" would happen and they did.  Bitcoin price went down a bit and then peaked at 2800.  If the drop didn't happen, the other higher line with bitcoin peaking at 3200 would have happened, but it didn't.  He predicted the latest bubble. 
My question for him now is, "what's next?"

If you haven't already, open a Roth IRA with Vanguard and put $5500 in it (the max you can for the year).  Take the other $4500 and put it in bitcoin when it drops to 1500 in the coming weeks.

Bro.  You know "now" but remember America "then?"  Let's go back to 1914... We wanted nothing to do with World War One.  We tried to stay out, keep our isolationist mantra, but we were pulled in, saved everyone's asses and won the war.  Then we chill and go back to the way things were, small army, happy in our own.  Then World War Two breaks out and again we try to stay out of it.  Everyone begs us to help, we don't, we get attacked so now we have to. We ramp up our war industry *again* from weak/nothing and join the war effort and save everyone's asses again.  Afterward, what do we say... we say fuck this!  We are keeping a strong army and going to intervene before shit becomes a world war.  
We are proactive and now everyone is pissed off at us and tells us to mind our own damn business.  Whatever...
We helped half of Korea stay free, the south is booming now.  We tried to do the same in Vietnam but it didn't really work too well.  Instability and famine in Somalia?  Anyone do anything to even *try* to save those people?  The liberation of Kuwait in the 90s? The stop of the massacre in Bosnia?  Don't forget Russia was in that hotbed of Afghanistan and had to deal with extremists well before we went there...it's been a powder keg all along.
True, a bunch of shit went down and it didn't always end up great, but America did so much genuinely good shit for the world and we weren't always like that.  It's hypocritical to say we control everything now, when all we wanted to do was be good people and mind our own business, and only at the pleas and request of the world were we pushed in to action.  
True, Lately it might be turning in to corporate/special interest war industry thing, but it didn't start like that, but it is what is keeping a lot of hot spots from blowing up.  The Middle East and Saddam and ISIS was not "created" by us.  They were there and they are still there.  Since the 60s their mantra has been looking for an opportunity and now we have a shit storm, but it's not like we set out to do this shit.  
Americas military states that it is a force for good, and I believe that.  Call me a sheep, whatever.
Having said all that, I do think there are controlling powers that are getting out of hand and getting too good at calculating the minimum a population needs to live off of in this brave new world we are creating and living in.
We can always improve, and I believe in bitcoin because I believe it can improve and even enrich our lives.

That my friend is the ongoing conversation.  The faster the transaction, the less secure.  The longer....mmmm not longer, the more *robust* the checks and balances of the transaction, the more secure.
It's always a conversation about security vs speed.  There is a balance, but right now, seemingly, we can't have both fully.
I personally favor bitcoin before all this.  I use it as a store of value and to make larger purchases that can wait and be fully confirmed.  I wish personally that nothing changed with bitcoin.  I didn't mind paying $3 to send $250+ transactions because of the utility it offered and the way I used it.  To me, and my usage, this whole fork/split was just more uncertainty and made me, like others worried.  But fortune favors the bold and new horizons need to be found.
The other side, is the daily user.  Yeah, fees were too high for smaller transactions.  Charged $2-4 to buy a $20 item? Ridiculous.  Wait an hour or more for full confirmation sometimes? Unusable at the "point of sale" type purchase we would normally pay cash or credit card for.
I am still optimistic though, if the segwit implementation means that daily transactions for smaller amounts will make more sense, then that utility being built in to bitcoin will expand its usage and i very likely will participate in it to a greater degree.  Maybe I'm misinformed, but I believe segwit takes a hit to the security of the transaction.
To the future, whatever it may hold :)

If you "chose" a chain, I'm sure there others out there that will choose the other? Then is it possible for someone to "double their bitcoin" by selling all from the chain that they don't want to be a part of and buy on the one they do (before one of the chains dies and it's not clear yet which will survive)?  I realize that opens you up to an all or nothing scenario, but is that a correct thought or what can happen if someone want to?
What does it mean when they say my BTC will be on both chains.  I guess I assume something incorrectly here which is hindering my understanding.

I was in college at the time and was on 4chan reading about bitcoin all the time.  I wanted to buy like $5 worth just for the lulz in 2010 but my fucking checking account had $124 in it at the time.  Thought it was too opulent at the time.  As soon as I graduated and got a real fucking job I didn't buy because I saw what happened after mtgox and thought it was done/just a nice idea/gimmick and didn't go in then.  Started grabbing some at 800+.  I don't kick myself about it because I could say the same about Apple stock and other shit but whatever.

No kidding.  Banks need what, 10% of the actually money to be able to "loan out" up to 90%?  Many margin accounts require more backing than that... but that's what happened in 2008.  Too many loans went dead, no one had any of this "fake money" and we all got royally fucked by the stupid recklessness of the banks.  Move to bitcoin, a way to isolate yourself from one countries shitty policies, manipulation, and fraudulent practices.  True, in 2008, bitcoin value may have fallen along with the rest of the world, but take Venezuela for example.  Their governments hyper inflation has destroyed many people's life savings.  The people who bought bitcoin with bolivars before it went bunk are saved.  Well, maybe not entirely because their government banned its use, but at least they have this store of wealth they may be able to re-access after all this shit settles down.  
Bitcoin is not a scam, bitcoin has many uses and is a tool.  Not a be all say all, but a tool to be used along with your other investment and day to day payment needs.  I personally never think putting all your eggs in one basket is a good idea, and for that to hold true, even if it's only a little investment in bitcoin, *not* engaging in bitcoin *now* is limiting your diversification at the very least.

Because if you use the word "investment" in that you are an "investor," then every investor knows the value of a diversified portfolio.  
Bitcoin has enough stance in the world already, and such high hopes moving forward, to at least consider putting 5% of your earmarked investment money in to it.

We will look back at people carrying a wallet or an iPod (like we do now) and laugh that we needed to do that.  Credit cards will look like VHS tapes soon.  The way to the future is in electronic money whether that be from the banks and cc companies or from bitcoin.  Cc companies have a "pretty good" exchange rate overseas but bitcoin theoretically has none (depends on %higher cost of living vs lower etc).  But in general you would expect to get similar goods anywhere in the world for the same amount of bitcoin.  That right there is so amazing.  No exchange rate, no fee just to use your own money.  I mean for god sakes you just want to trade the money you earned for goods.  Fair.  But everyone seemingly needs to stick their hands in your money any time you want to do anything with it.  Now, I am absolutely 100% for being compliant and reporting my taxes accurately, but there seem to be situations where what people have become used to and have come to expect, is just not good enough and I think a lot of people are realizing that now.  
Bitcoin will always have that as one of the things that will always keep my interest in it succeeding and try to support it where I can.  
A lot of talk lately and a lot of it makes it seem like it's all or nothing for bitcoins future.   Right now I think bitcoin is being accepted and gaining strength.  If it catches on, it might be a major boon.  If not, everyone also says equally it may go to zero.  Some lawmakers may step in and some other countries might suppress this technology.  When it becomes too disruptive, maybe only then will they drop the ban hammer on it.  That is a very real possibility.  Another third option though, is that it doesn't go to the moon like we all hope, but stay at a nominal exchange rate, like gold for example and remain a very capable store of value for certain groups to continue to trade in, even if at a limited capacity.
I hope you are wrong, yet I see where you are coming from and I see all sorts of ways bitcoin may not prevail.  Only the future will tell, at least at the end of it I will have known which side I was on, and the does matter to me.  To the future! Viva bitcoin.

Yeah, the crypto is real actual "money."  When a bank sells a loan, they are only required to actually have 10% or so of the total amount of money they lend out.  That's why when there is a "run on the bank" it's because they only have 10% of the money.  They sit back, collect fees, sell riskier and riskier mortgages with crazy interest rates and take their fee.  When some shit goes down, everyone loses it all.  They would need a whole different way of lending money if it were based on provable money rather than this vapor they sell to us every day.

You just said all sorts of stuff at the user level happens.  Coinbase is trustworthy and insured, but if you personally get hacked or have your identity stolen or any of many things that can happen at your own personal level, your BTC may be exposed.  Coinbase is still a log on and their insurance doesn't protect against you getting hacked, malware, keyloggers, etc. I recommend a hardware wallet.  I You put your coins not just off and exchange, but offline via a hardware wallet.  That way no one can access your coins even if they know your login credentials which coinbase will absolutely not cover if that is the way your coins are lost.

A small symbolic amount?  I would say, create a paper wallet, go on local bitcoins, and ask someone for some small symbolic amount.  You can also make a sign, put your bitcoin address on it, and stand outside a sporting event and say
"Anyone spare a bitcoins?" 
Or something.  I bet that you get at least one hit from someone sending you something.  Or post on Reddit begging with your address there too.  Who knows.
All you gotta do is creat the wallet/address first which can be done for free and takes 10 min to learn and create if you are a total noob.

Interesting. But doesn't Trezor create many/new addresses?  I sent a "test amount" to it, and my real deposit was sent to the "new" address.

Can you do this?  When my bitcoin is stored in my wallet, is it possible that bitcoin hard forks and one fork dies? It's my understanding that if this happens, I lose half my money if I don't take action and sell the fork I don't want and buy in to the one I do want.  I'm really confused about that.  Maybe you can shed some light.  Is it truly ok to just hodl in a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:55:13
Yes.  I love the idea of having my own bank under my control offline and with no intermediary.
Here is a thought experiment, if the government suddenly makes bitcoin illegal, all companies and all insurance on those coins are now invalid and not legally binding.  Like in Venezuela right now.  Still, people use bitcoin in Venezuela away from the banks and survive.  Do you trust your government to "do the right thing?"  I don't.  My relationship with my government is like my relationship with bitcoin.  Trustless and  verifiable.  The only way I want to be moving forward.

Yeah...for which *they* are liable.  So when your porn site malware dupes the address you copy and pasted in to your browser or your email gets compromised because you were scammed, you're SOL.  Hope you at minimum have 2fa but still.... that guy with the Verizon phone and 2fa still lost $8k to someone who called Verizon customer service and posed as the guy.  
Screw a password protected exchange.  Get your stuff on a "you need to plug in this Trezor" to get my coin and you are much more protected.  I'm personally more worried about me personally losing my info than Coinbase.  And if it happens like that, you absolutely are not insured.
I have my "hotwallet" there, but only what I need it for to sell BTC for fiat in an easy way.

When you "have coins on both chains" does that mean the value is cut in half 50% chainA / 50% chain B until consensus is made? If I sell all of chain A before consensus is made and I buy that amount in chain B did I then just double or nothing my money depending on which chain wins?

Yeah, if you look at the google authentication app, there are 1/3 1 star reviews for people frustrated by not being able to easily transfer their 2FA to another upgraded or different phone.   Whatever.  I read that, now that I know about it, that extra 15 minutes of time to undo 2FA ten redo it on a new phone is nothing compared to the security I feel.  Just be aware.  I feel like bitcoin is engaging in a way that makes you be self reliant of your education and security.  It's not some CC company that writes off shit from people who only know how to whine anymore to get what they want.  Bitcoin is real, and harsh, and you have only yourself to blame for not learning.  There is no customer service agent to suck your cock because your offended/dissatisfied.  REENGAGE PEOPLE.  Take control of your lives.  For fucks sake.

There are people out there who genuinely need bitcoin.  Sounds like you threw a few hundred bucks (or whatever your low fun money to throw at something is) and have no care other than to maybe get a little profit.
People genuinely need bitcoin.  Some realize it, some don't.  I believe bitcoin will remain and be a boon not only for your paltry bet but for oppressed people around the world.  But maybe I'm wrong too.  Either way, if you bought some, good for you, hold it at *least* through August 1st and even if it tanks after that, keep holding.  No one who ever bought bitcoin and held on ever lost money.

You're right, there was a lot of wrong information that I believed at the time and in my moment of panic, I thought these things, hopefully it answers some questions for you.
At the time, I believed that when I typed in "51" and hearing "your google account is now active" I authorized an Authenticator.  I found out later, this obviously was not the case.  I had just been working with my Trezor a few days before and security and bitcoin was "on my mind."  I instantly thought that I had somehow just given him the last piece of the puzzle to get in to my account.  I now realize that the Authenticator is tied to the device, not the phone number.  At the time, all I could think about was "holyyyy shittyt move your coins to somewhere safe you foooool!" 
Secondly, I was a bit panicked, and I know it's never good to panic.  Although I was highly worried, I ran right to my computer and started typing.  Initially the password I typed had a typo.  This made me think it was already too late.  I tried again and then remembered I used a @ instead of a ! In the password.  I got in then and I suddenly started feeling better. 
Third, when I got in the account and changed the password and 2Fa and seemed like I was still logged in, i went to send my BTC.  When I went to do this, it logged me out of my session saying my credentials were no longer valid.  That's when I thought he was "out there" actively trying to get in himself and changing the info himself.  It really just wanted me to use my new password to log in, and the Authenticator then didn't work or I made a typo.  After a few attempts, both password and Authenticator worked.
So, it seems, I was a bit nervous and just trying to get things done in an expedited manner.  It's not easy to stay cool when you think because of your stupidity you lost such an important thing. 
All of your confusion about my post is warranted,  it's kind of representative of how I felt at the time.  I thought none of this was possible, but at the same time, remembered the guy with the verizon phone that posted and lost $8K.  That's all I could think about suddenly and didn't care if it was possible or not...I suddenly my felt like I needed to move off exchange anyway and immediately.
Hope that clears stuff up.   I have read so much about bitcoin, been on this sub and learning and getting all the info I can, but this was a curveball for me and just didn't have the confidence to "know" that that situation was more me freaking out than an actual compromise of my account. 
It's like on a test in school.  You've studied and learned and then there is a question you think you don't know and get worried, then you use all the info you know and try to figure it out.  In my instance, it was changing all my passwords resetting with a new google auth and moving to my Trezor.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:43:20
I'm not being a dick, I'm just trying to put it plainly.  Run away from coinbase and don't look back.  They charge a notable extra fee for bitcoin for their "customer service" or whatever they say they offer for it and they have the longest support ticket times and their site shuts down when bitcoin falls.  You literally have no control of your coins on coinbase and the 7 days after you purchase before the coin gets in to your account is just unreasonable.  They just take your money and buy when it suits them.  You are letting a company decide how/when to fill an order and with distinct losses recorded by many people due to their antics.  If you are a lazy noob you will use coinbase.  If you are a intrepid individual who takes time to learn and takes time to control their money instead of sucking on the banks teat again, then you deserve it.  Bitcoin was a great idea, now all these people are manipulating it into something that resembles a credit card rather than true power to the people, personal knowledge, and informed decision making.  Our political climate is now mimicking in bitcoin and it makes me sad.  New people to bitcoin who don't care about the real reason behind it are diluting it and bringing their own preconceptions to it.  The market and money that is driving this is undeniable, but it still makes me sad that not everyone is in it for the base reason it was created in the first place.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:41:59
Well, the price/value of the dollar fluctuates daily also, it's not nearly as volatile, but bitcoin is inherently anti inflationary whereas fiat is.  That at the base level is true despite the price fluctuating trying to find its place in the market.  That doesn't have anything to do with its fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:19:49
This is so funny, I go around asking all sorts of people if they accept it.  Some people get embarrassed, others have no idea what word is coming out of my mouth, others are just a flat "no," and only one guy so far wanted to know more and I told him all about it.  I think he is looking in to bitcoin now :). Hah.  The more you know.  My girlfriend still thinks I'm a pedo/drug addict doing shit on the "dark web". (Not really but she gives me shit). Then I told her we can go on vacation because of bitcoin and she shut up after that ;)

When you press the keepkey button it sends you to the Trezor which is being sold for$185 on your site.  -20% is $37 = $148. Which is $48.05 higher than the price on Trezors official page of $99.95.  Unless you are offering free shipping or something, you're charging 50% more not "20% off."

@_date: 2017-06-05 12:20:43
Well, I don't mean to apply a stereotype, but the only reason I mentioned that, was because I always see people using/selling calling cards at the carnicerias around my house because people need different options for calling home, whatever country that may be in.  Obviously not just Mexico.  Since the guys name was Alex Cruz, and he was explains how he didn't have a cellphone and was using Google voice, I let the idea of "this sounds like a total scam call" fall into the realm of possibility.  Maybe this dude just needs to use some internet phone service instead for whatever reason, and I let the idea be plausible that it wasn't a scam which is why I went through with it. (Like an idiot).  I love my neighbors and we grill together.  I hope I didn't come off as prejudiced when I said that.  I just know it's not so easy to call areas in South America and you can't just "use your cellphones" because, yeah we have connection here, but out there where their families are might only have a land line.  Hence the need for other methods like calling cards or maybe internet calling if they have that but no cell tower.

Other "coins" are based on some persons "server."  They can openly edit at will the coin base system they use.  Like electrum.  Electrum had a major security vulnerability and they "lost" money.  The developers were able to hard fork and restore people's funds.  So, what's to stop some controlling body?  The banks right now that we are trying to be free of already manipulate our money.  Bitcoin is a fully independent blockchain based currency and wildly adopted.  If some asshole at electrum decides to make off with you money, he absolutely can.  If some asshole at bitcoin wants to, he can't touch your privately held coins.  Bitcoin is miles ahead of any other coin in that regard, and the "feature full" coins being peddled are just some assholes get rich quick scheme.  True, they serve a purpose, but I'm in bitcoin for the fully independent control I have over my coins.

I had never heard of that ever before.  I know it sounds crazy.  I really should have known regardless, I admit that, but it happened.  Crazy.  I still am in disbelief of how stupid that was.  But a damn good reminder of how shit can get fucked so fast you can't even stop it if you realize it.   Just like that.  Damn.  It taught me a good lesson today.  I got lucky, I don't deny that.  It seemed the system had my back anyway, but I posted this here just to show how being so careless can affect you and how worth it it is to stay knowledgeable.  I guarantee you there have been and will always be coin stolen/lost/etc for less than careless actions.  Im just leaving my story here for others to see.  But yes, if you are in the habit of literally consenting to your phone to be cloned don't keep your money on the exchange.  Right.  God damn.  It still sounds stupid.

That's right, that exactly what I did.
At the time, I didn't realize it.
When "Alex" called me after texting me to start, he said, to speak to me, when i call from a different number press 51 to enter our conversation.  I got a call, it said please enter your code, and like an idiot I typed 51.  Then it said "thank you, your google account is now active" or something.  Obviously I was oblivious to cell phone spoofing and I had. I idea what I had just done.  I immediately went worst case scenario and thought somehow I just compromised my google auth.   I know now, that wasn't the case and without him having my physical device, I was safe all along.  My nervous fingers caused the mistype password, and when I changed the password, although it looked like I was still logged in, when I went to send my BTC, it logged me out and said "login credentials not valid."  It just wanted me to re-logon with my new password, which I thought (in my mind at the time) that it was actually him trying to change my password to lock me out somehow.
All along it was just all me.

Well I can only imagine he can't produce too many per day and marketing them and all that with his at home laser printer he made 20 signs with or whatever.  So many companies have a large set up, factories in China that would jump on making them once they become profitable and destroy his at home margins.  The irony here is his scaling problem with bitcoin[signs] haha.
