Blockchain/Crypto is the future, there is no better way right now... the snowball is already too big!!! It's only a matter of time. And totally agree with you, hodl, but try and play it safe in stable coins when bear markets hit... but if you're like me, i just hold and wait for the BULL RUN!!!

I think you have 3 main types of Cryptoers- idealist, opportunist and then a hybrid of both:
\- Idealist- HODLer- buys in on ICOs, dips and holds
\-Opportunist- Buys the trend- ICOs or an bullish market, sells safe in ether or btc, then even sells coins for fiat (p2p or exchange)
\-Hybrid- Is avidly taking part in the blockchain crypto game and is never selling fiat, buying dips and investing into great ICOs... may hold a portion of coins in a security token to gain more on the troughs.

IF YOU'RE IN NOW, You're a 'HODL gang' member!
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:41:11
If you held at 19k, 
then held at 15k, 
then held at 11k, 
then held back at 14-15k,
And you're still holding... you're a 100&amp; HODL Gang member!  It would have been nice to sell at 19k though and buy back now... SUIWEEEEEEET!

I thinks that's a lambo below about to be crushed!

The reality here is, most don't have a choice. Many people are banking on crypto to be adopted in an idealistic form and fast- and it's not going to happen! CONFORMITY strikes again and regulation is the killer AND hope! Most people got in DEC JAN, imagine that! and now there is a hold from "regulators"  in the biggest market adopting blockchain/ crypto- the US. Have a look at this article, it shows the saturation of usage vs coins [ ... and now you see why there is a hold on BTC skyrocketing for now!

I shared a similar graph with a comparative of the dotcom boom and market value of crypto today. This chart is great because in theory, everything to the left (for what makes sense) should use blokchain and or crypto for payments. Nice infographic!
