Bitcoin does use a lot of energy but if you boiled a kettle for long enough you’d use the same amount of energy.
Had this conversation with some green dick on here before and pointed out this is all propaganda.
All energy no matter where it is produced will be consumed by us as we as a world are power hungry.
Any dick that tells you green energy can replace oil is deluded in the extreme as it cannot ever produce as much power.
Who cares how much power crypto uses just build more power stations if need be.
All these arse holes that talk about global warming want to look at beef farming and farming in general as it produces way more environmentally harmful gases than everything else combined but there is to much money in farming to ban that.
Fuck power consumption.

What does a ban actually mean in real terms as I keep hearing these word,the word THEY always crops up also.
I thought cocaine and heroine and weed were all banned substances right,but when the laws were created to make them illegal the price of those drugs didn’t go to nothing.
People keep saying about the price of medium of exchange or an agreement that one thing is worth that amount,well if they ban BTC or any other crypto surely as long as you still have belief in that price then there ban means nothing?
It is for that reason that you the people who hold these coins need to keep your faith in the price,if you do then no ban can ever work.
There will always be ways to change crypto into fiat and governments will probably find that coders and programmers will look for ways using technology to bypass there bans.

Yes your right and they do perceive it like this but there is a flaw and it is this.
There are only 21 million BTC but each one divisible by 100,000,000 and the chain can split multiple times to create more coins.
So BTC can be manipulated,it has already happened on many occasions.
The difference is that BTC isn’t a channel for lending and this is why it doesn’t create debt.

I thought the video was informative and well produced,and I agree that it did lack in that department as to why Blockchain and crypto token is needed.
But I hazard a guess that the mining reward is what secures the Blockchain,as the miners are custodians and keep the block chain sure for want of this reward.
Hence the token and the chain are intrinsically linked to provide structure and security.
Think this is why banks are wrong in the respect that they think they are creating Blockchain without tokens,when they are in fact just creating a not so secure ledger that in theory won’t be so secure because there isn’t consensus through reward to up keep it.
Also they under estimate the power they need to make this Blockchain secure through computationally mining the blocks.
That’s my best guess and I may be completely wrong as I’m no computer scientist but I’ve had very bright people post answers to my questions before and maybe someone can explain why.
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:16:57
Think you ought to read this,and you need to stop listening to main stream economics models.
For this reason your not seeing the full picture,nor do you have any understanding of crypto ecosystems moving forward.
No body buys in to a deflationary system as there is only losses to make in the long term as the value goes down.
Profit comes from the correct amount of inflation, a Goldilocks effect,not to hot and not to cold.
Your argument for BTC being completely deflationary is utter rubbish and you sound like a central banker.

Allegedly you say haha, the US dollar has already lost 98% of its value since it came off the gold standard.
I think people only change back to fiat because of volatility in the market.
But if BTC was accepted on mass globally then you wouldn’t need to cash out as you can in this instants pay direct, and it’s coming in time.
And it doesn’t matter who,when or for how much people cash out for because others buy in.
There are only 21 million do the maths.

The second link explains also why BTC is neither deflationary or inflationary
As we see it is a far more complex subject than BLACK and WHITE. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:47:04
Deflation is a macroeconomic term used to describe how a country sees a lowering of prices,like a ballon deflating.
Inflation is characterised by prices going up.
I said BTC price rise is inflation.
You are believing that BTC is deflationary because they hoard and don’t spend am I correct?
What are you talking about? 
Your talking rubbish.
Prices go up for many reasons,but BTC mains reasons to increase are firstly.
Supply and demand because there is a limit supply.
This is why they call it a deflationary currency.
But like I explained it hasn’t got a deflationary price increase,as the price going up is inflationary.
Second is the fact of adoption.
Third the fact of usages and application.
There doesn’t need to be any competition between it and other currency.
Simple way to tell you is hyper inflation or when a countries money goes into a spiral of soaring costs and you get bank notes worth millions,this is the next step up from inflation.
Then there is stagflation when prices are not moving or stagnant,this is lower than deflation.
If BTC was in fact completely deflationary no one would by it as it would lower daily until there was no value at all.
BTC has gone up thousands of percent,
Which of these other currencies it’s linked to are you talking  about have gone up thousands of percent exactly???
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:51:33

Your  little scenario of apples to bitcoins is in theory correct,apart form you presume one apple to be worth one bitcoin and you don’t put a value on the bitcoin or the Apple.
And yes if only 21 million people own 21 million bitcoins then I agree that no more can be created and this would be deflationary because of the fixed supply.
Now rewind and see what I wrote earlier,you’ll find I said it’s not actually completely true.
I said the value increase is inflationary and because BTC is divisible by 100,000,000 Satoshi,and in theory each Satoshi can be worth as much as we agree they are through consensus and other factors you now see it’s less deflationary.
Those whole BTC will be broken down as value increases,they must or people who want in won’t be able to get in.
This would mean the project would fail IMO.
If BTC is split and spread and the value has increased in this manner then it doesn’t look so deflationary anymore.
Also as we have seen any crypto token can be split making others and copies this is not deflation,it is inflation.
When you can show this other guy and me another little model factoring in price increase to adoption and show me where the deflation causes BTC to grind to a halt then you’ll have my full attention if you cannot then your argument is flawed.
Also can you answer the question you failed to reply to earlier while you are at it,the one where you claim fiat currency drives BTC price gains as I always thought BTC was nothing to do with fiat directly.
I wait you response.
Have in mind that anything that goes up is inflation.
The BTC supply may be deflationary by being fixed,but that doesn’t mean the toke price is deflationary.
Why would anyone buy in to something that won’t appreciate (inflation).
If you see the price go down today through volatility this is price deflation as the price goes down.
Oh and you never answered the white goods scenario I put to you either,
Seems you avoid answering questions when your wrong.
I think I understand the BTC ecosystem rather more clearly than you but time will tell who’s right or wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:20:49
I don’t understand their case,doesn’t their case presume that say BTC will be lent out to a value more than 21 million.?
If it is controlled within that 21 million coin state without borrowing or lending why will it get into financial difficulties.?
Is not their main issue that they lend far more money out than they have in reserve.?
And also that their lending criteria isn’t full proof against bad players and market moves.?
Surely if you take away a central banks ability to create extra money,for sure those bad businesses fail.
But by this admission are they not bad businesses anyway.
If BTC stays within its limited supply,and doesn’t become a means to lend with, then how will it get into the same trouble as paper money.
This is a presumption by the banks that the 2 are the same,but they are not as they work of different models.
Banking works by debt enslavement  of the population,giving that population a false sense of wealth through lending.
Also this is true of the banks as their wealth also in many ways is false as they do not have the funds that they lend out.
They purposely devalue the currency to keep that populous enslaved (this is why you always need more and that more goes less far in the shops).
It is a corrupt complex,Ponzi scheme.

Demand-pull inflation,inflation is caused by the over all increase in demand for goods and services,which bids up their prices,this theory can be summarised as 
“Too much money chasing to few goods”
In other words if demand is growing faster than supply,prices will increase.
This usually occurs in rapidly growing economies.
This theory is often used by the Keynesian school of economics.
And the guy sure knows more than you that wrote the article.
Now listen to deflation mr economist,in basic terms if mr nakamoto decided to sell or put his bitcoins out onto the market,by doing so he increases supply and this sudden increase in supply means,the price crashes through deflation.
Oh and in simpleton terms deflation is the negative effect of inflation.
Read the article again that the guy wrote till you get it ����‍♂️
Oh and the goods in this economic model are the bitcoins and they either increase in price or decrease in price,through many market factors but supply and demand in this case probably comes top. 
Read recessions and deflation this will clearly explain what happened to the bitcoin price after xmas,when it dropped like a stone.

You use the word deflationary but it’s not completely correct.
There is value inflation in BTC and other crypto that has real term applications.
BTC is pre programmed by being limited to always have price inflation by adoption.
It could in theory be worth all the world money supply value in that 21 million coin supply,so that isn’t really deflationary.
Deflationary is fiat as by creating more you devalue what existed before,so BTC is far more likely to increase over time and fiat destined to devalue over the same period.
Like you say about wages and your pay rise,but ask yourself how do you know what the real value of your pay rise really is in fiat?
As other market forces likely cancel that pay rise out.
The fiat currency world is a big illusion if you look hard enough you realise that the feeling of wealth and prosperity is created by inflation and devaluation,the latter being the biggest player.
So I myself would chance taking my wages in BTC and fore sure if I could spend it at more places.
This is just IMO.

Your argument is flawed and Ill thought out.
In your economic fiat model your prices will be zero anyway in the future as your currency will be worthless, there won’t be growth,more like hyper inflation.
You see what you fail to see is,inflation will be ultimately the killer of all economies through bad money management,they all become an Argentina or the like we have seen sink for the reason of inflation.
