interested in this too..

I agree we would have to see how society adapts, but deflation is not a completely unknown thing. Currencies can and have deflated, and led to lower aggregate demand, thereby lower employment. And if i'm not mistaken, when the governmetn wants to increase employment they generally start with increasing inflation, could be wrong on that though.

While this is true to an extent, it does seem well established that deflation encourages spending, which stimulates the economy, generates job growth, makes loans more accessible and payable for the average joe, and so forth. 
The federal reserve does seem to be a little trigger happy when it comes to printing cash, which is generating certain economic issues in the long term, but it's important to remember that pretty much every national economy (i think?) relies on inflationary currency, not just the US.

Interesting. Thank you.

Thanks for the link!
I did actually stumble across this when doing my own research. This actually convinced me to create this post because it was the *only* thread I could find trying to address this issue and most replies seemed a little... undeveloped?
People to raise good, interesting points on certain aspect of the pros - but they all seem to ignore the underlying fact that a deflationary currency goes completely against our economic model - and no one addresses these known issues.
For example, a couple people talk about how it would be better for the environment, while this is true, it's very much linked to the fact it would lead to higher unemployment, so it's not really a solution is it? So it's kind of like finding a niche benefit from a substantial, unresolved issue.
Just my opinion.

Thanks for the extensive response!
Just for the record, I didn't mean for my comments to sound like statements, they were more like subtle questions.
So I understand that a deflationary system is yet to actually be demonstrated on a wide-scale, and before we see widespread adoption, it will all be speculation. 
BUT, we do have examples of temporary deflationary economies, such as the US back during the great depression, and from what I've read (I'm no economist so all my information is simply regurgitated opinions), it seems to be well understood that when the value of money increases in your piggy bank, there is **less** incentive to use it (not zero incentive - just less than there would be in an inflationary system) which automatically translates into a lower aggregate GDP, and GDP is our best measurement of success in an economy, is it not?
Regarding some of your points - loans are not necessarily a good thing, but the way I see it, the demand for loans will always be there. And a deflationary system simply makes it harder for an individual to pay back said loans. I did not consider your point about lower demand effecting prices though, thanks for that.
Lower employment was just regurgitated information I read. It links to the idea that aggregate demand is lower, so people spend less, so economic stimulation is low, thereby hinders employment. Why would a company be hiring more people if there revenue is decreasing over time? I still think this is a valid concern.
Regarding investments, you are right in that it is a balancing act - finding what will still be profitable to invest in, and there will definitely still be investments. But I don't think one can just dismiss the fact that it will still be less profitable to invest than in a, say, inflationary system. This seems to make sense to me, and it would not be a good thing for the economy, right?
Regarding the propaganda aspect of it, I fully agree, we are being led by people making a significant profit off the current system, and I very much want to believe in an economy that doesn't force useless spending and generate sheep-like behaviors (trust me I know people that spend money on things they *really* dont need, and definitely can't afford) which is why I'm attempting to educate myself on what seems to be the most critical/uncertain aspect of the functionality of BTC.
Thanks for your time! Hope my comments aren't just taking us in a circle, little tight on time so i can't proof read D:

Each dividend already has it's own name, change the definition of bitcoin would be a terrible, terrible idea. 
Just try referring to mBTC (/1000) more frequently, and soon mBTC will be the norm :)

ELI5 how is this possible?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:27:30
I'm no banking expert, but is there no possible way for someone to have, say, a bank account setup in Korea and the US, to the point they can essentially just generate infinite wealth from this massive discrepancy?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:06
One day. As of right now btc is one of the most unstable currencies out there hehe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:40:15
we ARE at 14k. - and greetings future person who tells me we are at 15k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:10:39
But what exactly makes you think he burnt out all his crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:53:48
Yes bitcoin is a very real asset. It works the same as any company share would. You buy it for whatever price someone sells it to you for (wont be below $15k anymore) and you sell it for whatever price someone will buy it for (or hold it till you can get all the pussy and coke for bitcoin)
edit: i realize comparing bitcoin currency to a company stock is triggering for some people, just thought it might help this person understand, assuming he/she isn't trolling.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:43:45
Fair enough. I just want to make it clear I very much believe in the blockchain as well. Just have specific concerns with the eventual widespread adoption of btc.
I suppose time will tell. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:28:33
Yeah so this article very much affirms my understanding in that, while everything is technically possible, a deflationary currency does still go against our current understanding of economics and that deflationary cryptos will likely serve more like gold, or a storage of value, rather than an actual currency.
I don't spend a huge amount of time on this subreddit. What is the general consensus in the BTC community about this? Is referring to it as gold met with a negative response? do people believe BTC will take over the dollar? I did hear Charlie Lee pretty much say this on CNBC yesterday.
I'm just curious at how people treat this longterm, or if most people, even in the btc community, are treating btc like a stock or commodity to flip for a quick buck, which would lead to a disastrous bubble if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:33:56
I fully agree with this. But I think this is more focused on how there's demand for a decentralized currency, to protect yourself from malicious corrupt banking systems, not necessarily at all related to a demand for a deflationary currency. There are other deflationary cryptos out there that seem to fit our economic model better, allowing for a less dramatic cultural shift. 
My concern was specifically on BTC, not cryptos as a whole (I'm a strong believer). I am simply trying to picture BTC adoption on a national scale. 
Why would a deflationary crypto 'beat' a more standard, inflationary crypto?
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:03:29
I've brought this up many times when trying to learn about bitcoin specifically, and NEVER received a direct/rational answer about how it would be a viable mainstream peer to peer currency. I'm not trying to FUD, I would still be very much interested in any real response about the deflationary issue.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:01:44
What do you mean by this though. Fiat trading is the only way we can study how a deflationary currency effects the economy, since commodity based trading is entirely different, no?
We can look at ancient Rome, where they implemented and utilized actual currency. Their silver coins were deflationary, and thereby increased in value overtime and were purchased and hoarded by the rich, kept away from circulation and the general public. It makes no sense to assume this wouldn't be the case again.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:57:55
But real fiat currency can be manipulated through intentional inflation or deflation. It has been very well established through real world application that a deflationary currency decentivizes investing and spending, thereby fails to stimulate the economy. There are very few 'pros' to a deflationary currency. Bitcoin is basically electronic gold, but as a national, or mainstream p2p currency, it goes very much against our understanding of economics.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:03:43
Not how this works unfortunately
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:22:05
Real world proven economics, yes.
