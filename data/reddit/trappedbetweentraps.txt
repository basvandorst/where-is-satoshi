The lower cap could be 0 or 100 trillion and the upper cap could be one unit more more than the lower cap or 100 gogool. Without these reference points the whole slope could be covering only cents or all the money ever put into existence, which changes the meaning of the graph quite a bit.

That chart is meaningless as it doesn't have any units on the y-axis.

That looks quite interesting but I wonder how one supposed to read this graph? Also any pointers to the underlying modeling concept would be much appreciated.

The word you are looking for is 'propaganda' .

Indeed, OPs definition of 'worth' is missing therefore everyone will pick one off the top of their mind and share advice possibly without sharing their definition at the same time.
So I k have a go as well. Any amount will get you invested and you can explore the technology hands on. Research where and how to acquire, move some money across wallets and set you own goals on the way (like minimising fees in the first and or all future transanctions). 
You won't get rich with the $10 investment in a monitary sense but you will likely learn a lot, which will shape your future decisions. Is $10 learnings worth it? That will depend on how you use your knowledge down the track but it could turn out to be the best 'tuition fee' you ever paid.
