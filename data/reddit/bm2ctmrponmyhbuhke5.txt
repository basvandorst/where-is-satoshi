But there *are* third parties verifying the ID as I presented it -- friends, family, doctors, authorities, etc. If someone gives an ID, and does you false, then you take the ID address to some authority, they look up the signers and talk to them about the person's whereabouts. Honestly, it's not that much different from a state ID, except that other people can sign it (so you have a record of known associates) and a person doesn't have to give *all* their information (address, birthdate, permit to drive, etc) when they just want a drink.

Interesting, but not as general as I was thinking. There is some problem with a general Merkle DAG -- mining fees. I think it could be fixed, but one has to decide who gets the fees for a transaction in parallel blocks. Note that it doesn't matter if a "free" transaction is in parallel blocks -- it just gets recorded twice. Perhaps one could incentivize the join of blocks by giving the joiner fees from parallel blocks -- seems complicated. Also, mining rewards become a problem -- though perhaps there is a way for nodes to "declare" what they think is the "main chain." Anyway, the math is fine, but the incentives aren't clear.

I've looked at OneName and that's what got me started on the idea -- but it doesn't seem very secure -- the information itself is apparently stored online rather than just the hashes. It certainly doesn't have the authentication protocols I mentioned.

I was thinking that it would be necessary to create a complete join from time to time, but the "family" analogy is pretty good. They say that after many generations you are either an ancestor to everyone or no one -- this is the main thing to check to consider a block completely "valid" -- is it (it's hash) an ancestor to every "current" block.

No, what I'm talking about is not a statist concept -- it simply allows you to leverage your reputation where your face isn't known. We will always need a way to prove our reputation, for loans for example. This is essentially a "self-issued" ID with only the hashes of information stored online -- but you control the information -- and who signs it as valid. You could have only a public/private key pair if that's enough for your business, but this allows for secure multifactor authentication with humans in the loop.
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:53:52
We just have to make a distributed system like I describe -- where people don't have to have any trusted third party store their private ID information (only the hashes need be stored publically). No government has any interest in a system where you control your ID and they only (can/sometimes) act as a "well-respected" certifier.
@_date: 2015-12-14 23:18:46
Fungibility is related to anonymity, but it's possible to have fungibility without anonymity. Two ways:
1. Make it exponentially hard (even given 80% mining power) to remove blocks.
2. Use a Merkle DAG structure instead of a chain -- this allows small miners to contribute directly and "authorize" transactions that other miners won't.

Not sure how Ethereum would do this. But with the system I was talking about (and the video put out on YT in July), it would be perfectly possible to create a "clean" ID at any time. It would just take time to "establish" it -- getting other people to sign that the picture is good, your transactions/credit is good, etc. The main point of my idea is to have a "private" ID -- which is very difficult to steal -- this is part of wbn's idea as well, I think, but he says something more like "impossible to lose."
So you can start over, but not steal another person's ID under these systems.

Good to see someone is thinking about this. I've been reading about zfs and ipfs recently and realized that using a more general structure (I think it's eventually a lattice in this case) might be useful. If the incentive structure is decent -- and it seems the only way to do it is share the mining fees at an appropriate join -- then it would greatly benefit decentralization and enable higher transaction volume.

You're right, I was thinking of the consequence rather than the definition. Unfortunately, as long as bitcoin transactions are recorded for all time and addresses are only pseudonymous we have a problem with indistinguishability. Of course always using new addresses helps with that. Anyway, thanks for the reminder/correction.

Fine, don't trust any ID without a state signature -- done. But maybe you run a bar and I don't want to show your doorman my address -- the current ID system doesn't allow that.

Fungibility is the ability to spend your money like any other money. Both of these help prevent censorship. What they don't prevent, and only anonymity guarantees, is that everyone is willing to take your money (this is also necessary). The DAG also helps with scaling.

It has to be a *good* store of value, but not a *great* one -- or even *gain* significant value. Don't get me wrong, I *like* bitcoin, and that it has a limited supply, but I think there *might* be room for other coins with either a steady (whether sub-linear, linear or even super-linear), *predictable* (i.e. not based on the decisions of a cartel) growth or market controlled growth of monetary supply. My point is that if a seller gives me choice to trade either an appreciating asset or a depreciating one, then clearly I will trade the depreciating asset. On the other hand, the seller would like to accept an appreciating asset, but would likely accept a depreciating one if that depreciation was both predictable and not too fast ... and he expects to use it for change and other expenses in the near future. ... Let there be a hundred different coins with different supply schedules and may the best one(s) win, I'm reasonably sure bitcoin will be one of them.

Yes, this does not allow one to "find" a person -- unless they allow some of their information to be held in "clear" in a third party (government) or public database. It cannot be used to find or prosecute con men -- it is useful only to establish authentication/trust in a trustless way, e.g. for a loan or to get into a bar.
The fact remains that one should not trust someone with much if you haven't really established a relationship with them. No ID system changes that. If people can't be bothered to check a person's reputation before doing business with them, then ...
But, yes, you're right in that con men are bad and it's good to catch them. But we have a problem with placing too much trust in the current ID system which is easy to forge -- were we able to directly access the system to verify a person perhaps we would judge a person more carefully.
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:24:35
No, I understand it's passive and doesn't require trust in a third party mixer. As far as I can tell it mixes the inputs of a block and divides them into the appropriate outputs, but that's as far as (I think) I've understood. I'm not sure where the mixing is "computed" -- it has to be at least partly in the wallet or it's not really anonymous. Do you know any good explanations -- I didn't see one on the website last I looked.

Yeah, it's also clear we'll have to deal with bloat -- I haven't completely understood the part about trimming the "transaction braid" in the paper. ... Just realized that the transactions themselves actually form essentially the same braid structure. Dealing with bloat will probably have to be done via a torrent like structure (essentially storing a single strand of the braid ... cutting off the old parts at some point) ... I guess one would be storing a "local strand" ... I don't know the details, but I guess mobile wallets do a version of this already.

And it's stupid to trust someone without a well-established ID. Here you cannot prevent someone from starting a new ID (so all their sins may be washed away) -- but if it's established then you can be (more) sure it's them (rather than just trusting a document that can be easily forged). Assuming you have access to the internet, you can check *yourself* whether their ID exists and it's reputation -- you need not trust a government to properly manage an ID system.

Yes, *keys* sign, but you look for keys you trust then -- I'm not saying you should trust signatures you've never seen before.
Part of the point *is* that the cost is nearly zero -- that one can become "documented" to some extent without much cost to anybody.
Finally, you can always have the state sign (parts of) your ID (perhaps they even backup the parts they want on their own server) -- then this ID *is* a state ID, i.e. certified by the state. It doesn't preclude state ID/certification, it just *allows* certification by other trusted parties.
The state could even use such a system to authorize a person for different things, e.g. different levels of security, and, again, a person could use one ID but not show that they have a very high level of security clearance when only a low level is needed. Or, with ring signatures, they could show that they are certified by the military, but not which branch. ...

@_date: 2015-12-23 13:51:31
You haven't read my post in CryptoAnarchy. A person provides information (securely) for their ID, then multiple third parties sign it (i.e. certify it). If I trust one of (or a quorum of) the signers then I trust the ID. The ID is "self-issued" in that the person controls what information goes into it and what they allow others to see as a part of identification/authentication -- but it has to be "certified" (i.e. signed) by others. Perhaps many others (family, friends, doctors) or an "authority." A particular (advanced) benefit is that one can use ring signatures for these -- where I don't know exactly who signed his ID (e.g. USA, UK or Italy) but I would trust any of them. Or, similarly, this guy has *t* of  *n* signatures so I trust him amount *t*'.

If they only differ at the top block -- the same way they do now -- first block *they* received. But if they later "receive" a chain two blocks longer, they throw the shorter away. Where it gets difficult is if nodes disagree on more than that -- then they keep mining their own chain until they see not just a longer chain, but an exponentially longer chain.
This means the whole network *really* needs to agree on the blocks two or so down. Notice that the base of the exponent can be tuned to keep this manageable.
The main thing is that a person cannot just mine the same length of chain as it takes their goods to arrive -- during the time the goods are on the way and without extra mining costs!

Said this on but should be said here too:
"Bitcoin is built on trustlessness -- or rather, the trust that relatively large groups of people will seek "selfish" gains rather than collude.
I like most of D'Angelo's ideas, but this one (electing representatives) is terrible. Anonymity with bitcoin (in the current implementation) may require some trust (e.g. in a mixer), but decentralization doesn't require both a complete breech of anonymity and total trust.
I honestly don't know many of the details of the current bitcoin implementation. The change (or constant change) of hashing algorithm doesn't sound bad to me. Apparently we know where each block is mined -- might it be possible to exclude miners from the same location as the last block?
This would be a much bigger change, perhaps not implementable in bitcoin: One could give smaller blocks (or smaller totals) a difficultly which is less (with less reward perhaps). Perhaps there is a way to encourage miners to at least concentrate on mining "local" transactions -- though with a block confirmation of 10 minutes, this doesn't seem to work."
Reply by James: "I agree that my idea of identity mining is a terrifying concept. I hate it personally. Unfortunately it might just be a requirement.
Again we know decentralization is essential for censorship resistance, yet no one in Bitcoin can honestly state that Bitcoin is currently decentralized. And we do know that it's been on a very fast centralizing pace for three years now. So in order to keep the most important aspects of Bitcoin we need to act accordingly.
The silver lining, however, is HUGE. Identity-based mining scales almost to infinity (as individual, elected miners would not use/need proof of work – they could mine a billion transactions in ten minutes, or more)"
My reply: "James, it's the most terrifying idea for bitcoin that I have ever heard. I like the idea of some miners being identifiable since it would help show decentralization. (Note: I don't really see a way to give each miner signature -- IPs can be spoofed and one can always use a new address for each block.) I also like the idea of somehow making mining easier for certain people (hobbyists with small machines) -- this would help to make the network more decentralized. Personally, I would mine (even without a reward) if I thought there were any chance of ever mining a block. I'm also not in favor of large mining pools -- we've already had one pool mine six consecutive blocks and intentionally restrict its size. We also have no idea whether the Chinese machines are actually in a "pool" or not.
Speaking of pools, I'm not entirely sure how they are organized, but it seems that an important part of the implementation would be to avoid multiple guesses of the same nonce. One hopes that the standard mining software doesn't have every machine guessing the same sequence of possible nonces.
The point is, if we want decentralization we have to make it possible for small machines to mine (without a pool). Placing our trust in a "few" proven miners is just another form of centralization. They may have our trust now, but their circumstances may change. No, for the long term I would rather trust the faceless masses to seek profit."

Openess of the code is necessary.
Centralization of mining is inevitable -- to some degree.
Therefore, decentralization of the blockchain record -- and **great** difficulty in changing deep blocks is necessary.
More privacy needs to be built in -- pseudonymity is not enough.
@_date: 2015-11-13 15:20:44
The same as now -- it's unlikely the next block will be instantaneous with another and this will correct the "wrong" half. Again, the top few blocks are "mobil" -- only when a block is a bit older does the "exponential difficulty to change" really kick in.
The point is: Power will be centralized -- but the reality (the record of power) must be decentralized -- and (exponentially) difficult to change.

This is kind of interesting, but probably not useful in many areas of state governance. It's important for votes to be anonymous, for example. This precludes absolute accountability. You might look at James D'Angelo's video about this: 
Basically, this is simply a tree structure for each issue. This assumes that one can trust a single person "above" you to make the right decision (or right delegation) on an issue -- giving that person the strength of all the votes below them on the tree, I guess. However, I might not think that a single person is capable of expressing my thoughts or even understanding a particular issue. Also, choosing only one delegate can still lead to a sort of "first past the post"/two party problem. Better to give each person 10 "delegation points" which they can distribute as they like to their chosen delegates (even to themselves, of course) -- creating a ranked lattice of delegation for each issue.
One still has the problem that delegates will have to "run" for office, if they want to have enough delegation points to decide the issue. However, there is some benefit in that their campaign will probably focus more on issues -- that way perhaps they can push the issue through without even gaining all the delegation points for themselves.

If we're understanding each other, then in some sense, yes. But this is true of bitcoin now as well. If an attacker has 51% of the CPU power then he has a great deal of control over the tip of the chain. But as it stands now, if an attacker has 80% of the CPU power he could not only control the tip of the chain, but actually "go back in time" -- with the work required to do that only linear in the amount of blocks he wanted to change. 
Example: If I had 80% of the CPU power now, then I could buy something with bitcoin, and supposing I got the goods a day later then I could begin mining "in the past" and have to mine only 24 hours and 10 mins worth of blocks to reverse the transaction -- without losing any mining fees! (They would be delayed by a day, of course.) If an older block required O(*2^n*) blocks above it to change then I would have to mine on the order of 100 years of transactions to reverse yesterday's purchase.

Thoughts on bitmessage?
@_date: 2015-11-13 14:15:17
Reading through the white-paper, I've noticed several times that Satoshi assumed most nodes on the network would be honest -- an assumption that has led to the famous 51% attack.
The Proof-of-Work section of the white-paper is particularly interesting. Satoshi compares voting via IP address versus work and says: "Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote." This is true (under the current implementation), but Satoshi neglects to consider that those with the most or cheapest resources (money, electricity, etc) will quickly outpace others in the ability to do work -- resources are energy are work are information.
We know that currently access to most of the worlds resources are kept in a few hands -- and bitcoin will not change this. We might assume that access to resources -- and therefore CPU power -- will follow a power law distribution. (Can one check this empirically?) We must make the network able to withstand a "51% attack" even in these conditions. As an example, suppose 80% of the computing power is in the hands of 20% of the miners. There is no way to completely prevent the collusion of those 20% -- but we must make it very expensive -- to the point of destroying bitcoin (in some years).
I see essentially one way to do this: change how the blockchain is updated. The cement of the blockchain must be stronger. As I understand it, to perform a 51% attack at the moment one must begin mining a new chain and -- once one has received the goods and mined a longer chain than the rest -- one distributes the new, longer, chain. Several layers of the blockchain are then replaced at once -- the "cement" at each layer being no stronger than the "cement" of the top layer.
Instead, I would suggest that a block *n* deep in the chain require O(*2^n*) new blocks above it. So that a new top block is immediately accepted, but if one wants to change the top block, one must supply two new blocks, etc. Waiting the standard 6 confirmations (1 hour) would then cement the transaction not by an hour of work, but by 2^6 ~= 10 hours of work. Waiting an entire day would require producing a chain of more than a hundred years of transactions -- not just a chain of 24 hours and 10 mins.
I realize scalability is a big issue right now, but decentralization is as well. However, decentralization is a problem we'll never truly solve without regulation. One of the main problems with centralization is the 51% double-spend attack, I think this would address that problem without resorting to regulation.

Decentralization of CPU power won't be long term anyway -- but decentralization of blockchain storage and increasing the difficulty of changing relatively deep blocks is necessary.

You have to assume your lower blocks are correct -- unless you get truly overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The top few blocks are still relatively mobile -- but we must assume that older blocks have been distributed to all the network and are more correct.
@_date: 2015-11-13 14:18:40
In this case you don't, you just wait to see which has one added to it -- then you use the longer chain. That's why I say O(*2^n*) -- the top couple of block may need a bit of room to move.

Maybe bitmessage.
@_date: 2015-11-13 18:31:55
This idea doesn't protect against censorship a lot -- some obviously -- but, as in the example, if 80% of the computing power is against you, you'll need to wait 5 blocks before your transaction is likely to be added ... only to be kicked off again when the 80% mine another block. So you'll need an average of 25 blocks to get one above yours and be "relatively" safe.
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:15:02
Why? There would be a consensus up until the last few blocks -- just like now, no?
@_date: 2015-11-12 10:35:22
James may be correct, there may not be a way to have *provably* "decentralized" mining other than by identity, but his idea introduces another form of centralization.
There are other ways to reduce centralization, which are not provable, but statistically good enough:
1. Don't allow consecutive blocks from the same ip/region. (Hard to implement with Tor/ip spoofing.)
2.  Use a different proof of work hash function.
3. Allow some blocks to be mined for zero reward at very low difficulty so there is a non-zero chance of a hobbyist mining some blocks.
Related to using small machines, at some point we won't be able to have "full" nodes -- the blockchain will be too big. A node will have to store only the Merkel branches of interest to it (local ones and large ones). Miners will then only be "able" (in a reasonable time) to confirm those transactions which attach to their current trees -- giving the network a much more distributed and local flavor. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:27:32
I don't know what the *next* issues are, but two issues are:
1. We cannot afford to store the entire history of every satoshi for all time. (This also affects fungibility.)
2. Space is time. The time required for a transaction to process affects how large the network can be. The more time each block takes, the larger the network can be. This doesn't much affect us here as communication to the other side of the Earth takes less than a second. But at some point we may need some "local" coins as well as a "universal" coin.
@_date: 2015-11-15 13:35:46
You're dreaming, but in a way you're right. I'm saying that distributed consensus *is* possible -- and *necessary* -- even if CPU power is not. Power/resources may not be distributed -- but consensus of what is past must be.
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:39:44
Yes, I know. But currently one simply chooses a longer chain -- even if it would replace several of the top blocks on one's own chain. One should allow a new block on top if the hash is correct, but it should be progressively harder to replace blocks which are further down.
@_date: 2015-11-09 16:49:46
Some of you are saying a miner could create a huge block. How? He can't put extra transactions/information in (unless he moves his own BTC a lot) can he? Also, someone has mentioned that a small block would take less time to distribute -- making it more likely to be the "accepted" block. An additional question/comment: Clearly the difficultly of the hash is not a function of the block size.

Did you read the post? I'm well aware of the post on the front page -- I've made several comments on it (yesterday). This is quite a thorough answer to that post, a rebuttal of the possibility of decentralization, and a way to live with centralization that would be a big change to the core.

That's not possible. Elect a "Board of Trusted Miners" like James D'Angelo wants to and you get a different kind of centralization. Those with more resources will always have more ability to effect action -- in the present. We have to make **the past** (the lower blocks) exponentially hard to change.
