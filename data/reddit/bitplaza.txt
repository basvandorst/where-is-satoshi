Hello there,
Thanks for your message, well, first of all if you look at our design, it's much more simplified for buyers and sellers, we are trying to open the gates of Bitcoin to the mass, we hope to increase the adoption and use of Bitcoins by making the process as seamless and clear as possible.
Not only that, but our system is designed to protect the sellers and buyers from price fluctuations, we all know that the price of bitcoins is not stable and that's why we use pound sterling as the base currency, when a buyer purchases an item, the amount will automatically be converted at mid-market rates, once we release the payment to you, you will receive your payment in bitcoins (based on the pound sterling price at mid market rates).
We think this as a whole is an entirely different package to what our competitors offer and we believe that we can help expand the use of bitcoin.
In the future we will announce new features which are currently in development.
Please use our Facebook or Twitter page to follow us for updates.
If you require any type of support please feel free to contact us.

Hello Jaynemesis,
Thanks for your feedback, we really appreciate it, no you are right, we will make improvements to the website with your feedback.
To add a product you can go to the sell area, then click on submit a product.
You will have a page open that you can set the selling price (in pound sterling), all of the listing are currently set in a buy it now format, perhaps in the future we will set a system up for bidding.
To set the shipping costs, click on the shipping tab when editing the product and click on enable per-product shipping, you can then set the shipping rates for different countries by clicking on insert row.
I hope this information has been useful to you and if you require any type of support please feel free to contact us.

Hello John_Alan,
Thanks for your message,  we currently take 1.5% comission on the pound sterling listed price of your product, so if you list a MacBook Pro for £800.00 and it sells we will take a £12.00 comission (given to you in a BitCoin payment at mid market rates).
Here's the answers to your questions:
1) Buyers will feel more safe purchasing products using BitPlaza as we act as a safeguard agaisnt fraudulent sellers by making all payments protected by our Escrow system.
2) That's essentially what we do, once a buyer sends their payment for their order, you will be notified and be required to dispatch the order, preferably via a tracked post.
3) If you dont dispatch the product, the buyer will notify us and we will begin to mediate the escrow claim by asking you for your side of the case and the buyers side of the case, we promise to try to find a amicable solution for both parties.
4) Similarly to question 3, we will listen to both sides of the case, we will examine all the evidence provided and try to find an appropriate solution.
If you have any more questions or require support feel free to use the contact us page to message us.
