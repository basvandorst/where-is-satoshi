If you're not getting anything you're not doing it right. When the big hubs get released mark my words they will be charging fees. No one puts away 1k+ btc in a Lightning node and effectively gets nothing for it.
Edit: tough pull to swallow isn't it who do it know that will lock up 1.4million dollars to help the public with microtransactions for free lmao PLEASE TELL ME

Bitcoin was never suppose to allow whales to self sustain by holding coins it was meant to be spent. The end game of cryptocurrency has always been to spend it at mom and pops local store or amazon or walgreens. The endgame isn't to turn it into USD. More people realize this and why bitcoin cash is the answer.

It was a joke. I only hold BCH anyways.

I don't think we should be increasing the block size, how will I run a full node I only have a 250gb hard drive... I won't be able to run one if the blockchain gets too big...

If the onchain transaction just worked and were low fee like they were always meant to be you wouldn't need a clearing house. I don't understand how this is going over you guys's heads.

Are you serious it has everything to do with finfet technology. You literally don't understand what finfet technology is or your purposely trolling. End of conversation people who want to be ignorant will do so willingly.
Edit: anything that uses processors, circuits, circuit boards, compacitors, and processing units is finfet
BTW graphics manufacturers are now down to 7nm once they exhaust Moore's law quantum computing is the next step. Which will increase the communication speed between different processors exponentially. I'm not going to explain this you can Google and educate yourself. I'm blocking you.

I know, now they won't have to loan out money by holding all the money and faciliating all the transactions offchain they will just collect the transaction fees that the miners rightfully deserve. They literally will be rewarded by holding a "big bag of coins" and acting as a hub for people to interface on. Once again a third party they does nothing but drain\skim money off the top. The miners are expending capital to purchase hardware and paying for electricity to process the onchain transactions.

Shhhh don't given them ideas lmao

We aren't hired we understand the true Bitcoin vision and are trying to stop this have mind from becoming r/The_Donald 2.0

I don't think you understand how cheap storage is becoming you should look up Moore's law and how it applies to hard drives.

You will have to use their services to be extending a tab "A line of credit" to all your local places that accept bitcoin. Because let's face it do you want to do 10 transaction on chain at an average cost of today (40 dollars  or would you rather do one onchain transaction a week and be extended a line of credit basically(the payment channel). The lightning network still requires atleast 1 on chain transaction to initiate the payment channel then you can piece whatever amount you wager to multiple different entities, and guess what they will charge you transaction fees that are lower than the onchain one but still exist. Who the hell is going to run a lightning hub for free.

Did you know that 30 years ago a gb of storage was equivalent to a million dollars and today it's 5-10cents in 5-10 years it will be fractions of a penny. Just let that sink in FRACTIONS OF A PENNY
Edit: I can easily see my next computer build in 5 years having 1-4tb for a main hard drive and my backup will be 20-40tb EASILY that's for a 4-6k build if I'm pulling that and average builds right now do 500main hd and 1-2tb storage hd wtf do you think a 1-2k build will be in 5 years prob 1-2tb main and 5-15storage. 
Part of being smart is being able to admit when your wrong and move on. You don't have to burn with the ship only stupid people stay in a boat when it's compromised and sinking all the smart people are getting on life boats which is bch in this instance.

I guess your the savior then go ahead and wager your 1.4m dollars for the public to have free payment channels. Never minding the fact when you run a lightning node you can't use those coins wagered they get locked up to provide liquidity. What a sound investment hell while you're at it put some money in your checking account you know basically your whole 401k get those awesome annual bank returns at year end...
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:35:11
In 5 years time my next build will probably be a 2tb main hard drive and a 20-30tb backup

That's the problem with the IRS. How convenient is it that in every other court your innocent until proven guilty except when it comes to them. You're literally guilty until you prove your innocence.

Asking the real questions here. ^^

Don't be retarded buy from Alibaba or the source...
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:27:40
C and c++ aren't terrible they just require you to be good and not average. Most programmers are average...
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:25:12
Ugh maybe bitmain... Who else would be the source. Why did I even have to answer that...
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:33:03
This, only a non would call c a terrible language. He probably loves Python...
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:34:52
The source is quite obviously the manufacturer msrp...

Kodi well not be replacing Netflix. 
Edit: as long as they keep producing slows like Orange is the New Black, stranger things they aren't going anywhere

I can't wait until they owners of lightning network tell me I can no longer redeem my certificate for the underlying asset!!!!

Cryptocurrency the stock that doesn't pay dividends lmao.

Tumble the BTC and send it to her into a fresh wallet. Problem solved 0 traces left.

Crpyto in general isn't going to lose. Because it's based in mathematics and fair. Point blank; fiat has nothing that sound money has. Crypto is the return of sound money.
Edit: when things based in math and science lose. We get farenheit 451 or 1984.

Good luck on surviving to 2112 or somewhere in that area.
