"Bitcoin - a revolution disguised as a get rich quick scheme" - some person before me.

I've bought a small amount of LTC, BTC, and ETH = ~1400 USD total spent/Worth about 950$USD now. I bought all of this on Coinbase and have it stored on GDAX, but really don't know how to tx to a wallet. I could do more research, but honestly I'm pretty unsavvy w/ tech/coding/etc. Halp? I want to hodl and build stash over the longer term.

Consumerism doesn't drive innovation - passion does. The framework of the internet was in place during the boomers coming of age period, and the idea of the internet was around for 100 years before that. Capitalism is falsely credited with enabling innovation. It's not like there are any other mass systems in place to know how innovation works outside of capitalism.

You're right though - passion counts for nothing with noone to sell to - in a capitalist system. This = my whole point.

I'm not arguing for a totalitarian oppressive regime. I'm saying that there hasn't been a good example (much less an example at scale) of any other system. 
Sales are not what drives innovation. Many revolutionary inventions have happened without any promise of profits.
Seems like you're just boot-licking the system because it is the dominant one.

It already is. If you're breathing, you're paying for it.

The whole internet is roughly at the early/late majority crux right now, as roughly half of the world has internet access.

Only bc you don't understand the concept.

It wasn't an assumption. Ever heard of the diffusion of innovations? 
Everything has a target market. It's the number of people you can reasonably expect to adopt an innovation. Even USD - the most widely used currency in the world atm, cannot have full adoption with respect to the world population. 
With the exception of a singularly used world currency (doubtful), no currency will ever have full adoption by all people. Even then, some people intentionally don't participate, which would also prevent full adoption.

It's 100% adoption of the target market. You are assuming the target market is the world's population. Granted - the op didn't clarify source of maths or the target market - but it seems fairly obvious the target market isn't the entire world pop.
