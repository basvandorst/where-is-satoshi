Yeah i took 2/3 of my position off the table. Waiting for the correction. Missed out on that 1k uptick in the last 8 hours tho

So what should my biggest concern be here about the pending hard fork? Currently trade on GDAX. I’ve heard people say move all btc to a wallet and wait it out or am I️ ok to continue trading? Price swings I️ assume will happen but are people calling for a major movement? I️ agree it’s confusing and I️ only know so much.

I️ have a wallet (bread) but keep most on coinbase. Thanks for the help!

I just downloaded bread wallet for IOS. Is that the bitcoin core wallet? Are there different versions of bread wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:39:14
Yeah it’s a little disconcerting and annoying
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:32:41
It is concerning for sure.  Also I get a minor heart attack when my account shows zero coins and then I switch between currencies and it pops up haha

Great thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:48:55

@_date: 2017-09-29 00:44:48
Worked! Thanks!

I agree I have orders I to buy on the dip here. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:43:37
So I moved some btc to bread and status says not confirmed on block chain. How do I confirm it? Is there a way? (Sorry for the novice question)
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:15:05
Try restarting your computer ( if you’re using one)
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:07:54
How can I do this on coinbase?
