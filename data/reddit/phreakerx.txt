Iono, 2014-2016 didn't go up nearly as much as I thought. The way we blazed through 10k last year didn't feel real.
There was always round number support and I feel like 5-15k there was none, literally I blinked and it went over 10k lol. I kept telling my business partner that this reminded me of right before the Gox collapse. I think once LN comes to fruition is when we see our next explosion. /Long time hodler

I really do love a good conspiracy! Unfortunately for Mark some of us pay attention to what he and others say and have said. Don't paint him as the bad guy? The government seized the coins? Tx Malleability? Each statement by itself doesn't seem that mutually exclusive but they are when taken together. People are mad at MT Gox for many reasons but the biggest is a bunch of BTC when missing. Whoever was suppose to do the book keeping over multiple years for a multi-million dollar business was no where to be found, ever. Even if Mark did hire a bookkeeper (which, in viewing 3rd party sources seems to be a negative) he was responsible for MT Gox and it's assets. If Mark honestly never looked in the books to keep his "bookkeeper" truthful, he is still at fault for incompetence. This coupled with the facts that Mark lied to the XBT community readily and repeatedly previous to the implosion make me start to wonder if it's just one man lying to me or if it's the other 1000's Mark is stating. Having already been tried and convicted for fraud in France doesn't really improve his marks for truthfulness either. 
TL:DR I can use my BS flyswatter to swat away the flies that is Mark's BS. Any questions? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:04:10
TL:DR of Mark's post "Didn't you guys learn anything from me screwing you so hard?" Mark is trying to tell us how to fix what's wrong with XBT? Funny how the only time I lost coin was through him! Maybe we should tell him how to fix TX Malleability, lol. What happened to all the "It's a conspiracy" people from yesterday? Did the government make him write this too? This is one more piece of evidence that Mark is so out of touch with reality that he views himself as the hero fighting against the perils of evil, here to rescue us from the error of our ways. I wonder if he was trying to save Eurocenter too?

I like this analogy. 
So does the Casino pay the tax on the $1000 chip when they mint it? 
It would seem that IRS is telling us to do this.
I was under the impression that manufactures don't pay the  product tax. The tax is paid by the person buying the product. In this frame of reference with bitcoin as the product why are we being taxed when we make the bitcoin and not only when it's bought. Maybe I am missing something, I do that sometimes, but that's why I asked this here.

Wow, thank you. I really didn't expect a reply from a 2 month old comment and definitely not that fast. My partner and I were affected by the Mt.Gox collapse and were pretty peeved about it for some time but the facts are; Bitcoin wouldn't be what it is today without you. Good luck to you in whatever you decide to do in your future. ( I am also patiently awaiting a book from you once the legal parts are done.)
@_date: 2016-12-09 04:03:59
I'm just showing that sometimes attack vectors exist that you wouldn't ever think of. The comment before this one was pretty much "accelerometer, big deal".

So if these tx have zero fees and they don't get included by x time; will the coin be lost for good or does it go back to its original wallet?

"The use of ASICBOOST could also explain why Bitmain’s main pool, AntPool, has been mining blocks roughly 100KB smaller than other mining pools of a comparative size during the month of February.
An unnamed source familiar with the matter told Bitcoin Magazine that the technique is easier to pull off when empty or nearly-empty blocks are mined."
These things are not the same.

Could have to do with that class action lawsuit.

Username and password will get you access to your mining pool. You will still need some kind of wallet info to get BTC.
You might be better off logging into pool and checking settings there, they might still have address. Gl!

Satoshi's whitepaper convinced me, it's on you if you think it's a myth. If you can edit out a bad actor you are not truly immutable or decentralized. If BTC, BCH or (whatever SegwitCoin is going to be called) ever tries to pull this shit I will gladly hop to the other chain.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:28:26
It was more about the why they chose BTC over other forms of money/crypto. I mean, Equifax hackers demand BTC and the amount "600" is included with a quote from said hackers on their motivation. What more would you like?

The design around LN is Alice wants to give Charlie a BTC. Alice and Charlie don't share a channel except through Bob.

So you tried it on one thread that just happened to bury a very controversial post by a "leader" in this sub? Strange to me that the a feature to bring controversial posts to the top would bury one of the largest offenders. I guess I must concede to Hanlon's razor until you do it again though.

It remains to be seen if BFL is as bad with money as they are with time tables, but think that they have chips coming out of their ears. That is an asset that is decreasing in value every day that they sit on it. That combined with the fact they don't have anything but the jalapeno done yet. I would sell chips too. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:45:47
USD was 12 weeks for us.
BTC was a little over a day.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:34:59
Same here. Their customer support is a joke too. Our BTC actually showed up on the blockchain before we got a response from gox.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:34:46
If you have money there, buy once the price  stops going down. Then take the coin and sell it somewhere else when it rebounds.
They take way too long and their customer support is nonexistent.  We will never deal with them again once these last few bucks are out of there. I feel like GOX and BFL should work together.
