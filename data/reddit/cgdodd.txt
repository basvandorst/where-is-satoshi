Do you mean dark market?
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:05:15
Gotcha. Makes sense. I have been trying to convince myself that if I lay down the money for a gaming rig it will pay for itself and then some. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:43:50
That's what she said.

Trillions of dollars in "public" debt IS counterfeiting. Paying for things with IOUs on behalf of future taxpayers with printed money that isn't earned. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:44:08
No, just unimportant. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:41:28
What he said.
@_date: 2014-08-24 03:50:30
Curious about this as well.. I remember a while back people here were hating on one of the cheap bitcoin swag sites because of delays and poor customer service.

If only we could get the rampant reposting problem under control. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:32:29
So essentially this guy is hoping to turn ~$850 into a house based on people making charitable exchanges with him? What value is this individual bringing to the world? This type of freeloading really annoys me. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:53:41
Thorough analysis as per usual. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 12:05:44
Thanks! Just downloaded it. Noticed a little unresponsiveness but it does seem to have a logical layout
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:08:07
Cool story bro. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:26:31
Doesn't look like they have a mobile app for starters. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:01:41
I'd love to see more economic incentives like this to spend my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:49:26
What are your goals with this project?
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:09:53
No, borrowing on the behalf of others and allowing them to foot the bill (i.e. counterfeit-induced inflation) will be *mostly* eliminated. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:48:06
Or an android app in the play store
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:06:21
Your claim is that sports is the way the community should spend there money. I disagree. What is wrong with what I'm doing? I don't get why you're getting so defensive. Did I insult you or something?
@_date: 2014-09-14 05:14:05
Sameszies. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:16:03
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:04:25
Can't that all happen in one thread?
@_date: 2014-01-12 04:49:17
I just don't understand why this is getting upvotes at all? Can this group have that many fakes?
@_date: 2014-04-09 02:02:20
Someone TIL'd about SEO!
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:01:11
Could you explain the value of such a tool? Is it something that part users will find useful or just developers?
@_date: 2014-05-07 11:16:02
It takes me infinity days to bill pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:51:51
"We" don't have anything. The people who made reddit do, and you're free to not be on reddit if people post things you don't want see. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:44:57
Twice the money that could go to helping people. Hell I'd rather crowdfund a startup than do this. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:55:33
If the worst thing about your day is that you saw Stefan Molyneux and Jeffrey Tucker talking about freedom you're doing pretty well. First world problems. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:43:24
Who is Mike Hearn?
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:50:03
I'm curious... Why not just downvote or unsubscribe instead of bitching about it? Do you think this comment is going to change anyone's mind?
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:13:11
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:35:08
I'd rather support a charity or mutual aid group. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 13:14:47
Does anyone know if there are more affordable hardware wallets like Trezor on the horizon?
@_date: 2014-08-24 17:41:21
This would be perfect in the daily thread.
@_date: 2014-05-24 12:59:59
Does this article have anything to do with Bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:44:10
So you're saying we should ignore them?
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:40:22
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:22:13
Awesome! Let me know when they hit 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, etc just to make sure you can count. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 23:50:20
I've been wondering the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:59:04
Nobody likes to respond to these questions. Tis bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:58:50
Thanks for doing this. It's a great idea. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:02:49
I've decided to go to Chicago next weekend.
To the moon!
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:47:37
Legally speaking, how difficult is it to run one of these in the US?
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:06:21
Thanks, but by that definition I'd need a MSB license to open a Coinbase account.
@_date: 2014-01-12 04:46:04
Thank you
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:15:07
My landlord is in her sixties. She probably would think I was trying to scam her. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:59:39
Any mention of cost to the user?
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:03:59
Just make your own and outcompete them. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:00:24
Is an android app in the pipeline?
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:54:48
The person who downvoted this likely has no conscience.
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:40:20
Those buttcoiners have a lot of time on their hands lol.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:57:40
tldr? I don't click ambiguously-titled links.
@_date: 2014-04-21 01:09:19
By the looks of these response, it seems like the government/media attempt at slandering Ross's character worked. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:01:38
Can we just get a sticky/sidebar for these posts? I feel like there is a new one every other day. Not saying it's not good news but damn. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:54:56
Do you not pay any bills online then?
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:12:55
For those of us not in the know... What is your podcast about? 
@_date: 2014-10-27 01:20:47
Please consider adding Republic Wireless. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:39:11
Thanks! Still didn't answer my question.. Do you think whining about this violation of rules helps? Did you PM a mod before your original comment??
EDIT: holding my breath. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:16:48
Can you share some screenshots??
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:36:53
Did you ever find a solution?
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:14:27
I'd pledge if I saw a business on there I use or want to support.
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:45:16
Thank you for saying this. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 03:25:37
Have they figured out a way around KYC/MSB stuff?
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:48:04
Dude I miss heatsync! Moved to Michigan, recently. Learned that Grand Rapids has the largest hackerspace.
@_date: 2014-09-05 01:13:37
This is why we need a daily/weekly discussion thread. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 04:41:14
Came here to say this, after down voting provably six or seven. I think I only need to hear a piece of news three times a day everyone.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:08:17
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:22:30
The existence of that button does not appear to have reduced any of the price speculation/apology around here though.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:59:53
Wow, really? This seems really ridiculous then.
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:02:55
I'm curious. Why didn't you just reply to the original thread you're responding too?
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:44:28
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:42:22
Based on my math, if I bought your rig right now and clocked what you're allegedly making it'd still take 90 days to break even... That's if nothing changes. Seems a little risky. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:42:30
Good one Buttcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:13:44
FYI you responded to "Dr. Fat Homo," whose first and only submission is in r/Buttcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:20:20
Sick burn Buttcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:15:56
Agreed. Obviously this would require  moderation support as well to be useful. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:35:13
IIRC I recommended something to try that may help the problem. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:58:59
They also actively use the government to force others out of the market. Morally bankrupt company in many respects. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:00:26
The existence of that sub does not appear to have reduced any of the price speculation/apology around here though.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:03:52
I have found a use for my dusty Nook Classic!!
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:09:09
Oh never mind then. That has actually happened. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:14:10
Cool, thanks for that. You are assuming that the location isn't taking a big cut (why wouldn't they?).
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:08:13
Are people buying these as investments or as charity? I can't see them making back thousands of dollars on transaction fees. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:57:36
In that view,  government is still illogical since the sociopaths would take over the government or elect other sociopaths into the government.
