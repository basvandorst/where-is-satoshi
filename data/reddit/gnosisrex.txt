In all sincerity, what would be the purpose of my having multiple accounts? I don't even understand a possible motive behind your accusation. It seems like you jump to disbelief when recently created accounts participate in discussion, so what makes you think anyone would create a bunch of new ones to do so? Your logic is tainted by paranoia. Aren't there thousands upon thousands of new Bitcoin users? Do you perceive yourself as a veteran with more valuable input because of your account age?
This IS my only reddit.com account. It was created after years of lurking on the site, and it's people like you, who would keep users like me from speaking my mind. From what I can tell, you are merely trying to control the conversation by dismissing perceived opposition. My witnessing such slimy tactics were a factor in me choosing to create an account, so here I am. We disagree. I'm a real person, and the only one speaking false here is you.

Downplaying the bigger blocks tech discussion and calling people shills is pretty dramatic too. People refer to the bitcoin core supporter community as nerds, so why not rely on the tech discussion rather than labels and bans?

It seems to be going pretty well so far.

Lol uh huh... the great wizard Roger Ver controls Chinese mining companies and South Korea both. Quake before his dread power.

And no one should refer to either fork as fraudulent, as OP does, because it detracts from legitimate discussion in favour of namecalling. New people are being misled and misinformed.

Your superiority complex is showing.

Ugh. You deserve to be broke when you laugh at others' misfortune. No one knows how the fork will play out. Personally, I use cryptocurrency to do business and thereby survive. I made the switch away from BTC because it became unaffordable for my business. Does that mean I deserve to be laughed at because I didn't successfully gamble the market like some wallstreet suit prick?
What drew me into Bitcoin was the vision. I originally got into it to stick it, in my own small way, to banksters. I closed my bank accounts and operate completely p2p. I'm dedicated to the project. Look around here and ask yourselves to what extent you've sold out the heart of the Bitcoin project. It never was about getting rich or superiority circlejerks.

I have begun to question this type of argument, and I am becoming quite skeptical of the "hodl" mentality as it regards the success of Bitcoin. Going joyriding on empty roads in the middle of the night doesn't really provide an accurate understanding of daily rush-hour traffic. It's true that BTC-Bitcoin works best when few people are using it, but are roads built to remain empty? Food for thought.
For example, during this last event, my Overstock.com order failed (with a $10 tx) because it didn't confirm within their window. An hour on the phone with their customer service and a subsequent refund doesn't really fix the overall problem, but I was told they're working with Shapeshift to accept other coins. Haven't tried that yet. Anyone know if this method works? In the meanwhile I have moved my funds to BCH-Bitcoin and ETH. Literally can't afford the fees or the drama anymore.

This is my only account, and I'm not "from" the other sub. For certain, I've been inspired by recent cryptodrama to create an account and participate in discussion. What is this "garbage" you speak of?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:42:09
Human for 32 years. Lurked for a long time and decided to participate recently. Thanks for the warm welcome.

Jeez. Whatever you gotta tell yourself to insulate your own echo chamber from dissent. My post history and some easy searching would quickly reveal to you my real identity. I think you're just too intellectually lazy to admit that anyone besides yourself is coming from an authentic position. Are you under the impression that there's only one Right answer to a complex unknown? Stop fooling yourself and spreading weak research methods.
Astroturfers manipulate upvote and downvote count here, but I can back my talk up with evidence and tx on the chain. I'm here representing my individual experience with Bitcoin. If you wanna call it fake, then I would suggest you're being anti-social, and I think that's shitty for any community, especially counterculture.

Trickery and manipulation, kind of like your comment which detracts from the real distinction between the Bitcoin forks, designed to mislead people new to Bitcoin. That strategy only works on the front end, and then people educate themselves to the differences and can come to their own conclusion.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:33:53
BTC Bitcoin could be called a scam for similar reasons. In reality, neither BTC or BCH are scams and both are forks.
