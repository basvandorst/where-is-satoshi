I agree, Texas and California by far.  NY seems to be accepting of it, but wants to control it at the same time.

Why not just send the friend money in Bitcoin and let them pay?

Thanks! GBP is next on the list, coming to an update next week. Price alert  notifications is independent from the price badge. The badge just displays the price on the home screen (option of turning this off for people that don't like badges). The notifications option sends a pop-up message when the price reaches a threshold limit.

Thanks 
We worked really hard to make it simple to use but also look nice

Thanks, this is really great!  
1&amp;2 - You should be able to see how much .01 BTC is worth.  If you click on either USD or BTC labels (the light green) it will switch what you are calculating for.  I guess that isn't as straight forward as we were hoping :)
3 - I like the idea, I've had the same problem trying to get exact numbers
4 - The notifications are just local notifications, not push notifications.  So if you fully close out of the app (double tap and swipe it closed) it will not work.  A new update should be out in a week or two that I believe will fix this as we will integrate actual push notifications.
5 - We only currently pull in the /hot section, do you think people would be interested in all parts of /bitcoin?  I didn't want to overwhelm the news sections with every posted article.  I suppose we could allow an option to pull in all reddit or just /hot
6 - This is how it is intended.  We wanted there to be some default news content so that a user didn't unselect everything and end up with no news. (the ones you are seeing are always shown)  I'll be sure to get this fixed in a future release, perhaps with a warning if no news channels are selected.
I'll look into the blockchain.info iframing.
Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated!

This is great

Thanks  I'll looking into order books for a future update.

Thanks, I see what you're saying now.  This looks like a bug, you can specify .1, but .01 results in just 1. Will get this fixed ASAP.

Thanks, would love to know what you like best about the Coindesk app. We've integrated many of the same features, but we have an aggregated news feed across multiple sites (including reddit!) not just one site.

As  mentioned, including support for iOS6 requires more error handling efforts and some new frameworks are only supported on iOS7. Recent reports put the iOS7 user base something like 90% and with the upcoming release of iOS8, supporting 3 OS's would be difficult.  Thanks for the feedback though!
