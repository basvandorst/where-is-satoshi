Are you sure you have the right address?

I would only advocate using breadwallet for small amounts. 
Are you sure it can only be recovered in breadwallet? I haven't found anything to confirm that. It would be strange if the seed recovery was proprietary to breadwallet.

Exactly my concern. If you are trying to BYOB, reliance on Breadwallet would be a huge limitation of which I wasn't aware. 
Also, this has been a TIL experience for me. I guess I thought there were only 2 types of wallets ('normal' and multisig). I'll add that to my long list of things to learn about bitcoin. I guess there are BIP's for each wallet format and different apps support different formats?

Wait, I can only recover my bread wallet with the seed in bread wallet? The seed isn't compatible with other wallets???

You should be able to see your bread wallet balance on any bitcoin Blockchain explorer.

If you like cryptocurrencies, cryptonomicon is excellent.

You can't scale to better profitability, it will only get worse. 
Check our nicehash -&gt; mining altcoins is still profitable with GPUs. $4k in GPU miners will make ~$200/month in profit.

Interesting idea, but wouldn't the independent miners have to maintain 51% in aggregate to insure miner decentralization? That seems expensive

Is bitcoin the libreboot of currencies? Really? 


Never claimed anything similar. I don't think 3% transaction fee on $60 with 6 hours to confirm is a good deal. Maybe my expectations are way off. 
It's not as close to mainstream support as I'd expected.

This particular experience has been unpleasant but I generally enjoy learning. This was definitely a 'test' transaction and I found it a poor experience. 
I understand the free market economic philosophy of the transaction fee, but how does that work practically? How is a non-expert how to know what a good enough fee is? 
(I know it's a standard complaint around here, but I was looking for the transaction fee during the process and never saw it.)

No. They found Win XP didn't delete the private key from memory... sometimes. Otherwise no

I see, sorry for the confusion. 
This was my first BTC purchase. It cost me 3% in fees and took right at 6 hours to confirm. 
I'm still learning about cryptocurrencies, but this experience means BTC is dead to me. 
I'm moving what little BTC I have left to other coins. 
BTC provides me no benefit over fiat banking at this point. It was more expensive and took 6 hours longer. 
I've sorta followed the whole scaling controversy, but don't fully understand it. It certainly seems like a group is effectively undermining BTC - why would I invest in something like that?

And perhaps a valid critique of my expectations. Mainstream adoption is further off than I expected. 
I take steps to protect my privacy and CC transactions. They are mostly instinctive now. This is a new set of rules to learn. Thanks for the chat

I believe WannaCry uses the built in Windows encrypt / decryption abi. But you need the private key to decrypt
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:27:32
That's to hard IMHO. 
I'm technical and don't mind doing that for specific transactions. 
I'm a little bit of a tech advocate in my personal circles. I've been trying to explain bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to my novice friends. This is way too hard for most people. 
My transaction fee was about 2.3% on $60 plus the payment gateway charged me a fee so about 3% or a bit less than $2. 
Is a $60 transaction too small to be economical now days? 
I'm really interested in the distributed scalability problem from a technical standpoint. But I feel like I'm barely at the know what I don't know stage.

I work in IT, (hate how much of its security now) lots of cyber criminals are based out of Russia. The Russian government won't extradite or prosecute any Russian cyber criminals unless there is a Russian victim. 
Some crime related viruses have checks before they execute: if the host has a Russian IPs or Russian alphabet set as default. Especially things like ransomware will stop if certain triggers are met. 
Go back and look at the recent Russian hacker arrests in the news. It's always when the 'leet hacker who can't get caught' goes on an international vacation and gets arrested.

So far
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:21:20
It's all open source so a fork is always possible and not that difficult. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:40:37
I have transactions pending over 5 hours. That is not "just fine". 
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:08:54
I think this would require a hard fork of BTC to a new Proof of Work. It would be interesting to see an ASIC resistant PoW like Ethereum on the existing bitcoin block chain. Ethereum mining is peaking, there could be a huge mining pool of GPU's ready to support such a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:17:25
Seems to me It's actually threat of a hard fork if UASF doesn't work. Seems like UASF is the carrot and hard fork is the stick. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:59:07
That is one of the possible threats from a Hard Fork, yes.
