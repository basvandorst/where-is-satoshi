Please donate some to an animal shelter. I don't know any that accepts Bitcoin though :(

Don't try to spin this around. The fact is that all those "charities" or other groups are pure scam. If they care so much about lgbt rights then why are they not fighting for those rights in i.e. Saudi Arabia? For some reason they only stick to already lgbt tolerant western cultures.

So you think posting he's donations to extreme left wing group and then blocking everyone that disagrees is ok?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:27:17
As much as a smart guy he is, he should stick to what he knows and stay away from politics. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:31:10
100% agree

And you are perfect example of a left wing extremist. You just insulted someone who simply has an opposite opinion. Think about that.

And another example of left wing libtard. You just insulted me simply for having opposite opinion. What's next? Oh let me guess, you will call me bigot and nazi?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:48:55
And this is my opinion and I can disagree if I want.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:26:15
And that is the actual great cause to donate to! Kudos!

You just insulted 50% of the population of USA who voted for him. And you did that only because you hate people who have a different opinion. You just proved my point, thank you.

Not to mention it was his company that bought large amount of bitcoin when it dipped. Scumbag.

You can start from writing Bitcoin correctly
