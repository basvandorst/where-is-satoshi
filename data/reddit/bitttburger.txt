They're perfectly allowed to do this.  But eventually company needs may affect how protocol development proceeds. 
At that point the reason it's a conflict becomes apparent.  No centralized entity is supposed to be having any influence on development.  Isn't that true?

Well how do you like the answers they've given you? You've asked this question in the wrong sub. Folks here seem to have no interest, nor concern about actual end-user adoption anymore.  Raising that concern just gets you the label of FUDster.

Im fully involved on the other sub, and I completely agree with you. There's absolutely nothing amateur about the core developers. They are some of the most talented in the world. That's why they're doing what they're doing. I don't think that has ever been up for debate.

What are you so upset about? It's not like they could use bitcoin. Nobody here gives a flying fuck about actual industries or companies, or regular people using it. Remember? This sub cares about code being good. Nothing else matters. Timelines don't matter. Timelines just equate to "inferior code". Fidelity effect? Opportunity cost? Ain't nobody got time for that shit.  
You should be happy that Walmart is doing this. Then maybe everyone will just leave us alone so we can write some more code for the next eight years and not actually make bitcoin usable by the real world. 
Sarcasm aside, wouldn't it be great if Walmart was using bitcoin? Well guess what. They can't. Because that's not a priority here.  And everyone else on the other sub who thinks it is?  They are just batshit crazies, right? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:00:13
I think it's a complete lack of influence from people representing end-users that properly defines the problem.   Obviously we don't want ridiculous uses of the block chain. But we also don't want coders who have no concern nor interest in the end-user making 100% of the decisions. There should be a middle ground. People who have knowledge of the industry and end-users should have a significant role in the decisions being made. 
I feel like that viewpoint is literally not even represented in this space.
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:11:37
That website has been so insanely analyzed by so many hundreds / thousands of people that all of the concerns you listed have been fully addressed years ago.   The only trust necessary is trust that thousands of people who understand the code (including Andreas) have reviewed it and found it to be void of any concerns.
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:39:36
Right. Years and years and years of avoiding possible problems has resulted in years and years of stagnancy and missed opportunities. 
Someone outside of the code-writing realm should be part of this process.  The complete lack of control allowed from someone who cares about / understands adoption and consumer/industry needs, is the problem here. 
Safe code can be written in less than 8 years.  Coders are usually not the exclusive stewards of timelines in development projects for a reason.  
I wish Bitcoin had involvement from people with other skill sets.  Influential involvement.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:45:48
This article is a year old.  He "forgot" to mention that.  No point in reminding yourself in a year. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:47:47
This is the crux of the entire debate. Opportunity cost. Companies, industries, etc. that have come and gone because we can't support their capacity needs. 
Coders are not trained to care about end-users, or markets. They're trained to code.  That's exactly why programmers don't usually run the show from beginning to end. There are other people hired to come up with specifications to adhere to, so the product actually gets used. 
So it's likely they're not going to do anything in this case either. Which is what boils my blood. There has got to be a logical, rational, middle ground where both perspectives are incorporated.  Maybe Kim has been talking to them though, and lightning network will be fully deployed by then.
@_date: 2016-08-27 07:06:44
Yeah!  Fuck adoption!  As long as coders and server admins can use Bitcoin, that's all this technology will ever need to do!!!  Woohoo were done!   What a relief.  Let Core know.  Close up shop.

You should try delving into their conduct as far as fair competition, map pricing, the intentional hiding of violators identities the accidental disappearance of entire pallets worth of inventory, and the list goes on and on. 
To be completely honest, now that I've actually dug into the reseller side of things, I've never seen a more shady, dishonest, illegal operation in my life. Everyone who is involved in online e-commerce knows this about them. They don't play fair. They're just too big to sue. 
I've gone from loving them as a buyer, to absolutely despising them as an online retailer, because of the shit they pull that no one else would be allowed to get away with. I look forward to the day they get called into court.  It'll happen eventually. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 03:33:27
I don't assume there should be one single block chain. I just hope that the one I'm heavily invested in gets widely used. Crazy concept for many here, I know.  This place has turned into the twilight zone.  
I used to write off the apathy people have here, as just an extreme lack of awareness of how products succeed in a marketplace. That they are just a bunch of programmers who have literally never stepped foot inside of a business class. But I'm not so sure it's that anymore. 
One thing is for sure, quite a few people here have absolutely no clue that bitcoin has missed some of its biggest opportunities.

Or is that something that still needs to be created.  Because we need that if we ever hope to have a financial industry that uses Bitcoin as a backbone.

Not intending to be difficult either, but we will never know.  There has to be a protocol available which allows for extensibility and flexibility in order for thinkers and entrepreneurs to brainstorm the possibilities.  There is no doubt those opportunities have been lost multiple times for Bitcoin because it isn't sufficient.  Whether or not we have specific documentation proving how many, or what.

Quality paranoia and conspiracy theorizing.   Congrats!
I genuinely couldn't figure out what the real deal was.   Because to be quite honest, my personal opinion was that its a massive conflict of interest.  Everyone here rants all fucking day about how centralized power equals corruption.  I thought most of those rants were just zealots, but they basically comprise most of this community.  Liberty.  Hatred of "coercion" etc.  Then Im hearing that the core devs are building a system and bitcoin development is stalling as a result.  I try not to listen to the zealots on either side.  So I asked the question while feeling totally freaked out that such a thing could possibly be happening.  Apparently its pretty much correct, and apparently people think centralized for-profit efforts having influence over the protocol plans is considered a good thing.  Now im just doubly confused.  But no concern trolling.

Coders need to include the rest of the industry in the control of the project. 
The thinkers, entrepreneurs, artists, creative minds, and business types need to be included in the planning, and growth, and direction of the protocol. 
Obviously within reason, and keeping to the intended goals of the founder. 
But the complete absence of this entire segment of the community is the reason why nobody's using Bitcoin today.

Head in the sand or just plain denial?   I will never understand this mentality.  Is it that you don't understand how products succeed in a marketplace? That you actually think all of this is irrelevant news? I just don't get it. 
I know that a lot of people in this particular sub tend to be programmers. And a lot of people in the other one tend to work in the business world in other capacities (management, marketing, entrepreneurs, business owners, etc).  I dare say those people would have a better understanding of what's going on, and the ramifications, than coders would.
It's not about stupid, silly, paranoia, sky-falling nonsense. I don't understand why you and so many others think it's that stupid, and simple.

Also, why there can't be more developers helping speed things up. I feel like there are 5 or 6 people controlling the pipeline, and if they can't do it themselves, it doesn't get done.  
When there's a bottleneck slowing things this much, shouldn't more heads be in the game?

The homeless that are mentally stable need to be pushed towards employment.  Not given everything (food / shelter), enabling them to remain unproductive with no incentive to change.   I'd be out on the street too, if I was coddled in such a manner and didn't mind living in filth.  
The homeless that have alcohol or drug addictions need to be put into facilities funded by State and local government which will give them the opportunity to clean up.  Maybe a three strikes rule.  I don't know the solution for those who fail to clean up.  
The homeless that struggle with mental disabilities need to be put into institutions that will care for them, funded by state and local government.  They should not be out on the street in the first place.
None of these three scenarios makes room for just blindly taking care of homeless people en masse.  Tent cities and other scenarios that just enable, facilitate, and do nothing to help change the situation. 
I realize this is a astoundingly unpopular opinion, and I expect to be down voted to hell. But I live in a city that is overrun with homeless people, San Diego. They run around downtown streets screaming and doing all kinds of crazy shit in their dirty underwear, wrapped in towels naked,  tweaking out on drugs, harassing people, leaving needles and broken liquor bottles everywhere.  I'm tired of it. I don't agree with blindly supporting them by handing food to them, and giving them places to sleep. Situations like this need to change. Not be "enabled".  
The communities that are "challenging" Seans outpost, no doubt feel the same way that I do. Yet they're made to sound like total assholes that care nothing for their fellow human being. On the contrary, quite a few people think that homelessness shouldn't be enabled. That the real focus should be on rehabilitation and improving their situation long term.  There's a difference between helping and enabling people. 
Sorry if I've offended anyone.

*"The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size."*
*- Satoshi Nakamoto*
I really think Bitcoin isn't for you.  You actually think it wasn't intended to match and surpass VISA transaction volumes **on chain**.   You should leave the ecosystem.  Please, just divest and go.


I believe this statement to be false.  I have no recollection of calling anyone an idiot because they felt that Bitcoin didn't bring anything unique to the table as a payment system.  In context, I am sure I could explain my thinking, if you have an example to point to.  But I actually have been the guy who has said (ad nauseum) that consumers in the 1st world have absolutely zero incentive to use Bitcoin.  And that this is our biggest hurdle.   I always get down voted for saying it. 
This is why I have called for (for over 3 years) someone to hurry the fuck up and get **[Extensibility]( rolling on the layer above the protocol.  I remember over 2 years ago hearing the announcement for side chains.  Two years and still no side chains.  Bitcoin itself is a basic system.  The finance industry needs more speed, size, and flexible functionality.  That's why they've walked away.  
I am in support of on chain scaling and wholeheartedly in support of side chains, lightning network (and similar) which extend bitcoins feature-set.  But where is all this?  We think we've got all the time in the world.  Before Gavin ever said a word about this, and before there was any ecosystem-wide divide on this topic, I was one of only a couple people screaming that we need to hurry up and get all this moving.  For three years I've been told to just chill out and kick my feet up and relax.  Now the entire finance industry has moved on, and I am still hearing the same weird apathy.
Maybe I am misunderstanding what you remember me saying.  But this is where I stand today on the topic.

Front page helped me create the first iteration of a website I built in 1998.  While I was sitting in my cubicle at work, bored.  That website grew to make me quite a bit of money.  
A few years later, I needed to do a redesign / expansion, so I transitioned to Dreamweaver, and redid the entire site that way.  
With both these platforms I grew the site, got first page ranking out of 64 million search results, and ultimately generated nearly $1 million in sales per year.

I fear that the time sacrificed will result in the very quick-moving industry opting for other solutions.  I already feel like we've missed countless opportunities for coopt-ion and adoption in the business world.  I am concerned that this hyper-focus on the code and complete disinterest in the ecosystem will turn out to be Bitcoins downfall.  And I'm not trying to be "sky-is-falling" right now.

Without trust, our entire society right now wouldn't exist, functioning in any successful capacity whatsoever. 
I'm with you. I believe in trustless decentralization. But we have to acknowledge the fact that the world literally runs on trust. In 1000 different ways, for billions of different people. Businesses and personal interactions both. 
And where trust might fail, you have regulations. The fear of breaking the law and getting in trouble, forces people to act trustworthy. Contracts. Agreements. Signatures.  And laws. This is the current system.  
While a decentralized trustless utopia would probably be better, we have to keep our viewpoints rational.  We can't just deny that the current system works the vast majority of the time.   And it's functioning enough that there are thriving billions of humans, cities and companies on the planet.

Just curious, what would have to happen in the industry for you to actually start feeling like maybe bitcoin is losing market share and future adoption?  
Since everyone in the finance industry has literally decided to pass on it and do something else, funding new companies has all but dried up, and companies that were doing exclusively bitcoin are no longer doing so, what exactly would it take for you to actually feel some concern?  
The blanket poo-poo'ing of these concerns strikes me as a lack of education on how products succeed (and fail) in a marketplace. But maybe I'm wrong.

Let me save you both some time on the podcast that you're considering doing.  is going to spend the entire time trying to make you realize that what you're calling a block chain, isn't a block chain. He wants you to use a different term for it. 
And he's going to spend the time telling you that what you're making is pointless and completely futile. 
In turn, you're going to spend the entire time saying that a block chain can be many different things, and doesn't necessarily have to be identical to Satoshi's version.  
Also that what you guys are building is a significant improvement over the current banking system, and will save hundreds of millions of dollars. 
In this case, you are both going to be correct on the former points. And only you will be right on the latter points. But you guys will still likely go round and round in circles on this until you both realize that you just have different definitions of block chains. 
But let's do the podcast anyways, because it's always entertaining to listen to these guys.

And so once again we've got a great system that people may never use.  This is a common problem in this scene because programmers are entirely in charge of specifications.  
I know I'll get down voted to utter hell for this but how many examples do we need before we see that this keeps happening?  
Tech people and lay people are from different universes. This is why in the real world where successful products are brought to market, there are product experts and market and demographic and design experts who decide what the tech folks build.  
But not us.  We keep making stuff that's is so cool and so unbelievably of zero interest to the general public, that barely anyone uses it.

Well they're pissed because they're concerned that development strides all seem to center around building an infrastructure for a for-profit company.  In a sense isn't that a rational concern?  Obviously nobody can comment on someone else's intent.  
But given bitcoin's focus on decentralization and keeping developers from conflict of interest.... It really seems like a rational concern.  
Usually when a debate rages on this long, it's not because one party is being absurd.  It's because both parties have valid viewpoints and the solution is truly difficult to find. 
I think you're right about one thing for sure: when the argument branches off from facts, to: "I know what that guy is really thinking and why he's *really* doing what he's doing", then the debate becomes muddied. And that has happened. But at the same time, those people would fairly say: "If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck." 
As for me? I just want things to keep moving forward. I want Bitcoin to stay competitive. Because it's no longer the only crypto, and it's network effect needs to stop being relied upon. 
I think that the landscape will continue to evolve over the years. Lightning network and block stream may be superseded by hundred other solutions. But I think Bitcoin needs to stay ahead of the curve (features/functionality/capacity), every step of the way.  It's too easy for someone else to make something new, and better.  And apparently all they would need is five Chinese warehouses to surpass it's hashing power. 
We really really need to stop relying on our first mover advantage.

I guess maybe the point is, what they're making very well save them millions, be very useful, and be a drastic improvement over their current systems.  Even if we think it's stupid.  
I see a lot of people talking shit about it but sometime in the next 1 to 3 years, a lot of it is going live, and I think a lot of people here are gonna be suddenly dead silent when they see that it's actually working for them and growing in popularity.

You know it's not that simple. Some people are genuinely concerned that a centralized service is taking transactions off chain. And therefore SW is just preparatory infrastructure for that.
Others have absolutely voiced that they're fine with SW. I read it every day over there. I personally think that's the majority opinion there. They just don't want transactions coming off chain as well. It's a complicated, multifaceted debate.

Snark game in full effect, but have an upvote.  The sentiment is accurate.  I am losing hope that bitcoin will be the technology that gets co-opted to take over the world. Unless something big happens soon. 
This is the big debate going on with everyone in Bitcoin right now. If you just put on blinders and focus on the code, and the current usage numbers, there's absolutely nothing to worry about. *"Bitcoin is fine"*. 
But those who look at the industry, the dropoff in interest levels, the cessation of funding, the disbanding of Bitcoin companies, and the corporate switches "from Bitcoin to block chain" … they express some serious concerns about bitcoins future. 
This is why people are so focused on things like block size, enhancements, speed of development, and where the fuck are sidechains, etc. It's not just a bunch of idiots trying to spread FUD.  The industry looks at what bitcoin can do today.  Right now.  Not in 2017.  If it finds it lacking, they will go somewhere else.  We need to be looking at more than current usage numbers.

It's opportunity cost.  Something I've seen folks here reject as a "thing", religiously.  
The lost opportunities of having a system that is too slow, too limited, and too thin on flexibility or features. So businesses in the finance world take one look, find it lacking, and don't even bother trying Bitcoin's block chain as a solution to their needs. They just walk away.  
Opportunity cost. 
Meanwhile the short-sighted here think "all is well" because Sally had no problem paying for a cappuccino today.  Because in their minds, today is all that matters.  Those massive companies that wanted to use Bitcoin (Fidelity, Patrick Byrnes Stock system, NASDAQ, etc) don't exist.  Don't matter.  And don't qualify as "demand". 
Short sighted. 
Therefore to answer your question:  Bitcoin has been a fail to companies which were too large for it and therefore couldn't use it.

Fair enough.  I participate there I guess because I share some views with the non-coder types who gather there.  There seems to be a larger gathering of people who've got knowledge about business, marketing, project management, sales, etc on that sub. And here primarily there seems to be programmers, cryptographers, coders. Just an observation. 
I was a project manager for 10 years before starting my own website.  So I've been managing development projects from the perspective not just of the programmers, but marketing, project management, sales, and all those other things that you can't just ignore if you want something to succeed. 
So I share a lot of their concerns about keeping BTC competitive and moving forward more briskly (without compromising the quality of the code).  There are weirdos over there, but a lot of people are in non-tech roles, have seen products fail in the marketplace, and are just concerned were skating on thin ice.  
@_date: 2016-04-04 04:24:02
$1 mill per year.  Not per day.  Not too impressive for a small business that had been around 8 years at that point. 
And I absolutely think projects need project managers.  Anyone who doesn't, hasn't gone through the product development process and seen the disaster that ensues - even with one.  
I don't need to be the project manager.  Not sure where that came from.  
Oh, you were just being a dick.

Well its not really up for debate technically - they are comparing private ledgers to their *current* system.    That's why it really makes no sense to downvote such a comment.  A lot of people in this community are mocking them for doing something inefficient, illogical, etc.   But there are a thousand ways to accomplish the goal of saving time and money.  Just because this sub is a gathering of programmers and cryptographers with strong opinions (and probably much better ideas), doesnt mean what they're doing is "completely useless" and "they're all idiots".
Their current system is so outdated, so inefficient, and so archaic, that what they are doing *will* save them.  Probably hundreds of millions of dollars.  And it *will* improve speeds.  And it *WILL* remove trusted entities, and simplify the money-moving process.  So in that sense, private block chains are going to be hailed an absolute, unequivocal success.
The problem is that people here, just like everywhere on earth for some reason, can't see past their own opinions.  If you've got a programmer here who "knows" there's a "much better way of doing it" ... or he feels "theyre just building a glorified database and so this is stupid" ... thats really completely fucking irrelevant.  He may be 100% right.  But as I said - there are a thousand ways to accomplish things sometimes.  A whole spectrum of cumbersome and inefficient to gloriously simple and very efficient.  
The metric they're determining success and usefulness is based on whether its an improvement.  And it will be.  Because what they've been doing is *that bad*.  
So I don't even need to speak in specifics.  This, like many things, seems to me the age-old problem of human beings with biases, being literally unable to acknowledge things, because it doesn't suit their opinions or worldviews.  And I end up seeing highly intelligent people saying utterly stupid things as a result.  
I don't want banks to succeed.  But Im hardly going to make the absurd claim that everyone at Microsoft is an idiot for looking into Ethereum, or that literally everyone (hundreds of bright, innovative thinkers) across multinational banks are just a group of retards who don't realize they're creating something "completely useless" (words people here use).  
I just want rational thought.  Rational comments.  And suck it up if its something you don't like to admit.  We missed the Fidelity boat because we couldn't support their volume needs.  So they're building their own.  We should allow that frustration to speed up development times, and start admitting that the industry is actually moving forward without us.  But that's a different topic.
We think we have the best solution.  Bitcoin.  But again we need to drop our biases and start thinking rationally.  No bank is going to go anywhere near the anarchy-based, dark web, terrorism reputation "Bitcoin".  So they're going to make their own.  Maybe try to coopt Ethereum.  
And maybe in 10 years, when Bitcoins silly reputation has faded, and there is an entire industry sitting atop the biggest, most secure block chain on earth (Bitcoin), .... and there are longstanding corporations with financial services which operate using it - maybe then banks will coopt Bitcoin (*through those companies*), because those trusted centralized "2nd layer" services will have great reputations, and the security of the bitcoin block chain to secure things.

Disagree totally.  I participate over there frequently and I'm elated to see this release.  Most people over there just want forward progress.  This whole thing started because literally nothing was getting done to enhance Bitcoin as it pertains to market needs.  In the end, people want this technology (and yes, their investment) to succeed.  
Some (that sub) feel strongly that forward progress and staying competitive in the market are necessary for that success. They see Bitcoin falling behind.  Others (this sub) express that all is well and nothing needs to be done aside from a couple turns of a screw and maybe a shiny new bolt.  These people seem to focus only on stable code and have little interest in whether the product succeeds in the marketplace or any real-life scenario. 
Neither party is stupid or FUDding in my opinion. Especially not the former.  As for the latter, I just think it's the typical viewpoint of a tech person. They don't usually bother themselves with market analysis, end users, or industry competition issues.  It's all about "stable code". 
Obviously I have generalized here for both parties. It's a lot deeper than that. But I don't think it's fair to just call the other sub a bunch of paranoid buttcoiners.

@_date: 2015-12-04 03:59:51
Sorry, I guess I'm doing a terrible job at explaining what I'm trying to say. Because everybody responds with something that I consider to be inapplicable.
Basically bitcoin can either be a peer-to-peer payment system forever, or it can be what we've been hyped up to believe it could be. A replacement for the current financial industry. 
The financial industry has all kinds of products and services. Escrow. Accounting. Mortgage. Stocks. Banking. Investments. You name it.
These are mature industries. They are mature products and services. They've got sometimes millions of customers. They've got feature sets that are extremely varied and unique. They need to do a lot of different "things".
Really in my opinion the biggest problem facing bitcoin right now is this question: is bitcoin going to be a peer-to-peer payment system or is it going to replace the finance industry? So what's the next step? You ask if it's even capable of doing all the things these mature services need it to do. And it can't. So the next step is asking: what about on the layer above? Side chains. Well there's nobody building anything. 
Bitcoin is suitable as a peer-to-peer payment system. But it's being looked at by mature players in the finance industry and being found lacking. Not just as far as speed. But also features. Functionality. Flexibility. The things they need to do, to carry out their business. 
Supposedly there could be an entire industry of financial products and services on the layer above bitcoin. But nobody's doing jack shit. We've got coinbase. And Bitpay.  Etc.  Lightning.  MasterCoin was supposed to do this.  It was a flop.  Counterparty isn't doing anything interesting as far as I can see.  BitWage is the closest thing I can think of to what I'm referring to. A payroll service. On the Blockchain. Why aren't there 1000 more of these start ups right now? It's been seven years.
The bottom line is this: if we have any hopes for Bitcoin to stay relevant in the finance industry as more than a peer-to-peer payment system, shit better start moving quickly. Otherwise it's going to get passed up. And it's going to remain nothing more than a peer-to-peer payment system. 
I'm not trying to make Bitcoin something that it's not. But people need to stop talking about it taking over banks, and replacing the evil corrupt finance system. Because that's a bunch of bullshit. It can't do that. Physically it wasn't made to do that. And I would have some hope that it could take over finance if somebody was actually doing… Anything… On the layer above. But nobody is. So it's not going to take over finance at this rate. So we need to stop saying that altogether. It's setting expectations that will never be met.
That's my point. That's why I keep complaining and kicking and screaming here. Everybody says "chill out, we've got plenty of time". Well if we wanted to replace the financial system, we don't have plenty of time. We've got a product that can't hang, and few are innovating to make it capable of more things.

Which was then given to her only son upon her death to ensure his financial security.  Which the Government then took half of, because I withdrew it before I turned 65.

I'm estimating a month prior it will be at its highest price.  Might even drop after the halving because it will go so high from excessive speculating.  
Then people will dump.  After the dumps it should reach a new equilibrium a few months out from the halving and settle on a new, higher average price.  But it is not already priced in.

He's saying that updating data needs to be easier and more user friendly.  He says it seems that you guys are getting info from each other, which means he needs to go to every site and update it, or else the change may get overwritten. 
This tells me there needs to be a central steward of ATM locations where they can all go to one location to update their info.  For all the sites.  But that would require cooperation between (potentially competing?) ATM locator sites.

You are aware that the more privacy is compromised, the further it will just keep going, right? Our entire lives are available to third parties at this point. I don't know how old you are. But at age 41, I grew up having complete privacy over everything I did. Now, everything I do is retrievable by some third party if necessary. 
So reading your post, I wonder if you're aware that this is a desensitization process. It happens over decades, but it continually grows. It doesn't shrink. It always grows. There's always more invasiveness. Inching its way in. I'm  the last guy to be a conspiracy theorist. But you have to be a little retarded not to see how this happens.

Don't get me wrong. I get where Amir is coming from. I think he saying that a lot of people here just want to get rich so badly that they're willing to begin compromising their standards if it means their coins will be worth a lot one day. 
But I don't think widespread adoption needs to be equivalent to selling out like total whores. In fact I think there's a couple billion very poor people who would benefit from widespread adoption in some capacity. It can be done carefully, while staying true to certain important ideals. 
But I also don't necessarily see anything wrong with Bitcoin having multiple personalities. Maybe in the developed world it *will* be a banking thing.  And maybe in Africa it will empower billions of people. Do we just give that up because of the banking element? Of course not. 
Was it Marc Andressen who said that Bitcoiners will eventually hate Bitcoin, because of what it will become? I believe that is going to prove to be one of the most prophetic statements in this space.

So what it comes down to is - The only thing bitcoin really has to offer is that it's got the largest network. And therefore the best security. As a protocol it can't really do anything special, and it's going to have to have all these additional layers just in order to do some things that qualify as useful. And - anyone can make an alternative protocol that will do everything they need it to do. That's a recipe for disaster as far as "staying relevant" in the next 10 years.

Not trying to be "that guy" but talking about "block chain" is a hell of a lot more "alt-coin"ish than talking about alternate clients on the Bitcoin block chain, isn't it?

The question is: was bitcoin intended to be a new financial/banking system in the first place? Or was it intended to be peer-to-peer cash.  
If the former, then you can probably just forget about that. If the latter, then we're already there.

We will come back down from the high because just like with Gox, the high won't be due to actual organic supply and demand.  It will be due to temporary investors reading articles like this one, and hopping on board temporarily.
Basically what I'm envisioning is:  $400 today.  $800, $900, $1200+ during the speculative frenzy.  
Then the halving.  
Then the dump back down.  
Then the new Bitcoin price, post-halving at what... maybe $850 or so?   It's anyone's guess the actual numbers.  I agree we will ultimately end up higher after the halving.  But I do feel there will be a speculative bubble that will pop.

Most likely they just view the core code to be so holy that the idea of just hiring new developers to "help speed things up" is just not even part of their mentality. They don't know who the person is. So maybe that person won't share their ideological viewpoint. And speeding things up isn't even in their vocabulary. It's slow and steady.

I could be wrong but I think the *last* thing banks are going to do is offer a coin for public purchase.  They're using block chain protocol the way it was intended:  as a back end system to facilitate transactions.  A ledger.   The whole concept of Dogecoin and Kanyecoin etc was a bunch of neckbeards trying to get wealthy by IPO'ing random coins with various gimmicks.  In fact the very opposite of what banks are doing, as they had no actual utility in the real world.

**This is the exact question that is on the table for Bitcoin today**.  Is Bitcoin supposed a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, or is it supposed to transform the world of finance, eliminate / reduce fraud, and cut out middlemen across numerous industries?
So what is Bitcoin supposed to be, in your opinion (everyone) ?  
It was intended by Satoshi as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  Although he clearly referenced bank bailouts on the genesis block. It has been touted since, as having potential to oust banks, and transform finance.  I could be wrong but the core devs are dedicated to the former, and it is on the layer above where the latter is supposed to come about.  
Assuming the protocol can support such functionality on the layer above...

Everybody that talks shit about bank chains does so with nothing substantial.  And my conscience just raises alarms every time I hear them speak. Because every single comment they make about why bank chains are going to fail, is based on an assumption that doesn't make sense. 
Like every single person being paid billions of dollars to build these systems is a fucking idiot. Or… All of these people have no clue that what they're building it makes no sense.  Or...

Well yes if we're just going to wait until the whole thing falls apart and breaks down. Obviously by that time they will be "forced" to do something. My problem is that while we're fucking around doing nothing, the industry is moving on from Bitcoin, to other protocols. Because we can't support their needs. 
So yes you're right, if the whole thing falls apart because it can't move forward anymore, they will increase the block size. But hey by that time lightning network should be ready (quelle coïncidence!), and everyone else in the industry will have said goodbye to the Bitcoin protocol long ago.

It's extremely odd to me that he would accurately predict the centralization of mining, but fail to comment on consensus in that setting.
Are there any quotes from him that flesh out the above quote? Because on the one hand he says how great it is that individuals can mine on their PCs. Consensus in that setting is basically you me and everyone here having a say in where bitcoin goes. 
But on the other hand he admits that single individuals will be in charge of entire server farms. Yet he fails to comment on what consensus looks like in that setting.
They're so incredibly different that I can't believe he didn't clarify.  Or did he?  
Either way the original point was interesting:  this attitude that the people who participate here should have no say, and their opinion should even be banned/censored... because "a handful of developers chit-chatting with some warehouse owners" is the only currently acceptable form of consensus... is short sighted.  Incomplete. And false.  If things had panned-out a little differently, we would be the source of consensus.  Not Peter Todd at a podium talking to a Chinese warehouse owner on a stage.

Find a service in the financial industry. Duplicate it with bitcoin, removing trusted third parties, and speeding up the processes.   Taking advantage of all the perks that bitcoin offers. And build that service on the layer above, latching into the bitcoin protocol. 
Then own it. Grow it.  Sell it.  Get investments for it.  Funding. An example of a financial service (payroll processing) that's been improved-upon with Bitcoin is BitWage. 
We need products and services on the layers above desperately. It's a brand-new industry with nobody claiming any stakes there yet. Be one of the first.  Do it well, and you will probably get rich.

I can't agree.  I've run forums with tens of thousands of users for over 16 years. Any time I tried to censor discussion on a topic that a relevant percent of my users wanted to discuss, I ended up the loser in the battle.  In the end, discussing *all* elements that relate to Bitcoin should be allowed. 


This policy is a dangerous one to have in an open online community.  But it also reflects a sentiment among the Bitcoin elite that few may realize:  The opinion of the masses is irrelevant.  Blocking discussion of something *before* it has overwhelming consensus is the giveaway. 
Translation: Consensus never comes from the community raising concerns and calling for change.  Consensus will be discussed and decided among the dev team and miners only.  Once consensus is attained by the men behind the curtain, *then* you will be allowed to discuss it.  
In my opinion this is a dangerous mentality that leads to all forms of leadership corruption. Keep the masses ignorant and silent.  Let the elite few think for them.  And I hardly think Satoshi felt this way.  He seemed wide open to change, and input from others.

This is a finance conference. I just feel like we need to put our best foot forward, when weve got incredibly intelligent people on the panel. The industry is watching. And it's kind of embarrassing to have quirky/unprofessional/way too casual people running panels like this.  I appreciate eccentric people more than the average person. But the finance industry doesn't want to see that. It looks amateur and embarrassing.

God knows why it's still too early after 3 years of arguing about it.  Lightning network isn't ready yet?  Damn.  Why's it keep coming back to LN?  
Oh that's right. Because there's no other fucking reason why they are still arguing about it and making no progress after three years. So why do you think people are having conspiracy theories about LN...

I hear a lot of people making a lot of smart comments here, but I often wonder if any of this information is acknowledged or understood by these institutions.

And to take it a step further… you've also got factors like "most people don't care about decentralization" and other similar premise-destroying concepts.

PayPal barely takes a day or two to get my money to me. I get ACH transfers from product sales on my store. And they take literally 24 hours maximum. From a completely unrelated bank and service, to my bank. 
So can you clarify why coinbase needs to take an entire week if you include weekend days? We call it 5 days. But it's always 7 full days. This is not the fault of the banking system. This is a decision coinbase made. And therefore this complaint is a legitimate one.
As a sidenote, I agree with you on Coinbase. We desperately need them. In fact it's become very frustrating for me that this is the only infrastructure we've got after seven years. Where are all the financial products and services being built on top of Bitcoin? It's just not happening.

1)  Financial identify theft.  (No more risk of stolen credit cards)
2)  And… I think pretty much everyone I know thinks their bank treats them poorly.  In some capacity.  Whether it's lack of freedom to do what they want with their own money. Inability to open up multiple accounts. Having accounts closed randomly because they transfer funds around too often, or don't hold a large enough balance. Dealing with stupid rules and restrictions. Or the massive problem of absurd fees, everywhere. Being closed on weekends and holidays.  The archaic concept of batch processing, waiting for midnight to have their paycheck funds available.  Standing in lines. I mean the list goes on and on. Bitcoin addresses every single one of these things and 50 more.
3)  All the contractors that work for me. Programmers, designers, freelancers. They have to pay absurd fees through websites like ELance, or PayPal. I can now pay them with zero fees taken out. I've yet to meet one that doesn't jump on that in a heartbeat.  They also absolutely love seeing the funds in their wallet instantly rather than having to wait a few days before they can withdraw to their bank account.  Literally every single contract I've worked with who I've recommended this to has become a bitcoin adoptee within 15 minutes.

Also by the way, do you actually think programmers have any training whatsoever in product development? I'm not saying that they should have no input.

I've seen people complaining about block size limit. Can you show me where everyone's complaining that bitcoin can't handle the feature set required as well? We're talking alt coin functionality here. Extensibility. I'm not talking about transaction volume or block size. I'm talking about even if we fix the block size limit, there's no infrastructure in bitcoin that can support the functionality and features they need as well. Maybe I'm not being clear enough in what I mean by features and functionality. But I'm referring to an industry product or service in finance that is already mature, already has millions of customers, and needs to do 1000 different things in order to duplicate their business model in bitcoin. Bitcoin can't do that. So even if we fix the block size limit, this issue remains.  This is the 10,000 pound elephant.

I told him that Magento and Woo and OSCommerce and Shopify should just have plugins / extensions where a merchant can use his own Bitcoin wallet. No third party service needed.  But that it would need to calculate in real-time the rate etc. He said he was already working on that and he listed for me to bunch of other really cool features.

Here's a newsflash for you. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand the situation. So this statement I keep hearing that these developers are holders of a vast intelligence quotient we could only dream of, is silly. 
You sound like my doctor. He thinks everyone's an idiot also. But he doesn't realize that you can know all you need to know about a common cold in about 15 minutes of googling.

And you've got Satoshi apparently saying (7 years ago) it's just peer-to-peer cash. Nothing more.
So who's right? Or more importantly, who's got control over what it becomes?

And to all the people on this sub who said the halving is already priced in:   This is the beginning of the media coverage that I was referring to which will ultimately reach fever pitch a few months out, boosting the price prior to the halving as new people hop on board to make a quick buck.  
That's when the halving will get priced in.  Will you be able to call the top before it crashes back down?
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:07:08
Thanks. That was actually a really interesting response. So I have a question for you as a follow up: wouldn't it be better if this "dumb protocol" was built in a way that was similar to the iPhone iOS? A dumb base protocol that is capable of thousands of "apps" running atop it?  Allowing for innovation in hundreds of different forms?  Financial apps. 
If that's what the bitcoin protocol was, I would have absolutely no concerns right now. But my understanding is that it's not even built to facilitate products and services on the layer above. In fact it was built as a dumb protocol that does only one thing. Peer-to-peer transactions. 
So isn't the question really this: was bitcoin intended to have a multitude of financial apps built on top of it, or was bitcoin intended to be a simple peer-to-peer payment system? It seems to me the latter. Not the former.  This I believe is the biggest issue on the table, and nobody wants to talk about it except me.

I raised this idea to the bitcoin core developers to help them speed up the process, and received 20 down votes in response. So I don't want to just assume that more heads in the game is a desirable thing.  It would be to any typical development project, but...

If bitcoin itself doesn't make itself capable of competing with private blocked chains as far as features and extensibility, that's when bitcoin becomes irrelevant. Forget Trojan horses. The protocol can't even support what the industry needs it to do. And I'm not just talking about speed or block size. This is the 10,000 pound elephant in the room that nobody's talking about for some reason.

Clearly I'm no expert but I think it's painfully obvious that you can't just go blowing up the feature set on layer 1. My biggest concern was that layer 1 is not equipped to facilitate layer 2 sufficiently. LukeJr said its not. I assume side chains are how we get there.
Now tell me this: is there an entire army of innovators and entrepreneurs just frothing at the mouth waiting for sidechains to be released? Ready to build an entire infrastructure atop bitcoin? Or is it just going to sit there with a couple projects for the next three years, while other block chains get developed-out by multi billion dollar corporations?

The holders would also probably be miners in Satoshis vision. Because mining was supposed to be decentralized enough to do on your PC. 
So the holders would be the ones casting the votes. But I've explicitly heard Dev team members here saying that we should not be casting votes. This is not a democracy. Etc. None of that made any sense to me. Until I realized they're  wrong. We *are* supposed to be casting a vote. But the mining system is now so disfigured that we no longer can cast a significant vote.

As usual, what I wrote was misunderstood. We need coinbase in the sense that it's our only infrastructure to the outside world. Just like the original post in this thread described. That was the context of my comment. 
In that sense, bitcoin needs coinbase because it's the only conduit to the general public right now. There really isn't anything else going on in the space. So the fact that you managed to live on bitcoin without Coinbase is irrelevant. That's not what I was talking about.

It's going to crash because there's going to be short term investors. People who want to get in on the hype. There's going to be hype like you've never seen before. 
The actual price increase that the halving is going to bring, may appear a few months after the halving. After the artificial spike. After things settle down and the dust clears, you'll have the new "constant" higher bitcoin price thanks to the reduced supply. 
But in the months leading up to it and during, you're going to see a bunch of typical human behavior. Speculators. Pumpers. Newcomers trying to make a quick buck. All of that is going to push the price sky high before it crashes. I don't think I could be any more confident about this than I am.

Why does everyone have to assume some evil conspiracy with everything?  Isn't it possible that he simply got so informed on the topic over the last two years that he's now somewhat of an expert on it, and can use that to consult companies just like Andreas does?  If you were an expert in the biggest new technology in the world, wouldn't you use that to start a business around it? I sure would.
This mentality that everyone in regulatory positions is an inherently evil piece of shit that's out to harm everyone, is fucking nonsense. I can't imagine going around living life like that. There are good people in positions of power. Believe it or don't. 
If you've ever been in a position of power you know the kind of abuse people give you just because of your position. It sucks. Nothing you say or do will convince them that your intentions are good. I've been there. So I guess I have a unique perspective on this.

That's million-dollar question my friend. And here's the $10 million question: if you did want to build something, would the protocol even be able to support it right now?
See when you build businesses on the layer above the protocol, they need features and functionalities. They need flexibility. Extensibility. 
I keep going back to the iPhone App Store as my example. If you build something that's foundational like the app system on the iPhone, you can build anything you want on the layer above it.  Who could imagine that a cell phone could translate a sign on the side of the street from Spanish to English, simply by pointing at it? Or allowing me to control my thermostat from another country?  
But as far as I know that isn't the case with bitcoin. The protocol may or may not be flexible enough for you to do much. You'll have to do the research on that.  Only then can a list of use-cases be written down for you to play with and possibly build.  
I hear a lot of talk about escrow and proof of existence using Bitcoin.  Remittances were supposed to be the big thing, but it turned out that cashing out requires brick-and-mortar off ramps that simply don't exist yet. 
You ask what the world is screaming for. I don't even know where to begin to answer that question. I feel like it's an entire industry waiting to be built. And there's only two or three services currently built. You're going to have to do the research. 
I wish I had your skillset because I would kill it right now. I would be doing so many things. Starting so many businesses. Getting so creative with my brainstorming.  Fortunately all I can do is give you my enthusiasm, and encouragement to do the research. 
Find a need that isn't being met, and meet it. 
That's how you get rich.

@_date: 2015-06-18 16:27:03
Look I don't understand if we want true decentralized decisions, why there isnt a voting mechanism for the community? Why do I keep getting shot down with this idea? If you don't want a few core developers making all the decisions, then let the industry make the decisions. We've got a voting system that is not corruptible. Why don't we use it?  Oh that's right, because "this isn't a democracy"?
Well maybe it should be. If you want "nobody to be in control" except the diffuse decentralized community, then the community needs to be the ones making the decisions via voting. Otherwise you got a few people making the decisions. By definition.

Your assertion that one needs to be an expert on something in order to understand it, is false. It sounds good though right? Sounds almost bulletproof when you say something completely vague like that. 
But when you get into the details, you realize that experts are necessary for certain things, and not necessary for other things. Can I build a rocket that goes to the moon? No. Can I know that doxycycline is best for Lyme disease, without having an M.D. by my name? Yes. 
Can literally hundreds of people here understand the block size situation fully, without being a "Core Dev"? Yes.
Do developers typically have enough knowledge on product development, marketing, or demographics to be making product development decisions in a vacuum by themselves? Absofuckinglutely not.
Yet here they are, playing CEO, CIO, COO, marketing lead, product development, project manager, even designer. That's not how products get built in the real world. At least not those that actually end up succeeding.  And I'm not the least bit surprised that they've been absolutely ineffective at playing those rolls. That's the point. Stop ignoring the community. The entrepreneurs. The business owners. The people this product is being made for.
This is an ideology disagreement. It's not a knowledge thing. It's not argument between people who know what's going on and those who don't.  It's an argument between two parties who know what's going on, and have different opinions on what bitcoin should become.

Intuitiveness is hard to explain. I just arrive in the admin area sometimes, and I'm not sure what to click, to find what I'm looking for. That's the sensation I get it. It happened a year ago. And again recently. I think this time I was looking for a recent transaction. I knew a guy had paid me in the 0.63 BTC. So I clicked on account activity, and it simply wasn't there. I knew I was looking at my account ledger. I knew I was looking at my transactions. But there were simply no transactions there.  I must've sat there for 15 minutes, and I'm no dummy. But I couldn't find the transaction anywhere. So I open a support ticket asking where it was. Your support pointed out that it got lumped in the "USD" account area rather than "BTC" account activity. I guess because I convert immediately to USD. 
This is one fairly bad example. But I've definitely felt like I'm not sure where to go to find things when I after I log into the admin. And/or things I click on, don't show me what I thought they would. Sometimes.

Everybody has different margins and different products. As I've stated elsewhere in this thread, the majority of my products have a 30 to 40% margin. When some of my transactions are getting 12% fees, and my average is 6%, I can afford to run a 10% discount for a while. I never said anything about it being permanent. And I can always lower it to 6% to break even. Or lower it to 3%, like I referenced in the original post, long-term.

The IRS is who the answers you gave will go to. It was given to me on solid authority that coinbase has already made all their customer information available to the IRS. I'm no longer using them. I'm getting tired of being asked for my Social Security number and other personally identifiable information. I understand they have to do this, but there's no reason for me to participate any longer. As you can see from the tax reporting option they have on their website, all the data they seem to have retained goes back to January 2013.

Okay but is that necessary for Blockchain technology? If IBM is going to make their own, they will have no structure of mining nor financial incentive.

Understand that this protocol has been sitting here in this condition for nearly 2 years now.  In that time, every single possible domain name has been taken by someone who now requires ransom money (usually 5-10x the normal fee) to release the name to you. 
THEY have automated software.  It automatically finds any previously-registered domain name and takes it the second it goes back on the market. That means even the fastest gun in the west won't be able to renew their own name. It's not just that you have to manually renew it. It's also that you can't reserve it for renewal ahead of time. 
That is now the norm. So this "little feature" thats missing has completely nullified the entire purpose of the protocol in my opinion.  It's too late now.  The only way to undo the damage would be to start over and get basic shit like this in order on release day.

However claiming to be so well-versed in bitcoin, yet simultaneously stating "I've never heard of the guy" equates to living under a rock.  Or you're just completely full of shit, and you're trying to discredit a book written by someone you don't like.  Hes literally the most well-known individual in this space.  And you've never heard of him?  That slip up makes you sound like you've got a bias against "the guy", rather than his book. Which I've got a hunch is true, but I won't bother with that.  
You include personal attacks, condescension, and insults towards him as well. Which is very telling regarding your motives. I'd be curious to see if the myriads of errors you listed above stand the scrutiny of someone who knows the code. And is well-known to have no bias against the author.

They call Bitcoin the wild west now for a reason.  There's no accountability, very little punishment for those who are running off with customers funds, and no regulation. I've listened to Andreas opine on the need for zero regulation many times and got the same goosebumps you did.  I just don't understand how it would pan out in the real world.

That's right. I'm not one of them. I just have the ability, unlike several people in this group, to see things from both sides. When I present an alternate position, I do so because I genuinely want a more centric viewpoint to be considered.  I'm grossly averse to extremism or irrational nonsense.  So sometimes I have to speak up and say something that will get downvoted by ppl here.  The difference is my motives.  I genuinely want to discourage irrational extremism. Buttcoiners just want to start shit, derail conversations, and post with no genuine interest in discussion. 
You could've avoided improperly categorizing me by carefully reading what I write.  I realize that some of the more extremists here don't have the ability to entertain opposing viewpoints. So any opposing viewpoint must be "trolling". But that's why those people are extremists, and not rational individuals.

I think its hilarious to just say something can't work because the old system doesn't mesh well with it.  If everyone used that logic, Bitcoin and all its disruptive properties would be ignored.  Think outside the box a little bit.  You're a Bitcoiner.  We're dealing with something that streamlines countless processes that are currently manual, difficult, and inconvenient.  Why can't this also be improved?
The old way of doing payroll doesn't have to be the way it will be forever.  Solutions to each of these issues will be thought up. I am an intelligent employer and i would not avoid this option like the plague.  If you don't have cash laying around, maybe the new crop of employers will, to meet this need.  Things can change.  Evolve, and improve.  
More importantly:  Do you really think these guys haven't thought through every single facet of this situation already?   In my last debate with everyone on this topic, their whole premise was that it wasn't possible because (same as you) payroll processes circa 1985 wouldn't work well with it.  Yet they didn't have the 1st clue how BitWage was mitigating the risks and handling the issues.  They just wanted to be negative nancy's.

1)  I will repeat what I've already written several times in this thread.  My merchant fees are 2.5-ish% however after international rewards cards are factored in, my average merchant fees are above 6%.  There is nothing suspect about that.  The 2.6% rate is only for domestic non-rewards credit cards.  Many of my orders are international, and if someone has an airline card, I am paying upwards of 12% per transaction.  I have confirmed this with Bank of America Merchant Services, who handles my account.  I am in the process of finding a cheaper system, but suffice it to say there are hundreds of thousands dealing with this rate system.  That's why I laugh when I hear 2.5% merchant fees.  That's not the whole story.
2)  Bitpay allows free transactions up to $1 million a year in business.  So no.  Merchants don't necessarily have to pay 1% to Bitpay.  This point is irrelevant as merchants would just subtract that 1% from the discount they offer.
3)   No point in responding to this one.  You're grasping at straws just to be contrary.

This explains your inability to think outside the box. Without fail, those heavily steeped in legacy financial system thinking have always been the least capable of comprehending Bitcoin. (Because you are taught that everything is black and white, and only works by the rules you've learned in your textbooks)
This is going to require you to think differently about money. Completely. If you lack the ability to forget everything you've learned, and start over with a new viewpoint, you will always think Bitcoin is best for illegal transactions, and can never operate as a successful currency.

Thanks for clarifying.  I guess I need to stick with my (maybe erroneous) assumption that online merchants aren't a fringe segment, and that I am in a very large group of people paying similar rates.  Everyone is obsessing on the 12% comment I made.  I have clarified several times that my average rate sometimes reaches above 6%.  The 12%'ers are (according to my account manager at BofA Merchant services) isolated rewards cards from outside the USA.  Apparently that sent a couple buttcoin trolls into a monster hissy fit, but it is what it is.  Congratulations on being so successful.

Statements like this remind me of people who say global warming doesn't exist because it snowed today.  Faulty logic, lack of foresight, and a lack of understanding of the big picture. 
Determination of price is very simple math. It's simple supply and demand. 
Your entire premise is that there will be no demand. Yet you have no reason to back that statement up. 
You use the past as your justification that the future will hold no growth.  This too makes no sense. The past is a period of time where the infrastructure isn't quite ready yet.
My entire premise is that infrastructure is going up that will facilitate future usability, incentive, and thus demand. And when demand goes up, value increases. To be quite frank, you have absolutely zero evidence that the above statement is false. So you simply can't make the claim that the price won't go up. 
That's my point. If you pay attention to what's going on out there, all signs point to growth. But instead you look at the last 12 months, ignore what's going on out there, and hyperfocus on the market price. That's not how this works.
This is Bitcoin.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that you shouldn't look at 2011 to judge how 2012 will go.
Everyone who takes your position seems to ignore what's being done out "in the field".  As if it simply doesn't exist and an incomplete, immature ecosystem is how things always will be.

Agreed.   These are exactly the things I have been kicking and screaming that we need more of, to keep Bitcoin relevant in the coming years.  Without these things, I personally believe there is a risk of obsolescence.  
Wish that it wasn't a full year away.  I would be interested in a kickstarter to fund more developers to help out.   Not a presale or coins or anything like that.   Simply raising money to pay a developer or two extra a "salary" to work on it and hasten the completion.   We need things like this yesterday.   Now.   Not a year from now.

Sad but true.  Harsh reality we all need to embrace and come up with a solution for.  People need *incentive* to use Bitcoin. They don't know nor care about most of it's CURRENT features.

I'm not missing your point. I addressed your point directly. You are missing my point. Even if it was easy, as I said, they still wouldn't use it. Seamless or not, if they don't have incentive to use it in the first place, they won't use it. All you've done is repeat that it should be easy. That isn't the problem. It's easy to do a lot of things that people don't bother doing. You have to have incentive before you can blame difficulty.
Remittances would be the one case where there is incentive, and it's too difficult. But you made this sound global. The global problem with Bitcoin is not difficulty. It's lack of incentive. There's definitely a market for remittances. And you are correct it's too difficult right now. But the other 9 million things Bitcoin is good for, people don't have incentive to use it for that. Easy or not.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the quote above, but sidechains are not akin to a dude setting up shop in the corner of a successful business, and taking anything away from that Business.  Literally everything he does contributes to the parent business's increase in value.  Even if he becomes wildly popular, the very act of "using the parent company's tokens" to do so, increases the value of the parent company's tokens.  If he destroys some accidentally, this also increases the value of the parent company's tokens.  
The proper analogy is a major company buying a smaller company.  The smaller company provides a value-added service that makes the major company more valuable.  More flexible.  Improves the parent company's "product" by giving it new features.  Or better service.  And in this case, the smaller company can never just split off, or run away with the funds.  They're always going to be there.  Because their entire system is intertwined with the parent company and its tokens.
In the end, Bitcoin, even with thousands of sidechains, will remain the Godfather of them all.  Some of those sidechains will be massive money generators.  But they are going to need to subsist on the token called "Bitcoin" as their underlying "fuel".  Bitcoin will never, in such a scenario, lose popularity, or value, or network effect.  It will be the extensible protocol that powers myriads of financial infrastructures around the world.

Lets recap:
1)  Poster asks for just 1 reason why BTC is better than Credit Card.
2)  I respond with 2 reasons.
3)  You declare that I didn't answer his question.
4)  I realize you're a troll.  Because that statement made *0* sense.

Technically you are correct, he's disrupting the conversation, but hes also performing a service that's needed. A lot of people have to waste a lot of time here just pointing out the people who are trolls. Because there are so many.  And because those unfamiliar with the troll usernames, may take their comments to heart. So while you may technically be correct, I don't think calling out known trolls is disruptive in a bad way. 
Usually the conversation takes an irritatingly illogical and futilistic, retarded turn all of a sudden, and it only takes me but a moment to glance at the username and realized that said comment is coming from a well-known troll. It's always that irritation and frustration that makes me look at the user name in the first place. And I often have to point out that the person is a well-known troll, so others get why his comment is so ludicrous. CoughFrankehcough. Just my two cents

Why don't we go to the Bitcoin development team, whoever they are, wherever they are, and find out where this issue lies in the queue?  Assuming there is one.

@_date: 2014-09-02 23:15:04
No. You don't own less of it. You own just as much of it. It's just that what you own is represented with a smaller looking number. That's the key difference. Divisibility is the answer to your issue. Especially when it's infinitely divisible, like Bitcoin.

Yeah, I was going to say, really? The problem doesn't exist? It's pretty obvious the problem exists with centralized exchanges. Like Gox. Everybody agrees they need to be regulated. Bitcoin doesn't.

Oh. You're referring to above and beyond.   My personal reason is because I support Bitcoin as a concept, for countless reasons, and want to see it succeed.  So I am willing to give a discount. As for everyone else, why does any merchant give a discount?  To garner more business?  To attract new customers?  Isn't this obvious?  Business owners take a hit on shipping, or product pricing all the time to stay competitive.  The concept of taking a hit in one place to get more business overall is nothing new.  Maybe you can email NewEgg.com and ask why they offered 10% off for Bitcoin purchases.

True. Well you've already got guys like that VC dude, I forget his name, publicly declaring a need for someone to start managing the Bitcoin protocol project.

It's going to be an interesting thing to see if a completely decentralized development project can continue to meet important deadlines, goals, and milestones. In the end, this is a product for the entire financial world to use. I think that's what most people aren't getting. You want Bitcoin to take over the world, but still can't do 90% of the shit it needs to do, for that to happen. Unless you just want a peer-to-peer system where Sally sends Joe five dollars. If that's all Bitcoin will ever be? Then like I said, sit back and relax. We are done.

Because the only thing that makes the price go up is consumer adoption. Merchant adoption doesn't increase the price. Microsoft accepting Bitcoin does not change the lack of consumer adoption. Therefore the price doesn't move, aside from a $20 jump as we bitcoiners get our pants all jizzed-up.

Don't hold your breath. The Bitcoin Dev team doesn't comprehend product development or marketing.

They're not out in the financial world. That… Is the problem.

I've seen this mentioned several times. Not clear on something. If you purchase the coin's on Coinbase, it's going to be under your name and address. All the IRS has to do is ask coinbase for your account information, and everything you've ever done is right there. Whats the difference between moving those coins to another address, versus "shuffling" them? Everyone knows you can move coins easily.  Is the difference that there's no way to know where they went?  That just sets off red flags that they've been laundered.  They're gonna ask you where they went.  You'll still be assumed to have those coins.  Unless ANY move of coins equates to no longer possessing them. In which case you don't need to launder.  You can just do a one time move out of the Coinbase wallet.

Trolling in my opinion, is somebody who knows they are there just to say something negative. They have no intention of having a rational conversation. They just reply to every possible post with some sort of shit talking. It has absolutely nothing to do with someone's "freedom to disagree". It's the fact that they are hanging out somewhere, for the sole purpose of injecting negativity and contrarianism as much as they possibly can. They derail conversations that would've otherwise been productive. I didn't say circle jerking. I said productive. You can't have a productive conversation with someone who is there for the sole purpose of talking shit.  It's the intent that makes them a troll.

Wait, what? You ignore the one-year graph which is the only thing you can decipher a "slow fade back to the original price" with? And instead you focus on a one-month graph? That doesn't make any sense at all. Look at the one-year graph. We already came down. We then went up, and have plateaued at a higher price for a significant amount of time. There simply is no fade downward happening.

He's correct. How long have you been in this space? Those of us who've been here quite some time have seen that the more entrenched someone is in the Legacy financial system, the less able they are to comprehend bitcoin.  And the less willing they are to entertain it as an option at all. It is almost always those who are in financial careers that talk the most shit about Bitcoin. Because they can't see past their training. BTC requires people to think about money in an entirely different way.

Why is that the criteria? You're supposed to be able to send funds of any kind using Bitcoin, anywhere in the world. The only thing missing is a place to cash out. 
Western Union has contracts with every 7-Eleven on earth, and there's a 7-Eleven even in the remotest villages of Thailand these days. That's why it works. I see no reason why Bitcoin couldn't be doing the exact same thing.

I bailed on Doge after the "halving".  Mining became 50% less profitable and my electric bill was double what I was making.  Coincidentally it was around this time that Wolong disappeared, the pumps and dumps stopped, and the actual Doge economy was left to show it's vitality.  And it went completely stagnant.  Wolong was why Doge price kept skyrocketing.  In the end, it is *adoption* and *commerce* and *demand that outstrips supply* which causes price increases of any relevance. Not "novelty" or a sub-community of enthusiasts.

It's super fun and trendy to say that. But why don't you list those risks for us?  I'd bet your list elicits legit eyerolls from the well-versed here.  Meaning, not real risks. The true risk *was* no infrastructure, and subsequently no adoption. The chance of that happening now, is near zero.  This means the risk of BTC value plummeting is also near zero. People love to say Bitcoin is high-risk.  But they usually have little awareness of what's happening in the space.

It's because of this that I have only kept the blockchain app on my phone for spending, despite all the security fears. There's no way I'm going to put the coinbase app on my phone, and neither is anyone else, if you don't have an official app, controlled and programmed by your company alone.

Disagree totally.  I have always been in the camp that the problem is not "how hard it is to use".  Its that they have zero incentive to use it.

So once again, the argument against it is that "Companies are still doing stuff the old way" ?  So i guess Bitcoin is a pointless joke because paper money still exists?  And nobody will ever use it, because grandma in the grocery aisle is still writing paper checks for her groceries?  I guess we are stuck here forever then.  Nothing will ever change.  And BitWage has offered a feature with no forethought or solutions to address the basic concerns.  As always, conversations on Reddit are like the Twilight Zone for me.

Try to keep in mind that Expedia is just like Amazon.com. They are so big that they're able to undercut all other retailers on price. This is a common complaint in the Amazon/regular retail world already. You are always going to find things cheaper on Amazon.com, because they "can". I have run into this when trying to buy on Overstock instead of Amazon. Just so I can use my BTC. I don't think this is an issue of "Bitcoin retailers not being willing to offer discounts". Even with the discount, I don't think you'd have hit the Expedia price.

Andreas doesn't feel at ease about the 51% issue because he's fine with Bitcoin failing. He feels at ease with it because it's not a feasible business model for anyone trying to make money. It contradicts itself. And it would be noticed by the network quickly enough to never get very far. Those are his reasons.
@_date: 2014-12-26 15:03:58
You have to understand something in order to understand his comment. It is a factual statement that Bitcoin requires legacy financial people to completely rethink what money is. 
That's why so few of them are capable of grasping it right now. They've learned what money is in their classrooms, and just like doctors, they stick to their old fucking education without any furthering education. What they learned in 1985 in a textbook, is gospel forever. 
Bitcoin does, as a matter of fact, require people to completely rethink the definition of money. Therefore his statement that Warren Buffett doesn't understand money I believe is heavily powered by that sentiment. It's a concept that has repeatedly been raised here. Bitcoin critics rarely grasp the true definition of money. Even if they've been in the financial world for 40 years. They assume money needs certain elements in order to be money, which Bitcoin is literally proving untrue. Therefore his statement is not an idiotic one. It just lacked maybe some clarification. Probably because he assumes his audience knows what he means.

I'll  play. The "calm before the storm". Each time it went up, there was an uncontrollable reason for that. Some random event. So technical analysis would say that there's some crazy "hive" universal calm that washes over all of humanity, because the stars have aligned, and the gods (who are the only ones that can see the future), know that there is a random event coming which will skyrocket the price?  Therefore a calm is an actual *sign* of impending value increase?

But just because there's people that are willing to get ripped off, doesn't mean I have to agree with it or like it. 
I personally feel it does damage to the overall ecosystem because 80% of people are not stupid enough to pay that much. As a result, 80% of people are not going to partake in this element of the ecosystem. A very important part of the ecosystem as a matter of fact. And for that I am annoyed.

Insults aren't necessary. And I could say the same about your understanding of companies like Chase bank. I think it's a given that Chase bank doesn't care about decentralization. In fact they'd want the very opposite. Obviously. 
Aside from that, I'm trying to approach this like they would. Knowing nothing other than what they've heard. Blockchain technology enables frictionless international money transfers, at almost no expense.
The question then is, is it possible to make a Blockchain technology that accomplishes this, without the coin, and without the miners. I probably need to read through some of the other responses, because I see a lot of good information flooding this thread. So I will go do that now.

It always kills me when I get in massive fights with people on here after making a claim, then somebody comes along and verifies everything I said. I've been trying to tell people for months that merchant fees are a hell of a lot more than 3%. 
You're dead on when you say merchants pay for airline miles on rewards cards. That's exactly what happens. You literally are paying for the free miles people get. The credit card isn't paying for it. The airline isn't giving anyone any perks. The merchants buy them their free tickets. 
There are transactions that I've paid upwards of 10% on thanks to International rewards cards. You just don't see them because at the end of the month you get a bill and few look at the itemization.
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:57:20
If you were aware of all the facts, you would know that all signs point to an initial incompetence followed by months, and years of hiding the truth. That's where the maliciousness came in.
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:22:23
Apparently you failed basic math. They aren't losing money. They can offer a 1% discount and still make money over credit card transactions. They can offer, sometimes even a 3% discount and break even. Some of my customers international rewards cards cost me much higher than 3%.  So still wouldn't be losing money. But then again, looking at your post history, you are a troll. And trolls always say shit that is contrary, even if it doesn't make sense.
I also never said this was the "only" way to create consumer incentive. It's a way.  There are major merchants offering discounts. I guess we're all wasting our time. Which means you also failed Marketing 101. Then again, you are a buttcoin troll.  So none of this was ever actual sincere conversation in the first place.

They are not losing money.  They are breaking even because they are avoiding Merchant Fees.  They are also getting new customers in the process.  NewEgg offers 10% off with bitcoin purchases and everyone cheers in amazement. Someone writes a post suggesting all merchants do that, and people write scathing replies.  Welcome to reddit.
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:54:35
That's crazy to me. I'm the worlds biggest dick when it comes to dealing with support people. I'm convinced they all have an IQ smaller than a mouse. But BitPay's support has been phenomenal for my merchant account. Complicated issues were handled with complex responses, indicating total understanding of the situation. I literally never see that with support teams.

Oh don't get me started on chargebacks.  And don't get me started on the guy who used stolen credit cards to slowly siphon tens of thousands of dollars of inventory from my store, and had it shipped to empty houses that were for sale in the UK.  Which of course resulted in tens of thousands in chargebacks, and lost inventory.  All because of our beloved credit card system.  You don't have to be a "Libertarian" with "Fantasy money" to see the value of promoting an alternate payment system, by passing on discounts like this.

@_date: 2014-08-15 17:17:37
Just understand that these things you list are very passive motivators. They don't get mass quantities of people on board. If something is slightly less of a pain in the ass because they have to reach for the phone instead of fold open their wallets, that isn't much of an incentive. Incentives for consumers are extremely small. It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out in the mass consumer adoption arena.

Peter, I'm totally new here, so I probably shouldn't comment. But is the situation really so bad that there's no way to implement a solution? With the current structure in place? Nobody you can talk to, no rallying or group meetings you can call together among the teams etc?  All I ever hear on this topic is people throwing their hands up in the air. But we supposedly have "programmable money". Obviously there will be parties that resist. But in the end, consensus should be possible, and able to be implemented, for the better of the economy. After all, it's a bug fix like everything else. Get it in the queue. What's the path to fixing the problem?  Rather than freaking out and selling 50% of your coins, then declaring it publicly and scaring the shit out of everyone?
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:44:17

Is that the problem?  They're antisocial?  I figured I had said some trigger keywords that upset anarchists or libertarians.  Maybe the words "wealthy investors".  Aside from that, I can't figure out what's bad about the idea.  
The beloved Andreas Antonopoulos has recommended on countless occasions to give away Bitcoins on Paper Wallets because that is the single most effective way to get people interested in, and begin learning about / following Bitcoin.  Its a no brainer.  
Imagine having a funded effort whereby those who have a lot of money and a lot of Bitcoins, and want to see the paradigm change succeed, can contribute directly to distributing Bitcoin to thousands of new yorkers.  It's an investment in the future of Bitcoin, and directly grows its userbase as well.

Simply not constitutional. Therefore the bit license should be completely thrown out. We do not need to politely ask for exceptions.

It's far more likely these idiots simply missed the Bitcoin train, and this is how they take out their irritation with it. If you notice, their main mocking point is that we hope Bitcoin will be worth a lot one day. That's a clear indication that these mental midgets are upset about the value of the coin. Which leads me to believe that they missed the cheap coin train. Not that theyre bankers or Shilling.

Having read both it seems the lawyer actually did tell the first guy end of 2014. Then she backtracked because he quoted her. And now she's just sticking with "probably a year". There seems to be a chronology of events worth noting there. I'd say the first response was probably a little more honest. She just didn't want to be quoted.

Wait until they randomly shut down your account with no explanation, seizing $5,000 thats pending on something you already shipped.  Or hold your money for 3 weeks claiming someone issued a chargeback, when nobody did. Then reverse the charge anyway and you lose $1500 &amp; slap your account with restrictions.  And the whole time you were just twiddling your thumbs minding your own business. That's why people hate PayPal. Just the tip of the iceberg.

Here's the thing. I'm not an expert myself. Just like developers technically shouldn't be making product/sales/marketing decisions in the code. And the product development people shouldn't be touching the code.  
"Pull requests" technically should be originating from product development people. People who have researched the market, and know what Bitcoin needs to do to help the most people, and still stay true to its ideologies. 
There's nobody doing this. There's a bunch of programmers making product development decisions. This is a monumental no no. 
And I don't know the solution. A decentralized product development team maybe? Up to this point, I believe the Bitcoin foundation has played that role, somewhat.  But everybody, in every company, on planet earth, knows that you don't ask the programmer what the product should do. 
Not that he's an idiot. It's just that he's not out in the field. He's not talking to the various industries, to see what they need. Maybe there's 50 extremely tiny tweaks they could make to Bitcoin that would make it extendable to 50 new industries. But who's out there finding that out? We've got nobody. 
This is just a personal concern of mine. You can rest assured that as more wealthy turds in the financial industry pour money into Bitcoin, they are going to start throwing their weight around, and demanding some structure, and progress in development. Not sure any of us wants that.  I guess the lighthouse project is one step… I sure hope there will be Prod Dev people in that process. Not just developers.

Dummy here. Can somebody explain why the cost of mining necessarily has to go up in direct proportion to value of Bitcoin? That presupposition is mentioned in the post above. But I don't necessarily think that's true. Is it? 
Did the cost of mining go up tenfold when Bitcoin shot from $100 to $1000?
@_date: 2014-08-29 01:41:46
I had not heard that it went up to $200,000. Previously, very recently, it was $100,000 for full body preservation. I believe $50,000 for just the head. There is another company that does this for cheaper.  Yes, there are life insurance policies that you can take out which will fund it for you.

To correct some assumptions:  1). It's CHASE bank.  2).  It's a business account that does over $1 million a year in deposits and has been an active account for 13 years.   Average balance is $20,000.  3).  I clearly said, multiple times, it was a tinfoil hat theory. Do you know what that means? Apparently not.  Next?  PS:  You're pretty cocky for being so completely wrong on so many levels.  They hold any check over $200.  Period.  And that was *not* the case 10 years ago.  Even just 4 years ago they would only hold checks that were larger than $1000. It has slowly gotten smaller and smaller.  And bullshit they don't make money off it.  Where do you think that money goes for *5* business days?  It's collecting interest or doing something else.  At least that's the conspiracy theory I'm sticking with. Why?  Because on a 13-year-old business account with over 1 million in deposits each year, they have zero actual concern of fraud. Therefore they've got incentive to do this for some other reason. And that is the reason I'm going with.

You've got to be knowingly making idiotic comments, because everything coming out of your fingers is factually incorrect on some level.  Companies are not all converting to fiat.  Overstock is retaining 20%. The entire process is less than 4 months old. Where was the US Dollar after it's first 4 months of merchant adoption, before consumer adoption had even begun?  Give Bitcoin 100 years like the US Dollar has been given. Then your comparisons will begin to reach relevant.

You can target social network advertising on Facebook to specific cities, and even specific demographics within those cities. And it's not that expensive. Especially if you target down small enough. You'll get word-of-mouth going. 
There's a lot of ways to advertise now that don't require huge budget. Even as simple as walking around Rancho Bernardo or Mira Mesa (in San Diego), and leaving flyers on peoples front doors.
I could talk to the leader of the meet up group in San Diego, and see if they'd be interested. I'm in Miami. No Filipinos here. But if you get San Diego on to this, you have an amazing beginning user base. The question is… How do they get the money in and get the money out?

Hi Gavin.  Hoping you see my question and can answer it.  Do you support the decentralization of the product development process?  I feel that in general, developers aren't best equipped to decide on product development priorities.  Not because they're dumb.  But because their expertise is not in sales and marketing, and they are not out in the "field" dealing with the people directly.  It seems to me that a community-wide or world-wide voting system for the direction, enhancements, and timelines for Bitcoin protocol development would be an outstanding idea.  I realize that lay people are not best at making technical decisions.  So there would of course be a "back and forth" process.  But including the world in the evolution of the Bitcoin protocol seems both obvious and mandatory for something like Bitcoin.  A few core devs making all the decisions, deciding on timelines, and prioritizing what needs to get done is not a smart move.  Thoughts?

Is your post about consumer adoption?  Your title is.  But your post only talks about Merchant incentives/adoption.  Not to be a negative nancy, but the general public doesn't have incentive to use Bitcoin and the same problem will exist for them using Open Bazaar.  Why would they bother when they've got Amazon.com?  (talking about consumers now, as thats what your title said). I don't believe another online store accepting Bitcoin is what will incentivize users to begin purchasing bitcoins en masse.  Its a great option for Merchants, but merchants already have all the incentives when it comes to Bitcoin.  The problem is consumers have none.  We've already got a bunch of stores that accept BTC for products, which don't have horrible reputations tied to them.

Not a good analogy.  Bitcoin is not close to that stage yet.  It only exists because Govts are allowing the banks and businesses to operate with exchanges.  I guess the answer to my question is:  "When everything can be bought and sold in BTC and fiat is not needed at all, then Govts can't ban it". Because ppl won't need to cash out to fiat.  Right now they do need that. Therefore right now Bitcoin is bannable, in those countries.  China?

Realizing that their business model is dead means they must give oxygen to Bitcoin soon. I think they know this. The companies that make money in situations where their industry is being made obsolete are the ones who embrace and adapt, or cash in on it as much as possible before they die. They may be waiting until critical mass before they begin.  But this is what's coming next.  
Remember. Western Union has something unique that no other company has.  Contracts already in place with literally tens of thousands of "cashing out" brick &amp; mortar locations. 711's and convenience stores in the farthest jungle towns of Thailand. That is something that would take tens of years to reproduce from scratch.  Zero companies are even bothering to attempt this (still) in the Bitcoin space.  Even though this is Bitcoins most obvious industry to take over. (I don't include the ATM companies)
I think we will see an inclusion of Bitcoin in some form, from Western Union.

Neither response really answered your question.  The right way to perceive this is the size of the economy right now.  While things are still new, and so few people are in the "pond", its easy for those with a lot of coins to manipulate it.  As infrastructure grows out there, and more people get on board, the pond grows, and the whale's influence decreases.  Bottom line is that Bitcoin is still brand new, and still small, and still growing.  We've all resigned ourselves to putting up with the whale behavior as we patiently wait for the pond to turn into a lake, and then an ocean.  At that point, whales wont be able to even disturb the surface of the water.  Decentralization benefits will be realized then.

Try to remember that what a few Wall Street people do in the United States, may not amount to a hill of beans in the overall price. Unlike a company stock, which is localized and tiny, Bitcoin is worldwide, and America's delusions of grandeur are going to begin to dissolve because of it. So Joe-American-stock-trader's pull on Bitcoin's price will likely be irrelevant as all of Africa, Asia, and Europe will also be involved. It's easy to disturb a puddle.

For anyone looking to buy one of these from someone, be safe and request additional verification of authenticity. Like the box it was shipped in from the actual company, with postage info on it. Or email correspondence from the company, receipt for purchase... something. I don't see what's stopping anyone from printing this thing on a piece of newspaper and calling it "real". Having the whole newspaper would be important too. I've seen these listed as just the front page. Framed or whatever. The certificates of authenticity from these newspaper companies could easily be printed out on any ink jet printer. They don't seem to realize the importance of stamps, or other identifying marks.

I have spent the last month reviewing merchant accounts, because I need to switch to someone cheaper. Not once have I seen anybody that is offering 1%, or anything significantly below 2.5%. Who offers these rates? Because I need to sign up with them tomorrow. Please post the company name in response. I will go check out the rates to confirm. The absolute cheapest I've found is Shopify. If you pay $175 a month, you get something like 2.17%. That's the lowest I've ever seen. You may be getting significantly huge discounts because of your high-volume. But that is not the norm. You are an exception in that regard. I don't have anywhere near 1100 orders per day. And I would say most small business owners don't.

I'm not sure any of those things is relevant. If Chase decided to make a Chase coin, and let all it's customers use it, nobody would complain.  They'd also add a shit ton of benefits for all of Chase customers. Incentives to use it.  Something Bitcoin lacks right now.  In fact they would probably make a system that is full of really great features and functionality. Whereas Bitcoin has to sit virtually unchanged for months, out of fear that the code might break. Nobody's going to care if it's centralized or not. And there's no reason to assume it would "fail". It's simply a new feature for significantly cheaper money transfers around the world, from a well-established business. Why would it fail?  Chase coin. Why can't it exist and work?  That's what I'm wondering.

If you thought I was implying that they did it to further Bitcoin adoption, then you're an idiot :-).

First off, linking me to some editorial opinion piece in an online magazine, does not equate to a published study. I posted published studies. There are plenty of idiots saying incorrect information on the Internet. That's not proof of anything. Secondly, I'm not going to chill out. He's a doctor. He's supposed to be a steward of our health, and yet none of them have a clue what they're talking about. They don't continue their education, practically ever. And they will sooner call someone a hypochondriac, than sit down and actually troubleshoot a mysterious health condition. Believe me. I know what I'm talking about. Doctors are a joke in the age of the Internet. Read the studies I linked to in my post. None of your "studies" contain any actual data that negates what's in them. Sorry.

Even if Bitcoin was easy as pie, people don't have incentive to use it. The problem is lack of incentive across the board. Not difficulty. Difficulty comes in a close second. But even if it was extremely simple, people still wouldn't be using it right now. Because they have no need for it. At least here in the United States and other developed countries.   Therefore, the biggest problem is not ease-of-use. It's lack of incentive.

The reason why has been explained several times on this page already.  Check the other posts from me here.  Major merchants are doing this in the real world already with Bitcoin.

Do you really believe this? In order to believe this, you would have to be ignoring the simple math involved in price-value-increase as it pertains to increased adoption. It's really really simple math. It's not based on a belief system or superstition, or a delusion. 
It's as simple as this: if infrastructure keeps growing, adoption will as well, and price therefore will go up. So why do you ignore all of that and say we won't see $1,000 or $10,000?   Do you realize how little adoption is necessary to break $1000?
PS:  you're dead right about Willy and Marcus bots being the reason for the previous jump, but that was sudden.  And fake. This would be gradual. And organic.

You are not understanding the difference between organic value dictated by authentic supply and demand based on adoption and commerce, versus the muddied-up mess of heavily manipulated markets and those who react to fake pump &amp;amp; dumps as emotional buyers/sellers.

He said give your coins to someone, rather than just "forget about them". The down votes are likely because people would prefer the individual forgets about them.

Because of some business connections I have with distributors in India, I can get pretty much any prescription medication for personal use, at roughly a 99% discount off USA prices. One of the most extreme examples would be Viagra which I believe runs for something like $20 per pill in United States. It's available from overseas at about $0.20 per pill. 
Other medications like finasteride/Propecia are $55 for a one-month supply in the USA. Can be obtained for $1.75 from Cipla pharmaceuticals overseas. 
Moral of the story? We're being violently anally ass raped by American pharmaceutical companies who are literally adding a 90% markup on all their medications.

We've got the first fucking worldwide public ledger of accounts to work with. Does someone need to sit down with law enforcement and teach them how to trace funds using the blockchain, as part of their investigations?  
I know with Gox, this entire concept seems to be overlooked, while "subgroups" are doing tons of "independent research".   Dont think the left hand (LE) knows what the right hand (indep groups) is even doing.  And it shouldn't be that way.   With this issue, it may or may not be applicable, but if those funds are still available somewhere, a legal precedent should be set which ensures they get transferred where they're supposed to go.

I wish I had the same confidence you do that if people simply never use it, merchants won't remove Bitcoin as a payment option. I honestly think they will, if a year or two goes by, and people just aren't using it. That's why I do feel there's a time constraint. You're correct that it's free. But we've already seen Mozilla remove it for their own personal reasons.

I don't know how that jives with my "rational" side.  I have to cater to my brain which tends to think of both sides of the coin most of the time.  (no pun intended).  If you don't want even the services related to Bitcoin to be regulated, then you must want total anarchy, and a thousand more MtGox's.  That's the only conclusion I can come to.  I don't think regulating the fallable, corruptable humans that run Bitcoin businesses, is a bad thing.  The regulations just need to be akin to internet regulations.  Not excessive, and leaving room to breathe.

I am in a position of power in my circles, and I have had to put up with the paranoias and conspiracy theories of those who participate in my business.  I have seen the most insane, ridiculous shit get conjured up out of thin air, and its always related to fears of corruption and ill intent by those in power, when there literally was *none*.  So I know how people can create a reality that does not exist.  I also pride myself on not letting my power affect me.  Its really not that hard to avoid turning into an asshole.  Maybe for some.  I have a strong hatred for the FDA because there is corruption there as well.  But i would have to be a total fucking idiot to deny that their rules and regulations have saved millions of lives.  They have.  And rules do work.  And are needed.  I just wish they could all be automated by math and physics.  Maybe one day....

Disagree. His entire argument is that it's not a well-established, global currency. That's his argument? Give it some time. Seriously. I've never understood people who use this argument. His argument that something sucks is because there's more people in the Kuwait rewards program? Therefore it's simply not a currency?  What?
He's blatantly ignoring that it's used in commerce every single day as a currency. He's intentionally ignoring reality and claiming it doesn't exist. While simultaneously criticizing it for not acting like a 100-year-old established currency. The entire argument is ludicrous. I don't see how you found any value in what he said.  If the guy actually gave some examples as to why it's not a currency, then we'd have something to work with. But he completely avoided the topic and started talking shit instead. And started name calling.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:48:30
True.  But it still feels like a "passive" benefit. Things that get people incentivized are money savings, perks, extremely unique selfish pluses. For example, if bitcoin had, up to this point, seen a gradual increase in value. Proving its "deflationary" nature, I could see consumers jumping on board in mass, recognizing it as a deflationary currency that will make them money over time if they hop on board.  But the charts don't convey that aspect of Bitcoin yet. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 03:09:40
Bitcoin has a much greater percentage chance. Because people are terrified of something new. The topic is money. And they will be latching onto anything with a good, stable reputation. As Bitcoin becomes more established, it will become that. Something new will just be another insane, stupid, high-risk, dangerous endeavor, in the mind of the average person.  This Bitcoin has security for longevity.

There are much bigger fish to fry, if you want to have something to worry about related to Bitcoin. Such as the lack of progress in development. The lack of direction in development. The lack of a timeline, or plan in development. The lack of consumer incentive to even care about Bitcoin. All of your mining woes won't mean a thing if these issues aren't fixed.

1)  I've been at this for 14 years.  How long have you dealt with merchant companies? Most people don't pay 2.5%. They've paid much more than that after fees/international/etc. Only with the advent of companies like Shopify have we begun to see flat rates that state 2.5% and stay at 2.5%.
And by the way, who fucking cares if they 2.5% or more than 2.5%? This thread is about passing whatever savings you get, onto the customer.  Period.  Please go argue with your wall. 
2)  Nobody said they would ignore the 1%.  I said your point is irrelevant because they would just deduct the 1%.  You are trying *way* too hard to find shit to bitch about.

I'm in agreement with you. Despite your downvotes. There's really no indication that some secretary or intern didn't just rattle off a bunch of payment options while writing this document. There's 1,000,000 miles between a summary doc about a future conversation, and what actually gets implemented. It's lack of prominence in the document could simply indicate that they plan to have it as a payment option on their mobile app. Buried in the back end with all the other payment options. Which would indicate that it's still just as legit on the radar. But fingers crossed.

Don't stress about those here who say your bank may burn down or steal your wallets.  Visit your box once a year.  Important to show you're still around. 
You can then just continue sending more coins to those addresses as they sit in the bank. I printed out a few extras, so I could begin adding coins to newer wallets without having to visit the bank.

Consumers need incentive to buy Bitcoin.  Not just "have it available" or see that its "its easy to acquire" or "there are places to spend it".

I spoke to the CEO of a fairly well known Bitcoin hedge fund. He's a personal friend of mine. In casual conversation, he said he had spoken to the CEO of coinbase and was told that they had to hand over all their customer information going back to a certain date. That they are considered money transmitters, and subject to standard money transmitter laws, which may include providing all customer information to the IRS as well, no matter what. In further conversation with him just now, he clarified that maybe only customers over a certain dollar threshold trigger paperwork that coinbase must send to the IRS, but customer information is still being provided. I don't know if that just means first and last names or what. 
Not sure if this is really any different than what PayPal already has to do. Which is any customer with over $20,000 in transactions *and* 200 transactions in a calendar year, they must report that customers financial activity to the IRS. Anyone under that threshold does not get reported, and the onus is on the customer to self-report. This may have been a case of incorrectly conveyed thirdhand information. I will update if I get any more info. Either way, coinbase asking me for my Social Security number is uncomfortable, so I stopped using them.

They have a good reputation. One of the few that hasn't been hacked. Probably the most professionally run Bitcoin company to date.

To be fair, when he says he doesn't want everyone making a bitcoin business, in context, he's referring to criminals. Regulations would discourage criminals/incompetents like Mark Karpeles from defrauding hundreds of millions out of consumers. You may feel that violates the spirit of Bitcoin still, but just wanted to clarify. My understanding is that we actually do want regulation for the centralized services surrounding Bitcoin. What we don't want is regulation for Bitcoin itself.

I believe this should be the hottest topic in reddit right now. Consumers have no incentive to use Bitcoin whatsoever. Merchants have all the incentives. Consumers already have perfectly good payment options that don't require any thought or effort whatsoever. Even if Bitcoin was just as easy to use, why would they use it? Only the few that care about privacy would take the time to bother. We have programmable money that is in need of serious feature enhancements for it to be viable as a commercial currency payment system. And the Dev team isn't bothering to do anything about it. This is a major problem.

Any number of reasons. Sure some will be lazy and leave it there. But if you are not seeing sales, there's a frustration element that comes into play. Especially with small business owners.  I run a website with 200,000 unique visitors every month, and not a single person has used bitcoin despite the fact that we offer 10%!off.  If I didn't give a shit about the meaning behind the technology, I wouldn't leave it on my store if it's not performing.
Bigger companies may call it "streamlining" their payment options. It's a very common concept for businesses both big and small to only offer services that convert to sales. And remove the ones that don't. I think it's somewhat silly to assume that people are just going to leave an element in their payment options that does nothing but clutter up the checkout screen, if one of those elements has zero activity for extended periods of time.

Peter why don't you head up the very first community-wide voting system for code changes? I assume this doesn't exist. And I'm really confused why not?  Seems like a necessity in a fully decentralized, worldwide system. Community should control decisions. Bitcoin is perfect for a voting tool.  And "political" influence is rendered irrelevant when you've got the first worldwide, fraud-proof voting system.

You're missing the point of the article. There's no incentive for them to bother doing all of that. That's the point. They have perfectly good payment options already. Merchants have all the incentives. Consumers have none. This is the problem we are going to see with adoption going forward.

What dolt wrote this?  Apple doesn't block Bitcoin wallets.  And Apple Pay is nothing more than a new way to use 60-year old Visa/MasterCard tech. There is zero indication that other payment methods can't be added in the future, and now I see a clear way Bitcoin could easily be integrated for the masses. 
This is amazing for Bitcoin because it digitalizes spending money, in the minds of the consumer public.  It kills the need for a "tangible" form of money.  This was a huge hurdle in the minds of consumers, and it's about to dissolve.  
Apple Pay only facilitates a new way to pay - with existing payment options. It seems like an ideal way to add new types of payment options like Bitcoin in the future.

You basically just agreed with me. There is a difference between the manipulated price, and the "real" price. So I don't understand why all of you are trying to argue with me. This is a very simple concept. 
The only number that matters to me is the "real" value. The only number that matters to you guys is the current value, because you're trying to play the numbers and make money. That's still not organic value. I'm actually looking at Bitcoin as a protocol, and a technology, and my interest is in its actual value, via commerce and adoption.

I still think the issue is that nobody has incentive to change how they pay. And that includes Apple pay.  I've stood at a hundred Apple Pay-enabled terminals, said "eeeehhhhhnnhghhghg" to myself, and just swiped my credit card the old fashion way anyway.  
This lack of incentive is true for Bitcoin too. So first one to build consumer incentive will command the market.  
Merchants really should be passing on their savings to consumers in the form of purchase price discounts.  That's one major unique thing Bitcoin has, that Apple Pay never will.  I offer 10% off on my store.  Merchants - stop being greedy and let's do this.

I'm not going to entirely avoid mentioning something just because you have a paranoia about how it's delivered. But is delivery really your concern?  Your message seems to be to completely avoid certain topics. You come across like somebody vying to keep the banks "loved".  There are serious, extremely corrupt things going on in banks.  Intelligent people can convey that without sounding like cultists.  In fact most people already know about it.  So it can simply be referenced in passing, which I've done, and received knowing "nods" in response. I get that you don't want the crazies promoting Bitcoin.

Technically I didn't say it has no effect on consumer adoption. Ultimately you need to have Merchant adoption before consumer adoption. But the price doesn't change because of Merchant adoption.

Am I the only one out there who has a moral conflict with just giving shit to the homeless? I know this probably isn't a popular opinion, but it's been bothering me for months. There's like this blanket viewpoint that homeless = give them shit. And that's how you help. I couldn't disagree more. I could probably go on for pages as to why, but in summary, giving them shit doesn't make a difference. They still need to eat tomorrow. They still have no job. They still aren't doing anything about their situation. 
Whether the reason is alcoholism, laziness, drug addiction, or mental illness... It seems to me that just giving them shit all the time throws money down the drain, and does absolutely nothing to change their situation. It's like an endless black hole for money to dissappear into.  Always needing more. Never having enough. That's why I never could donate to Sean's outpost or any other homeless outreach. They aren't making a difference in my opinion. They're being enablers for a group of people who have stopped trying.  
I don't claim to know the solution. But I know that this isn't it. And therefore I don't support it.  I think it's one of those things that society just assumes is "good". No matter what.  Therefore it should be mindlessly supported. And people like me I guess are total dicks. 
60 Minutes had a special several months ago about giving homeless people free apartments. You guessed it. More than half of them ended up passed out drunk on their complementary couches in their  complementary living rooms.

It's an e-commerce website.  Cosmetics and personal care type products for men and women.  My only issue with BitPay is the usability of their dashboard/admin area. It's very unintuitive for me. I remember commenting to a support rep over a year ago about this, and they agreed, said it was a known issue, and mentioned that they hoped to be revamping it soon. Looks the same today. The service has been stellar though.

I can think of a better strategy to destroy Bitcoin. Let developers make product development decisions. 
Every person who downvoted me doesn't have a clue about proper product development processes. Anyone who does, knows that the first rule of product development is you don't let programmers make decisions on features, timelines, or priorities.  
And this isn't my opinion. This is a universal rule of product development, project management, and business.  
As for the "why", you're seeing it play out with this block size issue.  You've got (1) about a bunch of coders (2) w inflated egos and (3) zero knowledge of finance (4) bickering for months on end about (5) what's good for a product they're making for (6) an audience that has NO INPUT.  
That's why you don't let developers make product development decisions.  Programmers are supposed to code.  Not decide the direction or priority of a product.

Those numbers dont include interchange fees for international cards, nor do they address companies that charge extra for international rewards cards.  And no.  I am not pulling this out of my ass.  What would be the point of creating an entire thread based on a total lie?  What kind of fool would do something like that?  I have much better things to do on a Sunday afternoon.  Im being honest.  
Merchant account contracts are different for everyone (at least with bank of america) so I would need to show you my contract. I do just under $1 million in business per year, so I have negotiated rates with them (which are horrible despite the negotiation). BofA does not use flat fees for everyone.  Thats why nothing is posted on their wall.  
Now, if you were to be a Shopify customer - you'd be sitting pretty.   I would be saving roughly $2500 a month in merchant fees alone.  They do not charge for international cards.  They have a flat fee across the board.  Your 2.5% is 2.5% no matter what.  The lady at Bank of America told me that was "impossible" and there was no way they could pull that off.  But its real.  Unfortunately I hate shopify templates and want to stay with Magento.  So I will probably be switching to Authorize.net.  They too have international card fees, but I believe its a flat rate.

This is IBM stating they will not be using the Bitcoin blockchain for the "Internet of things". The biggest new industry of the next five years. 
Because it's too big. Whether or not protocol enhancements could address the size of the Blockchain, this shows you that companies will not use Bitcoin if its limitations are not addressed immediately. 
They will simply copy it and make their own. Just like I have predicted countless times. Stop putting off these things until "later".

Offer 3% off for people who pay in Bitcoin.   I realize this means you break even on CC fees.  However, I have an online store too, and technically, my rates are about 7% after you factor in international rewards cards.  Im seriously going to incentivize my userbase by offering 10% off all purchases with Bitcoin.  Then again, I want the technology/currency to succeed.  Not just doing it for a quick buck.
@_date: 2014-10-03 04:13:23
When you hear about companies entertaining Blockchain technology, they're not necessarily talking about Bitcoin.  You can have Blockchain without Bitcoin.   You can't have Bitcoin without Blockchain.
IBM is making their own blockchain.  They'll be forking Ethereum too.  In both cases, you get the Blockchain without the pesky Bitcoins.  (pesky being his mentality, not mine)
EDIT:   Just watched the video in full.   For some reason he doesn't see why coins are needed at all.  And maybe they're not.   Maybe they are.  I guess it depends on the business model.  Coins provide incentive to invest in a good idea.  Its simply like owning a share in a company.  He doesn't grasp why coins are an integral part of the equation.  And I don't know the answer to that.  Can someone explain why he's wrong?

Here's some more tinfoil for you. 10 years ago, banks would hold your check deposit only if it was over $5000. Established customers never dealt with check deposit holds. Fast forward 10 years. I deposited a US treasury government check in the amount of $300, and they held $200 of it for five business days. What do you think they were doing with that money? Well they're stealing it, and investing it, and making money off of it. Then giving it to me. Under the dishonest guise of "fraud prevention". Banks make a practice of making money this way.

I am a huge proponent of marketing. I believe without it, the greatest products will never be used. Do you think there's any chance the bitcoin foundation can begin to take advantage of media outlets to play a role as an educator and a marketer for all of the possibilities of bitcoin? 
I feel like even as a centralized organization, these types of efforts would be welcomed by every type of personality in the community. And be monumentally beneficial to the ongoing adoption, education, and use of bitcoin in real-world situations. 
Television commercials. Media. Press. Interviews. Crowdfunding a Super Bowl ad. I know the bitcoin foundation already plays an educational role of sorts. But I'm thinking more so mass media. Positive press. Get the conversations going. 
Point out how it can be used. Raise millions of dollars purely for these efforts, and I guarantee you will see the money, and have the support of the entire community. Most importantly, I think these types of efforts will be the most influential ways to further the technology.

Nationalism / Borders can suck it.  I've always felt that way.  What a ridiculous, caveman mentality to kill each other over areas of dirt.

Bunch of idiots fighting amongst each other as we inhabit one of the most incredible miracles in the Universe.  A planet teaming with life.  Yet we are utterly unaware of perspective, and the physical truth that we are all one.  People worship their flag like it's a God.  They pledge allegiance to it like an Idol.  They die for it. Their Bible is the Constitution. And they engage in hatred and divisiveness for absolutely no good reason. I wish the people of earth were "one".

I don't think the community's attitude is that relevant to Bitcoins success or failure. What's relevant is the fact that coders are controlling the product vision with no financial background, no experience out in the field, and no interaction with the entrepreneurs who are trying to build products and services around it.  
We talk about the protocol being this great foundational platform upon which anything could be built. But I guarantee there's people trying to build stuff that can't. And there needs to be some communication between those people and the core dev team.  As far as I know, there is none.  You've got a bunch of developers arguing amongst themselves about what they want it to do. 
Meanwhile MasterCard may come along and undercut the entire effort, because MasterCard doesn't let it's developers decide what the fuck it's product is going to do. MasterCard has sales people, research analysts, psychologists, and economists deciding what the product is supposed to do.
Bitcoins scalability issues and other possible lacking features seems to be it's throttling point. A bunch of people bitching on Reddit about libertarian ideals doesn't stop a bitcoins potential or ability to compete in the marketplace. It's code could.

People here just like to ask the question back to whoever comes up with a good idea. It's their way of not actually doing anything themselves. So clearly if you have a good idea, you're supposed to get out there and start filming commercials yourself I guess. 
I'm fully on board with this idea. I suggested it a year and a half ago. We just need somebody with sales skills to talk to all the VC funded companies and get their buy-in. Someone to do the lighthouse campaign. And somebody with experience doing television marketing.

Bottom line is this. While the Bitcoin market is still tiny, it's going to be manipulated. Joe Schmoe in the USA can't do a damn thing about that. The point, again, was that these guys actually think they can control something that's worldwide. 
Just providing regulated exchanges, doesn't stop other exchanges from existing. And no, I don't believe there will be some sudden altruistic mass-exodus to the regulated exchanges, leaving Mr. Cambodia sitting by himself. That kind of logic is utterly retarded. 
As the economy grows, manipulation will be much more difficult, and that sort of thing will die down. But the creation of a regulated exchange tomorrow isn't going to do a damn thing to the guy overseas who's manipulating the price right now. That was the point. And it's a factual statement that can't be refuted.

You're right.  See that's the thing. It's only 21 million. That sounds like maybe a lot. 
But when you think about how many people are on this planet…
I know just random people that have one bitcoin. That's one less bitcoin on the market. 
They're not going to cash it in. They know to hold it for 30 years. 
But that's one less bitcoin. And another less bitcoin.  And I've got my bitcoins. 
And there's only 21 million.

We're talking about two completely different things.  You're describing people who are snarky but say things which are usually right.  Or at least contribute to the conversation.  Butthurtcoin trolls come here and post shit that makes *zero* sense.  They will see a 200 word post and pick out 3 words to harp on, even if its completely off topic.  The point is that their goal isn't to show how smart they are.  Its to be contrary, disruptive, and derail conversations.  That's the definition of a troll.  This is a stark contrast from a hipster who thinks he's smart.  These are people who missed the Bitcoin price jump train and now just want to cause problems.

Umm, they?  You can't group 25,000 users into one opinion. The vast majority of the people on that sub simply want larger blocks on-chain. But they also are in favor of SegWit/Layer 2 functionality.  Just like on this sub, there are a few extremists/trolls/crazies. But they don't define the rational majority. 
If you ever want to resolve this, you can't just create a reality that doesn't exist. You have to listen to what people are actually saying. And what they are saying is they don't want a centralized, for-profit company having any say in the Bitcoin code.  Especially if that means changing Bitcoin from an on chain scaling peer-to-peer electronic cash into a limited, restricted backbone that facilitates profits for the aforementioned centralized company. 
However I've plainly seen them say "more power to you blockstream" in your efforts to make a shit ton of money. Nobody's opposed to it. Roger's not opposed to it. I'm not opposed to it. We need a layer 2 financial industry on top of the Bitcoin block chain. Blockstream is free to pursue that. But not if it means forcing everything off chain and into Layer 2 company coffers. 
I find it really difficult to read the above paragraph and say it doesn't sound reasonable.  Because honestly, it does. To me at least. 
I'm going to tell everybody this right now:  the only way this is going to move forward is if there's a compromise. And that's exactly what's going to happen eventually. Mark my words. At some point, there's going to be a compromise, and everyone's going to be cheering in relief. Some people are going to be pissed. But the majority of people will be happy with it. 
I think it would benefit everybody if we would start moving towards that mentality right now, rather than four years from now when nobody gives a shit about bitcoin anymore because it floundered for too long.
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:19:24
Appreciate the reply. Unfortunately it's starting to look (at least based on hashing power percentages) that a compromise is exactly what is going to have to happen. Because the desirable outcome doesn't look like it's going to occur. 
I think people are going to have to sit down and be nice to each other at some point here.  And make some compromises. Hoping that happens sooner than later.

By the way, you're the guy I was referring to in my previous post that is going to get all pissed off when this thing plays out the way it's going to play out.

I guess we just disagree then. There are not many people who are going to want to invest in something that's shown a decline in value consistently over the last year. So I don't see why you feel that bitcoin as an investment is going to be the bubble-maker. 
Consumer adoption is what's going to fuel future pricing creases. That's going to create ongoing increases in value. And then… And only then… Will people start to believe the bit coin may be a good long-term investment. At least those outside of the current community who already know its potential.
Right now there is zero consumer incentive. So there's no consumer adoption. The creation of third-party services that create incentive is what's needed to fuel consumer adoption, and the next bubble. I'm personal friends with somebody who's running a bitcoin investment fund, and nobody wants to get on board.  Nobody. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean about using it as an investment.

Nevertheless, my response is still the same, and it is still the answer to your overall question. As time goes on, what a subdivision of Bitcoin can buy will become greater. That's why one whole Bitcoin will continue to increase in value. 
It's not going to take a lot of people to tap out the 14 million coins that will be available. Remember that 21 million isn't for 140 years. And the vast majority of that time, the coins aren't going to be dumping out. They're going to start trickling in 10 years or so. Creation slows down dramatically. While, hopefully, the need to acquire them will grow.
There's 7 billion people in the world. If widespread adoption occurs, The 14 million available coins over the next 5 to 10 years, will eventually be claimed. This means if it takes 5 BTC to buy a laptop today, it's going to take .005 BTC then. Because there's a limited supply. Let's not forget that some "millions" were lost in the early days forever as well.

Concensus shouldnt be only via core devs, but from the entire community, those building products and services, those with expertise in finance, and those out in the field trying to make this project a reality. 
Someone needs to build an official voting system on the block chain for ongoing code development votes and project priority-setting.    One that everybody votes on.  
Core devs *only* role should be to code what's requested, and act as advisors for what's technically impossible. They should not be making product development decisions.

Okay but this is the million dollar question. Why do they have to use the Bitcoin block chain? If the average consumer doesn't care about decentralization, and is perfectly fine with a company having its own security, why do they need a multiple gig blockchain backed by miners at all? Why can't each company have its own little Blockchain with its own "firewall" or whatever pathetic security they would put on top of it? 
Because that's how the entire world works now and it's working just fine. Just playing devils advocate here. I need to understand what's so mandatory about using Bitcoin's blockchain? I just don't see companies ever doing that. 
For size reasons. For the fact that they won't be controlling something that's a major element of their business. In fact that's the biggest factor. These companies aren't going to adopt something run by and reliant upon a bunch of pimply faced teenagers. Tell me why a company like IBM would care about bitcoins decentralization, mining, or security? Wouldn't they just go with another security method?

I have not posted here with another username.  Ever. I clicked your link on this app but it showed me a whole thread. I have no idea which username you meant.  Nor which post.  (EDIT::  SEE EDIT COMMENTS AT BOTTOM)
~~I've been participating on these forums and bitcointalk and the community in general for nearly 4 years. I've never posted under fake names or tried to deceive or trick anyone.~~
~~I'm going to get off my phone and get on my computer right now and try to find these posts you are referring to because using this app sucks. But I can tell you right now, whatever it is you think is happening, isn't.~~
~~If there's an identical post somewhere, then people are just fucking with me right now. Probably like this dude who impersonated my username.~~
EDIT:::  OK I see the post now. So you've concluded that because some dude copied and pasted what I wrote that I'm shilling under fake user names?  My first assumption is that the guy copied and pasted my post because he liked the content. 
The original post got over 25 upvotes.  I don't need to make a fake user name to "create the impression that people agree with me".  
Question:  if I wanted to say the same thing in two different threads, why wouldn't I just copy and paste it myself? 
Also, there's nothing in the post shilling anything. I was expressing genuine thoughts and opinions on a current topic. Just like you do. 
EDIT 2:::  Yeah I see the guy has only one "comment" on his account, and several "posts" about Europe and Trump. I don't live in Europe by the way. I don't know who this person is or what their goals are. 
Can the moderators see all the usernames tied to my account?  If so they can confirm I'm telling the truth. Or even match IP addresses.

I think you missed the point. We *want* industries to use the Bitcoin Blockchain. Isn't that a given?  Unless you're an alt coin fan, I don't understand your response.  I'm not saying altcoins don't exist.   
Allow me to explain.  I think a lot of people in the Bitcoin community (myself included) hoped and dreamed that Bitcoin was sufficient in its current form to meet the needs of major industries.  It is becoming more and more apparent that its not. There are some limitations and problems that need to be addressed, but have been put off on the back burner by the dev team as "not important for now".   
I have warned that industries will be evaluating Bitcoin *today* for viability in their business processes, and if it comes up lacking, they'll simply walk away, and make their own. Now this is happening. Im not suggesting we change bitcoin into something completely incomprehensible, but I think saying we'll address its most problematic limitations "in 5 years when we need it" (Gavin quote).. is poor judgment.  And it will result in Bitcoin itself being passed up as a useful tool for many industries.   Im assuming here that nobody wants that.  Maybe im wrong.

I spoke at length with a couple employees at a marijuana dispensary about bitcoin last month. Blown away that they still had no idea what it was. 
I told them straight up: "It's ideal for your industry. You don't need to deal with banks.  Nor armored trucks with bags of cash. Assuming a closed loop system is created and you can acquire everything with bitcoin".
Business idea: somebody create a closed loop system for the marijuana industry.
It can be fledgling. At first. But somebody go out there and create a system where dispensaries can get everything they need from A-Z with bitcoin. Then get a bitcoin ATM in their lobbies.  
Make it so they don't need to deal in cash. They can offer discounts for those willing to purchase with bitcoin. As it will save them millions of dollars to not have to deal with armored trucks and banks.
That's what's needed to get this thing going.  There will be no shortage of customers willing to spend their coins to purchase.

My mind keeps going back to those comments the Chinese miners made a couple years ago that they are not "technically inclined enough" to know or care about any of this drama. 
This is why these single individual points of failure need to be broken up. This is why bitcoin was supposed to be mined by everyone. 
There's got to be some way that we can shatter this centralized Mining bullshit. 
Decisions like these are supposed to be made by millions of people. Not five people.  When you've got a handful of people making these decisions, and they don't give a fuck, they're going to control everything - even by making no decision.

@_date: 2014-08-11 07:09:16
Exactly, so repeating the original question: why would any financial entity of any type care about using Bitcoin? They don't care about decentralization nor any of these political ideologies. Yet Bitcoin brings benefits that they don't currently have. So why wouldn't they all just make their own coin? If we are all assuming that one day, financial systems of all types will incorporate Bitcoin. (Unless you are of the belief that they can't coexist).  
I guess I just see this as one of Bitcoins potential weaknesses. It's great for those who give a shit about certain beliefs. But the industry we are trying to change, doesn't give a shit about those things. They will however give a shit about moving money around the world free of charge.
@_date: 2017-02-04 06:25:35
On the plus side, the "Bitcoin Core consensus ruleset" does not equate to the whole entity known as "Bitcoin".  It is a subset/element of Bitcoin.  Therefore they not only did not say they're going to "kill bitcoin" but what they plan to do won't "kill bitcoin" either.

Besides, as a general rule, you don't "do things when they're needed". You do them before they're needed. We have to create a product that's ready now, for the innovation that's coming in 1 year. Whether it's Gavin's solution or anyone else's.
Of course we need to be careful and do it right, but we also need to realize that the infrastructure has been waiting 2 years already. 
How many entrepreneurs, business owners and people with deep pockets have already discussed and canned the idea of doing something with bitcoin because of its limitations?  Where would we be today if this product was ready to go during the first bubble when the world was inspired and paying attention?

Needed the numbers based on the other BTC balances.  
So if I did this right, basing on the Winklevoss estimate of bitcoin eventually hitting $30,000 per coin, you would need around 650 bitcoins ?
This would bring you $50k a month from 5% interest and 1 coin would need to be worth $32,812?

There was nothing stupid about what I wrote. 
You simply I didn't understand it. So allow me to dumb it down for you: 
I've been hearing for the last 4 years that there's no rush to increase the block size, feature set, or speed of bitcoin. Same shit the idiots were telling Gavin when he was trying to tell you that time is of the essence back in 2013. 
And in the meantime, like the previous poster said, we've missed out on massive opportunities in the financial industry. And there has been zero consumer adoption. Businesses came and went, and opted for other solutions.
Meanwhile, all the "brilliant" coders who've never owned a business or even taken a class on it in their entire lives, continued to tell everyone: "Relax. Everything's fine".   You know, those guys who come on Reddit and tell people they're dumb all the time? 
You know them. Grab a mirror. 
In fact, it was that low IQ nonsense that started this entire divide in the community. 
Everything wasn't fine. Industries were checking bitcoin out, and walking away. That was the point of the guy who posted above. And my frustrated "LOL"ing reflected that I've been hearing the same "head in the sand" idiocy for nearly 4 years.  
And much to your dismay, that statement is 1000 fucking percent accurate. Not a thing about it is inaccurate, or dumb.

There's some logic to your claim.  I was actually thinking the same thing when I read his post.  If someone claims to be a Christian but rejects one of the central tenets of the theology, then they simply are not a Christian.  
There is a definition for each religion, and certain aspects are not negotiable.  If someone wants to change one of the central tenets of Bitcoin, then they simply are not discussing Bitcoin anymore.

The "technology that nobody needs" is the bare-bones Bitcoin protocol. That's a harsh way of putting it. Better to phrase it "they have no use for it at this time". Services are exactly what increase adoption, and make the bare-bones protocol useful, interesting, and desirable to the consumer public. We need more services.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:32:33
What's confusing to me is that its scheduled for an entire year from now. We've been talking about this for 2 years or more. Why do we think we have the luxury to wait an entire year to get it implemented? The next year is going to be crucial for bitcoin's success or failure. Forget that. The last two years were crucial. This needs to be done now. 
In this case the development timeline should not be based on our current needs.  Or even our forecasted needs for 1 year from now. This product (Bitcoin) needs to be sold now, for *future* infrastructure.  It needs shorter block times *now*, to draw interest from the industry for products and services a *year from now*.  We shouldn't assume we're fine just because we "currently don't need shorter blocks". 
I realize it needs to be fully tested. So get more people on board, and let's get this thing implemented. Otherwise were looking at another whole year of industry movers and shakers saying bitcoin can't hang, because it's too limited. Do we really have the luxury to allow another year of that? You've also got Ethereum coming out very soon. 
If there's one thing I've learned as a project manager over development projects, it's that you don't take your time on timelines. You shoot aggressively, and try your hardest to finish because there will *always* be delays. Shooting for a year from now means this thing may not go live until we're approaching 2017. We don't have that kind of time.

No.  I want to go to $20,000.  By actually seeing businesses use Bitcoin instead of being forced to bail to Ethereum and Ripple, because they found Bitcoin lacking. And by consumers actually giving a fuck that it even exists.
We could be at $10,000 right now in the current environment and it wouldn't matter to me, because we've still missed out on quadruple that value with the shitty decisions that have been made.  
The part you guys aren't grasping, is that our current value is so fucking undervalued that it's unspeakable. And this mentality for the last three years that we are "just fine the way we are" is exactly why.

I honestly don't think anything could happen that could kill Bitcoin at this stage.  With obvious exceptions.  At least nothing related to any of this.  There are just too many people financially invested in it, and even more people emotionally invested in it.  That builds a peculiar, automatic security for its longevity.  It would take me an hour to explain what I mean, but I have mulled this over for countless hours.  Even if the worst case scenario happened (as per your opinion of worst case) ... eventually something would materialize that at least keeps it alive.  People would work it out.  In other words - the way this thing is .... the chances everyone just gets up and walks away (and therefore makes it a failure) ... is pretty much zero.
So I'm not that worried.

This is interesting.   Can you expound on this a little more?  It seems to me that if this is true about fees, then Bitcoin is never going to see $40,000 per coin like many have estimated, long term.  
If the fees are $2.00 at $5,000..... they'd be $16.00 at $40,000. 
I never thought about fees being a mechanism by which the market would down-price Bitcoin.  This seems like a major problem.

Okay but he's concerned about it now, because it takes about a year to roll out the change. And by that time, the whole landscape out there in the field (with which you guys have absolutely zero interaction) could have already left Bitcoin behind due to its limitations.  
You guys are in tech. Even if you don't have any actual interaction with the people who you're building this product for. Even if their input is pretty much being ignored right now. You guys still know how quickly things change with technology. 
What's needed in a year, needs to be started today.  Or that which would've come in a year will never be built.  Because the visionaries today will see a platform that can't do what they want it to do.  
At least that's my take.

My personal opinion is that the block size issue is very important, but that everyone is forgetting the real issue:  nobody was using Bitcoin.  (please dont pick apart the word "nobody".  you know what I mean).  Block chain tech right now seems to be something businesses want, and Bitcoin is not feature-rich enough to support their needs.  
We never ended up finding Bitcoin's "killer app" that resulted in "incentive" for the average consumer to use it.   Remember everyone?   That's where we were before this block size issue rose up.  VC funding dried up, and we were all wondering if Bitcoin ever was going to see mass adoption.  
Its good we're addressing capacity issues before there are any massive capacity needs, but the fact that there **aren't** massive capacity needs is our biggest problem right now.  Once the block size issue gets figured out, we're going to end up right back where we were, wondering why the general public has no interest in Bitcoin, and if / when it will ever gain mass adoption.  
Meanwhile another coin (wont mention name) is going to eat Bitcoins lunch with business block chains because it actually has the features and extensibility that will allow the porting of business operations onto a block chain.  Bitcoin doesn't.  
I mention this issue repeatedly because I want to draw attention to it.  *Bitcoin has a knack for focusing on onramps, ease-of-use-, and capacity increases - - - - - rather than trying to come up with use-cases.  You can have all the onramps and capacity you want.  It wont matter if there aren't any usecases.*
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:11:23
Well it shows you that the $1000 price wasn't real. The only thing that makes the price organically rise is adoption. And there was no adoption back then. 
So I will always question that $1000 spike. I know everyone here says it wasn't Willy Bot, but I'm sticking with it being artificial in some capacity.

It was made so the masses could escape *centralized* governance by individuals and small groups. 
Nobody said that there aren't cascading effects to things. So I don't know what you're getting all huffy about.  
If literally everybody in the entire world stopped spending bitcoin or being interested in bitcoin because of some decision from the miners, that would be another form of governance. 
But per the white paper, governance was supposed to be hundreds/thousands/millions of miners deciding on how Bitcoin changes.  
Not a for profit company.  Not a group of developers.  And not a handful of Chinese guys running huge mining farms. 
I never said I agreed with it. I always thought it was a little bit strange that so much power was given to miners.  But I'm not here to change the white paper.  And the spirit behind it no doubt, was that miners would equal millions of individuals.

So then the title of this thread is completely misleading and false.  Somebody basically copied what took a dedicated group of people hundreds of hours to build while everyone here mocks the exact same set of code.  That makes total sense.  
Then they call it "vaporware" when in fact the "borrowed" Counterparty clone version isn't even live yet itself.  Got it. 
The real developers spent a ton of money and effort on attorneys, international jurisdiction issues, compliance, and assuring legality... and in turn Counterparty swipes the code and claims its a flourishing year-old product product when it's not.  Roger that.  
Impressive credit-taking for someone else's open source efforts and many others costs. 
Meanwhile the real Ethereum developers have continued to enhance the code in the last year. Have had hundreds of people attacking the network to test it and build even deeper security. You know… actually doing the work. Spending the time. Enhancing the product. 
But I suppose somebody can continue to swipe the free code, steal the latest version, and just keep bragging that they've got the most recent product ready and it's "pretend live".
It'll be interesting to see what the counterparty product looks like after the real Ethereum itself goes live and continues to be enhanced and developed-on. 
I suppose this is the pitfall of open source. You do all the work, and some other shady turds take credit for it while mocking you, implying that your product isn't ready yet, and theirs is.

He posted on Twitter today that his plan to lower the price, get more people into bitcoin, and spread the love is succeeding. Of course he could be pulling all of this out of his rear end. But we shall see Friday.

You made the statement that they are just doing this to be political. I'm not quite certain what you mean by that, but it sounded incorrect.
They aren't just blindly supporting their "political party". Like "I'm a Republican, therefore anything Republicans support, I support". 
There's no blind, petty stupidity going on here.
These people genuinely feel strongly about this issue for actual reasons. They strongly feel that we need more capacity for long-term growth. Now. Because there are major companies that have come and gone that wanted to use bitcoin, but couldn't.
Those companies needed vastly larger scaling then just 2 MB. So there's a huge amount of opportunity cost here. A huge amount of lost adoption already.
Minimizing all of that to just saying "oh they're just being political"… I would say therefore is wrong.

So basically Bitcoin is useless for sending money to people overseas?
Got it.
I bet that will come as a shock to everyone here.  
Since you can't pay every bill with Bitcoin, contractors want to cash out to USD.  We are not yet in that utopian world where Bitcoin has its own universe and no USD is required.  
Its quite a sobering thought to realize that Bitcoin will never be an acceptable way to send fiat funds overseas.  And that it will always be cheaper through banks.

I haven't read the other responses yet, but aren't you forgetting the fact that the more people who use the block chain, the higher the value will go for the unit of account? This isn't an issue of "will they feel like using the block chain, or will they feel like also using bitcoin". If they're going to use the block chain, by default, the value of bitcoin has to rise. Supply and demand is the factor controlling this. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:29:57
Hold on a second. This doesn't make any sense to my feeble tiny mind. Why would insiders sell their coins? Why wouldn't they just move them somewhere else? 
Doesn't it seem far more likely that the people doing the hacking were just cashing out? Wouldn't a $5 million cashout cause the price drop we saw? Everyones so into paranoid conspiracy theories here, they go for that approach first. 
Insiders wouldn't bail from the coin entirely. They'd  simply get out of Bitstamp.

People who have absolutely nothing to say on a topic except negative, are trolling. By definition. Why?  Because nothing is so absolute. Trolls require an irrational denial of reality to troll, or they'd have to concede to valid points now and then. Those who never do, are denying reality, and therefore trolling. Real people discuss topics usually with a modicum of tempered give and take. Trolls plug their ears, roll back their eyes, and type endless denials.

Of course it's not perfect, but without it, we currently have an ecosystem where I literally ignore every single new Bitcoin business because I now assume they're running some scam and I don't want to risk it.  I stick with Coinbase despite their user agreement. Why?  Because I trust them. That's sad.

As much as I agree with you, I have to be the bearer of bad news. Turns out, when you integrate PayPal, it comes with an automatic "what is PayPal?" Blurb/link. When you integrate bitcoin (through BitPay's  extension for example) they don't have that functionality yet. It just shows up as "Bitcoin". So this is actually an example of bitcoin e-commerce integrations being inferior in a tiny tiny way. It's still early days though.

The whole "inverted cross" complaint with the symbol is not something you should just ignore. A couple hundred million people in the world are going to have a shit fit if that symbol is chosen. 
You have to be a complete idiot at the basics of marketing to not realize how bad of a move it would be to pick a symbol that is going to offend an entire religion. Especially given their major fear of a "one world currency" powered by the *anti* ...*christ* (inverted cross). 
Fascinates me that everyone wants it on the bottom. You could instead *endear* hundreds of millions of people to it if you put it on the top. Or just don't change it in the first place.

No. Any element of the value that is affected by manipulation is (by very definition) not "Organic". To try and include it, makes it no longer organic. The purpose of differentiating in the first place, is to clarify "what would be the value" if nobody was manipulating it at all.

One thousand percent agree with you.  This picture has always made me cringe.  But let me explain why:  I get the humor, but purely as a "joke between us" .... it should never be an outward-facing ad of any kind.  
This is a finance tool.  Its a very serious, grown up, adult thing and the industry we want to disrupt consists of very serious, grown up people who have very serious concerns about the power, corruptibility, and importance of money.  
Bitcoin already suffers from being considered a "joke".   I find it really unintelligent to have as one of our staple images, something that shows us mocking ourselves as techie/sci fi/ D&amp;D nerds with useless tokens.  Even though we know its just a joke.
(i swear im not the guy who takes things too seriously - EVER)
Even yBitcoin magazine which I never shut up about because of its awesomeness, has taken a cartoonish approach in a few of its covers, and even ads inside, and that concerns me.

Because this topic is about paying a contractor who wants USD.  You can't pay every single bill with Bitcoin, so we still have to cash out to USD, unless he's going to blow $8,000 on an XBox and some rice cookers from Overstock.

You got to be fucking kidding me. Andreas has done more to single-handedly increase awareness and positive viewpoints on Bitcoin than any core developer ever could.  And you call people morons for appreciating that. In a single afternoon, he got the word out to over 300,000 people on the Joe Rogan podcast, with accurate information, and a positive viewpoint.  Obviously we all appreciate the core developers. But it's hardly stupid for people to appreciate someone who's out in the field correcting misinformation, and pouring every minute of this day into spreading awareness. You can code shit until you're blue in the face. Nobody's going to use it unless they know about it. Someone has to sell it to a real world marketplace or it's going nowhere. Pretty sure if Greg Maxwell (or me for that matter) was on the chair in front of the Canadian Senate, things wouldn't have gone as well. No offense to Greg. But it's clear you're a coder who thinks worshiping coders is the most important thing. The last thing you want is a programmer out there proselytizing this protocol to laypeople.

Aren't there time stamps on posts here?  I know for a fact I wrote that post.  So I know for a fact mine was up earlier than his.
Besides, would a time stamp even matter to you?  If I wrote it first, then you'd say I logged into my fake account to repost it.  (which makes no sense).
If he wrote it first, then you'd say I logged into my real account to copy it (which also makes no sense).
You're insane.

PS:  between the two posts, nearly 50 upvotes from nearly 50 people agreeing with what was written.  That's probably what you're really pissed about.  I bet those are all fake accounts too .... right
Here's my suggestion to you:  Rather than obsessing that people actually disagree with you and desperately trying to create imaginary scenarios in your head to discount it, focus on the hashing power battle going on between clients right now.  In the end, those numbers are the only ones which matter, because those are the numbers which prove the real sentiment of the community. My opinion means nothing.

You must be new here....
The absolutely insane vitriol, grasping at straws to discredit, and the personal attacks on the intelligence of those involved in bitcoin has been commonplace almost ***weekly*** since as far back as I've been involved (2012).  
Not to mention the experiences we've all had in personal settings like the mocking at family events, constant snide comments from friends on Facebook or smirking and head shaking at dinners with business partners.  
The media has been relentless in its constant barrage of misinformation. Taking massive leaps of logic and breaking rules of common sense just to discredit Bitcoin any chance they get.  Its so common that it has practically become a "sport" for them.  Legitimacy and acknowledgement from media sources is a huge leap forward for Bitcoin anytime it happens ***because*** of how insane the witch hunt has gotten. 
And the desire to give a hearty "fuck you" to pretty much everyone is likely a global sensation in the Bitcoin space at this point.

Please everyone. Stop quoting Satoshi.  He and everything he said, are clearly irrelevant to many here.  :(   Including that silly thing about the miners making the decisions.
@_date: 2017-02-11 04:36:20


Wouldn't this be a lot more attainable if we found a way to dismantle all these pools and mining Farms? Maybe by putting limits on things (I have no idea). 
I truly believe this is the source of literally all of our problems in Bitcoin. The fact that one individual can make a decision via generating a huge percentage of the hash power. And therefore has a massive vote. 
I don't believe that was intended, even though Satoshi referenced the possibility of future mining Farms. Maybe he thought we would come up with a solution to prevent single individuals from having so much influence. 
There's got to be a way to get the voting process back to a large network of millions of individuals.  
I know pool participants can opt to go to other pools.  And in that sense, it could maybe be claimed that they're "casting a vote". But the larger the pool, the more incentive they have to stay. So it doesn't seem like a proper way to vote.

Your one and only criteria for bailing on bitcoin should have been: when you see the infrastructure system beginning to fail. 
Not a second beforehand. The market price doesn't mean jack shit. 
The true indicator of the potential success or failure of bitcoin in the future is the infrastructure growth. When I start to see that falling apart, that's when I jump ship. And I'm seeing the very opposite. Quite honestly, this seems so obvious I'm shocked I even have to type it.

NASDAQ, Fidelity, Byrnes stock system, etc (who have now all bailed on Bitcoin).  I'm sure there are better examples so please don't harp on this portion of my question.  
Also known as "building a product for the customer base that's actually wanting to use it"

There is nothing inherently "holy" about this conference that we should blindly support it no matter what.  Just because the coordinator slaps "Miami" and "International" and "Bitcoin" on the title, doesn't mean its liked or wanted by the Bitcoin community in Miami.  Conferences are founded and run by individuals seeking to earn a personal profit.  In this case, there's a significant element of notoriety being sought by the founder as well.  Most of the Miami bitcoin community has clashed with Moe Levine in the past.  I saw his pompous, arrogant responses on the FB page after last years conference disaster, and that was enough to dissuade me from supporting his efforts.  This just adds more fuel to an already burning fire.

You don't realize that this is a completely blank slate industry?  No infrastructure exists.  Yet you complain that because it's not a fully mature industry already, it's sure to fail in the future. That logic doesn't make any sense.  Maybe with a company that's 6 years old.  Not with a protocol akin to the Internet which itself took 20 years to give us Amazon.com. 
I've engaged guys like you countless times on this topic. It's like you can't see past today. You ignore everything that's in the works. And you only look at past and current status. 
That doesn't make any sense to me, in an industry that has never existed before. You can't just ignore everything going on out there in the innovation and infrastructure space, and unlike you have implied, there's no indication any of that is slowing down or stopping. 
Therefore even if the price goes to five dollars, that doesn't change the thousands of entrepreneurs who want to make a buck off this new technology, who are going to create business models and use-cases to do just that. 
They don't make money off the market price. They make money off of transactions. Therefore the market price is irrelevant. Except for companies directly tied to it like cloud mining or investment funds. The potential for making money off Bitcoin transactions has not changed. Period.

I think it's going to be a 5 to 10 year mentality change for the general public. Eventually it's going to be a "thing" to just have your "online cash". 
For convenience. For the purpose of avoiding credit card fraud when you purchase online. For tons of other perks that will likely be coming via companies offering them.  (Currently you can get discounts etc). 
In the future it probably won't be a big deal to just grab a couple tokens, and have them in your online / mobile wallet. For those purchases you wish to be anonymous, or secure.  
It's got to be a mentality change though. And things like that slowly saturate the market usually.

There's still that whole "everybody's using them" thing that businesses will probably look at though. 
There's a lot to be said for that ongoing, organic growth and usage. Name recognition. Yes ...network effect. These things really are powerful. 
I was one of the few people on this sub that constantly asked "why would businesses use bitcoin when they could make their own block chain and take advantage of all the savings, without the negatives?" 
I still to this day don't fully understand the answer. Something about lack of security without a network of miners. I'm still not sure that's mandatory though. Security is security. And I'm pretty sure that businesses are capable of setting up a secure environment for their block chain without needing warehouses in China with bunkbeds, to do it. 
I don't know. Part of me worries that Bitcoin will end up just like bit torrent. It's free, decentralized, and fully available if you want to use it. But very few people actually do. 
Let me just say this though, the whole network effect, name recognition, and simply "being comfortable with it because it's been around so long, and so many companies are building on top of it"… thing... really should be sufficient to make bitcoin itself a relevant thing in the future.

There's something inherently different about network effect with bitcoin, versus network effect with say, MySpace.  Maybe it has to do with how deep the roots have to go, to get it off the ground. 
All you needed for MySpace was a dude that knew how to make a website. And some other dude that knew how to make a website and was better at connecting people, won.  There's a million miles difference between that and whats required to duplicate the current Bitcoin ecosystem, which spans multiple industries, multiple countries, services, and participants. 
For something to surpass bitcoin, it doesn't just need a new block chain with a couple extra features. You also have to recreate a whole new world of infrastructure.  That's why comparing bitcoin to MySpace just doesn't work.  It simply isn't that easy to recreate this wheel. The *whole* wheel.  The block chain and the protocol are 10% of the equation when it comes to eventual widespread use. 
That's why the network effect of bitcoin is a powerful guarantee that it will be around as the dominant player, for a long time. And that's why great innovations like Ethereum have a huge mountain to climb. 
Just because you make something, doesn't mean it ends up getting used.

I'm fascinated how excited you are by those comments.  So completely pulling shit directly out of his ass about Amazon and Walmart to hype up the coin and draw gullible people in means nothing to you?  Do you *really* believe he's just under a gag order from Amazon.com?   
You might want to familiarize yourself with how scammers work.  Especially those with an IQ over twelve.  They say things that can't be proven untrue, while still completely lying.  This is scamming 101.  Yet you're soooooooo impressed by the premise that his claims can't be disproven in a court of law, ahead of time, before anything has even happened, and before its even physically possible to disprove something?
Auroracoin scammed everyone into the pump and dump by claiming the Icelandic government was on board with it too.  Could you PROVE ahead of time that this wasn't true, without a contact in the Icelandic government?  No.   Was it true?  No.  Your entire premise is faulty.
Unfortunately sometimes you cant *know* or *prove*.  But what you can do is look at a guys long history of scamming people and companies and colleagues.  At that point you'd basically have to be a total idiot to do business with the person.  Yet here you are.  
You probably should go blow $100,000 on Paycoin.  Put your money where your mouth is, and prove that you have 100% faith in Paycoin because nobody can provide proof of any wrongdoing.  You will be expected to provide proof of purchase.  Otherwise you probably shouldn't be calling anyone out like this.

I take it you're 20 years old, and weren't around when the Internet started? 
I was. You should've seen the train wreck involved in just trying to get online back then. And how many *decades* it took for us just to get to Google existing.  And Amazon.com. 
You are that guy from 1991 who probably would've said the Internet sucks, and will go nowhere.
I used to have to drive to Walmart and buy a compact disc in an envelope, just to get online. 
I got cut off anytime my call waiting beeped.... because my 2400 baud modem... was using my phone line... and scratchy sound tones... to keep me connected.  **I had to pay $9.95 an hour** just to stay on the Internet. 
I was the only one I knew with a computer. Nobody else gave a shit. There was no widespread adoption. And nobody had any use for computers. 
Just loading a black and white pixelated image took 5 minutes back then.
I can just picture you saying:
"Nobody's ever going to use this shit. That image loads too slow. You're paying too much to get online. There will never be widespread adoption for this!"

My opinion:  The Bitcoin Market is currently no indicator of the "health" of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Its currently a completely separate universe from whats going on "out there".  Right now its primarily manipulators, whales, day traders, and speculators.  Period.  Eventually, when someone figures out consumer incentive, commerce and organic demand will begin to push the price up.  
Until then, I wish news outlets would refrain from commenting on the health of Bitcoin based on market price changes.

Because changes like these aren't organic declines, reflecting an unhealthy economy.  These are extreme swings on a small pool that causes big waves.  This implies continued whale movement.  And whale movement - just like most of the bitcoin Market world, has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself, its potential for success, or the health of the ecosystem.  You have to remember this entire "market" thing is a bunch of day traders, manipulators, speculators, and whales trying to make a buck off the highs and lows.  Meanwhile, out in the real world, Bitcoins true ecosystem is being birthed and nutured and grown.  One day the effects of those activities will spawn true consumer adoption and organic demand for BTC.  And thats when the bitcoin price will actually have meaning for the first time.

Cute name.  I'm flattered.  And no. You're the one that missed the point. Allow me to explain something:
A lot of demand is required for massive price increases.  There's a hell of a lot more enthusiasm going around when you can buy 1000 of something, versus when you can buy only .0001 of something. 
That psychology is exactly why it's a lot easier to get the necessary demand to go from $1 to $10, than it is to go from $1000 to $10,000. 
If you don't think individual units play a role in the human psychology of situations like these, then you're missing an important part of my point.
No. I'm not stupid enough to think they have to buy a whole coin.  That's not the point. This is a little more complex than that.

John Ratcliff on the Lightning Network:
"We all want bitcoin to grow and more people to use it. Lightning Network helps because it moves [smaller, higher volume] transactions off the main chain to this alternate payment system.  That's phenomenal.  Plus it [creates] new types of transactions that aren't even possible today.  The current Bitcoin network capacity is so small that a relatively few number of people worldwide can have access to it.  
The main thing that makes the Lightning Network so awesome is that it *requires* the Bitcoin network.  You can open a Coinbase account and NEVER do a Bitcoin transaction.  Ever.  You can open a Coinbase account right now.  You can buy and sell things all over the internet.  And you'll never have done a single on-chain transaction. The Lightning Network lets you do all these little "side-transactions", but it is 100% always based on a *confirmed transaction on the Bitcoin Network*.  And when you close the channel, its [back] on the Bitcoin network.  It is bound to the Bitcoin network.  That's the beauty of it.  
That means that we are limited in users.  So if the Lightning Network can do billions of transactions (when in fact it can) it can only do those billions of transactions for about 2 Million people.  Because the current 1MB blocksize limit at 3 transactions per second, 2 million people can do about 2 transaction a month.  Lightning Network transactions require on-chain transactions.  But on-chain transactions are gated, and we can only support so many.  
Its remarkable to me that there's all this media hype, and in reality so few people actually use Bitcoin.  On the giant echo-chamber of Reddit, there's probably a thousand to two-thousand who check that damn thing every day of the week, and have arguments.   On the slack channels, there's maybe a dozen of the same cast of characters.  We actually are a very small community in proportion to the media coverage.   
Most of us are super enthused and excited about Bitcoin because we want to see it go out to the world.  We want the whole world to know how awesome it is.  We want everyone in Venezuela... to not have their money debased by their government.  To escape capital controls and an oppressive government.  Obviously that [kind of effect] hasn't happened [yet] because we only have a handful of a few million people using Bitcoin.  
But if all of a sudden 50 million people wanted to use Bitcoin?  You can't.  And not with the Lightning Network either.  So ... my big thing... my vision for the future of Bitcoin is:  Lets move all these petty, low value transactions off to Layer 2.  Lets not clutter the bitcoin network with this stuff.  But we also need to support more people.  We need more people to come in.  Do we have that demand today?  2 Billion people who need to open payment channels today?  Probably not.  
But i sure want to have a growth plan that says: "We are not going to force people off to walled-gardens.  We are not going to force them to the Circles and Coinbases of the world. I want them to be able to hold their value on the Bitcoin Network. If they want to move their life savings [an example of a large transaction that wouldn't necessarily utilize the Lightning Network], I want them to be able to do an on-chain transaction.  I want more than a million or two people to be able to do that."  
And the block size is going to have to grow if we ever want to see Bitcoin used by more people.  If it doesn't grow, then its only going to be used by a relatively small number of people who will be very wealthy.  There will be banks and financial institutions, and everybody else will move to an alt coin or some centralized service".

But this is about a bigger issue. We are all used to paying a $1-2 dollar flat fee at an ATM. And it's free if it's your own bank. When new users are looking at $10, $20, $30 fees just to get bitcoin, you're going to have a bunch of new adoptees saying "forget it". 
But that's the point. You don't care about that.  This is a business opportunity for you. Your goal is to make money. So you charge irrational fees because you can get away with it via people who are desperate to stay off the grid. The fact that this completely eliminates any new adoptees, is pretty much irrelevant to you. Obviously.
In the other thread a guy in New York City bragged he's making $270,000 a *month* off two BTMs.  So it's not like you couldn't stand to lower your fees...
At the very most you should be charging the equivalent of the supposedly "inferior and far more expensive" banking system ATM: a $1-2 flat fee per transaction. You won't get rich. Very few people get rich off ATMs. There's a reason for that. Nobody's willing to pay fucking ridiculous fees to get their own money out.
But as it stands right now, you've made a superior, nearly free technology 10x more expensive to acquire and transact with than fiat.  You've made bitcoin suck in comparison to the banking system. Thereby nullifying its benefits, its reputation, and it's entire reason for being.

Why is there a Bitcoin symbol at the top of the page with an inverted cross embedded in it?   You folks new to basic marketing concepts?  
There's about 1 billion people in this world who are going to take offense to that symbol.  Irrational or not, its going to happen.  Put the line somewhere else.  Hell, put it at the top, so they think its an actual cross.  Putting it at the bottom is a downright dumb idea.

Pointing out that there are more drone strikes is kind of ridiculous. There are more drone strikes because of the very fact that Obama doesn't support actual combat and casualties. Think of all the lives that have been saved simply because drones are being used. I'm pretty confident that's his thinking.  Blindly saying "there are more drone strikes now" is intentionally ignoring the reason why. 
I often wonder how much of what Obama is doing is a result of the Republican party pressuring him to. To avoid impeachment or some other insane behavior from the Republican Party, I'm sure he felt he needed to do at least something.   And because he actually is opposed to war/death, to appease the freaks and war mongers, drone strikes were decided upon instead of boots on the ground.

Yes.  I run an online store. One day I called my merchant processor and asked why my fees didn't seem to be that 2% they kept bragging about. She went in and looked. She saw that a large percent of my orders were coming from overseas, and airline rewards cards. She told me in those cases, with one particular card, it got up to 10% for the transaction. Most of them were between 4% and 8%. So yes it turns out I'm buying airline miles for people.

Sometimes people can direct you to quotes by using links. Surprise, smart ass. 
Whether he got "it" wrong or not, the sentiment is what I was referring to. And you can't argue with that. He clearly has no opposition to it scaling to Visa level proportions. And that's the point of the quote. 
The founder, the creator, the Lord of all has stated very clearly that he foresaw on-chain transactions scaling to Visa level proportions. 
He may have "gotten it wrong" on how we get there, or when we get there, and you may completely disagree with his opinion.  But that doesn't negate the fact that he clearly had no objections to it.  In fact that quote clearly conveys his *DESIRE* for on-chain transactions to scale to that level and that the main chain *IS* the transaction layer. 
The question then becomes only this:  **Do you think Satoshi's vision was bad and should be changed?** If yes, then state that as your position. But let's not walk around pretending like Mow (and several others) that this topic wasn't clearly defined by Satoshi already. 
Now I can already tell by your charming personality that you're just going to find exceptions with everything, so I'm going to save myself the unnecessary blood pressure spikes and not even engage you past this point. You know exactly what I'm saying by pointing to that quote (via a link), and you know my conclusion is accurate based upon it. Therefore my point has been made.

And to think, the fact that all we could really do is buy coffee with bitcoin, (and almost nobody was doing even that) was actually viewed as its biggest risk to success until we got distracted by the block size issue. 
So while the rest of you are arguing about block size, I'm still over here worried about the fact that there's literally no incentive for consumers to use it in the first place. 
The only usecase I saw was in corporations who wanted to convert their systems to a block chain, and we successfully middle-fingered that whole industry with our dislike of men in suits. 
If you're really worried about the success of bitcoin, I think someone better figure out the "reason to use it in the first place" problem.  It's still sitting right there.  Waiting for people to come back and remember it.

Wouldn't even know how to find it at this point. I think with Facebook you have to scroll down. Wait. Scroll down more. Wait. It would probably take me 10 years to go back a full year.  I can inquire with the individual he was engaging with about the details. It related to the execution of the conference.
I'm extremely opposed to telling stories like this without the actual content in front of me. So just a disclaimer. This is just the vibe I picked up on from a conversation I was eavesdropping on, over a year ago. This is what I walked away with. Accuracy be damned, but I'm doing my best to keep it real. 
I was informed that the Miami conference really isn't a conference run by the bitcoin community in Miami. It's run by Moe Levine, who I guess runs conferences in multiple cities across the country. He's got a franchise he's trying to promote. 
The Miami conference last year had a lot of problems in the execution and planning department. When the finger-pointing started, it got kind of messy. He was blaming people down here in Miami for being incompetent, and tarnishing his reputation. While ppl here thought he failed to do his job as the Founder.  I don't remember the details, but I know people who I respect highly in the bitcoin community here were pretty upset.  And I know his responses were akin to a middle finger to everyone down here. Condescending, arrogant, and very self-serving. 
Obviously there are two sides to every story. So if you're bored, join the Miami international bitcoin page on Facebook, and scroll down for seven hours, you may run into the conversation last year. It was on that wall.  I think it was his tone, his vulgarity, and his outright pompous attitude that made me think: "Fuck this guy". And that has stuck with me since.

I've been thinking a lot about this also. I think there is a lot more anger and frustration about the Gox /Neo situation, and the effect it has had on the public opinion, than much of us realize. 
I think a lot of people here have begun to understand the damaging effects these events have had on the general public's understanding, and willingness to embrace this new technology. And it's a source of anger and frustration for all of us. So I think maybe the decibel level has been turned up significantly, upon discovery of a new "potentially reputation-damaging scheme" like PayCoin. 
I think people are more protective, and more vocal. And in a sense, this could be a good thing. We just have to make sure it doesn't turn into a witch-hunt on the wrong groups.

He's just going to go in there and do whatever he wants, violating their terms of service, rules, etc. He's going to enable payments, try to jimmy rig each system to work, and most likely get banned from each, one by one.

You can't replace the remittances market unless you've got brick-and-mortar cash out locations. Western Union has cornered the market on that. It would take decades to set up the number of contracts they have with 7-Eleven's all around the world, even in the farthest villages of Thailand.

At the end of the day, what matters is network effect. The first comer.  Counterparty already has a head start with that. If Ethereum wasn't still poking around unreleased, they would have solidified their spot as the first comer, and built some network effect before they were copied. Just like Bitcoin. But as it stands, they still haven't even "gone live". A year later.

And this time remember, bitcoin is a long-term hold. Minimum 10 years.

A guy who declared two years ago that [Bitcoin will hit $2000 by Thanksgiving]( considers himself an intelligent critic on what's in store for Bitcoin's uncertain future? 
Back then, while you were declaring that bitcoin was about to go "moon", I was posting concerns that interest, investments, and marketability may be lost due to development that was moving too slowly.  That we were losing ground to keep this product competitive in the marketplace, and ahead of the curve so that Bitcoin would be the chosen block chain instead of alternate implementations.  
That premise has proven 100% true as the avalanche of VC funding stopped on a dime and never resurfaced, and a myriad of industry players have bailed from considering this block chain for their products and services to the consumer public. 
Therefore not only did I come close, but I nailed it directly to the wall, two years ago. 
I realize your definition of "coming close" probably centers around who sounds the smartest in their long-winded, technical talk here on Reddit.  But I came close in a completely different way. We are moving too slowly, and opportunities have been lost that would have been very valuable.  This is an indisputable fact.
I'm still looking for someone on your side that has intelligence regarding how products are brought to market successfully, how important timelines are, and who should be deciding what gets coded and when. Knowing "code" and cryptography does not equate to being an intelligent critic on this issue.

Actually I disagree. I've spent the last three weeks working on stores, integrating the BitPay extension into magento. It's straight forward. And 80% of the things he complains about above, are not really an issue at all. Customers can't pay twice accidentally. They can't pay less accidentally. It's not time-consuming at all. Took me about five minutes to get set up.  I don't know where he's getting some of this. There is a redirect to call back to the store. Maybe he should not use Coinbase and just use BitPay. 
There have been no issues with the refunds, there's no such thing as a missed payment. I'm not even sure what that how that would happen. Some of these things are just limitations with bitcoin in general. Offering a discount through magento was very simple. You set up a rule in magento and you're done. We've had ours running for a month now no problem.  Refunds?  Well that's a Bitcoin issue.  You cash out immediately to fiat, you're going to have to send them bitcoin yourself.  I don't see how much of this is worthy of mention. Seems obvious. 
Edit:  I see further down that the OP has clarified this is only an issue with the Coinbase e-commerce plug-in. That should've been in the title. Is this is not a Bitcoin problem, a sign that "Bitcoin for merchants is still in its infancy" nor a generalized "Bitcoin merchant processing problem". Theyre Coinbase plugin problems.

It's not an oxymoron if you genuinely feel that bitcoin was intended to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system without the need for centralized third parties, which also can facilitate a Layer 2 financial industry for additional flexibility and functionalities.  
It's only an oxymoron if you believe Bitcoin was intended to be *only* a Layer 2 system with a limited backbone that does not act as peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system in itself.  The former came from the horses mouth. The latter seems to be a change in viewpoints made sometime in the last two years.  
A genuine peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system without 3rd parties would need significantly more than 2MB blocks.

Pools just started the voting process (and thank goodness for that - at least now thousands of individual miners can "vote" as Satoshi intended).  And they're reporting significant votes in one particular direction.  If pools begin to follow this voting policy across the board, the % will change.  
Plus, only as of yesterday have the original 5 Chinese miners been exposed to the alternate viewpoint.  Prior to this they had no opinion, followed by 1 viewpoint which they shrugged their shoulders and accepted.  I'd say it's definitely not over.

The phrase "grow the economy" has a couple different definitions. You are only acknowledging one of them. 
The other valid definition, is actual growth. Adoption. Widespread use. 
The real problem is there's no incentive for mass adoption. But if there was, businesses willing to accept it would be a mandatory foundation to facilitate that.  
And you better fucking believe the Bitcoin economy would "grow" a shit ton larger if hundreds of thousands of people had incentive to purchase and transact with it... than it would if this tiny microcosm of people just hoarded it.

Think.   Really .... really think hard about this one.
"Hi everyone - got a request from the CIA to meet!"
"Hi everyone - just met with the CIA!!!!
That's what happened.   Both of those announcements from Gavin.   Chronologically.
You know what that sounds like to me?

I tried to import my paper wallet into blockchain.info, and it literally disappeared. After the import, the page just refreshed, and my balance was zero. It told me it successfully imported, but there were no coins in the address at all. I freaked out.
I frantically emailed support, and sat there for an hour convinced that my money was gone.  But thankfully an hour or two later I checked the old paper wallet address and the balance was still there. Another failed sync despite the site saying successful, and 0.00 BTC.  Support never responded to my emails. I will never risk my money on that site again.

People actually do have concerns sometimes. Without being trolls. Development has moved painfully slow in the bitcoin space. So issues are raised when things look like they're not being fixed. Our development cycle is unbelievably slow. That's been a significant part of this. 
It's nobody's fault really. There's been a lack of funding, reliance on volunteers, and apparently a lot of wasted time with arguing on the mailing list among devs.  But I wouldn't call people who express concerns about the weaknesses and problems, trolls.

Once again, it's no mystery why the price is hovering only $230. Because business adoption has not increased consumer demand yet. This is all infrastructure being built. It's not some confusing "oh my gosh, NASDAQ has embraced Bitcoin but the price is going nowhere!" dilemma. 
You are talking about 100% pure speculator activity. People who react to news. That isnt adoption. And if they don't react, the price isn't going to move. 
This isn't some mystery. If the action taken does not directly and currently increase organic consumer demand for coins, the price doesn't go up. Doesn't mean that somehow this is a "new unexpected development" for Bitcoin the currency. It just means it's not the type of news that makes demand outstrip supply… Yet.  We are all waiting for either businesses or consumers to hop on the train.

A year and a half ago I asked everybody to start banding together to develop commercials, marketing, advertising, get the public understanding what Bitcoin is, what it's value has, etc. 
The response I got here? A bunch of people telling me it was a stupid idea. Someone actually said nobody watches TV anymore.
The idea here is to make people aware of it. Describe what it is. Have a family - expressing relief that they no longer have to be treated like shit by their bank. Have a guy make a purchase and feel confident his financial information wasn't just stolen. That's what PSA's are for. To say bitcoin isn't ready for that? 
There are also a lot of companies in the space with a lot of money right now. We are pushing 700 million in VC funding.  There is no shortage of players who would be willing to help finance some PSA's.  It will benefit everyone.  Between that and a Lighthouse campaign I think we can do it. 
Unfortunately I have zero skills related to any of this. I just hate seeing massive opportunities, and nobody doing anything. So if I need to be a cheerleader with pom-poms then that's the role I will play. If "swiftboat" can put up commercials every single year there's an election, we can do this for Bitcoin.

I have explicitly asked the lead BU devs if they would go along with it, and they said unequivocally yes.  That doesn't mean the people who are hardcore anti-blockstream will, but at least some of the people who have more level heads seem to just be hoping for an on-chain boost (greater than SegWit is providing).   As they've been asking for years.

You can't have massive value increase without widespread adoption.  So you're putting cart before the horse.   And that is exactly why I listed all those other things as "necessary" for Bitcoin to gain mass adoption.  
We had the opportunity to "woo" the business world but they're long gone.  Someone needs to make some killer apps and usecases that will incentivize the consumer public, or Bitcoin as it is today - is all that it will ever be.
@_date: 2016-03-16 07:32:32
Do you even have the first clue that the masses may look elsewhere if we're going to sit on our asses and do nothing while we "become more resilient"? 
Are you kidding me with this logic? We shouldn't bother making this product capable of mass adoption until we feel like it? Do you have an understanding that there's a whole world out there that's jumping on block chain right now? We don't have all the time in the world. 
This isn't trolling. It's not FUD.  And it's not manipulation or irrationality.  It's knowing products and markets rather than just hyper focusing on code.  The industry is moving forward without us.  I just can't figure out how you can not be aware of that. 
This is why programmers don't make product development decisions. They have no clue what the industry requires, nor what is necessary for a product to succeed and be competitive. All they know is code. And all they care about is making sure the code is good. Meanwhile the product is going to fail in the marketplace.

@_date: 2016-01-20 08:34:11
Aaaaand were back to calling everyone (except the core devs) idiots.  
In the real world it's the programmers who lack the education and knowledge of the industry / customer needs.  That's why there are managers and industry experts telling them what to do. They are expected to complete the task list they are given, and nothing more.  
In the real world, programmers act only as technical advisers on what is, and isn't possible. They are hardly the "smartest" when it comes to the end product. They are smart with code.  
Bitcoin is no different. You've got a bunch of guys who are coders, thinking they are smarter than everyone else when it comes to the end-product, the users, and the industry. But the users and the industry are screaming in opposition. So tell me again why everyone else is an idiot except the programmers. Because in the real world it's the very opposite.

You're a good writer.  
Is there any possible way we can do *anything* in the code which might forcibly break up mining into millions of pieces that can not be mined by any one individual, and would get us closer to, or all the way back to "one person one hashpower vote" ?   (Similarly aka "one CPU".  Or one GPU). 
Despite all the other topics of argument right now, this seems to be the single thing worthy of a drastic change.  Even if it runs a risk.  It just seems to be the foundation to all the current problems.  Because even the act of splitting mining up, ends up addressing quite a few of the other concerns on the table. Because it allows millions of people to vote individually again.

Here is the clip related to them meme above:
My takeaway from this:  they know that what they're building (block chain without Bitcoin) really isn't an innovation. It's going to improve the archaic banking system, but they readily admit they're just building a glorified distributed database. They're not introducing anything they haven't had for 25 years already.

Best thing people can do is contact yBitcoin magazine and request a box of their magazines and literally plant them all over their towns.

@_date: 2017-03-15 23:48:40
This is where I draw my comments from:  Me sitting here in 2013 screaming like a bitch that Bitcoin needs to expand and scale "now" for when its needed "later".  That was my mantra.  Over and over:  "Build now for what is going to be needed tomorrow".  And I got laughed at by everyone who was a dev.  
I swear I must have had 500 conversations about it back then, and the response was always the same:  "Relaxxxxxxxxxxxxxx".
That was 2013.
Then I remember getting into my car after leaving Publix on Biscayne Blvd in Miami, and turning on the LTB podcast.  This must have been late 2013.  Hearing Gavin expressing the most sincere, aggravated frustration that as more and more people hopped on the bitcoin dev bandwagon, the less they were getting done.  He spoke about complete and utter stagnancy in the development progress, and literal months of arguing on the mailing list instead.  
Disagreement.  And a lack of leadership among the dev team was leading to stagnancy.  It wasn't long after that, that Gavin and others started expressing dire concern for scaling.  The response they always got was:  "Relaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx".
I have watched this play out since June 2012 when I first started hearing about organizations and companies "wanting" to use Bitcoin but being unable to.  I felt like we were missing the boat on so many levels.  
Granted, my big thing was Layer 2 functionality.  I am first to admit that Andreas Antonopoulos has been championing Layer 2 for higher transaction volumes since well back to 2012.  And its from him that I understood the need for it.  
But it wasn't getting done.  Stagnancy.  Months, years rolled by... 
I remember the day the white paper for sidechains was announced.  Also I think an LTB podcast where Adam spoke.  Everyone was elated.  Why elated?  Because everyone in their right mind was stressing at the complete lack of forward progress in development.
How long did it take for Sidechains to actually become available?  Was it more than 2 solid years?
***You have to know that its back then, that Classic XT BU and these other alternatives were being first considered***
I have mentioned a few times that I was a Project Manager over development teams for about 15 years.  In that time I saw massive undertakings build from nothing, in a matter of months, because there was leadership, and guidance on deadlines and specifications.  If we had let the developers run the show entirely, they would have built insanely complex systems that weren't necessary, and they would've caused literally years of scope creep.  And I can't help but see parallels with Bitcoin.
I started to see the divide coming down the pipeline in 2013-ish.  The devs were like "Ehh were' fine leave us alone".  And the people who were more "business" oriented, wanting to build systems on top of bitcoin were the ones who were fighting with them..   Business versus Developers.  And that's exactly what has happened with the other sub, and this sub.  This one is primarily developers, and the other one is primarily those who want to build things that real humans will use.  
The developers ALWAYS had a shit attitude towards that group and cared nothing for their concerns.
It was the lack of forward progress and the absolute **apathy** to any concern that Bitcoin needed to evolve quickly, which lead to the inception of these "alternative clients". 
Yeah - maybe they suck.  Maybe they're not good programmers.  But when you force people to branch off and make alternate clients because the Core client doesn't give a rats ass about real-life Bitcoin use, that's what will happen.  That's why I wish the great developers could lose some ego and actually LISTEN to other people in this ecosystem!
I watched thread after thread, month after month get dismissed and shot down anyone tried to champion for Bitcoin "staying competitive" in the market it was trying to build for.  And months, years went by and nothing new happened in that department.  
The term stagnancy doesnt relate to a "lack of changelog activity".  It has to do with people screaming that Bitcoin needed to scale back in 2012 and its now 2017.  
This is as true, honest, and as genuine as I can recount my experience with all of this.  And its what powers my frustration today.  I truly believe that the root of this entire thing relates to lack of forward progress back in 2012, 2013, and forward.  I truly believe BU wouldn't even exist today if that hadn't occurred.

When there is no product manager that actually interfaces with the users of a product, prioritizes enhancements like these, and makes the coders implement them - they simply won't ever be done.

Are you seriously in denial dude?   Here's a New York Times article that just came out this week. Everyone needs to wake the fuck up and stop pretending that nothing is going on in the industry right now because of this problem.
"A new virtual gold rush is underway.
Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency — known as E***** — has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months.
Beyond the price spike, E****** is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0.
*The rise of the relatively new virtual currency has been helped by a battle within the Bitcoin community over how the basic Bitcoin software should develop.*
*The fights have slowed down Bitcoin transactions and led some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their businesses. Enter E*******."*
So me and everyone else in the real world is aware of what's going on, but you know that nothings happening and it's all just hunky-dory right?

This whole thing began because of things like the "fidelity effect". Bitcoin went from complete obscurity to suddenly having major corporations that wanted to make use of its block chain. 
And publicly declaring that they couldn't. 
Patrick Byrne who's been one of bitcoin's biggest supporters in the financial world, had to resort to another block chain to accomplish his own goals, which must have been very frustrating for him. NASDAQ was on board, then bailed. 
People started to realize that even though we are 7 years in, we couldnt handle the demand that was quickly springing up everywhere among *companies*.  
People who disagreed with this only pointed to the "coffee shop transaction" side of things. Claiming there still was no demand for Bitcoin and absolutely no concerns about us reaching capacity anytime soon. 
Others realized that consumers lacked incentive, but that businesses didn't.  And to ignore corporate demand for block chains equated to a major denial of reality.  In fact it probably moreso equated to the stewards of the code simply feeling Bitcoin shouldn't be used by corporations. And that their desire to use our block chain was worthy of ignoring.  A decision they made in a vaccuum much to the disagreement of the community. 
Turns out, Bitcoin's biggest usecase was among transaction-based businesses, and that surge in demand came and went.  That's when people started getting pissed off at the claim that there is no rush, and the lack of forward progress towards scalability solutions. 
These companies have now bailed from the Bitcoin idea, VC money into Bitcoin stopped flowing in (almost on a dime), and everyone's trying to build their own block chain instead, while we laugh and point at them for being dummies "who don't get it".

I'm no expert Theymos, but I got involved in Bitcoin *because* of its open source, open thought, freedom-based, uncensored, love of competition, and "may the best methodology win" mentality brought to the table.

I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here, but doesn't this directly conflict with what the white paper says, on how bitcoin is supposed to work at its most basic foundational layer? 
I mean everyone is screaming that BU is trying to destroy Bitcoin. Meanwhile BU is the only one adhering to what's in the white paper. 
While everyone else here calls Satoshi a shitty programmer who didn't know what he was talking about. Is out of touch with reality.  And the white paper is a novelty at best.
Doesn't that strike you guys a little bit weird?  
I never agreed with the white paper that miners should have so much power. 
But that's what the fuck is written in the white paper, and it's not my job to try and change the definition, or rewrite the rules. 
If I'm going to do that, I personally would tell myself to get my ass out of this coin and go to a different one.
If any of you guys are confused why there's a fight right now, this is why. It's not because some weird alternate implementation is trying to "destroy bitcoin". It's because that weird alternate implementation is actually reading the fucking white paper.
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:26:17
Nothing I said was misleading. I can't find the quotes now but those were their exact words. And they didn't qualify on chain or off chain. 
PLENTY of times the statement has been made that bitcoin is not supposed to be electronic peer to peer cash. That's why everyone's arguing right now.
I personally have responded to those comments by saying things like "what the actual fuck?" And "welcome to the fucking twilight zone". And got something like 30 upvotes for saying that. Because that's exactly the kind of shit that's flying around, and it doesn't make sense. It doesn't jive with the white paper at all.
I know what you're attempting to do, which is completely negate my original statement, but you have failed.

Bitcoin needs to be extensible on the layers above.  This type of thing is what we desperately need.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong here, but this is how Satoshi built Bitcoin.  The miners decide everything.  Mining was supposed to be you, me, and your grandma though.  Not 5 chinese dudes laying on dirty mattresses in warehouses in rural China.  But as per the white paper, miners are the ones who control Bitcoin.  Any deviation from that deviates from the white paper.  
And I will be 100% honest - the first time I read it, the first thing that popped into my head was:  "This is really not a good idea".   But I'm hardly one to comment on Satoshi's thinking.

Agree with you on this particular too good to be true thing. But I don't understand why the price would crash and take years to recover. 
My guess is nothing happens with the price. Maybe one day of a dip. But I don't think price is currently being propped up by the hope of the ETF. Most people got bored waiting for it two years ago.
So the lack of the ETF is just going to be another of the many shitty things that have happened bitcoin.  Honey badger don't care.  I mean fucking circle completely bailed on bitcoin. That should've been massively destructive but we're at a thousand bucks.

Of course. It's a ridiculous analogy.   Developers are employees in the real world.  They're not Gods over projects. They are hired to build things to spec.  Who decides spec?  Non-engineers. 
Why do they decide spec? Because their skillset is knowing what the market wants. Knowing what the product needs to do, to succeed.  They interact with the industry and the end-users.  This makes them more knowledgeable than the engineers, on multiple levels. 
Developers code, and should be respected when advising on technical limitations.  They don't decide how fast the plane should go.  They advise on how fast the plane *can* go, without crashing.

Patrick Byrne gone.  NASDAQ gone. Fidelity gone.  There is no over-senationalizing unless you're only looking at the one usecase where there is no activity happening:  peer to peer coffee shop transactions among consumers.  
In that strange little worldview, you're right. The fears of scaling are completely unfounded.  But that's because there's absolutely zero incentive for consumers to use bitcoin. 
If you actually acknowledge what's going on in the industry,  (something every dev team rarely has awareness of, or concern for) you'd realize the first use case for bitcoin came and went because we weren't ready for it: corporate-based transaction systems that wanted to use our block chain. And couldn't. They've come and gone now. No over sensationalizing about it. We missed that huge boat.
If your Bitcoin worldview is that it's only purpose should ever be "Bob sending $1.50 to Steve while they sit on a couch together" then you're right.  Scalability concerns are ridiculous.  But that's because Bob and Steve don't give a flying F about bitcoin. It's fidelity, NASDAQ, and Byrnes new stock market system that wanted to use it.
Oh well.

I love that the mindset here has matured to this point.  It's exactly correct.  Minus a strong incentive to onboard hundreds of thousands of new people who wish to buy and transact in Bitcoin, adding it as a payment option seems silly.

I'll be honest - I am confused about all this.  I know Layer 2 is detrimental.  But it has always been because it 'extends' bitcoins feature-set and functionality (in my head).  
Bitcoin was always limited in ways not related to being a high volume currency.  My understanding was that it was always intended for micro-transactions and eventually, high volume "peer to peer" movement of money.  Regardless of size of transaction.  
What it didn't have, and what Layer 2 was supposed to bring, was all those other fun things - like an app store with apps - where you could take something like a cell phone and literally make it into a guitar, or a video editing studio.

The difference:  With paper wallets, the only one responsible if you fuck up, is you.  I like having 100% control over my money.  I dont trust my money to any software, or any hardware.  Those things can fail, break, etc.  And then I have to blame a third party.  I can only blame myself if something goes wrong with my paper wallet.
I have complete control over my own destiny.

Satoshi really shouldn't have written what he wrote then.  
Where's the disconnect here?  
On one hand, you've got people literally quoting Satoshi, (or rephrasing exactly what he wrote) as far as bitcoins intended purpose. 
On the other hand, the result of those requirements, according to you, are a bunch of really terrible things. 
So either Satoshi is a complete idiot, and didn't think anything through, or the assessment of the negatives is overblown, (or could probably be mitigated in some fashion).

False.  Religion goes to the deepest parts of a persons identity and their ability to cope with the most painful events in life, such as death.  
Every time some jackass mocks someone's faith, they are simultaneously mocking and calling false the one thing that person holds to, to give them hope.  Meaning.  Both in their own life, and in the death of their closest family members.  It takes real ignorance not to grasp the ramifications of the faith someone has.  Respect it.

Nonsense.   They're selling a user-friendly onramp onto a powerful new technology, and a worldwide phenomenon.  Everyone's curious about bitcoin at this point. 
Television advertisements legitimize it in the eyes of the public even if they do nothing in response. There are plenty of people out there who would buy a little Bitcoin but don't know how.  Advertising is how they learn. 
Never understood the subset of users on this sub Reddit who literally shoot done any advertising, TV spots, PSA's and any form of "getting the word out".

There's the first problem. Developers are not the ones to come up with ideas, features, or timelines. Never. Never. First rule of product development.
The block chain *IS* A consensus tool. Create an interface for it and we have the first perfect, corruption-free voting system on earth.  Why can't we create a community-wide (world wide) voting system for the direction, timeline, and prioritization of Bitcoin development?   
I've actually been suggesting this for nearly 2 years. Every time the topic of "we need consensus among the good old boys club of core devs" comes up, I raise this issue. Developers should not be making product development decisions. Outside of policing technical limitations and acting as consultants for how to accomplish needs expressed by the industry. 
Once such a voting system is created, it very well could become a template for presidential election voting systems in the future. All someone has to do is make it. 
I realize developers are VERY uncomfortable allowing non-developers to make decisions.  I've been a project manager over web development for 16 years. The struggle between product development and programmers will probably always exist. 
But the reality is that the industry knows what the product needs to do. And when it needs to be done. The developers don't. Especially when we're talking about a financial system.

Just like blockstream's powerful corporate investors don't necessarily have selfish intentions. 
Could you clarify for me why the CIA would want Bitcoin to scale on-chain, and grow fast enough to stay ahead of user capacity?  
Because that's what Gavin wants.  Along with adhering the White Paper.  Pretty strange way to kill Bitcoin...

On the other hand, I've seen somebody sue someone else without using a lawyer, and cost that "someone else" over $100,000 in attorney fees. While they spent nothing more than court fees in the process. 
So if you're trying to cost somebody money, our wonderful legal system is perfectly welcoming to the individual without an attorney who just wants to destroy somebody else financially, using the legal system, while having no legit claim against them whatsoever.

Sorry, what evidence do you have that Craig was lying? We have one of the most honest people in this entire space saying that he was telling the truth. 
So where is your evidence that he wasn't?
Oh that's right. Because he didn't do ***what*** you wanted him to do. He didn't do it ***the way*** you wanted him to do it. 
Clearly you are unaware of the fact that someone was extorting him and threatening to out him. Doing it this way completely took the wind out of their sails without taking it to the point where he could be incriminated as the owner, by Australian tax authorities.
*Instead you defer to the idiotic assumption that someone with four PhD's too stupid to know the proper way to prove it.*
What do you think the chances are that he's too dumb to know? 
Do you also think he's so dumb, he doesn't know how you would react?  Do you ***actually*** believe he wasn't aware everyone would call BS?   
Do you really think this wasn't perfectly planned out?  Think a little deeper than surface level.
If the extortionist actually did "out" him at this point, you and everyone else here would laugh and ignore them. 
So guess what.  Mission accomplished. Simple minds are easily manipulated.  
Side note:  I know for a fact that CW has mass quantities of BTC that would be staggering to some here.  This bit of info is only a side note as having mass quantities of Bitcoin doesn't prove one is Satoshi.  But it sure narrows down the candidates.

From the Coindedk article linked-to below:  how entities can easily enjoy block chain tech without the need for a system of miners.  
Tell me why this guy is wrong:
"So why not just have a single banking ledger for the world?
This raises an interesting question. If it’s so expensive and complicated for each bank to run its own system that contains its own narrow view of the world – and then have to check it matches the other systems where the facts overlap – why not just pay somebody to run a single ledger that everybody agrees will be authoritative?
After all, as we showed above, any bank that wanted to could easily derive its own view of the world from this mega-table, completely trivially.
Of course, we’d have to give thought to how to mediate access to the ledger – who is allowed to observe or update which records – but we know how to do that … and it’s not an impossible problem.
*Are you mad?*
Now, it is tempting to say that such a thing would be insane: imagine how powerful would be the firm who ran such a system. And imagine the catastrophic implications for the world if there was a system outage!
Perhaps the expensive, error-prone, but fundamentally decentralised and robust (anti-fragile?) system we have today is a price worth paying.
But an interesting question arises: what if there a way to achieve the benefits of a globally shared system but without having to grapple with the difficult political question of how to control an all-powerful operator or how to deal with the risk of an outage of such an important, central piece of infrastructure?
Perhaps we can achieve this…
**The replicated, shared ledger**
Remember what we achieved in the diagram above: we created a single table that could describe all bank balances and which was inherently shared: different actors had different permissions to update different parts of it.
But the worry in the section above was that a shared global ledger would be controlled by a single powerful entity and that this centralized system could be a systemic risk. So can we make two tweaks to the model?
First, why not replicate the ledger massively. So, rather than one copy, have lots of copies. Perhaps one copy at every bank. So now there isn’t a single point of failure. We would have to worry about how those copies are kept in sync, of course, so this isn’t an unambiguous 'win' but having copies at each bank might also make integration with existing infrastructure somewhat easier, too. Perhaps this would also help ease adoption.
Secondly, why not have those who participate in the system – maybe just the banks or maybe their customers too – also be jointly responsible for maintaining and securing it. We know who everybody else is in this world, after all, so we know whom to punish if they cheat. So we replace a single powerful entity with a model where everybody contributes to the system’s security. 
If a single copy of the global, shared ledger is undesirable or risky, then replicating it to all the participants could give the best of both worlds. Now the problem becomes one of automatically keeping the systems in sync rather than manually reconciling and dealing with breaks.
The picture above looks superficially like the one I drew at the start of the article. But there’s a critically important difference. In this model, all participants have a copy of the ledger but only have the right to amend entries pertinent to them. So it is both replicated and shared.
And so this is why I call this concept the 'replicated, shared ledger'. I think this wording is better at evoking the right mental model than 'distributed ledger', for example.
And depending on whether you want to model balances, other assets or even agreements between parties, there are startups working on a project. I wrote a piece last year that attempted to make sense of the various players out there – and many more have emerged since then.

As long as mindless, childish, blind, one-sided idiotic posts like this continue to dominate the conversation here, this isssue will never get resolved. And bitcoin gets closer to failure. 
The issue is governance. Nothing else. Stop with the fucking tinfoil hat bullshit.  Nobody is trying to destroy bitcoin.

And much like the Internet in 1995, bitcoin desperately needs search engines, Amazon.coms, AOLs, Hotmails, and other use cases that bring the general public on board and improve their lives - or this experiment is going nowhere.
With all this arguing going on I still haven't seen any such services, innovations, or ideas being spawned anywhere in the Bitcoin space in over 2 years.  We saw that wave of "merchants accepting bitcoin" happening, but once that stopped, the space hasn't grown or evolved at all. 
I don't know if there's an entire army of entrepreneurs and innovators waiting for sidechains? Or if there just simply isn't anyone out there really doing anything. The only innovation I'm seeing, unfortunately, is in the private block chain space. And we're still sitting here laughing and pointing at them while nothing is happening on our end. And new VC money has dried up. 
Only posting this to get people talking about it. To get people wondering. To get the urgency back on the table. Once we're done bitching for nine months about this scaling issue, we are going to be facing the same problem we had beforehand: use cases for bitcoin, for the general public.

Yeah the one thing that has me so twisted in this debate is that this sub talks so much shit about everyone else creating "alt coins", but I continue to hear comment after comment directly contradicting the White Paper and words out of Satoshis own mouth. 
And when you actually corner people on that, they literally say that Satoshi was "out of touch", a shitty programmer, and didn't think things through.
So who is making the alt coin here?
I never agreed that miners should have so much power over the direction bitcoin goes, but that ***is the definition of bitcoin***.

Maybe he's understanding the White Paper to say that hashing power is how votes are cast with Bitcoin, not the opinions of people who don't contribute hashing power to the network.  
A lot of people understand the White Paper and/or Satoshi to have said this. (Accurate or not).
Thank you for being the one person in this entire thread to actually stop and ask:  "Wait. What's his thinking here?"
Believe it or not, people actually have reasons for why they say things.  Accurate or not, it's helpful to understand where he's coming from so a response more intelligent than "What a Clown" can be provided.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:57:22
I agree 100%.  And Bitcoin may just need a reality check so the people incessantly resting on its "network effect" actually start to worry.  
I have had to endure literally years of comments from people here telling me "relax" every time I pointed out the need for bitcoin to hurry up and evolve. 
There was so much apathy it was unbelievable. And exactly what I predicted, has now happened. We didn't evolve. We went stagnant. And now look what's happening. 
And yet still people pretend that bitcoins "network effect" is going to keep it King.

I apologize that I don't know the technicalities here, but I am feeling confident that if a small on-chain bump (larger than SW) were given, a large percent of the crew would be on board with it.
But then again, it doesn't matter if they are right?  Its the miners that have to be on board.  In any case, it seemed like an idea.  I should probably stop commenting.
@_date: 2016-03-29 14:12:58
I realize this is kind of a block size issue discussion, but as I've said before, as soon as the block size issue gets resolved we're going to end up right back where we started. Nobody's using Bitcoin. 
The industry that would've used it are the financial institutions that expressed a desire to convert business processes onto a block chain that could've supported their features, functionality, (and yes) volumes.
We've lost them now. That opportunity has sailed. For those of you on the sub (who are many) that continue to say we haven't lost any opportunities and there is no rush: this is where the sentiment comes from I think. 
So now we're back to wondering why mom and dad see no use for it.  We have shown (apparently) that we are only interested in small, peer-to-peer transactions from individual consumers.  Yet it's this very demographic that still has no incentive to use it.  So what do we do?
(Edited: rephrasing)
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:47:30
&amp;gt;maybe it will send a wakeup call to miners that they're not in charge
Miners were, by design, supposed to be in charge though right?  Just not in the current form we see today.  
Miners being in charge would be a positive... if "miners" equated to 500,000 hipsters with laptops around the world, collectively voting with their hashing power.  Right?  
@_date: 2016-01-23 19:15:00
Which scares me.  Because literally nobody is building anything on these layers above.  Where are the innovators and entrepreneurs? 
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:40:58
Thanks. Do you know what I might be thinking of then from the white paper? 
Because not only was it in there, but I remember actually thinking it was a really risky idea when I first read it. 
I thought to myself "this is crazy that Bitcoin is completely controlled by the decision of the miners as to which software they choose to run". 
But that was… Bitcoin. I explicitly remember internalizing that bitcoin was 100% about the miners. 
It made sense to me only in the scenario where "miners" are literally hundreds of thousands of individuals running on CPUs.
So what am I remembering incorrectly? Or misunderstanding.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:35:54


Exactly. And their whole point is, that is a bad thing.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:18:18


Sorry, who was it that ignored everyone for four years while the community was screaming that Bitcoin needed to scale immediately or else something like this would happen? 
Who was refusing to expand bitcoin's capabilities and telling everyone to "shut up" because they weren't "technically inclined enough" to understand things?  
I remember devs actually mocking these people. Calling them alarmists and "the sky is falling". "Relax" was literally their only response for almost 3 years.
There's a reason we are where we are today. And has absolutely nothing to do with BU.
Let's not rewrite history. We were all there.
I'm actually in support of whoever makes this happen. On either side. But I was there, week after week, watching everyone plead and beg to scale the code "now" for when we would need it later. 
The reason there are amateur offshoots happening at all… the reason BU exists at all, is because those requests were ignored..
Now we've made our bed and have to lie in it, because they waited too fucking long, and now everyone's rallied around a group that apparently writes shitty code.  This is one of the things they were warned about years back when they were too cool to listen.

How are they sitting pretty if the price goes down from here? They just purchased a bunch of coins at higher prices. 
In fact, how are they sitting pretty even if the price goes back up to $1300? They just put a lot of money in, all the way up. 
So it seems they either break even, or they're going to lose money. What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:01:34
And it will.  Unfortunately.  Until there's a light visible at the end of this tunnel, I don't see the price going up.  It will be interesting to see where it levels out at bottom though.
@_date: 2017-03-23 05:46:31
Do you think Blockstream as a "Core Dev Funding" platform could do anything to appease the paranoid, by opening up the platform in some fashion, publishing a public "policies" document outlining limitations for influence of investors over the code, and maybe just making it more of a "we just want to raise funds for Bitcoin development" organization...?   Rather than a centralized, for-profit-looking company that seems to fund only a couple guys to an extreme level?   
I can't help but believe that if it really is just a way to "encourage funding for development", it could be conveyed that way a little better than it currently is, and maybe put a lot of minds at ease. Because a lot of people are in support of what you guys have coded, but they're not in support of acknowledging that code because it's backed by what they feel is a centralized, potentially corruptible organization.

Wasn't Bitcoin supposed to work this way?  Miners vote with their hashing power?  
Honestly posts like yours rejecting this process (which are saturating this thread) strike me as "alt coins".  
Bitcoin has a definition. It includes the freedom of the network to do this when difficult decisions are on the table.  
Scoffing at a basic tenet of Bitcoin automatically throws one into "not Bitcoin" realm.  Also known as... you become the alt coin.  No?

&amp;gt;They said again and again that they do not and will not support segwit!
This is false.  They said they are 100% in agreement with SW and its features.  They just wanted a larger on chain increase than SW provides. So basically "SW Plus".  
So the statement that they're anti SW should be qualified because it sounds like a blind opposition to "anything from core". 
I have personally asked and confirmed this with BU lead devs and Roger himself has publicly stated this on the record numerous times.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:24:41


Bitcoin is now about whatever we want it to be.  That idiot Satoshi and his dumb white paper are ancient history.  So if someone says something that ***I*** don't agree with, I can tell them they're "not being bitcoin". Because the definition of bitcoin is now 1000% subjective!  /a

Dude.  Are you kidding me?  I lived through it.  I have posted literally every single day since June 2012.  
Why do you think Hearn had a ragequit in the first place?  He said why publicly.  It was because the community was screaming for scaling and getting ignored. Why do you think Gavin created Classic?  Because he was in the mood to "do something different" ?  It was literally the topic of discussion here for 2 straight years.  
What kind of insane fantasy land do you live in that you actually claim this wasn't happening?  
Nobody said Core "wasnt doing anything".  So do me a favor and don't change my words into something I obviously didn't say.  
***What I said, was that they were NOT pursuing scaling.***
And they weren't.  Thats WHY these idiot offshoots showed up in the first place!  Why do *you* think they showed up?   Randomly for no reason?  Seriously?
I seriously feel like im in the fucking twilight zone on this sub sometimes.  Reality has become so fucking distorted that what actually transpired is rejected as false.  I was here.  I read post after post, day after day, week after week.  I personally wrote posts about this topic ad nauseum and YES the response I got from everyone (including Core developers) was "RELAX". 
***There was an entire period where the entire "joke" around here were the "idiots" who "think the sky is falling" because scaling was not being pursued.***
Seriously what delusional world do you live in that you claim I just wrote a shit post?  This place has gone fucking nuts.
I have absolutely zero sympathy for the situation we are in right now.   The warnings came literally years ago and the developers were too busy telling everyone how fucking smart they were compared to everyone else, to listen.  I remember it clearly because we all got in huge arguments about how developers should not be making "product development decisions" or "deciding priorities and enhancements"
I guess you think all those conversations were not related to an overwhelming uproar calling for scaling right?  
Unreal. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:54:15
If you think bitcoin is completely done scaling forever like Luke says, then you can kiss bitcoin goodbye. It's done. I don't need to circle jerk about Luke to know that.

Even if he does, it's not a shocker. I mean it's pretty well-known that his suggestions have fallen on deaf ears. Just like Gavin's did. It's not some surprise. That's why there's a divide in the first place.

It's because they have an aversion to a centralized company with powerful investors possibly having a say in the way Bitcoin evolves.   Seems pretty reasonable to me given Bitcoins entire "reason for being".  
But that organization has also been described to me as a way to fund Bitcoin development. Because it's run by Bitcoin developers. 
*So at the end of the day it comes down to people's intentions, which nobody can claim to know.*
There should however be no confusion as to what people are worried about, but stagnation means death.  Have to pick our battles.  
@_date: 2015-05-21 12:37:50
At the risk of down votes, the general public also doesn't care about whether their funds can be seized. Every single financial tool every single person on this planet uses currently qualifies for that description. 
We have to try to remember. Not everybody is a libertarian anarchist. In fact, most aren't. They don't care about decentralization. They don't care about trust. They actually prefer trust. And they don't care about "the man" slightly infringing on their privacy or rights.  
The question then becomes, will bitcoin really be that big of a deal to a bunch of people who don't care about the very things it addresses?  Just playing devils advocate here.
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:23:13
Right.  And this transaction occurred on the block chain. Not on a Layer 2 system (they don't exist yet).  
Therefore that's what we're talking about right now.  
On chain.

Strangely, I recall him predicting pooled mining.  But apparently not articulating why that would be a bad thing in the same breath.  Like he just sort of glossed over it, acknowledging that one day there would be huge mining farms.  
He didnt say "Therefore we should do this" or "At that time, the proper path to take would be this, breaking them up, to prevent centralization".  He just sort of said nothing... which was weird to me.
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:39:38

@_date: 2017-02-05 03:11:01
Even if BU takes over, there is plenty of time to have a rational fair conversation with them. From what I'm hearing from everybody, they've tried to talk in the other direction and pretty much got the middle finger the whole time. So maybe at some point, someone on this side of things will lose a little bit of the ego and consider working together. There's no reason bitcoin has to die. It's not like they are all a bunch of insane lunatics. Much more complicated and serious situations have been worked out in humanity, in the past.

A friendly, open, public "counsel" of all major players to meet monthly. 
To weigh-in on industry needs, technical limitations, requests, suggestions, and working together to prioritize timelines.  People from all nations, all industries, all levels of users. From the Coinbase user, to the fellow in the village in Africa with the smartphone.  
Input.  Agreed upon direction. Working together to keep Bitcoin, Bitcoin... while tackling the tough questions and challenges that will arise.

Because I'm sorry, but developers are one small portion of what makes a system succeed.  We are blessed to have the best available to us. And we should never take that for granted. But other voices need to be included in the discussion.

I know that nobody's going to see this comment because it's way at the bottom, but this is absolutely the best conversation I think has been had here in months. This is the crux of the matter. This is the discussion we need to be having. And I rarely read through an entire thread, but every single comment here is interesting to me. 
I finally feel like we hit the nail on the head with the current problem and it's really interesting to see completely valid arguments in both directions that make total sense. This is one of those things that nobody's 100% right on. And nobody's 100% wrong. Hope we can work our way through it ultimately.

It's you guys who are constantly telling everyone that people are paid by Ver and worship Ver but I see none of that anywhere, in the real world.
Its almost as if you are the ones who are obsessed with Ver.  Not them.
Maybe your logic is that anyone who agrees with Vers assertions is automatically paid, and suckles at his teet nightly?

@_date: 2016-03-30 14:06:36
You need to understand human psychology and group behaviors to know why it's not priced in yet.  Without that, you'll continue to think it is.  
Just sit back and watch. When you see that you were incorrect hopefully you'll reassess why, and adjust for future similar situations.  
There is one extra caveat in this however. The uncertainty, disillusionment and infighting going on. This could dampen the rise significantly. 
If none of that was happening right now, you would absolutely see a humongous spike in price (speculative bubble) in the month or two prior to the halving.  
This likely would've lasted until a couple weeks post-halving, and then the bubble would pop.   Over time, it would slowly rise to is "new norm" price as the "real" post-halving supply/demand environment is established.

This is why the vast majority of people don't use local bit coins. And it's disappointing. Because it's one of the greatest resources out there. But human greed tends to ruin it.

Sorry can you clarify what you mean?   Buzzwords?   Centralized entity / company is what it is.   But again - there is much paranoia / mistrust powering the reaction to it.   
People assume that power breeds corruption.  That isn't always the case.  But sometimes it is.  This is why I said that one would need to be inside the minds of the people involved in Blockstream in order to make *any* accurate assessment of possible bad motives.  
Since that isn't possible, I think it's probably more important to move forward with keeping Bitcoin alive (SegWit etc).  
Truthfully, most companies don't last a year as per statistics.  So if people are that worried about blockstream owning bitcoin forever - it's likely they won't even be around five years from now.  Or it will have morphed into something else.
So I do there's an opportunity to open up the whole blockstream entity and make it more of an altruistic-looking funding platform for paying bitcoin developers. Rather than just a couple of guys, and a bunch of wealthy investors who obviously want a return on their investment.  
Maybe we can tackle that later. 
I do think there are things they could do which would put peoples minds at ease. But even then, some people just aren't comfortable with a couple of dudes deciding everything. Or a bunch of people who put a million bucks in, and want $2 million back one day possibly deciding what is written into the "sacred protocol code".  
Many feel this should remain hands off.  
But then, how do bitcoin developers get paid? I think Mike Hearn was trying to build a crowdfunding system that would pay bitcoin developers. But he got ignored and then laughed out of the building as I recall on that one.

Do you not see how this works? Of course everything I say is invalid. Of course everything I view is not in reality. 
You're a smart guy. Pretty sure you're aware how people devolve into apes when it comes to debates like this.
There's actually a really effective way to know if one side has lost their grip on reality. They make blind idiotic comments that are globally obviously false. Like calling Gavin a "retard". 
Also:  viewing everything through your lens of perfection, and describing the other side as 100% wrong.  Incapable of acknowledging both the good and the bad on both sides. 
I'm angry because reality is getting changed around here en masse. Anyone who's got an honest bone in their body knows that the rules, the definition, and the identity of Bitcoin is being changed.  
People grasping at straws to come up with new excuses why hashing power is not the vote anymore. Gavin is a lying crook who is too "retarded" to function. 
When one side is sacrificing common sense to blindly support their bias, I lose respect. And they are the last people who should be talking about others realities.

Comments like this are just fucking crazy to me. I have to be honest. 
Every system has a spec sheet. 
If you deviate from that spec sheet, you've created something new. 
Just because a group of people are adhering to the spec sheet doesn't make them idiots or religious fanatics. 
It makes them… oh I don't know… people who want to remain accurate?
I literally can't figure out what's going on here. I never thought I'd see the day where the entire bitcoin sub was talking shit about Satoshi and saying he's irrelevant, along with his white paper. 
I mean really what the heck is going on… this is just fucking weird.  ��
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:13:04
Hopefully. But I still think significant amount of longevity is needed. I don't necessarily see them saying "Oh, bitcoin!". But they will say "X company has been providing X services for X years, and we can take advantage of those services for our block chain needs". 
Keeping in mind that these companies have zero interest in a lot of the ideologies we may have. They'll just want a trusted centralized company with a longstanding reputation to help them streamline their business operations with the biggest block chain network. So I can absolutely see them partnering with Bitcoin block chain companies. 
But they need to exist first.  I think the next big wave of money making opportunities will be those companies operating on the layer above which will facilitate other businesses to make use of the Bitcoin block chain without risk.

So I was trying to think of a way to do this in small increments. Rather than make him wait an entire month for a wire. Because he's pretty pissed right now that I haven't paid. Income is tight.  
Thought it would be really cool if I could just funnel small amounts to him every couple days just to "show good faith" that I am in the process of paying them back. I can't expect him to go meet some dude in an alley so localbitcoins is out.

Wait. Isn't this ***exactly*** what BU, Gavin, Hearn, Roger, have been saying about the core Dev team and blockstream?

Sorry with all due respect, as a project manager of over 15 years, the whole "quality software takes time" excuse in this particular situation is no longer valid. I've seen incredibly complex systems released in 1/8th the amount of time.  Fully-tested and secure.  
But those projects had product and project managers who were connected to the market which the product was being created for.  Reasonable timelines were expected and *the code did not suffer as a result*.  
Had we allowed the coders to dictate the project timeline, every one of those products would've been so late to market that the product would've failed.

If the banking system wanted to use Bitcoin in 6 months would the Bitcoin system be able to handle their volumes?  
Didn't we already establish that this wouldn't work when Fidelity expressed interest and then walked away from Bitcoin due to slow transaction times and insufficient capacity?
People love to say that it's spreading FUD, alarmism and that "everything is fine".  But this is the exact demographic that would benefit the most from this technology, and our network can't support it. That's called opportunity cost.
I'm not saying banks are who Bitcoin is made for.  I am saying that right now, I see no other demographic with incentive to use Bitcoin.  And yet, we can't even support their speed/volume needs.  
This is a bad thing because non-bank financial companies are also looking elsewhere for the same reason. Companies that we don't hate. Because they aren't banks.

And lest we forget, that's exactly why we are in this situation in the first place.  This happened because of inactivity.  Literally years of forward progress on scaling.  Nobody is trying to "destroy bitcoin".  But inactivity has created significant opportunity cost.  And that has been interpreted as damaging to bitcoin, by the BU supporters.  And I struggle to disagree.  
Eventually someone threw up their hands and said "fuck this" and created Classic.  Then XT ... then BU.  These things didn't come about because a bunch of insane idiots wanted to ruin bitcoin.  Rational people understand this situation for what it is.

Problem is, we still have to use onramps and offramps to use Bitcoin and THAT benefits "banksters".   We can't use bitcoin in a closed loop manner. We still have to cash it in and cash it out to Fiat. It's still pegged to Fiat value.
Getting paid in it, paying our rent, food, car payment with it. Until then, everything benefits the old system. 
Rather than kick and scream about these bitcoin debit card options, we should be kicking and screaming that nobody's building a financial infrastructure on top of the block chain that can facilitate a closed loop system.

Thanks for the information. Definitely think some of these coins would stay "clean" if they were stored with 0% humidity. So I'll start doing that. And I will ask the guys if they can clean it. 
Do you know what the material is on the edge? Is that gold trim or is it just some sort of paint? I suppose that would be important to know for sure. For certain
My regular coins with the hologram seem to be staying good but they'll be going into 0% humidity now too.  I may be imagining things but they seem a little less brilliant than they were.  I bought 3 of the St Pete coins and I'm bummed they've degraded so much.

This is important.  These spikes are not organic adoption. They are speculation, manipulation, and pumpers.  This means the price rise will be temporary.  
Slow and steady to $770 and I would've felt confident that it would stay there.  Granted, the halving will likely bring a new higher "bottom".  
But slow and steady is the main indicator of organic adoption.  And organic adoption is the only thing that can support a higher price, long term.

Good post.  Should point out though that technically, the Fidelity Effect didn't just relate to transaction capacity.  It also related heavily to Bitcoins complete lack of feature-sets.  
Simply put, businesses need to be able to do more than "lots of transactions".  They need to be able to perform a ton of different *functions* on the block chain as well.  This is why things started popping up like Counterparty, Colored Coins, and MasterCoin very early on.  People immediately realized that Bitcoin needed to be extensible.  It needed to "do more" if it was ever going to be used in the "real business world".  Back in those days I was calling for something like the iPhone "app store".  Foundational code that could allow a million possible "apps" to be built on top of Bitcoin.
Either way - all of this was assumed to be on "Layer 2"-esque platforms.  That's why there was fanfare for SideChains I believe.  I was also told that this new "app" base layer code is part of SegWit?

@_date: 2016-06-17 15:02:23
The problem is, this isn't happening. There is no industry going up around it, on the layers above. The question is why? 
I don't think anybody disagrees with you about side chains or building on the layer above. Sure they would love some scaling on chain, but none of those proponents I've seen have a problem with an industry flourishing on the layer above.
The problem is it's not happening. Nobody is building anything.
*Therefore this whole discussion should be about that.*
Why it's not happening. An honest look at it. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:51:03
So you're saying that if something just works, therefore it is sufficient.  And complete.  And will succeed in a marketplace where the industry can't even use it due to silly, irrelevant things like capacity or features.

Why do we always have to go to extremes? Why are they automatically "spreading lies"?  
Or:  Everyone is paid. Everyone's a shill.  Everyone has ulterior motives. The opposing side DEFINITELY wants to "destroy Bitcoin". 
Please remember something: 
In situations like this where a debate rages so strong, for so long, it does so for one specific reason: because there are ***valid concerns*** on both sides. 
Valid, rational, understandable feelings. If it were as simple as one side being a bunch of "lying idiot psychos", that side would not garner any support in the first place. 
So stop describing them like that. And they need to stop describing you guys like a bunch of corrupt blockstream worshipers.

@_date: 2016-06-22 19:35:01
So that's your entire strategy? 
Demanding, and convincing people to do things? 
Why do you have to do that? Oh that's right. Because like I said. There is no infrastructure of financial services on top of the bitcoin block chain yet which can facilitate a closed loop system.
So I rest my case.
You pay rent and you had to convince your landlord. Guess what? I own a home, and there isnt jack shit I can do to convince my mortgage company to accept payment in bitcoin. I have to use a bitcoin debit card or something similar.
Guess what? You get paid freelancer salaries. Well I own a business. My payment comes in the form of online sales. There's no way for me to get that money in the form of bitcoin.  It comes through the visa MasterCard system whether I like it or not.  
*So your enthusiasm and fanaticism is interesting, but you're not grounded in reality. You've literally ignored every other use case except your own. Which is not a good trait when you're trying to come across as a rational individual.*
As I stated:  Bitcoin still completely lacks the financial products and services necessary for a closed loop system.
And by the way, let's say you have a real job and work for a company.  Good luck getting any HR department to pay you in bitcoin. My guess is 99% of them will refuse, no matter how much you "demand it".

Use the website to generate the paper wallets. Print them. Load them with your balance by sending to the receiving address. 
And if your goal is to hold your balance for 10 years plus, which it should be, place them in a safe deposit box at a bank. 
Write down all the public keys (receiving addresses) and keep that on your computer.  Include a couple extra paper wallets with a zero balance so that you can add more coins to them while they sit in the safe deposit box.
I typically put 10 BTC or so, on each one.

Miners.  Traders.  And speculators.   Those are the vast majority of people "using" Bitcoin. In other words, few to nobody are using it for what it's intended.  
I will repeat since you are intentionally being dense:
Nobody = the general public. No mass adoption. Grandma and grandpa. Mom and dad. Best friend even. Nobody. Is using it. You knew what I meant.
I want mass adoption.  
But we need two major things first. A killer app that actually incentivizes mass-adoption.  And an infrastructure of financial services on top of the block chain. 
We have neither. At seven years. That is concerning to me.

That's the thing.  It's what coinbase charged me to simply perform an ACH or EFT (electronic funds transfer).  Only they know the breakdown.  
But technically what the other guy said is probably right. It's not an EFT transfer fee. It's coinbase acting as a broker and bitcoin being treated like a stock. 
You're going to pay the same type of fee and wait the same long ass time to get cash out of stocks on E*TRADE. 
**But to me that says Coinbase should not be used as a bitcoin wallet. And it should not be viewed as a bitcoin bank.**
**If they're trying to be "bank for bitcoin", they don't have any justification to charge $53 and make me wait 7 days just to do a withdrawal / transfer of my own money.**

Actually maybe he's referring to the fact that there's literally no financial industry being built on top of the block chain and we desperately need one. 
I realize he just got down voted to hell, but he's actually correct. We've got the block chain. And we've got the ability to play on exchanges and speculate and try to make money off Bitcoin, but there is still no financial services industry going up around bitcoin. 
I guess everyone's waiting for sidechains and scaling capacity increases.

Thank you. So the assertion that in a situation exactly like this one, if 11 miners choose core and nine miners choose BU software, core remains bitcoin… - - this Is an erroneous understanding of the process?

So your response is basically saying:
*"You're not just moving your money around. And you're not working with a cash system that is light years cheaper and faster than traditional banking.  You're on Bitcoin ETRADE and you're selling some stocks".*
Strange but that is not how I pictured Bitcoin was supposed to work.  I thought I was being my own bank, managing my own money, and using a system that enables me to move it anywhere in the world, instantly, for very little cost?  I thought this was supposed to be better than my bank?
So basically Bitcoin, as it stands today, is just a stock, and Coinbase is the ETRADE of bitcoin, and is just a broker and Im the dummy for using them to cash out.   But ... as far as I know, they're the only reasonably convenient, quick, easy way to cash out.   Right?
So bitcoin services aren't facilitating what it was intended to be / do.  Its basically a stock system now, and the only way you can store and withdraw and move it around using 2nd layer services is to pay insane fees to do so.  Insane fees and waiting a full week.
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:58:59
I am a small business owner and have run an online store for about 13 years. We added bitcoin as a payment option about three years ago. In that time I think we have had about 10 bitcoin orders. Grand total.
Right now bitcoin is not prepared to be digital cash. When I say not prepared, I just mean there's no infrastructure to facilitate it with the general public. It's prepared right now, but not really being used for that quite yet.
Bitcoin doesn't have the infrastructure and financial services that need to be built on top of the block chain to facilitate the various incentives necessary to stir up mass adoption and substantial commerce.  Hopefully that is coming next.
The most I will see buying from me are people from this community, or niche-level enthusiasts.  We don't do a whole lot of orders anyways. Maybe 10 to 20 orders per day. But in three years, just 10 bitcoin orders. And that's with offering at first 10% off, and currently 5% off. It did not make any difference.
Bitcoin itself is completely ready to be a world reserve currency, and a peer to peer cash system. Unfortunately the biggest problem is that on ramps and off ramps are still needed. 
This means people have to get Fiat into the Bitcoin system before they can transact. Likewise, there needs to be "closed-loop" environment for this to really take off.  Getting paid in Bitcoin and being able to pay all your expenses in Bitcoin.  Because onramps and offramps are still necessary, the cost savings of Bitcoin are often lost, or dramatically reduced, as centralized 3rd parties take their cut of every transaction, on top of mining fees in each transaction. 
On the plus side, there is literally a brand-new, wide open, completely untapped world of riches awaiting entrepreneurs who want to start building financial services in this completely open field on the layer above the block chain. Nobody has done it yet.  Many have tried.  I have a feeling that will be the next goldrush in FinTech. 
This is all just my somewhat uninformed opinion. And I welcome anyone to correct or completely negate everything I've said, in response.

For the life of me I can't figure out how sites like this ever go bankrupt. They literally are raking in thousands of dollars every hour, and their overhead has got to be minimal to nonexistent. In comparison. 
Once you get the thing up and running, it's just an engine that keeps churning out fees. Hundreds of them every second. What costs could they possibly have? Aside from server, rent, electricity, payroll. And it's a tiny operation with just a few people right? The staggering amount of money that site should've been generating… I just don't get it.

How would you like me to prove it?   I hold no ether now so why would I be shilling for them?   I put $10k into the IPO two years ago. I was at the Miami conference where it was announced and stood next to Vitalik while the media mobbed him.  Also attended the Clevelander hotel party they all went to.  
I fully cashed out as soon as we were allowed to put our wallets onto an exchange.  I made about $60,000 on my investment but could've held till it hit $25 and made $790,000 instead.  I hate thinking about it.  It's so depressing.  I'm currently 100% in Bitcoin now (soldall my ether profits to Bitcoin and pulled it all offline).

No concern. It's been open code (that is very simple and basic), which has been analyzed up the ass by every person in this community for years.  
There are additional steps you can take like clicking the link to the GIT page and downloading the zip of the web pages from there.  That will ensure you're getting the real stuff. 
And you can be OCD and load that zip onto a fresh install of Windows that has never been online.  Etc etc.  
But for the most part the chance that anyone is snooping on your computer waiting for you to make a paper wallet, is about one in 10 billion. So just disconnect the Wi-Fi, make your paper wallets, and print.
It's free and safe.

Uhhhh the bitaddress code has been analyzed to oblivion for over six years by literally thousands of people.  It's the most widely known, and widely used paper wallet system in this entire community. That isn't a relevant concern anymore.
Also, when I said trust, I was referring to after they are made. I don't have to rely on a hardware wallet to keep working, or software to be bug-free. Once they're made, I am 100% in control.  And to blame.

Remember when Satoshi said (accurate paraphrase) "Another benefit of Bitcoin - its practically free". 
Is the general sentiment on this sub that Satoshi is like the senile old grandpa who is a nice Santa figure but a mostly irrelevant player, who had some silly ideas on what Bitcoin should be?  Because I genuinely get that vibe from folks here.
If not, why are these blatantly obvious criteria for the identity of bitcoin considered out of touch and poo poo'd here?  
I mean, you would think they would be almost the 10 Commandments, and treated as such, to the point that all development centers around adhering to these certain foundational criteria.  But that's not happening.

The problem is that SegWit isn't the problem in the first place.  The people who oppose the effort aren't opposing because of SegWit.  At least not the concept of layer-2 infrastructure.

There's got to be a compromise possible between the two sides. Some way to enable significantly larger blocks on chain without the security concerns or "bad code" concerns mentioned by Core about BU.  
In the end the only way we move forward is if egos are suppressed on both sides, and a deal is struck which acknowledges the needs of all parties in this community.  
This can be done.  And should be done.

LOL!   Wow...
The community does not only consist of core developers.  You are aware of that, right?   Because from what I have seen, it is mostly (only?) certain developers that think scaling is relatively unimportant.  And they are a tiny monitory of what constitutes "the community".  It is literally *everyone else* who I've seen, in support of it.  We have crazy-different views of reality and that kind of worries me.

It really comes down to that. And anything that comes out of their mouth is just a mask to deflect from the fact that they're pissed off they missed out. 
It really is that juvenile, and simple. Every single argument they come up with is easily refuted and holds zero water. Every one. They said bitcoin would be a failure at $60, and the same thing at $1000.
The biggest thing bitcoin has taught me is how human beings can deny reality and live in psychological denial.

The fact is, if this technology is going to be used in the real world, there's going to have to be trust, reputations, centralized services, and other things that everybody here hates. 
Otherwise nobody's going to use it.
The "power users" will always be free to use bitcoin the way it was intended. Fly under the radar, shuffle and shake their balances, and do all kinds of cool fun things to avoid paying taxes.  
I think what we need to protect is the ability to continue using bitcoin "raw". Providing new ways to increase its use in the real world needs to be tolerated as long as this capability isn't lost.

The current price is not based on any actually cut in supply yet.  It's purely speculative buying in anticipation for the halving.  We have 3 more weeks until that happens so there's every reason to believe this will continue.  Especially as the media begins hyping the halving and outsiders hop in to try and make a buck.

Yeah definitely they cost money. I would just keep the paper wallets in a safe place for free then. 
The issue for me here is control. Me being 100% in control of my money. Honestly I don't know why everyone is so erect for hardware wallets. I am from 2012 when everyone used bitaddress.org for long-term cold storage. 
Then at least you don't have to worry about software or hardware getting corrupt or broken. I used to store all my shit in the cores software wallet.DAT and it got corrupt one day and I almost lost everything. 
Never again. No more electronic medium for me.  Of any kind.  Paper only.  
Then, if something goes wrong, it's my own fault. Which means I'm 100% in control of what happens. I don't feel that way with a hardware wallet, or leaving it on some software.

Does he not have the ability to tell people with commit access what priorities to put ahead of other things, what enhancements are on the table while others are simply not? 
If so, I honestly can't think of a bigger bastardization to this entire technology than a single centralized for-profit company, telling protocol developers what they should and shouldn't be doing with the code that affects the entire worlds use of Bitcoin. 
That's direct and totally unabashed control over bitcoin on multiple levels.  
This company has hired bitcoin developers who directly code for bitcoin. The conflict of interest seems astronomical. It should not be tolerated in this technology at all. I'm blown away that it ever was allowed.  
So let me know what Im misunderstanding here, because my understanding is that block stream has the ability to influence people who directly write the code. And that's not good.
It's irrelevant what you or I think. If they've got the ability to decide what gets coded, that is an inappropriate level of control.
As a sidenote, the whole "the miners don't have to accept it and can vote against it with their hashing power" flies right out the door in my opinion, when the miners themselves have stated "we are not technically oriented enough to make these types of decisions" and they just go along with whatever. 
That's the reality.  And that's exactly why the voting being done is supposed to be done by a mass quantity of individuals who are mining, not single conglomerations who aren't even technically oriented. 
When you've got a hive mind, and you've got thousands of people who can make a decision, then you've got a quality vote. When you've got 6 people in China making all the decisions, and they've plainly stated they don't know or care either way, then you've got a bad voting system happening.

Sorry bro.   Bitcoin development has shifted to the mentality of making it a "store of value" or "digital gold".   The days of pushing hard for it to become a means of transfer, a currency, or a peer to peer payment system as Satoshi envisioned, are sadly gone.

My problem is with your company having any say whatsoever in what the Bitcoin protocol code ends up looking like. 
For obvious reasons. This is a decentralized open source system that prides itself on not being controlled by any single corporate entity. 
I mean my God do I even have to type that sentence? Apparently…
Your company's involvement and influence over the priority list, enhancement strategy, and timelines is an absolute bastardization of everything this entire technology stands for. And I'm not being irrational in the slightest, to say that.

I've had the bitcoin payment option on my store for three years. I've had a grand total of 10 sales in that time. 
Just because I add an option for people to pay that way doesn't mean anyone's going to use it. People have visa and MasterCard. That's what they use. Or PayPal. 
Nobody uses bitcoin to buy things these days. Because nobody's getting paid that way. There's no closed loop system. 
There's literally no way for me to receive my store sales as bitcoin. Because 100% of my customers use Visa and MasterCard. And none of them want to use bitcoin. 
So your entire theory falls apart right at the beginning.

I didn't say I removed it. I said nobody's using it. 
You seem to be missing the point repeatedly: 100% of my income, comes from the visa and MasterCard system. 
I can't demand anyone to change that. 
So since your entire philosophy centers around "demanding that people do things you want", your entire philosophy fails in every use case, except your own. 
Therefore you should stop telling people that this is a possible thing to do, unless they live your exact life.

I am in support of lightning and layer 2 stuff. I'm a weird hybrid person in this debate. I don't even know where I would fit into comfortably. 
I do know that I feel a lot of opportunities have gone in the shitter because bitcoin was incapable of supporting their transaction capacities. Back when Gavin was screaming and yelling that nothing was getting done in development, and people were just arguing all the time. 
I've feel like that has fucked us in multiple ways over the last three years. Fidelity effect is just the traditional thing to point to for that but there's been others. 
As for conspiracy theories, usually they're completely idiotic right? Well here's why they're not really that idiotic in this case:
There's a fucking centralized for-profit company with millions in investors, and they've literally bought-out the most influential bitcoin developers. They made them employees.
Therefore they control what they do. They decide the priority list for bitcoin. Some random-ass company that could go under in three years, is controlling this worldwide decentralized currency development process. 
That's why there are conspiracies flying around. Because there is a massive conflict of interest on the table. This is a horrendous bastardization of what bit coin was supposed to be.  
*When you got on board years ago, did you support the concept of some random dude starting a company with a bunch of rich investors, and purchasing all the Bitcoin developers for their own benefit?*
I didn't.

Yeah those newspapers are extremely rare, and thanks to Satoshi's comment, they're pretty valuable now.  
I just learned today that coins need to be stored at "as close to 0% humidity" as possible.  I wasn't taking those precautions.  And someone I know who deals with coins agreed with what you implied:   that the plastic container these are in, are not proper coin storage.   
However, as you can see from one of my pictures (this is one of the St Petersburg coins), they do seem to be in a similar container to yours, which have been professionally graded:    
The tarnish almost look like fingerprints on the edges, which bugs me, because Mike should've known not to do that.  I actually asked these guys if they could tell me whether they can be professionally cleaned, and instead I got some half-snarky comments about it being a pointless coin, so "who cares":  
Can you tell me where you got yours graded?   I wonder if they will clean them for me?  Its brand new tarnish so maybe its easy to get off.   Store yours in zero humidity.  I bought some of those silver metallic bead-tray humidity things.  And I seal it in an airtight pelican case now.  Keeps the humidity at zero.   Wish I had done this before.

The problem is that we still need onramps and offramps.  Until you can use Bitcoin in a closed-loop system (get paid in Bitcoin and pay all your expenses with Bitcoin) we need centralized third-party services to facilitate the transition between Fiat and bitcoin.  The onramps from the banks and offramps back out to the banks require regulated financial entities.  
Bitcoin can become truly peer to peer in all ways when fiat isn't needed and peer to peer is the norm.  But, technically, it can do peer-to-peer now as well.

It really concerns me how many people here seem to be 100% unaware (and apathetic) about how products succeed or fail in a marketplace.   There seems to be absolutely zero concern about that part of the equation, and 100% focus on the code.  The code and nothing else.  Not even whether people can use the product.

Yes, because we are all idiots. I think everyone is painfully aware that core supporters think people with opposing viewpoints are unintelligent.  
Centralization is a major issue for Bitcoin.   Block size is a major issue if we give even the slightest shit about Bitcoin succeeding in the real world.  Or the industries that hoped to use Bitcoin and passed on it because it couldn't support their volume needs.  Both are major issues and one does not need to be "bamboozled" to think that way.  
Although denying that one of the two is an issue... is something I'm only seeing from people in your camp. Isn't it usually the intelligent ones capable of acknowledging both sides of an argument?  Oh, the irony. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:56:09


Sorry, what? The main developers who code for Bitcoin were hired BY a centralized company that has directly influenced the direction, priority timelines, and enhancement list for the bitcoin protocol itself. 
Are you not aware of that company? 
That's the conflict of interest. The response I always get to this is "Well do you expect us to work for free?". The natural response being of course: "No, just don't work for a company that wants you to modify bitcoin in a manner they deem appropriate (or better yet, at all)". 
Just because they've said no to other companies, doesn't mean they don't work for a company that is directly influencing the protocol. Sometimes I feel like I'm in the twilight zone on this sub. Were you just not aware of this? Or trying to deflect.
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:45:56

Yes.  
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:06:30
Right.  So in this case the obvious problem (as I understand it) is that it's too conservative to address the expectations of the opposing side.  This is where the argument comes in. They want more (unlimited).  Core wants minimal (maybe too little for a long term solution).  
So my original suggestion then comes into play.  They give a little more.  Maybe kick it to 8.  And maybe commit to release higher over the coming years.  Concerns about safety are addressed.  Discussion happens because Blockstream realizes their product won't ever see the light of day with such a minimal increase.  And they agree to bend a bit.  
There's a way to do this.  It I have not seen willingness to bend on Cores side (or I should say by cores employers).  Maybe this is because Bitcoin code is now controlled by a company.  And they have priorities or rules (I'm speculating) or a game plan for their own product.  The reason why doesn't matter really.  That's what generates all the arguing and distractions.  At some point someone's got to buckle a bit and give a little.

Why would they dismiss it? They want on chain scaling. This whole mentality that they're all just a bunch of crazies who can't be appeased is… well… bullshit. Watch the bitcoin uncensored thing with Roger Ver. He's perfectly rational, reasonable, and grounded.  
These people want us to stop missing huge fucking opportunities in the financial industry. It's as simple as that. We missed a ton of opportunities for bitcointo go mainstream in the one demographic where there's an actual usecase:  Finance.  While we sat on our asses moving at a snails pace and simply refusing to scale, they came and went. 
It's nice that things are finally moving forward. But holy shit the stuff we've missed out on already.

Not trying to be Debbie downer, but I thought it would crash at 1000. Since it hasn't, I'm thinking it will either crash after they reach the all-time high, or after the Chinese new year has come and gone. Jan 30?  I can't shake the feeling that this is some sort of year end thing related to taxes.  Or at the very least, a nice gradual artificial pump.

Do you understand the concept of numbers and probability?  I literally just explained this.  
There's a greater chance of you getting hit by a lightning bolt than you ending up in front of an angry Bitcoin hacker at a stop light who will also follow you home and devise a way to break into your house and steal what might be 0.5 BTC from your laptop.  
It's just stupid.  That's why I said:  if you've got tens of thousands of them and are dumb enough to keep them in your back seat on unencrypted paper wallets, then yeah.  Don't get the bumper sticker or license plate.  Any other situation is not really a concern. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 06:41:54
&amp;gt;We've simply thought it out and can easily see that it's still a fledgling, crippled, child-like currency today that no one will use yet... At least not in the 1st world.
Why do you think it still fledgling? We've been sitting here for four years waiting for development to enhance this thing and make it what its supposed to be. It used to be exactly what Satoshi called it.  It was succeeding as a peer to peer payment system. 
And then it grew.  It needed to scale years ago. 
In 2014 Gavin said all he ever saw was bickering, stagnancy, and no forward progress.  He was seriously concerned whether Bitcoin could *remain* what it was made to be. 
*That's* why it's still. fledgling.  That's why it's crippled as a currency.  It didn't start out crippled. It has become crippled. 
I understand what you're saying about the preference for a currency to be a store of value.  But by very definition, bitcoin already is that. I'm not clear on why part of the definition includes "never depreciates" because everything depreciates. Even gold. 
But by the remainder of the definition, bitcoin already is a store of value. Is it not?  Are you intending to say that it needs to be stable? Because that's something different. 
Fluctuations are going to happen at this stage. That doesn't mean it can't be a currency or a payment system. It may not be stable enough to support the paranoias of a full 7 billion users, but there are enough users today that are happy to use it as a payment system and can't. Because of the lack of forward progress in development and scaling.
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:06:27
Agreed. The one common sickness among all these types of people is that it doesn't matter what bitcoin does, how long it sustains, or what value it goes to. They still say the same shit they said on day 1, years prior.  Learned that by reading the technology sub mega thread on bitcoin last week.  
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:48:51
Sorry can you rephrase that entire thing? I'm not following what you're shooting for. Sincerely. 
I have a feeling that what you wrote doesn't negate what I wrote though. There's a company who has employed the top bitcoin code writers. The ones who have the most influence over what gets accepted and what doesn't. 
I don't give a hoot about what mental gymnastics are used to deflect from this. It's an inappropriate conflict of interest. So let me know what you're trying to say. I'm always open to listening.

This I agree with completely.  Individual miners should decide. Then at least the decision making is done by millions of miners. Not individual mining company CEOs.

Understood. But discussions are always possible. The problem on the table is that it's gaining quite a bit of support (blocks/hashing power). So a conversation is necessary. At the end of the day, someone's got to give. Both are probably going to have to give a little.

@_date: 2016-11-18 18:05:34
Can you go into a little more depth on what your service is exactly? 
I've been screaming for a decentralized exchange for years. But the problem has always been the need for on ramps and off ramps. 
As long as you still have to cash out to Fiat, centralized exchanges with connection to Banks is necessary. 
How do on ramps and off ramps work with your system? And what are the fees to buy and sell?
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:46:13


We would be if the financial market was able to actually use it. But they can't. They've said why as well. Reasons range from speed and capacity insufficiencies, to feature-set insufficiencies.  As a result, opportunities for widespread use cases have been lost, repeatedly, and the price stays low. 
It's incredible when I see proponents of "little or no change to bitcoin" simultaneously complaining about how low the price is. They don't seem to be able to connect the dots on why that is. 
Financial services seem to be the only widespread use case for this technology at this time, and they are not able to use it. This is why the price is low. 
There's a direct correlation between slow development speed, lack of features, and an improper set of development priorities… and the:
1) low price. 
2) lack of widespread use.
3) virtually nonexistent consumer adoption.

What if you bought at $90, then mined 60,000 dogecoin with the machine in your bedroom, sold those for 10 BTC when the price spiked, moved it over to ripple and purchased some of that, waited for it to go up and sold some to buy ethereum, then moved it back into BTC, and the price dropped $400, and then sent it to Cryptsy where you played trading with 15 different coins.  
How in the holy fucking shit are you supposed to document any of that?
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:18:17
Then here's what you do:
Instead of sitting here for the next three years acting like you don't want to bend even a little bit, and get this shit moving forward, you contact the BU developers. 
You tell them that you're willing to do something they're hoping for (like use some of their code/concepts) as long as they let you go in there and fix their fucked up code. 
You figure out what it is they want, and what they would be happy with. And you buckle a little bit on what you weren't willing to do previously. In exchange, they give you something, or allow you to address your worries about their shitty code.
That's called compromising. That's called working together. 
That's called realizing that your solution is not going to get approved. And neither is theirs.  In the current form. It's realizing that bitcoin is going to be fucked, unless you do this. And unless they join you in doing this. 
Compromise. Talk.   Bend a little bit. Do something that may not make you comfortable, in exchange for something else. 
For the greater good.

@_date: 2016-12-11 08:42:50
You are so confused and twisted that you don't even realize what you're saying contradicts itself. You support layer two stuff which is just going to create centralized regulated trackable financial institutions. Yet you talk shit like that's not what bitcoin is about.
Core is building a foundation right now entirely intended to support that ecosystem.  The entire argument is that they are taking us away from on chain direct transactions. Don't you even grasp that? The very thing you say bitcoin isn't intended for is exactly what it's going to become.
Then why don't you support on chain stuff that "doesn't require trust of a third-party"? Ever heard that phrase before in this space? Like maybe every day? 
You don't even know what you're talking about. Nothing you say makes sense and you contradict yourself left and right.  I don't give a flying fuck if you don't like my language. I don't like the way you think, and that's 100 times worse than any noise that comes out of my mouth.
I listed above a bunch of institutions that came and left. If we are lucky, they will come back when SegWit and other scaling solutions go live.  Because then, others will jump on this new layer 2 ecosystem. 
But either way were coming right back to what you say you don't support. So I guess you're a big blocker now?  Because lightning is no fucking different than Fidelity as far as my example goes.  
And most importantly of all? If you actually think bitcoins going to go anywhere in this world, ever? You better believe it's going to need institutional involvement from actual financial companies that have reputations and centralized governance. Welcome to the real world.

No dude. That was from the halving. Remember? 
And of course your numbers are wrong: it went from 300's to $600's.  
AKA:  doubled in value for a sane, logical, rational reason exactly like people (including me) predicted. 
What else did it do?   Exactly what I said it would do: It went too high, spiking to $780.

No you actually did say exactly that. You said moving coins out of coinbase equals a taxable transaction. 
That's a completely absurdly false statement. And as a "cryptocurrency accountant" you should know that.
The fact that it's "hard to know where it's going" is completely irrelevant.
You're literally making no sense. When you take $100 out of the ATM, is it "difficult to know" where you're taking it?

It's not unfounded speculation. Unless something happening hundreds of times is considered irrelevant.

Demanding bets is juvenile.  I saved your username to make you eat crow when the price crashes.

There's always some cocky jackass like you who comes along during pumps, and lists all his "rational" reasons for why the price is going up. 
Talks a lot of shit, acts cocky, and tries to pick fights/arguments.
Of course it's *always* organic adoption. Even though absolutely *nothing* new has happened.  And then it crashes $300. Mysteriously these people disappear into the ether when that happens.
You're probably new. If you're not, then you have no excuse for this nonsense.  This is a pump.  We are up nearly $400 in 3 weeks. Give me a fucking break.

I'll never understand how you can be a Bitcoin fan and still suckle at the teet of a privately owned, privately controlled, centralized company funded by people that want to get rich off of bitcoin by controlling the direction it goes in.  
Seriously.  Let me ask you:
You got involved in a decentralized, permissionless system who's **entire purpose** was to eliminate central points of failure, centralized control, the need for trust, and corruption which comes from 1 entity having too much power
 ..... and yet you think it's rational and normal for a single corporation to be playing a role in the code that's written for it? 
Are you out of your mind? 
Am I in the fucking twilight zone?
There are other ways to fund development without creating massive conflicts of interest, and you know it.

There's so many people here who just use hardware wallets. At least there's a lot of hardware wallet shills who hang out here.

It's not a plate frame from a dealer.  It's from The Auto Firm.  They are a customs shop for customizing vehicles.  Their work is world renown (check out their Instagram - it's really impressive   They did my roof wrap, my wheels, my tint, and painted various elements of the vehicle black for me.  
The plate frame looked great when he first put it on. Really added to the aesthetic.  I didn't mind the advertisement as they're known for doing celebrity vehicles and I liked the owner.

I'm not wrong. I said nothing has happened to justify a nearly $400 price increase in 3 weeks. And that's totally accurate.
If the pump happened seven months ago, you would pick whatever news that happened the week prior, and claim that it was the reason for the price increase. 
You realize that about yourself, don't you? 
And that's why you, are wrong.
You identify "tone" in a few articles, as justification for a $400 price increase in 3 weeks?
You must be new here.
Why did the price go down when Microsoft started accepting bitcoin?
Why did the price go down when Expedia started accepting bitcoin?
Were you even here when that happened? Or are you new.
Because this ecosystem price is not moved by organic adoption yet.  It's moved by whales, speculators, and pumpers and dumpers. By China making millions off people like you who don't have an accurate grasp on the ecosystem to identify abnormalities in price changes. 
You will do yourself a service to realize that Bitcoin has a whale club and has China.  And they both push the price up, and crash the price to make money for themselves. We have not reached the point where actual organic adoption affects the price yet. 
The reason for that is simple: nobody's using bitcoin yet. Except you and me and all our buddies here. Which is barely a grain of sand on all the beaches of earth.

&amp;gt;By this pump you mean starting at 790's and getting to the 860's where we are at currently? If so yes
What?  No.  it has not been chilling at 790's.  800?   Dude it hasn't even seen $740 for the last several months.  
For the last several months it's been hovering low-mid 600's.  I don't know where you're getting your numbers from.  
In the last five days it's gone from that $650-ish up to $900.  So basically $250-300 in five days.  That's a pump. 
I realize all you newcomers are desperate for this to be "real". But you're going to find out soon enough. We can reconvene here when the price crashes. It's incredible that every single time this happens, people don't realize that fast increases ALWAYS correct.

The Fidelity Effect. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 06:44:01
To put it simply, it's about supply and demand. We are currently maintaining a $740 price with the current supply of new coins onto the market.  And the demand surrounding them.  
In 10 years the new supply will be cut down by something like 90%.  If demand is the same, you're going to be looking at tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars per coin.
The prayer is that demand **at least** stays the same as today. The reality is, unless this thing completely implodes, demand is going to be reasonably higher.
So with absolutely no change in demand, you're still looking at tens of thousands or more per coin. Imagine if demand goes significantly higher?
So what about the guy that says I'm wrong? 
Well he's making the insanely unlikely bet that hundreds of thousands of people who are invested will just let this thing die without an ounce of resistance. That people will just lay down and let it dissolve into nothing over the next 10 years.  
That, or some dystopic grandiose silliness that a decentralized currency with literally hundreds of viable clones, will somehow be squashed by every single government in the world simultaneously to the point of forced-nonexistence.
The likelihood of either of those happening is pretty much zero. Therefore: stockpile. Now.

This is a lateral move of an investment that hasn't cashed out. A five-year-old would know that.
To be frank, tough shit if they don't know where it went?  That's the nature of blockchains. It can go from one exchange to another, to a paper wallet, back onto an exchange, and can keep doing this for decades without actually being a taxable event / sale. 
Maybe a new rule needs to be made to acknowledge this reality of block chains. But to claim that it's a taxable sale is absurd.

Moving Bitcoin from an exchange to a paper wallet, or to another exchange, is not "transacting". 
Transacting is an exchange of goods. It's an exchange of something. This is not a transaction.

Paper wallets from bitaddress.org are my suggestion for brand newbies who plan to hold long term and want perfectly good offline cold storage. 
They can simply:
1)  Go to bitaddress.org
2)  Disconnect their Wifi
3)  Click Paper Wallets tab
4)  Select # of wallets to generate 
5)  Print
6)  Send funds to the public addresses. 
Free. Takes 2 minutes.  Perfectly secure.  
There are other things you can do if you actually believe that Bitcoin hackers are standing outside your front door waiting for you to hit print. But since the chances of this are 0.000001% ... this is free and secure enough. And you can send funds to those receiving addresses forever. 
Other security measures the more technically inclined can take (not absolutely necessary):
1)  Instead of using their webpage, click on the text link bottom for the GitHub Repository.  Once on that site, download the ZIP source files from there. 
2)  Use a laptop that has never been connected to the Internet, and has a fresh OS install. 
3)  Use a printer that has never been connected to the Internet, and will never be connected after you use it. 
4)  Recommended:  Click the option for BIP38 password encrypted Paper Wallets.  In this case you'll need to select a pass phrase which you will enter. If you lose this, you are toast. If you print out the non-password-protected ones (non-BIP38), they are just as secure, as long as you are the only one who ever physically sees them.  Bottom line is nobody can see the QR code nor the private key text on those.  With the BIP38 ones, you can wave them around in public all day without worry.
Again, not necessary, except for eliminating that "1" in the 0.0000001% chance there are Bitcoin ninja hackers focused entirely on you, average joe, in your parents basement in Toledo, Ohio on Mulberry street.

Let's make sure we understand our disagreement here: you are claiming this is a sustainable, long-term price. I'm claiming it's a temporary pump. Whether it's from whales, or from activity in China, I make no claims. 
You've insulted me, and talked a lot of shit, and told me I don't know what I'm talking about. 
This disagreement has nothing to do with "thinking the price is going to go up forever". Not even sure what you're talking about with that.  
At the end of the day, in my opinion, this comes down to peoples irritating propensity for screaming "organic adoption" when it's obviously a pump. But only when people start turning into dick's and acting cocky like you have.  So that's the only reason I'm calling you out right now and will call you out when the price crashes.
But let's make sure we know what we're disagreeing on here. You're claiming this is going to be our new long-term price. I'm claiming it's going to crash. You called me an idiot. We shall see.

He's not wrong.  The phase of "X is now accepting Bitcoin!" came, and went, and fizzled to a relatively disappointing conclusion.  It seems to have played no part in increasing consumer adoption nor creating incentive.  So AirBnB likely won't do a thing to further Bitcoin adoption just like Expedia didn't.  It's still nice to hear though. 
The use case for Bitcoin right now are financial services, and they're still unable to begin due to scaling limitations and feature set limitations.  Apparently SegWit etc will be facilitating at least a small kickstart for both of these things. Wish we could fast track it so Bitcoin can stay relevant.

If I'm understanding this correctly, bitcoin development grants would allow payroll for bitcoin developers so that they don't need to have massive conflicts of interest by working for centralized companies that influence the direction and priorities of the Bitcoin code.

@_date: 2016-12-10 00:33:19
NASDAQ never really ridiculed Bitcoin.  They reportedly wanted to use bitcoin in some capacity to incorporate it into their new system.  
Unfortunately they were unable to do so due to (at the time) because of Bitcoins scaling limitations and lack of flexibility to support Layer 2 services.  More importantly due to no signs that scaling and flexibility were going to be fixed anytime soon.  
Turns out they were correct as that was nearly a year and a half ago now.  No matter what your position is on the block size issue, there's a 3rd camp of people (where I feel I fit in) that simply believes the problem is development speed.  And that things should move more quickly, due to opportunity cost like this situation, and the "bitcoin fidelity effect".

@_date: 2016-12-08 20:59:42


If that's your criteria for everything, then few things in life you accept to be true can be accepted as true also.  Real life dictates that honest, reasonable judgment based on actual red flags and proper context can lead a rational person to an accurate conclusion.  
Even in the absence of "indisputable evidence".  Because in reality, sometimes indisputable evidence is unavailable. Or properly hidden. That doesn't mean that coming to conclusions based on people's actions, red flags, behaviors, and a 2 year history is somehow "invalid".  
Any rational individual can sit back for 6 months to see how things play out.  And when they play out in a manner which indicates a certain motive, that individual can start to form an opinion.  
When they wait a full year and still see inaction or avoidance, that person can rationally form a more solid opinion.   
When two+ years goes by and literally every bit of activity points to a certain end result, you'd have to be a complete idiot with your head in the sand to deny what is now commonly accepted as reality.  
And that is exactly what has happened.  Indisputable evidence or not.  Actions (or lack thereof) speak louder than anything else.

Because absolutely nothing has happened in the ecosystem in the last month to justify this rise in price.  Nothing.  Zero.  Zilch.  Nada.  
There is no new killer app.  There is no new widespread adoption going on.  The only thing going on right now that could be viewed as infulential on the price is a massive divide in the community, which should be creating uncertainty and pushing the price down.

And clearly a handful of programmers are geniuses of finance all of a sudden, right?  
So basically this decentralized system that hates authority ..... needs authority figures to decide shit for us?  Really?  
Fascinating how identical that sounds to the current government logic.  Please, save us from ourselves almighty smarter people.  
In the meantime, keep impressing all of us idiots by being unable with to make a simple fucking decision on where the protocol goes. Bickering like children for what ... two years now?  Reminds me of Congress just a tad.

I'm not talking about the buy in needed from mining groups. I'm talking about this nonsense going on here on Reddit. Miners aren't making the decisions.  Programmers are.  
The months and months of wasted time, bickering, and indecision between a handful of coders?
This portion of the process needs to be changed. 
Buy in from miners will always be the last step. But a voting system whereby literally everyone in the world can influence the outcome is needed. Something structured.

The whole point of bit coin is to ignore the opinions of its users, and allow literally a handful of developers to make all the decisions? 
Fascinating.  I wasn't aware of that.  
Then bitcoin is going to fail. Just like any other business that doesn't bother to hire product development managers, or sales people who are out in the field. People who actually know what the market needs. Programmers do not make those decisions in any business for a reason.  Anyone that has even five minutes of experience in the business world knows that you don't let developers me probably development decisions. It's incredible that you support this method when the entire thing is being proven ineffective right on the front page of this sub.

Help me out here.  Why do we believe that literally NOBODY anywhere in ANY of these companies realizes they're being sold snake oil?  My common sense meter is flying off the hook right now about this.  I fail to understand how that could even be possible. 
Surely some very intelligent, well informed people are fully aware of what they're getting and are seeing some benefit to it.  Don't tell me that they are simply being hypnotized by cool sounding buzzwords. Nobody spends 25 million on something they don't grasp. Let's have an intelligent conversation about what's really happening here. 
Sometimes it's really annoying how we can get so blind and biased on this topic that we actually believe that thousands of people with IQs higher than ours, are being sold a bill of useless goods without realizing it.  Really?  No different than QuickBooks Online?  Cmon...
I get that its centralized, and that makes us mad. I get that it's not using Bitcoin and so we won't get as rich. And I get that some of us actually believe big companies should give a shit about decentralization or bypassing trust. (Hint:  they don't). But I think it's been well-established that this can be done without Bitcoin and still save them billions of dollars.  So why are we still chanting these one-liners that make no sense?  Help me out here.

No. There's a difference between the person that writes the code, and the person that decides what the product does. If you've spent even 30 seconds working on development projects in the real world you know that programmers should not be making decisions on enhancements, features, nor timelines. 
There's a reason for that.  They are not out in the field. They have zero interaction with the people using the product. They have no awareness of what the product needs to do, nor why. They write code. They know programming languages. That is their expertise. That is why programmers write what they're told to write. They don't decide what the product does.  
Without fail, in every single development project I've managed, programmers always try to do with their own way. Overstep their bounds. Change the specifications. Or simply do things wrong. 
I understand this is an open source system. That is obviously a unique set up. However an open source system that takes no input from its users is just as doomed to fail, as a regular development project that completely ignores its product development managers.

Please ignore the vocal idiots.  We are not all antisocial dicks. 
My biggest recommendation if you can take the time, is to listen to the Lets Talk Bitcoin podcast run by Adam Levine.  They are Bitcoins most intelligent source of information with their finger on the pulse.  Listening to the weekly podcast will keep you up on the latest worthwhile topics, and present them with a perspective that I've found refreshingly responsible. 
As I recall they had a handful of other podcasts mixed in their podcast feed (like "Bitcoins and Gravy") so please look for the Lets Talk Bitcoin proper.  The one run by Adam himself.  The others are moreso entertainment.  
Im glad you asked our input.  The single most irritating thing about journalism and bitcoin right now is that they don't bother writing about what's actually going on out there. 
You will never hear about the people in Africa trying to "bank" the unbanked using Bitcoin technology and SMS. You'll never hear about the topics discussed at the latest conferences. Or humanitarian and other efforts going on around the world. You'll only hear about stuff your managers are probably asking you to write about. (The latest price swing, the fears of money laundering, the arrest of MtGox CEO, etc). 
So I can confidently say that keeping your eye on this podcast, and some of the bitcoin publications out there, will give you some extremely unique content that I think the general public needs to be aware of.
Hope this helps.

Luke, I get that. Maybe I failed to convey what I'm trying to say. You see the shit show on the front page of this sub? That's the part I'm talking about. Whatever the fuck that is? Needs to change. 
Give it whatever label you want. In my opinion? It's what happens when you let developers make all the decisions. If you don't think that's the cause? Then give it another title. But that shit show needs to go.
In the real world this shit doesn't happen with "systems" because you've got product development managers, people with degrees in finance, people who are out in the field talking to the people who will be using the product, and numerous other parties that actually know what the fuck the industry needs. 
Those are the people that decide what changes happen to the code and what enhancements get done.  And in what order. 
Developers play only one roll in the real world: they consult on technological capabilities versus limitations. That's it. And in those environments, products become successful.

Multiple PhD's in cryptography doesn't qualify somebody to create a product for a financial system. That's his point. They're coders. Not finance experts.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:43:37
He stated that the core devs (coders and engineers) should control the code of Bitcoin instead of "the managers".  I assume by managers he's making a generalized derogatory reference to people in suits, who we are supposed to dislike. Unfortunately the managers in reality, equals all of us. The entire decentralized Bitcoin community. So while his phrasing was technically incorrect, everybody took it as "devs" versus "everyone else".
My issue has always been one thing: that the people who are going to use this product get an equal say in how it gets developed, what gets added to it, and the priority of when. 
I believe that the collective expertise of everyone in the entire world who needs to use bitcoin for many different purposes, adds an intelligence to the equation that a handful of programmers could never possibly dream of incorporating.
The engineers and coders however will always be the gatekeepers for what is technically feasible, and to the philosophy and heart behind what bitcoin was made to be.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:02:34
I think he's talking about a simple vote. From someone other than a couple of programmers. Maybe like… Oh I don't know… The entire decentralized Bitcoin community?  And then of course the miners will decide if they want to support the decisions.

The block size debate was actually discussed on its own for the last 24+ months.  Nobody was making any headway.  And that's exactly why the governance tissue bubbled to the surface.  
Focusing on the block size debate by itself isn't going to suddenly help the situation.  Doing that previously lead to complete gridlock.  This begged the question of:  "Who decides what Bitcoin is, and does?"  
Figure that out, and the block size debate also gets resolved. Not sure the detriment of them being intertwined.  Nor the real value of separating them.

I've been following you around here lately LOL. You are definitely a finance guy, and you call out bullshit when you see it. It's actually nice to have someone here that knows finance, and can interject some reality into some of these conversations.
But let me play devils advocate here for a minute. You would be the guy kicking and screaming that Uber was stretching some rules to bring in a new paradigm when they first started too. 
Not saying it's ethically right or the best way to go about it, but the fact that they were able to operate so long before anybody raised any questions, meant success, and a paradigm change that now can't be stopped.
As long as no laws are being broken, situations like this require regulators to take a fresh look at things, and I think ultimately they look at the benefit to society, over some legalistic blind rule of law. At least in Uber's case that was true.

Exactly. This is why you don't have programmers (core devs or even Chinese miners) making decisions on product development. This is exactly why. Because they are not out in the field. They don't have any interaction with NASDAQ. They don't know what this product needs to be able to do. Therefore they should not be the ones holding the keys to enhancements, nor making the decisions on whether they happen. I've been saying this for months. And here's a real world case as to why.

You hit the nail on the head.  Developers do not make product development decisions.  The users do.  (Or should). 
And this is exactly what happens when coders are given too much influence over the product they are making. 
The power struggle between coders and those with actual knowledge of the bigger picture goes on in every business every day.  
As a project manager over development teams it was a constant struggle to keep coders reigned in. They always think they know better than those writ the specifications,  while simultaneously having a gross unawareness of the demographic they are creating the product for.

Did 8 months of boring prices make us forget about Bitcoins volatility issue?  People simply don't view Bitcoin as a safe haven yet.  The money they put in could lose significant percentage of its value, and I think even the least informed person knows that about Bitcoin.

"Doesn't like bitcoin as money". It's hilarious how this is such an emotional topic for finance people. It's just a currency. A programmable one at that. Maybe he doesn't like the lack of control he has over it? 
But as a currency, it's superior to every currency we've ever had. You would think smart people like bankers would recognize that? But again… emotion.

I'm not being sarcastic. Developers are not supposed be making decisions about the direction of a product. Given you arent aware of that rule, you clearly are developer, or you haven't worked in project management. Ever.
Under normal circumstances, developers do one thing: they code. They don't go out there and decide what features to add. They don't decide what comes first. The reason for that is simple. They aren't sales people. They aren't out in the field. They have absolutely no idea what this product needs to do. They write code. This is so painfully obvious to most people.
Bitcoin is the very first un-riggable voting system ever created that I'm aware of. So I don't even know what you're referring to that it would be manipulated. On the contrary. It's the first voting system that can't be manipulated.

@_date: 2015-07-23 17:16:03
Yeah that would be great. However I'm learning that bitcoin apparently was created giving developers all power over product enhancements and feature sets. 
And this is exactly why nothing is getting done.  
Unfortunately this is one of its hugest flaws. You don't let developers decide what the product does. They are not sales people, they are not marketing, they have zero interaction with anyone out in the industry. They're coders. Not product development people.

Intra-chain hits me better psychologically. I immediately thought of an internal system (versus a public, open one) that is a walled garden.

Are you sure you've been around?  Bitcoin has had at least 4 bubbles.  While they all settled slightly higher than the previous low, they all popped and crashed 80%.  It's not my opinion and there is no debate.  Go look at the charts.  
Is that all the "adoption" you're referring to?  Organic adoption is the only way to achieve sustainable price increases.  That's the topic right now. 
There are a small amount of organic adoptees (if you really want to call them that) during bubbles, but 80% of those people are hype buyers who get sucked in ....and then stuck when the price crashes.  To me, that isn't solid, organic adoption. That's speculation resulting in being trapped.

You hit the nail on the head.  But if you have been involved in product development cycles you should know exactly how developers think.  They are constantly being whipped into submission because they are constantly declaring their arrogant superiority over everyone else on projects.   Often refusing to follow specifications, being told to undo work they did without approval, being re-told to do work they didn't want to do, and being asked to de-complicate their code because it was unnecessarily complex.  Scope creep was a constant struggle because it was always the developers who didn't want to follow the specifications.  They always thought they knew better, and were always the reason we ever went over budget or timeline.  They are often miserable because they hate being told what to do. We ran into this on literally every single project.  
Sound familiar?
The open source world is a place where developers get to pretend they are the Kings.  And it often ends in disaster because when developers are in charge of everything, projects go to complete hell without leadership from someone who has the capability to incorporate input from the industry / end users / QA / and all other parties.  
Bitcoin developers are the antithesis of this, confidently and proudly declaring that everyone else is irrelevant (and stupid).  
They do it here routinely.  
In other words, everything you're seeing here should not surprise you.  Those of us who have been involved in managing project teams are fervently praying for some sort of leadership to spring up in Bitcoin that incorporates input from more than just developers.  Gavin was this sort of developer.   Hands down, without question, he understood both worlds, and was an outstanding lead dev, who current bitcoin devs have summarily spat upon and kicked out the back door.  And he continues to get character assassinated here on a weekly basis.

100% weird, human nature hyping itself up for a bubble that will pop later.  
It will be just a short-lived, irrational elation at SW succeeding somewhere on the planet, even if its not where it needs to succeed (Bitcoin), which will push the price up for literally no reason whatsoever.  And then it will come tumbling down.

And I am confused why we are fine having centralized exchanges but not fine having centralized transaction processors.  Someone was going to make a truly decentralized exchange but nobody ever did.  
The discourse going back several years has always been: "What Bitcoin itself can't do, can be added as a layer on top". Andreas Antonopoulos has always espoused this if I'm remembering correctly, even back in 2012 on the LTB podcasts.  
So people are afraid of a centralized transaction processor but not afraid of Coinbase?   Why?

Tell the marketing, sales, and product research teams to go home. Let the guy who knows how to do C++ decide how the toaster is going to operate. Then watch your company fail. 
The only entities that should be making product development decisions are the entire community via a block chain-based voting system. We have the first fraud-proof voting system right in front of our faces, and nobody's making it happen. You want truly decentralized decision-making? We can do that. But we're not. 
The fact that a large handful of core devs and Chinese miners are sitting around arguing all day is absurd. If there was anything that would be the undoing of bitcoin, this is what it will be.

I only want to be able to blame myself.

Why do you treat Satoshi like a bumbling idiot? 
Nobody's treating him like an infallible God. But if you want to make a different coin with different rules, then make a different coin. 
Why is that so hard for you folks you grasp? 
There are rules for what this coin is, and how it works.  Pretty basic common sense. This isnt about molding bitcoin into what you want it to be. There are 500 other coins you can do that with. 
You don't get to change the definition of this one because it suits you. 
Everyone knew the rules from the beginning. From Day 1.  Including you. You don't have to like them. But you don't have the right to change them.

We are literally soul brothers.  This is exactly my experience.  I sat here scratching my head for years at why Satoshi gave miners so much power. 
Not a single damn person here was the slightest bit concerned about it.  Everyone always replied with: "If you don't like it, make your own coin. This is how Satoshi designed it". 
My how times have changed.  
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:38:50
The numbers indicate that massive quantities of people and / or money has jumped ship to a particular other coin.  This can't be disputed.  There is a market share chart you can see yourself. Bitcoin is quickly approaching only 50% which is the lowest in history.  
When actual human people invest heavily in a technology, they become champions in its success.  They talk about it, promote it, and if the tech allows, they innovate on top of it.  That coin I refer to allows for this, in spades.  Bitcoin doesn't.  
My point?  Everyone needs to stop scoffing at the concept of the flippening and equating it to Dogecoins rise in 2013.  It's nothing like that.  
The narrative - from the Crypto scene... right on up to WIRED, [Motherboard]( and [Mashable]( is that bitcoin has stalled, while this new coin is about to take over. 
When it reaches this level of popularity, it begins to support itself and grow, unabated. Honestly this is why "that other sub" even exists.  Irrational, non-technical, whatever labels you want to give them, their entire premise is centered around this valid concern.

False.  There are very intelligent people who fully grasp the technology on the table, who completely disagree with you. 
Its not about you being "intelligent Science guy" and everyone else being "uninformed religious zealots".
This is about you holding a particular opinion of the facts on the table. And other people holding a different opinion. 
This arrogant mentality is what got you guys into this position in the first place. It was the years of listening to devs telling everyone that we didn't need to scale bitcoin (in their infinite wisdom) that got us into a position where a bunch of shitty alternate clients sprung up. 
It was the mentality that "technical" people know more than everyone else, and the refusal to work together with other players in this space that caused all of these problems. 
And the craziest part about all of this:  You guys simply don't like the way Bitcoin was designed. 
All this bitching and arguing? Really just comes down to that. You're trying to change the definition of bitcoin. You have no shame about it either.
So make a different coin.

There is a lot... and I mean a LOT ... of activity in India that would benefit from Bitcoin.  Companies shipping pharmaceuticals and operating in a legal gray areas doing so.  India is the  supplier of cheap pharmaceuticals to the rest of the world.  Anything you buy online practically.  They have to pay off everyone from postal employees to local FDA officials, to banks.  
Banks are the biggest problem.  Moving money around in environments like these is the bane of their existence.  
If they create a closed-loop system where they can buy, sell, ship, and bribe "off the grid", it will become a massive boost to demand and subsequently, price.  I know someone involved in this scene and he won't stop talking about Bitcoin now.  And he's not an Indian hipster in his moms basement. He's a major distributor out of that country.

Now we're screwed.  Because now there's a solution but it took them 3+ years to even admit a problem existed.  In that time, people began taking their own steps. Hearn bailed. Gavin bailed.  Some jumped ship to another coin. And everyone else started making their own clients.  
There's a reason all that even happened.  Because when people were warning that we needed to get our asses moving, nobody in Core was listening.  
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:58:13
1)  Rampant paranoia and speculation is never a rational approach.  The tinfoil hat problem is getting ridiculous around here. 
2)  Demonizing Gavin has gotten out of control.  It is LITERALLY based on nothing but 100% pure unadulterated assumption, based on ***ABSOLUTELY nothing***.  
And it directly and obviously conflicts with literally everything Gavin has ever said or done in this space, which has been 1000% focused on the well-being of bitcoin.
The only agenda I see are a group of people on this sub who are so hellbent on making non-Core implementations "look bad" that they've actually stooped to shitting all over the reputations of some of the best people in this space.   
And they will grasp at any straw possible to do so.

Disagree.  The price will increase.  Human behavior is highly predictable.

I've managed development projects for years.  
Things don't just "take time" because they take time.  Usually there's a bottleneck.  Project speed increases when there is more funding, more developers, etc. 
I believe blockstream has 80 million in investors for the sole purpose of funding Bitcoin development. Maybe they can assist? 
There's no reason things need to take a year to get coded and tested.  Extremely important things like this warrant additional resources.

Tell me why it's bad advice?  Literally tens of thousands of bitcoin veterans use paper wallets for long-term cold storage. And you're saying that's bad advice?
The day my wallet.dat file got corrupted after I had moved it across several different hard drives and then tried to import it again, I was done risking all of my money to the reliability of some third-party software, and programmers who may have left some bugs in the software they wrote. 
Why would I risk all of my money on someone else's proficiency at coding?  That's the dumbest move anyone could make.  To suggest that someone does *that*, is bad advice. 
Paper wallets give me the power over my own situation. If something goes wrong, the only one I can blame is me. Not true with core.  Or Trezor.  And I trust myself a hell of a lot more than I trust some random dude who has written some code that's going to continue to be "fixed" as bugs are found over the years.
- trust the input of someone who's been at this for years and has a lot of money riding on the storage method he's chosen.  Even Andreas Antonopoulos recommends paper wallets and safe deposit boxes.

They were too centralized before.  The proper question is:  If they weren't *disagreeing* with us, would we be calling it a problem?
I have proof that the answer is "No".  Because nobody said it was a problem for the last 8 years, until Miners started getting unruly.  Now suddenly it's a huge problem.
Now suddenly Satoshi's intended design needs to be rewritten.  And that's fine.  Rewrite it.  But people need to stop pretending this isn't the way Bitcoin was set up to work.

I know everyone thinks this is a stupid idea, but I still think there should be a voting system whereby the community decides what happens. 
Obviously developers play a role of technical advisers on what is, and isn't possible. But under no fucking circumstances should the developers be making product development decisions. 
The community decides how this goes forward. Not some Chinese miners, not Blockstream, not Gavin, not Luke, and not me. 
Decentralize the decision-making process.

A service that could provide a bitcoin wallet to merchants, and have (as part of its business model already) the ability to purchase bitcoins at market price, could easily create a magento / woo / shopify plugin that initiates a purchase for the same dollar amount at the point of sale, and deposit it into the merchants BTC wallet address.  
Bitpay currently allows BTC income to be held as BTC, or converted to Fiat and even allows you to specify what percent of the sale stays BTC or converts to fiat.  This would just be the opposite.
@_date: 2017-04-03 06:45:29


You didn't mention him, and he's not a hero of mine.


Right, because coding is the only way to contribute to Bitcoin.  This reflects the narrowminded viewpoint of the coders in this scene, and its exactly why you guys got us in this position in the first place.  You actually think what you do is the only thing that matters.  And since you guys royally messed up by ignoring your constituents, you have put Bitcoin in a precarious situation where multiple shitty clients now exist and half the community has told you to kick rocks.  Yet here you are parroting the same arrogant, ignorant, blind mentality that if someone doesn't "code" ... then they don't "contribute".
Wake up already would you?  
In the real world, coders are employees.  They arent in charge of projects.  The reason for that is simple:  They dont know anything about the market they're building the product for.  Other people do.  So while you can write lots of code - it may never get used by real human beings - and at that point - what good is your code?  You need other players in this space, or your code will collect dust.  
As it stands right now, nobody in the "lay person" world cares about bitcoin, and you guys have been coding "like the wind" for 8 years.   Did that ever strike you as odd?  This is because code means nothing without use-cases, and "business people" to create products around your code.   
My point?  There are obviously a thousand ways to help bitcoin succeed, and writing code is only one small way to do it.  An ecosystem has many important players from coders, to planners, to strategists, to marketers, to sales people, to volunteers, to artists and musicians.  Tatiana Morose has "helped" bitcoin by making music about it.  
I have "helped" bitcoin by literally canvassing the streets of Miami, San Diego, and Tijuana handing out yBitcoin magazines and talking to shop vendors.   In fact I would dare say I have done more for Bitcoin than any coder by doing that act alone, because I actually connect with real human beings who might actually USE bitcoin.  
Why don't you walk around town handing people a drive with your code on it, and see if they can do anything with it ....

Forget using core for storage.  That's insane to me.  Software breaks.  Becomes old.  Files corrupt.  Etc.   Go to bitaddress.org and create some paper wallets.

That's why I put a ? next to my comments about them being slow.

Hearn is not a hero.  I believe he "ragequitted" too.  But his reason was sound.  He felt Bitcoin was going to be ruined if steps weren't taken "back then" to expand.  I honestly don't see how anyone can fault him for that viewpoint since everyone agrees its needed.  He just said it was needed a long time ago.  Foresight?  Way too extreme of a response to his own frustration/paranoia?   Absolutely.  I was scratching my head just as much as everyone else when he announced his departure.  
Gavin is someone I respect greatly.  I read personalities and integrity.  You're an F in that regard based on the shit I've seen you do.  Gavin is an A+ in that regard based on the shit I've seen him do.  Armstrong (owner of Coinbase) strikes me as a fair, rational, intelligent businessman who wants Bitcoin to succeed.  Ver?  An eccentric.  If he says one more time that he's "The first person in the history of the world to invest in Bitcoin" i may vomit.  But as "strange" as he may be to some people, I feel I have read his personality and he is obsessed with Bitcoin succeeding.  He wants nothing bad to come to Bitcoin.  


Im starting to realize that I am engaging someone who has a poor grasp on reality.  Now I don't feel so irritated, because you've branched off to saying things that are plainly irrational.

Again - utterly false.  In the real world (outside of Bitcoin) - users are the ONLY THING that matters, with the understanding that devs advise on technical limitations.  EVERYTHING the developer does is based on previously-identified user / industry needs.  
That is EXACTLY where specifications come from in the first place.  
Developers have two jobs:  
1)  Following specifications that are created for them, after their bosses have determined user needs.
And... 
2)  Advising on technical limitations, with the goal in mind that they ***still must meet user needs*** without compromising the integrity of the system.
User needs are 1,000,000% the priority.  Hands down.
Because nobodys going to use your fucking code if it doesn't solve problems for end-users.
Do you guys even grasp that?
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:14:57
So let me understand your logic here. 
As long as bitcoin doesn't suck as bad as everything else that sucks, therefore bitcoins "doing great", no matter what. 
It doesn't matter if it's fees have gone up 80%, and it has slowed down 200%.  It still "doing great".

You ***yourself*** explicitly told me that block stream was created to provide funding to Bitcoin developers who were not otherwise getting paid.  ***You*** told me that was its innocent, harmless, and altruistic reason for being created. 
That's why I said Blockstream has no "lack of funding to hire more developers". 
What is it $50 million? 
Pretty sure you could hire a whole army of developers for that much. 
Maybe the miscommunication is in the nuance. Maybe the only developer that Blockstream ever intended to pay is you. I don't know, but please don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. 


Thank you. This is actually helpful, pertinent information.  I was simply proposing a solution to the fact that things take "up to a year" to get released. Usually more heads in the game, helps. Really quite innocent. Not sure why all the rage.

Even when someone thinks it's black-and-white, it often isn't. That's the pitfall of having a bias. 
Simply put, of course Gavin supports decentralization, and is not out to "destroy bitcoin" because he met with the CIA 8 years ago for an hour.
Dumbing yourself down to assuming such things is crazy to me. But it happens because the people become so convinced in their position that there *must* be a conspiracy to explain Gavins disagreement with them. 
It's not ever as simple as "Gavin just came to a different conclusion for a very rational reason".
So what is the explanation for Gavin?
Probably he has concluded that things people are paranoid about aren't as big of a risk as they think they are.   
It usually comes down to things that could "go either way". 
One group of people says: *"If it goes this way, it could be horrible and our world will end".*
Gavin says: *"No, if it goes that way, everything will probably still be okay, and we will have other very important benefits to enjoy because of it.  However if we stay paranoid we will miss out on some detrimental features that bitcoin needs to succeed"*
I mean I'm only guessing. I'm basing this on how human tend to act in situations like this. And random hints that this is actually the case here. 
It's not that Gavin hates decentralization, or is trying to destroy bitcoin. It's that Gavin simply came to a different conclusion than you did, and maybe isn't as paranoid about the downsides.

The argument is that the roadmap was needed 2 years ago.   If there was one, we wouldn't be in this position.
2013, 2014, 2015 people were begging for a "road map" and getting summarily ignored by the core devs.  Respectful and increasingly urgent pleas were dismissed arrogantly, over and over.  This went on for years.  
I watched this play out day after day.   Any suggestions that Bitcoin was going to soon reach capacity were mocked, dismissed, and labeled "doomsday" posts.
Im sure many of you remember this.
It was because of this that alternate clients even sprung up in the first place.  People were feeling ignored, and it was an accurate assessment as the core developers had zero interest in interacting with anyone else in the space.  
The frustration with this perceived dismissive attitude from the "technical folks", and their 100% disregard for those who were trying to build products for actual end-users is what caused this ***entire*** situation.
Other players in the space (idiots, most of you refer to them as) were trying to get Bitcoin ready *ahead of time* for when blocks would be full.  It was not until much later that SegWit was even announced, but by then, it was too late.  It had finally come, long *after* alternate clients had been gaining support. 
We are now in a gridlock because the solution came too late.  The opportunity for the dev team to act, came and went, as far as they are concerned.  "You had your chance and you were giving everyone the middle finger".  
If the devs had been more willing to even acknowledge the existence of other players in this space years ago, SegWit could've come in 2014, and Bitcoin Unlimited would not even exist right now, because we'd already be on our way to "responsible and safe" further on-chain increases. (core roadmap)
I genuinely believe this. 
Sorry if I have offended or pissed anyone off with this.  This is genuinely what I saw transpire, having read/posted in this scene daily since 2012.

Shoot. I was here five years ago telling everyone that the miners shouldn't have so much power. And everybody told me to kick rocks if I didn't like it.

It's the fact that the industry has actually found bitcoin lacking and has actually started looking elsewhere. If you're in denial about that, who's the ignorant one? 
This isnt an opinion thing. These are people who are involved in business, that are watching the industry walk away. They understand what's going on outside of the code. 
It's only the people that bury their heads in the code (and have little or no concern about the outside world) that think nothing is wrong and call everyone else stupid.

They don't take this much time.
How long is this tired excuse going to be used? I've seen systems 10 times the size of bitcoin get created in 1/10 of the amount of time, fully tested and ultimately bug free. What's your response to that? 
How many years is needed to make relatively small enhancements safely?  
Here's the disconnect: It's not about safety and conservativeness. There are other factors on the table, stopping it. Maybe it's not a conspiracy with Blockstream.  Maybe it's just a complete lack of leadership. It could be a hundred other things. 
But stop blaming it on "were just being careful".

I didn't even come close to saying that. Did you even bother to read what I wrote? 
The entire point of my post was this: doctors are too arrogant, and narrowminded, to entertain any sort of thought experiment outside of that which is accepted and promoted by the good old boys club. 
They literally claim syndromes don't even exist if they can't find a study on it.   That's not saying that natural medicine is superior to science. What are you talking about? 
As with everything, there needs to be a happy medium.  A medical doctor who knows nutrition and its role in prevention of disease?  A Doctor who looks at a list of symptoms that don't match anything he's familiar with, and instead of laughing and calling the patient a hypochondriac, toils and researches, and runs tests until he figures out what's wrong?
Those doctors simply don't exist. 
In naturopathic medicine? They're all over the place. Would that make them superior? Some may say yes. Superior to science? I never said that. Superior to asshole doctors who think they know everything, and reject people who are sick on a regular basis? 
Fuck yes. 
PS: I was not incorrect. "Intestinal permeability" is the currently PC term for the previously mocked "leaky gut". There's nothing factually inaccurate about my statement so I don't know why you felt the need to correct it.  Some doctors may accidentally blurt out the term leaky gut. Most of them have given it a new title. For the reasons I stated.
PPS:  nothing I ever say, qualifies as "silly". Definitely not on this topic.  I'm dead fucking serious.  Because there are a lot of people right now who are suffering because of the arrogance and disrespect handed out by doctors on a daily basis. This topic is dead fucking serious. As a person who has dealt with severe symptoms of unknown origin for the last three years, and been insulted and disrespected by literally every fucking doctor I've encountered, I'm completely exhausted with the way the medical system operates. It needs to be disassembled.
@_date: 2016-09-25 08:00:24
Honestly it's the weirdest "sickness".  I mean they plainly deny things that are actually occurring in real life.

It's the most creatively twisted psychology I've seen in years. 
No wonder there are so many conspiracy theories.  Its because people can't believe that this level of denial could possibly be real.  Therefore they say it must be an act.  A means to an end.

Maybe that's because the vast majority of people who would vote, cant.  They have no means to do so because bitcoin is no longer mined by the decentralized community.

@_date: 2016-09-25 16:17:41
Yes.  They'll likely do quite a few things to stay competitive.  But that's the thing.  They're already doing those things.  They have development teams that don't make excuses that 4 years is required to do something "securely". 
I've seen more new features from Banks and CC's that are reminiscent of digital currency in the last 6 months than ever before. They are moving forward quickly (and securely).
There are now ads on TV showing people paying for dinner with their cell phone and a click of a button. With no physical receipt.  And one guy pays for another from across the room, holding up his cell phone and smiling.  Adding weekend processing and staying open on Sunday's will no doubt be on the list too. 
They know what they're doing. They're intentionally blurring the lines between digital currency perks, and their archaic banking system. They actually have smart business people who know how important it is to stay competitive or die. To move quickly, or become obsolete. People won't be able to tell the difference between a Bitcoin wallet and a bank account soon, and will have even less incentive to switch to bitcoin. 
And that's the goal. 
If we don't stay ahead of the curve, we're done. Not trying to be an alarmist. Or delusional.  Or ignorant. Or any of the other labels given to viewpoints like this one.  Just repeating once again how it works in the real world.  These are things that the "CEO of Bitcoin" would be stressing in weekly company meetings, if there were one. 
We are *still* relying on our first mover advantage while opportunities pass us by and the very industry were trying to disrupt is eliminating our uniqueness. Sunday processing is on the horizon.  
**Maybe bitcoins only real value to the world will end up being: "Pressuring the banking system to improve its services".** 
Is that what we want? Because it's pretty much all were doing at this stage.

@_date: 2016-09-01 01:33:04
It's so interesting to me how finance is so similar to medicine. Both are industries ripe for disruption that are controlled by various "good old boys clubs".  Bloated and centralized.  Access and information to the public are limited and highly regulated, to the detriment of public health and finance.  
And just like in old school medicine, piece by piece I see the "establishment" realizing shit that everyone else already knows.  Has known for years.  But they are too slow moving and close-minded to entertain thought experiments, believing that their understanding of their specialty is so well-defined and permanent that any other theories are nonsense.  
15 years ago Naturopathic and Alternative medicine doctors were treating patients heavily based on a theory called "Leaky Gut" which mainstream doctors mocked them about, for decades.  Outright rejecting it as quackery and saying it doesn't exist.  Now you've got mainstream medicine, just in the last 2 years, raving about the "microbiome" and "intestinal permeability".  Its the exact same thing, but of course they gave it a new name.  Like the banks have done with "block chain".  So they wouldn't have to lend credence to people they were formerly calling idiots.
The parallels are noticeable.  Just in the sense that arrogant, bloated, old institutions are very similar, and very slow to acknowlege new concepts.  And they all need disrupting.  Dismantling in fact.
@_date: 2016-09-19 15:37:30

First, there's no need to schedule an appointment with your bank to move your Fiat to bitcoin. You just sign up on Coinbase or Circle, then initiate a purchase. They will pull it out of your bank account, and put it into a wallet on their service. 
From there you can send it anywhere you like. My personal preference is bitaddress.org paper wallets. Send a bitcoin to the receiving addresses on the paper wallets after you print them out. Then throw them into a bank safe deposit box.  
No software upgrades to worry about, no bugs to worry about, no hardware issues to worry about, and nobody to blame except myself if something goes wrong. Full control.

You are shockingly silent in response to Sammies question posed to you. 
You basically proved my point. You're arrogant. You act like nothings wrong. And you're completely unaware of what's going on outside of the code, in the "real world" (open bazaar etc). You literally just proved my point.

Unfortunately it's just another part of our potential userbase saying they're going to use other cryptos if BTC can't meet their needs. 
And honestly, the fact that they're even saying it means they're planning to do just that.  But I guess there's nothing to worry about. Another one bites the dust. But everything's fine.

I didn't say that holistic medicine always moves faster than regular medicine.  
It was an example. One of many examples where the general public is aware of health phenomena decades before regular medicine never acknowledges it. 
Multiple sclerosis is another example. For nearly 100 years standard medicine told suffers they were imagining things, because they didn't have a "published study" to refer to. Chronic fatigue syndrome was rejected by the medical system until only recently, because there were no "published studies" for them to read on it. Fibromyalgia suffers have been laughed out of doctors offices for decades, because if there's no published study, it simply doesn't exist right?  Leaky gut?  What a bunch of snake oil science!  Probiotics?  They called it snake oil.  Apple cider vinegar instead of acid blockers?  Waste of time!  
What's that future Nobel Prize winner?  No we won't allow you to publish that study proving ulcers are caused by a bacteria called H Pylori.  (Go look up how this guy was laughed out of the medical journal "good old boys club" for nearly a decade)
Bitcoin?  It's backed by nothing! 
All of these things are quickly acknowledged by alternative medicine because it's a practice that pays attention to patient symptoms and actually tries to find a cause.  Whereas old school medicine claims things don't even exist, if they don't have a study proving it.
That was the point.

No. What's getting tiring is the lack of foresight from you short term "got to make my $10 today" people. 
On the contrary, long-term savers are paying attention to the infrastructure growth, and what's actually being built on top of the blockchain. They aren't wasting their time staring the price on any given day. 
That's the difference between you and us. We look at the infrastructure. Because *the only thing that matters is the infrastructure.* 
The price can go to one dollar today, and if the suits in England are still calling London the new bitcoin hub, BitLicense, Canadian senate holding hearings to discuss it, Expedia, etc I'm not too worried. 
The real mystery here is why people like you ignore the only thing that matters. Infrastructure. What's the logic behind that? You think the price matters more than what's actually going on out in the world? Why? 
The day I start seeing businesses dropping off in large quantities, and movers and shakers giving up on their investments… that's when I start to worry. Not a day before.

You are missing something. Cutting something that is *growing in size*, into smaller pieces, does make more of something. That's my entire point. Let me know if you need another six analogies. I've already given four.  
Just because it's "one coin" doesn't mean it's limited. Especially when the value of one coin can be $1 or $10 million. That's the entire point. Saying it's limited to one coin is irrelevant at that stage.

No you don't. You have one bitcoin. That could translate into $10 million, or $1 depending on the value of one Bitcoin.  The term "limited supply" implies there's a stopping point. And there isn't. That's why it's not limited. So I'm clearly missing something here.

I see what you're saying. I guess the way it's been presented so far to me has not been clear. Technically if you have one coin and it can be worth a dollar or $1 million, it doesn't matter how many coins you have. 
But looked at from another angle… If your coin is worth two dollars, someone can't come along and make more coins at two dollars. So in that sense, a limit is relevant.

I'm a little confused about this continued assertion that the simple presence of the payment option on the site results in lower sales overall. 
Can you explain this? When Mozilla made the claim, it didn't make much sense either. What's the logic here? That people see it and think you are a criminal?
I do roughly $60,000 in sales every month, and having bitcoin as an option hasn't reduced that amount at all. 
To be completely honest, I'm not quite sure how you could assign the blame accurately in the first place. Unless you asked each and every customer that did not buy from you. Which is obviously impossible.
How do you know what the real reason is for the reduction in your sales? My sales go up and down seasonally, and based on thousands of factors I know nothing about.
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:22:17

Remind me again why there's "limited supply" of bitcoins when one bitcoin is infinitely divisible? I realize if you get in early, and you can buy a whole bitcoin, you're going to be sitting pretty in 20 years. 
But as its value goes up, it's divisibility increases. That means there's an endless supply. It just breaks down into smaller units. I don't see how that equates to limited supply. 
Theoretically one bitcoin could power the economy of the entire world. If necessary, you would just add more decimals to the protocol. 
So how is it a limited supply when it's infinitely divisible?
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:13:18

In its most proper sense would Bitcoin be viewed as an international currency (maybe a new category versus "foreign" currency) which can be invested in and traded just like fiat currencies?

I totally get that. But I can't shake this feeling in my mind that as the value of one coin increases, the relevance of claiming "limited supply" becomes moot. It really seems like it just becomes a fun talking point. 
Feel free to use a sandwich or a pizza analogy. If you've got the ability to feed 1 million people with one sandwich because it keeps growing in size, it's "limited supply" really is irrelevant. It's not limited.
I think what I'm missing here is that it becomes limited because nobody can change its value arbitrarily.
Maybe that's the key. Because somebody can't come in and say one coin is worth $100 instead of $50 on any given day, therefore it is, in effect, limited.
Limited by its market value. Maybe that's what I'm missing.
Because it's value is what decides how much purchasing power it has. And if it's Value can't be manipulated, by creating more, or arbitrarily declaring it worth more or less, then it's limitation is relevant. 
Obviously a $100 bitcoin is going to be able to do a lot less than a $1 million bitcoin. I just wish people would point out that its limitations really related to its market price. Not so much the number 21.

This is what I'm not 100% certain about. Maybe there is some scenario whereby another block chain will work. You say that the other companies may not trust IBM. But is that really any different than IBM offering a product today, that other businesses trust, co-opt, work with, or a product they sell to consumers?  Technically that's what legal agreements are for. And trust in centralized systems is pretty normal these days. Let's assume that they come up with a Blockchain that they do secure themselves. I don't think we can just assume that nobody will use it. Play devils advocate. What's worse case scenario? Something inside me still worries that this could be done. Without Bitcoin proper.

The "where was visa six years down the road" statement doesn't work in this scenario at all. 
You're dealing with a new tool (Bitcoin) launching into an established ecosystem with established competitors who've already set the bar for minimum functionality. Minimum transaction volume. 
Common sense dictates that if Bitcoin hopes to participate in this industry at all, it needs to scale to those minimums.  And quickly.  Whether or not it's current *actual* transaction volume requires it.  
I believe there's a significant amount of lost opportunity in the fact that it can't currently compete.  Right now is the evaluation phase.  Banks are examining Bitcoin and realizing it can't support their transaction volumes.  
Bitcoin is supposed to be viewed as vastly superior.  Yet it's going to remain vastly inferior (in this regard) for the next 25 years at current scaling pace. 
Banks (the ones who scoffed just a year ago) are storming forward while we sit stagnant.  These supposed enemies of Bitcoin have already cooped the technogy and declared it will be mainstream by 2020.  They aren't sitting around saying "We'll just chill for the next 50 years until Bitcoin catches up". They're making their own. 
I personally don't know who's right on the "lightning network" debate. But I will tell you one thing: as far as I can see, the lightning network is going to be the only aspect of bitcoin that can handle the volumes necessary for it to participate in this industry. If we don't like that, we need to  scale Bitcoin now. Not by 2034.
And by the way? 2034 is only when it matches Visa. That doesn't even include MasterCard. Or American Express. Discover? Or how about the entire international banking system?  
It's only going to match Visa. In 20 years. You're telling me that's fast enough?

Exactly. And correct me if I'm wrong on this: but by the time they finish pumping the block chain and figure out that the currency is a mandatory element, all coin owners are in for a ride to the moon.  If the currency really is a mandatory element of the block chain, let them build endless block chains for endless purposes. Those of us holding coins are going to benefit handsomely.

Closed loops.  In summary:  businesses can pay all their expenses in Bitcoin. 
Example:  marijuana dispensaries can't work with banks. So customers acquire bitcoin. They purchase their marijuana using bitcoin. 
The dispensary is able to purchase it's materials and services without having to cash out to USD. There's a closed loop. 
People are buying with bitcoin and businesses can pay all their expenses with bitcoin. There's no cashing out.

Fair enough.  But let's think critically about that for a second.  What centralized company on earth is going to care about permission-less or decentralized?  With a few exceptions, none.  In fact quite the opposite. Companies want security they can control, and databases that aren't necessarily accessible by the entire world. So it will be easier for them to just steal the concept and make their own. 
Then of course we all sit back and "hope" they realize they're making something that "won't work".  That's the current mentality everyone has here.  The assumption that they are all complete idiots who don't realize they're making something that will be inefficient and ineffective. Quite a huge assumption by the way… 
Assuming they actually derive some financial benefit from a block chain network of their own, this will be repeated by every company on earth.  And Bitcoin will end up the risky, unregulated, "TOR" of block chains.  And along with it a value that is negligible because real-world adoption will be negligible.  Or as you put it .... niche.  
Sound like what will play out?

So what you're saying is there's a significant number of people who don't have a clue about how important it is that we do this immediately?  
Because if we don't, we lose first mover advantage.  Network effect doesn't mean shit if this isn't handled in the next 12 months. 
And by handled I don't mean 4 MB.  Or even 8. 
It's interesting though that this actually comes down to something that programmers don't typically have knowledge of:  the arm of product development that involves knowing the market. 
And prioritizing enhancements based on that. This is a skill typically handled by product development managers who are out in the field. And they are the ones that typically tell coders what is needed.  And how urgently.

Now you guys see how impossibly hard it is to find a decent web designer. They are literally few and far between.

I probably shouldn't speak up on this. But if they don't care about trustless systems, do they really care about immutability? Am I correct in assuming the fact that Bitcoin is immutable, this is why it's trustless. Centralized services and companies rely on trust and control and centralization.  The databases they use today aren't immutable. So why would they care about the ones they use tomorrow being immutable?
In other words: in trusted, centralized systems, they just institute various forms of security to secure the data. 
That's what they've always done. I guess my point? We make a lot of assumptions here. That they care about decentralization. That they care about trustless systems. They don't. They're just trying to save a couple bucks.

2MB blocks aren't sufficient for the work being done now by institutions that want to build products on the block chain for tomorrow.  That's why I linked to the Fidelity thread. 
If we don't scale Bitcoin way past 8MB blocks in the next 6 months, Blockstream is going to end up being the only solution, because they are the only ones that will be capable of handling the transaction volume. So we can talk shit about them all we want. Companies are either going to completely bail on bitcoin and make their own block chains, or they're going to use blockstream.
What are we doing to address that? 2 MB blocks in the next six months? Please…
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:50:54
I think we all assumed that bitcoin would be gradually-adopted over several decades. But it turns out that today, major companies want to use it for their existing systems.  This is a good problem to have.
So I believe we need to stop looking at this as a "gradual" ramping up over the next 25 years. I keep mentioning this, but even the most aggressive scaling option being offered by Gavin and Mike only gets us to the equivalent of Visa volume...... by the year 2034. 
That's 20 years just to match one credit card.  
What "MB" would Fidelity need to run on the Bitcoin block chain today?  That should be our short term, first milestone for the next 6 months.

I'm familiar with the analogy. But this is about money. The Internet was freedom of information. Money is not the same as information. People don't act towards money the way they act towards a news article. Money is fragile. Gravely important. Peoples life savings. People kill for money. Commit crimes for money. Lie, cheat, and steal for money. Lives are ruined if money is mishandled.  Or defrauded. Money is a significantly different animal than the freedom for a 12-year-old to make a geocities webpage. 
The World Wide Web of Money is going to have some significant differences to the World Wide Web of Information.  And those differences should not be glossed over.  Money brings along with it concerns that the Internet never had and companies dealing in it never had to deal with that make the Internet analogy seem downright silly.

Deduce.  Maybe they are providing access to B2B services that all accept Bitcoin. Maybe getting major companies on board that are the *payees* from service based companies. Electric, Industrial, Sewage, Commercial Office space, raw materials, etc.  Creating a closed-loop Bitcoin ecosystem in the B2B world.  Then all a company has to do is advertise they're accepting Bitcoin and suddenly merchant adoption doesn't put downward pressure on the price.  
It's always been the holy grail to have a business model that never has to cash out. To be able to conduct all your business, except all your payments, and pay all your expenses in Bitcoin. Maybe they're finding ways to provide that for numerous industries. I can't imagine how. But that would be a closed loop system that doesn't require cashing out like he's mentioning.

I'm a little confused about something. If this is a lawsuit against BFL, wouldn't be up to the Bitcointalk users to give permission to release their messages? 
The only party that should have their rights violated, is the company being investigated.  They can't just start going into random peoples inboxes and start taking PMs out, without permission. 
If these people want to be involved in that capacity, to try and get some money back, they should be asked politely if they want their PMs to be included in the lawsuit.
What am I missing here? It's almost sounds like they're just using an excuse to get a large quantity of private messages for any other "investigative" purposes they may have, unrelated to BFL.
If there's a lawsuit pending against a corrupt company, you don't go digging through victims mailboxes at the end of their driveways in the middle of the night, do you?

That was exactly my point. There are a lot of half assed shitty conferences going on everywhere. We were having one once a month for a while there.

And taking money to put a paycoin banner all over the Clevelander Hotel wall. 
I realize you guys think everything can be done by the free market. But none of you seem to acknowledge that the free market sometimes results in a shit ton of fraud. And a lot of wasted time and a lot of disappointing efforts.

Isolated incidents.  Not commonplace.  Granted it's a big enough concern for you to not prefer it.  Me too. But it's not so bad that the world in general cares. Otherwise there would be an uproar about it daily. As it stands nobody gives a shit.  So we have to acknowledge that this is the mentality... and therefore insufficient incentive for them to make major changes just because of that.  
The topic here is whether they know they need an urgent overhaul of security.  They don't.  And that's what matters.  They will secure their new systems the same way they've secured their old ones. Sorta food and sorta half assed.  Because as far as they're concerned it's just fine. They don't care what you or I think.

It means the value it dropped from wasn't real in the first place.  This has been well-established. Bitcoin never hit $1,000 organically.  It has been on a steady incline from $60 to $250 for the last 3 years.   
MtGox was not a legitimate adoption / speculation event.  And therefore this supposed "massive loss in value" should not be considered such. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 14:45:47

But hey, what's the rush, right guys? Even with the most aggressive scaling option on the table we're not going to match Visas transaction speeds until the year 2034. 
This article talks about major banks saying block chain technology will be dominating by 2020. Yet we're going to kick back and relax till 2034 before we match Visa? The logic always seems to be: "We don't need it right now, so we'll build it later".
Once again I'd like to put in my vote for getting shit working now. So systems can be built *now* that are used in 10 years.

Here's a thought: if Bitcoin is so unable to evolve at a rational speed, then maybe something else *should* replace it. This "fear" shouldn't even be on the table. If this thing was done correctly, it should scale at a reasonable pace. Not 25 years just to hit a block size limit that matches one Credit card. 
I understand that the system is such that people are terrified to change it. But doesn't that say something about the system?  (that's a rhetorical question. The answer is yes).

I am in the same position as you with merchant fees. However through shopify you are now getting almost the lowest merchant fees anywhere on the Internet. So that's good.

How do you source an attitude?
How about a source that shows declining interest in Bitcoin  versus the inability of a specific business to secure funding?
The latter is exactly what happened. 
Source:  they're closing down due to failure to secure funding. 
It's cute that they throw Bitcoin under the bus to distract from their failed business model.  As I understand it they were funded to tackle remittances.  Not just putz around as yet another online exchange.  When they were approached to enter the remittances market they showed no interest and little knowledge of the process. People have remarked that they were disinterested and extremely arrogant. 
Part of me honestly wonder if this wasn't just another "let's start a business, get a million dollars, then bail" situation. Kudos for blaming Bitcoin though guys.

To pay attention to the industry. The infrastructure. And then bail before anybody else does. If it comes to that. Which I don't think it will.

The regulations aren't an "attack".  They're a reaction to the shit show *we* created in this "wild west" community.  More importantly, they exist because it's new.  And it's related to money.  And new scary things get over regulated.  Especially when money is involved. 
The regulations will be relaxed as fewer idiots are running major exchanges causing losses in the hundreds of millions. And as fewer scammers are able to operate in this space *because* regulations now exist. 
We bring on this crap ourselves much of the time.  Everyone screams "free market" ... but look what happened when anarchy reigned.  Thefts.  Scams.  And constant fear for all involved.  In a trustless system - nobody knew who to trust.  Ironic wasn't it?  The players in this space showing that human nature is apparently all about ripping each other off - has played an important role in the over-reaction we are getting from regulators.  Don't kid yourself and think otherwise.  
When Bitcoin becomes more recognized and common, and as more people understand its nature, it will become less scary.  With fewer "unknowns".  It will be cooped into legitimate institutions (assuming we can address the Fidelity Effect problem quickly enough) and regulations will be relaxed.

You need both or this protocol goes nowhere. 
It is *absolutely* accurate to state that the protocol needs to be built in a way that is structured properly for products and services to **meet end-user needs**.  
There literally is nothing more important than this, and its influence goes all the way back to the development stage. That was his point. And it is 1000% accurate.
Bitcoin development should not be operating in a vacuum, actively and enthusiastically rejecting any input or influence from outside, non-development sources. That's suicide. To put it bluntly.

I guess I still don't see how that could be possible. The person is there to purchase something. They're not going to just walk away and not buy something because there's more options to pay with. It doesn't make any sense. 
There may be some other environments where too many choices causes people not to choose. But if they're trying to buy something online, I see no logic supporting this theory. My sales went up when I added PayPal as a payment option.
It would make far more sense to me that people are bailing because they think a company associated with bitcoin might be involved in shady practices.

Here's why the sandwich analogy doesn't work:
If you divide up that sandwich, and each smaller division is capable of feeding 1 million people, because the sandwich is getting bigger and bigger… then your "limited supply" of 1 sandwich is irrelevant.  
**Standing up and declaring "we only have one sandwich!" becomes completely irrelevant.** In fact it's not a limited supply at all because it can morph into something massive that feeds millions.
As the value of Bitcoin increases, each of its subdivisions are going to cover more and more goods or services. Therefore there's no reason to say there's a limited supply. 
If one bitcoin could theoretically run the economy of the entire world, that's not a "limited supply".  Technically it's limited because it's one coin. **But if one coin is worth $40 trillion, then it's an illusion to say "we have a limited supply".**
It's adapting to "do more".  The fact that it can morph, and change to cover more and more financial transactions with the exact same unit, means only that this unit of account has morphing capabilities. It's "limit" is not relevant. 
Therefore the concept of a limited supply of bitcoins is really just semantics. It's just a talking point. 
One bitcoin could be worth $10 million or just one dollar. You could buy 100 gumballs, or 100 houses. The relevance of it being limited at that stage, is nonexistent.
**The only place where limited bitcoin supply is relevant, is to people like you and I who have purchased one whole bitcoin.** but only because we get to feel good about the fact that we have one whole unit of something. It's just a talking point again. And we're going to be sitting pretty in 20 years. But it's limited supply isn't going to matter functionally at that stage. Because our 1 bitcoin could cover a massive amount of financial exchanges.
The sandwich analogy therefore does not work. Because in that analogy, your limited "1 sandwich" would become the size of Texas.

Because it's taking so fucking long, and bills need to be paid. To be completely honest I wasn't expecting us to be struggling to break the 600s five years later. But there's still no real life use cases for bitcoin due to capacity issues etc. 
I know, down vote me or whatever. But I'm just being honest. The reality is that a shit ton of opportunities have come and gone for us in this industry.  Several major companies that wanted to use bitcoin as their backbone have come and gone. And that's why were not significantly higher right now.

Nobody is disagreeing with you. If you look at the other conversations in this thread, it's all about the layer on top. 
But here's the problem: who's doing it? Nobody? Where is the VC funding and all the start ups that are supposed to be building these layers on top? Nobody's doing it. Except lightning network. 
So as we've said in the other conversations, there's a big assumption being made here. That anyone's going to even bother. We're seven years in. Where's the growth and the start ups? Where are all the sidechain projects? The concept of sidechains was introduced a year and a half ago. Do we even have *one* yet? This is the concern. 
Whether it gets built into the protocol itself, or built in a layer on top isn't as important as… is anyone building anything at all?

It's easy to get.  
But if someone new funds a wallet and then attempts to send money to my Bitcoin address while checking out on my store, the amount does not match and the sale fails.  
What they are supposed to send is the absurd 0.384839274 BTC amount so it's exactly correct.  
They don't.  Like any normal person they send $17.56 USD.  
They don't know they have to click USD to make it toggle to BTC on the circle site.  So they send $17.56 and due to exchange rate differences it arrives as a slightly different BTC amount.  And the sale fails.  
Has happened at least 20 times on my store so we gave up on trying to get new people into the ecosystem by offering discounts.

I think what you are describing is something that will happen around the time of the halving. I do believe long-term, the average price is going to be higher because of the overall decrease in supply an increase in demand.

The core developers doing something might be a little bit shady. But where are all the other entrepreneurs and innovators? This is my concern right now for bitcoin. 
But it seems like your concern is that it's not scaling on the protocol itself.  You did just say the protocol should be made faster.  So you promote the protocol itself speeding up. But for all the extensibility, you support centralized services on the layer above?

Do you actually believe that the protocol plays no role in the end-user experience? The protocol is the very thing which sets the foundation / limitations for what the end-user products (WALLETS) are even capable of doing in the first place. 
That's the exact reason why he said you start with the end-users and you move backwards towards the code. It doesn't matter if the code is a protocol. The concept is still the same.
If the protocol does not support scaling, and the necessary features and functionality that the products and services need for end-users, then the protocol becomes the roadblock to whether the "products" succeed. 
The code of a product is not the product.  But it defines what the product can do.  Likewise, the protocol needs to ultimately allow for functionality that meets user needs downstream.

It's too bad the "ethos" is so incredibly impossible for anyone on planet earth to use, because it's so incredibly user unfriendly.  And this is exactly why centralize services like coinbase thrive. So while I support the ethos, I'm also fully aware that no one on planet earth can function with its interface.

You're cherry picking timespans.  Your arguments are so weak that even a dummy like me immediately sees the holes in nearly everything you say.  It's incredible.  
So he points out the performance of the dollar over its entire lifespan.  
You reply by pointing out one isolated drop in bitcoins lifespan based on an artificial price spike powered by bots who landed their owner in prison. 
You're fully aware that wasn't an organic value increase.  Therefore not a valid price to point to.  
Nor does it represent Bitcoins entire lifespan.  
Intelligent people compare apples to apples.  
If you compared the entire life of the dollar versus Bitcoins entire life from day 1 to current, it's obvious which has performed better.  
It's interesting how the things you actually *do* choose to say, actually negate your own points, nearly every time.

This is an important, albeit maybe obvious tip for situations like this: I almost lost a huge chunk of coins because when I typed in my passphrase, the keyboard I used didn't register the shift key to capitalize a letter. And I had no idea because it was going in as asterisks.  When I went to access those coins, it said invalid password. 
So I simply went through the password, which I knew was correct, and tried every alternate case for each letter. It took a while, but it worked. Maybe a first approach for some folks.

Well they got half of their wish.  2013 was an artificial pump followed by a crash.  
So was this.  
As a general rule, organic adoption doesn't result in price increases of a hundred dollars in one day.  
When that happens, it should be assumed that it won't be sustainable.  Whereas organic adoption is sustainable.  How that logic could garner 21 downvotes is strange.  But I love you guys anyway.

It's not going to get fixed when you only have coders managing the whole project from start to finish.  That was my point.  They write code. They do not concern themselves with end-user needs or understanding the market for which they build.  Bitcoin *can* be many many many things.  It's just not being those things because it's feature set is being limited by those who don't concern themselves with the people who wish to use it.

I don't believe this was a result of any world events causing increased adoption of Bitcoin in the first place. So I don't believe any debt bubbles bursting are going to affect the price the way it's been going. 
I believe this entire thing was a pump. And they just discontinued the pump so now we slowly deflate. They may continue pumping again for all I know.

I see why they call you a troll now.   You literally ignore points that prove you wrong and reply with silly illogical statements that are full of obvious holes.  


Why would I do that?  It has no relevance or meaning. The conversation was based on the entire lifetime of the monetary systems. That's where the comparison was drawn to make the point. 


So if it doesn't support your bias, you pretend it's a irrelevant and say "So?".   But you harp on truly irrelevant things like an imaginary price spike, to justify your claim that the value has dropped. 
Fascinating violation of common sense and logic.
In general, someone incapable of acknowledging the pluses and minuses of something, is approaching that topic with irrationality.  These types of individuals often by break important rules when it's convenient, to defend their bias.  I see it in nearly every comment you make.  And I've made a concerted effort not to myself.  So my need for intelligent conversation is lost here. 
That, or you just don't reply.

Agreed. This was just one use case. One idea. Obviously the most simple use case is somebody walking around, and showing homeless people how to set up their own receiving address. And printing out QR codes for them, without expecting anything in return. 
The problem is, until there's some sort of offramp for these folks, there's no way for them to spend that money. They're going to have a bunch of bitcoin in a wallet, and no way to buy their heroin or hamburgers with it. 
But yes. Ultimately, nobody needs (for example) BitPay to accept Bitcoin in their store. But there are additional services provided that make it easier, faster, better by using BitPay. 
I guess lately I'm just feeling like there's really not a lot of entrepreneurs doing a lot of things with bitcoin. This example might've gotten an entrepreneur thinking about a product or service they could provide to meet this need. Shit… there could be literally hundreds of these types of products and services using bitcoin. But nobody's doing anything.

Using Colored Coins and BitTorrent to awkwardly hack together extended capabilities on a layer above the block chain. 
How many of these "upper layer" services are there in the bitcoin space right now? Two? Shouldn't there be hundreds at this point?
This is where the innovation needs to be happening in the bitcoin space. Products and services on the layer above. I'm just not seeing it happen and that concerns me.  
Colored coins has been around for three+ years. MasterCoin was around and now it's gone. Counterparty was this incredible innovation, but I don't see anyone using it. 
Instead everyone's making their own block chain entirely. We need to get the innovation going on the layer above bitcoin. Products. Services. Ideas. Entrepreneurs. Start ups.

Can you clarify what you mean? I read your sentence 10 times and I'm not totally sure what you are saying. I would love for it all to be running on the protocol itself. But there's no fucking way. The developers can't decide on anything. Plus I guess it's not really their fault. It's too dangerous to keep modifying and adding enhancements to something so fragile. So everything has to be on the layer on top.
@_date: 2015-11-17 03:07:03
I fear that will never happen.  It's simply not in their business model and too many elements of Bitcoins identity directly conflict with their business model. 
The closest I think we will ever see to something like this, is when major companies start building on the layer above the Bitcoin protocol. Then you may start seeing banks teaming up with them.  
Companies that have built a reputation for reliability, stability, honesty, and all those other silly centralized traits. 
/s There's no way they're going to hook directly into the Wild West however. 
The real question is, when is the wave of killer app centralized services being built on top of the block chain coming? It can't come soon enough…

Sorry.  I don't intend to come across whiny.  From my viewpoint I feel that I'm raising some relevant concerns. And to be honest, I only do this to get the conversation going. Or keep the conversation going. I want people thinking. Reacting. And aware of the elephant in the room constantly. In my experience, that's a good way to keep things moving forward.  From what I understand there's a lot of discussion, and not a lot of solutions. So if there's a little bit of pressure to constantly revisit the elephants in the room, it seems like it could be a good thing. I appreciate the thoughtful responses either way. This is a learning process for me as well.

More likely it's whales / bots causing both. I find it fascinating that people still think these 5,000-20,000 BTC sell orders followed by 5,000-20,000 BTC buy orders a few days later are "organic market activity in response to the latest news". 
While this ecosystem is still incredibly tiny, coordinated groups of traders are going to sway the price very easily. I have seen groups of coordinated manipulators announce the timing of their pumps with good news to make it look legit. And time their dumps with bad news. Or, when there has been no news for a while.

It's not irrational to want Bitcoin to work as designed, especially if doing so is completely feasible.  
It should not make anyone "angry" to hear people directly quote Satoshi when decisions are being made about what core tenets to keep, or toss out.  
To be completely honest, the fact that people get "angry" when the White Paper and Satoshi are mentioned, seems  totally backwards and twisted to me. 
If you had said this would be the state of bitcoin four years ago, everyone would've been horrified.  
I fully understand that there are new challenges, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the very title of the White Paper needs to be red-lined like I see happening.

The biggest threat to the success of bitcoin is the complete lack of products and services being built on the layer above. The thing that kept me assured of Bitcoins future has always been the continued growth of the infrastructure around it.  I'm not seeing that anymore.  MasterCoin is gone.  Colored COins and Counterparty aren't doing anything to get the ball rolling.  And ... well ... thats it.  Aside from maybe BitWage, BitPay and Coinbase/Circle.
Unless lightning network singlehandedly is able to usher in an entirely new financial industry of products and services on the layer above Bitcoin, there's a reason to be concerned. And even if they facilitate that, if there aren't innovators, entrepreneurs, and start ups actually building something, Bitcoin is going nowhere.

To clarify, I meant its reputation was not based on performance as a tool that has achieved any level of widespread adoption.  It hasn't "performed" in that regard.  Its still being used by a microscopic minority of the human population.  So referencing its "reputation" is fun (I have a Bitcoin license plate AND bumper sticker) ... but when you actually think about it - we're now 8 years in and NONE of your friends use it for anything on a day to day basis.  Nobody does.

I think what they are alluding to is that all these other projects are really kind of a hodgepodge of personalized experiments. They're literally dropping 70% of the elements of bitcoin and creating their own little weird bubblegum/dental floss distributed database. 
It's almost like one would probably look nothing like the other. And even if they are similar, they're not really anything like bitcoin. Not to mention these are just internal projects for banks. So why make a logo for them. 
Understand what you're saying. To differentiate it from bitcoin. But I don't think anyone's here is going to want to give it any legitimacy. To be completely honest they shouldn't even be using the term block chain in the first place. They're not building block chains. I think what's going on right now is a bunch of banks trying to come up with a new way to (i.e.) "make webpages".  Hard to put a logo to that.

Hi Peter! Thanks for keeping things moving forward. Do you think if you guys had more dedicated developers, things would move more quickly? I realize the nature of the beast is to be slow and careful. But if you had a larger team? 
I suppose that's what Lighthouse was supposed to be. But shit… I'd be happy with a GoFundMe just to raise money to pay for more core developers. Clearly I don't know the first thing about a open source development, but my understanding is that everyone everywhere can contribute.

It's not like there's an alternative option. If everyone paid "everywhere" with bitcoin directly, the network couldn't support it.  So services need to be built on the layer above.

Human psychology 101 teaches that when there's a group of people, there's going to be 100 different opinions on something.  Nobody is going to agree on anything. 
That's why voting systems were created. 
To force a decision. And keep progress moving forward. 
Majority rules, and everyone else just has to be quiet. 
Not referring to miners voting. I'm referring to all the other decisions that need to be made to keep things moving forward.

I don't claim to have all the answers, but can you clarify why building products and services, even centralized ones, on the layer above the protocol, is bad? 
You just established in your own post that there's no way Bitcoin can ever scale and be flexible enough to handle financial industry needs.
Therefore we must build on the layer above bitcoin with products and services that latch into the protocol. Or Bitcoin dies. If you think about it, Bitcoin will never be anything, without that approach. 
The problem is not that blockstream exists. The problem is that there isnt 100 other companies being built on top of the protocol at the same time to compete with them.  Where is all the innovation? Where's the infrastructure? We can't live on circle/bit pay/Coinbase forever.

It's funny isn't it?  Everyone needs to finally realize that it's services on the layer above the protocol like Coinbase that are needed in order for Bitcoin to ever become more than what it is.  
The protocol itself will never be able to duplicate the feature set needed to usher in a new finance industry.  Fortunately the free market will allow for competition on the layer above.  But Bitcoin would still be little more than a joke in the eyes of the world if it weren't for services like Coinbase.  
@_date: 2015-11-02 01:46:24
I definitely think that's probably what it is. Basically the customer can send $2.70, and $2.70 is what I get. And maybe they just handle the difference in the BTC exchange rate on the back end. 
This is what everybody should be doing in the first place. And if this is what they are doing then I'm going to switch from bitpay to them.  There's no reason why these online store plug-ins should require people to send amounts in BTC.
I ran the promo for at least six months. It's just too difficult for people to use. Bottom line.

They should be approaching the services that provide extendibility to Bitcoin on the layer above.  Not blockchain.info.  
The bitcoin protocol itself may never really be fast enough or feature-filled enough to address the needs of major financial industries. The innovation in Bitcoin needs to be on the layer above. But I'm not seeing any companies doing this.  I guess it's just Colored Coins and Counterparty?  
There could be an entire industry of innovation, competition, and scaling happening on the layer above the protocol right now.  Where is it?  This is now my biggest concern for the future of bitcoin. 
It would be amazing if the protocol itself could be adjusted to enable a whole world of financial "apps" that could be built on top.  Just like the iPhone's App Store transformed basic cell phones.  
Is the protocol enabled for that?  I posed this question to the developers yesterday and got nothing but crickets. I hope this is the direction we are going with the protocol. And I hope entrepreneurs and innovators start building products and services on top of the protocol soon. Or bitcoin may become a thing of the past.

The plus side is we have reason to believe we'll hit $1,200 again, and this time smart people will pull out in time to make some great money off of it.  
The down side is that bitcoin may have another two years of news people saying that Bitcoin is too volatile, and that its "lost most of its value".  Because if this is true, its just a bot pump again with fake volumes, and it will come back to $250-300 after a long deflation, just like last time.

How is bitcoin going to "address the current financial system problems" when the core developers have already admitted that the protocol itself will never be flexible enough, feature rich enough, or fast enough to do that?
This is the elephant in the room right now. And anytime I hear someone say that bitcoins going to do this or that, and change the world, I'm going to start asking… How?
The protocol can't do it.  And I'm not just talking about block size or speed. I'm talking about capabilities, flexibility. Extensibility. Features. Enhancements. They're not in the pipeline.
So how's it going to reproduce, or make obsolete the thousands of financial services and the current financial system? How?

You are kind of asking two different questions. The separation between bitcoin and block chain right now is in reference to mostly banks. Creating their own decentralized ledger system and calling it "the block chain instead of bitcoin". 
The other version of your question is the whole world of copycats. People who've made other currencies that require mining. And in that sense - it's all about network effect. Plenty have tried. Literally hundreds. And all of them are failing. It's heavily influenced by human psychology and social/group behaviors. I would say there's one other similar system that may have some legs to it. And that would be Ethereum.  But only because it's feature set is so astronomically more impressive. Of course it has its downsides.
So when we talk about bitcoin versus block chain, at least as far as pop-culture goes right now, we're talking about heavily modified versions of bitcoin being created by banks. Versus bitcoin itself.

The actual TLDR is this:  


And I'm not so sure that's an accurate statement?  
Besides.  They're still hired to build a product the bank wants.  The implication that they're going to secretly usurp their bosses orders and build something on the Bitcoin block chain instead, is of course false.  
So even if it were true that banks are hiring bitcoin enthusiasts to build their networks, exactly how does that mean "The fight is over"?  If the fight were over they'd be hired to build on bitcoins block chain.

@_date: 2015-11-11 06:40:39
Volatile has two meanings here.  You are saying anything that goes up and down is volatile.  And you're right.  But I am being more specific.  
The implication is that volatility is some inherent trait of Bitcoin and block chain based systems.  Some trait of Bitcoin itself.  Some aspect of what Bitcoin is as a currency.  And therefore bitcoin is useless as a currency or a store of value.
But it's not.  The volatility we see has nothing to do with Bitcoin as a currency.    
Because if certain individuals were not manipulating this tiny market, Bitcoin wouldn't be called a volatile currency in the first place.  Therefore volatility is not a trait of block chain systems.  And therefore anyone who claims bitcoin can't be a currency, or a store of value, is incorrect. This is just a small network that happens to have whales coordinating pumps. 
To me those are two different things. Volatility due to the nature of a block chain system, versus volatility because of artificial manipulation by opportunists.  One is Bitcoin. The other isn't.  Even though both are aptly referred to as volatility.

I know this is the opposite of what you just asked for, but I'm a merchant that uses stripe, and uses bitpay for the bitcoin portion instead. However the plug-in I have is rickety and was barely hacked into place by their developers. So I may just switch to stripe, considering bitpay is no longer free.
I found out the hard way that new users won't switch to adding bitcoin during Checkout even if you offer discounts. Because they have to purchase it on an exchange, and when they try to send it to your store, it doesn't match the dollar value due to exchange differences.
 Is what you are describing supposed to address this concern somehow?

There are two different definitions of demand at play here. One is the one you're using and all the developers are using. Passive transaction volume. The other is the real demand.

Wrong.  
Bitcoin is not limited to "digital gold".  
Bitcoin is a ***"Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System"***
[Read the fucking white paper](  In fact, read the very Title of it.
And the first sentence:  
*"Commerce on the Internet..."*
When did you decide that you get to change the definition of Bitcoin?
You guys wonder why the other sub focuses on (conspiracy?) theories about banks and major corps trying to "change Bitcoin" into something that won't threaten their control over the monetary system.  Stuff like ... oh I dont know .... blatantly and unapologetically changing the entire definition/purpose of Bitcoin might lead some people to think that way.
This twlight zone nonsense wont last.
After the scaling issue gets resolved the first thing you're going to see is Bitcoin being used for commerce.   In fact the entire reason Bitcoins price is skyrocketing right now is because Japan has adopted it for stupid shit like "buying coffee".

What will you do when, in 20 years, Bitcoin is still here, and has matured into something perfectly viable?   
After all, it's always being developed and modified, and it's industry and landscape continues to evolve.  
Do you think your words today will have any impact on that?  
If not, will you feel like you'd wasted your time or that you were wrong?  
I already know the answer. You're very much like Trump supporters.  Or former Obama haters.  They said he was going to "Destroy America". 
And when he didn't, you ask them why. Guess what they say? There's always a copout. There's always a canned response in hindsight right? 
"Well he would've destroyed America if the Republicans hadn't blocked him the whole time!".
The moral of the story? You're probably wasting your time. And you're never going to admit that. Even when this thing is going strong 20 years from now and everything you predicted didn't come to pass.
That would make me sad if I was you. To have that level of  unawareness of my own reality.  
Then again much of life is wasted time for entertainment sake. In that case I would challenge you to be aware of all the people that could benefit from this technology and all the suffering in the world that could be alleviated, and ask yourself why you'd want to be on the opposing side of that. Naturally you will say there is no such benefit. But I think you know what I'm referring to.

Exactly.  The code is the foundational layer for the user experience.  Everything that comes downstream, hinges on whether the protocol can support it.
That's why when you build something that you actually want human beings to use, you start with end-user needs, and work backwards toward the code. 
If the protocol doesn't allow for the flexibility or feature-set to support what the users actually want, **the product will never get used**.

They're building something that's going to save them billions of dollars. And it would behoove us to stop discussing our ideology and start acknowledging reality. Because we're dealing with an industry that is trying to save itself money. And this constant circle jerk of us telling each other that what they're building is useless and a waste of time, is completely false. And it drives me fucking nuts because we're not addressing what really matters. Numbers. How their centralized version is going to be faster, and better than what we've got.

PS:   "I want it now!" would've applied maybe 24 months post-white-paper.   Seven years after the fact?   Please.  
They say "internet time" moves what… 10 times faster than regular innovation?  I clearly remember in 2013 repeatedly hearing the new mantra that Bitcoin moves 3x faster than internet time.  
How's that coming along now?  It's common knowledge in tech circles that you need to stay ahead of the curve if you want to avoid being replaced or made obsolete. Yet this common knowledge is ignored here, in exchange for snarky apathetic YouTube links making fun of the concept as being "impatient".  
If you want to compete in a marketplace you better keep shit moving forward.  And fast.  Proof of that is now all around us as Bitcoin gets ignored and other options are gaining popularity.  While guys like yourself chuckle and tell people they're being impatient.  
It's painfully obvious that nobody in charge of coding understands the timeline issues with product development lifecycles. But that's why product experts are usually in charge of setting timelines, enhancement lists, and priorities.  Not coders. 
Ignore the advice.  Your choice. I only raise this issue (repeatedly) because I want to light a fire under people's butts and convey the need to get things moving.  I'm on your team 100%.  But my better judgement tells me opportunities are passing us by to the detriment of Bitcoins future.

I realize the scaling issue is being discussed. But it's a little bit weird to me that the lightning network "gets" the fact that the system has to scale immediately to large volumes, but the folks supporting the opposing viewpoint, don't seem to get that.
That's the disconnect I was presenting. 
One party understands that we need visa level transaction volume capability now. The other party seems to think we don't need it for 20 years. 
Considering both want to scale bitcoin, why is there such a disconnect between when it needs to happen?  
@_date: 2015-10-31 23:52:27
Agree. The problem is, there's nobody organizing anything. When you have no central entity, nobody's in charge of the timeline. Nobody's standing there going "Guys we need to get some products in the pipeline now, for release January 1, 2016". 
I think open-source probably works great for things like vBulletin, or OScommerce. But I'm not so sure that having absolutely zero central entity managing the project is going to work for something like this.  
I fear that it's just going to continue to flounder for another seven years. So is there anyone organizing and constructing a sidechains thing right now?

@_date: 2015-11-09 22:42:08
I've been pretty hard-core on bitching about how slow bitcoin is scaling development-wise. I don't know how long you've been in this space. But there was a good four years where everybody just understood that Bitcoin was going to scale on the layers above the protocol. I had totally forgotten that. But that was how it was going to work. That's why MasterCoin was created. Counterparty. Colored Coins. All the competition and decentralization was happening on the layer above the protocol. And that was completely fine with everyone as far as I could remember. 
It was only recently the people started saying the actual protocol itself needed to expand. Maybe it's because all those services ended up being failed experiments. I don't know. Maybe they never went out in the industry selling their product *to* the industry, so nobody in the industry realized they can build on top of the block chain using those services. 
I don't know what the problem is with that. You would think these companies would have sales and marketing teams to get out there and sell their shit. Imagine if they had all started garnering new business. Wed have tons of companies building on top of the block chain today. These things started two years ago. Where are they now?
Anyways, it's weird to me that the conversation has changed so much. From everyone just understanding that the protocol is the protocol, and you can build on top of it. To demanding that the protocol itself be drastically changed. Just some thoughts.

And more importantly, how in the fuck's sake could this just start on a dime if it's all legitimate across all exchanges?
There's a big difference between a bunch of people riding the wave and doing trades along the way, versus the actual initiator of the wave. The sustainer of the wave. Does that make any sense?
So the implication here is that everyone across all the exchanges just randomly decided to start competing for higher and higher prices? It seems far too staged. Far too sudden. To be legit.

Again, only you and I care about decentralization or trustlessness.  Every single company on earth interacts with other companies based on trust, and with the enforcement of legal contracts. Centralization and trust is how the world works. I'm not saying it should stay that way. But I am saying that it's ridiculous for us to assume that their solution won't work just because it involves trust. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:22:06

Pretty sure OP doesn't need to carry more than $10,000 across international borders for spendin' cash so a wallet app on his phone would be sufficient, or a simple paper wallet folded up somewhere would work just fine.

So your thinking is, "Why bother doing it because it's hard". 
Fortunately most people don't think that way. There's plenty of closed loop systems in the world. That's why the term exists. So it's very possible. It would take time. Planning. And participation. But it's very possible. 
More importantly, if they need to pull out cash, they can pull out that small percentage. Wouldn't be an issue. The issue is pulling out hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash from BTC. That could be handled via a closed loop system where they don't need to cash out.

It's not relevant because it wasn't real.  Can't believe people still disagree on this as if it's a "thing".  Bitcoin has gone from $100 to $250 over the last 3 years.  A nice smooth gradual incline.  Period.

We have to understand something though:   The philosophy that Bitcoin should remain as-is (aside from some minor block size increases to support the Lightning Network etc) makes one huge assumption.  That there will be a massive growth in the industry which creates services on "the layer above".  
If that doesn't pan out, Bitcoin itself goes nowhere.  Things were looking up with all the VC funding over the last year.  But none of them were services which created side chains or increased transaction volumes.  To date there are still no freaking side chain projects (!!) even though we are completely relying on them to keep Bitcoin more than a mere novelty. 
Now, VC funding has slowed and is getting poured into alternative systems that will be capable of supporting high transaction volumes.  And proprietary block chains.  KimDC was saying Bitcoin, now he's saying block chain. NASDAQ was saying Bitcoin.  Now they're gone.  Fidelity etc. 
So now what?  Hope for a new wave of VC funding to extend bitcoins capabilities to Visa/MasterCard volumes?  Sit back and pray someone sees this need and meets it?  I fear we are putting a lot of eggs in one basket and making big assumptions.  
What's the timeline and game plan for the next 6 months?  Is there even one on the table?
@_date: 2015-10-22 07:17:53
I know you're looking for specific examples, numbers, and company names. So I'll apologize in advance for the way in which I'm going to answer this question instead: 
I have a general understanding of how product development works. I've been in this industry for 18 years now. There's a general (if not obvious) rule that everybody already acknowledges: if you come up with a new product, it needs to be able to perform. Out of the gate.  Or it's not going to be used.  This is a universal truth for any new product. And quite honestly, it can't be argued with.
Especially if you're creating something that is a protocol which has (as its very nature) the ability to be coopted, and can host hundreds of different functionalities.  Functionalities and innovations that have all have (at their core) one common need:  transactions.  
It's going to be big thinkers, companies, entrepreneurs, innovators, and people all over the world that are going to take a quick look at this new technology and wonder if they can do what they want to do with it. Today. That means there are meetings going on right now.  Conversations, analyses, evaluations, and assessments being done of the bitcoin protocol right now for ideas and concepts and innovations that people want to make... tomorrow.
Unfortunately these individuals are seeing that the system is too limited. That the protocol can't handle what they want to do. And it's entirely likely that they're throwing their hands up, saying "forget it", and just walking out of the room.
I can't even imagine how many opportunities have already been lost. 
Aside from the Fidelity effect.  And other big players.  There have been several examples on the horizon of large companies taking a gander and scratching their heads at how limited it is.  Byrnes system is using colored coins because of it right?  What are we going to do when NASDAQ wants to use Bitcoin directly instead of some trusted third party centralized service?  These are just the tip of the iceberg that we actually hear about. How many hundreds of other conversations are being had right now, that are ending in "Well shit. Never mind" ....
To be quite honest, can you give me an example of an size able industry, or a large company that would be *able* to use bitcoin at 8 MB and perform all its necessary transactions?   I think that's the more important question. 
Let me to just say one last thing. Satoshi always intended for Bitcoin to be 100% capable of handling the demand across the industry. If you look at his comments he makes it very very clear. The place where he assumed wrong, and we somehow have stuck with it… is the assumption that adoption was going to happen gradually, slowly over several years/decades. That's not what's happening. 
Maybe there's some weird, erroneous hyperfocus on peer-to-peer transactions. Coffee shop purchases by hipsters who love bitcoin are the only metric by which we determine demand. And because were not seeing more of that, we just assume the bitcoin doesn't need to scale very urgently. I think it's a been well-established at this point that it's the banking and financial systems network that is going to have the largest value from using the bitcoin protocol.  They are the ones with the incentive. These are established companies that would like to save money. I'm not saying let's make bitcoin a banking tool. But I am saying that the financial industry in all forms, is the only truly incentivized party in this equation right now. So if were just sitting around waiting for people to start spending bitcoin out of their iPhone app wallets, then yes… we will probably be waiting decades. But that's not where the demand is coming from right now.
We all laugh and mock the banks for making their own internal block chains. But what would happen if they actually tried to use bitcoin to support their networks? I think you know the answer to that. And we all keep hoping that they're going to try these "private block chains" and find out that they're wasting their time. But what happens if they find that out? Guess what? We can't help them. At least not until the year 2035 apparently.

I'm seriously thinking of the most cost effective way to get some made.  The design and layout would have to be just right.  But the shirt would be kick ass if it's designed right.  It's a powerful statement people can send to everyone who walks by.  
500 was just my way of showing my enthusiasm.  Assuming $3 a shirt I wouldn't have that much to blow right now.  But one can always do 10 or 20 shirt batches with cafe press right?  I have access to designers I'd be happy to pay out of pocket. 
Was going to contact the guys at BitGear too. But I kinda want to have some say in the design portion. It can be done "ehhhh" or it can be done cool as shit. 
I would even be happy to sell them "at cost" plus shipping to anyone that wants one. It's more interesting to me to have these being worn, than try to make money off of it. As long as costs are covered Id put in the time. Just seems like such a cool shirt.

I wanted to mention something else. If the public discourse outside of the bitcoin community was such that everyone knew bitcoin could scale to whatever they needed, this wouldn't be *as much* of an issue. If everyone understood that it's limitations today don't define it as a product forever, they'd be less inclined to walk away from the conversation. 
I guess this is the downside of having no PR, sales, or marketing team to educate everyone in the industry. 
More importantly however, is the fact that they can't exactly "come to bitcoin headquarters", present their needs, and get a game plan in place with the dev team to address those scalability needs in time to release the new product. 
As a result it's almost like we've *got* to shoot for the sky on block size limit just to make sure that we're capable of supporting any number of parties out there that wish to participate.
We *have* to be ahead of the curve. Right now we're behind the curve. We've got to be capable of supporting transaction volumes greater than all the currently-interested parties combined. If we aren't ready when they sit down to discuss the idea, we aren't going to be an option for anyone. And every day that goes by, is another lost opportunity for adoption.

It didnt lose 40% of its value.   If you're referring to the Ether market that's been going for awhile, its some ridiculous market started by some opportunists who claim they bought ether during the presale.  People are just bidding on their coins, for a promised payout later.  Ethereum hasn't lost any value because it hasn't even begun trading yet.   Its value was roughly $0.33 per coin during the first phase of the pre-sale.  Give or take 3 cents.  It will be interesting to see if it ever goes higher than $0.33 cents.

I have a theory. You sound like you know more than me so what's your take on my theory? 
My theory is that somebody was pumping it all the way to the top. And now they've basically taken the plug out of the balloon. 
So this staggered decline is just the air slowly letting out of the balloon. There's no resistance because there never was any in the first place, except for the people that were pumping it. 
So we will pretty much basically go right back down to where we were before they began.  Thoughts?

I'm not collecting bit coiners addresses. I'm in bed right now. When I get up tomorrow morning I'll try and find the other thread.
Edit:  someone else found it already. I'm not doing this for any personal gain. If you're looking for a selfish motivation, there always is one I suppose. I have a decent amount of Bitcoins and it benefits me if the whole thing succeeds.  To think that 500 cars across the country will be carrying this bumper sticker seems cool to me, and I actually believe it's going to play a viral role in furthering adoption. Which in turn benefits me and all holders I guess. Mostly it annoys me that I can't be the guy making the bitcoin commercial for the Super Bowl or something else awesome. So this is my contribution. Even though it's a total loss of money. In the end it could be a really big gain. 
I'm investing "what I can afford to lose" on this.  I actually had over 1000 yBitcoin magazines sent to me here in Miami because I wanted to be the guy to distribute them. we actually got in my car and drove around town to small businesses and tried distributing them manually. It was a lot of work.  So... I'm just into this kind of stuff.

Yes. It was called America Online. CompuServe.
With all due respect this fatalistic mentality about advertising is exactly why we're sitting here whining that some scam has an entire auditorium full of people, and bitcoin doesn't. 
We *do* need it now. We need to stop comparing Bitcoin to the Internet in the 90s. It's not the same thing. This is a product. It is not just protocol. In fact, it's so many different things - - even more reason why there should be advertisements for it. From numerous different genres, industries, and groups.
There is a general complete cluelessness here about how things succeed in a marketplace. And sentiments like this, that we don't need anything except code, are wrong and need to be done away with. 
We've given the code almost a decade to prove that it's all we need. And here we sit with zero real-world adoption. That's because human beings don't operate that way.  Nobody cares about our code unless it can meet a need that isn't being met.  Nobody's going to know that it meets a need, unless someone tells them.
Enter marketing…

They do this because everyone was warning about this problem years ago and they were ignored.  For years.  They warned and begged for scaling.  And were told "No. Relax" by Core.  
So alternative implementations arose as a result.  Bad blood grew and grew.  Anger grew. Frustration grew.  Years passed.  And people emotionally and mentally detached themselves from blind loyalty to Core.  
And now - long after multiple alt clients have been around - now core is begrudgingly "willing" to scale.  With a solution that barely addresses the original concern of on chain scaling.  
So to answer your question:   now devs are blaming these folks for not activating their solution.  It's a hilarious twist of reality every time I hear someone say it.  
"Too little too late" - is basically the reaction they're getting.  And I do understand it on some level.  
@_date: 2015-10-05 04:31:07
So I want your opinion. What do you truly anticipate for the future of the bitcoin block chain itself? Based on how you're seeing things play out. There was a huge growth period in 2014/15.  But unless I'm crazy, I have seen things dramatically slow down. Almost to a stop.
It's my personal opinion that if we don't get the scalability issue resolved in the next six months, bitcoin is going to become literally irrelevant to the rest of the world. 
I know I won't shut up about it, but the fact that their most aggressive plan brings it to 8 MB by the year 2035 is absolutely laughable to me. We need quadruple that in the next six months.  But literally nobody is aware of that for some reason.  
In my opinion if bitcoin fails, it's going to be because of the lack of demographic/market/product awareness of the core developers. The lack of leadership in a decentralized system like this can result in inaction. And this is an issue that greatly concerns me. Because I think it's going to be the reason BTC fails.

The great part is we can let them say whatever "reason" they want. As long as they give one that sounds legit, it just adds more legitimacy to bitcoin in the eyes of the general public as a "real player" on the economic stage.

Im going with this explanation.  As long as nothing new is happening that would tie to consumer adoption, I don't expect things to change.  Even if we go up for a little bit.  Whether we keep going down?  No idea.  But I don't expect any bullishness until someone or something gets the mass market moving with Bitcoin.

Have you looked at the new supply line graph that shows now until 2140?  
The line basically stops going up and drastically levels off around 2024.  
The halving has massive impact on price.  
Took us from $300's to $1,000's this time and Bitcoin isn't even being used in the real world yet. 
Look at the chart.  Note the supply change at that date.  And then add in another 7 years of growth and adoption.

Wow you totally took that sentence and added 400 things to it. Did I say they're not being honest? Crazy people on here…
This was the point: whether or not their exchange succeeds, whether or not bitcoin succeeds, they now have a way to make a shit ton of money off of bitcoin. And that was the ultimate goal with the creation of this exchange. 
The people who make money in a gold rush are the ones selling the shovels. The people making money in the Bitcoin rush … No matter how bitcoin ends up… Are the people running exchanges. 
More power to them. But don't think for a second that they just created this exchange out of altruism. They're getting rich off of every single transaction that happens on that system. 
Point being? Even with low volume, they have more money than they did yesterday.  So they're happy.

Read the thread title:  we've seen this before.  Meaning it's a pump.  
I was being a little extra negative as to how far it would go, but it still crashed like a bitch exactly when we said it would.  Proving it wasn't organic adoption. Specific numbers aren't relevant.

Hi to (hopefully) some core devs.  Quick question for all of you.  No matter what opinions people may have on the lightning network solution for scaling, my understanding is that it's literally the only option currently on the table that can handle the transaction volume needed today by large companies wishing to provide services on the block chain.
Can I ask why the alternate solutions for scaling don't also meet this minimum criteria? I'm confused why there's two points of view on how we get there, but such a vastly different definition of where "there" is.  
One party is completely content with 8MB for the next X years and will not enable lightning network transaction-volume-capability until the year 2035.  The other party simply wants to use a different method to scale ... but realizes that bitcoin needs to be capable of these transaction volumes today. Now. 
While opinions may vary on how we get there, only one of these two parties is correct on where we need to be, today. 
So again my question is: I understand why there are differing opinions on how we get there. But why is there such a massive disconnect on where we need to be?
I think we all expected Bitcoin adoption to happen gradually over several years, or decades. And now we are faced with the reality that there are huge companies wishing to use it today. I think it's extremely important that we adjust our plans accordingly, or risk becoming obsolete.  No matter what method is chosen for getting there.
Thank you for your thoughts.

Banks want a blockchain setup because its a decentralized ledger that removes middle men from financial transfers.   Ripple is what they seem to be going towards right now.  So yes - a blockchain technology without miners and without financial rewards can be useful to Banks.  They're going to save billions of dollars a year and wont even need Bitcoin to do it.  Just "blockchain-like" technology.

OK for some reason I always thought the greater the distribution, the greater the cost. I didn't realize doubling your distribution would increase the chances that your expenses go down. Or the business becomes easier to maintain. 
But I guess that gives bragging rights to advertisers. So that means higher advertising fees and more advertisers. Which translates into continued business.
As far as getting it to people who will actually do something valuable with it? This is the biggest problem. Everybody wants a free magazine. Even a box of them. But I think a large portion of the people who might get a free box will have three quarters of a box sitting on the floor in their bedroom if you make the offer here.  They might drop a couple at a local grocery store checkout aisle when they're feeling rambunctious.  
Quality distributors is the big challenge.  Hard to verify that.

My comment still stands. It doesn't take this long to accomplish what is needed. I have managed developers for nearly 20 years. I've watched them pick their noses and cause massive scope creep and timeline / budget creep.  
I've watched other programmers develop incredible shit in record time without any risk to security.  It's the luck of the draw who you get on each particular project.  
Which one do you think we have on the Bitcoin project?  Here's a hint:  
The need to scale is far older than one year.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:25:30
Yep.  My entire Bitcoin worldview has now changed.  I really believed merchants could incentivize *new adopters* to hop on board with discounts.  But that's a completely unfeasible concept apparently.
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:55:54
Lol the CTO is apparently twelve. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:59:28
Yes they do.  I get charged between 3 and 7 percent for international cards that double as rewards cards.  If I offer a 2% discount, I still save 5% on the transaction.  In a lesser example, every merchant gets charged a minimum of 2.5% in merchant fees.  Offering 1% discount?  Even a 1% or 0.5% profit on every transaction (which goes up if its international) is worth the effort.  
The hundreds of thousands of idiots like me who need to transition to a cheaper merchant processor will see significant profits on each transaction.  We dream of 2.5% flat rate (plus 30 cents per transaction, plus international interchange fee).  I had one card that I got billed 12% on due to various fees.
I've seen you and others use this response ad nauseum, and it ignores kindergarten level math equations.  I don't know why it keeps getting repeated.   I run a store and offer 5-10% to my customers for bitcoin purchases.  That will go down when I get a cheaper merchant processor, but I will always offer discounts for bitcoin purchases. 
Ultimately maybe the thing you're missing is:  Its beneficial to merchants that "one day" a large percent of their customer base pays in Bitcoin.  So incentive is there even ahead of time, to encourage adoption.

Granted, it sucks that if BTC takes off we are going to be old as fuck when we finally get to enjoy it.  But I don't see BTC being worth much for at least 5 years.  So liquidating before then seems like a waste.

True, organic adoption price increases go up more gradually.  If you look at the chart for the last two months, you'll see what looks like genuine price increase activity. This whole nonsense that happened last time shooting up $1000 in two weeks simply wasn't related to adoption. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 16:03:28
Then what is it?  
Maybe all this talk about how bitcoin can be all these amazing things has made us set our goals too high? 
Maybe it never was intended to be a replacement for remittance companies, or financial services, or to "bring banking to the unbanked". 
Maybe all that was BS. Because apparently the protocol isn't even capable of supporting such infrastructure. Maybe bitcoin always was supposed to be, and always will be nothing more than a peer-to-peer cash system. 
In which case, I think it's investors should think hard about the value ever going above $300.  Or even staying above $100 once this realization sets in.

All joking aside, I've realized over and over that the only people who truly have incentive to use bitcoin are the early adopters. Every single service and product in the bitcoin space right now really only provides incentives for people who are sitting on massive profit and just want to spend it different ways. Not for anybody who would be new to bitcoin. Or anybody who's got an average number of coins and has to spend/replenish. Here we are at seven years and the general public still has no incentive to use bitcoin.

No.  It's called marketing.  Something we have zero of. 
Bitcoin would have the same type of hype if we put intelligent, thoughtful commercials on TV or did anything whatsoever to educate the public on it.  
But we have no marketing department. Bitcoin is 100% made up of coders right now.  So the public remains oblivious, and uninterested.
Yes I'm one of those guys that says we need other arms in the project than just coders. We need people who know the customers. We need people to know how to advertise and communicate with them. How to incentivize them. 
This is living proof that it could be done, but we're just not doing it. So the idiot scammers are doing it instead. 
Technically it would be the job of the Blockstreams Coinbases Circles and Bitpays to run the ads. 
But I still think we could crowdfund a couple very impressive PSA's that would be really impressive. Thoughtful.  But every time I've come up with this idea, everyone here just shits on it and says its a waste of time. 
Now maybe you'll see that hyping up the Sheeples is a big part of the success of a product / technology.  
If anyone out there thinks they could put together an impressive, intelligent, powerful PSA for the freedom that is brought to humanity by bitcoin, let's do it. Two or three versions would be great.  
If they are good enough, we could run the crowdfunding campaign for months/years.  Each time we reach a high enough dollar amount to run a batch on primetime television, will do it. Cable. Whatever. Then we wait for more funds to come in and run them again later. This could've been going on for the last five years. 
Again, if they're good enough, you'll get investors in the commercial alone. Genesis mining is one of the only companies out there that's doing any advertising whatsoever for bitcoin.

Sorry but totally false.  Everyone has had a problem with their bank account.  Everyone has been irritated with their bank, and how its treated them.  I never said I was talking about having assets seized or anything extreme.  
- Standing in lines.  
- Being forced to close an account because you don't use it enough.  
- Having an account closed against your will because you used it too much (maximum number of transfers)
- Having an account closed against your will because you don't hold a large enough balance in it.
- Being told you can't have another account open when you want to. 
- Getting charged money to store money in a bank in the first place.
- Getting charged a monthly or yearly service fee even though nothings being done for you.
- Depositing checks and being forced to wait 5 business days for funds to be released while the bank does god knows what with it (invests it?) without your permission.
- Having to buy the paper check books and wait 3 weeks for their arrival.  
- Shit being closed on Sundays.  
- No payments or deposits on holidays.  
- Getting charged $40 to move money to another persons account in another country.
- Getting charged $25 to move money to another persons account in your own country.
- Having to waste an hour driving to bank branches for cashiers checks because they're the only truly secure form of payment accepted for things like lease deposits.
- Being refused a new copy of your own lost ATM card because you don't have your birth certificate on you.
- Repeatedly having your debit card turned off due to fraud just because you bought gas in a different state.
Every single one of these things is addressed by bitcoin.
And unlike you stated above, these things *can* be done better by a Bitcoin holder, than a bank.
You're right.  People may not like their bank.  In fact they don't.  The lack of control over your own funds, and the freedom to do what you want with your own money will be appealing to literally everyone who has ever had to deal with banks.  These things grate on every person who has ever had a bank account.

LOL literally everything out of your mouth is so 2012.  You're (unknowingly) parroting the arguments the naysayers had years ago ... and 99% of those people are now saying the opposite.  Because they learned what Bitcoin actually is, and does.  
Just like them, your ENTIRE premise is propped up on the fact that's "it's not happening today".  Right now.  Immediately.  As if there is no process.  No tomorrow.  No growth or evolution of adoption.  This is a simplistic error in your logic. 
You're clearly new to thinking about this.  Because you're barely past the "It's a Ponzi / Tulip" phase. Mark my words.  You'll be here 5 years from now realizing you were being shortsighted as Bitcoin will still be here. 
The biggest fallacy in your argument? That it has no value. Are you fucking kidding me? The most ***obvious*** thing about bitcoin is that it's got so many possible functions. As a digital asset, a stock, a remittance system (YES ITS BEING USED FOR REMITTANCES TODAY) and a much more.  
Its value is in its utility.  
***Amazon.com didn't appear until twenty years after the internet got started***.  You're the dude in 1983 telling everyone that it's a waste of time because no one's using it. How smart do you feel realizing that?

My best friend is a financial advisor. They are, in general, extremely risk averse. So it really doesn't matter how legitimate, or how far bitcoin seems like it will go. People in that profession will tend to avoid it like the plague. At least until it's had 10 years of upward movement for them to look at. And the smaller the percent the better (implies slow &amp; steady). Then you'll see them hop on board.

17% of PayPal's volume (8 MB blocks) is a really nice first step for maybe the next 6 months. Although I can't shake the feeling that things are now moving quite quickly.  And that the companies that want to hop on board, want to do so in the next 6 to 12 months, and they are going to need more than 8 MB. 
Do we have any idea of the transaction volume of, say, Fidelity? Just as an example since they repeatedly come up in the conversation?
We also need to keep in mind that if this takes off, it's not just going to be one company. How many PayPals would Fidelity, Amazon, Chase, and NASDAQ constitute?

It is absolutely bewildering that so many people here staunchly stand by the statement that there can be no other method than Bitcoin proper.  
I want that to be true but my common sense meter is just not having it for some reason.

They've been cool to me too.  I did finally get that "You made a large deposit so tell us where it came from, where it went, and how you got it or we'll close your account" email ... but since I have nothing to hide, I answered freely.  
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:17:20
Yeah the problem is there is no solution to this.  Whether they use a QR code or not - the amount of money Circle pulls out of their account is too high.  So its a fail for anything "B2C" pretty much.  Totally unusable.
The only scenario this will work is if someone buys bitcoin and is lucky enough to see an overall increase in bitcoin value.  But this usecase is for new users who want to fund &gt; purchase all in one step.
I can't tell people to just buy bitcoin and then play the odds that the value will increase later.  In fact i was going to advise that they buy the BTC and purchase immediately (to get their 5% off) to avoid any market fluctuations.
So I simply don't see a solution to this.

So what is the thinking behind wanting it only as a store of value? What's the long-term benefit of that? 
And short-term what does that really mean? That the price has to stop being volatile? It could be two dollars and as long as it stays two dollars, it's a store of value, and therefore a success?
Do you think these individuals are just not the type that shoot very high? Since store of value seems pretty easy to achieve.  One might say it's already that as we've been stable for 2 years.

So they started out wanting to use the bitcoin block chain. But then they realize that the bitcoin block chain can't handle any actual transaction volume whatsoever. So they went with an alternative. 
How many more opportunities are we going to miss before we get this shit fixed, devs?
Satoshi never intended for bitcoin to be unable to handle current demand. In fact he said the very opposite. Bitcoin is supposed to scale to meet the transaction volume demand. It just came a little faster and in a different form than we anticipated.

Exchanges follow each other. Just because you were able to purchase something doesn't make the price real. Coinbase was following MtGox and MtGox was manufacturing a fake price. You understand that right? This is very basic.
When we're looking back in history at where Bitcoin has actually gone, it would be a little bit ridiculous to look at a fake, manufactured price and claim that it's relevant to this conversation. It's not.

Can you confirm that you guys will have a very sexy looking, noninvasive graphic badge that people can put on their e-commerce stores? 
I think this should be the core of your efforts going forward. As more and more fake storefronts taking bitcoin pop up, people are going to start looking for that badge.
Something people can put on their site that shows they are trusted in the bitcoin network. I would strongly advise against using those badges on your FAQ though. They look maybe okay for something internal if someone goes to view my profile on your site. 
But ..no different than Thawte or VeriSign badges people put on their site, one for bit rated would be perfect. Maybe using your logo which looks quite nice. We need something to put on our sites so people know we don't collect their bitcoins and ship nothing.
Also, I would recommend creating partnerships with Bitpay, coinbase, and any other legit merchant service. If they can provide trustworthiness in transaction data to you, that's a lot more relevant than a Facebook page.

@_date: 2015-11-14 02:40:34
I hope so. I mean I guess the plus side of having a bunch of centralized services on the layer above, is that these companies should… technically… have sales and marketing teams. So you've got a group of people that are actually out there actively selling the concept of the bitcoin block chain. The bitcoin block chain itself has no marketing team. There's nobody organizing any efforts. And I feel like that's a huge gap right now.

Yep.  Private block chains have been labeled "a complete waste of time offering zero cost savings or benefit".   And ethereum has been mocked as vaporware and a useless joke alt coin. 
All I care about now is whether we are seeing services / innovation / startups on the layer above the Bitcoin protocol.  
If that doesn't start happening soon, Bitcoins future is uncertain. Because this teeny weeny block size scaling improvement is barely a drop in the bucket.  The industry needs more.  Far more.  And they're storming ahead without us.  
I hope Lightning Network has put money in the budget for a team of sales and marketing reps.  Because this stuff isn't going to sell itself.  
In fact the sales and marketing teams for each of the centralized services on "the layer above" are going to be what makes or breaks Bitcoins future.  They will be the ones extending Bitcoins capabilities. And they are going to have to sell their product to the industry.
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:48:31
Damn. Then you'd likely end up mostly with altruistic people that have a little spare change to throw around. I guess I would be one of those people. I would dump the 200 for it, but you're likely not going to get the main demographic of bitcoin to dump that kind of cash. If you're fine with it maybe 149 would work. I hate cutting into people's fair and reasonable profit though.
In the end, like someone else pointed out, there's no financial incentive to do it. So it would likely have to be cheap. However as an entrepreneur myself, there's a market for everything. Make the product. Make it look cool. Do a Steve Jobs on it. And offer it for sale. I guarantee you will get people buying it. May not be 1 million orders a year but I bet you make money.

I don't think there are hundreds of trolls.  That doesn't reflect reality to me.  
I think there are a growing number of people who have a problem with the general picture right now.  They feel that development run by people with a major conflict of interest, is a very bad thing.  
That anyone who's got access to modify the protocol code, should not be employed by any third-party which may influence them. 
And that any missed deadlines, or actions implying this conflict of interest is resulting in changed development behaviors (of any kind) are reasons for concern. 
How they express that?  Comes in many colors.  From crazy nonsense to rational arguments. 
I think that's reality.

I actually had this conversation with someone last night. I think if you have $1 million, you would assume at the most, 8% interest per year. We have to take out tax when you cash your BTC out. What's that? 15%?
Now you have $850,000.
And don't you get taxed something like 20% on that 8% interest each year?   It's considered income.  
Now you're only getting $54,000 a year.
That's $4500 a month.   
Mediocre car payment:  $500
Mediocre mortgage/rent:  $3,000
$300 for food. 
$100 cell phone. 
$100 electricity. 
$100 cable &amp; internet. 
Now you only have $400 left per month.
I suppose it's doable. 
But you're basically living in bumfuck Ohio comfortably or you're living in a major city and barely getting by.  
With absolutely zero luxuries.  
I'd shoot higher for a retirement goal.

The people on local bitcoins are ripping everyone off simply because the price jacking has become normal there and everyone is desensitized to it now.  
It's a great way to take advantage of people who are desperate for privacy, and make a lot of money off of them. It is not a solution for the average person who wants to get bitcoin easy. There's no reason anyone should have to pay a mark up like that. Other than greed.

It's a great read, but it's mostly talking about how bitcoin is going to disrupt the system. Which we already know. It doesn't present any reason at all why we should just forget permissioned ledgers. In fact it clearly validates the fact that banks will save money with them, even in the long run.  
From the article:

Well I'm thankful that I finally came to the realization that they're basically taking 70% of the block chain concept and tossing it in the trash, while keeping the 30% they like. In that sense they're creating a very inefficient form bitcoin. Very inefficient version of the Blockchain. In that sense, they really could've made something just as good if not better using a shared database system two decades ago. So that part I'm finally understanding.
I think the disconnect here is that everyone thinks that if they're going to use a Blockchain system, they have to use bitcoin. 
They don't. They can create an incredibly inefficient, expensive clone of the block chain and tweak it until it's something they like to look at. They're simply not creating bitcoin. They don't want bitcoin. They don't want the decentralization. They don't want transparency. They sure as hell don't want a bunch of Chinese guys in warehouses sleeping on dirty mattresses, securing their financial system. 
So they're not "missing the point" with bitcoin. They're creating something completely different, and it may look a little weird to us. 
But it's going to do everything they need it to do. So weve got two different conversations going on here. The fact that they could've done this very easily two decades ago with a distributed database system. And the fact that people think they're trying to copy bitcoin. But they're not.
In the end, they will save themselves some money with whatever dental floss/bubblegum thing they construct. And bitcoin will still be bitcoin. Doing what it does everywhere else. I just hope that the infrastructure surrounding it continues to grow. Because without the infrastructure, the innovators, and the idea people: the technology is going nowhere.

I'm aware of the lightning network. But is that really going to be enough for an entirely new financial industry? There's got to be hundreds of start up ideas that could be happening right now, but nobody's doing anything and that concerns me. 
I understand your point that right now everything is small enough that they can use the block chain directly. That makes some sense. I'm just worried that I'm not seeing any growth otherwise.
My understanding regarding side chains was that a whole plethora of new functionalities, features, and enhancements would be enabled to extend the bitcoin protocol on a layer above. And yes, I think a year and half is plenty of time to expect some movement there, but I don't see anyone doing anything. Aside from LN. 
As for me? I'm a project manager. So I live and breathe creation of specifications, timelines, planning, milestones, and the development and completion of projects. Probably explains my concern about not seeing timelines, milestones, priority lists, etc. When I'm told that everyone's just arguing and reaching a stalemate, that's strikes me as really unnecessary. But it indicates a lack of leadership. Usually. One of the perks of centralization I guess? I don't have the ability to create a side chain, or code anything.

There is a whale club. And they do coordinate pumps. And this is this spike is right in line with the last one. With almost a perfectly spaced dip followed by this perfectly spaced spike (time wise). 
I'm just hoping that the little tiny lines at the bottom mean that this time around, there's a significantly higher number of people involved? Implying organic (non whale club) activity.

Right now banks are the only ones that I can see, who are set up to take advantage of bitcoins improvements over Fiat.
Consumers need an infrastructure to take advantage of Bitcoins benefits. Once that infrastructure is in place, all the benefits of bitcoin over fiat will be available to them. 
The utility to consumers is obvious. The question is whether they are incentivized to take advantage of it. At this time I'm not seeing that. I believe that's a result of lack of infrastructure and education.

1)  Show me there are innovators and entrepreneurs en masse building Financial products and services on the layer above bitcoin right now. Where are they? Aside from Coinbase, BitPay, Circle, and BitWage.  
2)  Show me that the protocol is set up in such a way that it would be akin to the iPhone App Store. Allowing a plethora of multifaceted "financial apps" to be built on top of it, creating an entire ecosystem of block chain financial systems. 
If you can't show me those two things, then my facts are correct. There's no infrastructure.  There's nothing on the way aside from LN.  And the Protocol isn't even capable of supporting one.

How do you protect against those who don't work for banks but still commit fraud in the form of Bitcoin startups?  If Bitcoin has taught me one thing, it's that there's more fraud in the consumer realm than in the regulator realm. Surprise.  Humans are humans. Whether they're in power or not.

The reason I bash electronic storage devices is because I had a shit ton of coins in BitcoinQT back in the day, and though everyone was using it without any problems, mine somehow "broke". 
I did some weird USB transferring back-and-forth on and off the drive, and when I tried to pull that wallet.dat File back in to QT, it wouldn't import. My other dat file imported but the passphrase was changed by a bug in the software.
I literally almost lost $100,000 that day.  This was back when BTC was $1,100.  
To say I almost shit my pants, would be an understatement. The only way I saved it was that I had deleted a copy of the same DAT file and it was still sitting in my recycle bin on my Windows machine. So I restored that one which hadn't been moved around via USB, and it imported successfully. If I had cleared out my recycle bin, it all would have been gone.  
That's when I decided I would never, ever trust my life savings to some piece of software that could have bugs, or some electronic medium that could break. Not during the "wild west" stage of bitcoin at least. Maybe in the future when huge institutions have a great reputation, and insurance against loss.
But until then, there's no way I'm putting my funds at the mercy of someone else's programming skills or some devices ability to keep functioning.  With paper wallets, I retain 100% control, and also 100% responsibility. If something goes wrong, it's my own fault. And if I don't screw up, nothing does go wrong. Which is more than I can say when I'm at the mercy of software, or some hardware.

Right. Because today is the last day bitcoin will ever be capable of changing. And the infrastructure stopped evolving last week. So nothing new will be built. Therefore we can claim that bitcoin, in its current state, is how it will always be. Right?

First off, we would control the system. Increasing transaction volume doesn't "cater to banking parasites". 
If you read my first response, I made it very clear that this recommendation does not just benefit banks. It benefits any company that has a high transaction volume for any reason. 
There could be smart contract companies. Legal companies. Escrow companies. They're all going to need high transaction volumes. Especially when you've got not one, but 40 different companies of 40 different types using the Blockchain. 
And to be honest, when I think of it this way, it almost seems impossible that we could keep modifying the protocol itself to cater to this industry. It almost seems like a layer on top of the protocol is the smarter solution for this. But we've got to decide what the protocol itself needs to be capable of. I don't care if we build a layer on top, or modify the protocol. It just seems like modifying the protocol would be an endless, miserable project. 
Banks are just a current example because banks have high transaction volume and are the only industry that seems to be incentivized to use bitcoin at all right now. 
I'm perfectly fine if banks make their own little block chains and die a slow death. Believe me. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:23:40


Devs:  We keep hearing this and it worries me.  I never thought Bitcoin had a chance of failing until this became the new theme. Companies want to use the system, but can't.

You're correct it's not. But it should be a concern to all of us that there's nothing being built on the layer above to actually make Bitcoin usable in a real world financial setting. This is what is needed. And it turns out they can't do it because the protocol itself is too limiting. [See LukeJRs response]( to my question about this last week. 
Ethereum is getting all that attention.  Do we have a financial tool that can't even be used to replace legacy financial products and services?  Even if it wanted to?
I've always said that Bitcoin is growing all this infrastructure. And that's why I felt confident about its future.  But I realized recently that it wasn't. Adding it as a payment option isn't building infrastructure. 
Infrastructure for bitcoin has to be Apps and Services on the layer above the protocol.  But apparently that can be done. So this is a very serious issue. This is where the line is drawn as to whether Bitcoin grows.  
We need something like iOS for the iPhone. Where you can build an entire universe of unique products and services as apps… on top of a basic protocol.

I can tell by your post that you're a "business" type and unfortunately your type is actively discouraged, if not completely shunned from this whole situation by the more technically-inclined.  
And now you see why Bitcoin may be screwed.  It's 100% devs who have zero training in the concepts you just presented, which are commonly used in the business world to solve problems exactly like this.  
When you have a bunch of developers who dont interact with others due to a preconceived notion that they have nothing to contribute simply because they can't write code..... you end up with a bunch of leaderless developers who are stuck in gridlock, and the technology moves nowhere. Maybe they'll wake up one day and realize they need to work with others.

How can you guys keep claiming there's some stupid FUD campaign behind this sentiment?   
I'm not part of any campaign.  I'm just someone on the other side of the product development equation from you and your fellow programmers.  
You guys have little to no awareness of what makes a product succeed in a marketplace.  I have little to no awareness of how to code.  
I do not play the role of programmer in the projects that I've managed.  The programmers on this project should not be playing any other role than writers of code.  They should not be the ones who decide what features this product has, when they need to be released by, or what is and isn't important to address.  
Why?  Because Core devs have absolutely zero fingers on the pulse of the demographic they're coding for, and they quite honestly don't care to.  They've proudly declared that the community is irrelevant, and they actively insult the people who are trying to build financial services to make Bitcoin succeed, like Brian Armstrong.  
First rule of development projects:  you don't arrogantly ostracize the very people you're creating the product for.  
The vast majority of people who you blindly label as paranoid FUD spreaders are simply people who understand the business side of things.  The shit you guys have zero clue about: the things that ensure a product will actually succeed once it's released.  
The fact that this entireportion of the process is being ignored and even ridiculed, is a very serious concern for anyone who has the first fucking clue what differentiates a successful product, from one that *- nobody uses -*
Final note:  
It is incredibly inappropriate for *any* core dev team member to continue writing code for Bitcoin while being employed by a company that may influence timelines, or the code being written.  Any individual found to have a conflict of interest like this should be expected to surrender their commit access.  This should be a global rule.  For obvious reasons. 
This is all just my opinion.  FUD-free.

@_date: 2015-11-04 15:38:19
There's a problem with your theory that this is happening because of improvements in the ecosystem: 
That doesn't result in a sudden shooting up of price to the tune of over $100 in a 24 hour time period. Chart going literally vertical.  Changes in the ecosystem always, always, always result in gradual inclines in value. 
This is not natural adoption. Do you actually believe that tens of thousands of people just suddenly decided to start competing for a higher bitcoin price literally on a dime? Like a light switch?  Randomly?  On a Tuesday afternoon?  On the exact same day the last fake pump started two years ago?

As they say, the only people who make money in the gold rush, are the ones selling the shovels. So if you're going to get a bite of the profit whether or not bitcoin ever succeeds, the best thing you can do is build an exchange. Endless flow of money pouring in from transaction fees.

Probably nothing wrong with it. Just trying to re-create the wheel, in a manual, highly modified fashion. That's what happens when you are too afraid of the scary illegal terrorist gambling porn bitcoin option.
I still think in the long run that financial companies will latch into bitcoin by using services built on top of bitcoin.  Ones that are centralized, regulated, secure, and have built a longstanding reputation of being trustworthy companies. 
This will allow banks to use the bitcoin block chain to secure their transactions without having to directly interact with the "wild west" form of the "raw" protocol of the olden days. But that's probably 10 years out.

This is my problem with banks.  Its not the whole bail out nonsense.  Its the fact that they can close my account without warning because I'm not holding enough money in it.  Or because I'm doing too many transfers in and out of it from my other accounts.  Random, stupid reasons that ruin my day and limit my ability to function financially on any given day because of rules they pulled out of their ass.  Rules focused entirely on convenience and expense for them.

Sorry did we read the same article?   The entire thing had all the hallmarks of the idiotic articles that have ever been written.  Bitcoin is used by crooks.  Bitcoin itself is basically a pointless endeavor.  Its the block chain that has meaning and value.  Bitcoin is promoted by "fanatics" (his word).  Bitcoin is a Libertarian pipe dream.  Bitcoin enthusiasts only are such because they want its value to go up.  Forget all of them.  Lets focus on something other than Bitcoin as a currency.   Because it "may or may not" ever become anything.
Why is this a great step forward?  Oh .. .because we assume they'll eventually one day figure out that they need Bitcoin.
They are improving upon a very poor system right now.  They can and will make something that has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin and see significant cost savings and improvements, because the current system is just that bad.  Whether it ends up being a "bank chain" that is nothing more than a distributed database, or their own internal block chain proper.
Please explain why these banks would go near Bitcoin proper?  Do you really think a huge multinational bank is going to trust chinese miners sleeping on dirty mattresses in warehouses, to secure their customers financial records?  Even though you and I realize that those elements are irrelevant - banks wont agree.  Nor will they go anywhere near Bitcoin simply because of its reputation.  
I'm just not seeing solid reasons why they will eventually come around to Bitcoin, and why we should be happy about being insulted repeatedly in yet another ignorant article.

I don't sell products that I only make a 3% margin on. In general I consider that a stressful, shitty deal in the first place. Most of my products 
I don't know what businesses these guys are in but if you're losing money on a 3% discount then you're running a business with abnormally poor margins. Normal wholesale costs for products almost always are 15-40% cheaper than their retail price.  That fact is true almost across the board. 
Unless you are the 5th guy down the chain in the process you shouldn't be seeing 3% margin.  I have about 40 products in my store.  99% of them have 30-40% margin.  I buy directly from the manufacturer. 
Only one product has 5% margin. That product is priced horribly by a huge conglomerate manufacturer to start.  Then they have absurdly high minimums to buy direct.  So everyone has to get it 3rd and 4th hand.  By that point a measly 10% margin turns into 5%. If my entire business were like that I'd never make money.  It's like turning the gears just as hard and watching pennies fall out.

This is an idea I and a few others had several years back when we first discovered bitcoin. In the cities where I have lived, Miami/San Diego/Los Angeles there are people standing on street corners with signs literally everywhere. Especially in San Diego with all the ex military.
The ability for them to have a QR code on their sign without requiring people to pull up, roll down their windows, and hand physical cash to them, is an obvious transition to the future. People just drive by, shoot them funds, and keep going. 
As with everything in bitcoin, the problem is that there's no infrastructure. We think we have infrastructure, but we don't. 
A system would need to be built on the layer above facilitating the homeless to acquire QR codes.  Those QR codes would be associated with a recognized charity or service that offers an app.  The person driving by will therefore know their funds will only be used for food or supplies. 
This network could facilitate the creation of the QR codes, and the holding of balances. The organization would have relationships with local grocery stores and drug stores, allowing them to go shopping with their bitcoin balance to buy food, and get products necessary to live.  
If done correctly, people would actually donate more because they know the funds could only be spent on food or supplies, instead of alcohol or drugs. See how that works? Welcome to the future!
Then of course we have the problem that right now, those driving by likely won't be holding Bitcoin balances.  But this could absolutely work if Bitcoin infrastructure starts getting built, and use cases start expanding. As with everything in bitcoin, the problem is the on-ramps, the off-ramps, and the complete lack of infrastructure in between. 
We need innovators to start building services on the layer above so this experiment we believe in can really start changing the world for the better.

No I won't.  There will be a bubble beforehand, a plateau, and then it will settle at a higher overall price afterwards. 
Their claim is that $239 is where it will stay because it's already priced in. 
You can't have such a drastic drop in supply with no change in price. 
Also:  when did it get priced-in? We're as low as we've ever been right now.  I must have missed the big spike...
It wont be at an average of $239 six months afterwards, unless some other factor comes into play.

I think the point here is that the conspiracy theories were just that.  
As a general rule:  anytime you claim to know the ***intent*** behind someone's actions, you've deviated from your realm of knowledge and cast yourself into the world of speculation.  
People do this a lot. They see an action, and create an entire storyline behind it which supports their pre-existing bias.   
When you start claiming you know "why" someone does something, what someone's "really thinking", or what their intentions "really are", you've declared yourself a psychic and are operating outside of rational reality.

Just trying to get my head around why the naysayers claim private block chains are a waste of time. Think about it though: the process of sending an international wire transfer involves how many parties? Have you seen that diagram?

Barely.  For what?  Drug purchases on the dark web.  Before you roll your eyes - tell me what Bitcoin is being "used" for right now?  Companies started accepting bitcoin and that pretty much went nowhere.   It completely stopped.  A handful of them reverted and dropped it.  So that whole "bitcoin being used" thing fell flat on its face there.   
Now the narrative around here is that you make fun of people who want Bitcoin to actually be "used" for things like buying a Coffee.   So that monumentally fucked up mindset is the new opinion on bitcoin being "used".
Do you have any idea what the transaction volume would look like if you eliminated drug purchases and speculative buying/selling?   Ill give you a hint.  NewEgg accepting Bitcoin probably generates 0.00001% of the transaction volume.   
Bitcoin has absolutely zero real-world adoption right now. I've been here waiting since early 2012 for the real world to care bitcoin exists, and to actually use it.  They're not doing it.  For many reasons, not the least of which is lack of incentive and usability issues. *Maybe* Japan getting on board is what is pushing it up to 1500 right now but its also very possibly the new Gox (Bitfinex) situation playing a large role.  
Bottom line:  Saying "Bitcoin is being used", needs qualification.  There was a time when businesses (Fidelity, NASDAQ, etc) wanted to actually make Bitcoin "used" ... but they bailed because it couldn't handle their transaction volume, and didn't "do enough"  (here we are back to my original point ....)
Yet that other coin is being evaluated by JPMorgan, BofA and countless others for widespread use in banking and other applications, and has already been "used" by Microsofts Azure since Mid 2016.  Where's Bitcoin in all that?   Nowhere.  No major industries are using Bitcoin and as far as I know, none plan to, because it is too slow, and lacking in features/functionality.  There are multitudes more businesses evaluating that "other coin" because of its usefulness, innovation, flexibility, and feature set.   
So first mover advantage?  That time period is coming to a close.  I hate to say it because I am heavily invested.   But I don't deny reality, even if it makes me feel "yucky" inside.

Well we are still in the stage where they are running to purchase it so they can try it out. It's only been a few weeks.  
Article also said that several major businesses have "signed up" to use it, and their applications are pending with the various merchant services. So I think "up" is the only direction for a while.
Give it a few months before they realize it's irritatingly inefficient. That's when I expect the price to correct (if this is coming from Japan). 
Bitcoin needs to get its shit together quick. Because real people are actually trying to use it now.

There are companies right here in the United States that don't even use merchant processing services for bitcoin. There's a restaurant here in Miami called Latin house grill. He simply has his own bitcoin address. 
You could very easily use an address on an exchange (Bitstamp) that only charges a tiny amount to cash out. Obviously it would be a manual process, but at least you can get going. And it's not unheard of to do it this way. 
I realize you're goal is to find a merchant processor for your geographic area. So I hope somebody chimes in with that info as well.  I wonder if bitstamp will ever add merchant processing...

The police officer went out of his way to comment that he was going to use the money for nefarious purposes. That's the element I'm speaking about. , Even though the guy technically got arrested for doing more than $10,000 in a transaction. Why did they have to do the other part? Just to make it sound worse? 
So this doesn't change my point at all. There's sneaky bullshit going on in transactions involving law-enforcement. If they are going to arrest the guy for surpassing $10,000 per transaction, then arrest him for that. You don't have to tell him some bullshit that you're going to use the money for stolen credit cards, just so you can make it look better in court. It's deceptive and quite honestly it's none of his business what people do with cash they have. It's their legal risk.  Not his.

It does to explain why it's higher on the other exchanges. Because when one exchange goes up, other exchanges do as well.

I've said it before and I will say it again. There is a reason why Developers should *not* be in control of product development priorities, naming, feature lists, or planning for a product. That is the job of the sales, marketing, and product development teams who actually *interface with the customer*. They are the ones who do the research and know what's needed for a product. They are the ones who are supposed to decide what things are called, what features come next, and how quickly shit gets out the door.
Bitcoin has none of that. You've got a Financial product, being created for a financial market, by a bunch of developers with *no* experience in finance, and (more importantly) absolutely *no way* for the market to have any input or control over what gets done, or what it's called.  That is crazy to me. 
Luke is a perfect example of why you don't give developers control over *anything* other than the structure of the code. 
They are not supposed to be making product development decisions. They are not supposed to be naming anything. And they definitely are not supposed to be deciding "what comes next" or how quickly things get done. In any other company, this process would be considered suicide.

Totally false. You must love the fact that you can't trust anybody in the Bitcoin space right now, and you must love that this trustless system now requires trust just to function without endless fraud.  You must love getting Goxxed over and over and over. 
We have the possibility of creating technological systems that can eliminate trust without regulation or rules. But nobody's fucking doing it.
If you don't have that? Youve got a bitcoin world that is literally impossible to function within. Because you don't know what product or service is going rip you off next. 
I'm to the point where I don't download any new Bitcoin wallet apps, or use any new bitcoin products or services. Because I don't know if they are going to steal my shit. What kind of world is that to live in?
When there's no punishment, no rules, and no fear of prison - human beings show that they don't do "what's right".  They go out of their way to do wrong instead.  The whole anarchist viewpoint that humanity is basically good, has been proven wrong once again. Given the choice, people steal. They don't do what's right. At least the bad apples.
The mindset that corruption only exists in the world of authority figures is absolute and complete bullshit. Corruption exists in humanity, period. If there are no rules, and no punishments, then you aren't going to be able to walk out your front door without fear of someone harming you. That's an unrealistic world to live in and an idiotic worldview to have.
We have shown the world that bit coin can't function without rules and regulations. And nobody has stepped up to create these technological systems that eliminate trust fully. So now the regulators are moving in.  We have screwed ourselves.  
We failed the test of automated corruption prevention. And in doing so we've invited regulation upon us.

This is false.

You're making a blind generalization:  "bank = middle man".  This is why they're looking at Ripple.

Any "innovation" so significant that it changes the core tenets of the White Paper (in fact it's entire *raison d'être*) should go on another coin with a completely new White Paper.  
At that point you're making a new cryptocurrency.  
Innovation that enhances the feature-set while upholding its intended purpose is acceptable. But when you get to the point that you liken White Paper adherents to religious zealots, something has gone seriously wrong.

That's a valid response, except to people like me, who signed up with you on Day 1 and have literally done hundreds of transactions totaling in the tens of thousands without a hitch.  Under no circumstances should I still have to wait a week for my coins.  
Before you say that Im granted instant transactions, you disabled my debit card even though it was working for over a year, and now I can't do instant transactions, nor can I buy from your mobile app.  I'm not going to buy Bitcoin on credit.   And my debit card is not a fraud risk.
To be quite honest I think the problem is that people are annoyed that you still treat them like a fraud risk when you know they arent.  My suggestion is another layer of verification for accounts with some seniority or those which have reached a certain thresshold in quantity of transactions.  Then drop the week wait, and allow debit cards.
At some point you've got to trust some of your users.

Ahhhhhgghg the old "The halvening price is already built in" statement.  The most irritating fallacy on this sub, hands down.   Nobody has bought because of the halvening yet. At least not enough people to have moved the price.

You are correct. I'm not trying to be overly cynical. I just think it was a really smart financial move to build an exchange. Can you imagine getting a cut of every single transaction that happens? 
I used to sit on Cryptsy and just watch hundreds and thousands of transactions go by every minute. Wouldn't you be rich instantly?
Yes, they own 1 million bitcoins. But if Bitcoin goes to zero, they get rich the entire way there. This has created a win-win situation for them financially. I'm just saying, smart move guys.

It's ridiculous to state that the effect has already taken place. 
Have your buying behaviors changed because of it? No. And neither has anyone else's. We are too far out.
Just prior to it, there will be a speculative bubble by a handful of folks. And when the halving occurs, the price will be pushed even higher.  So for about three months before and three months after, there will be a bubble. 
But after that, the price will settle at a new, higher base than we are currently at. Simply because supply will be stripped in half.
Absolutely nothing has happened yet. Nothing has been priced in at this stage.

I think I'm understanding what's going on here finally. 
The banking system just has a shitty structure. A bad set up. Yes they could've improved it over the last couple decades using many of the available tools. They just didn't. So now they are improving in using block chain technology. 
So what they are doing is actually going to save them money, time, etc.  They're not trying to build another bitcoin. They're trying to improve their processes. *And anything is an improvement over what they've currently got.*
They could've done it with a "synchronized database API" (or whatever) for the last 20 years. They just didn't. So they're doing this instead. It's a valid use case.

It's important to realize that there are large holders moving the price around for temporary profits. Don't rely on any price for longer than a week or two.

So you can make something cheaper. Great! Get off your ass and start a company. Do something that's going to further Bitcoin with the general population like these guys have. 
Where have you been for the last four years? Why didn't you come up with this idea? Now that somebody has, our job is to rip them to shreds? Of course!  We kill our own proponents.  Fuck Coinbase I've got paper wallets!  Fuck Circle!  BitPay is useless, I've got my own receiving address!  Without these companies Bitcoin would still be a joke to the masses. 
Nobody does anything in this community. And when a company finally does, we just attack them. A bunch of lazy, unmotivated armchair shit talkers who think they can do things better... but don't bother. Did you guys raise tens of millions in funding and sell tens of thousand of these on Amazon?  No.  So as far as I'm concerned, your opinion is not relevant.  
If you can do this cheaper, then start a business. Get off your rear ends and get some VC funding. Raise tens of millions of dollars because you can sell triple the quantity at 1/4 the price. Let's get the competition going. Do something. Or be quiet.
 If the price is too high, then be mad about it. Just like a supernerd is mad that his phone costs $799 when he could hack one together for $50.  Nobody cares about that guy.  And that guy will never further Bitcoin adoption with his whining. That guy just sits in his fucking basement and complains. He doesn't start businesses.

Someone else here said evolution isn't a necessary part of nature, nor technology projects.  Yep.  You're all definitely programmers.  
This is why in the real world coders are given a task list and just told what to do.  Coders code. They don't plan.  They don't manage.  And they don't make decisions outside of consulting on technical limitations. Acting as technical advisors.  
They report to those above them, so that those with actual input from *all* parties in the ecosystem can make a far more educated decision. 
But by all means, scoff at this idea.  
The idea that there might actually be people more qualified than coders, to plan a project. People who actually have some fucking input from… you know… the rest of the ecosystem?  The people none of you actually interact with?

Bitcoin in the USA and many developed countries will be like this.  Bitcoin in other countries won't.  And more importantly there will be options for "power users" who want to stick to "pure" Bitcoin style.  
We live in a country that values regulation and trust to discourage fraud. As we've seen, when consumers are given a free-for-all to do whatever they want, it's robbery after robbery after robbery with little time for a breath in between. 
While people in power also commit fraud, the rules make it much harder to accomplish, and nearly impossible for consumers to accomplish.  Some consider this better than a Gox, Neo, Butterfly Labs, KNC Miner, PayCoin every five minutes.

Unfortunately larger faster blocks are only one of many features being added to these other block chains.  
Obsolescence is a very real concern in my opinion.  And every time I've raised this concern, the only response I get from the core developers is "Relax dude. We've got time".  That's literally their only response.

You don't see me telling you how to code.  Likewise all who code need to acknowledge they aren't product experts, and stop trying to pretend they are. You guys need to drop the egos and submit to the demands of your userbase, or you will have a product on your hand that isn't usable in real life.

That would be because Bitcoin is so insanely hard to build businesses around.  I'm starting to think maybe Bitcoin was only supposed to be peer-to-peer cash, and not something that the business world was ever supposed to embrace.   Nearly every company that has tried to "extend" Bitcoin and build a business around it has struggled or failed.  If we have to hack the shit out of it just to get it to do basic (extra) things, that isn't good.  And if its title as peer to peer payment system has gone the way of the dinosaur, then what's left?

America Online is a private block chain that is alive and well 25 years later, and has made trillions of dollars in the process. So let's make sure we acknowledge that also.
And both it, and Compuserve actually rode on top of TCP/IP.  So the analogy doesn't work that well.

In the real world of software development, developers don't make the decisions on whether timelines shift. And they sure as shit don't make commitments regarding the project as a whole, speaking on behalf of (or in this case despite) the input of the other arms in this decentralized starfish.  
Because in the real world they don't have the authority, nor the knowledge to comment globally on what's best for the project.  Primarily because they are only *one part* of the ecosystem, and arguably not the most important part either.  Because no matter how great your code is, if nobody uses it, it's dead.

Let me offer something up here.  I literally was just browsing the web and came across tons of totally random "storefronts" claiming they're selling Propecia and other products for Bitcoin.  It struck me right then and there, that we are going to have a whole wave of thousands and thousands of fake Bitcoin websites.  Storefonts that just collect Bitcoin and never ship any product.  If its not already happening, its going to, and that is further going to destroy people's trust in Bitcoin and fuck its ability for mainstream adoption.  
Why ?  Because people can't do chargebacks.  All you have to do is set up a store and claim you take Bitcoin.  People buy things and you dont ship.  Its pure Bitcoin theft.
But what if there was a merchant reputation system?  One that does NOT include a consumer reputation system at all, and has nothing to do with Bitcoin addresses or the blockchain directly at all?  A way for customers to differentiate between rogue fake Bitcoin storefronts and legit stores that actually ship?  Like - Verified by Visa.  Thawte.  A badge that all online stores put on their checkout screens that can be confirmed legit.  Stating that this merchant ships, even if you pay with Bitcoin.  And that reputation increases as you do so even more.  
As people purchase in bitcoin and they receive their products, they are encouraged to put a "tick" in favor of that merchant, and that merchant's badge increases to show more and more legitimacy, seniority, and history.  As more and more scam sites will be popping up, legit merchants will be scrambling to get one of these badges and show they are different.  
Is that what this company is doing?  If not ... someone feel free to use this idea and make it happen.  You will be multi millionaires.  Please contact me though I'd love to be a part of the profits :)

That's kind of what i was thinking also - but the app stopped working yesterday.  And the app said "Invalid card" when it stopped working.  
The only card I had in there was my debit card, and it was now deleted.  The app does instant purchases.  And has done instant purchases for me numerous times.
Additionally, the ability to purchase instantly was now removed when I logged into the website too.  So Im sticking with my statement:   It was using my debit card for instant purchases, and they modified something to weed out the debit cards that never should've gotten through.

Major difference between ripple and pretty-much all the others you listed, including block stream, is that ripple has a marketing and sales force. 
I realize everyone in this space doesn't think that's necessary for success of a product. But surprise. It is.

There's that comment again. Just because it's easy to have it there, therefore everyone should leave it there. That's not how business owners think. If they add a feature, it mentally "puts them out".  They want results from it. If they don't get it, they will remove the feature.
Merchant adoption came when there was still no consumer incentive. And bitcoin is going to start getting dropped as a payment option if it's not being used. This is the thing I've been afraid of for three years.

Does this mentality acknowledge the concept of "staying ahead of the curve" ?   
Or the concept of "It's too slow and small so opportunities for adoption *today* get passed on to other protocols *today*, right now" ?   
I feel this nagging irritation every time I hear comments like these. They *seem* to imply that we should only be building capacity for what we need today.   
AND that "what we need today" is not determined by "what could be (today) if we had greater capacity".  
Nor by an analysis of "What the industry is wanting to do (today)".  
But that what we need today is actually being determined by the ridiculous notion that "what currently *is*... (hipster coffee buying) ...is all we really need". 
In short, there seems to be a massive, gaping, astronomical hole in the logic backing this mentality. 
What am I misunderstanding?

I remember that.   Wouldn't it make more sense that the price double though?  I was thinking of the math behind this earlier today.  Considering I failed 1st grade math, I didn't get very far.

@_date: 2015-02-25 19:24:32
That's what Lighthouse was supposed to fix.  In fact its core purpose was that.  How's that coming Lighthouse?  
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:59:56
I remember specifically reading that Lighthouse was supposed to be the savior of the age-old dilemma of lack of funding for new core developers, and financially covering existing core developers.  At one point they claimed it would bring numerous new developers on board and would result in much faster code development and faster evolution of Bitcoin.  Something it seriously needs.  
When I found out that it was nothing more than a crowd funding tool, I definitely got confused.  Based on the description, I thought it was going to be a tool specifically for training, recruiting, and funding core developers. A structured and planned system run by some important people, that would enable me to donate towards the recruits salaries. Not some generalized crowdfunding system that people could use to cover their kittens surgery on the block chain.  
When I found out that the only developer who was going to be making money from it was the guy who created it, starting a crowd funding campaign for himself, I got a little disillusioned about its ability to do any of the aforementioned, as that would require significant amount of organization and planning from several parties.   After all, it wasn't recruiting or funding developers.  Its just another type of generalized crowd funding site.  I doubted it would do anything to bring on new developers or speed up Bitcoins ability to evolve.  And now 3-4 months later, as I suspected, nobody has done anything close to what was described above, as far as I know. 
People keep saying "Well someone has to set up a crowdfunding effort for something like that!"   Yeah.  True.  But they could have done that on any crowd funding site.  Lighthouse was marketed as a system that would help Bitcoin core code evolve.  Turns out that was just Mike Hearn talking about getting paid for his time instead of doing it for free.

Do you actually run a business and have a merchant account with anyone? Looking at a companies pricing page is usually the tip of the iceberg.  Unless you are doing $50,000+ a month in sales through them you don't have a clue how things come out at the end of the month. 
Also:  it's almost as if ppl think there's only one company on planet earth and when you quote that companies rates, that's the only possible scenario that exists. You are aware there are other merchant service processors right? 
With my particular merchant service processor, I've confirmed and triple confirmed that after their fees, I'm looking at 6 to 8% on average for international rewards cards. It as heck isn't cheaper for international cards like you say. No idea where you got that information.

I've said it before and I will say it again. There is a reason why Developers should *not* be in control of product development priorities, naming, feature lists, or planning for a product. That is the job of the sales, marketing, and product development teams who actually *interface with the customer*. They are the ones who do the research and know what's needed for a product. They are the ones who are supposed to decide what things are called, what features come next, and how quickly shit gets out the door.
Bitcoin has none of that. You've got a Financial product, being created for a financial market, by a bunch of developers with *no* experience in finance, and (more importantly) absolutely *no way* for the market to have any input or control over what gets done, or what it's called.  That is crazy to me. 
Luke is a perfect example of why you don't give developers control over *anything* other than the structure of the code. 
They are not supposed to be making product development decisions. They are not supposed to be naming anything. And they definitely are not supposed to be deciding "what comes next" or how quickly things get done. In any other company, this process would be considered suicide.

I've made this claim many many times and that was always the response.  Nobody is going to drop Bitcoin due to lack of use because its free to have the option there.  On the contrary, sites re-evaluate the success of options they offer and remove them on a regular basis.  
My biggest fear has always been that Bitcoin adoption ends up taking too long and all this Merchant adoption begins to reverse.  The fact that its free to leave it there means absolutely nothing.  Companies streamline their websites and will remove dead features.

Welcome to Bitcoin.  Where, after 7.5 years, coders are still in charge of the user experience.  And now you see why they shouldn't be.  Your description reflects problems everyone has on every level of this technology.  My experiences included.  
It's embarrassing and irritating that there seems to be no concern or awareness for those who represent the business/marketing side of this technology.  But as long as this continues to be true, there will be no mass adoption of Bitcoin. 
Maybe one day everyone will wake the fuck up and realize that a product needs to be useful for real life humans or nobody will use it.  And the coders will finally step back and let the people who know how to make a product succeed in a market give them a task list, priority list, and enhancement list that they need to implement.

Okay so I guess technically if you don't like your bank, you don't like the dealings they have with the government. Or something. But still technically, I don't feel FU-ish towards government.  I'm not somebody who's going to waste a lot of mental effort obsessing on the fact the government needs to be overhauled. It's always. Always. Always going to be that way. Nobody is ever going to be satisfied with any government. 
Banks however, are private entities that are treating us like shit, and stealing money from us on the regular. I feel like that's a battle I can get behind, and one small enough that actually could be changed thanks to bitcoin. I don't hate Obama. I don't hate authority. And I don't think everybody in a position of power is corrupt. On the contrary, I think the distribution of corruption is 50% consumer, and 50% regulator. It's a human thing.

Really? Tell me about those clear, obvious, glaring reasons why "two souls become one spiritually?" 
Your entire premise is based on a superstition. Therefore your conclusion is hardly obvious.  
You try to make it sound like I'm violating the laws of God by wanting to protect my assets in case things don't work out. 
The whole "two become one" nonsense is why people get in this situation in the first place. I can't count the number of friends who ended up in horrible financial positions because they took that viewpoint on marriage. 
It's romantic, and it makes us feel good, but it's not realistic or rational.  You don't suddenly become impervious to break ups just because you get married.  
And the minute she walks out on you for being a pain in the ass too much, or meets someone she likes better, you find out that you're hardly "one".

 I want *you* to be right, believe me!!  
I just bought a ton at $673 and it has stalled.  For nearly a week.  Now we are 6 days away and zero movement.  So I think everyone is already "all in". 
As for whether the ACTUAL HALVING will cause a price increase outside of speculators or pumpers?  A lot of people say it won't because miners don't sell 100% of their coins daily.  
So there's an argument to be made that the price won't even move at all. However I do think over the next 6 to 12 months, there's going to be increasing pressure as the reduced supply of new coins compounds on itself each month.
But yeah, I want the price to spike like crazy. You better believe it's going to crash though at some point, before it levels out again. That much is guaranteed.  You just have to figure out where to call the top.
@_date: 2015-03-06 13:34:20
You are also using the faulty logic that "how things are now, is how they will always be". The problems with bitcoin can also be solved. Yet you ignore that, and instead focus on legacy banking systems somehow redoing their entire infrastructure. 
Additionally, there's a whole new world that will open up when people don't need to cash out. There will come a time when you can buy and sell / Pay for expenses etc. without converting to Fiat. The larger ecosystem gets, the more common it will be to operate within ecosystem exclusively. 
Again this takes very basic IQ to think slightly down the road a bit. It's not very difficult.

It's actually way more of a pain in the ass (to me) to arbitrarily pick a number and set a limit and just hope that it gets filled. 
You could be sitting there for hours. Or never see it filled. 
Plus large buy or sells DO influence the price, psychologically.  Why let everyone know that you're trying to sell $60,000 worth of coins and risk them freaking out?
It's always been a lot easier for me to just throw in one coin, three coins, two coins, five coins, and just be done with it in less than an hour.  The price never moves that way.

Sorry, what adoption?   After 8 years, still no regular people use Bitcoin for anything.  Not in commerce or regular life. It's still purely a trading / speculating tool.  After nearly 8 years it hasn't evolved into anything more. That's upsetting. 
No businesses ( even those that have explicitly expressed desire to, like Fidelity and NASDAQ) have been able to use it due to its lack of features and capacity limitations (aka "Fidelity Effect").  
Bitcoins biggest weakness as of today is it's complete and utter lack of adoption. And when one looks at the reason *why*, one comes full-circle to the very topic of this thread. Lack of features, lack of extensibility, and lack of capacity.
Now maybe you'll see why the "vocal minority" aren't really just a bunch of whining idiots.  They're concerned about a very important and severe problem:  
Opportunity Cost. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:31:09
Just because you use it doesn't mean 100,000 merchants worldwide are seeing a massive influx of consumer purchases.  Not sure how you even correlate the two in your mind.  They are obviously completely unrelated.  I run an online store and offer 10% off all my products if paid in Bitcoin.  I have had 1 purchase in 6 months with a daily order rate of about 20 orders.  Still, I wouldn't look at my personal experience as being indicative of the global situation.
So you look at the global indicators instead:
You will know when consumers begin using Bitcoin for commerce because the demand will skyrocket and so will the price.  That is your first solid indicator that things have not yet taken off.  Price is stagnant.  Secondly, we have numerous reports from merchants like Overstock and several others stating that bitcoin purchases have underperformed.  WordPress recently removed the payment option entirely, presumably due to lack of use.  Things like this (but mostly the lack of increased demand) prove that consumers are not yet using this to any relevant level.
Merchant adoption came on quick and strong, but I do feel it was too early.  There's no usecase or incentive for the average joe to use Bitcoin in the first place, and its still too difficult.  I do believe consumers would hop on board more if they realized they could buy online with no fear of credit card or identity theft.  That's a big incentive for a lot of people - just look how many people use PayPal because they think its safer?  
So we do know that consumers jump through hoops for security reasons.  Someone just needs to sell that point to the consumer public with Bitcoin, and nobody really is.  Not to mention Bitcoin is not like PayPal.  Paypal came on the scene as secure and safe from day 1.  Bitcoin has conveyed to the public ("Thanks Karpeles!") that its not safe.  So now we have a major PR problem making people jump through any hoops at all.

The claim that the pump was a result of whales automatically makes your statement relevant to the current price situation.  Because it means those whales and China simply "aren't bothering" to get rich anymore.  
So the claim that it was genuine free market activity seems obviously false.  If that were the case, it would be happening over and over again.  And it's not.  The pump was the result of something very specific happening one time only.  Whales don't play only once.  And China doesn't gamble and then stop.

No idea.   I'm not a huge fan of small groups of individuals meeting behind closed doors to decide *anything* about Bitcoin, without the involvement of a larger subset of the industry.  Seems diametrically opposed to the entire M.O.  
Then again, there wasn't supposed to be only 5 miners in the first place.   I'd love to see how Bitcoin would look today if you, and I, and another 50,000 individual people were the "miners who decided things", as Satoshi initially intended. 
Can't meet behind closed doors in a situation like that.  And probably a good thing.

There's quite a few people in the financial industry who are chuckling at the fact that our battle-torn peace of mind now rests upon centralized, regulated entities. Because quite a few people said that wasn't where bitcoin was going.  I realize everyone here is all about the free market and no regulation, but we've seen where that's gotten us. 
According to people like Andreas, it's because there is no system in place that *fully eliminates* the need for trust yet. Hopefully somebody is working on such an infrastructure because otherwise, the only solution is regulation to prevent fraud and scams continuing.

Why do people keep saying this when we all know they were fined billions of dollars?   I mean seriously.  Just because they didn't physically move from their living room to a brick room with a bunk bed, the punishment didn't happen at all?  
When its an individual, you tend to see people going to jail.  Example:  Bernie Madoff.  Companies tend to be fined.  Maybe because there are so many people involved, and its not as simple and stupid as "Joe at CHASE bank is the one responsible for this whole thing".  Do they just round up everyone in HR and corral them into a holding cell for 30 years? The implication is that "nothing was done", and that is complete nonsense.

Microsoft introduced MSN Search in 1998, the same year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google. Google was fast, innovative, and good at delivering relevant results. MSN Search was none-of-the-above.
Microsoft hadn’t even bothered to develop a search engine of their own. They used results from Inktomi, an existing search engine. Search simply wasn’t a priority. Microsoft was more focused on defeating Netscape Navigator in a battle of the browsers.

Fail.  Bitcoin is HTTP (1990). Or TCP/IP (1982). 
Bitcoin is not a web browser. 
"Genesis Block" equivalent in Internet terms happened in 1969 when Arpanet carried it's first packets. 
Amazon opened business in 1995. 
26 years later.  
And Amazon did not become notable as a business until 1997 when they IPO'd.

I had this idea recently. But didn't run with it unfortunately. 
There's going to come a time where a lot of online merchants are allowing bitcoin as a payment option. And a lot of them are just going to be fake storefronts. Pretending to sell things, while grandma Sally thanks it's actually going to get shipped. And it doesn't. 
There is going to be a rating system needed for merchants. I don't understand why they're using Facebook and Twitter, but I guess that could be a supplemental method. Nothing stopping somebody from creating a fake Facebook account for a company. 
I think straightforward ratings from consumers who actually receive their shipments, is a 100% foolproof method for legit ratings.

There's nothing delusional about it. The rise is fully justified. Just not in the way that you expect. 
It's not due to organic adoption or use. It's because people are losing faith in bitcoin, and taking a chunk of their holdings and putting it over there. 
I appreciate Greg, his intentions, and his expertise. But you can't run a development project like this with no input from outside sources. This is why all the trash talking about Vitalik being "King" makes no sense to me. There's no difference in Bitcoin. Both have a relatively small doorway which final decisions are allowed through. 
But the gatekeeper over there actually seems to understand a multitude of viewpoints and uses common sense to try and make adjustments when it's reasonable to do so.  He seems to listen to the community and non-technical professionals who may have skill sets that he doesn't - like marketing, usability, etc. End-users and use-cases matter.  These things seem to be staggeringly ignored in bitcoin. 
This is why people are diversifying, and investors are throwing their money there, instead of here. It's a harsh reality, but sticking your head in the sand and pretending it's not happening, isn't doing anyone any favors.

Disagree.  There are some "purists" who have become infuriated over a centralized company with investors calling *any* shots in Bitcoin development - and as a result they have emotionally begun rejecting any and every idea that comes out of that institution.  That minority would say Layer 2 should not exist, but this is a crazy minority, even on the other sub.
But literally 100% of the rest will actively and enthusiastically acknowledge the benefits of Layer 2 systems.  I don't get why people like you need to paint false realities like this all the time.  Are you hoping to dupe those too lazy to research?
In any case, the problem here in Szabo's comment are the terms "cant" and "need".  You *cant* do that and you *need* layer 2.  These individuals believe there should be a strong and robust Layer 1 transaction system as well. 
 There will always be "power users" who wont want to trust a 3rd party (remember when that was the definition of Bitcoin?  wtf....) and well into the future the freedom to transact peer-to-peer should be protected.  
Even my completely clueless (about Bitcoin) financial advisor readily acknowledged that the Govt doesn't have its nose in hundreds of millions of peer to peer cash transactions even today, and Bitcoin should be able to operate the same way.  If I give you $5, I don't need anyone's permission to do so.  
I struggle to understand why both cant (and shouldn't) coexist.

I don't understand this.  They commit to flat fees now.  If you look at their pricing - its all flat fee now.  I have heard no mention of them retaining the right to increase those fees.  You've got sites like Shopify.com that also have flat fee pricing, and they can't just raise the rates.  That seems to be the new "thing" and Bank of America just hasn't figured it out yet.  Are you sure you're on one of the more recent plans that they are offering?  
Its as simple as this:  
And with that, I'm looking at saving nearly 30% in merchant fees every month, which works out to about $1200 for me.

And how you continued to rant, until I reiterated: "We agree."   To which you replied:  *"Whoops. Nevermind then"*


Devs are creating something that needs to be useful for lay people.  I only speak in general terms about industry needs.  I never talk about myself.  I talk from the perspective of what it takes to bring products to market, and to see them succeed. All that hard work is irrelevant if the idiotic, entitled public doesn't use the product. Eventually, somebody has to use your product. Yea?
As for my posting style:  I don't whine.  I raise issues that I think need to be discussed.  Issues that I feel are being ignored.  That's always been my M.O. 
I say unpopular things in both subs.  But only when I feel it's rational to do so.  That's why you and I agreed on something last week.  I'm happy to know that I put a bug in people's ear about certain issues.  Got the conversation going again.  Once it starts coming up on its own, I tend to step back and let everyone discuss. 
I understand your frustration, but respectfully, I believe you and several other developers suffer from the same complex I've seen from developers over the last 20 years: a lack of perspective outside of your own world. Everyone else is considered a misguided idiot. You guys know best. You're smarter and superior to everyone. 
The reality is, when you're in the real world, it's the programming team who is forced to adhere to task lists created by someone who interacts with the idiotic masses, because it's the idiotic masses who either use the product, or walk.  
Usability, UX, timelines, enhancement / bug prioritization, scope creep, deliverables, milestones are all based on the needs of the end-users. In the real world.  But not in Bitcoin.  In the real world, programmers have no say in literally any part of the process, outside of "technical limitations". 
That's as far as their authority goes. And there's a reason for that. It's because they have absolutely zero interaction with the people they are creating the product for. And quite often they have little or no or knowledge of the market it's being used in.
So while I respect your perspective, and the technical knowledge you bring to the table, it would be great if the people in your camp had the capacity to respect the perspective of those who actually sell the shit that you guys make. Because like I said above, if nobody's using your product, it doesn't matter how much work you put into the code.
Anyways.  Happy Halving.

You also have to upload documents to them, but you can get that going now.
Just a word of advice though, if you're trying to make some cash off of the halving, I'm not sure if you'll be able to do that at this stage. 
I do believe right now that it is "priced in". I think the spike was at $780 a week or two ago.
What you are going to see now, is the actual halving take place.  Followed by a few days / week where people see that the price doesn't go higher (because we've already pumped it to nearly double what it was).  
At that point those people will probably pull out, and you will see the price crash. It may take between one and four months after that, for the new "higher average price due to the halving" to be realized. 
So if you're getting in now, and it still spikes, then awesome. It may still do that.  But if you're getting in now, you may need to wait up to six months to see a profit.

Yes but doesn't the self-correcting mechanism always kick in? The risk of a 51% attack goes down because more people are hopping back on board (with their CPU's if it goes low enough!) and mine. Centralization of mining decreases. 
More importantly : why is everyone forgetting the fact that if a 51% attack occurred, it would be noticed in minutes, and stopped? 
Even with a 100% risk of a 51% attack, it wouldn't go anywhere or cause any damage.  So it's a complete non issue.  Still should be fixed though

You're taking me too literal and missing the analogy I'm drawing.  Bitcoin is a product and it does have customers.  Figuratively.  
Or you're of the opinion that it's done evolving.  It's a store of value with a limited supply, and that's all it will ever be.  
Satoshi didn't decree which viewpoint is the proper one.  That's why there's a divide in the community.  But he did clearly say it can and should scale to visa capacities, on chain.  At least as per an email sent to Mike Hearn. Bewilders the shit out of me that people disregard his statements in that email.  Oh well.

Update:  Jenny's iPad is covered in cobwebs and no Bitcoin sales for 2 years.  One customer tried buying with Bitcoin but his wallet app didn't match hers and it wouldn't send. 
After 5 minutes it seemed to work but confirmations were taking too long and people behind him in line started yelling.  As he ran away in shame he was heard crying and screaming:  "It's only been 7 years!!  Bitcoin has only been around seven years!!"

Nevermind found it:  Under "TOOLS" there's an option for Recurring Transactions where you can cancel them or set up new ones.   
The site unfortunately doesn't have ETH or LTC on the list when setting up new ones, so you have to do it from the purchase screen.

Yes there is something wrong with that, "Reddit User for 4 Days". 
Yet another person who is brand-new and promoting the narrative that bitcoin doesn't have to be a cheap, frictionless worldwide currency.  
Fascinating isn't it? Who stands to benefit from Bitcoin not taking over the monetary system?  Let's think about that for moment....
Yes. There is a problem with bitcoin not being used as a currency. For one small reason: it was made to be a fucking currency. 
I don't know who you people are with your brand-new Reddit accounts all over the this sub, but it's getting pretty obvious at this point. 
And I'm the furthest from a conspiracy theorist, but this is getting ridiculous. 
Folks - be aware of which multibillion dollar industries stand to lose from bitcoin. And what they might do to change the mindset of its users.

Just out of curiosity. Do you reject the published email from Satoshi Nakamoto clearly stating that he sees bitcoin scaling to Visa level proportions transaction-wise?

Yes I've been hearing it for years. Everyone who disagrees with you is a non-technical village idiot. Those village idiots have effectively handed your asses to you for the last year and a half, though haven't they? 
Damn that must hurt your monstrously overinflated ego. 
Over 40,000 subscribers on a sub that you've deluded yourself into thinking is a "tiny minority of stupid people" have stopped you from making fundamental changes to the definition and identity of Bitcoin.  
You guys hit a brick wall.  A brick wall made up of people with brains, opinions, and perceptions grounded in the White Paper.  Turns out, it wasn't just a small idiotic minority after all. 
If you guys are the ones in the right, and the holders of all truth, then ***you really suck at convincing everybody else***.
Actual forward progress this week, for the first time in a year and a half, because a tiny minority of idiots got what they asked for. (SegWit2x). 
It must really irritate you that damn White Paper is still publicly available to be read by people with brains. Just kills your whole ability to flip reality ass backwards doesn't it.  
As it turns out, a whole ***shit ton*** of people disagree with you. Like literally tens of thousands.  
Here's the greatest part about being right. You can talk all the shit you want. I get to point to what actually transpires.   What is actually happening in the field.  You failed to change the narrative.  You lost the battle.  You conceded and were forced to compromise.  You had to lose your ego and actually work together with others. That must really piss you off. 
Because a bunch of retarded drooling idiots slapping their wrists on their chests beat you. Now how the hell did that happen?  Unfortunately my friend, it's your perception that is skewed.  Not 40,000 other people.

Vault is not insured.  Just asked them recently.  The only benefit is that they allow double email confirmations before money is moved. So it's really just a way of saying "we've added a couple more safeguards against theft". 
The other important thing to know about the vault, is that if you try to withdraw (move coins to your wallet on Coinbase where you can actually do stuff with them) you have to wait a minimum of 48 hours before you get access to your own funds.  You can't buy or sell directly from the vault. 
That was a huge pain in my ass a couple weeks ago because I wasn't aware of that until I had initiated the withdrawal.  When you want to sell, waiting 2 solid days is torture.

They're not shady.  They're just going (way way) above and beyond to avoid criticism from regulators.  And we can opt for a different service if we prefer not to participate.  
Although I honestly don't know where else to go.  
Bitstamp has WAY lower fees.  But they require the same intrusive ridiculous personal privacy invasions. And I'm not resorting to Local Bitcoins because I'm not willing to pay the absurd surpluses on everything. 
So what do power users do?   Find a buddy with a million bitcoins and hope he's always willing to sell you some, or buy some from you at market price?

Whats it like living in a world where everyone who disagrees with you is a dishonest, horrible person who will screw you the second they're given the chance to?   
These people are wanting the best for Bitcoin, as well as their businesses, just like Blockstream.  Everyone does what they think is "right" based on their understanding and perceptions.  
Very Very Very few people are "doctor evil" and inherently out to fuck everyone for their own benefit.  Even to the point of destroying Bitcoin.  In fact I'd dare say nobody in this space is thinking that way.  So why does this sub continually try to paint that narrative?

I bought a bunch of GPUs for mining alt coins back when they were cool, and when the price of Bitcoin was $900. 
I'm now selling those GPUs for $180, and collecting 0.8 BTC with every one.  
I originally spent about $7000 on mining equipment. I have now banked nearly 15 BTC selling it.  At $900 that's nearly $14,000.  So I'm definitely appreciating how much BTC I'm getting for my money compared to before!

@_date: 2017-06-13 00:13:07


For whatever reason? 
Allow me to school you on a little bit of history. People asked for scaling as far back as 2012.  I was there and saw it. They were told to shut up by the Core devs.  I was told to shut up. Everyone was told to relax, because "bitcoin is just fine and doesn't need it yet". 
I remember being laughed at, and told that I needed to chill out because "the sky isn't falling". The lack of foresight back then was driving me batty.
Yet they were still telling people to shut up and relax as recent as the beginning of 2016. It wasn't until everyone started losing their shit, and alternate clients started popping up, that they sluggishly and grudgingly agreed to include scaling in SW.  
By that time, the entire community was already divided, and there were multiple alternate clients people were rallying behind. 
Now it's too late. Now the community is fed up. Feels burned.  Is confused why 2 or 3 people are making the decisions for everyone. And they want them out.  When you get ignored for four straight years, you make other plans. That's how people work.
Now with that accurate information in mind, who's to blame for the situation we are in right now?
