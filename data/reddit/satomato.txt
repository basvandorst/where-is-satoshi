After the fork we will have **the same balance on both chains**, so it would be natural to expect a price drop for coins on the old chain at switch over. There will be no price drop prior due to an increase in demand to get in on the "doubling" action. A new client must be released prior to switch over that can track both balances. Price equilibrium will be regained by the coins on the new chain gaining value at the expense of coins on the old chain reducing in value. If you do nothing you should still end up with comparable value on the new chain.

LISTEN! The prosecutors by their own admission asked for a harsh penalty to make an example of Ulbricht. This is unconstitutional and against the the concept of equal justice for all. It is so obviously wrong it is laughable. Am I the only one that finds this wrong? C'mon people!!! Selling liquor or guns is the same as selling drugs. People should take responsibility for their own usage. This is the government taking revenge at someone daring to defy their stupid laws. If you are incompetent and unable to apply laws with reasonable fines then jack up the sentences... Simply hit hard and it looks like you are doing your job well. Way to go! The aim of any sentence should never be to satisfy hatred or get back at someone but instead to help and reform. A life is too precious to waste in this way. Even murderers should be reformed if at all possible. Stop hating.

If the government lays down a road and criminals use the road to get to where they commit their crimes does that mean the government acts as a king pin? Can the government claim they are unaware of the crimes being committed using their infrastructure? Is virtual infrastructure somehow to be treated differently? Aren't they supposed to be tracking down the actual criminals instead? We can't close down our cities to prevent crimes from being committed.

Everyone deserves a second chance.

How is it that the laws do not reflect the opinions of the majority of people. Is this something block chain technology can help fix? BTW this judge is a pawn of the government.

It most likely are their guilty consciences in relation to their parenting that they are trying to change after the fact by destroying another life. Parents often embark on crusades like this when racked with guilt.

The key word is "alledgedly".

Ulbricht deserves a second chance especially if he has no prior convictions. He did a stupid thing but shows a willingness to change. Everyone deserves a second chance. I value the life of a single wrongdoer that shows a willingness to change above the lives of people that show no mercy. Put the merciless in jail and on death row. I am fine with that.

Whenever punishment outweighs a crime it should become a punishable offence. You don't let your daughter sleep out in the cold for talking back at you... All the "big" people here saying he should have received the death penalty are immature idiots trying to look impressive.

It does not appear that justice has been served even handedly in this case. Murderers have gotten much less severe sentences in the past. As far as I know nothing has been proven that ties him to anything that serious.

The most convincing arguments seem to be the unproven ones... Even if true these people would have been blackmailing him and no actual deaths occurred which would have given credence to the allegations. Murderers who had actually committed murders in much more aggressive manner have received lesser sentences. This is all about making an example of him in an in-equal justice for some manner...
