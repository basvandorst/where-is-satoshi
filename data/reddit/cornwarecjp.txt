Exactly. The way I see it, we are currently developing different prototypes in parallel, and some of these will result in production-quality implementations.
Right now, we're still in the business of gathering experience in what will work and what won't. The different prototypes are based on different assumptions, so they speak somewhat different protocols (at least my Amiko Pay has its own protocol). In the end, concepts will hopefully converge, and we can agree on a common protocol.
In the mean time (or in the long run, if ideas somehow don't converge), it is possible to use bridging software to interconnect the different networks. There's already enough similarity that I'm confident this will be possible.

Amiko Pay WILL be a Lightning Network implementation. It just happens to be a more flexible framework in which IOU links are also possible. Initially it will start with IOU links (easier to implement), but eventually I expect that trust-free Lightning-style channels will be the dominant mode of operation.
So, you really should count Amiko Pay as one of the Lightning Network implementations currently under construction.
(Note: I am the author of Amiko Pay.)

In no particular order:
1: The "Blockstream" implementation. Language: C
2: The "Lightning" implementation. Language: Go
3: The "Thunder network". Language: Java
4: "Eclair". Language: SCALA
5: "Amiko Pay". Language: Python
So that's at least five projects.
