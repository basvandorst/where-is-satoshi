From experience, localbitcoins is fastest by far - maybe 30 minutes if you know what you're doing

First rule of crypto: Don't put in more than you can afford to lose.
You should just assume the money is gone.

What exactly is a hardware wallet? I'm using electrum right now, do I need to change anything?

+1 vote for localbitcoins.
You'll pay a pretty big markup, but you can have as many coins as you want within a day

I'd give it a few weeks.
Feels like the price has been rising too fast lately, and the last time that happened it fell off a cliff shortly after (im still salty).

You can find someone with good rating, IM them your ID details and get bitcoin within 10 minutes.

The train that carries bitcoin transactions to their destinations just got significantly larger, thus people don't need to fight so hard to get their transactions on the train before it leaves.
Is my understanding of it anyway

way cheaper to just buy a BTC
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:01:01
you send bitcoin to it and it spews out cash, and vice versa
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:30:52
hardly any BTC, unless you are carting in a server rack of machines or something.

Never heard of the bitbills, but cassius coins are very rare collectable items now and worth a lot

Writing your $70k+ seed in a physical wallet...?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:26:55
any reason why?
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:01:24
probably for the same reason as BCH, it's not 'bitcoin'
