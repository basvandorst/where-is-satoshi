I don't have a credit card so I can't use instant. How was the process getting circle verified they took 3 days to link my bank account and now they said they would deposit a small amount of money in my account for me to verify but they still haven't and support won't respond to me until monday.

I was trying to find a highly rated exchange that users here could vouch for. If I googled it a couple months ago mt gox would show up and they are a terrible exchange, I just wanted to find a good exchange to support.
