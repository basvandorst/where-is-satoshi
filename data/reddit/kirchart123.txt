I know that .. but in gold mining, the "main cost" is all of the specialized hardware equipment, but seems like in bitcoin mining the main cost is the electric bill. That's why I'm so curious, i was thinking on investing less than $2k usd and see what happens. I'm a web designer so, for me its much more viable to get into bitcoins instead of gold.

have you any number to contact coinbase? I just send them an email .. but I would like a phone number.

Sorry for that, as you can see, English is not my native language. By building I was referring to my apartment/house.
I don't need to have "access" in work hours, I have all of my electric expenses covered, they just need to came from my apartment/house where I don't get any electric bills delivered.

Its funny because "rabo" means ass in spanish .. so the name of the bank is like "ass bank" or "banco del culo" once you translated it. 
... seems legit.

Neeat! Time to get some bitches and stuff
@_date: 2013-10-01 01:37:07
Because of the hardware costs Einstein.

I call bs on that, there are plenty of ways to get cash for them, you are just not that sure about that crash
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:55:23
oh, thanks for the info
@_date: 2013-09-30 23:09:31
This is exactly the kind of answer i was looking for .. so yeah, it seems like the best deal is to setup a good computer with good graphic cards and go with  "the flavor of the month" instead of buy specialized equipment intended just for bitcoins.
I'm still reading and checking out which scenario fits better. Thanks for your time sir.

it worked?.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:10:44
So are the rewards. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:02:01


I'm glad I learned that around $200's
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:05:57
I'm waiting to break the $1k to see if we have momentum .. I bet it will go to $1300's once we pass the 4 digits barrier.
With some luck, some other people are doing this at different targets.

Its funny because I got $300 USD in bitcoins for no reason at coinbase 10 days ago, the transaction was "pending" for a while, and it was processed on friday.
Now my $300 are worth more than $800.  Awww yeah!.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:02:43
Congrats :). I just did the same, first bitcoins were delivered just today but the transaction was "pending" at the price of 10 days ago ($300). Crazy.

Well, I'm 27yr engineer, who is single and living alone... as opposed to most of my co-workers who are older, with 4+ family members living in the same house.
My energy consumption is WAY LESS than most of the people with same "free electricity benefit". I'm 110% sure I can manage to have my energy consumption to the same level as my peers because I have no family size/consumption fridge, dryer, water heather, air condition, lights, rooms and electric stove.

I use google chrome, I think its the same that I used for Icloud.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:36:55
can we know what kind of stuff are you selling on your website?. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:17:54
looks pretty nice, keep the good work!
@_date: 2013-09-30 21:16:59
Hello sir, Its no "steal". Its a legal benefit which all of the people who works for the official "electric company" in my country has.
Maybe its considering "steal" where you live, but in my city its a legal benefit, just like a bonus or incentive.
I did some research on bitcoins, but I went for some second opinions before spending real money.. thanks for your time anyways :).
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:23:38
just kinda curious, why do you tip him?.
@_date: 2013-10-01 01:41:48
I AM part of the electric company, that's why i get the benefit.
AND, since is a goverment institution and not a "normal business" like in the rest of the world its kinda impossible for them to fire me. 
AND if they notice, by law, they MUST give me 3 warnings and time to "adapt" my self to the new conditions (to pay for my electric bills). 
If i do nothing by the 3rd warning they CAN remove my benefit but they CAN'T fire me for that reason.
@_date: 2013-09-30 23:57:47
This is the kind of insight i was looking for, can you please specify what kind of equipment where you using for that consumption?.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:45:51
must be terrorism.
@_date: 2013-09-30 23:02:31




@_date: 2013-09-30 23:11:20
Yes, seems like i have a "limit" on my consumption, but in my conditions I'm very far from it.

and then, a while later you will realize you wasted to much time just watching the graph going down and up without doing anything about it.
