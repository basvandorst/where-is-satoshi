So knowing bitcoin can help you become a millionaire, even with fiat money.

I hope they open one here in Davao Philippines, but I highly doubt it.

Love the name, it's like a fight club, for ramen.

Sure I'll take his money, and exchange it for bitcoin :P

If only I knew how to play this game correctly.

Thanks you much for this.

Probably take less than 5 years.

I personally don't mind women who post online pictures of themselves naked but the thing that I don't get about r/girlsgonebitcoin is why do people tip? Maybe I don't get this because I'm not a man, but these women already have their pictures up completely naked, I've seen the goods, why do I have to pay? *shrugs*

Bitcoin is my precious little secret.

You should be a proud pervert.

If you can't tell people you have money then how will you explain your bills being paid and you don't even leave your room? People will ask questions.
Me: I have an online job.
People: Doing what?
Me: uhhhhhhhh...

I can't seem to make a publishers account.

It's the first thing I looked at today, and I was like 0_o.

Now I can thank them for all the free por- TV shows and insightful documentaries that they host.

I hate Chase, I'm thinking of closing my account with them.
@_date: 2013-04-21 09:11:07
People with bitcoins will know what it is.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:25:34
Yes! It's very difficult for me since I don't live in the United States and I can't easily do bank transfers to get bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:43:11
This is the stuff that I'm afraid of, but I've tried coinmama which uses paypal and I haven't been scammed by them. You're always taking a risk using paypal though. Hopefully this will be fixed once the paypal president finally decides to implement bitcoin with paypal.

I contacted them and got an email back.
