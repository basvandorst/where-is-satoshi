you are right. but what do you think of China? Its mining facilities and their electricity prices.

I am sure, China because of its population and density has a consumption of immense energy. Givven that fact, mining facilities have a good spot in China, that is my opinion.

Don't worry my fellas, this ''pain'' is not a long term situation. All Cryptos, Bitcoin most of all will rise as never before.

I ilke, how bitcoin works, i love blockchain but since it was formed from a crisis , I don't think it is mandatory to celebrate, but i think exchanges and platforms that sell and trade with bitcoin will.

I think, sir, that you and i and everyone else will witness an even bigger drop of the bitcoin before any good rise so brace yourselves.

My personal opinion is that it will succeed if and only if it will be into this . Victory for them will be assured if they will manage to get this thing going and forget about second plans. This should be their main priority.

Yes, sadly it is, but the worst part is that there isn't going to be a change until the end of the year, many predicted.

I am canadian too and i was searching long-time for a friendly platform and a simple one to buy crypto. You can google bitcannuk. The platform is canadian and one thing i liked very much is that you can keep the coins on their platform for free if you want.I didn't store them though; i transfered them to my wallet. For example i bought ether and i am verry satisfied.
