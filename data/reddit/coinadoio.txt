Users of Coinado use the service for some of the same reasons people get VPNs and seed boxes. They want to offload torrenting for either bandwidth reasons (torrenting is slow or blocked on their home connection) or privacy reasons and/or they don't want to keep their machine busy with uploading and rather let a server "in the cloud" handle that (i.e. pay-as-you-go seed box).

Wait... so your original point was that the service is shitty and unneeded and now you are switching to calling me incompetent instead? That's ad hominem, but whatever.
As every professional software developer knows (and I am one, regardless of what you may think) a bug can reach a "needs more info" state. I tried to reproduce this on multiple platforms and was unable to do so. How do you propose I debug a bug that I cannot reproduce? I'm fortunate to have a very tech-savvy user base, so that's why I'm reaching out to them. It might be some small thing, or it might be fixed by now - hard for me to verify without being able to reproduce it. I haven't actually had any problem reports in a long while, but it's still documented just in case - you know, like a professional would do it. ;-)
But anyway, I feel we have a different understanding on how to have a civil discussion online. So I'm out of here.

Point taken, private tracker support is on the roadmap, but it'll be a while probably. PM sent!

I'm afraid Windows isn't really supported at the moment. You might be able to get things working, if you don't mind a bit of tinkering. The general idea would be:
1. Open  in your browser. You will see a bunch of text which is the Coinado script. Somewhere in there is "ACCOUNT = " and behind it a fresh account key. Note this account key down somewhere.
2. Open  key here&gt; in your browser. Add your account key from above, so that you have something like this:  .
You should now see details about your account, including a Bitcoin address which you can use to fund the account.
3. Now open in your browser a link of this form:  info hash&gt;/auto?u=&lt;account key here&gt; This should result in your browser starting a download for the largest file in the torrent specified by the info hash and charge it to your account.
Hope that helps! I'll PM you a coupon anyway, but that would be even trickier to redeem on Windows, as you need to make a POST request to  with the parameters u=&lt;account key&gt; and coupon=&lt;coupon code&gt; . Not sure how to best do that with standard Windows tools.

You pay for the whole file at once (it's $0.05 per GB). Ideally I would like to break it down even further, but I'm not quite sure what the best approach within 21's framework is. They kind of assume a one-to-one mapping between http requests and payments, as far as I can tell. One could maybe artificially break down the transfer into lots of small http requests and each one would use http range headers to download only part of a file. The underlying infrastructure at Coinado supports ranged requests, but that currently isn't exposed in this 21 wrapper. Artifically creating lots of small http requests seems like a hack though and is probably not great for throughput either.


Unfortunately not, you would have to pay again. Not sure what 21's proposal is on how to deal with stuff like that. I guess I could send a refund for the part that hasn't been downloaded yet and then the client would need to be smart enough to only request the missing piece when it attempts again (requiring http range requests again - see above).


Mostly just curiousity and trying to make sense of 21's value proposition. Our normal service works with plain Bitcoin addresses ( see  ). There you would do this:
    wget 
    chmod a+x coinado
    ./coinado balance # will display a Bitcoin address to deposit to
    ./coinado torrent 42ade26404772e26f1de2111b317f6543b51be0e
So with our normal offering you deposit some funds beforehand and then your balance is decreased for every byte you download. So in that case it's more fine-grained and if you only download half a file, you only pay half of it. And you can pick up at any point via http range requests, so resuming a download works as well.
This 21 wrapper doesn't have these features, but it isn't really meant to be "production ready" - just playing around with it. I agree that 21's off-chain payments are the least interesting part of it, because obviously just putting a central database somewhere makes it easy, but then you are back to the Paypal model. Then their API also supports on-chain payments, but that just has too much overhead for this usecase. If you download 1 GB files for 5 cents and then pay another cent in transaction costs, you have 20 % overhead and that isn't really practical.
So the most interesting part would be their announced support for payment channels. I think that could be very valueable to have a clear standard on how two machines initiate a payment channel for a service like this. You would still need to commit funds to it, but with the advantage that you can get them back, if something goes wrong. This still leaves the question though on how to best do metered payments per byte transferred, instead of per http request. As I said, 21 is currently set up on the assumption of the latter and I'm not sure that framework is flexible enough. I'm thinking it might be better to use the HTTP endpoint as a way to bootstrap - let's say - a websocket connection over which you would then continously exchange "mini invoices" and payments for them for the API calls that you make going forward. Or maybe that's overengineered, I don't know, we'll have to see.
