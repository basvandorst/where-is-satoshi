these are good looking cars.
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:31:25
will do, thanks.

because it's totally unregulated and I've heard of people being scammed out of their money, if not worse. Whether those claims were true or not I have no idea, better safe than sorry though.
Thanks for your insightful and helpful reply tho, I suggest to drop the elitism down a notch if you want more people getting into bitcoins.

my thoughts exactly.

What's a "paper wallet"? A service offered by "Electrum"?
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:27:05
these are all great answers.

went to bed expecting to wake up with BTC well under under 400 US $ but it's still at 600+...
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:21:23
this sounds....very convincing. Get his comment up top everyone.
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:30:33
lots of astoundingly helpful comments, gotta admit, this is truly a great subreddit and community.

ok, let's assume that I was about to purchase x amount of bitcoins from a guy through a face to face transaction, what would I actually need?
I guess a code/deposit address/wallet to store them
How would the transaction work? Like, I give him the cash, then my...address and he then proceeds to tranfer the bitcoins on it?
How do wallets work (address code + password?) and what's the safest way to store bitcoins?

huh, where in Italy exactly? That's a bit vague.

which somewhat proves that, as it currently stands, bitcoins aren't yet ready for mainstream-usage, 99% of the people out there aren't willing to go through hours worth of googling just to use a virtual currency (correlated with plenty of underlying inherent risks no less) that, for what we know, may or may not disappear tomorrow.
I swear it LOOKS (I'm very well aware it's not but let's just put things into perspective) like the most ridiculous scam ever several times over to the layman's untrained eye. 
"Get Lindencoins on some shady Second Life related website then turn them into Shitcoins at  then open an account at  and trade SHTC with BTC by meeting up with a guy on the street"...are you effin kidding me. Whith such premise I'm flabbergasted bitcoins even made it this far honestly and the 1st time I asked about them (several months ago) that's more or less the explanation I was given (things have gotten better lately though).
Whoever is in charge of them should make them easier to get (both to understand and purchase/trade) with the aid of the community, then they'd prolly become unstoppable because the concept behind them is nothing short of brilliant.

bro, I'm glad that you're getting off of trolling and name-calling people from behind a computer screen, well-hidden behind a veil of anonymity, gotta vent off that repression somewhere, must've had a pretty miserable and depressing life thus far to turn out like this. :)
Now kindly fuck off my thread, no one's forcing you to read it at gunpoint either. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:23:05
yeah, definitely going that route, perhaps I'll buy 100 EUR first and then add some at a later time.
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:17:46
more like, I believe bitcoins will be playing a huge role in online transactions in the near future and I want to hop aboard before everyone else realizes so (I'm already a few years late anyway).
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:04:03
except email is actually thousands of times better and faster than regular mail, what does BTC do that much better than regular currencies?
Honest question, I have no idea, just trying to figure out whether your analogy is feasible or not.
@_date: 2014-01-19 11:46:43
oh wow that localbitcoins site is awesome, can't believe there's that many people willing to sell bitcoins i my tiny town.
Well, that was really helpful, tanks.
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:18:47


well, considering that at this point Bitcoin isn't much more than a clever pyramid/ponzi scheme, yes. You should be welcoming newcomers with open wide arms.
I strongly believe it's gotten a huge potential for being revolutionary, given enough time and support, though, which is why I'm interested.
