I just logged in successfully now, can confirm it was down.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:21:46
Sure. Just let me get my alternative account real quick.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:24:57
Magic, ladies and gentlemen.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:21:17
Check your Bitcoin address on block explorers.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:05:53
Can confirm. Looks like the site is down for maintenance. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:22:39
Very intense. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:11:58
Thank you for the photo, I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:12:32
Son of a BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:23:17
Just logged in successfully. Looks like the site was overloaded with users. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:30:12
If you have the private keys, you should be fine. We don't know much for now. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:25:16
Obviously a moderator of a Minecraft server. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 14:14:41
Your old address is still valid. Wallet services usually provide you with multiple addresses to protect your privacy and make it hard for online attackers to trace you.
@_date: 2017-07-10 08:00:49
You can ban the node from your core wallet if you find them suspicious.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:10:52
Definitely a troll. Craig Wright is a big fraud.
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:52:14
He probably missed the train. Unlucky him.
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:25:59
Absolutely correct. You earned a medal.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:19:34
Use a wallet where you control the private keys. For now I suggest you to use a [paper wallet]( If you have the private keys, and a hard fork is coming, you should have the same amount of coins on both chains. Don't transact until workflows emerge to protect you from playback attacks, just to be safe.
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:03:40
Because of the uncertainty over August 1. People are also panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:59:05
I have a feeling people are panic selling because of the whole August 1 thing.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:33:41
I don't think it's steady at all. Wild fluctuations might occur after August 1 in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:11:52
Retire. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:51:08
No. Nodes and miners are completely different things. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:29:31
Yes it's indeed possible, but very unlikely. Meanwhile the value of fiat slowly decreases. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:16:24
You should transfer your BTC to a wallet where you have access to your private keys. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:34:47
Online wallets for now are not safe to store Bitcoins because they might only go for one chain. Unless you have access to the private keys, you'll have coins on both sides. If you don't have the keys, you don't own the coins.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:30:29
I'm no expert, but I'd say Litecoin, AntShares and Steem. @_date: 2017-07-09 17:06:05
Exactly. That's why I said "I'm sure it's easy".
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:29:20
Yes. I'm excited. Thank you for asking.
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:37:50
It's best to have your private keys with you, in case anything happens. I recommend you to not send or receive until new workflows emerge to protect you from playback attacks.
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:34:09
I have to say, the fees are quite high in my opinion. About 10-15%. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:08:59
No. They keep the private keys without giving you access. You should get a [paper wallet]( for now. Trezors and other hardware wallets may take too long to arrive. When a hard fork does happen, don't transact until workflows emerge to protect you from playback attacks, just to keep your coins safe. If you own the private keys, you should have the same amount of coins on both chains as well.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:24:59
Yes. Would you like a drink too?
@_date: 2017-07-06 10:19:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:29:52
Hashed potato, my favourite snack. Delicious.
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:44:38
Just wait for a couple more days.
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:08:08
I don't exactly know what you mean, but I'm assuming you want to buy BTC from Coinbase and move them to another wallet? If so, Coinbase may take 16-24 hours if you want to buy BTC. Just so you know, if you have the private keys and a fork is coming, you will have the same amount of coins on both chains. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:23:39
I recommend you to check out the Bitcoin Wiki here: 
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:31:31
You never know how much Bitcoin is going to be worth in the future as fiat slowly loses its value.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:29:09
No one really knows, but I'm keeping an eye on Antshares and Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:18:18
That is 100% a scam considering there's a space between "wallet" and the period.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:30:32
I think there is always a middleman in credit card services. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:07:51
Definitely not, considering it's volatile and risky. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:34:31
I suggest you update to the latest Core version and let it synchronise for now.
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:22:00
Yes. And I'd say it has a chance of tanking shortly after. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:07:11
Move them to a wallet where you can access the private keys. If there were a fork, and you control the private keys, you'll own the same amount of coins on both chains. Take note that Coinbase does NOT allow you to access the private keys. If you don't have the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:59:15
You should transfer your Bitcoins to a wallet where you hold your private keys. If you have access to your private keys, and a split is coming, you will own the same amount of coins on both chains. Take note that Coinbase does NOT allow you to access the private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:51:53
I only know about Trezor 2. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:55:42
Just found out they have their own website: 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:15:16
Now that's positive energy right there. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:34:17
I suggest you store your Bitcoins in a paper wallet since you can access your private key. If you have the private key, and a fork is coming, you will hold the same amount of coins on both chains. When a fork does happen, don't send or receive until new workflows emerge to protect you from playback attacks.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:23:48
By far the best shitpost I've ever seen on well done. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:17:06
If you have the private keys, you will have the same amount of coins on both BTC and BCH chains. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 10:58:46
It's hard to predict the future value of Bitcoin. You should do your own research.
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:46:59
Definitely possible.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:51:00
I say it's a scam.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:27:44
It's definitely possible, but not profitable. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:22:36
I don't know what that is, and I don't want to know what it is.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:15:23
People are panic selling over August 1.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:15:10
I'd do whatever I want and not worry about my boss yelling at me for no reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:15:11
Let's see what's going to happen to the price. Hopefully we can see a dramatic increase.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:27:55
I don't think there's anything wrong with accepting BTC today. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:12:47
Can confirm it was down. It's up now, at least for me. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:01:03
There is basically a software programmed in the USB specifically to solve SHA-256 problems.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:29:27
I heard that he got fired today. This guy is such a hero. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:51:20
I'd say it's still alright to buy Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:00:46
Yes, people can now send you BTC using that address you have right there. I suggest you use a wallet where you can access your private keys.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:22:53
Now to wait for Amazon to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:31:15
If you just want to hold, you can leave them on your paper wallet since you already have the private key. However I do not recommend keeping coins on exchanges and using them as wallets. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 12:57:05
I suggest you use a wallet where you control your private keys. Coinbase does not allow you to access your private keys, which is why I don't really trust them. If you have the private keys, you have full control of your Bitcoins. And if a split really were to happen, and you have the private keys, you will own the same amount of coins on both chains.
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:12:10
I won't say €166k is "rich af", but congratulations. I can't even earn that much.
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:44:14
Yes. You should transfer your Bitcoins to a wallet where you control the private keys, as you don't have access to your private keys on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:11:48
Solutions and new technology I mean. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:07:43
I believe most transactions only require scanning QR codes, no need to copy down Bitcoin addresses and prices.
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:56:36
Nice, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:19:45
The recommended disk space is 145 GB. However with the Bitcoin network constantly growing in size, you'll eventually need more than that. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:22:43
I went there multiple times and I can confirm that it is a buy and sell ATM. When you sell, you send Bitcoins to the ATM and receive a ticket with a QR code. Wait for a while for the transaction to confirm. Once the transaction is confirmed, you go back to the machine and press "Redeem", scan the QR code and receive the cash. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:04:51
I won't use Coinbase if I were you. Coinbase doesn't even allow you to access the private keys. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:26:19
What do you mean by "time performance"? Do you mean the confirmation time?
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:27:38
Yes, there is a chance. But VERY unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:56:32
We'll see. This is going to be fun. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:34:06
If we're talking about exchanging altcoins then yes. To buy Bitcoins anonymously, it is possible through LocalBitcoins or Bitcoin ATMs. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:48:54
I heard that Jaxx is supporting both BTC and BCH chains, but the security isn't that great in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:28:18
There is a possibility of a hard fork. Let's just wait and see what's about to happen, this sure is going to be interesting. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:05:21
Nobody knows. It's difficult to predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:10:51
Very informative. This is a great video for Bitcoin newcomers.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:44:31
For now, I suggest you use a [paper wallet]( Trezors or other cold storage devices may take too long to arrive. If you have the private keys, and a fork is coming, you will have the same amount of coins on both chains. Don't transact until everything settles down.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:00:32
Yes. If you have the private keys, and there is a hard fork, you will own the same number of coins on both chains. Keep them on your paper wallet until new workflows emerge to protect you from playback attacks.
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:48:53
It's not really "suspicious", but rather interesting. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:53:25
It could be worth $50,000 or $5. You never know. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:51:05
I'd keep them for at least a week without sending or receiving, just to make sure everything settles down. If I have the private keys, I have the same amount of coins on both chains. So I'd keep them on cold storage for now. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:18:32
Try going to the Mong Kok Bitcoin ATM where you can sell your Bitcoins. The address is located on their website: 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:19:55
I don't think so. Probably a coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:07:05
I think if you own the private keys you'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:57:39
Do you have evidence that this isn't a scam? I won't give money to random people for no reason.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:56:21
CoinCap. However the graphs are sometimes inaccurate. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:27:05
Cool. Now for Pizza Hut to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:09:47
When activating SegWit, the block size will also be increased. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:33:50
If you reach the payment threshold, you will be paid on the next payout time.
@_date: 2017-07-06 09:23:50
Indeed. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:24:45
My eyes exploded first. Best font ever. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:37:30
If you hold the keys you should be fine. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:02:10
I think it will continue to drop for at least a couple of days. There's too much uncertainty and speculation about August 1, as well as people panic selling.
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:07:49
@_date: 2017-07-10 09:17:19
It was quick, but I'm not satisfied about the 10-15% fees. To me it's already quite high. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:21:03
I recommend you to transfer your Bitcoins to a wallet where you control the private keys. When a fork were to happen, and you own the private keys, you'll have the same amount of coins on both chains. Take note that Coinbase does NOT allow you to access the private keys. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 06:38:38
We'll see in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-07-10 08:24:50
Actually, after taking a photo of it I tried it out.
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:29:05
IRS is getting out of control. Screw them.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:13:42
$150k is too much in my opinion. I'm still hodling right now. This is the best rollercoaster ever. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:53:46
Hong Kong. The ATM is located in Tsuen Wan.
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:14:07
I think they'll give you access to one chain only. On Coinbase, you have no access to your private keys. Move your Bitcoins to a wallet where you hold your private keys. If you have the private keys, and a fork is coming, you'll own the same number of coins on both chains. I recommend you to get a paper wallet for now. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:52:10
Thank you kind sir. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:31:45
If your version is outdated, try updating to the latest stable version.
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:44:09
It already looks ridiculous right now. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:21:01
I use Bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:41:46
No. When you log back in, your wallet gets new blockchain data and your funds will be displayed eventually.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:04:28
Sit tight and hodl onto your seatbelts. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:33:10
A real legend right there. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:23:40
Yes, you should move your Bitcoins to a wallet where you control the private keys. If you have the private keys, and a split is coming, you'll own the same amount of coins on both chains. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:32:19
In a short term, both coins should drop. But overtime they'll rise back up. In the meantime, both chains get what they want. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:05:47
I'd just download the HTML file, cut my internet and generate a new address. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:02:11
Good luck doing that, meanwhile there are 5 cameras inside and 1 camera outside. I'm sure it's easy. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:33:26
I've been thinking about this, yes.
