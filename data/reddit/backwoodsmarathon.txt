What? 
He didn't say when he bought in. $500 could be 500 bitcoins for all you know. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:55:28
I bought last night at the low low price of 17,600. It hurts...
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:00:26
Oh I am! I also branched out to Etherium and LTC. I believe in the future of crypto. I'm not going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:54:51
~~Statistically speaking that's the worst thing to do. If it's like $250 or $1 million, would you go with the 1/26 chance from the start of the game, or the 50/50 at the end of the game?~~
~~I'd switch cases at the end every time.~~
I was wrong...but I'd still switch cases!

Future trading starts Sunday afternoon.

~~You eliminated them as the game went on by removing cases.~~
~~I swear I already explained this.~~
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:28:19
Well if you removed 51 other cards and only 3 were aces...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:48:17
Please update this post...lol

You know in a supply and demand economy like GDAX, once all the orders on the book are sold, you could put a bitcoin up for whatever price you want and if someone's willing to pay for it they'll buy it. Seeing someone capitalize on that like yesterday is in no way an anomaly. If I would have been paying attention and not in class, I would have listed everything I had at 20,000 just to see what happened. 
But, once that big order is filled, the price will stabilize once the supply of bitcoins increases again. Just like it did yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:02
Ah, I assumed you meant the crash of the market, not of the site. The spike up and down in price is normal for an order as big as that one was. It seems under any moderately heavy load GDAX goes down.

I never said it was $500 when he bought in. I specifically said it was $1 per bitcoin in my example. My point was that he never stated when he bought his bitcoin, so you have no idea how much he has. 
How can you call something impossible if you don't know all the pieces?

~~At the end, when it's down to one case left and yours, the host offers you the chance to switch cases. The case you picked at the beginning has a 1/26 chance of being a million dollars. If you know the million is still in play, would you want the 1/26 chance that you picked at the beginning, or the 50/50 for the remaining case?~~
~~I'd take the 50/50 all day and switch cases.~~
[Here's an example of the end of the game...](
~~He stuck with the 1/26 chance from the beginning of the game, and didn't use his chance at a 50/50.~~
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:42:23
What, didn't you like that article written by a fictitious anarchist?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:01:01
~~It has equal chance at the time. But, when you made the decision for the case at the beginning of the game it was a 1/26 chance of that case having a million dollars. You're not looking at the full game, you're focusing on the last decision.~~
~~When you pick your case at the beginning you have a 1/26 chance. When you start eliminating the cases the odds slowly change. The second case you choose is 1/25, third case is 1/24, fourth case is 1/23...etc. Until you reach the end of the game where it's 1 case left and a 50/50 chance. But you picked your case 45 mins ago when you had a 1/26 chance. The odds of your case having a million in it are a lot less likely than the other case having a million in it.~~

I know the feeling. I just bought in 2 weeks ago. [Should have bought when I explored mining...](
According to an article on CNN, bitcoin was about $675 at the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:56
And now it's back.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:51:43
It is a version of the Monty Hall problem. Just had Stats last semester and we spent some time on it, and this exact deal or no deal example.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:28:57
~~No, I'm saying that for the end decision the case you picked from the beginning has a 1/26 chance of being a million. Just because you've had the case all game doesn't change the fact that when you picked that case, it was 1/26. You're assuming the odds change for your case as the game goes on, and it doesn't. Your case will always have a 1/26 chance, even for the final decision.~~
~~If you've eliminated all other options and it's down to $100 or $1 million. I would never stick with my original pick of 1/26 cases. I would always switch cases.~~
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:40:06
And with this comment it finally clicked what was trying to say. 
The whole situation changes when it's you opening the cases and not the host. 
You're right...sad part is I aced stats last semester lol

I don't know how we could have spiked up 4k in a day without "major financial institutions" joining the market.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:51:58
Or it's that monkey poop coffee.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:26:37
I've been having issues with them for the last 12 hours or so. I think the heavy load is bogging them down a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:39:11
If it's 25k by xmas I'll eat my right ball.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:21:17
Most of the sites linked on this subreddit are garbage. For a community so entrenched in keeping your assets safe, you guys sure don't mind browsing to sketchy websites. I just hope most people are running adblockers and some kind of noscript extension.

Not OP but another question about Coinbase. I'm sitting on GDAX and bitcoin are going for 8205, but buying into a bitcoin on Coinbase it says "Buy at 8246" and then it add's in $5.76 worth of fees. So not only is my money going for an overpriced bitcoin, but they're going to charge me a fee on top of that? I don't get it... Why would you buy off Coinbase and not just transfer my money to GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:54:40
I made a coinbase account almost exactly 4 years ago after I looked into mining. I realized mining wasn't worth my time, and forgot about bitcoin. I bought my first bits just yesterday. I've been watching Bitcoin from the sidelines since I first heard about them being $20 a piece. It was only when I saw that wall street will start dealing with Bitcoin futures that I pulled the trigger.
People are still skeptical. It never hurts to make a free account on a random website and look into it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:52:22
Over 1k BTC was just bought and sold on GDAX in the last 15 minutes. Your post has spectacular timing lol
