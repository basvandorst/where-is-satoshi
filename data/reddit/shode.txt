Pension funds have substantial allocations to equities, PE, and VC. Crypto is too risky for them though, yes.

Ah, ok.

What does the number 250,000,000 mean? How much hashing power has increased?

Do you still think China will let mining continue?? Alot of rumors against that notion

Interesting. That seems like a much more serious move compared to China's previous actions earlier this year and in 2013.
Could enter a prolonged bear market if that actually happens.. Other countries could take inspiration from it. 
I do think China will also issue its own state owned digital currency soon, in a limited capacity.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the basic thesis is this, right?
Huobi/OKCoin are not being Shut Down. They are stopping Yuan/Crypto trading by 10/31.
The idea is there will be some sort of government owned tether that allows the government to track transaction flow, that will replace the Yuan.
Do you think most exchanges will re-open using tether? Will only 1-2 remain (Huobi, OKCoin)?
How do you know the Chinese government won't just create their own new state owned exchange?
