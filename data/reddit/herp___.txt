Totally with you. I'm in it for the long run. I only invested what I could afford and not worried. Just scared for the bros who put way too much cheddar into it. I weep for them.

Oh man... things are not looking good. Chinese BTC are plummeting. Stand your grounds boys. STAND. YOUR. GROUNDS.

A knife this strong usually cuts thru the hand and bounces back up about 3-4 feet higher than before. I'm not worried at all.

Exactly. We have to keep a long term focus on these most recent developments. The Chinese "government" has often tried to control currency amounts and they have always lost. We are strong.

LOL your mom's awesome. Tell her to hold until they reach $10 then throw her in a retirement home. Sell when they reach back up to $40,000 as the Based Winklegods have predicted. ????????? Profit.

Now is not the time to give up on BTC. Now is the time to profit from the blood in the streets. People are freaked out and fleeing but this is actually a good sign. Look at the Great Depression and the Great Recession. People fled the stock market and those who scooped in made fortunes. Don't take it from me, take it from Warren Buffet: "When there's blood on the street, I'm buying."

Hold your positions!!!! HOLD YOUR POSITIONS.

Either let it keep slicing through one hand till the wrist or sell your position after the first finger slicing. Just some practical medical/financial advice.

We'll be back up over $2,000 by January. Buy in now while you have the chance. Let's make some money!

I'm waiting for the sheeps to flee. Have been for a while. As an early adopter, I've had much success but these newbs only mess up my arbitrage cash flow derivative pricing models.

Ummmm... except Beanie Babies weren't a crypto Libertarian currency to preserve wealth and create freedom. Nice try though.
