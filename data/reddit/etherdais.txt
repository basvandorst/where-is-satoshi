Hey, Thanks for this!    I've been offering 3D printed NFC-powered coin simulacra for almost a year now and i'm sure my customers will find this useful.  I'll try to see that people get directed here for further info!
* Let me share a bit more of what I know:  The NFC tag type is important, as the amount of data which can be written and the tag-to-device compatibility is not well documented.  I use a samsung S3 to read and write to mifare 1k and NTAG203 tags without issue using the app listed by OP. 
* making a tag waterproof is just a matter of preventing the antenna from coming apart.  'waterproof' NFC tags are embedded in plastic to prevent aqueous disintegration, but no special difference exists beyond that to make it waterproof.

They're only live if they're posted on an exchange.  Coins that I got a year ago were 'live' then, but they're not now.  In any case they were not for sale on an exchange, so they didn't hit the price.  I would point out that I wasn't suggesting that he move ALL of his coins, just some of them.  Donations would be one of the few ways he can spend them without being linked to their use as in a physical purchase.
I think the assertion that old coins moving only "means bad things for the price" is fallacious as the assertion that something like microsoft's adoption would spike the price.   It would be a factor like any other  -  prices change like the weather - Chaotically.

Both have merits, it depends on the design.   IF you're looking for a complex planar shape, laser cutting is the way to go.  IF you need a more complex topology, 3D printing might be better.  
Much like any technology, 3D printing suffers from the law of the instrument, and suddenly everyone is trying to 3D print two by fours.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:47:21
At the risk of raising the ire of those who think that companies which hold are sinning against the larger economy, let me describe Cryptoprinting to you.  
Most of our BTC expendatures have been to supplies (PLA filament, NFC tags) and staff (website updates/maintenance, design work), though small amounts were given away to those willing to donate cash to the local makespace, or tipped online.   Some amounts of BTC were used to obtain LTC to confirm competence prior to accepting LTC for payment.  (I classify this as coin for coin's sake, something used to familiarize myself with the operation of relevant systems)
As there's no way to pay for shipping with BTC (that I'm aware of), shipping costs come out of pocket.   The entire operation is very much a small-scale labor of love - We can provide pretty good service because we haven't had a huge amount of attention along with the crushing number of orders that might entail.  
One sign that someone is probably holding rather than converting to Fiat is an avoidance of BitPay.   We set up to use them, but since we had no intention of converting to fiat they became a rumble strip on the highway of BTC and we ask that customers simply negotiate with us directly.  (If anyone has a good suggestion for an escrow system or bitmit replacement, do let me know)

1.  If you can read to an NFC device, you may very well write to it, but not all phones are compatible with all tags.    Tags may be written and re-written.  It may be possible to alter them to stop re-writing with general tags, but a method has not been shared generally.

I've been looking at NFC for the last 6 months, trying to think of a genuinely useful addition to the BTC space from it.     Every implementation i've dreamed up or heard of suffers from some serious drawbacks and doesn't give you any better functionality than what is achieved with QR codes.  
In a practical sense, what are you gaining from having both codes on one card?  I'd break the damn thing in half and hide the half with the private key.   Even then, not as simple as having a QR code of your address in hand.    
If you can think of a counterargument, please lay it on me.

The hole is part of the STL model - we could work on making a version without the hole for a custom order perhaps.  I don't do a lot of CAD myself, so it wouldn't be a quick fix, but it's definately possible.

If you're really investing you should be secure.  If you're putting in a few bucks just to try it out and buy something, use that opportunity to learn what's what.

Until it's replicated, sure.   Perhaps a larger point that you bring up is that the 'white market' trading of BTC is largely done for holding purposes rather than the purchase of goods.  
We started  in late feburary.  We've had somewhere on the order of 9 orders for 7 customers.  The sudden spike in price has lead to a lull in orders, even as our site gets more traffic than it did when early interest set in.  We've got a custom product which is particular to the BTC community, useful, and decreasing in cost rapidly over the last few weeks (in BTC of course).  At this point, if there's a service accepting $ that does what you want, there's a big barrier to entry.  I don't know what the stats are but BTC users are but it seems that more are either miners, speculators, enthusiast cryptoanarchists, or SR users.     This critique of the limited applicability of the BTC economy is hard to tackle, and part of why we started the service in the first place.  
The chaos of SR would be in frauds pretending to be trustworthy sellers on any new iteration of it.  
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:27:15
As someone trying to offer services/products for BTC, I can attest to this being a source of concern/distress.

You can do all of that, but for 0.3 BTC it might not be worth the effort.  Depending on the client you are using, you'll be having transaction fees (generally 0.0005 BTC) for every little split.  
If you have a smartphone (especially android though I believe there's an option for iphone) I suggest a client-side app wallet.  Bitcoinspinner and blockchain are both fine, and i'm sure others can be suggested.  This will let you send coins in a practical way and not be tied to your laptop or PC.   Unless you're visiting Defcon, it's pretty unlikely that someone will hack your phone to take your coins, but it should still not be considered safe for long term storage of large numbers of coins.  
I hope this helps.

Regarding Paragraph 3:  Bitpay acts as an intermediary but provides no protection for the seller.  When you pay someone using it, the seller will get that payment (after bitpay is done with it, and has taken whatever their cut is) with no regard to fulfilling their order.  
Bitpay allows you to keep some fraction in BTC, which sounds like the way to go for you.  I have no real problems with Bitpay beyond the fact that my business isn't 'real' enough to require using it and Bitcoin does what it's supposed to do without it.

I like your breakdown, and think we could include whether or not /how they would spend as opposed to sell.  What about (5) People holding coins who will spend if they find something they want?

On the note of the 'loop' you remarked on in the OP,
We are close to that at some level.  We've been selling 3D printed objects and are soon buying replacement filament using BTC as well as selling some BTC locally to support shipping costs.  In this way we've been trying to make a small loop which sustains itself, without much larger infrastructure beyond bitcoin and those we interact with.   Is this what you were thinking of?

You could still use them on SR.  
You could sell them locally to people for cash - that's the most direct way to "get cash out".  Otherwise you're in for some headaches. (and taxes probably)
You could buy stuff from any one of the sellers on the various websites popping up.  (bitmit might have something random you like)

I think you've hit many key points about why LTC has merit (not why it will 'take over' as some thing).  
At some level, it may provide a more useful means of exchange than BTC simply due to its liquidity.  Right now, that's because BTC is better held than spent in the minds of most, but if they're justified in this feeling BTC will never be used for daily transactions.  The value and need to wait for confirmations will delay transaction time, while the transaction fees will no longer be 'mere cents' but instead a serious chunk of change.   You can imagine LTC filling that niche with a bit less stress.  
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:13:49
Seriously - I've only earned (not mined) a few BTC so far, but i think it's important to break off a few 0.05 or 0.1 to friends who have never had ANYTHING before and just want something other than 0.0 to show up in their little bitspinner account.  what's a few bucks between friends?  
If that $5 of BTC turns into 10000 in the future - i'll only be happier for having given it to them without any bullshit.  They didn't have to go to CVS, they didn't have to get scammed to get any BTC.  They might not have enough to spend on much, but at least it's something.  Now they have something to talk about, and something to keep track of the change in BTC value over time.

This.    Think of it as a crypto-economy.  
In the future, I wouldn't be surprised if everyone on SR migrates to atlantis.  Why?  BTC will be too overvalued to be useful for their exchanges.  LTC will still be some fraction of BTC and its easy enough to convert between the two(with BTC-e now or Gox and others in the future), so people might be more likely to spend that instead.   These systems work together - the market cap of LTC doesn't damage that of BTC.  They're sister currencies.
In the long run, the power consumption angle might get more attention, in which case PPC may have more merit than most btc-e trolls will give it credit for.

-We Prefer PLA, and can do ABS.  PolyCarbonate is a future possibility, as is HDPE, however PVC is not available in the near term
- Batch orders will surely get a shipping discount, and may also get some rate discount (still looking at the numbers there).   We are still working on payment plans/methods but this will be factored in
- I'm not part of TechPaladin, but i'm responding to their offer to accept BTC (there's another startup offering to take BTC for filament as well) by trying to produce a service.  I don't mean to jack the thread so much as get the word out to anyone who has interest in general.  The short term plan is to provide quality orders to make satisfied customers.  In the long term we'd like to have a distributed network for organizing printers and local clients (especially if either party is already established as trustworthy through prior transactions.

@_date: 2013-11-30 15:56:47
It's totally not going to work at all.  Nobody will want to deal with it.  
I say this as someone who has been printing NFC tags into bitcoin shaped tokens for months:  NFC isn't what you want for this application.  It can be used, but it's awkward and not safe.   IF you want to store a private key on a tag for your own cold wallet, that's one thing.  Waving around an 'encrypted' nfc tag for payments to be made with seems like a technical nightmare.
BTC is smarter than this.

Please let me know if you find any documentation on this.  
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:46:07
[This](  is what I was referring to.  More of a static data storage method than a useful protocol between devices in this case, though NFC certainly is that.  
I'm pretty sure most of the people who ordered those tags did so for cold storage of keys.  
QR is static but it's easy to generate on the fly as you need, then scan as you need.  Bitpay makes good use of it.

@_date: 2013-07-09 20:07:16
I agree with you to a point:  If one did not expect to gain something, it's hard to justify 'buying in'.   At the same time, our current financial woes can be traced to unchecked greed for it's own sake.  It would be a real shame to see bitcoin undermined by the same sort of attitude.  
Aside:  
As someone with a bit of background in the area, I would say that the Higgs is touted as a big thing in science but of little practical application.   (Doesn't really clean up the Standard Model, and doesn't let you DO anymore than you could before 'finding' it)  Perhaps there is a better analogy somewhere in that.

my first kit was a lazercut techzone mendel - awful in lots of ways.  I used that to print out the next 3 printers (for myself) and the hoarde has helped bootstrap a number of other people who have come to me for parts. (I probably have at least 7 'children' printing for other people)    There are lots of different possible routes you can go depending on what you want to do and what you want to spend.  Many things systems are pretty comparable but there are a few places you should avoid.  
I've some experience with other consumer-grade AM systems (Fab makerbots etc), but RepRap is what I do the most.   
EDit:  on that note, fuck makerbot as they drop support for their products as soon as they design a new one.  Give me a company that picks a model and sticks with it for a while.  Lots of people are taking their trash cupcakes and donating them to schools.    The school teachers are initially happy, until they realize that they're never going to get it to run (or run well).  Their administrators say "we just got this thing donated, you don't need money for a RepRap", and then they're stuck with nothing.

Hola squidsandwich,
I've been running  for a while, and watching the situation generally.  I've not yet seen anyone offering to sell an entire printer for BTC, and actually i've been frustrated by the lack of response from other quickly started groups (i'll not name them here) who were supposed to be offering printing materials for BTC.  Not made any orders for filament yet because they don't reply to my emails.   
That being said, while there might not be such a service, I'd be happy to try to give you any advice I can.
(edit:  For the curious, we've fulfilled a number of orders already, including those made through reddit, bitmit and through inquiries at our website.  If you'd like me to direct you to customer testimonials I'd be happy to, i just happen to be posting this as i'm out the door to ship an order ;)
  
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:33:33
If you don't want to hold bitcoin, but simply want some exposure and attention - bitpay is great.  You'll get more orders, they'll give you the dollars and life will be grand.
If you are trying to offer your service for bitcoin and don't care about dollars and have no intention of converting them, don't waste your time - just use a wallet program/app and start accepting coins.  The entire joy of bitcoin is the freedom it entails and you'll not have any fees!  
We started using bitpay on our site because we thought it might provide some security (and comfort) for buyers, but that's not the case.  At least Bitmit was providing escrow.  It was disabled after it became a holdup in the processing of orders, as we had to wait for them to release the funds after taking their fee.  
tl,dr;  good for extant acceptors of fiat, bad for new proto-services who just want bitcoin for bitcoin's sake.  
@_date: 2013-03-15 14:22:50
What you refer to is mostly an issue of purchasing bitcoin through an online service.   I'm sure someone locally would sell you any small fraction you were willing to pay for.    In this sense i'm not sure how you are  distinguishing 'buy' from 'trade'.   
Standard unit of measure doesn't mean anything here: that decimal point slides just as easily in one direction as another.  The market value determines what the minimum practical value is.  
More problematic at the 'stage where everyone moves to mBTC' (which I don't dispute is probably going to be a thing) might be the 0.5-5mBTC transaction fee.  If you're thinking in mBTC then these fees become substantial.

Ah yes.  The first response I ever got on this subject was along the lines of "Will you print an ar-15 lower?".  Nope, but I can teach you how to!  
There's a lot of interesting arguments to be made about whether or not you could 3D print an 80% finished lower much as is offered now in metal.  Or a Cuomo clip that's unfinished.  If someone wants to donate enough to hire a fleet of lawyers first, we can see what the courts decide.
Until Defcad sets up a legal defense fund for such things, i'm not planning to get involved in that business.   Shapeways and Ponoko won't even print gun-shaped objects - so I'm told.  I don't blame them.

@_date: 2013-04-01 12:30:52
@_date: 2013-03-15 02:57:22
Yes, but:
On a practical level, expensive coins and limited access keep out new users.  Limited spending is going to make life hard for any service-based businesses which are hoping for a substantial part of their business traffic to be in BTC.  The value is only going to increase as the number of users increases.    
I'd say hoarding has merits, but so does charity.  I think that what shakethatbass did might have done more to help bitcoin than keeping the price high does.  Not only did he raise money for charity and raise awareness of bitcoin, there are now what, at least 20+ people who have 5BTC to use which they never had before.  If they all hoard it, then the economy sees no change.  If some of them try to spend it, or trade it with friends for cash - then they are helping the system to propagate.  
I think the point about hoarding should be "Don't JUST hoard. Make sure that some fraction of your hoard is going out and doing some good somewhere, ultimately increasing the value of your coins by making them more useful and accepted."

Thank you for your contribution(s)!
I feel at this point that some of the biggest challenges in bitcoin will be encountered after scaling, as block rewards are composed entirely of transaction fees.    The 'endgame', as it were.   I suspect that one can imagine a few scenarios where transaction fees provide the financial incentive for miners to continue mining but it might also be an opportunity for a competitor currency to supersede BTC by luring away its miners.    Does anyone worry about this much yet?  We will surely encounter the end of block rewards somewhat sooner than projected.

I had an account with them when they first started, with minimal issues.  Years later I make another account with Paypal, mostly to accept about $100 from someone for some printed parts.   Didn't use it for anything other than accepting that money and moving it to my bank account.  
Months later they randomly inform me that my account has had some features suspended.  Why?  I haven't used it in months!   They decided that I was no longer allowed to add money to my paypal account from my bank account, unless I sent them everything.  Photo ID, SSN card photocopy, recent passports - I think they even wanted me to prove residency with a bill for some reason.  I was waiting for them to ask for DNA.  What the hell happened?  The account was static but to them it might as well have been used to launder profits from international sex trafficking. 
I ignored this, as I had no intention of letting them handle any more of my money anyway.  Two months after that, they happily inform me that the restrictions on my account have been lifted!  Joy!  
It turns out that they haven't really been lifted (or perhaps their website was just bugging out at the time), but the option to deposit is still unavailable - even though they now say there are no problems.  My only solace is that I had no intention of really trying to use their shit anymore.
If paypal was a person I'd kick them square in the crotch.

This is an important point.  
On a related note:  I saw a drop off in orders as the value of BTC started really spiking, and a number of orders yesterday after the price had dropped again.  I don't use bitpay, and so i've had to roll with the punches, but it seems like some folks are willing to spend again.  
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:17:23
You're right, and I haven't had a big problem with BTC because of it.
Not that gas is a good example of future stability, but the transaction is useful:  I can drive up to the pump, swipe my card, and have both sides be happy in a matter of moments.  If we want to see a cryptocurrency driven world you'd need to have that kind of response time.  That's where I see a niche that BTC can't fill (which doesn't devalue what it is at all, most people seem to miss this)
@_date: 2013-12-22 13:54:18
Haha.  These efforts are both about 6 months behind.   Hopefully in another 2-3 they will admit that it's not as useful of an idea as they first thought.

I tried to split the difference in March when printing NFC tags into bitcoin shaped tokens.  NFC is great for a "DIY Cascasius coin".  It appears lowsy for payment methods.

@_date: 2013-11-29 18:28:34
I guess that depends on the scale of adoption, and their intention.  
There are surely some recent investors who are looking at the long term, and genuinely inspired - new converts, in a sense.  I expect that they will be inclined to hold onto their coins even if there is a crash to 600, expecting that it will continue to rise with adoption.  
Those investing for short term gains are likely to want to avoid capital gains tax, preferring to spend their coins directly or otherwise avoid using their bank account if possible.  As time progresses, the number of ways to do this seem to increase.  
It might be pretty handy to have some mbtc to take overseas on travel so that you're not hassled or robbed by the TSA for traveling with funds in hand or screwed in the fiat-&gt;fiat conversion.
Even if current prices are driven by speculation, the adoption process is ongoing and the two continue to influence one another.  Bitcoins are becoming more scarce but the number of markets for them keeps increasing- I suspect that only Satoshi could tank the markets at this point, and it would require dumping a lot of coins on some large markets.   
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:25:34
I suspect it's more about the media coverage than the 'taint' of SR.  The 10 replacement sites all use bitcoin too, so it's not any less 'drug money' than it ever was (or than cash is as many point out).  
That, and Chinese adoption are both big factors.

I've been thinking about this for a while, though i've not got a definitive answer yet.
 If you want an "effective network capitalization", I'd try something like  (24 hour price/coin average) x (total # of coins transmitted over the network in 24 hours)/ (total # of coins traded over all exchanges over 24 hours)
It's probably also worth trying to factor in market depth at some point....

Some of what you're addressing here is part of what motivates litecoin - they want to have something suitable for quick transactions and small amounts.   It may be that we need an ecosystem of cryptocurrencies rather than a single monolithic one.

@_date: 2013-03-09 20:14:05
Seriously this, or give it to your friends who have heard about it for cash.  Spreading BTC among your friends, family and peers is the best way to get rid of it.  It's worth enough now that they won't feel scammed by the idea of it.  
@_date: 2013-12-22 13:51:48
I feel like we've not achieved enough adoption to really receive those benefits, particularly the second.  The active monitoring of NFC requires that it is turned on and i'm not sure that active scanning is desirable - you only want to scan when you want to spend, otherwise NFC is an attack route for data on the device.

 started with only direct BTC payments, though we've now expanded to bitpay.  
There's more of an opportunity to be scammed or otherwise have a dissatisfied customer if you're doing a direct transaction perhaps.  We'd had a policy of printing your order, sending photos, requesting 1/2 payment, and expecting the second 1/2 of payment upon arrival.  That's worked pretty well for the few projects we've had.  Most people want the NFC coins in particular, but if we're doing a custom job for someone we like to maintain communication about the status regularly.
There are a number of providers of 3D printer filament willing to accept btc.  We are planning to make an order for more filament using the BTC earned from sales within the next few weeks.

Currently, there are more phones with cameras than with NFC capability.  If you need to send bitcoins in the dark, screens light up to display QR codes, or you can use any other method to send the address data.
In the long term, assuming widespread NFC capability, there may be some utility, but you just need an NFC sticker.   Having a card is nice if you want to have style I suppose, but there's no need to have your private key laying out like that, even if it is encrypted.
IMO, NFC is currently best for hiding small amounts of data in inconspicuous places, like cold storage.  As a technology of exchange it seems weak as hell.    I say this as someone who was looking for every excuse to market NFC for his own product - so please don't think i'm just hating.

a) those already exist
b) they are generally far more hackable, and exist as a good target for malicious attacks.  
A simple app wallet is the thing you're talking about, and you can either make a better one, or make an app to cater to the larger crypto community, or you can make something that most will forgo in lieu of other options already available.     
*you asked for the top 3 functions, and one of them would be the ability to function without exposing your private key.  Make an online part to take the transactions and an offline part to generate them, as armory does.

For those who are focused on investment:  I feel like it's going to be worth a lot more to everyone if you send a few dollars of BTC to your friends and family just to get them engaged.  Android apps make this easy, and they'll watch the value of bitcoin just to see how things move.  This spreads awareness.  
I feel like if bitcoin is going to make the world better, one way to make that start happening is to be generous with what bitcoins you have - even if it's not much.

Manfred Macx, of Stross' book *Accelerando*, was the inspiration for my own foray into bitcoin.  Venture Altruism might be a bit beyond my current capability, but offering 3D printing services and 3D printed NFC-enabled bitcoin simulacra isn't.  I didn't quit my day job to start doing it in Feburary, but providing a service to the cryptocurrency community (no fiat accepted) seemed like a good part time gig.  I'm happy to say that we've had quite a few customers, including a number of custom print jobs.  
I always knew that others would accept bitcoin for 3d printing services and expected my own orders to wane in response.  As this continues to happen, I consider it a success for Bitcoin (capital B) even as I might see less bitcoin personally.  
I have ordered the filament and the nfc tags which are used to make the simulacra WITH bitcoin.  There are enough people offering 3D printer kits for bitcoin that you could buy one with bitcoin, supply feedstock with bitcoin, and provide prototyping services with bitcoin.  Closer to a closed circle than most efforts, no?
I think others have shown that Stross' points are weak, but what is most disappointing to me is the lack of vision.  My last 12 months watching and participating in Bitcoin has felt like a personal accelerando experience and it's surprised me that the man who might be said to have some responsibility for that seems to be fighting the very techno-evolution he loves to write about.

Honestly, not to poo poo your idea, but I think it's a waste of effort.  
You're welcome to push this project as you seem motivated, but I think a physical wallet device is pretty overrated.  You're hoping to add extra security but what you're talking about is something complex enough the 'vast majority of people' you seem concerned about as late adopters wouldn't want to bother with either.  They're still going to want a paper backup of any private key associated with a hardware device.

Physical representations of bitcoin have their place, however most transactions will likely use the smartphones which are becoming more and more prevalent.  
Physical bitcoins really represent a form of cold storage which might be used as a means of transfer.  Aside from Casascius coins, i'm not sure that 'pre loaded' coins are ever going to pick up steam, but the 'empty' paper wallets and bills might have a use.  
Another consideration:  [nfc tags for storage](
@_date: 2013-08-30 13:28:25
As you and others point out, a blacklist is probably not the way to go.  
What I could see happening is a BTC bounty setup for information leading to identification of holders of certain private keys (IE ones leading to stolen coins).  
There's no reason they can't spend them, or that others can't accept them, it just creates some incentive for others to pay to know who has them.  This is most likely to occur if they ever try to spend them with any merchant, or other participant, which turns out to be an important part of the spending money game.  
I'm surprised that more stolen coins haven't already been sent to mixers.

I just used bitinstant the other day and it wasn't too hard.  
If you ever go overseas, you might have some value you can spend without converting.  
If you want something from SR, you're going to need something other than cash.  
If you want to fund a cause which the banks don't support (wikileaks for example), you'll need something other than dollars to get to them.  
I don't know that the general public needs it per-se.  Then again, if something bad enough happened to the dollar it might seem appealing.   Honestly, I think btc would be in bit trouble if drugs were legalized.

Lessig has often spoken about 'striking the root', and attempting to get congress to become functional and in service of the people again.  
In some sense, bitcoin strikes the true root: money.  One could argue that until central banking is undermined it will be difficult to out-bribe the rich.  
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:16:36
I'm not sure that anyone's pointed it out lately, but many of the speculators are in the same asshole mentality that 'the rich' (perhaps better phrased as banks and financial institutions) use to screw everyone else over.  
The dark side of BTC is that 'speculative lottery' angle, which will never go away but seems to consume some people who might be better off trying to make a new game to play instead of that old one.  
So, thanks for not being one of them, I guess.

There's a lot of disparaging of litecoin among many in the bitcoin community, and I wonder if they do this because they see it as a threat to their investment, rather than an ally and likely resource for them as well.  
I'm not sure how Pete Surda misses the average block completion time, but this seems to be one of the critical factors preventing implimentation of day-to-day transactions with BTC.  Even if you're trading BTC to someone in person you generally hang out with them for at least 30 minuts while you're both waiting for that transaction to get mined into a block.    Litecoin is a deliberate attempt to address this, but it seems to get swept under the rug in most of these 'analyses'.

@_date: 2013-04-14 05:42:03
I'm glad to see that RI has responded here, but i'd like to take the time to elaborate on some things i've been considering on this issue.
-Reliability:  Even with a sound design and a good source, there's a learning curve for getting a 3D printer to do what you want.  You might put a working printer into the shipping container, but it's hard to know what state it will be removed in.   While any problem with most RepRap can be solved quickly by a skilled user, for a newbie it may be daunting to figure out why your prints are sucking.
-Model:   There are a variety of designs of printer available, whether RepRap or one of the derivative designs.  The Prusa mendel is a popular choice, but it has its own issues in the long term (you'd better have your y-axis motor voltage set correctly for example).  The Mendel Max is nice, but the frame ends up being a bit more than it needs to be for most prints.  Ultimately the overall design is perhaps less important than the nozzle size and electronics in place in terms of final quality, but everyone sees the printer model rather than these functional features as a limiting factor.
-The Market is harsh:  A number of early 'mom and pop' 3D printer manufacturers folded early on, as it's hard to meet the demand once you start offering to make an entire printer system.  Either the high learning curve, or in some cases the poor quality of the product, makes frustrations in your clientele rampant early and often.  Even with your best effort, people are going to be pissed that they forked out ~$1K for something which doesn't work out of the box
Investment - If you weren't already offering 3D printers for sale, planning to do so requires a substantial investment in materials, as there isn't really much room for profit given the market (which is filled with amateurs and scams as well as genuine companies) often bottoming out at ~500-600 at the bottom.  Electronics and hot tip (again, the most important parts in some ways) will surely cost ~250-350 depending on what you go with.  Making parts yourself saves money, but then you're prone to providing crap like the metal tips techzone(don't ask) was offering which broke 75% of the time. 
Sorry for not getting back on this.  There are a lot of details to offering to deliver assembled printers.  In many ways, you are best suited to use your printer if you had the opportunity to participate in its construction, but I understand that not everyone has the time and energy to do so without guidance.  
If anyone has problems or questions Re: 3D printing, do hit me up. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 13:30:39
So, there is a market in printing for others, but it's not huge and there's more and more competition all the time (If i show you how to build and run your own printer, why do you need me again?)  Add onto that large operations like shapeways and ponoko and there's not much left.   Earlier reprappers printed out kits of parts which drove the parts price down (on ebay and elsewhere).  
If you're under the illusion that it will pay for it self with all of the things you print out:  Well, i'd just hold off on that one.  It may very well pay for itself in utility and fun over time but it's going to be tricky even to find people who want printed objects.   If you do find them, they're going to expect that your quality is up to par with industrial systems (which it might be if you're really good at tuning your system) which is hard to do with a machine that lost orders of magnitude less.
I'm not sure what you mean by 'mid level system'.  
I'd say that 3D printing with RepRaps is much like bitcoin:  Don't invest anymore than you're willing to lose, and don't think of it as a get rich quick scheme.

Right, but no matter how i search all i find is stuff from boston.  As much as I like panera, i'll probably not order from the boston one since i'm in the middle of PA.  
The listings are either concentrated to limited areas or else the site is broken.  In any case, there's jack for me to order at the moment.  Will keep an eye out to see if that changes.

We thought about this, but it's hard to print scannable QR codes without a dual-color extruder.  
I'm a bit lost on the bulk order thing?  We can do a larger order if needed, though they're not mass produced.  Is that what you mean?

You guys still doing this?  No reply on the email I sent you.

If you didn't have your own logos all over it, along with that bit at the end it would be less forced
I like it, it's just a bit heavy on that end.  Also, showing that you're about bitcoin before the introduction of "plan B" takes the punch out of it.

I was pleasantly surprised when he said bitcoin.... at first I thought it was just a vid-edit.

You clearly think about this for a living - glad to have you here.  
What's the main takeaway point here?  Is this theoretical action by the Fed to kill BTC, or by goldman to cash in, or both?

AS much as I love a good accusation, I don't think this is supported by the evidence.  Paypal's just fucking awful in and of themselves.

Fair enough.  I know of a 3D printing service for bitcoin, but other than that i'm not aware of too many others... have you scouted for some to put up there?

No need for rivalry cryptochaps, BTC and LTC can coexist!

This is my concern.  A QR code only needs a camera (now basically a device standard), while NFC is limited to devices which are capable of interfacing with it.  One funny thing about NFC tags: not all tags are compatible with all devices.  =(

Any interest in starting a 'bitcoin merchant meta subreddit' of some sort?  I think that would be a useful place, and a safe harbor when the next wave of interest hits.

I think this is why LTC is worth giving some consideration, even for diehard BTC holders who feel threatened by it.  
Even if LTC doesn't provide any technical benefits beyond BTC (as many will argue) being willing to trade it with others (rather than only holding) might give it more liquidity than BTC the way things are going, though the value of the two is related.  For those really spending bitcoin (SR users), LTC now offers a similar option with perhaps a lower barrier to use (as more people are willing to let go of LTC).   
I realize it's not a popular thing to say much other than "LTC = scamcoin", but the larger utility which you note seems to be maintained without the expectation for speculative returns that BTC has.

Aren't you worried about sending the STL to shapeways?  They have all of your private keys now, and you don't need to break the STL open to view inside.

I feel his hashtag.  Try explaining bitcoin, 3d printing and near-field communications at the same time.   *sigh*
