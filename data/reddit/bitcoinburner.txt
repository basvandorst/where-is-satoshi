Hi sgornick, I may have misphrased my question.  Could you check this out?

Your idea is very good, but incomplete; you don't consider the effect of a malevolent party on the system of reputation itself. Eve, a competing merchant to Alice, could make multiple purchases from Alice in a short amount of time and report them all to taint them. This relatively small investment would destroy Alice's capital, ensuring she would not be able to pay bills or employees. 
This is unfortunate because I really liked your idea. Can you think of a way to prevent this attack?

Ah, I think my question misled you; I apologize.
What I meant to ask is why doesn't a pool levy fees for including transactions in the block chain that it processes?
For example, Deepbit looks like it's about 15% of the total bitcoin processing power.  Let's say it's about 1/6th for simplicity.  So every block has a 1 in 6 chance of being produced by Deepbit.  Once Deepbit produces it, everyone else stops mining that block, verifies it (and the transactions it contains) and starts on the next one.
Now, say Deepbit tells its users only to include transactions in the chain that pay a 1 BTC fee.  This means that, on average, every transaction that doesn't pay this fee will be delayed from entering the block chain by 10 minutes with 1/6th probability, 20 minutes with 1/36th probability, or 30 minutes with 1/216th probability (etc.).  That doesn't sound like a lot, but given 52560 blocks per year, the chance that Deepbit generates every block for an hour is (52560-6)*(6)^(-6)... which is 1%.  I guess it's not that bad, unless someone with more share starts doing it.  Still, not getting even a single confirmation of your transaction for an hour could cripple checkout at some merchants.
