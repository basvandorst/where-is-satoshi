I used to get very stressed when I first got into crypto currency. I developed brass balls. I hodl now. Because if you hodl you won't be upset. I recommend you buy and stop looking at prices. That's the issue. Constantly looking at prices is a bitch. Unless you can develop brass balls. 
Tl;dr - develop brass balls by hodling and not pulling out

Lol. Drink some wine and breathe dude. No one wants to help a key board warrior who's poor and angry attitude is clearly shown through his texts.

Great assessment

You know how banks run out of money and just print more on paper with no real value behind it, just what they say? 
That’s what we’re trying to avoid here.

I’m sorry to say but it’s people like this that make other people more money.

You private key is where the BTC is stored, on the blockchain, no where physical. As long as you have your private key, you’re good my friend.

Nope. Invest now. Start with Coinbase. If not, use Gdax for lower fees.
