In Red Deer where this is located, that's considered a cheap acreage still.  Anything under 700k sells fairly quickly. Besides, that is just option number 1- option number 2 brings in much more $$.
But that is why we went for Bitcoin as a selling feature, it won't be a typical buyer that we are looking for. A developer or someone who sees the potential and wants to buy and hold is our target market because there is a lot of profit left on the table for the next fellow :)

What if I back it with insurance? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:01:27
Well we shall have to find someone who wants a lot of volume because because of this Listing, things have blown up for the Real Estate to Bitcoin market. We ended up starting a website where you can buy investment properties for BTC- Check it out. 
It will be fully up and running soon :)

3.33 acres of development land located right behind Costco and highway frontage ;) 
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:56:32
Why thank you :)
I shall make sure to inform everyone once I have a bit more information on the process. Heh we had an offer of Vietnamese dong but it was off by several hundred thousand dollars :p 
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:12:58
Convert it? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:05:23
The property is currently structured to have 7 lots on it, one of which is the house itself which would sell for easily 650 alone leaving you with 6 lots but where I see the true value would be turning it into commercial when Jim Bower starts developing the back end right away here and then you are sitting on a gold mine :).

I would invest.

&lt;Realtor for this property, aka Bryce Kander&gt;
The seller does have a mortgage on this property but its not an overly large amount, the lawyer seems fine with everything as it shouldn't take long to liquidate the amount needed to pay it off so we are hoping for a "grace period" or something, I'm not 100% sure what his intentions are when it comes to it.  
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:59:40
That's where I currently buy through 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:42:37
The rent covers a portion of your mortgage while you sit on it and wait for its true potential of development. It's located a stones throw away from Red Deer and right on our main highway. Could be zoned for commercial use and in that case then you are laughing :).  We have two appraisals on file, one for 1.4 and one for 1.5, client is just motivated to sell because she has other plans with her money.

Haha I know right!  I had the numbers wrong last time haha, if you refinanced and took your 280k out right away you could buy more bitcoins with it and still be having 1000 cashflow from that triplex.  Haha hard to explain that in a title ;) 
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:58:57
Red Deer Alberta currently.  I've got everything from a 2.2m mansion to a triplex for sale for bitcoin. Plus I will combo the sales with property management for you, so all you see is numbers going into your bank account :).   Our site will be up hopefully by the 1st but that is the gist of it :) 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:09:13
I've got a house you can buy for 999 bitcoins?  
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:58:27
What is overstock? Sorry new to this addiction 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:44:46
This is why I don't warranty my work after midnight ;)
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:25:32
Ill have it up and running a full site hopefully by the 24th of Dec :) keep and eye out on the feed :) 
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:01:50
All good m'friend! :) 
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:29:02
I have properties that I would sell for BTCs, I contacted him haha. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:13:50
Well that's saddening, I put a space between bit and coin... Oh well I'm leaving it, its 2am and I need sleep :) 
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:18:54
Sorry I guess that's if you refinanced and took out all your money after you bought it. It rents for 2250 a month  so 1700 cash flow after paying utilities and taxes and insurance. I also have a property management company who would take it at 8.5% of the monthly rent.

If you are wanting a house, I have a 1.89 million one that is the biggest house in Red Deer, 7500 sq ft and looks like a castle- but this property here is for an investor, not really someone looking to settle down, someone will make an easy million off of this due to its location and development potential. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:15:49
Depends on the price at the time of the offer- if the offer is placed right now 389 bitcoins 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:44:43
I would start buying Real Estate with some of it.  I currently have several properties ranging from 149 Bitcoins to 2200 bitcoins. The 2200 one is a 7500sq ft mansion which is also the second biggest house in the town backing onto a lake, also have a few cash flowing investment properties ranging in the 300s and a townhouse with a tenant already in place for 149 that would cash flow about 850 a month

Also am curious as to the answer to this as I am selling Investment houses for BTC and think it would be an easy way for people with large amounts of coin to transfer it into a safe and long term investment such as Real Estate

First million dollar home for sale in Canada.

The owner is wanting to retire and has other investments she can place the money in to make more profit long term. 
Development is all "potential" pricing for the most part.

Thanks guys!

That sir is an impressive billboard 
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:34:07
I currently have 5 listings that can be purchased with Bitcoin.  Ranging from 2.2m to 150k.  Even have a triplex that cash flows 2100.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:16:26
If I was the buyer I would purchase and then refinance and take as much of my money as I could out of the property so I could keep purchasing more investments while I sit on this one and in 4 years turn around and either sell or develop this land and make a pretty penny.  If you went the residential rout you'd be able to get 8 lots, one of which would have the house on it and I would turn around and sell it for 699,000 then I have 7 other lots that would be around the 220-240 mark. Now I have sold for 2.2.  1.2m in 4 years is a pretty good return in my option
