"As is the case with Finney, it would be extremely strange to develop a crypto (B-Money) and then email yourself mentioning another party (Adam Back) looking to add a citation for another crypto you had been developing."

So no evidence except gut feeling?
[Here is an article ruling out different people for different reasons](

Hashes (calculations) per second in Exahashes and Terahashes. Exa and tera being the same as gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte, exabyte

It would be nice if you could provide strong evidence. Otherwise it's the same as the flatearther saying ReSeArCh ThIs oN YoUr oWn!!!
Yes, it is possible that he has the knowledge to create Bitcoin. He created(?) PoW and is mentioned in the Whitepaper if I remember correctly.
It is also plausible that Nick Szabo is Satoshi. That was a popular theory a few years back.
But it's nice that you didn't say Craig Wright.

If one of satoshis coins is moved people will panic
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:35:23
The owner of that adress is either dead or lost the private key a long time ago
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:35:35
That Satoshi mined the Genesis block or that he mined \~1000000 BTC?
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:29:22
The genesis block was mined by him and people calculated how many blocks he mined. Back then there were only a few miners, so it's not that difficult if you know what to look for
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:19:59
The owner is Satoshi and its closer to 1 million
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:38:23
Yeah no
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:51:04
[Some scientific research](
Saw a similar study a few years ago, so it's no new information.
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:36:28
Then tell me who is Satoshi?
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:52:28
Or just Twist a few, so the data is corrupted.
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:11:06
The wallet is really bad but there will be a new version soon. Sending is really confusing because there are no fees. Maybe you get a confirmation after a few seconds, maybe an hour, maybe you have to reattach (refuckingsend). But i like the concept. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:43:50
With the price hike came the people who only want to become rich and share memes. The meaningful discussion moved to other places...
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:03:27
On reddit there is No price, no memes. A nice place, but only 4k subscribers
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:45:28

At least you know that the bill has a nonzero value. If this is a scam you end up with a plastic card without any btc on it.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:11:29
I guess we will See more "bubbles" like before until it's saturated 
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:15:18
It was so silent for a few weeks...
I think this sub would be a lot nicer with less memes and no bch, ver, etc bashing

When I tranafer btc from my Bitcoin.de wallet to my actual wallet it takes them at least an hour to even start the transaction. After that the usual 30 minutes of confirmation. These exchanges are big and slow 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:45:42
Sadly I used all of them because I bought on the ATH.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:54:56
No wonder, I just bought.

As an EE I can confirm. This is also why the inside of your computer is full of dust.

What's the word?
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:04:31
Don't put anything into it that you cannot afford to lose. Otherwise you can win 1000% or lose 100%.
I have my savings I need for a jobless phase in one year and additionaly a fraction of that in btc, but I will keep the savings in fiat because if I lose the money im screwed big time.

Well if you buy more you gain more. Just bought 0.1 btc to dropp off near the peak of the bubble that may or may not come because I don't have more money to spare atm.
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:06:36
Tried that. Did not work. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:40:14
Not concerned that the price already dropped 10% from when I bought :D 
A teacher of mine always said you could win 100% or 1000% off your investions but if you lose 100% you lost it all.

I visited two shops listed there but they stopped accepting. One cashier didn't even know what Bitcoin is.

My father and I always have totally different ideas why the price did rise or fall. I say it was China, segwit, bcash,... My father says this one guy said something, the big banks did a thing, stocks are doing stuff,... 
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:37:44
Well even if it's not as bad as elsewhere it is still bad.

What about [Bitcoin Treff]( I thought this was like the German localbitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-10 06:48:08
Please remove more memes.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:00:07
I never understood the following, maybe you could be so kind to clarify?
Channels with balance at the start: Alice 0 --- 50 Bob 0 --- 50 Charly
Charly sends 50 to Alice, so the balances are: Alice 50 --- 0 Bob 50 --- 0 Charly
Charly closes his channel with Bob. So it's now Alice 50 --- 0 Bob, but Bob now has 50 in his normal wallet. So Bob now cannot send Alice anything despite commiting funds to the channel at the beginning. Is this correct?
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:45:10
The cashier at the first one didn't even know what Bitcoin was, they had ditched it ~2015. Was a small overpriced hipster food store.
I don't know about the second one, a nice italian restaurant. They have stickers on the door like "accepting American Express" and the like but no "accepting Bitcoin". Have yet to eat there...
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:29:30
Can we just ban memes and stuff like this? I have to get my technical info on other websites and I don't like closing reddit.

Wow. I was joking with the 3.5 H/s but seems SHA256 is that much more complicated than Ethash... Got 12 MH/s with my GPU mining Ether.
But no way they are paying that much for some GPUs :O

Why is it bad that they know how much btc I have? It's not even on my phone
