Does this qualify as blood in the streets? Cause I'm drinking my fill of sats today!

5k to me would feel like the elevator scene from The Shining!
I only just started buying beginning of last month and I've got a "stack sats" perspective/approach. I bought on the way up and I'm buying on the way down.
5k would give me an outside shot at owning a whole coin. I don't want to root against Bitcoin obviously, but I'd love that opportunity.
Either way it goes, I'm gonna keep DCA with my pre-calculated spare FIAT.

As the early 21st century composer B. Spears once opined in a tune that ranks among her greatest musical feats: "Gimme. Gimme more. Gimme more. Gimme. Gimme more."
She was obviously referencing sats in a dip. A prophet in our time.

There are things more valuable than money. Good luck to you and your pupper!

A small nick from shaving with an old razor blade.
Still, I shall suck on it like it were a wound from a venomous snake. My appetite for bloody sats knows no limits, high or low.
DCA and HODL.

Logged in to upvote and say thank  you for posting this! I've been lurking this sub for some time and it's usually the same several tips over and over (with good reason). But this is the first time I saw this recommendation. I really like it and will be using it as soon as my hardware wallet arrives.

I first bought at the beginning of this month. I've been lurking here for a little longer than that. I'm thrilled to finally be here with you all this time around.
Todays dip was so much fun I made this name so we can panic and cackle madly together.
Also so we can cry together since I'm not telling anyone, friends or family, that I'm in on this madness.

MY HANDS! OH, MY HANDS!
The left, Vibranium. The right, Adamantium. Mythical, indestructible materials.
They will not break. They will go beyond mere hodling. They will bathe in this blood!
