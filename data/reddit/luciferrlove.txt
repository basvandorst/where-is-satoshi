oh so about as competitive of the thousands of other alt- and shit-coins have ever been.

random metals fact: the cap of the Washington monument is made out of a pyramid of solid aluminum as when it was being built aluminum was so rare that it was considered a precious metal (actually was more expensive then gold at the time iirc)

i have heard that over 100 times about every random upcoming shitcoin, and it has yet to be a prophetic statement. who knows though maybe 101th times the charm /s

So exactly like JPM coin? This coin isn't even original in any possible way. And you are shameless by the way, there was a time when shills at least tried a little not to sound like full blown advertisements, I hope whoever hired you doesn't see the train-wreck of this entire post.

also one of the entire points of crypto to put your wealth out of the reach of banks and government, why would anyone in their right mid just turn around and put it in the hands of corporations instead. like that actually seems like it would be a step backwards from our current banking system rather then a step forwards. and that isn't even begging to open the lid on the clogged toilet of which corporation you are referring to. (rhymes with "base cook" and produces addicts at a way higher rate then even a crack dealer could dream of)

yay! credits cards and data harvesting corporations are going to work together to bring us the new age of currency! where do i sign up? /s.

Just gonna come call you out here, but umm shifting goalposts much? you said no large corporation backed coin existed and I pointed one  out to you, your next comment just shifts your augment from "corperation backed", to "its all about how deep their pockets are". Like ok, but even if we ignore your clear tolling bullshit attempts at derailing or endlessly stalling progression of discussion on the awful piece of shit this coin you are shilling is. That isnt even a point in their favor to have "deeper pockets" all that means they will have that much higher of an incentive to  preserve the status quo of inflationary fiat and wealth and class divide.

proably why its so high on the wall makes it a bit harder to do that

You are arguing with a guy who apparently thinks zero diversification is legitimately an acceptable investment strategy, he is wither trolling, 12, or so stupid, that if has made it to this point thinking that, there is nothing you say could which might convince him otherwise. Realize the lost-causes and just save yourself the headache of replying

oh im not saying tis not a competer, im simply saying it is only as much of a competitor as any of the other hundreds (thousands now?) of bitcoin alternatives.
