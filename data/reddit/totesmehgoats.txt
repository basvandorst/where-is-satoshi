Pretty neat to see it done actually. Has this service gained any traction since?

I figure Bitcoin already has plenty of these :)

Thanks. So as I understand, a web service that provides 99% of the functionality via SMS only. Sending money via SMS only, verification, etc. This would require both users to have accounts set up on a web platform (that would have to be verified based on phone, etc). Guess the technicality of the nature of the concept would require the web platform to sent and receive sms messages as well, and act as an intermediate body. The users (even in poor countries) would have to eventually access their wallet online using an internet connection to manage their bitcoins (public library, etc). The service would essentially act as a secure wallet, with transactions being managed and verified via sms.
Would look something like this:
* Send sms to service (The service would have a phone number) requesting to send money to a specified phone number with amount of Bitcoin to send specified.
* Service would respond via SMS acknowledging that transfer was made (and provide verification code), or that the phone number is not registered with the corresponding service.

To make Bitcoin more reputable, in terms of added services

As someone who is interested in providing a gateway, how successful are the gateways in terms of traffic?

Can you expand on this? I assume you mean a more elaborate way of doing this, with adding verification/escrow on top of existing wallets?


Another escrow service? Maybe one that actually gets a good reputation

I guess the other concern I have is the verification process with a lot of these exchanges (like Bitstamp). I am not doing anything shady, but I do not feel like forking out all of my documents to verify to them that I am me, and waiting many days.
Also, are they planning to eventually tax people that deal with anything BTC related? A lot has changed in the BTC world

So essentially a way to 'rent' hashing power, but instead of using hardware that is specific to the Bitcoin mining algorithm, you are trying to do the same for different niche market that uses another set of hardware? I would also imagine that home PCs would be off limits in terms of usability of renting power, so tailored to just farms?

I've actually set up an ad here. No one has contacted me yet.
Are all the 'easy' services so heavily overpriced over the bitcoin market price?
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:01:20
I figure providing more services that allow for the flow of Bitcoin to be used instead of hoarded would encourage new buyers :)

I am trying to understand the desire to lock a phone number to a bitcoin wallet...
Phones already have Bitcoin wallets, and can send a request for bitcoins via sms, providing address where to send money (where the sender can proceed with payment). Are you trying to reduce the step of requesting coins? So essentially somehow simply 'just send money to a phone'? Also, I imagine that the centralization nature of your idea (as I understand it so far) would bring in security concerns that go against the de-centralized nature of Bitcoin. And accessing the money with the phone would be another topic in itself. Not bashing any idea here, just really trying to fully understand the suggestions...

Search is useful. People are better, and generally friendlier! :)

Awesome! They are new to me! Thanks
I presume butterflylabs has ruined their reputation completely?
Edit: 70 dB and 200 volts! lol

If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting adding functionality on top of existing platform-dependent wallets to allow for an easy way to transfer btc using just sms?? Can't this be done simply already by sending an SMS with the wallet address? Just trying to gauge the details here.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:13:14
Thanks. Any suggestions for ASIC hardware? Will do some research :)

 Bitcoin Core.
Any reason why a backup would not work in the future, with a new wallet?
@_date: 2015-09-24 03:50:49
I ask because I want to load up the wallet again. Default Linux bitcoin wallet will do the trick as per usual?
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:29:40
Yes, Bitcoin Core is what I've used in the past.
I guess technically I don't have to do anything. Whenever I decide to read my wallet, just load the backup file and it should work with a new wallet.
Is there a possible case in the future if someone ignores bitcoin news that their wallet backup becomes useless?
My ignorance comes from rumors of having to decide on block-size and the other half gets left behind? I guess this would apply for any new transactions.
