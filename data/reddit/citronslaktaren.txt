Bitcoin becomes AI and eradicates humanity because humans are flawed. Amirite?
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:19:00
I have to disagree, I've seen alot of people getting into the wrong community and even people thinking they buy Bitcoin but really they buy Bitcoin Cash. We can't think that everyone will know these things, especially newbies. Just because two communities are infested don't mean another one should be.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:26:12
Wouldn't this be amazing? :D
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:07:11
Lmao this comment is underrated.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:36:53
Lol this was a dumb ass comment
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:08:28
What comment boiiii?
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:57:07
Alright that was super creepy. Exactly when I found this comment he literally started that exact part of the verse. Fuck my life. I'm gonna go sleep again.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:37:09
Wait. What?

Trying to spark peoples brains �� Have a nice one bro!
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:07:26
It would affect new people joining the community though, who have no idea what's going on and suddenly think they're buying Bitcoin when infact they're buying Bitcoin Cash. That's probably the last thing we need.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:20:49
Usually clueless people say this :)
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:29:31
The only problem I can see would be if the value of Bitcoin was stable where a few satoshis suddenly became valuable. Even with 1 sat/B the fees would cost alot.
Hopefully Lightning will solve this, so in the future only very big transactions or opening/closing channels will be processed via the mainchain.

Why august 10th? Why not the day of the genisis block? :D
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:36:55
I'm not experienced with the nuance of his tweets but from what I've heard he's openly supporting Trump, on a highkey level, so I'm not really surprised over his tweets. Not sure the two correlate but I would assume so.
Then again, maybe he's just a very passionate anti-fascist and anti-racist, although I think it's more about the fact that it was directed at white people this time. I have not seen him tweet similarly during racism against non-whites.
Then again, these are just wild assumptions and my own opinions. The last thing we need in the crypto-space is a freaking racedebate. Blockchain and Bitcoin don't need that negative energy imo.
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:03:32
The cancer in this world is people that constantly bring up problems without trying to find or give any solutions. Instead of telling him how bad of a job he did in giving us information, perhaps you should instead let him know what kind of information would be useful to share in a situation like this? Just a thought.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:18:49
Ah yes, now that you say it. I remember that one!
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:52:24
As I mentioned I am very inexperienced with how Bitcoin works back-end. But what I essentially mean is that you send to an address which does not exist or that people intentionally burn coins.
Again, I'm very inexperienced with the core functionality of Bitcoin which is why this is interesting for me.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:53:47
Ah, indeed they do get slightly more valuable. My concern was that this would be a long-term problem, where eventually all circulating coins would disappear from the market (assuming Bitcoin has transformed into the world currency).
Obviously this doesn't have to be. Which is why I asked because I am very interested in Bitcoins future!
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:50:57
Yeah as I mentioned, I'm not certain of how Bitcoin works so there might be alot of misunderstanding.
Although I do realize that this would make bitcoin more worth, would it not be an issue in the long run as the lost coins are never to be obtained again? Which would inevitably mean that all [circulating] coins would eventually be lost.
Excuse me for my scrubbyness. I am merely interested and not trying to bash Bitcoin or anything. I am myself a HODLer.
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:04:43
I agree. This is the main reason I started getting interested in Bitcoin from the start. Because of the control you have of your own money. Hopefully this will not change with all the future regulations. Maybe we need to buy our own island, BTCisle.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:31:36
It's a joke. I'm fully aware of Andreas' standpoint :)
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:47:51
What are 50b/100b chips?
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:40:57
Good trail of thought. Of course it is the future, but they just don't want it to be a free future. Hopefully we don't let them win the fight.
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:54:19
Hey man. At the end of the day, the only language we will need is the sound of them sweet sweet satoshis reaching our wallets.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:40:09
Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:39:59
Thanks! Wow, those are big numbers.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:34:05
I appriciate that, sir. I'm soon setting up a Lightning Network node for people who want to help my cause while receiving amazing artwork at the same time.
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:21:56
This is true, however I think the ~~worth~~ price of merchendise compared to wages has been increasing at a much higher pace, no? (This is not grounded in any statistical fact from my side, simply empirical evidence.)
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:15:12
Not at all. It would benefit the systen as a whole according to alot of people though. I guess because of decentralization.
@_date: 2018-07-19 08:02:45
You clearly had a tought breakup with an ex and take it out on other people. Or hard trollin.
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:57:13
Well almost, it's actually Kurdish, Swedish and English (in that order). I also studied Spanish and Latin but that shit don't count because forgot all about it after school.
What about you?
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:20:02
When you say start with BTC I am assuming you're talking about setting up a full-node? Or do you simply mean purchasing BTC?
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:42:18
Still trying to accumulate as much as I can, as a student you need to be careful with your money so I only put as much as I can afford without affecting my lifestyle.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:05:40
My lifestyle is buying course litterature and eating ramen noodles lmfao
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:49:15
What the hell happened, anyone have any clue? Why did the price suddenly spike like this in like 10 minutes?
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:03:02
Those, sir, are bags under the eyes.
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:17:02
Oh god. That is highkey worse.
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:11:23
Oh no wouldn't putting out adresses be a form of begging? Plus I dont want you guys to see the huge amount of Satoshis I have accumulated from selling these drawings. Its over 9000.
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:28:59
That's not a bad idea at all. Time to start schemin' on suckas.
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:10:05
I like how you think.
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:51:14
That's amazing dude, well done!
Do you know perhaps if there is any form of compensation? I would love to translate this into my native language aswell, however it would probably mean I would need cut down on my freelancing which is how I make money currently :/
The alternative would be a slow, week by week translation of course.
@_date: 2018-07-20 07:40:21
This is amazing! Maybe I'll start streaming again JUST because of this. It's fully functional with donation alerts and shiznit?
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:20:41
Which is why the price would increase, no? If the demand is steadily increasing faster at a faster rate than the quantity the price will increase.
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:03:53
Lmao. "Control my money harder, deeper, faster."
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:44:17
Thanks mate. Knowledge is power!
@_date: 2018-07-17 10:23:42
The problem I see with Americans that are so avidly advocating for free use of firearms is that they don't seem bothered at all with the current condition of the country. Atleast try to fix the problems that are present in the country if you're not willing to limit access to firearms. Ask yourselves why the country is slowly descending into chaos and try to fix it (pro tip: it's not because of immigration).
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:06:52
That's pretty cool man, Iraqi Kurds are speaking a dialect known as Soranî, while my dialect is known as Kurmancî (Northern Kurdish). Fun fact! I'm actually trying to contribute to the [bitcoin.org]( website by translating it into Nothern Kurdish which would open up the market to a potential of \~20 million people. I'm having trouble finding the time to do so as I am currently working too much however. Sad life is sad.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:23:03
That escalated quickly 
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:07:21
Praise da lawwwd thank da lawddd for this blessing called the Internet where we can communicate swiftly about less talented minds like this man's right hurr.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:12:15
God bless you too good sir.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:15:40
Thank you for this! Appriciate the explanation.
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:14:55
No I don't think so. Not that I know of atleast.
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:44:24
Yeah, this is exactly my point, might've been a bit diffuse about it. People don't need to know about the backend. They just need to know what the system does and that it actually works. I'd dare to say 90% of people using the Internet have no idea how internet actually works in the backend, all the protocols etc.
So at the end of the day, Bitcoin will be the same if you ask me. Obviously to maximize finiancial freedom to the fullest people should have as much knowledge as possible. This will most likely not be the case however, which we have from time to time seen with new technologies in the past. People embrace, they don't learn about how the backend works (generally).
But yes, you're completely spot on.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:52:38
Oh no, please the price can't climb yet. I MUST ACCUMULATE MOAR COINZ.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:28:04
Lmao I had an argument with them when Bitcoin was 1k USD because once again they refused to let me buy (in my culture we need the blessing of pur parents even when we older) and it went up to 3k and once again they told me no. Then I bought at 6k USD and they felt bad so they lent me some to buy when it was up at 16k USD. I dont need to tell you how that ended ����
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:35:12
I'm planning on making a real fun thing out of Lightning Network. Hopefully it works out so I can showcase it for you guys. It'll be amazing.
@_date: 2018-07-19 04:12:20
Lol what's the bet again?
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:04:01
I wouldn't say it was a mock, more of a joke. Nonetheless, time was not wasted as I am currently at work and I had a small timeperiod where I was not able to be productive. Instead I created this masterpiece. Girlfriend already acquired, thank you for your concern.

My bad, English is my third language so sometimes I make no god damn sense.
@_date: 2018-07-17 09:27:45
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:31:17
I did not really understand what this upgrade does from the article. English is not my primary language. Could someone explain what this upgrade would do and how it would benefit Bitcoin users?
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:46:32
If you put your mind into it, anything can be achieved my man. If you told me 3 hours ago that I would be this successful, I would've laughed.
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:28:18
We engineer it by doing absolutely nothing and letting the world plundge into a pit of chaos because humans are destructive by nature and will eventually fuck themselves up. Cue Bitcoin, saving the world and everything start revolving around satoshis. Assuming the Internet has not been somehow terminated forever or we have set up sattelites to sync the blockchain.

Came here for the avocado. I was dissapointed. There is no avocado.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:36:06
Ah man, that's a bummer. A casualty of the misinformation that Bitcoin Cash supporters spreads.
Unfortunately you habe purchased Bitcoin Cash, which is (not to be confused by the name) not actually Bitcoin. It has its different chain and therefore you cannot send Bitcoin Cash to a Bitcoin Adress and vice versa.
Those money are lost now. Sorry this happened to you. Be sure you're buying BTC next time and not BCH (or double check that ur sending it to the correct currency adress)
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:24:30
What's lightning spin? Just the name intrigues me. I want to know more. Sounds like some form of casino using LN.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:13:44
I'm a scrub. Can someone explain these numbers? "Buy xxxxx @ 7230". What does the xxxx part stand for? (In the BitMEX tweet)
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:03:36
That is very true. I also, sadly, think that people feel secure with others being in charge of their money. People feel like having their money in the bank is safe. Most people would not "feel" safe having all of their money in a hardware wallet for example, because they would feel vurnerable. I think this could eventually make the purpose of Bitcoin obsolete for the majority of the users. They might for example start using Bitcoin and proceed to have a "bank" take care of it for them, like alot of exchanges today.
Not that it would be a problem for the rest of us since the adoption will increase the price and availability/usability but just the thought of a decentralized currency being used in a centralized way by the masses makes me sad for real.
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:08:42
That is a great explanation dude. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:45:32
Lmfao. I actually saw the resemblance as soon as I read his name. It's supposed to be Anton though.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:20:09
Food is life �� im just gonna accumulate BTC thru my amazing drawings. Check my previous posts for context.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:25:31
I mean. Unless you have your Bitcoins at an exchange that actively cooperates with a specific government (or adheres to their legal actions) or your private key is compromised I can't really see any other ways for anyone to confiscate your Bitcoin. If you have some form of hardware wallet, for example, and have your private key/seed in the same place (perhaps in your house) it would be very easy to get a warrant and confiscate them.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:01:56
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:40:22
For my bext drawing it will most definitely be positive and I will dedicate it to you!
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:25:28
You forgot one.
5. Trying to purchase Bitcoin in 2011 but ~~you're~~ you were a minor so your parents laughed at you and told you to fuck off and prohibited you from using your own money and you would've been a multi-millionarie by now.
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:22:31
Yes. It is possible. Is it easy? I wouldn't say so.
Not only is there a people tricking you, you also have to follow your countrys tax-rules and other regulations (if you wish to do it legally of course). I know that in Sweden this is a huge process and I was considering doing the exact thing you proposed but I backed out because I felt like it wouldn't be worth it in the end.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:15:40
I'm really looking forward to this taking off but I have to say, it does indeed look like a few hubs are developing. BCash shills use this as an argument against Lightning Network. I'm not really 100% educated about the Lightning Network although I try to read as much as I can about it.
Can anyone explain to me why the bcash shills use the hubs as an argument against LN (is it because of "centralization"?) and if indeed what we see on the pictures are hubs? If they are, would it be a negative or positive thing? Since if a hub closes (albeit not likely) then all the connected channels will close too right? Atleast the route to the hub (and shutdown completely if it's the only route it has active?)
Sorry if my questions and my assumptions are kinda off, I'm just trying to learn as much as I can!
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:58:34
Thanks for the replies guys. Not sure why I am getting downvoted, I came to thia subreddit to learn why are ppl upset over questions?
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:26:09
Imo, the money should be used on Search Engine Optimization aswell as compensation for contributers who take alot of their time to help improve the site. Alot of people would be able to translate languages that are not currently available on the site if they would get some form of compensation, it doesn't need to be huge. Some people just can't waste those amounts of hours for free since they have rents to pay.
Are there any plans for compensations to contributors to the site?
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:24:06
No matter how nice it would be, unfortunately I don't think we've reached a tipping point at all when it comes to liking crypto more than fiat. Most people in the world don't even own Bitcoin, let alone know about it or care about it.
But good initiative dude, moves like this is what will eventually make people favor crypto more!
