You do realize that when an "insider" sell that ***signals to the market*** that the stock/coin is "'overpriced" (even if the reason for selling is like you said). 
But what you're saying is that ***NONE*** of his early coins have left those wallets??? (if so, he has some mighty-fine hodling skills)

The [sandy hook assault weapon prevention charity]( if you are left-leaning. 
Or a good libertarian charity if you are politically right-leaning.

why does everyone believe he deleted his keys for the pre-mine?

Thank you ***so much*** for the offer for help. It motivated me to think creatively on a side project I'm working on which allowed me to expand the scope of the side project to an extremely broader scope that I wouldn't have even contemplated had I not felt the optimism your statement (that I'm replying to) has generously provided. I've got a bit address and private key now and that's all I needed to get started, thanks!

just for the political newbies -- what's the typical republican policy on privacy? (I thought that went out the window in the name of "terrorism"?)

I'm a nooby -- is there any general guess on how many BTC that Wikileaks currently owns or hold from donations sent to them?

Fortunately you didn't study biology or chemistry and Le Chetelier's principle doesn't ruin the word "equilibrium" for you. Lucky bastard!
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:17:09
Yeah you're right -- that's like saying a duck or a tree is legal. I'm a noob and you have busted me, lol.

If your political opponent does it -- you're forced to either 
 * take the moral high ground or 
 * stay competitive and join the fray

Sure -- it's a very minor distinction but markets react more to expectations rather than discussions. Since the two are related (discussions might affect expectations) it can be a distinction that is often overlooked. Calm sensible discussions which are presented in such a way that appear to be information everyone already knows (whether explicitly or implicitly) is remarkably stabilizing on price volatility.
For example, if gold closed at $900 today. The best way for commentators and internet discussions threads to react is to act like "we all knew gold was over-priced and this correction was long overdue since the general consensus is $1000/ounce reflects fair market value"
It's deceptive and shady but I have no skin in the game. I'm just happy to share my knowledge in finance and capital markets. Does this make sense as I attempted to explain it?
@_date: 2016-11-09 18:35:01
yeah until it blew up in popularity

This sentence misses the mark slightly... but it's not a significant qualm so I won't comment further unless requested to do so. 
Your last sentence is 100% perfect.

For the newbies, do you mean by this term *to enter a period of non-growth &amp; non-decline?*
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:32:07
That's the method I used (have less than 1 bitcoin because it's my hot wallet) there's nothing more sinister than me possibly losing just a half bitcoin right? Your comment has made me worried.

Holy shit I been looking for this exact info, THANKS!!!

I'm confused are you essentially saying paper wallet creators aren't reliable?

Thank you for writing that easy enough for a beginner to understand. :-)
