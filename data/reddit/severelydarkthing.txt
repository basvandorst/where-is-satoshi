There is many GPT (Get paid to ) websites but is hard to get 300 bucks a month on them .  If you need this money look for beermoney.

First of all , you are a great dad =)
Second - Even with referrals faucets and pay to click websites are very hard to make a significant amount of money . If you are too broke is better than nothing but still there is more ways to get money
Third - You can buy a bit of bitcoin every month or get into mining shitcoins
Fourth - If you think bitcoin is important you will find a way . I know a guy who started with faucets then started writing content , some people get into trading ( is really difficult ) , anyway just keep trying .

What is the best way to store bitcoin if you dont have money for a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:12:49
Go to foxyrating to find the legit sites .  You can use faucets , ptc and gpt sites , the most effective way is GPT sites where you can answer surveys (you can get a lot more than faucets and ptcs) . 
Remember not your kees not your bitcoin , don't trust anyone. By the way what site are you using?
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:38:13
Use foxyrating to see if the sites are legit , they are not perfect but their work is pretty good. You can use GPT sites (where you can do many tasks includin surveys),but check the minimum withdrawal.
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:28:42
You can not buy via P2P ? My country (Brazil) is the same thing , check if there is any community on facebook or something
