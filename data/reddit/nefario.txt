Not happening, there was an attempt to do just this and I de-listed it (this was before new assets had to be approved before being listed).
The story is simple, my identity is not a secret, and GLBSE runs in regular internet.
How fast do you think the police are going to be in arresting me and shutting down GLBSE for this?
If you want to have a stock market for illegal goods, it needs to be run from inside a dark net otherwise it will be shut down and everyone prosecuted.

Look at GLBSE.com for example, sure it's small right now but it allows people to get funding for their company without all the bullshit.

No, an integer is a whole number (1 or 55, 1.0 is not an integer). By having EVERYTHING stored as an integer we avoid the dangers of floating point errors, also since bitcoins are actually represented as integers it makes more sense that way.
@_date: 2012-05-25 19:24:51
I would say neither, you want something that is going to create a return by creating value, start or invest in a business that gets it's value by taking advantage of bitcoins strength (not just a bitcoin paid version of a normal business, which is likely to fail)

Messy, the whole lot. Seems that a ticking time bomb was handed off to bitcoin consultancy that then exploded just after they got it.... and they've just lost their fingers.

Not going to happen.
Until a few days ago, as far as pirate was concerned he only dealt with people who had accounts with him, and specifically stated that he has no connection or anything to do with "sub-accounts" which is what he is calling pass throughs, he has stated this in PM's and on forum threads.
He also knows that GLBSE can't (and won't) release those details to some random third party, and issuers will not request it (neither would we release it to them). 
Also this leads to the question of why? Why would pirate be looking for such information? In the least it is a stalling tactic, worst its something much more sinister.
I would say it is against everyones interests to give him any information.

I'm really just playing, like you ask what ratio of money (I assume you mean your overall savings) should be bitcoin.
Well obviously 100% would be the most stupid answer, but actually the question is a little silly I think. 
Bitcoins in your wallet are not savings, it's mostly a kind of investment and it's a risky one. 
So really the question you need to be asking is, how much can you afford to lose? And the amount you keep in bitcoin should be less than this number, adjust for your own capacity to stomach risk.
The phrase is, if you ask a stupid question, you get a stupid answer. Don't take that part serious though.

scrypt is less proven than bcrypt.
@_date: 2012-08-07 08:15:15
I don't think so, I think that the "taint" will be spread through the entire bitcoin ecosystem fairly evenly, they won't be able to pinpoint anyone.
For example, I know that there are a large number of GLBSE users who just deposit funds into GLBSE, leave it there for a few days to churn, then withdraw.
It really will be like dollar bills with cocain on them, as in 80% have it (eventually most coins are going to be tainted).

Incorrect, all bitcoin balances(and therefor arithmetic)  are stored as integers accurate to the 8th decimal place, and are only converted to decimal for presentation purposes.

He didn't really know anything about bitcoin when he arrived, but by the time he left (after getting his GNU back) he had something of an interest and was asking how he could get some.
@_date: 2012-09-14 12:01:35
The point of GLBSE is to allow people to invest in projects in the bitcoin economy, the purpose of which being 1. to create the needed services for the economy to function, 2. to hopefully get a good return on their investment.
GLBSE has been incredibly successful in a few areas, mining funds being one, it's a direct result of all the investments going through GLBSE that Butterfly labs has been able to get enough pre-orders to build their ASIC's.
I don't believe the bitcoin economy would grow very much (and bitcoin itself be worth very much) without the needed economic services that all functioning economies have.
@_date: 2012-09-22 18:51:03
Well to be fair, Stallman was understandably annoyed at us. Someone had taken his GNU, and he was unhappy that he would have to start calling it Linux.
@_date: 2012-08-02 19:32:09
Seems either way, users are getting their coins back, or a significant amount of them.

He's real, Intersango have met him.
@_date: 2012-07-20 08:28:42
The costs are fixed in fiat (what fiat currency wasn't mentioned). Besides the tickets are paid in bitcoin, with the price being set in fiat, it's just easy that way(would you rather us having to update the price every 30 minutes to accommadate the recent changes in bitcoin?). 
It would be a lack of confidence if we didn't accept bitcoin as the method of payment.
@_date: 2012-05-20 21:12:47
This is actually really cool, I'd love to add this as the default option to GLBSE for...disputes

There is none, Intersango was the only show in town.
@_date: 2012-08-06 18:18:52
Intersango itself is a separate entity(from Bitcoinica). The reason for low volume on GBP with them is their bank was investigating their account (fairly standard). 
This was for about 2 weeks and is now finished, Intersango are working their way through the bancklog.
TLDR- Bank delays.
@_date: 2012-07-28 07:13:36
They're not just refering to cash in bank account when talking about assets but also servers, which were based in the US and which Megaupload probably wont be getting back.

Pretty much this
@_date: 2012-05-13 21:06:08
No, it's still owned by the original investor that bought it off Zhou. Intersango run it, so not the same.
@_date: 2012-09-04 00:23:53
You need to check that yourself as an investor, but I'm working on a way of getting more and better information out into the market.
@_date: 2012-09-04 11:47:48
It's to set a stable base price, since the costs for sponsorship is in GBP, payable in bitcoin though.

Even though this is being down voted it's technically correct(the best kind of correct).
Basically what we have here is a massive flaw in the WOT model, and those who rely on it alone are at risk. 
A WOT only works when that web is small, the bigger it is the less effective it is.

What about timesharing?
AirBnB for bitcoin? Even better (for tax reasons) cause it doesn't go through the bank
@_date: 2012-08-28 06:07:21
Firstly GLBSE is a real stock market, you can buy and sell shares, options and more on it. It's not regulated (and I don't think it could be even if we wanted to, because everything is denominated in bitcoin).
Secondly if you don't know how a stock market works you shouldn't be investing in a stock market, more so for one denominated in bitcoins and for types of shares that are considerably different to what other exchanges trade.
Over all if you don't become familiar with how markets work and make a considerable effort to research what you're investing in you will lose your money, and therefor I would not recommend you start trading on GLBSE or any other bitcoin market for that matter.
I'm nefario and I run GLBSE.

You're using an android device to view the site, there is no mobile version of GLBSE, please use a Chrome, WebKit, or Mozilla based browser.
@_date: 2012-05-25 19:22:49
Very true, there are some great assets on GLBSE but you have to read the contracts (and for historical reasons,on or two assets don't have any contract, at least on GLBSE itself).
A lot of problems people have when using the website is caused by not reading, contracts or the sites own instructions.
@_date: 2012-05-21 23:50:34
Actually thats not how it worked. Amir started Intersango because he thought it was needed by the bitcoin economy and community.

I don't use Bitcoinica so I don't have any stake in it, this is just my observation/ opinion on what seems like outlandish profits.
@_date: 2012-06-13 10:18:52
There is also a lot of large scale fraud that goes on, especially with Chinese companies that are listed on Western exchanges.
A "rumor" is released showing good news about a particular stock(again, usually a Chinese company), the price goes up, the people who started the rumor make a killing, and the company comes out a few days later saying actually there was no good news.
@_date: 2012-07-28 20:58:03
There are ony three possible methods for the police to have caught this guy.
1) noticed it was drugs when customs checked incoming international post (most likely)
2) the profile that sold him the drugs were the police(entrapment, not too likely)
3) a seller is a police informant (not likely)
The use of bitcoin itself and silkroad is not really what is at issue here. If you are planning on buying drugs off silkroad, ensure that the seller is in the same country as you, this will prevent the package going through customs.

Changes will be arriving next week on GLBSE that will increase liquidity, one of the issues is that only one buy order can be made using BTC, once done that BTC is tied up.
The upcoming change will allow multiple orders to be placed, once an order is filled others will be canceled.
