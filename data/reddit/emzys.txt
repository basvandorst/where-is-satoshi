185VJnon7wxgCkRv2bbfZzWkktGz5xnbWt is the uncompressed Adress and 17CNy6h74cpQDfubYD1tizm5DgoPyezmto is the compressed. 
Compressed should be used my most wallets today.

If you like to have no logging of IP and Bitcoin Addresses you can use kirsche.emzy.de as Server. 
The log file goes straight to /dev/null

trezor is designed to resist reading the secret keys. If you cracked the lock code on the iOS device you can simply read all the files on the device also the secret keys. Even Without jailbreak.
Maybe you have a password on the keys, thats the only thing that will protect the keys then.

Video that shows how to crack the iPhone passcode
Also the keychain is locked with the same passcode.

The iOS device is not secure if it is stolen! It isn,t designed for that. 
You can easily break the lock code, by booting alternative software on the device.
There is even law enforcement software to break the lock code. 
Only change is a fast remote wipe.

shred -u Wallet.seed
leaves the contents of the file physically on a flash (thumb-dive and SD-Card)
A better way is:
gpg2 --symmetric &gt; Wallet.seed.gpg
Enter your passphrase and copy and paste the seed. After pasting press CTRL and d

Btcd written in GO is running fine on my Banana PI.
The first sync was on a other PC, because the Banana PI is only twice as fast as the blocks that come in.

Welcome! I did the same. The full Node is running for years. Electrum half a year.

The 31c3 is a german hacker congress and the "Seidenstraße" (which means silk road in english, but don't confuse it with the darknet silkroad) is a system of tubes from a group of artists which installed this in the building where the 31c3 congress was at. So visitors can send stuff through these tubes, like love letters or hard drives. The point here is that you can make a bitcoin transaction with a physical piece of paper. It's just for fun, and the installation only was temporary. But you can theoretically use a piece of paper to make a bitcoin transaction offline, without internet connection.
Some additional pictures:

It took 40 minutes... Have fun with it, if you get it :)
There is still a double spend possible.

Is sending the private key not an alternativ to it?

One part for privacy is missing.
Start your electum client with option oneserver.
"electrum --oneserver" 
This option starts Electrum in "one server" mode. When you open the Network dialog, you will see "Getting block headers from 1 node".

I definitely agree. Actually I sometimes had to correct myself as I was  talking about Lighting payments. So that it is clear that the payment  was made in Bitcoin.

Cool. 100 bits
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:46:19
Awesome! But why is Bitcoin send via Lightning listed as LNX on the deposit page? This advertise the notion that Bitcoin via Lightning is a different Token, which it is not. Maybe a implementation choice. But bad UX.
