How serious is this "glitch"? 
Ninja edit. Seems this problem is more with the exchanges than with bitcoin it's self. How hard is this to fix?

On my unit, in broad daylight by the jman.

Are there any other crypto currencies worth mining?

I would like the option to get paid in bitcoins for selling stuff on ebay......

So, for eobot. They are paying out cash currently @ 15 a month for using one of those sticks. I have an environment when I can run 24x7 so it makes sense and takes some of the hassle out of dealing with btc. If all goes well, i should make my money back in less than 5 months. They just started supporting the sticks so I would be a little surprised if the price drop that they are giving for them. They are selling them at 90 so I doubt they would want to waver much on that as it would cause issues with their sales. As for hardware failure, is it common for the miners to give up the ghost? How long do they last on average?

The ones I am looking at now are about 67 each for a 5 pack. I should be able to make my money back via eobot in about 4.5 months. That doesn't seem like a bad turn around but I could be missing something. Would it make sense to get these, then use the profits to get the blade later on for solely btc mining? Do you know if these devices can be used for anything other than btc mining once they get outdated?

I use [Cryptsy]( Been having great luck with them and they also have a rewards style program if you do a lot of trading with them.

That's a lot of good information. I was thinking of getting into the mining on a small scale but it's starting to sound like I missed the boat on this one. Oh well right? Thank you for the info.
