"If you don't HODL you're a complete pussy"
And this is why you shouldn't take financial advice from strangers on the internet.

Does this incentivise (sp?) me to run a full node yet? I'm glad that miners are still getting their cut and the microtransaction experience is better but I feel like the full node community is carrying a huge responsibility without much reward. Am I missing something?

huge burden != huge responsibility
BTC remains decentralized because of the people that run full nodes. Sure it might only take 30 min to set one up, but how many people actually do it?

I'm worried that means fewer people will want to run a full node and that would centralize power to those that can afford to run one with full time security and a hot wallet.

The US government lost its AAA credit rating for the first time then? I'm pretty sure that tanked the USD.

HODL like your life depends on it. DO NOT cash out unless your life or well being depends on it. The question isn't how much value is BTC in terms of dollars, it's how much the dollar has less value vs BTC. Why sell something that's growing at a scary rate for something that keeps depreciating?
