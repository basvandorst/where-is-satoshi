The truth is criminals have no other option than Bitfinex &amp; BTC-e, where only Bitfinex offers the leverage trading option.

Was not BTCC founded before CoinBase too? Have they ever been hacked?

Wrong title. It is not only on the front page on it is on the home page or reddit itself.
@_date: 2016-11-15 15:10:59
Honesty is a relative word. In many country politicians use the taxed money as their parental property. They make government deals to spend the tax money and take a commission from those deals. Hence, for many, bitcoin is great as an alternative payment network out of Government's reach.

It does not take more than a few seconds to create a new reddit account over Tor.

Nice to see some people still do understand the true value proposition of bitcoin.

I'm not very knowledgeable about India. But, Bitcoin works great over the internet for digital goods &amp; services and the internet economy is more or less same in every nation state (except North Korea, Mainland China etc).

Nopes. What's that?

OP is wrong in comparing Bill Gates with Bitcoin. The comparison should be between Microsoft Stocks &amp; Bitcoin and Bill Gates &amp; Satoshi Nakamoto.

I respect owners of bitdice.me &amp; chain-bet.com as well. But, they did not put in much effort to create an unique online identity like four of you.

One is building rocket for Astronauts (BTC) and another is building roof for homeless (BCH). Mission is different... so is the solution.
But, S2X is like asking for a roof for a rocket. This is disgusting.

Well, this Tx had nothing to do with BTC to FIAT conversion. It was a winning payment from chain-bet.com.

I think, they build on  while u r checking

I'll be happy if (1 BTC + 1 BCC + 1 S2X) = 10k USD

I personally believe, u still have much more than 95 BTC in storage. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:46:06
Well, after that? I mean after bitcoin reached $1?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:19:03
Your loss is close to half a million dollar. And u know, its not going to come back. So, use it. Contact media for a paid interview and buy back bitcoin with that money. The block size debate will end up in 2017 only and bitcoin price is gonna shoot up in 2018. There is possibility to make up for your loss. Good Luck.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:08:03
Welcome to Bitcoin :-)

Depends on your country. If u r in places like Syria, Lybia or Nigeria ...then better dont.

Has the bank provided u a letter identifying the buyer and mentioning his claim? It is possible that the bitcoin buyer got access to someone else's account and sent u the fund. 
Does Brazil recognizes bitcoin transaction as legitimate? Your best option is to file a counter police complaint against the buyer.

Who would enforce these patents in China &amp; Russia? China seems to not care about international court's regulation about South China Sea. Russian president said he does not care about a skinny man, i.e. Obama and went on with attacking Ukraine. U really expect that they'll honor some Canadian patent?
