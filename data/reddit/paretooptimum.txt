People don’t always work like coin tosses.  I’d argue you can read a lot more out of human behaviour- particularly in extreme cases - than is contained in the basic Stats textbook. The dog hasn’t barked for years... what is the probability he barks tomorrow? Less this if he barked every day?

Yea dude, I think that too when I’m smoking pot, while listening to dub and reading the book revelations. Oh no, wait, I’m thinking of Babylon.

I’m so glad bitcoin is so pure and clean. No price manipulation or shady practices. Why it’s like  living in the great days of banking past like the 1830’s. And all the rest of the clean and honest crypto currency community and all those nice men selling their fresh new ICO from door to door, are they wonderful. Reminds me of the great days just before the Great Depression. Ah those were the days. /s

He’s not dead, just frozen. Like Walt. When we develop revival technology in 2137, then he will cause the global crash.

Frozen. Like Walt. Keeping his coins to pay for his revival.

Dude is frozen. Invented bitcoin so he could pay to for his revival in the future. Seriously. Read up.

The Fact that the Roman Empire has ended has zero bearing on the “odds” they will send someone out to repair it? The fact that dinosaurs dies out has zero bearing on the “odds” one will appear tomorrow?  Where does your model end?

Not all sets of discrete measurements are full of individual samples with no relationship to or bearing on any other. This type of abstract casino statistics is relatively rare in the real world. You may find some value in reading up on the "Lindy effect". If you are as interested in statistics as you seem, you might also enjoy Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

We may be talking over each other or not listening, so you may realise some of this... 
"We don't know that Satoshi hasn't moved coins."
INCORRECT: We know of a number of addresses associated with Satoshi, including the Genesis Address (1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa) and (12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S). Coins have not moved from these addresses since he went silent.
"If someone makes the dog bark, he'll damn well bark, regardless of what he did in the past."
INCORRECT: You appear to ignore time. Coin flips in an abstract mathematical casino of the classroom are not analogous to the real world in all situations. The oldest dog for which we have records is 29 years and 5 months. A dog that has not barked for 50 years is different to a dog that barked yesterday. 
If Satoshi was an individual, every minute, day and year that goes by takes him closer to death. You seem to me to be arguing that Satoshi is just as likely to reappear tomorrow, 100 years from now or a million years from now. On every given morning from now on to the end of time, there is an individual "sample" unlinked in any way to all previous samples? 
"We have, essentially, zero hard data on Satoshi, so your statements miss the point in two different ways"
INCORRECT: We have a lot more than "essentially zero" information on Satoshi. For example, "Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. Because this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time." We have samples of his writing style.

Wow. The price of electricity and bitminers is sure going to have to go up then, hey?

You model may be incorrect. Let’s try this one on for size: Chinese government officials are corrupt and always looking for a special payment. They have realised shaking down organisations that exchange somewhat untraceable digital money is, how can I put this, fruitful. Of course they come back again and again.

 When the boy finished, he offered Kennedy a stock tip: "Buy Hindenburg." Kennedy soon sold off his stocks, thinking:
“You know it's time to sell when shoeshine boys give you stock tips. This bull market is over.”

This crazy talk is getting just a little out of control. I’m willing to bet the OP doesn’t mine. I have A Bitmain Antminer in my spare room. Forget what it cost. I put electricity in and bitcoins come out. This sets an ultimate ceiling. Let’s not even start discussing the fact that the 21 million limit is a line of code in some software, not the divine word itself. This too will change.

This is being painted as either “lots more immediately” or “none.” And therefore immediate loss due to dilution. When the day comes, there will be a strong strong incentive for all miners to push for just continued emission at some level. Sure continued emission of coins is ultimately inflationary but as Keynes said: In the long run we are all dead.

As your economist, I’m 100% sure the price of bitcoins is a product of supply and demand. Someone here is making what NNT called the green lumber fallacy, and it’s not me. 
“The Green Lumber fallacy refers to the disconnect between academic knowledge and real world results. Between theory and practice. Between talking and doing.
The “Green Lumber” descriptor comes from a story of a commodities trader who traded “green lumber”, also known as freshly cut wood.
This trader was the top trader for green lumber, globally. One day his colleague asked him if he knew what green lumber is.
The star trader’s answer: Wood that is painted green.
Turns out the star trader didn’t have a clue what green lumber was. But that didn’t matter. The only thing that mattered is that he was successful at trading it.”

He’s frozen. Ok, dead and frozen but with a lot of incentive stored away to revive him.  How else can you take it with you. Of course the risk in 2234 when they revive him will be his triggering a global economic meltdown.

Get your facts straight people.
Unlike most people commenting, I have a mining contract with them. My experience has been the do exactly what they say, I have made a good return and they pay every day.
They have resumed payments. The say they will make up the missing few days. It was only the local hot wallet.

Frozen. He’s planning to use his coins when he is revived. (True story)
