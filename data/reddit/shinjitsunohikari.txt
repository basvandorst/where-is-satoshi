:) That's surely a possibility. Though there are multiple other emails with "satoshi" in them and they weren't pwned from BitcoinTalk. So at least it's not super common that someone with "satoshi" in their email registered on BitcoinTalk before 2015. But of course it might have happened this time!

I wish I had problems like this :)

Someone registered with that email on Myspace before 2008, because it was pwned from there then. Now, when you search on Myspace with that email, that person comes up.
Someone has also used it on an Indonesian e-commerce site (and many other sites too) and probably you're going to use your real email on a shopping site. Also, Muhammad NurSyazani is a Malaysian name, possibly also Indonesian. So, probably it's the same person who used it on Myspace and who used it on the Indonesian shopping site

I thought about it a lot whether it's ethical to post this or not... But if it's actually Satoshi, he gave a clue by writing "nour" on the P2P site. If he gives clues, then he's playing the game and he can't be against someone finding his identity that much. But maybe it was the hacker wrote it....

Didn't overlook: "he might have become interested in Bitcoin because he shares a name (or username/nickname) with the founder"

Satoshi is just a human and can make mistakes. He probably made a mistake at some point

Haha. What kind of ulterior motive? I just want to solve the puzzle/mystery/whatever
For what it's worth, stylometric analysis always groups Finney apart from Satoshi
