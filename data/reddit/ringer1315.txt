Yeah, either way definitely price manipulation going on. No way in hell its worth that much

Cash out and then withdraw 10k a day. Or apply for the increase

Nobody buy 9.5k for a BCH. I can almost promise you coinbase’s BCH deposits are congested and the whales are manipulating into buying at 9.5k who have cash accounts on coinbase. It’s all manipulation, do not bite.

Are you upset you sold? Just curious if you lose sleep over FOMO even though you have already accomplished so much.

Does this mean transaction fees will go up recycling more BTC into the mining reward pool? 
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:32:02
Yeah don’t sell. But if you want to use limit orders on coinbase pro. It’s free

Yeah, wait till trump's new tax plan kicks in so you get taxed at 35% from 500k to a mil instead of 39.6%. Or pull it out in portions spread it out over a couple different years so you get taxed at a lower rate.

I know, right? If people could stop uploading shit to v.reddit that would be nice. It’s cancer trying to share the video without linking the actual reddit post
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:00:53
How can I save the video? Please don’t use vreddit
