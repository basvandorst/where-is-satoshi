Only the new comers. The people who invested years ago believe in the technology and possibilities. The people who only believe in BTC for getting rich are the newbies who will stay poor. But that's cool to have your misinformed opinion and all.

That's not what I said at all lol, there is a community who cares above r crypto more than just an easy BTC investment. Some care for the technology and the potential to overthrown the current banking system. Not everyone here wants to sell their Crypto back into fiat currency some like to use it as a currency and not just an investment. Crypto is more than just making money. It's a future eco in iCal concept that we might one day in our everyday lives

The reason Bitcoin is rising in popularity is because people don't like the centralized banking system, Bitcoin is the complete opposite, we don't want to be them.

It makes me sick seeing Visa trying to push for a refund system for the blockchain. Everything is getting too corporate these days with all the normie sheeple buying into the blockchain system. Banks are just trying to earn a piece of a pie they were not invited to eat.

Curious in regards as to why Litecoin wouldn't be classified under a like-kind exchange, both are the same product: Cryptocurrency, even though the degree of quality is different. 
The proper definition for like-kind exchange is this: 
"Properties are of like
kind if they are of the same nature or
character, even if they differ in grade or
quality. Personal properties of a like class
are like-kind properties"

Do you have any information on Cryptocurrency taxation policy?
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:04:47
Because a stock and currency are two different things.
