People keep saying $20000, which to me is more likely. Hopefully, we'll see a rise in the price by the end of the year, which I hear is what usually happens. I'm not sure it will go up to $20000 but that's the hope.

Because a lot of people seemed to be upset with the bitcoin price constantly going down and not getting back up even after how many months of stability. Also, there's not a big bump in number of people who gets into bitcoin despite its stability this year. Seems to me that something else has to happen that will make more people start using bitcoin. What exactly, I have no idea.

China seems to be winning because of their blockchain-related projects. Plus, with the amount of budget they have set for AI related projects, it's only a matter of time til they combine blockchain and AI. They've already got the money to back it up, they only now need to come up with a solution on how to do it.

Imagine running into some kids on the road and they challenged him for a race and OP actually won. Those kids will surely have their jaws dropped on the floor. If it were me I'd look at them all smugly and say, "it's bitcoin, bitch" when they ask how. Those kiddos will be left on the dust wondering wtf I just said.

Comparing bitcoin to using plastic is a bad example though because there are a lot of people using plastic, so much so that it's become a worldwide problem. I agree on the bitcoin-stocks though. A lot of people are aware that cryptocurrency and bitcoin exists, but they don't use it because the exchange is high and common people can't afford it. It also doesn't help that bitcoin has been associated with scams and dark web and people using it for illegal activities.

OP should take this truck for a test drive and upload it everywhere on social media. Maybe this will serve as a motivator for people to want to start using bitcoin. And that's just OP's profits for one month. Get the word out and people will be clamoring to join the crypto world.

Yes I know, but despite the number of people using bitcoin around the world, it's still not enough for us to say that bitcoin is a reserved currency. I believe though that someday, maybe in a decade or two, that the number of bitcoin users around the world will double or triple. I'm just not sure every single person on the globe will be on to it.

When the human civilization collapses due to climate change or other man-made problems, do you think bitcoin - as the world's reserve currency - will help us recover? What can miners and users even do?
On the other hand, it's hard to believe this will happen because not all country knows about bitcoin, let alone have access to a computer or internet.

This is my issue with people saying bitcoin is one of the reasons global warming is worsening. Between gold and bitcoin mining alone, gold mining is much worse even though bitcoin takes more energy. Now, compare bitcoin mining to factories that burn fossil fuels. Which one is worst again?
