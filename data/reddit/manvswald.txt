Yes, the Union7 LND Thin Wallet: [union7wallet.com](
It is available for download via the App Store and works on main net: [

Note that this is also mainnet and allows you to bring your own LND node running anywhere.  More details at lndthinwallet.com

You need to be running an LND node somewhere, yes.

This is an interesting discussion.  If you define wallet as a "mobile node", and note that it's unclear that wallets will or should be mobile nodes in the future \(e.g., by this definition, Acinq which is a mobile node is a wallet, but it can't receive payments\), it's not.   If you define wallet as something allows you to make decentralized payments and receive decentralized payments, it's a wallet.

Yeah it's technical in that you need to be running your own LND node right now and be able to dump out cert, etc. \- which is to say almost definitely too technical for widespread consumer adoption.  Next step is allowing you to easily spin up a remote LND node that connects automatically so that anyone can just download and start using. 
Beyond that, if you have an feedback on usability of the app once your node is connected please let me know!

No worries!  I don't think Apple displays release date but App Annie tracks it \(free login\) [ and there are also some bots that tweet about new apps on the App Store \- e.g.,

Not yet.  Obviously this is important for people to use it, but right now it's limited to people running LND already anyway.  I plan to release the source when I'm able to pair the wallet with a node \(which would make it accessible to all consumers\), and of course most people will download from App Store store anyway rather than building manually in xcode, which means the source could be anything.  Imagining users for this first version will be early adopters wanting to just play around with LND or develop Lapps with small amounts on mainnet, which, fwiw is the same disclaimer given for people running LND which is in beta.

Thank you for adding it!  FWIW, might be worth adding a column for whether the wallet supports receive \(mobile nodes don't\), and whether it requires a cloud node, which is a subtle but important difference from requiring a "previous" node \(e.g., Shango requires a cloud node though arguably not a "previous" node since it will spin one up for you it looks like\).  Presumably spinning up a node will incur a significant cost too.  Also I released this app back in April.

First mainnet wallet!
