consumer spending is a *huge* part of how you get out of a recession most prominent economists I'd have to assume would agree with.

moderate inflation in the long term can be an indicator of a healthy economy.
more importantly long term deflation or hyper inflation is not a good sign for the economy.
so to answer your question, for you.

Didn't you just say 


Then you bring up the appeal to authority fallacy?
Anyways just to be clear are you saying consumer spending does not help the economy?

Check my post history I wonder all around political and economic subreddits. But anyways I hate when people equate free thinking or intelligence with "fighting the man", it is such a bad way to view things and just leads to people being closed minded and not willing to accept reality because shills, it's the man, that's what they want you to think, or take your pick of any other conspiracy line. 
Trust me if I got paid to shill on Reddit I wouldn't be doing it in r/bitcoin you guys are relentless I got like 15 post notification messages in the last few hours

Wait are you saying inflation causes easy access to capital for the wealthy? If so **what???** do you mean the fed's interest rates? 
I'm a bit confused on what you are trying to say but I'll try my best.
I'm not going to argue whether or not US's inflation is optimal but I will say it is better to have what we have no instead of long term hyper inflation or deflation. 


There can be an argument for lowering the fed's interest rates is stealing growth from the future but it seems to be working at least to decrease the severity and longevity of recessions.
Way to many replies and too little time to keep doing this so going to stop it here (got two new replies when I was writing this, meh).

You don't think spending is how you get out of a recession? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:50:54
ya pretty sure, if we can bring back gladiator fights though that would be good

I have a couple issues with this write up. It totally disregards the economic situation of when they take the data from. Their whole conclusion could be totally wrong if you take in account of the economic situation around low and high inflation. *Usually* controlled inflation means the economy is healthy and deflation or hyperinflation means the opposite. 
Just because there is more spending as a percent doesn't mean there is more spending in the total economy (and we can both agree more spending is better) if the economy is in the shitter. I'd like to see long term how does an economy with deflation versus healthy inflation fare. Also I will still stand by my point that there is more spending in a country with healthy inflation then in a country with deflation **especially** in the long term.
tl;dr: article thinks that less savings as a percent means the consumer is spending less which is completely false(unless I'm missing something?)

never seen that, thanks I'll watch it when I get home

have you predicted the last 8 out of 0 crashes also? 
Jokes aside it's unreasonable to say that any major currency not to mention a reserve currency will be worthless.

have fun with your phobia of economics, misleading pictures, conspiracies, and weak or non existing argument.
I'd much rather you argue with me of why but I don't think you can.

You might as well give me inflation numbers. Not a big fan of inflation? Don't see why not if prices were decreasing you can guarantee consumers wouldn't be spending as much.

You don't think it's a good idea to allow easy access to capital when there is a recession? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:14:50
Why are you saying *real* capital? 
There is such a thing as easier access to capital. 
Also when did I ever even imply that the capital was hard assets? That wouldn't even make any sense. 
edit: op edited is comment after I posted mine just to clarify before the edit OP was saying that I was assuming there were hard assets that we haven't been allowed to us which didn't make sense therefore my reply
