So I'm a Bitcoin investor since 2012, you could see the innovation then.  Now I just see miners eating up all the profit - so I'm asking why do miners get paid all of the transaction fees and not the Bitcoin holders?  I love Bitcoin, but as a businessman I need to objectively consider moving to a profitable business model
Is DPOS BitShares going to take Bitcoin technology and actually make it profitable for the shareholders?

I've been following Bitcoin since 2012 and the longer we've been from it's major rise, the more I agree that we need to move the tech forward. The hedges into competing businesses is the best way I see to be part of this.  Thanks for the video
