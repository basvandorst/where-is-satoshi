“I cannot do the Satoshi bit anymore,” he wrote. “They no longer listen. I am better as a myth.”
* Satoshi didn't stop doing the "Satoshi bit" because "they no longer listen." He stopped because Bitcoin started working without him.  
* Satoshi always had to be a myth. How else could a global currency ever come into being? If a single man created it, then it has a worldly (debased) agenda. If it simply came into being, then its' mythical creator can be understood as benevolent, and his creation can be accepted as such.
The above quote indicates that Dr. Wright doesn't understand the importance of the gravity of Satoshi's myth, and so he is not likely Satoshi.

Nothing more than what's referenced in the Wired and Gizmodo articles, as well as what others on this thread have provided publicly.

"Dr. Wright's various posts, emails, and tweets" refers only to his written word.

The difference in grammar and tone between Satoshi's writing and Dr. Wright's various posts, emails, and tweets is interesting. Satoshi is calm and passionate, while Wright is passionate but also more than a bit scattered. If they are the same person, then Wright's personal communication style and his pseudonym's communication style have a weird (though maybe necessary?) disconnect.
