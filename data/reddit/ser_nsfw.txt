Point by point:


This is flat out false, people who hold also spend, it's never a case where someone will *always* hold* or *always* sell.
Edit: I think I've heard of some people buying Bitcoin and purposefully burning it so there's less to go around or something like that...joke's on them because whatever Bitcoin is lost makes the rest more valuable. Limited Supply 101.


Completely irrelevant - you can buy any dollar amount you wish - $1, $5, $20, it's up to you. You do not need to buy a full Bitcoin to get started.


For a lot of people, Bitcoin is fine existing as an alternative to fiat, it doesn't need to make anyone a millionaire overnight to work effectively.


Humblebrag much? This "fact" has absolutely no bearing on your argument, a person's buy-in point is completely subjective and in most cases depends on their own financial standing rather than the Bitcoin market's.


This simply isn't true, as evidenced by the Bitcoin community's work to date. Not everyone is a developer, but not everyone needs to be. Stop grouping everyone together into the same demographic, it's bad logic and as a result, you form bad arguments.


Maybe in some cases, and that isn't even a bad thing. The more people learn about Bitcoin, the easier it is to move away from fiat...education and discussion is what's needed, not sweeping generalizations about how Bitcoin will fail. People with any shred of intelligence will see Bitcoin (the entire system, not just the price point) as a step up from fiat.
 You're salty, go rinse off.

TLDR: No, Bitcoin exists solely in the differences between addresses in the public ledger. There is no such thing as a physical or “whole” Bitcoin, except if you own the private keys to a combined 1.0 BTC, and it’s displayed as a whole Bitcoin in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:10
Ok, so yes, you're referring to forking away from Bitcoin in an attempt to siphon wealth out of its market, but done by a community instead of an individual?
That's exactly what BCash and other Bitcoin forks have attempted to do, but from a hostile takeover standpoint, and it simply doesn't work. They're inherently different than Bitcoin, therefore they are *not* Bitcoin and do not affect it directly. 
Forked chains' success/failure does not mean anything in terms of Bitcoin's success/failure. Each project needs to survive on its own merit, not on what its fans have to say about it. Bitcoin does this, forked takeover attempts do not.
If a fork is to replace Bitcoin, it will be because the Bitcoin community agrees to make the switch, not because some loser gets greedy. This is why Bitcoin is superior to traditional financial systems at all.

You are referring to a fork, which renders the new chain different from the original, leaving the original technically unaffected.

An open source project is still subject to outside influences. Bitcoin isn’t going to die, the worst that will happen is the value will dip and the recover over time. It’s a deflationary currency, it grows over time by nature. 
Bitcoin also isn’t the only “correct” cryptocurrency, because it can’t fill every niche simultaneously...it simply can’t. I recommend Bitcoin as a store of value and other projects for other purposes...BAT for paying content producers, Litecoin for relatively small purchases, etc.
Find projects that suit your lifestyle and support them - cryptocurrency isn’t about making a quick buck, it’s about reforming our economy such that people can truly manage their own finances, without needing to rely on a profiteering middle-man.
Well, unless you’re Ripple.

It seems like you're trying to turn this against OP because you personally feel disgusted, instead of simply letting them know you think it's kind of creepy and leaving it at that...that's really all you needed to do to get your point across. You went 100% defensive over something that has absolutely nothing to do with you. 
Maybe you're seeing this post as evidence that someone could potentially spy on one of *your* addresses, I have no clue. 
But *you're* the one trying to vilify OP's actions from your own personal perspective, and act high and mighty while doing it...like you're somehow morally superior to OP? I dunno, that's how it seems, just remember that you're no better or worse than anyone.

I point out that the asset is a block in *A* blockchain, not necessarily the Bitcoin blockchain.


True, you can clone a blockchain, but that doesn't draw wealth away from the original by default. Anyone running a full Bitcoin node has a clone of the blockchain on their computer that they use to further diversify the Bitcoin network, further securing the original blockchain. No extra blocks are generated. To generate entirely new wealth, you need a new blockchain, ie: a new currency.


It is within a project, and that's all it needs. There is a limited number of Bitcoin...forking Bitcoin does not add to the total number of Bitcoin that can be generated. The only thing you can do is change your forked chain slightly so it takes advantage of Bitcoin's progress to date, then build on that progress...but you're still heading in a different direction from Bitcoin, so Bitcoin is not affected by your fork. It's quite literally like a fork in the road...follow one path, you can't follow another unless you have a second body/coin/currency.
If Bitcoin has a limited supply, it is deflationary. This will not change due to any kind of fork, unless the community at large agrees to make the change. Community consensus.
I'm still waking up so I may have missed a point or jumbled others, let me know if anything I said wasn't clear and I'll try to clarify.

I haven't noticed the discussion leaning 100% in either direction, I think it comes down to the individual. That being said, there's a lot of greed in play and you really just need to figure out what's best for you. If you can't afford to buy right now, that's totally fine. IMO there's never going to be a "bad" time to buy in.
Most knee-jerk reactions to a huge price rise is to celebrate or buy, which is probably the majority of what you're seeing. Alternatively, people who have been following Bitcoin for a while have started to notice that the price tends to dip right after a rally.
IMO, the people that are urging you to buy are the ones with open sell orders who are looking to make a profit off the rise in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:53:08
If you don't control your private keys then you have Coinbase's promise that you own whatever they say you do. You may not have access to your balance should their website/app go down for maintenance, so if you want full control over your Bitcoin consider moving them to Electrum, because you will actually own the private keys associated with your balance.
Best practice IMO: Use Coinbase to buy/sell because they're insured, otherwise store your balance in a wallet you control.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:26:22
Miners run their hardware to process the blockchain, generating Bitcoin in the process. The Bitcoin exists only as differences between addresses in the global ledger - when you buy Bitcoin you're not actually storing a Bitcoin somewhere, you're just buying a ledger difference in your favor. 
Miners post the Bitcoin they generate to exchanges in hopes of selling it to users for fiat.
Those users can then buy Bitcoin from an exchange, or from another user, or directly from a miner if they have the hookup.
It's like an economy or something.

Download a mobile wallet (iOS: Breadwallet, Android: Electrum), and see if there's a Bitcoin ATM near you: coinatmradar.com
Most, if not all Bitcoin ATMs accept cash at rates comparable to Coinbase (after you take convenience into consideration). The one I go to scans the QR code directly from the wallet's "Receive" tab, I just have to verify the address is correct before confirming :)
This method is my favorite because it's quick and you definitely have control of your Bitcoin in your mobile wallet when the purchase is done.

Coinbase is essentially switching their primary support from Bitcoin to BCash, solely because Coinbase and Bitmain/Roger Ver are all part of the New York Agreement, which was a corporate takeover attempt of Bitcoin development.
Long story short, Coinbase is untrustworthy, try to find a [local Bitcoin ATM]( or find another exchange. A popular P2P exchange is Bisq (formerly BitSquare).

There's a Bitcoin ATM near me that's SegWit-activated so I tend to use that - it doesn't require ID below $500 purchases and the fees are comparable to Coinbase IMO, and it takes cash which is a *huge* plus.

Bitcoin's value is determined by how much people are willing to pay for it, so if you see the price jumping from $12k to $15k overnight, it's probably not backed by any kind of fact or event, so you can probably expect the price to come down in the next week or two.
Of course there are always exceptions! If you look at the all time charts for Bitcoin you'll see a few relatively large jumps before "crashing" back to a value that's close to what it was before, but still higher. 
I think of it as a speed bump on an uphill road.

Sorry, I can't tell if you're correcting me, agreeing with me, or making an entirely different point than I was trying to make?
Bitcoin is code, yes, but Bitcoin is not about to be forgotten any time soon. 
Bitcoin is deflationary.
By nature, deflationary currencies rise, unless something happens to prevent that. That is why inflationary currencies drop in value over time, like the USD.
Limited supply is really all that's needed to make sure a currency grows in value over time, everything else can change, but if supply is limited it sets the total value of a currency much more effectively than just speculation.
I wou8ld ask what you think drives the value of USD, if not pure speculation?

Hey, just noticed you're using the baseless "cup of coffee" argument...even though Bitcoin is not currently suitable for buying cups of coffee, *and hasn't been for at least 6 months*. Lightning Network + SegWit will make this possible, but it's still in early adoption stages.
Where have you been the last few months? If you're a long term Bitcoin supporter, all of your arguments are moot. I'm guessing you're a troll/shill? 
Please clarify your position.
Edit: For the record, I'm calling out the coffe argument because it doesn't make sense. People seem to want to try and use Bitcoin for purposes it isn't well-suited for, and 5-10 minutes of personal research would tell them everything they'd need to know.

BCash shills are absolutely a danger to Bitcoin adoption, because one of BCash's main motives is hijacking the Bitcoin brand name - they deliberately confuse newcomers, which is absolutely a danger to Bitcoin adoption.
What you're describing is, I agree, a problem for Bitcoin adoption - militant geeks who don't get outside enough. 
I find OP's entire post fishy, given they've apparently been around for a while, yet use a common BCash shill argument to spread FUD. The coffee argument is crap, and if OP actually wants to know what people are using Bitcoin for, why are they listing off reason after reason why Bitcoin is hard to use, as if those reasons are the common experience? I have no problem using Bitcoin because I don't try to buy coffee with it. Omg mind blown.

Kind of confused as to what you're trying to say - do you agree that Coinbase is not the "best"/only viable option, or do you feel that Coinbase is the only true place to buy Bitcoin? My only point was that Coinbase isn't the "best" because "best" is a subjective term, and that there are other alternatives that work just as well...it seems as though others disagree vehemently with me on this.
I say there are potentially better alternatives to Coinbase...you can read how everyone has responded. My concern is that a company takes administrative action without telling the selected customer why. That isn't okay, that's straight up shady business practice, and while you, me, and many others haven't experienced it yet, the fact that Coinbase does it *at all* is enough to make me speak out in support for alternatives.

While nobody knows for sure how the value will change, I think now is a good time to break out of the "sell Bitcoin for fiat" habit. I was going back and forth on visiting the Bitcoin ATM near me just because of the erratic value last week...I went and bought some BTC when the price was just below $1,100 and I've already made a slight return on it. 
I only use Bitcoin to make random purchases online, like game time for EVE, or Amazon purchases. I never sell for fiat, pretty much hold and spend when needed. Since you have a decent chunk of BTC I'd say hold onto it and see how the value changes over the coming months. If you spend it all now you'll probably regret it all over again haha :)

I know what you're saying, but I disagree. I see Coinbase complaints posted in this sub like every day, and while the majority of Coinbase users don't have issues, that doesn't mean that issues aren't happening, much less that they should be ignored for the sake of convenience - the fact that Coinbase randomly closes accounts and cancels orders *at all* is enough to make me never want to use them.
There's no way to tell what leads them to make those decisions, and even if they offered reasons for screwing their customers, there are still services like Gemini or BitSquare that don't screw their customers in the first place - as far as we've seen, anyways...I'm not about to claim any one method will always be superior to any other method.

Agreed, but people will always want sparkly things, that's the only reason gold's worth anything in the first place. If Bitcoin can be used offline, it's better than gold in every way IMO.
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:19:38
Bitcoin can also be stored on paper wallets, much much more convenient than securing and splitting up a bar of gold, and then spending that sliver of gold as-is.
In the event of a nuclear disaster or something, where technology is rendered useless, *then* gold will probably reign supreme. But until then it seems that Bitcoin's got it beat every which way.

Wait, okay, you're taking my comment way too seriously, so let's back up, take a sip of coffee, and chill.
I've been under impression that quantum computers exist because D-Wave makes them. If they are still totally theoretical, then my mistake, but since Google and NASA both bought one, I feel like they're at least in the experimental stage. They do exist, but they aren't available to the average consumer.
My "logic" was a snarky joke of sorts - since they're very expensive and rare, to the average consumer they practically don't exist except from what they read or see from media.
You've accepted the premise that quantum computers exist by your own comment:


So what are we arguing about? Are you just trying to shit on someone this morning?

Don't worry, everyone intelligent person on this flat Earth knows that Bitcoin is crashing for good this time!

@_date: 2017-02-24 18:59:58
I don't know why people keep saying Coinbase is "the best". It may be the most convenient, but look what you have to sacrifice for it. It doesn't hurt to look up any nearby bitcoin atms, or explore alternatives like Gemini or Bitsquare. Be smart with your financial security, people.
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:09:31
Me neither, but if you can afford to lose it then you're fine. You control your money, not the other way around.
Either way, don't spend anything on Bitcoin that you can't afford to lose in the first place. If you then go ahead and give your BTC to some random website claiming to give you profits, you deserve to lose your BTC and learn a hard lesson...this is the same as winning the lottery and spending all your winnings on more lottery tickets, except the website doesn't do things according to fair play and chance (though many may argue that neither does the lottery).
Thankfully, you came here and asked for community input first, so you dodged a bullet. Bitcoin, at its core, is about financial independence and personal responsibility, among other things. IF you're not willing to practice either of those, what's the point of using Bitcoin apart from as a get-rich-quick scheme, which it is definitely not.
Yea at the end of the day, buy and hodl, and be patient. At least IMO.

Erm, well I'm basing my comments on the daily reports of user issues with Coinbase closing their account or cancelling their buy orders, so if you like dismissing evidence then by all means, keep spouting off your delusional bs. 
It's not like thousands of people chose to have their Bitcoin experience interrupted without warning, and those people weren't even given a reason as to why action was taken against their account.
No business is perfect, so if people don't like Coinbase, there are alternatives that work just as well. I never personally had an issue with Coinbase, but I'm not about to give them a chance and continue giving them money to act like this.
For a subreddit full of Bitcoiners, there sure is little love for having an alternative plan or two in place. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:46:00
I don't know how you missed the main two concerns: 
 - seemingly arbitrary closing of accounts
- cancelled orders
You don't worry about either of these with a Bitcoin ATM or BitSquare (depending on your payment method, etc).
I'm honestly shocked so many people in seem to disagree with my mentality of "having alternatives is a good thing".
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:01:08
Do not invest anything you can't afford to lose, and it doesn't matter whether it rises or drops. It's nice when it rises, but since you can afford to lose your initial investment and you can't spend any Bitcoin you don't have, you don't lose anything when it drops.

If there's a cashless society, chances are it'll be brought on by banks first, using microchips to keep track of every human's "profile".

IF you're talking about "wealth", then yes: 


But you're talking about capitalism and then applying its definition to the word "wealth".
"Wealth" does not equal "capitalism", and vice versa. Please refer to the dictionary definition I copied for your benefit.
I'm just trying to be clear, I know I can come off as a dick sometimes. I'm not mad or whatever, just trying to make sure you understand what these words actually mean, and how you're using them incorrectly.

This is subjective as well - I would argue a Bitcoin ATM and a mobile wallet is the easiest way to get started...not the most secure, but the easiest. Also, ATMs don't arbitrarily cancel orders or lock accounts based off purchasing habits. IMO, Coinbase is yet another middle man that doesn't need to be involved...that isn't to say they're useless.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:18:07
Long term the price is still relatively high, I'm glad to get cheap coin when possible!

See if there's a [Bitcoin ATM]( in your area. There's one near me with a flat 5% fee ($100 buys $95 worth), which may sound high but I can buy and sell instantly, which is totally worth not having to enter all my info online and also have the convenience of buying whenever I like, during mall hours anyways.
Otherwise you can try Bitsquare - it's P2P and it's reportedly solid, it's just not a widely-used service so buy and sell orders are somewhat limited.

When do we get to put up a PSA against using Coinbase as one's main exchange? There are alternatives, it's not like Coinbase is the be-all, end-all solution and must be dealt with.

I'll have to go back and read my posts, but I'm pretty certain I didn't...my goal was to offer alternatives, not replacements.
Again, as stated numerous times in all the parent comments: "good", "best"...these are purely subjective terms. What I consider "good" or "best" may not be what *you* consider "good" or "best", and vice versa.
Therefore, when you come here saying I'm wrong because your definition of "good" doesn't match mine, I gotta sit back and wonder who's talking out their ass and who isn't.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:55:49
There's the dictionary definition of "capitalism":

Bank of America sent me a notice on a Friday afternoon (~6pm is when it came in) that my debit card account was overdrawn, and that I had 24 hours to fix it. I immediately electronically transferred enough funds to cover the overdraft, but because I did so after business hours on Friday, the transfer didn't go through till Monday.
Because of this tiny glitch between overdraft protocol and "business hours", I was hit with overdraft fees for Saturday AND Sunday, and decided I'd had enough of their "assistance" in managing my money. 
On Monday I called them and talked to the support person until they waived the fees and I closed my account right after. Never looked back.

People need to learn to think for themselves, instead of becoming sheep to people with larger, louder personalities. The only thing that Ver or any other big name in Bitcoin (or anywhere really) has is publicity - they put out tweets that split the community, then rake in the attention as people turn to them for the next sensational quip or flash of "insight". People then react to aspects of themselves they see reflected in this "talking head" personality, and an emotional attachment is made - now the talking head is responsible for some aspect of the reader's state of mind, and only a blatant conflict of personality can break the connection. At least how I see it.
Decide what you want and follow your heart/gut/whatever - just take some goddamned responsibility for yourself.

Coinbase is fine if you're not keeping your BTC on-site as a storage option.

Thank you for the succinct breakdown! I'm torn because cell phones are very convenient but they also cost a lot more than money. I'd love a clamshell phone with a physical keypad again but I assume those are probably even less secure.
I don't use my phone for anything illegal/malicious AFAIK, so it's not a huge concern, but I do value my privacy and do not feel that a company has the right to obtain and sell user data at will, just because the person is using a device that company supports. It's a jump in logic that doesn't make sense outside profiteering or spying, to me anyways.

You should only invest what you can afford to lose. If you will be putting yourself in financial jeopardy by risking your BTC's value, sell it now and buy later when you have some wiggle room.
This is advice you should *always* follow when it comes to Bitcoin, and not just in times of a slight price slump. BTC's value seems inherently variable - if you can't handle a change of $40 after the price just broke its all-time high, you may want to hold off on getting into Bitcoin.

Armory is a good wallet for long term storage you don't plan on touching for long periods of time.
Electrum is great for convenience and security because it gives you direct access to your private keys (i.e.: "passwords" for every address you use). 
Most wallets solutions rely on seeds to restore your addresses, but if you control your private keys you can restore whatever address you own to whatever wallet service you want, total flexibility.
Bitcoin isn't going away anytime soon, despite all the recent (intentional) drama. It's a coin that stands on its own merits and has replaced USD as the standard when trading cryptocurrencies, at least in my mind. The best advice is to hold your balance for long periods of time, but if you want to trade some of it around there are exchanges like Bitfinex or Bittrex that make altcoin trading very easy.
Do some research in and for the love of god stay out of "us vs them" arguments in any crypto subreddit, they're always pure drama with no bearing on any coin being "discussed".

When a wallet is created it doesn't have any previous record in the Blockchain, so unless someone was trying to hard fork really inefficiently, no, there's no way to simply create Bitcoin out of thin air. Electricity goes into Bitcoin production, which costs money, so it isn't some magic token that's created out of nothing. If owning a ton of Bitcoin were as simple as creating a wallet with an arbitrary amount of money in it, A: we'd all have done it by now, B: there'd be no way to judge the value of BTC, it'd be worthless, and C: Bitcoin would be no different than fiat.
The fact that Bitcoin *isn't* arbitrary like fiat is what is so attractive about it. It can't be easily manipulated to suit the desires of a few at the expense of the many.

You could see if there's a Bitcoin ATM near you: 
Every machine is different, but to give some perspective the one I go to charges ~5% buy/sell fee (currently at 5.5% to buy), takes cash, and doesn't require any ID if you purchase below $500 worth.
If there aren't any near you, try LocalBitcoins: 
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:04:35
So what about your bank, are they connected in any way to your PayPal account? If so, do we have any guarantee that you won't contact your bank about cancelling a charge?

Since you're on Windows, try clicking Print... and choose the option that's something like XMS...I haven't done it in a while but one printer option basically "prints" the information to a digital version, kind of like printing it out then scanning it back in.

There's no question of whether or not Bitcoin will survive...it obviously will, the only thing that would shut down Bitcoin entirely would be 100% abandonment.

@_date: 2017-01-07 16:20:27
How long have you been into Bitcoin? This "crash" isn't a crash. BTC will always be around because it's just better than money, a crash won't kill it. I may hold off to see if the price goes any lower, but I'm definitely in "buy" mode, not "sell/spend". 
To be fair I've been into Bitcoin since around 2014, I'm not super rich off it, but I haven't lost a single cent due to "crashes". I also only use BTC to buy good online, but am looking into paying bills with it. 
BTC isn't dead lol. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:50:29
I'm sure some of them have a tiny bit of BTC just to see how it does, you'd have to be a moron to ignore BTC for the sake of social status that the 1% imposed on us in the first place. They may be psychopaths, but they're not stupid.

@_date: 2017-01-20 07:12:13
I believe you only report taxes if you sell Bitcoin, not for buying Bitcoin, since it's a commodity. If you accept payment for a commodity you have to pay tax on it.
I'm not sure how Bitcoin purchases work, since it's legally barter, IIRC.

@_date: 2017-08-27 21:13:13
Yea, the point you're missing over and over again is that Bitcoin isn't about exclusion...39% of the companies that have signed up on that one website is *not* the majority of the Bitcoin community, and I doubt many people will want to make a change that isn't required, just because some companies told them to. The fact that BitPay tried to secretly make people switch to the 2x chain, without telling them the implications, is extremely telling of the entire situation.
You're arguing against the community, plain and simple. You can throw meaningless numbers around out of context all you like,but at the end of the day, if you're against the community, you're against Bitcoin. We're all trying to work together, and "segwit2xers" such as yourself are only around because you're impatient.
That's literally all this comes down to...patience vs greed. What side of the spectrum do you tend to lean towards? (my bet is greed)
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:21:36
Because drama occurs in every group of humans, no matter the circumstance.
There will never be 100% consensus, and to see the forked Bitcoin crowd try to start drama tells me that they don't have a currency that can stand on its own. Otherwise they'd stfu and let their coin do the talking, like everything else in life.

I doubt it, Armory is super secure in general so try creating a different type of backup and using the Snipping Tool to take a screenshot of the sensitive info.
I used to use Armory but honestly if you're a regular user it's like using a flamethrower to blow out the candles on a birthday cake haha.
I use Electrum, it's way simpler and gives you direct access to your private keys.
If you get an Armory wallet set up and backed up successfully, use it for long term storage and nothing else, it's not convenient at all, but that's probably what you're after, right?

You're assuming their future *in*action based on their current inaction? Logical fallacy alert.
Probably because there's no need to develop it right now, or at the very least publicly acknowledge the need for it...simply because there's no need for larger block sizes yet. It's like demanding that the Core devs need to publicly acknowledge the fact that Bitcoin isn't 100% anonymous...there's no point because it's not an issue, and if you really want to be anonymous there are altcoins that do that.
I'm not picking any side - I'm playing the patient observer who calls them like he sees them. You're the one referring to yourself as a "segwit2xer"...
Go ahead and rush the block size increase, I have no doubt Bitcoin will be following suit in the future *when it's needed.*
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:34:04

Your post is 100% drama nonsense ("How the Grinch Stole Christmas"...in and I'm calling you out for sinking to their level of making posts solely aimed at making another community look bad. 
If I were telling you how to behave in your daily life, yea I'd be giving a sermon. But I'm telling you a basic facet of human social interaction that every adult learns after high school.
IDGAF what you're about as long as you can make a sound argument to back up your position, but you haven't done anything remotely close to that. If you like starting/continuing drama, more power to you, but it's not what this subreddit needs.
This is all IMO by the way, you don't have to take anything I'm saying as legit criticism, I'm just text on a screen to you. It just *really* helps if both sets of text can agree that "continuing drama is worse than ending it when possible". You're doing the exact opposite of ending it, so IMO it's not what this community needs, so I spoke up.

I'm assuming some form of on-chain compression is possible. From what I've heard, the Lightning Network uses "payment channels" to organize and streamline high numbers of transactions, but I do not know all the details of how the Lightning Network works, so you should go read some unbiased information on it before coming to any conclusions based off what I've said.
Miners may lose some profit, that's always a possibility even without the Lightning Network. Thankfully, not all miners are greedy nitwits.

@_date: 2017-08-10 14:14:20
Yup, that's what I'm suggesting you do. Find a better rate via another crypto and either use that other coin as a means of storage, or sell to USD, making use of the better rate. If you try this out let us know how it works because it'd be really cool to have a workaround for ridiculously high exchange rates.
Edit: Unless Changelly just has high USD rates across the board, in which case I'd use them solely for exchanging crypto - crypto.

Which ones in particular? IIRC Bitcoin is a community-driven project, whoever wants to create a block size BIP for Bitcoin is free to do so. I'm not about to assume that the most well-known/active devs aren't prepared to increase block sizes...I think they're doing the smart thing and waiting. The 2x agreement is getting ahead of itself. Everything that's trying to fork off and be "better" than Bitcoin is getting ahead of itself.
The whole point is evolution of the project over time, IMO. That's the inherent value...community ownership solely because the community feels strong and values one another. Look at all the FUD attacks aimed at weakening faith in one another. Think of how much better that energy could be spend if directed towards cooperation. 
Who stands to gain from 2x FUD?
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:24:30


POL that Assange himself considers strong/valid/whatever - he admitted that his gesture was a weak proof but it's a proof nonetheless. I'd like to see some form of proof that can't be tampered with by governmental agencies, and so far that hasn't been provided. I thought this is the kind of proof we were all looking for, not just a video and some audio and some easily-obtainable current info.
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:16:45
Ok, because you got the USD price wrong in your original post!
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:04:15
Oh I totally agree, we don't need Assange the human being, we just need a figurehead to give Wikileaks a human face. At the end of the day, I don't care too much about this situation outside a conceptual point of view. I'm not physically invested or at danger from any of this, so my points are mainly to cover the concepts of what we're experiencing - ie: corruption taking on many forms that may seem friendly but aren't, misplaced trust...the root of it all is the individual. I'm spending my time trying to be a better person to myself and those around me, I figure good things will come of it. 
IMO Wikileaks/Russia/whatever is just the flavor of the month. Unless someone's at my door trying to force me to do something, I could care less. I think people are realizing that the narrative isn't actually true, and that Wikileaks is just another part of the narrative.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:08:45

The way I see Bitcoin is as a coin that can grow incrementally, without making too large a gamble at any one step. The fact that it's community-driven stands out - it feels more human and unpredictable than other coins, but that is why I like it. For the most part it's immune to any kind of takeover, unless the community wants things to go that way. This is why I think the forked community is trying so hard to create confusion, because their community goes in whatever direction the big mining corporations want it to go, and while that may be more predictable, it's hardly more practical, or beneficial to any community.
We're moving away from banks/financial institutions for a reason. Forked Bitcoin seems to backtrack no matter what, while claiming "progress" or "superiority" the whole time, and trying to steal a name that's already in use, let's not forget that hilarious tidbit.

Why *wouldn't* they include replay protection if they easily can?
Attempted corporate takeover of community-centric currency, IMO. It'll fail tremendously solely because it's corporate-centric instead of community-centric, and I'm having fun rebutting every stupid pro-forked argument with basic common sense.

Well the hard truth is that you only have yourself to blame. Nobody forced you to buy as the price was dropping, and if you check the long-term charts you'll see the overall trend is in an upwards motion. That's not a guarantee, but you can probably assume that any dip you've seen over the last week are temporary and will eventually stabilize or rise again.

Other solutions can be implemented with actual community consensus, we do not need corporations making big decisions without taking community input into account, while also trying to throw their weight around to intimidate any community, let alone Bitcoin.
That's why we're all using crypto instead of fiat in the first place, *remember*?

It should be assumed that not every person is always moral, either. People fall somewhere on a spectrum of morality at any given time, but their location on that spectrum can change depending on any number of factors.
That's why drama is so pointless, IMO. It's usually all short-sighted reactions to immediate "problems", very little thinking-through going on.

The chain followed by Bitcoin Core - the full node Core wallet can be downloaded from Bitcoin.org.

If you manage your Bitcoin holdings efficiently, like a responsible user of currency, yes. 
More inputs = higher fee. If your transaction is sourced from a single input, the fee will be lower than if your transaction is sourced from 5 inputs.
Edit: inputs*, not addresses, thanks for correcting me!

I'd call it a blip. You don't need to go through Coinbase, there are alternatives that may be slightly less convenient or slightly more expensive, but you are not forced to go through Coinbase. 
Personally, I was using Circle up until they stopped being an exchange, so I installed BitSquare as a workaround till something better came along. I got lucky and literally happened across a Bitcoin ATM in the mall near me so that's most likely going to be my first choice from now on.
Coinbase is not the definition of Bitcoin, nor the entity that determines its value. If the community doesn't want Coinbase, they will fail or change to something else. Seems to me like Coinbase doesn't want the BTC community so I can't see why people haven't started looking for alternatives while things are still calm. Set up your safety nets now, not when it's too late.

That sounds an awful lot like a challenge...you must clearly be focused on cooperation amongst the community.
The point is: you aren't right solely because they haven't done anything *yet*. Your standpoint makes no logical sense. You're talking tough and making these declarations, but it's all for naught, because you're not making any sense.
Based on the words you've chosen to use, you're apparently more invested in a contentious fork than you are in finding an actual solution that works for everyone. Go have fun, nobody is trying to stop you, you're free to do whatever you want - that's the beauty of it. 
The fact is, the majority of the Bitcoin community doesn't want to rush a decision that doesn't need to be made. The 2x fork is centered around the desires of corporations, not the interests of the community. Are you sure you know what side you're on? Because you're definitely arguing against the community on this one...

You can use individual addresses out of the Receive tab as often as you want, and I think as soon as one address has a confirmed balance you can generate a New address using the button.
Ideally, never use cloud mining services, they're usually scams. Get your money out ASAP and just buy some Bitcoin, or mine with NiceHash if you're using a GPU in your PC. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:58:57

Gotta ask - are you consolidating inputs?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:06:48
I'm not familiar with condensing inputs, maybe it would be cheaper to send from each address with a balance individually, instead of trying to send from all of them at once? No clue.
As for getting access to your BCH, once you've figure out how to move your Bitcoin balance from btcWallet1 to btcWallet2, all you do is restore btcWallet1 to Electron Cash. Your Bitcoin are safely stored in btcWallet2, and since the BCH chain never saw any outgoing transaction from btcWallet1, your ghostBTC/BCH is still stored in btcWallet1 ready for spending on BCH chain.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:57:31
I didn't mention any other services.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:14:24
You understand that every single miner in the world can choose what chain to mine, correct? So obviously if Bitcoin is still processing blocks, Bitcoin has miners that want to stick around. I'd be running NiceHash 24/7 if I didn't also want to play video games, but I don't know if that counts as "mining" haha.
Saying "we can't trust miners", referring to any single person who has and ever will mine Bitcoin, casts a shadow over miners everywhere, and taints readers' perception of them. 
Sorry not "them"..."us".
Bitcoin isn't about putting any particular group of people in their place, it's about working together as a community, pooling together all our resources to make Bitcoin stand out. So far that's worked, and every attempt to move away from this model has always been initiated by corporate interests who stand to make money on whatever hair-brained centralized scheme is decided upon.
This means not vilifying the miners that support Bitcoin, just because they happen to be "miners".
IMO anyways.

As far as I understand it, the only thing 2x adds that SegWit doesn't is a larger block size, which is what the corporate-backed Bitcoin fork provides, right? Bitcoin can always add larger block sizes down the road if needed, but it's better to upgrade in steps than all at once.
So I guess to me it seems that the only reason someone would support 2x is either out of financial greed or because they think rushing things is the way to go...not the community's well-being.

I think you should try to think of it as a world economy based on cryptocurrencies. Some other coins are inflationary, some are designed for eGovernance, others are designed for the Internet of Things. 
It won't just be Bitcoin, and I doubt that Bitcoin will be the main currency, but only because I have no clue how versatile Bitcoin can actually be. I know that it can't be inflationary AND deflationary at the same time, at least not yet haha, but I fully expect people to have to manage multiple currencies/coins/tokens by the time the global economy is crypto-based.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:22:13
I don't blame you, in the crypto world my leniency meter has shrunk way down haha. I just started using Bitfinex and while I haven't set myself up to trade USD, it's very handy for exchanging between cryptos while giving you the price in USD as well, so you know where you stand. I sent my BCH there and converted it to IOTA, then used some of that to buy BTC, then just bought some OMG today with some of that Bitcoin. I have three different wallets and it gives me a total balance in USD, which is really nice.
Edit: The crypto selection on Bitfinex is kind of limited, so I also have an account on Bittrex just in case.

The way I see it, Bitcoin *can* adapt to handle growth, but there currently isn't a pressing need for it. 
The difference is that the forked Bitcoin is run solely by corporations...it actually *is* centralized around large mining companies. 
Bitcoin is run by a group of developers whose members can change whenever - it isn't tied to any group of businesses or users or miners or whatever...whoever wants to use it can use it, and they can use it however they want.
The nature of Bitcoin is to be decentralized and upgrade as the community majority sees fit, yet the forked crowd thinks the nature of Bitcoin is to be centralized, just with large blocks. They ignore that Bitcoin can change outside the whims of corporate interests who stand to profit from whatever changes are made...as is the case with the forked Bitcoin.
Sure, hold some forked Bitcoin to try and make a quick buck, but outside that it has very little real-world value when compared to Bitcoin. I'm sure both will survive, but Bitcoin will always come out ahead simply by its decentralized nature. 
IMO anyways.

I can kind of see a situation where this might be used:
So imagine employees are helping customers from their computer - IT support, whatever. They get paid by the customer directly as subcontractors/their own entity, while still being employed by is a new business owner. This is their first business and they want to micromanage every aspect of their budding money machine, and they think they'll try the "full-on Bitcoin" route. They've got multiple wallets in multiple flash drives, each password-protected and kept in a shoebox in the closet. But one computer has all the wallets imported so has full control over the finances - they should, they're the boss after all. They can move each employee's earnings to a main wallet at intervals throughout the day, then pay each employee out at the end of the day.
Or some other bullshit, I dunno...this is a shitty idea if you're involving other people and their rightfully earned money. Don't do it.

Before the fork my Electrum BTC wallet was normal. After the fork was verified, I downloaded Electron Cash to my laptop that has never had Electrum installed to it (because of the reports that Electron Cash uses the same data directory as Electrum). 
I went through the install process just like Electrum, but before sending any coins anywhere be sure to switch chains in the Network settings panel. There are two branches, pick the one with the "jihan"-related URL. Otherwise, Electron Cash will keep looking at the Bitcoin block chain.
After the fork as Electron Cash was installing, I created a new Electrum wallet on my PC and sent my BTC from btcWallet1 to btcWallet2. Once Electron Cash was finished, I restored btcWallet1 into it using the recovery seed. As long as you've switched to the proper chain, your balance will appear in BCH. Electron Cash's website walks you through how to change which chain your client follows, but it's slightly out of date (includes nonexistent URLs), so I just picked the chain that had anything to do with "jihan" and "abc".

Because your entire post/argument is founded on the assumption that the forked Bitcoin community, as a whole, is somehow making people in the bitcoin community, individually, feel attacked.
If there are only a handful of bad actors in the forked community, specify that instead of grouping them in with the rest of their community. 
"Us (as individuals) vs Them (as a collective)" is the only logical outcome of your post based on the words you've chosen to use, and you're clearly intelligent enough to form a coherent argument, so I'm curious as to your word choice and use of rhetoric.
IMO your post does not encourage cooperation, which is why I'm asking what you personally consider a "good" or "bad" actor.

I don't know enough about Bitcoin to make seriously declarative statements, but I do know that unless the majority of the community *as a whole* agrees on a direction, Bitcoin should wait to move in said direction. That's what community consensus is.
The 2x fork is not based on community consensus, AFAIK, because it's still so far out and everything being said about it is essentially priming for the future debate.

I guess I've always been under the impression that the actual invention was the blockchain technology. Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency could fail, though since it's the original "coin" and can be updated as needed, I doubt it'll ever fade out in favor of another cryptocurrency. 
One could argue that we're not using the original version of Bitcoin anymore so it's already failed. Maybe that's the logic behind the joke "Bitcoin's died X amount of times already"...it just keeps going, regardless of whatever the USD value is when someone decides to declare it's "crashing for good".

No, because you can reverse the transaction and walk away with both the Bitcoin and your PayPal balance intact.
At this point you're simply asking strangers to trust you, so maybe look up an escrow service that would put people's minds more at ease?
Edit: Apparently Friends and Family payments aren't eligible for buyer protection, as per this help page: 
Pretty nifty, I'd still use escrow to be safe. 
Edit 2: What about the bank end of things? If PayPal won't cancel a transaction, maybe the bank will. This is why I avoid PayPal for buying Bitcoin.

I've started reading some of what they have to say in the other sub and they seem to like to think that they can simply use "Bitcoin" as the main part of their name and people will just naturally start using their currency instead of Bitcoin lol. They're literally just trying to steal the name "Bitcoin" and talk as if they want "Bitcoin" to succeed. They're just as divisive, if not more so, than people in this sub and others.
Nobody is right or wrong, it comes down to actually working together. Until people start looking past differences, unity is a pipe dream built on hype and fueled by community back-and-forth. Unity is only ever brought up when there's a debate, it seems.

I 100% agree, except for the assumption that there's a lack of community as a result of this diversity.
Comparing cryptocurrencies is like comparing apples to oranges...yea, they're both fruit, but they're still different. People can eat one of each if they want.
When people say "community", they mean "group of people working together", not "group of people choosing a single coin and sticking to it no matter what." We're talking about the cryptocurrency community as a whole...not solely the subsets that make up the Bitcoin and forked Bitcoin communities.
If someone has a valid argument, it's valid, regardless of if it comes from the Bitcoin community, the forked community, or any other cryptocurrency community.
If anyone feels "attacked" by valid arguments from the forked Bitcoin community, let them. I don't see why you're using their fear/vulnerability to further drive apart the cryptocurrency community, citing two specific subsets instead of addressing larger concepts that span both/other currencies.
Focus on cooperation, not alienation.

Yes, I'm telling you that most of the community *did not* want SegWit2x...just SegWit alone. It remains to be seen if larger block sizes are needed because SegWit hasn't been activated. The debate surrounding SegWit2x, to me, seems solely based on speculation, and is only spread by proponents of the NYA Agreement, which was *also* not community-centric. It was literally a meeting of CEOs.
I don't know what side you think you're arguing for, but it's not the community's, IMO.

I've learned to give my peers the benefit of the doubt, but to never trust those in positions of power. They put out a simple facade that never accurately depicts the actual process in motion and expect the people who notice to be okay with it and trust them. Same thing with Reddit - sure, the CEO can say all they want, but at the end of the day there's nothing stopping them from doing what they please except those in key positions who *haven't* been bought out yet. Same for any company, that's why an "official apology" never comes to mean anything of value...sometimes we never even get an apology, but businesses keep running and doing immoral shit for the sake of profit and the company's survival. The fucking definition of sellout.
Edit: I'm speaking irrationally btw, I know next to nothing about any of this, except how their perceived actions make me feel.

Let a product or service do its own advertising. If there's a problem with Bitcoin, negative reviews offer insight into what can be fixed. Flooding a review site with nothing but positive reviews makes a product/service look less authentic, IMO.

I have no clue, I'm not a miner. I do know that if the big mining companies try to leave Bitcoin, the Bitcoin difficulty should drop over time, but I don't know any of the specifics. It won't mean the end of Bitcoin though. I think they know this and are simply trying to hijack the name "Bitcoin" out of desperation, because that's the only thing that makes sense based on the info I've come across so far.
Bitcoin isn't going to die just because a few big companies are trying to throw their weight around. Also, Bitcoin is the one you can actually use in the real world...something the forked crowd seems to either forget or ignore.

This entire transaction is not 100% safe regardless of who you trust. The key is to not have to trust anyone, which is why escrow is so widely used.
Either be cool with using escrow or don't use PayPal to buy/sell Bitcoin. It's not difficult, if you're gonna try and argue your way out of using actual buyer protection for your transaction, it makes your request that much shadier.

My point is that if one coin bases its direction on community consensus (miners, users, node operators *working together*), and another coin is based solely on the whims of major mining corporations that essentially control everything about that coin, I'm picking the community-centric one...Bitcoin.
The forked Bitcoin crowd is literally trying every underhanded thing they can think of to disrupt Bitcoin, instead of letting their own coin stand up on its own merits.
Based on human behavior alone, the Bitcoin community is much more mature and level-headed.

I'm all for truth too, but if you're saying that everything's fine over at Wikileaks, I'd like to see your proof of that. I'm only noticing a difference in Wikileaks as a whole pre-raid vs post-raid, and I think that to accept anything given to us by Wikileaks should be taken with a large grain of salt, especially since nothing conclusive has been proven one way or another.
From what I understand, Assange could provide other, more definitive proof that he's actually alive, but I've already admitted I don't know what that proof might be, only that audio and video simply isn't enough.
Again, I'm sorry I don't have the answers you're looking for, but you don't need to finish a shit sandwich and a side of shit to realize halfway through that you're eating shit.

Sorry, but this is pretty explicitly one-sided against the forked Bitcoin community.


This sets the bias parameters, by explicitly labeling one group negatively and the "other" group positively. You didn't even leave anything up to the imagination, you've told people how each group should be thought of.

Before, every transaction was its own entry into the blockchain.
Now, groups of similar transactions made within a certain timeframe are all counted into one, larger transaction. 
I think of it as introducing categorization to the entire Bitcoin ledger, where all transactions for buying coffee, or that are kept under a certain amount, are lumped together to form one, larger transaction that counts in the blockchain as one (1) transaction, instead of fifty smaller transaction...but I doubt this is an efficient way of thinking of it. I'm just lazy.

Oh wait I think I'm confusing you with OP haha, sorry about that. Whatever seems aimed at "your post" should say "OP's post". Thank you for clarifying "community" vs "economy" btw, economy does make much more sense IMO.
OP used terms that designate "people who feel attacked" - individuals - and "by forked Bitcoin" - the forked community as a whole.
This wordplay is subtle and perhaps even involuntary, but they still carry a message, which is why using proper verbiage is vital in communication. Given the terms OP chose to use in their post, the post doesn't serve as anything constructive from my point of view.

You might be seeing change addresses at work, if you send an amount greater than any single address you own holds, your wallet will send out a larger amount from multiple addresses and send you back the "change".

I believe it's the same situation as with PayPal - you can technically use those services to buy/sell Bitcoin, but if those services find out they can terminate your account, even if you did nothing wrong. This means that anyone buying Bitcoin via Neteller/PayPal can initiate the transaction then cancel it after you've sent the BTC, claiming you're a scammer. PayPal/Neteller don't directly support BTC yet so they just see someone sending you money expecting something in return, and getting nothing. IE: You'll try to buy/sell BTC but will most likely get scammed, which is why Circle and other exchanges were so popular. It really sucks that Circle doesn't allow us to buy/sell anymore :/
To be clear, AFAIK PayPal/Neteller haven't explicitly said that they oppose Bitcoin, but they certainly don't take your side if things go wrong, quite the opposite.

I'd argue that Star Wars was HD and it's much easier to spot CGI in HD, I assume Assange's stream wasn't in HD? I didn't see it myself.
I guess at the end of the day, nothing was provided that guarantees Assange is actually alive...claiming that the tech "isn't as good" is lazy IMO, the tech could be decades ahead of what we're being shown and we'd never know, but it's much easier to say "well I don't see it out there now" instead of considering that our government isn't 100% truthful with us, and neither is anyone else.
I'd much rather be wary of anything Wikileaks tries to push, than blindly accept whatever they push just because "it's Wikileaks". For all we know, they're compromised. 100% trust is foolish. Assange's "proof" is crap IMO.

PSYOPS are a real thing, too. Be aware of psychological tricks that aim to distract, derail, or simply detract from any discussion. 
I.E.: If a user doesn't seem like a regular user, they probably aren't. As in, if their comment history is nothing but pro-forked Bitcoin comments, you probably shouldn't take anything they have to say at face value, or you should at least *verify* what they are saying. The FUD is strong as of late.
Be smart, folks. This isn't the 90's anymore.

TL;DR: I disagree. 
I think ~$4k is perfectly reasonable right now, for this day and age, especially given the rate at which awareness has gone up in general. A few years ago when 9/11 and the first Zeitgeist movie came out, I think that's when a lot of people started to look at themselves and their lifestyle in a different light. As more and more conflicting information comes out from every direction, people can only really trust themselves...that's how it's always been. Coupled with the bullshit big banks inherently are made of, the relatively high demand for self-secured finances seems higher than ever, and Bitcoin fits the bill perfectly. It's been around for a number of years and has relative stability - remember the USD has been consistently falling in value for decades, something else that affects the rising value of BTC - and it's actually open-source. People can actually control their own money in the digital world now, no actual need for banks. Sure, there may be big players that have certain amounts of influence, but none of these players are permanent fixtures. They don't have to be there and the network doesn't really generally care if they're there, unless they're being giant assholes and shitting all over everything.
The community aspect is another thing I've noticed...it's drawing a lot of different people into the world of fintech, similarly to how the Internet brought people into the world of computers. Finance and IT are both very important areas of knowledge for survival in the modern world, where the immense shortcomings of current systems are slowly being revealed in larger and larger scopes. Why should one group of people get to say their made-up currency has value, while another group of people's made-up currency doesn't? To me - and apparently millions of others - it seems like a double-standard and/or hypocrisy, and we're fucking done. Bitcoin is the coin the reaches the farthest back. It's the original. We've all heard about the dude who bought two pizzas for today's equivalent of something something million or whatever, that's the sort of unimportant factoid stuff that makes us all smile about how far this community has come. Whatever the drama du jour is, we can always agree that we're all headed in the same general direction - financial independence and freedom.
Apart from the value stability and community aspects, the blockchain technology is HUGE. there have been tons of new projects built on that tech that's going to drive the tech industry (and others) forward very quickly...I'm not even a pro, I'm just a layman who's seeing what's there. The technology is there, and that is what I think gives Bitcoin inherent value. It's simply the first coin, the flagship. The only difference is that this flagship is 100% modular and can be updated as needed...it won't get hung up in a museum or paraded around for the sheer novelty of it. Bitcoin is the Apollo rocket carrying Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong and the other guy, it'll be the first to take us to a completely alien place and set a sort of bar, but it never has to stop growing unless the community, as a collective single mind comprised of all the differing opinions, decides it should.
We may be in a bubble, but I don't think it's a tremendously large one. I don't think we'll hit $12k anytime soon, maybe in another 8-12 months? *Maybe?* I have no clue, I'm just looking at the all-time charts and trying to plot some sort of curve. Either way I don't think a lot of long time holders will cash out, simply because its our nature to hodl. That's like saying a fish will walk on land if there's too many sharks in the water - we'll just hodl harder, and perhaps diversify some of our hodlings to play it safe.
Quit the FUD and enjoy the ride. If it plummets, buy the dip.

I was referring more to the process of sending/receiving Bitcoin, and doesn't escrow help the trust issue? I guess there's no way to guarantee 100% trust but I feel like the way things stand now, Bitcoin's a far lot easier to use than traditional banking/financial systems. I'm wondering if that relative simplicity will be able to carry over to the userbase, or if companies will seek profit so fervently that they compromise the simplicity that makes Bitcoin so appealing in the first place. 
I suppose at the end of the day there are always workarounds, but this is kind of what I'm getting at - the lack of a reliable workaround means that companies deeply involved with Bitcoin's development can't chase after profit, they really do have to focus on what's best for the technology and sometimes forsake profits. It sounds like some companies are trying to have their cake and eat it too, which doesn't seem reasonable at this point in time.

Be sure to move any and all Bitcoin you buy on Coinbase to a wallet you actually control, or else your Bitcoin is subject to the seemingly arbitrary whims of Coinbase.
I like using CoPay for convenience, but there are much more secure options out there. Remember that unless you own the private key to an address, you don't actually own any Bitcoin stored at that address. I.E.: If you use web wallets, you don't actually own Bitcoin, the web wallet service provider does.

It's nothing but drama. 
Bitcoin is community-centric.
The forked Bitcoin is corporate-centric.
The only other difference that really stands out is block size, which can be added into Bitcoin later anyways, so IMO, the forked Bitcoin is an attempt on the miner's behalf to corporatize Bitcoin and take away everything that makes Bitcoin superior in the first place. They also tout hash rate as the deciding factor in what makes "Bitcoin", "Bitcoin"...but again they're forgetting it's up to community consensus, not just miners.
The forked Bitcoin crowd also likes to use "Bitcoin" to describe the forked coin, as if they've forgotten that you can't steal a name that's currently in use lol.
You can decide which coin you'd rather use. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:11:08
I never considered selling BTC for cash but I did use BTC to buy stuff every so often. I'd buy 0.1 at a time until I had 0.5 then I'd buy whatever. Sometimes I'll buy 0.25 or 0.5 at once, but only if I have enough cash sitting around.

@_date: 2016-12-29 14:36:57
I have a storage wallet and a spending wallet, and the spending wallet is further organized. I only move as much BTC as I'll need for a purchase, or at the very least I keep about 0.1 BTC in the spending wallet so I have an idea of how much 1 BTC is worth in USD.
Make monthly exchanges and immediately move your purchased Bitcoin to a storage wallet before deciding what to do with it. The key is controlling your BTC ASAP after purchase, and leaving your Bitcoin in a wallet you don't control undermines everything you want to do.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:55:39
Gotcha, I see what you're saying now.
I think if exchanges are the only things being hacked, that's to be expected. I don't think individual miners are being hacked...the only thing that would disrupt mining software would be if the destination address for payouts were changed, or if the type of currency being mined were changed without the software owner's knowledge...assuming that other currency is able to mined using the same settings at the miner was initialized with...otherwise the miner would crash and be useless to the hacker. Though *that* would pose for an interesting attack scenario...shutting down a mining operation by maliciously changing the miner pool target to crash all the miners until they were manually restarted.

I think it has less to do with your overall intent and more to do with your presentation. If you resubmit your post with a slightly different title, maybe: "Bitcoin is in need of reviews on Revex.co, if you have a minute please consider submitting your honest opinion!" or something along those lines. Make it about promoting Bitcoin's visibility and widespread userbase, not about Bitcoin "deserving better reviews".

That's close but it misses the core issue as I see it. Your analogy might as well be "why have Stock A when you can have stock B?" instead of "why bother with stocks at all?" You can buy every meal you ever eat and be out a shitload of money. Or you can teach yourself to cook and have more money.
The issue IMO is more to do with the technology over time and how it relates to the current financial system where quick = good. Like yea, NVIDIA's stocks might be doing well, compared to Bitcoin, at this moment, but talk to us in a year. Or 5. That person boasting about their NVIDIA stock will be singing a different tune, assuming NVIDIA doesn't become the next megacompany. Even then you can't compare them unless you throw in the USD value, which is meaningless with it comes to BTC's true worth. I guess in that light, they might as well boast about how well NVIDIA stock is doing when compared to the monetary costs of jogging...yea, you make more money, but you miss out on exercise and keeping healthy.
I guess I see the USD/BTC comparison as a comparison between a piece of paper and morality, respectively. You can't compare the two because they're inherently different things. What's better...Star Wars: Battlefield, or the infrastructure on which it operates? Clearly SW:BF because it's immediately gratifying.
That last analogy is more apt than my original one, I think.
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:27:43
I try to understand that things are rarely done "for the good of humanity" when it comes to money, but at the same time it doesn't make sense to have 100% self-serving companies. Like literally none outside its own context. I think a good part of why the global economy seems kind of precarious at the moment is because so much money has been hidden in tax havens - if that money made it back to the global economy it could actually help people on large scales, or so I would think (more allocated money for projects, etc). 
I can see "business" as a spiral down into nothingness, because that's how it seems these days. A business lives until profits can't be had, then another takes its place that *can* make those profits. At the very least we could stop pretending that this is a sustainable (or even necessary) model by hiding behind the law/regulations and projected numbers and all that. It's like the economy holds itself up without any input from consumers...they tax us already, why not tax us enough to pay for anything we need? Why bother paying us at all? 
I fucking hate finances. I love how simple Bitcoin is to use. I want that simplicity to carry over into any service a business can provide. But simple doesn't mean profit, or something? I dunno. I am layman incarnate.

The quote, bold font included from article: 


It's a perfectly valid point - business are taking advantage of open-source tech but not giving anything back except ways for them to make more money via the userbase. Businesses are not morally perfect, they are the opposite by nature IMO. Sure, they serve a useful purpose, but the fact is that those same services could be provided by smaller companies all working together, without the overarching parent company to rule them all. It's fine to have some solid businesses in place, but if they could be broken up over time to give more control of the community back to the community itself, that might be neat. A community that employs itself to keep itself running and decentralized...it *sounds* neat anyways.
Businesses trying to take advantaged of Bitcoin need to determine what's more important this early on: Profit, or the technology. Right now, the answer should always be "the technology", and if profit can be made at the same time so be it...but using Bitcoin to attain profit/riches goes against the entire concept AFAIK. The value will simply adjust. Can someone correct me? I know it's not that simple.

It seems like you're lashing out at me for even asking you to explain your reasoning.


"Call me out on it"? There's nothing to call out, don't you realize there isn't going to be *just* a single crypto that people use? One coin cannot fill every niche simultaneously AFAIK, why are you 100% against anything that isn't Bitcoin?
So to clarify what's happened so far, OP wants to tip someone, and I suggest an alternative to Bitcoin (because Bitcoin is not good for microtransactions, and IOTA is because it doesn't have transaction fees, btw). You call my suggestion a shitcoin, and when I ask you why, you go on a rant about how everything that isn't Bitcoin is a shitcoin, like some fanatic?

It's still relatively early in Bitcoin's existence, the longer it's around the more prevalent it will become. It's clearly superior to former financial systems, it just needs time.
Coinbase is fine for getting started but most people would suggest holding your own balance to remove any potential issues with using CB as a middle man. Alternatives include P2P options and Bitcoin ATMs. You can always simply accept Bitcoin as payment for goods and services!

This seems more like a "I fucked up and am feeling butthurt" kind of problem, not a "Bittrex is evil and holding my money hostage" kind of problem.
Jokes aside, from their point of view your new account is fraudulent because the original account is still active, you just can't get into it because you lost your authenticator.
Have you tried redownloading the authenticator to a new device to regain access to your account? It seems like opening a new account was entirely unnecessary but that's just me.

Yes, rbtc did that all on their own, as evidenced by their entirely separate subreddit. had no part to play in the divide except to serve as a target for bch's complaints and abuse. The majority of users chose not to participate in the back-and-forth that rbtc constantly played up. There were a few that even admonished our own members for starting drama directed at rbtc.
Members of rbtc are free to come back to under a different username if they've been banned, there's no need to "merge" two subreddits. was the original, they can come back to the original.

Of course there is - exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs, and peer-to-peer transfers are probably the only ways to do this, but there are *tons* of options!

BCash is a fork of Bitcoin that has it's development and mining entirely dictated by 2-3 individuals who happen to be millionaires and can simply throw lots of money into their project instead of putting real hard work into it. It's the opposite of "decentralized" and the epitome of a scam. 
I'm sure folks from the BCash camp will say similar things about Bitcoin. I guess for me it comes down to whether or not I'm putting money into a project that has the project's future and sustainability in mind, not just mining profits.

Dude you can send SegWit transactions with like a 0.05-0.20 cent fee, I've done it a few times but I don't move large amounts of my Bitcoin around often so it's not an issue. I use my Bitcoin as a store of value, as it's supposed to be used. 
Why not use an altcoin for buying your coffee? Bitcoin can't do everything.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:48:05


It's just that this is your subjective experience, which is commonly advised against. Bitcoin is currently not suitable for buying coffee, but that doesn't mean it's in a bad spot right now. If you plan on making transactions with small amounts, you're gonna have a bad time. Try spreading the word about altcoins like Litecoin or something, instead of bitching about how high the fee is on a $3.50 transaction.
If it's *really* a dealbreaker you could always sign up for a Bitcoin debit card, or just pay with fiat.


Again, if you were using SegWit, the fees would be much, much lower. Try using SegWit.

Imagine a road that is always the same width. Now imagine a path that branches off this road, but that doesn't take away from the width of the main road, it just goes off in another direction.
This is what 2X is. They're just going off in another direction. If they take anything, it's hashpower, but that's relative. Anyways, 2X is a pump and dump scheme (to put it simply) and the recent price hike is them trying to capitalize on the forking process.

This doesn't sound accurate...I feel like if the supply is always being pruned while new coins are added, the estimated value stays the same. This is one reason why Bitcoin stands a good chance of becoming valuable in the long run - after all the coins are mined and more coins are lost/deleted/whatever, the *diminishing supply* increases the total value of the remaining supply. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:34:04

There are people is less ideal situations that do not have access to purchase methods that you may subjectively view as illegitimate.

The idea is that you actually own the trading cards you purchase through the blockchain, but they're digital just like Bitcoin.
IMO it's a scam because the burden of setup effort is entirely on the user, while the company does nothing but collect money for nothing but another shitty TCG that *happens* to involve the blockchain in some way.

Coinbase is a 3rd party service that allows you to use their site for storage, but this means that at the end of the day, you don't actually possess your Bitcoin. It's like asking a random person off the street to be your bank. They might be trustworthy, but there's also a chance they could disappear and your money with them (MtGox).
When it comes to wallets, you land on a spectrum of convenience vs security:
 - If you want to store your Bitcoin without any interest or whatever, simply storage, go with Bitcoin Armory. You own the private keys to your wallet. It's very secure but isn't very convenient.
 - If you want to store your Bitcoin while receiving interest, and Coinbase offers that, feel free to keep your Bitcoin in Coinbase's wallet. You do not own the private keys, you are essentially renting out Coinbase's Bitcoin. When you withdraw to your wallet, Coinbase sends you the equivalent amount, not the exact same Bitcoin you've been using (at the code level). This is very convenient but isn't very secure.
There are many other storage options than just these two, shop around! Don't feel like you have to trust anyone but yourself, you really don't (at least not with Bitcoin).

It isn't the time to fork solely for a blocksize increase, but if it were then Core could implement it, no need for the NYA agreement at all...that's the whole point. The 2x agreement was in case SegWit/Lightning Network failed to do what they were designed and proven to do, and they did exactly what they're designed and proven to do...so the NYA agreement is entirely moot.

You can do the same with cash, that's my point, and cash has actual real-world value...not everyone recognizes Bitcoin. Cash is practically more valuable.
Sorry we disagree, but I'll never be dealing with you if that's how you do things. I get where you're coming from but as the sender of the Bitcoin, it's your responsibility to ensure it reaches the buyer successfully. Not everyone takes that responsibility seriously, and it's safer for any buyer of Bitcoin to hold their cash until they're sure they have it, especially if they're new to cryptocurrency in general.
Just because you don't follow best/common practice doesn't mean it's bad advice.
I know exactly what I'm talking about - we're discussing a normal transaction, not some alien concept that I can only understand if I've sold bitcoin face-to-face. This is common economics, get off your high horse lol.

You do realize JP Morgan didn't do anything illegal, right? They made a statement and since some people are sheep, they acted like JP Morgan's statement meant anything, and JP Morgan took advantage of the situation. 
If they cheated the Bitcoin community out of anything, it's our assurance that we don't give a fuck about traditional banking systems. Obviously that's not true, and even though some of us definitely didn't flinch, lots of other people did, and that shows JP Morgan that their statements can influence the Bitcoin market.
The real lesson is learning to think for yourself, instead of trying to blame someone and getting mad when justice isn't served.

"Holding" just refers to advice given to newcomers who are tempted to sell during any "crash"...it isn't universal law that the entire Bitcoin ecosystem depends on, lol.
It is possible to trade other currencies besides fiat for goods and services.
IMO we "serve each other" in the sense that both sides of any argument/debate are both sides of the same coin. Bitcoin's value is a collective result of miners, users, and holders, and everyone in between...no one group is subservient to another. If we all work together, we all succeed.

I'm confident because Bitcoin is like the Internet...it's just technology. It doesn't need to be marketed because as long as it's allowed to grow naturally, its superiority to traditional financial systems is glaringly apparent to anyone who takes time to learn anything about it.
It's exactly what money is supposed to be...P2P value transfer without one static group of humans controlling everything. It can be changed to adapt to community needs over time, as long as there's community consensus. Anyone can contribute to the project because it is open-source, and anyone can fork the project to suit their own needs...Bitcoin acts as the mothertree for a ton of cryptos out there.
I also think that Bitcoin isn't going to be the one-coin-fits-all solution, simply because it can't fill every niche at once. It works beautifully as a store of value to weigh other cryptocurrencies against, in lieu of fiat currencies, so I see it as the "banking" crypto for the time being. At any rate, every other cryptocurrency, without exception, is somewhat influenced by Bitcoin's USD value. The big hurdle will be moving away from the USD and letting the community *actually* determine Bitcoin's true value. That's the only thing I can see causing Bitcoin to fail...if the community decides it isn't worth it, or find a different store of value coin, or whatever.

It's all subjective. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:17:17
I have no clue, I'm only clarifying your initial comment.
The point of SegWit was to compromise between people who either wanted only Segwit or only a blocksize increase - 2x wanted to do both...SegWit now, 2MB block size in November. 
Except it was formulated and agreed upon *in private*, without input from the community, by CEOs of companies that ease mainstream adoption, so I'm assuming business profits are a factor in the 2x agreement as well since they're trying to draw in the very mining companies that forked Bitcoin before.
2x aims to rush a blocksize increase when there's no way to determine if it's even needed yet, because SegWit:Lightning Network haven't been fully implemented yet. If Bitcoin needs a blocksize increase, it can be added when the community recognizes the need for it. 
Right now, people are essentially trying to say our Mars colonies aren't as efficient as they could be when we haven't even landed on Mars yet, or something. It's nonsense.

Who knows? 
BCH is literally nothing but an attempted corporate takeover of the Bitcoin brand/community/social reach by a small group of mining companies. If that's who you want to support, over the community at large, by all means.
The fork only happened because the BCH community wanted to rush a blocksize increase while coincidentally giving control over the entire network to the mining companies who proposed the fork. They gained support through disinformation, FUD, and paid shill campaigns aimed at confusion and disagreement among the Bitcoin community to the point where people chose BCH because they simply didn't know what to think anymore, and wanted to play it safe. 
Bitcoin did *not* want to rush a blocksize increase, because SegWit had been locked in and simply hadn't been activated yet - BCH supporters cited the lack of change as Bitcoin's inherent failure, despite it only being a matter of time, not function. Bitcoin was always open to increasing the blocksize *if it needed to be increased after SegWit+Lightning Network*, which so far it hasn't been. If it needs to be, it can be and most likely will be if a better solution isn't found first. 
It's whatever the community agrees upon...not what mining companies force upon the community.
The way I see it, BCH is now an outdated, corrupted version of Bitcoin, but I barely know anything about BCH besides it has larger blocksizes...if anyone cares to clarify exactly what advantages BCH could have over BTC, I'm all ears. At any rate, ever since SegWit+Lightning Network have started up Bitcoin has been faster and cheaper than ever, at least in my experience.

I think if you go this route you should use Coinbase solely because they're actually insured if anything goes wrong - on the other hand, you'd be storing your Bitcoin on an exchange, so yea it's up to you on that front.

I could be wrong, but you should look into it. Coinbase also keeps records so taxes won't be a bitch.

If the 2x fork is what the majority of users choose to use, whatever the 2x devs do is what happens. Their version of Bitcoin starts running and it goes from there.

This is where we differ - you're assuming Coinbase is inherently bad, when they're not good or bad, they just *are*. They offer the services they offer, and users aren't forced to use them if they don't want to. Coinbase is also actually insured, which is a big step up from the rest of the competition. 
I'm not saying you or anyone else has to like or use Coinbase, but to ignore their uses solely because you want to pick a side is foolish, IMO.

IMO Bitcoin is best used as a store of value, which you can use to buy altcoins for specific needs.
For example, I leave my Bitcoin in my Trezor and only withdraw some when I need to. The bulk of my daily activity is monitoring alts I've bought with Bitcoin. 
If someone wants to spend Bitcoin directly, that's fine too. The only real differences that I can see are with adoption rates and volatility - IOTA makes moving funds a no-brainer because it has zero transaction fees, but its adoption is still pretty low. LTC would be good for purchasing goods after an IOTA transfer:
BTC &gt; IOTA, move IOTA wherever, IOTA &gt; LTC, buy whatever with LTC if they don't accept IOTA.
The only downside to storing the bulk of your funds in Bitcoin is the insanely slow block times, but when Lightning Network is released, and as SegWit adoption increases over time, Bitcoin might become more viable as a currency vs an asset.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:35:48

I'm assuming you're joking, but there *are* people who truly went all in and bet everything on Bitcoin's success. It's important to remember that when investing in Bitcoin, never buy more than you can afford to lose.
Also, controlling your private keys is super important if you want to actually "own" your Bitcoin. Electrum is a great, open-source wallet that gives you control over your private keys, and if you really want to play it safe get a hardware wallet like TREZOR or Ledger!

Seriously though, don't use PayPal to sell Bitcoin, you're asking for headaches. The buyer can cancel the transaction from either PayPal or their bank and walk away with your Bitcoin for free.
If you need to sell Bitcoin try LocalBitcoins.com or finding a Bitcoin ATM near you: 
Alternatively you could register on an exchange (Bittrex, Coinbase, etc), verify your identity and bank accounts, and buy/sell directly through there. The fees are probably the lowest with this option, but not everyone is comfortable verifying their identity for something as simple as exchanging currency.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:33:54
You'd be spending the alts, not BTC. If you invest wisely you can always sell the alts back into BTC for a profit (or not depending on the markets), and you can then spend the BTC if you're dead set on spending BTC and no other currency.
The difference comes down the technicals...is BTC better for making small, quick purchases, or is IOTA/LTC/etc better for that? Is BTC better for privacy, or is Monero/AEON what you'd prefer to use?

Ideally, no funds shuld ever be kept on any exchange. This is purely subjective though, so it isn't "bad" to keep your funds on an exchange, it's just more risky. Coinbase seems to be the least risky of all exchanges because they are insured.
OP is new to cryptocurrencies in general, or so I'm assuming. Usually, the best course of action is to download your own wallet and hold all your Bitcoin to yourself, however OP is trying to use Bitcoin for their business, and I'm pretty sure it's illegal to manage business funds in a "personal" account, but I don't know. I have no clue how Coinbase handles business vs personal accounts, or if they even make the distinction. I'm not a business owner :)
I'm suggesting that OP use Coinbase to become familiar with how accepting and converting BTC payments is handled before attempting to take it all on by themselves. One could argue that they won't learn how to manage this unless they do it themselves, and I agree, but starting from square one in cryptocurrency is usually tough - that's why Coinbase exists in the first place, it makes mainstream adoption easier. This is also why Vertcoin is gaining so much traction - a one-click miner is a game-changer in terms of mass adoption.
One of the main reasons I'm suggesting Coinbase over any other option is because Coinbase is insured against theft/fraud...the risk of losing one's Bitcoin balance is much lower. Plus they have support ready to answer questions. 
OP can certainly do everything Coinbase does. I'm thinking solely in terms of practice...if OP is already familiar with how Bitcoin works, I would recommend storing their funds in Electrum while using Bitcoin ATMs or Bisq to exchange between USD/BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:49:56
I diversify because BTC isn't a catch-all-coin, in the sense that it can't fill every niche simultaneously. The only real need to diversify comes from real world use of different cryptos, or if you want to try investing a bit in a small project that you think will rise in value over time.
I doubt anything will replace Bitcoin, but there are tons of cool projects to look into anyways. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:35:30

In its current form, Bitcoin acts best as a store of value. It is entirely impractical for small purchases, though SegWit and the Lightning Network should have a sizeable positive effect on transaction times and fees.
I don't honestly know that getting into Bitcoin mining is a "bad" idea, but at this point it's probably more cost-effective to buy whatever amount of Bitcoin you want directly and hold it, or use it to start trading other cryptocurrencies.
Just my two sats as a layman.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:29:50
It could be due to anything, but I think a small part of it is the psychological "mark" of $5000. It happens with every increment we pass relative to the growth rate - when the price was holding pretty steady people were excited when the price rose by $50, now $500 in a week doesn't seem unreasonable.
We could also be in a bubble, but who's to say? IMO Bitcoin's value is determined by what the community collectively is willing to pay for it, which is beautiful because if Bitcoin ever stops being useful, its userbase will naturally dwindle as people find more capable alternatives - I doubt Bitcoin will be the "one coin fits all" solution, but I do think that because it's the original it will be around for a long, long time. If it gets phased out of use, it will only be in the sense that it will actually be used solely as a store of value...people will not be able to use it as a currency. 
I think by the time the world economy is ready to move to crypto, people will be adept at managing multiple coins, each for a different set of uses. There won't be one "best" portfolio because everyone's portfolio will be tailored to their individual, specific needs. In this sense, I expect Bitcoin's value to continue rising steadily over time, due to its deflationary nature coupled with "lost" coins, as well as spreading awareness of its superiority to current financial systems. It makes for a great introduction to cryptocurrencies, at least.
TLDR: There's no telling what causes short-term price fluctuations, but if you plan for the long term, your rewards should, IMO, be very great.

@_date: 2017-10-17 14:03:52
It's practical, subjective advice...it isn't inherently "bad".
Choose your words carefully - I get where you're coming from but Coinbase makes initial adoption extremely easy. OP can take full control of the process themselves once they're more familiar with how things work.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:02:52
It wasn't a stupid move, as long as you bought what you could afford to lose ;)
In reality, I expect the price to keep rising long term, though it's hard to say that it will rise higher in the near future because there's no way to tell. Consider your purchase as one of those accounts that stays locked for a person until they're 18, and the interest has made it grow over time. 
Don't try to use Bitcoin as a currency - it's not there yet. Just hodl and have fun watching the markets, and consider getting into other cryptocurrencies as well! Bittrex and Bitfinex are great for BTC &lt;-&gt; Crypto trading, don't bother verifying for USD, your goal is to get more BTC out than you put in, which will ultimately mean more USD over time.
Welcome to the ride :)
Edit: If you ever need affirmation of your Bitcoin purchase, go to any price chart and look at the lifelong history:

This is what the Lightning Network that was just enabled on the Bitcoin Blockchain is currently doing.


True, because it's not best suited for coffee. Different coins for different purposes.
By the time the world economy is ready to move to crypto, people will be using multiple forms of currency, not just one. It's impossible for one coin to fit every niche at the same time, or so I assume.
BCH works, *but for what*? You can't spend it anywhere. It's just as much a tool of speculation as Bitcoin, except even more so, because I can spend BTC almost globally via a debit card or whatever. At least I can pay my bills with Bitcoin if I need to...you know?
All that aside, I feel that the forked Bitcoin crowd is getting way too ahead of itself. Literally the only difference at the time of the recent fork was that BCH wanted to rush a block size increase, while Core simply wanted to see if it was even necessary after activating SegWit.
Not to mention BCH is entirely controlled by mining corporations, while Bitcoin is driven by community goals, at least from what I've seen thus far.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:06:29
No, I've never needed to. I see it as a last resort. I'm going off nothing but assumptions, my own experiences with other face-to-face encounters, and other people's experiences I've read about thus far.
That's in terms of purchasing Bitcoin anyways, I've sent my family members some BTC face-to-face.
Edit: What does my personal experience matter though? OP is asking how to keep a face-to-face meeting legit, and the universal answer - because this is a general commerce/trade question - is to meet in a public place and make sure the BTC transaction is confirmed at least once before handing over cash payment. 
The process of sending BTC isn't the service being bought, you're buying an increase in balance. If it were a physical object, you could see it on a shelf but you couldn't physically remove it to buy it until the transaction has been confirmed at least once. You have to provide your own procedural safety nets since there are no institutions to provide them for you. 
What you're suggesting - handing over money before receiving Bitcoin - is reckless.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:03:40
Personally it feels like you're trying to force the positive ends of two magnets together, they made their choice and continue to try and disrupt Bitcoin, so while you might be after the few level-headed folks across both subs, it's attracting lots of others as well.

According to basic logic, and your post (which is logical and plainly written, kudos), BTC3 (aka: 2X) would essentially be a blockchain version of that "MyEtherWallet" scam site that's being spammed across social media - once the attackers have access to private keys they can spend the Bitcoin.

If you buy Bitcoin through Coinbase it's a good idea to also download the Electrum wallet and move your balance from Coinbase to Electrum. Electrum gives you control over your private keys, which is how you can prove you actually own your Bitcoin - Coinbase holds onto all the private keys of its customers, meaning whatever direction/fork Coinbase wants to follow, that's the fork their customers will follow.
Buy Bitcoin and immediately send it to your Electrum wallet, it won't matter what happens with the fork because you can choose which fork to follow in Electrum's settings.

Be sure to have a wallet installed on your computer/mobile device to transfer your purchase off-site. You do not actually control whatever you have stored in Coinbase, they control the private keys. 
If you use Electrum (computer and I think Android) you'll have direct access to your private keys, meaning you actually own them. It is wisest to store the majority of your holdings in a wallet you control, instead of in an exchange that controls your money for you.
Edit: Oh, that wasn't OP. Well OP, if you're using Coinbase...yea.

@_date: 2017-10-18 18:35:05


True, but the real-world supply is also affected - exchanges can't sell what they don't have. As time goes on and more and more coins are rendered inaccessible, the value of the remaining circulating supply increases. 
Essentially, at a certain point, 1BTC "has" to be worth "at least" a certain amount - a few years down the road it'll be inconceivable that we're potentially selling out holdings for a relatively meager amount, but that's all relative to the current moment, which is why patience is the most important skill to practice in cryptocurrency :)

I don't know what arguments they use because they're never actually arguments, they're just vague claims - stuff along the lines of "is backing out of an agreement!" when there was never an agreement in the first place, literal nonsense. 
The only "agreement" was the New York Agreement, which spawned SegWit2X in the first place. It's the agreement between the small group of companies that want to control Bitcoin. 
I'm sorry I don't have any more info, you could check out the 'btc' subreddit (dunno if linking to it earns a ban or not haha) to see what they're saying to each other. If you find any logical reasoning over there please post back, it would be nice to know as much as possible going forward.

@_date: 2017-09-09 14:55:20
2x only aims to rush an increase in block size, which may not even be necessary with the Lightning Network. 2x *is* about corporate control, notice how BitPay and other major forms of mainstream adoption are part of the agreement. 
The whole point of Bitcoin is *decentralized personal banking*, no controlling entities, no exclusive decision-making processes, no decisions made without community consensus. 
If Bitcoin needs a block size increase after SegWit:Lightning Network have had time to do their thing, it can be upgraded. There's absolutely no need to rush it at the whim of a group of CEOs.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:00:21
Decentralization is prized because it removes control of an entire system from a centralized/singular entity, lowering the risk of censorship.

If you plan to hold onto your BTC instead of day-trading, yes. Until you actually control the private keys associated with your Bitcoin, you do not actually own your balance. Technically, Gemini is letting you play around with their Bitcoin in exchange for your money.

Yes, it helps decentralize the network further and is also an active vote against 2X! It will consume a decent amount of data so if you have a data cap from your ISP keep an eye on it - I have 1TB from Comcast and when I run my node 24/7 I always use at least 3/4 of that, gaming and netflix as well but not nearly that often.

You must not have read my comment, please go back and see how it's an explanation of the facts, not a "simpleminded conclusion". Your refusal to provide any facts that support a 2x split, or even discuss the topic at all, speaks volumes. 
Have a good time acting as if giving control of Bitcoin's development to a private group of people, rather than keeping it decentralized, is what's best for the community. It's like you're plugging your ears and yelling in order to avoid hearing the plain truth of how stupid the NYA is for Bitcoin...but I guess shills are paid to do that, after all.

It increases the block size while also giving control of Bitcoin's development to a small group of companies, effectively centralizing Bitcoin. It's a hostile takeover attempt, there is no reason to increase the block size because SegWit works as intended. The reason 2X was even started was in case SegWit didn't work as intended...so 2X is entirely moot.
Edit: *Lots* of vote brigading going on in this thread.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:03:20


No, we are the community of people that believe in Bitcoin. We are not a corporate entity.
The NYA was organized in case SegWit+Lightning Network didn't do what they were designed and proven to do. SegWit has performed exactly as it was designed and proven to perform, Lightning Network remains to be seen, but as it currently stands the NYA is entirely moot - larger block sizes are not needed. Some may argue that "it would be nice to have just in case and it's irresponsible not to implement it now before it's too late", but that's not an actual reason to implement anything...that's just fear-mongering.
The only thing NYA is good for now is turning control of Bitcoin development over to a group of companies, instead of keeping it in the hands of the community at large.
Coincidentally, two major players in mass adoption are involved in the NYA - Coinbase and BitPay. They both plan on switching to 2x without letting their customers decide for themselves. 
I wonder if it's a good idea to let them also control actual development of the entire cryptocurrency. /s
Of course it's a bad idea...anyone claiming NYA is good for Bitcoin is either a shill or stands to profit from the hard fork, they aren't actually interested in keeping Bitcoin truly decentralized.
Core devs (aka: anyone competent enough to produce viable code) can always develop and, after attaining community consensus (not *just* hashing power), implement a block size increase...*if it's needed*. 
Right now it isn't needed, so hard forking to add one while simultaneously handing control of Bitcoin development directly to corporations makes literally no sense from either a "big picture" or a "community consensus" perspective.

The best thing you can do, regardless of drama, is control your private keys. 
If you're using Coinbase or any other hosted wallet you may not get a say in which chain you use. Electrum is a great wallet that gives you direct access to your private keys, and allows you to pick which chain you want to follow (as long as that chain is compatible with the version of Electrum you're using). 
I own a hardware wallet so I tend to hold all my Bitcoin in there and withdraw it when needed - I still have Electrum but between the two I like having a physical device in the way - unless a button is pressed, outgoing transactions remain unsigned.
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:13:45
Your account on Coinbase is credited with the amount of Bitcoin you purchased, but since Coinbase controls the actual private keys for your wallet, at the end of the day Coinbase owns the Bitcoin.
The best way to remedy this is to download Electrum and move your balance to there. That wallet gives you total control over your private keys and even allows you to choose which blockchain you want to follow in case of a fork.

They didn't state opinion, they stated fact. The NYA is a group of CEOs who formed the agreement in case SegWit/Lightning Network didn't do what they're designed to do...but they did what they're designed to do, so NYA is moot. Block sizes can be added when needed, and they aren't needed right now. 
The only thing NYA is good for is giving control of Bitcoin's development to the small group of CEOs that formed the NYA in the first place - otherwise it doesn't do anything that hasn't already been tried with BCH. NYA is literally a takeover attempt.
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:09:25
The main goal isn't a blocksize increase, it's taking control of Bitcoin's development for a small group of companies. Some 2X supporters might be brainwashed into thinking that a larger block size is all that's needed to permanently fix Bitcoin, but they seem to forget that Core devs can always implement a block size increase *if it's needed*. It isn't needed now, so the only other practical effect is that development is handed over to corporations. 
People want a decentralized currency that is controlled by the community alone. If it's controlled by a small group of profiteering interests, it isn't decentralized, therefore it isn't Bitcoin. 
Those who are actually interested in keeping Bitcoin decentralized and community-driven should consider running the latest full node version from bitcoin.org - 0.15.0.1 I believe. 
As always, control your own private keys and do whatever the hell you like.

Otherwise, consider [Coinbase]( they're the only insured exchange I've heard of and they're completely above-the-board (report to the IRS and everything), but [Gemini]( may also be insured.
You can always download a wallet and simply start accepting Bitcoin for goods/services you provide! [Electrum]( is IMO the best wallet because you actually control and can see your private keys, which are essentially the passwords for each address you're using.

TL;DR: If you walk away without paying for Bitcoin, before the transaction has confirmed, the seller can resend the transaction with a higher fee, but to their own address, so you're walking away with nothing. That's why you *wait until at least one confirmation* before handing over your cash. You'll have to wait either way, but I'd rather wait with my cash in pocket and pay when I know I've received the Bitcoin. Cash is physical...it's literally owned by whoever holds it...that is why you *do not hand the cash over first*.
When you do a face-to-face transaction, cash is the thing being physically traded, and the control of the deal rests with whomever holds the cash. As the buyer, you have the power to say, "I don't like the quality of what you're trying to sell me," which would be the case if the Bitcoin simply never confirms while you're meeting in a public place. As soon as you relinquish control of the deal, you've given up your right to receive your end of the bargain. This is why escrow services exist...there's no need to trust the person you're dealing with. 
The point of meeting in person is so the encounter is seen by others and hopefully caught on camera in some capacity, so that if you *are* robbed in any way, you have *something* to show the police. It's not just your coins, you're putting your physical being at risk by meeting someone from the Internet in person. I think you're making dangerous assumptions in your line of reasoning because the notion that you'd hand over the cash first, without waiting for a single confirmation, seems ludicrous to me.
PayPal works *if the buyer is an honest person*. Unfortunately, most sellers requesting PayPal are dishonest...but if your buddy wants to PayPal you some money and have you send them back 0.1 BTC, the only way the deal doesn't work is it you refuse to send them the 0.1 BTC. 
It all comes down to trust, and every situation is different.

It will be its own coin with its own development, just like any other altcoin. I believe it's just like Bitcoin as it stands now, but with a larger block size, and with private development (instead of open-source). You'd have to ask the btc subreddit for more info. Note that the btc subreddit will attempt to justify the privatization of Bitcoin, so try to focus purely on the technical details of what the 2X coin offers.
IMO, the 2X fork is a hostile takeover attempt of Bitcoin, similar to when the bCash crowd was going around referring to their coin as "Bitcoin", as if they could simply taker the name while it's in use.
Same thing here, except development is the target, not the brand. 2X wants to take over simply because they want to do things their way, not the community's way.

At this point 2X is more of a hostile takeover attempt than it is about keeping the community working together to find a common solution. Make whatever justifications you like, at the end of the day that's what is happening. It's removing control of Bitcoin's development from the community.

I mentioned Vertcoin solely to highlight why mass adoption is very important to a project's success. Coinbase focuses on mass adoption and like it or not, they are succeeding. Their success does not mean Bitcoin's failure, so I'm wondering why you're 100% against anyone using any 3rd party services, as if one bad egg means the rest are bad? Yes, you're right that they aren't needed, I'm not arguing that. But they're around if people need them :)

Check out the sidebar of this subreddit, there's a lot of information regarding forking and whatnot - by default every BTC wallet will use the BTC blockchain, but if you decide to try out a forked chain instead, you can change that setting in the wallet options. It's nothing you need to worry about if you're planning on using Bitcoin Core, not its forked variants (BCH, SegWit2X, BTU, etc)
If you're on Android, you can download Electrum. If you're on iOS, use Breadwallet, I believe it's open-source and the recovery phrase will work with Electrum when you get computer access.
With Coinbase it's generally alright to keep your Bitcoin balance on that site, you're only screwed if they decide to steal everyone's Bitcoin, and they're insured so if you lose anything you'll get it back...or so I'm led to believe.
One thing to keep in mind is that there's an upcoming fork between Bitcoin and SegWit2X. SegWit2X is a corporate takeover attempt of Bitcoin's development, effectively centralizing Bitcoin. Coinbase is one of the companies involved with SegWit2X, and the last I heard they were planning on making the switch to 2X regardless of what their customers want, but you'll have to look at Coinbase's website for more info.
If I were in your shoes I'd download Electrum/Breadwallet (depending on your phone OS), move my balance from Coinbase to my phone, and wait until I have computer access to restore my Electrum/Breadwallet phrase to the computer. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:01:03
Move your Bitcoin to Electrum and you won't need to worry about the fork. 
2X is a contentious, unneeded fork that also happens to give control of Bitcoin's development to a group of corporations (including Coinbase and BitPay). 
The only thing 2X is good for at this point in Bitcoin's history is centralizing it...the complete opposite of what Bitcoin is about. Any support you see for 2X is coming from shills or people who stand to profit from a successful 2X takeover.
If you hold your coins in Electrum you control your private keys, so you can choose whichever chain you want to follow, no need to follow the drama. This is the smartest route.

There's a lot of drama, but the key to avoiding it all is controlling your private keys. Download Electrum for your computer and move your balance into there, after you do more research you can actually choose which blockchain you wish to follow after the hard fork occurs.

Hells to the fucking no. If I'm reading it correctly, your system could allow someone to pay lots of money to ensure no autonomous car would ever hit them or anyone in their family, etc etc. I can picture this system being so broken at first I thought this was a joke, but I can see why it made sense at first.
Imagine a billionaire who pays top dollar to keep himself and his family protected - literally at any cost. How the hell is that a fair system? Hello, class cleansing, all that would need to happen is for the wealthy elites to band together and buy their own safety...literally. Then they'd just take rides as normal and probably make it a contest to see how many citizens each of them could kill in a day.

I'm not arguing against Bitcoin, I'm arguing against needless drama. Bitcoin works - when people have forgotten about Dimon, someone else will say something bad and everyone will rush to defend Bitcoin, thinking that one person's words could potentially end Bitcoin entirely. This shit happens over and over and over and yet there are still people who feel that the drama is necessary, when it's usually nothing but karma whoring.
If a post has an actual argument behind it, instead of "this person is bad because they said this", that's one thing. But the overwhelming majority of these anti-hater posts are "this person is bad because they said this", and that isn't productive IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:03:10
No, it's just the the "other side" never provides any facts to back their arguments, they just use fear-mongering and misinformation. 
I laid the situation out as it actually is - you can call a piece of shit a rose but it's still a piece of shit...you can dress up the NYA however you like, at the end of the day with everything we know so far, it's a takeover attempt.
Can you provide facts - not opinions - that indicate otherwise?

I'll second CoPay, it's really fast, feels very solid, and it's very easy to re-add a wallet you lost/removed. I had to reformat my PC on the fly and lost my software and OS, but had the wallet file saved elsewhere. I loaded up a new OS, installed CoPay, and chose one of the options for restoring my wallet. The file didn't work so I used the phrase instead, and nothing was missing or out of place.
I dunno if Armory is still around but if you have tons of free time and want to be super secure, use that. It's hardly efficient though.

I think one benefit to Bitcoin is that it doesn't require a college degree to learn and manage effectively. When people ask me if Bitcoin is money, I generally tell them, "it's basically a stock you can buy, sell, spend, or move at any time you want, without business hours to worry about. You just need to be able to accurately copy strings of text if needed."
I know it's a bit more complicated than that, but it kind of clicks of them after that...they can grasp the concept of buying Bitcoin, holding onto it to see how the value changes, then sell or spend depending on their needs. Then they understand the lack of a middle-man financial institution and they get a bit more excited. It's no longer magic Internet money to them, and it's a start at least.

I can't tell if this is serious or not...it's an appealing idea, but I'd love to see them at least acquire land first before buying in. That's another thing...you have the option of buying in, which will serve as part of the funding. I assume that if not enough funds are raised and the project fails, we don't get a refund, but you know what happens when you assume.

The trick with Bitcoin is that your finances are *your* responsibility. You need to be willing to do some reading (and re-reading) if you want to actually understand Bitcoin more completely. What you're asking for is a way to jump right in without understanding what you're getting involved in, and that's why a lot of new users freak out when the prices starts to drop.
You may want to hang around and get familiar with some terminology, or check the links in the subreddit sidebar for more detailed information. What works for some people may not work for you - you need to figure out what wallets and services work best for your current situation, and work with those tools.
Why do you want to use Bitcoin? What are your goals?

It sounds like your issue is that you installed Bitcoin to the C drive, ran out of room, and tried to do something fancy to avoid uninstalling/reinstalling to a larger drive.
Back up your wallet.dat file. Uninstall your current installation and reinstall to a larger hard drive that won't fill up. Move your wallet.dat file into the Bitcoin directory (I forget if it's the one in Program Files or AppData).
My node never takes longer than a minute to start back up again after a restart, my bet is that all the fancy stuff you're trying is unnecessary for your needs.

I prefer buying from ATMs because they usually don't require identifying info below a certain threshold, and they accept cash...Coinbase doesn't accept cash.
Edit: Looks like it's a 3.99% fee to buy with a debit card on Coinbase, whereas my local bATM is a 5.3% fee. I don't mind paying an extra 1.4% for instant purchasing power and barely any identifying info required (cell number needed for verification text).
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:51:46
The main thing I'd be worried about with bill pay services is that the info may get jumbled and the bill will be left unpaid - do the bPayment services you use accept any kind of liability? What's stopping them from receiving Bitcoin and leaving bills unpaid?
Sorry for the slew of questions, but yea if I can pay bills with Bitcoin I'm a lot better off than I thought I was.

Sorry bud, it's not actually *your* money, you're just using Coinbase's Bitcoin while you use their service. This is why people recommend not keeping any relatively significant portion of Bitcoin in wallets that you don't own the private keys to...to prevent this exact scenario from happening.
Sorry, it sucks and I wish I had something more heartening to contribute. But yea, literally every day there are users posting their issues with Coinbase and the majority of them involve trying to withdraw Bitcoin they've been keeping on Coinbase for convenience's sake.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:28:43
If you do not control the private keys to the addresses that hold Bitcoin, you don't own the Bitcoin.
I don't know if Poloniex holds the keys or if they let their customers hold them, but if they're anything like every other centralized service, I'm betting they hold the private keys. In this case, your safest bet would be to get a wallet that suits your needs and move the Bitcoin out of Poloniex asap.

Try Copay - it's open source, secure, and very convenient.
What is your wallet setting the transaction fee to? Can you change it to a custom amount?

Why, because they explicitly outline how you can and can't use their service in the TOS, and you chose to violate their TOS?
It's a private company, they can do whatever they want in terms of what's allowed and not allowed. You have the option of using a different service that won't close your account for using your money however you want.
FYI I'm not defending Coinbase, just giving the legal rationale. They're technically in the right, so it's on you to change service providers, and not bitch about your standard experience.

It's an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. 
I think a huge part of Bitcoin's popularity is that it gives users actual control over their money, in terms of storage and accessibility. Usually when it comes to money we're at the mercy of banks and other humans, but IIRC with Bitcoin there's not really much of anything that can truly cause the entire network to simply "stop". Maybe a global EMP, but then we'd have much bigger things to worry about, and we could still potentially use paper wallets. Imagine being a QR scribe in post-apocalyptic Earth haha. The point is, I feel that the global Bitcoin community would find a reliable way to keep things going.
I hold Bitcoin and spend it when I need to - if my bank is having technical difficulties or it's a holiday, I can always rely on Bitcoin. It's nothing more than technology, just like the Internet. You don't need to agree to any legally-binding terms in order to use it and it can be used globally without need for dealing with red tape or waiting obscenely long or even paying too high of a fee - I know some fees are high atm, but based off nothing at all I don't think that's going to last much longer.
I'm eager to see Bitcoin's final form, I'd like to expect some serious stability but who knows...all I'm fairly certain of is that it opens people up to a new type of finance that isn't ruled by other humans. You aren't subject to anyone's whim, as the recent RV and JW drama has shown. The only thing that's always going to be uncertain is the human element...how people react to said drama. People gotta calm the fuck down sometimes.
At any rate, I'm very glad Bitcoin exists. If it didn't I don't know where I'd be right now because it paid for my trip across the US a few years ago (thanks Hotels.com) and has kept me afloat in some sketchy times.

I'm not arguing this point, but it's completely subjective - what you consider "low", another person may consider "average".

The corporation is not an entity, it's just a name that goes on a lot of things. What individual people do with that name is entirely up to the individual.
The fact that you think less of anybody is a shame, seeing as you're hardly perfect yourself. Just because *you* wouldn't work for Microsoft doesn't make you morally superior to anyone.

I also used Coinbase for a very long time but I closed my account because the account closings had started and I didn't want to risk it, despite my relatively low account activity.
I'm not saying that every user has a negative experience. Of course the disgruntled users will post their experience - they haven't been treated fairly and they're reporting alarming corporate behavior. Are you discrediting them/their point solely for speaking out?
I'm calling out Coinbase for its behavior - randomly closing accounts without giving any reason isn't okay, even if it isn't happening to you. If Coinbase's baseline behavior is leaving the majority of people alone while at the same time targeting random users without giving any reason, that isn't okay, even if it isn't happening to you.
Do you feel that your lack of issues renders every other disgruntled user's experience invalid? What happens if your account is randomly closed?

From your other comments it looks like you're just trying to move 0.1BTC from NiceHash into your wallet, which has nothing to do with mining.
I don't know how NiceHash works, but if it has anything to do with mining there should be a place to specify a "Payout address", which is where you'll copy/paste your Bitcoin wallet address. Until you specify a payout address, NiceHash doesn't know where to send your payouts.

You could try BitSquare, or see if there's a Bitcoin ATM near you, they usually dispense cash. 
Personally, I'd hold onto it and watch the value of what BTC you have rise over time, then cash out when it's worth double what you could get now, but if you need the money now that's totally understandable.

I also used Coinbase for a long time but I closed my account because the random account closings had started and I didn't want to risk it, despite my relatively low account activity.
I'm not saying that every user has a negative experience. Of course the disgruntled users will post their experience - they haven't been treated fairly and they're reporting alarming corporate behavior. Are you discrediting them/their point solely for speaking out?
I'm calling out Coinbase for its behavior - randomly closing accounts without giving any reason isn't okay, even if it isn't happening to you. If Coinbase's baseline behavior is leaving the majority of people alone while at the same time targeting random users without giving any reason, that isn't okay, even if it isn't happening to you.
Do you feel that your lack of issues renders every other disgruntled user's experience invalid? What happens if your account is randomly closed?

Go to a Bitcoin ATM. The one near me takes cash and doesn't require any identifying info. I go there with extra tip money and am done in 5 min.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:31:56
Bitcoin ATMs are great. They usually have higher fees but the one near me doesn't require any ID if you purchase below a certain threshold. It takes cash so I literally drive to the mall with extra tip money and add that much more Bitcoin to my holdings.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:19:01
It wasn't secured in the slightest, if the wrong person wanted to they could remotely switch off miners at will. 
It doesn't matter if that was the intent, it was still a gaping security flaw that should never have made it into the source code until it had been improved/secured. That's the main issue I think people have with Bitmain, anyways.

Since you're interested but not totally familiar I'd start with buying a small, affordable amount - say, $100? Whatever works for you, you can buy any dollar amount you want!
The quickest way I can think of to get started with Bitcoin is to download a mobile wallet of your choice and see if there's a [Bitcoin ATM near you]( - you can buy Btcoin with cash and they usually don't require ID, but every machine is different. 
In terms of mobile wallets, for iOS I like Copay, but they won't be supporting BIP 148...dunno about BreadWallet but that's another popular option. I don't have an Android but Mycelium is usually the go-to wallet, no clue about their BIP 148 support.
That's another thing...BIP 148 is currently a hot topic and it's causing a lot of confusion. No matter what happens, the price may drop after August 1st just because of the sheer buildup of chaos and confusion. You may consider using the next three months to do a shitload of research and become intimately familiar with Bitcoin and current issues, then buy in if/when the price drops enough to be super attractive to you - for most long-time hodlers, *any* time is a good time, you just gotta navigate the short-term drama ;)

Yikes, that's a rip :/ I haven't used Coinbase in about a year, ever since they started arbitrarily closing accounts without giving any reasons, effectively robbing people.
I'm near Springfield, OR and [there's a bATM at the nearby mall]( it too raises the price and also has a ~5% fee but it's totally worth it for the convenience and relative lack of identifying info needed to buy or sell. The daily buy limit is $9k.
I dunno, personally I don't mind using Coinbase or other online exchanges, but I much prefer using the ATM. It takes cash. That alone is fucking worth it!

Coinbase is not the best go-to option for new users. Bitcoin ATMs are much more convenient and rarely require any identifying information below a certain transaction amount. bATM's aren't always around so online wallets are a good option to have, but DO NOT rely on them for storage and safe-keeping. IE: As soon as you purchase Bitcoin on Coinbase, send it offsite to a wallet you own.
A powerful combo would be a mobile wallet like Copay, a PC wallet like Armory, and a handful of options the user can use to buy/sell.
Please do not recommend Coinbase by default - while they are fairly reliable for many users, they also:
 - close accounts without reason
 - cancel buy/sell orders without reason
 - are unresponsive to some users experiencing issues
All you have to do is search "Coinbase" in this subreddit to find a long list of horror stories. If you never have an issue with them, great. But when you do have an issue, it's a fucking issue. I see too many cases of "well *I'VE* never had an issue, so Coinbase is 100% reliable," and that's a fucking selfish line of thinking right there. Don't sell out new users just because you can't see the bigger picture.

@_date: 2017-05-25 13:41:30
It isn't though. In fact it's loads easier to acquire Bitcoin now. The only reason people are having any issue at all at the current moment is due to the increasing price (exchanges don't want to lose out of profit/money due to smart customers) and high transaction fees. 
I personally haven't had any issues with transaction fees, but then again I'm not using Bitcoin for microtransactions so any fees I pay are still very reasonable.
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:53:25
Hardware wallets are super secure, but if you don't feel that you'll be dealing with too much money then a software wallet will be fine. Also if you don't want to spend more money to use Bitcoin, software/mobile wallets are free alternatives.
Armory is super secure but very inconvenient (takes forever to start up every time), Copay is pretty secure and pretty convenient (you can buy/sell BTC but you have to go through Coinbase lol). I only really have experience with those two but I've never had an issue so I dunno.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:52:11
That was never said lol - any BTC kept on any device is increasing in value, so even if you only have 0.1 on your mobile wallet it's almost to the point where 0.05 is more appropriate :)

You're on a spectrum of convenience to security when it comes to buying or selling Bitcoin. LocalBitcoin is more convenient but less secure, Coinbase is less convenient but more secure.

I like using Bitcoin ATMs but they can have a relatively high fee (5-10%).
The one I go to is like 10 min from my house and doesn't require any identifying info if you buy below a certain dollar amount, and it takes cards and cash. Plus you can email the ATM owner with any questions and they respond the same day, within an hour usually.
Loads more convenient than being at the mercy of a business, so I'm willing to pay a 5-10% fee. Others aren't :)

I did that same method after checking BIP39 on a whim. The wallet restore process completes but the Electrum wallet remains empty, and my copay wallet is definitely not empty.

@_date: 2017-05-11 00:28:57
What? Yes, you can find any transaction that's been sent to the blockchain on blockchain.info, then link to it. 
IIRC Coinbase should have an option for every transaction to "see on blockchain.info" which takes the user to the actual transaction as it's registered in the blockchain.

I generally just hodl my Bitcoin, rarely spending it unless necessary. From what I can gather the different wallets either will or won't support BIP148, so say if the UASF goes in favor of BIP148, what happens to coins being stored in, say, a BIP44 wallet?
Could you briefly describe what is actually happening with the soft fork? Regardless of current drama, why does it make a difference what wallet you store Bitcoin in, apart from user preference? Is there such a thing as an overall "best", or generally most compatible/flexible wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:19:22
The under covers stuck to using the term "exchange", so maybe it has to do with legal terminology. I wonder if the seller would be okay if they'd have been like, "Dude I just want to sell you my Bitcoin, I'm not an exchange." Though from the sounds of things, this guy was essentially running an under-the-table exchange on purpose.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:21:20

Yes, I misused "literally". A better word would be "mostly".
Regarding the gambling site claim, OP stated that the address was for their Mycelium wallet. No rules were broken AFAIK.
Coinbase closes accounts for no given reason, there is no evidence that any TOS were broken, in this example or in other cases. That's the whole issue.
Do you care to address the actual issue instead of getting caught up in semantics?

@_date: 2017-07-24 15:25:02
I guess I'm confused about a chain fork then. As far as I understand it, having two separate blockchains will allow either coin to be used independently of the other, meaning that as long as I have the same addresses stored in two different wallets (one for each chain) before the split, I should be able to spend the total stored in each wallet after the split regardless of how much each coin is worth, correct?
I'm envisioning setting up a Bitcoin Cash wallet and importing my private keys in the event of a split, so I have regular BTC as well as BCC to spend. If BCC fails it's fine, it's essentially free money in this scenario because whatever I spend on the BCC chain will not affect the BTC chain, correct?
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:42:11
The "problem" you're outlining is called "limited supply", and it's one of the main things that make Bitcoin superior to traditional fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:59:30
Can you afford to lose what you spent on BTC? If not, cash out and wait till youi can.
If you can, let the price drop and use the chance to scoop up more. Over time the price will rise, which is why "hodling" is such a prevalent meme.
Look at price charts from 6 months ago, you may have bought in at a relatively inopportune time, but at least you're not buying in at $5000.

I clicked the "Options" button underneath the seed input field and checked "BIP39 seed", which let me proceed, then it asked me for my BIP44 account number - it advised me to keep it at 0 if I didn't know it. Electrum then loaded up a blank wallet, so I guess it didn't work haha.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:04:18
Bitcoin...is like a car.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:08:26
Yea it's very slow to start up, it's best for long-term storage where you don't access the funds often, hence the lack in convenience.
Try Copay, it's open source and stores the private keys on the device you're using, so you do actually own the Bitcoin you keep in the wallet, and it's very convenient.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:23:59
Not OP but I'm trying to wrap my head around this. After the fork there are two blockchains, both with a balance in Wallet1. By moving the balance on the Bitcoin blockchain to a brand new Wallet2, the old Wallet1 is now free to be used exclusively on BCC, with the original funds in place since the transaction was never posted to the BCC blockchain?
If that's correct, should I be importing my private keys to a new Electrum BTC wallet, or sending them via regular transaction...if it even matters since it's all done in the BTC blockchain?
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:19:13
Ask him to send you a link to the transaction on blockchain.info. If he refuses or cannot produce the link, it sounds like you got scammed :/
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:08:56
Bitpay and Copay wallets are open source and the private keys are stored+encrypted on your device if you decide to back up your wallet, which the wallet pretty much begs you to do - it uses a 14-phrase seed so if you write it down you can restore to any device with the wallet installed.
I use them semi-regularly and just recently got a Bitpay debit card, so that'll be fun to try out :)

The one shred of doubt I have is sending BTC to another Electrum wallet, I'm concerned that when I try to import the seed to a BCC wallet it will see the balance as 0, but I know that they're on different chains and technically the outgoing transaction never happened. It's just weird because this is rare and this is the first time I've had to do something like this, the learning process is grand :)

I'm planning on finding a downloadable BCC wallet and attempting to import a private key, instead of using a BCC website, because a BCC website will most probably empty the address associated with the private key into one they own. Assuming a BCC wallet will simply import a BTC private key, a copy will be made, not a duplicate, because there are separate blockchains.
My understanding is that if there's a fork, the difference between BTC and BCC is equivalent to the difference between BTC and LTC. Completely different blockchains, so neither is affected by the other. 
AFAICT, the private keys alone are valid on both blockchains at least initially, so two separate, potential balances can be created because both chains will recognize/accept the keys and use them in their unique way. 
I wish this was part of the subreddit's FAQ regarding the split.

That site is for "Bitcoin Unlimited" ("BU" - Roger Ver's creation), this is not for "Bitcoin the ~~open-source~~ community-wide, consensus-driven cryptocurrency".
I agree, don't support this site.
The *actual* Bitcoin site is [Bitcoin.org]( and you can find secure wallets there as well. Use a wallet you control, don't use someone else's wallet.
Edit: Yea! Fuck best practices!
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:13:55
Coinbase is good because it's insured and you stand the best chance of recovering your balance if they're stolen while being stored in Coinbase's wallets. Otherwise, you're asking for headaches. You also have to be careful who you send Bitcoin *to*...they'll close your account if you send money to any flagged addresses they have stored.
Using Coinbase is like asking your friend with really good renter's insurance to hold onto your gold bullion indefinitely...except when you ask for your gold back your friend sometimes gives bullshit excuses like "Sorry, taking some me-time," or "My mom says that the people you hang out with are a bad influence so I can't talk to you anymore, btw I'm keeping your gold kthx"
This is why I always recommend that people immediately transfer anything they buy via Coinbase to a wallet/address they have the private keys for. The address you generate in your wallet cannot be on their "flagged addresses" list, and you're eliminating the control they have over your balance. 
Another popular exchange is [Gemini]( but I have no experience with them.
An open-source option is [BitSquare]( which is a P2P network and is very nicely put together. Honestly I should be recommending this above all else, it's probably the best, practical option as far as "exchanges" go.
My personal favorite option lately has been the local Bitcoin ATM ( The buy/sell fees are usually around 5% give or take 1-2% depending on market fluctuation and community drama, but the machine handles cash and I don't need to provide ID for buys up to $500...but if I wanted to buy more than $500 I'd probably just break it into two transactions - the whole process of using the bATM, from touching the screen to walking away, takes less than 5 minutes. For the insane level of convenience, I'm willing to pay a decent fee. Of course, fees are nuts right now so I've held off from buying.
Biggest tip: Always use the best option for the immediate situation, don't use one as a cookie-cutter solution for all your needs.

IMO the best thing to do before freaking out about the price is to look at the charts in the following order: 3 days, 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, all.

If you're on PC:
 - Download Electrum, install, create new wallet (create a password for it please)
 - Get a receiving address from the "Receive" tab, copy it to clipboard
 - In Coinbase, go to Send Money (or whatever it's called). Paste the address into the appropriate field - double check and make sure it's the same address in Electrum
 - Decide how much to send...to be safe send your total Coinbase balance ("Send Max", maybe), confirm all the transaction information is correct, send the transaction through
 - Balance will show up in Electrum. You now have the option of backing up your wallet's private keys somewhere safe. You are also now safe from any chain split.
To send money out of Electrum:
 - "Send" tab, paste in the destination address, type in amount of BTC or USD, make sure the fee is appropriate, click Send.
You may want to enable custom fees in Options if the transaction fee is high no matter where you move the slider. Do some research on appropriate fee amounts per kilobyte, I couldn't offer any advice.

The simplest way would be to download Electrum to your computer and move your purchased coins to there. Once they've arrived, you can export your wallet's private keys in .json or .xls file formats and secure them however you like. Alternatively you can view the private key for any address on a whim, so if you're only concerned about one address you can manage them individually.

It comes down to the individual, not Bitcoin as technology. You need to get your thinking straightened out. The Internet still isn't perfect, by your logic it's not ready for the average person and shouldn't be used until it is.
Do you not see how nonsensical your argument is?
Remember when cell phones were first introduced? They didn't take off right away, not everybody had one or understood how to use them, I remember teaching my grandma how to text message using T9. Hell, she still doesn't quite get it. That doesn't mean cell phones aren't ready for mass adoption.
I would argue that mass adoption is how technology is made more user friendly, not the other way around, solely because without a user base to use the technology, development inevitably ceases unless there's a die-hard fan that's willing to keep it alive. 
If you expect a technology to be perfect upon its creation, you need to get a reality check. Bitcoin/technology in general is always being improved on, just because it's not perfect *NOW* doesn't mean it's useless, as you seem to insinuate. It's hard to tell exactly what your point is because you don't use logic to form your arguments.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:50:26
AFAIK they don't need it - there can be two blockchains coexisting at once, the UASF will have less hashpower so it may become easier to mine with GPUs again, but that's about all I can gather with my limited knowledge/experience.
What I don't understand is why miners are being blatantly greedy (wanting to maintain ridiculously high transaction fees), without being able to offer any argument against BIP 148 besides "It doesn't have majority miner support". 
Well, *duh*. Miners have no incentive to give up huge transaction fees, do they?
Am I missing something?? I'm trying to wrap my head around this entire scenario and it always seems to come back to miners wanting more money for their work, leaving users to pay high transaction fees. It doesn't benefit both sides, it only ever benefits one or the other.
Could someone explain it a bit better if I'm not understanding it correctly?

Word, gotcha. I like having a whole Bitcoin for aesthetic purposes but I usually recommend newcomers buy about $20-$50, if not $100...whatever they can reasonably afford. That way they get a feel for the process, can watch their holding's value rise/fall, and don't stand much to lose.
 Bitcoin ATMs make it extremely easy to buy any dollar amount you want so that's been my go-to suggestion for newcomers.

@_date: 2017-06-17 16:45:52
Edit: Oh right - August 1st is when the UASF (BIP148) is set to automatically activate, so it's the deadline for any consensus-backed decisions. Once it activates, hands are forced.
There's a pending User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) as well as a proposed alternative soft fork, as well as a pending hard fork...IIRC.
Basically, BIP148 includes SegWit, which AFAIK reduces transaction fees. 
Miners don't like that because they make money off transaction fees, and one person (Jihan Wu) has control over a gigantic amount of mining power. He wants to fork off and create his own coin that he controls using a similar user-activated soft fork, but one that's tailored to making him money and not much else. BIP 148 will threaten his profits and will be happening anyways, so he's branching off and flipping the community off at the same time.
The hard fork might not be too popular but I think it's still an option - basically there is a small group of developers who got greedy and want to create a version of Bitcoin with larger block sizes. I forget why it's not a good idea, but I'm pretty sure it comes down to this corrupt group of people having control over the entire currency, which goes against Bitcoin as open-source, P2P currency.
To prepare for whatever happens, download Electrum and move all your Bitcoin to it, then back up your actual private keys. No matter what happens, you can use your private keys to restore your balance to whichever chain you want to stay on, and you're good.
Personally, I just want people to stop letting their egos get in the way. SegWit is obviously a good idea, and those who oppose are obviously opposing it out of greed/financial gain. I'm not a pro though, I'm probably misjudging the entire situation.

If you have a Bitcoin ATM near you you'll be able to buy Bitcoin for any cash amount and you usually won't have to provide identification if you're purchasing below a certain value.
The fees may be higher, but remember you can drive to the ATM whenever you want, deal with cash, and be done with each transaction in under 5 minutes. 
Compare those hoops to using any exchange. Why do you think you pay a $1-$4 ATM fee with fiat ATMs? The fee is for convenience...Coinbase takes care of everything but they act as a completely new entity that your spending habits have to be cleared by. 
To me, the convenience and control is worth a slightly higher service fee, especially if I'm not subject to customer support if a bank transfer goes awry, or the exchange simply decides to put everything on hold while they wait for the price to rise or fall more.
A lot of BATM operators are available to contact, I always double-check with the operator of the nearby ATM to make sure there's enough for my purchase. They appreciate when you ask beforehand.
Not everyone will be able to use Bitcoin ATMs, but they are located all over the US, Americas, Asia, and Europe...no info for Russia yet...but there are also thousands of services that host a Bitcoin ATM on site along with other currency exchange services, instead of having a standalone ATM in the middle of nowhere.
You don't *always* need to use Coinbase, but it's a good, insured option when needed. I would suggest that newcomers only use Coinbase to buy, and IMMEDIATELY transfer your purchase off their site and to a wallet you control.
Newcomers, read up on MtGox. Never store your coins in a wallet you don't actually own the private keys to.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:37:46
With Bitcoin ATMs the process is literally easier than Western Union, and you don't need to give out your ID or speak to another human.
1. Download mobile wallet if buying for yourself, otherwise have destination address ready
2. Approach Bitcoin ATM, purchase however much you want with cash or card (or alternate cryptocurrency sometimes)
3. Specify receiving address, confirm purchase
4. Go about your business. 
The whole process takes less than 5 minutes, I'm not sure why you think it's so complicated.
Edit: Sorry, I mistook you for the original commenter - point still stands.
The amount of information needed to do this is minimal and does not require years of experience with Bitcoin. It is readily available information that anyone can find for themselves if they actually want to use Bitcoin.
Edit: Whoever is downvoting this completely valid and true information, get your ego out of your ass. I don't give a fuck about your feelings, I want people to have the best information possible, and you're hindering that. If you don't agree, explain why. For fuck's sake.

This is exactly the problem - OP went through several steps before finally complaining after the fact, when they could have asked for advice beforehand and avoided excessive fees.
It's not a matter of us being dicks to newcomers, it's a matter of newcomers expecting Bitcoin to be perfect and getting mad when it's not. There's only so many ways we can share the same information - if people don't want to learn, we can't force them to.
I'm really nonplussed at how many false White Knights showed up recently. It's like they all feel the exact same way (ie: "Bitcoin will never succeed, ever, no matter what you say") and use the exact same bullshit excuses in various threads. One might be forgiven for thinking they are all working together in some fashion, but I wouldn't dream of accusing faceless usernames of gaming a voting system that affects visibility of information that might cause invested interests to lose money.

Every outgoing transaction needs a transaction fee, which only the sender must pay to initiate the transaction. It does not cost anything to receive or store Bitcoin.
For instance if you were to accept Bitcoin donations, people could send you whatever you want and you could watch your address balance go up, all for free. However, when you want to use any of that balance, you must send it from that address, and sending Bitcoin anywhere requires a transaction fee. 
If you have the private key for an address with a balance, some wallets allow you to "sweep" the funds, which is a form of transaction (address1 to address2).
Alternatively, some wallets let you "import" a private key, which means what it says: you are keeping your Bitcoin in an address and importing that address into an existing wallet, so no transaction is created.
I like to think of it like email...if you get a new phone you don't need to create a new email address and manually forward all of your email to the new address, you simply use your account info (or other recovery data) to import your existing email into the new device.
TLDR: You pay a fee if you create an outgoing transaction. If you simply receive Bitcoin, you do not pay the transaction fee, the sender does.

I like holding onto my own private keys and letting the out of control egos destroy each other - in the end, Bitcoin will remain.

The white paper is pretty good at explaining it in reasonable detail, but yea there have been tons of changes and they're still coming, it'll probably be impossible to ever truly fully comprehend Bitcoin as a whole.
It's not really a lottery though, Bitcoin has inherent value separate from USD or any other currency, but obviously USD became the point of reference. Bitcoin is used for barter all the time. The technology exists...it's like you're arguing the Internet might not succeed because it's complicated.

Not everyone - every community has its fair share of diversity, no community is exempt. Lots of people hold onto what they have and never spend, some spend and buy more all the time, some fall in between, others nowhere on the spectrum at all. 
Without use, I feel like Bitcoin would stagnate. Regardless, the blockchain technology will definitely be used for other, non-currency applications...it's a very powerful concept that simply works.
It depends on how *you* want to use Bitcoin, based off current circumstance, need, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:18:16
Use Coinbase solely to buy or sell Bitcoin, do not use them to hold anything. They have a nasty habit of making funds inaccessible for no reason. I would suggest downloading Electrum for your desktop PC because it gives you complete control over your private keys.
When you want to buy or sell, use Coinbase and immediately transfer anything you earn off site. The longer it's stored in their wallets that you don't control, the greater the chance is that you'll lose it.
You aren't guaranteed to have issue with Coinbase, but please search this subreddit for "Coinbase help" and see the years and years of countless horror stories, sprinkled with the handful of resoundingly positive experiences that happen on every Blood Moon after ritualistic human sacrifice. 
TLDR: Don't let Coinbase control your money. You're your own bank now, and you have a lot of reading to do :)

@_date: 2017-06-19 17:03:44
The rates/fees depend on the ATM, but they're generally more expensive. 
You're able to buy Bitcoin with cash and without providing ID under a certain purchase threshold, so the convenience factor is through the roof. Otherwise, if time isn't a priority, you can get more BTC for your money with another route.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:22:56
No sweat! It's a lot of info to take in all at once :)
If you don't want to use Coinbase you could try Gemini, a similar exchange but it seems to be much more reliable all-around. Another popular P2P option is LocalBitcoin, or BitSquare. BitSquare is actually really nice, if a tad underpopulated.
My favorite choice is using Bitcoin ATMs, which are all over the world! Here's the site for finding them, it's free: 
The one I go to is currently (7:15AM PST) asking a 6.4% buy fee and a 4.1% sell fee, nothing unreasonable.
You may pay higher fees than with Coinbase/exchanges, but remember that you're not having to submit ID, link bank accounts, or be subject to any 3rd party judgements regarding your spending habits. The convenience factor is through the roof, though you can still be robbed in person which is where the risk lies. Go with a big friend for your first time if your area is less-than-reputable haha :P
Another cool thing, most Bitcoin ATMs also support alternate cryptocurrencies, so you're not just limited to using Bitcoin if you really don't want to be!

Edit: If anyone cares, I explain how responsibility *isn't* a bad thing, and how just because Bitcoin isn't perfect *NOW*, doesn't mean it will never improve, as everyone downvoting me seems to think. Have a great day, rational thinkers!
TLDR: People are trying to say it's literally impossible to use Bitcoin right now. I'm telling them why they're wrong based off personal experience. That's why I'm being downvoted. I'm simply nonplussed at the groupthink going on.
List of bullshit I've had to refute:
 - People who are new to Bitcoin are not intelligent
 - If you aren't subscribed to you'll never, ever, know about Bitcoin
 - Older folk will have to ask questions when they are learning, therefore Bitcoin is too utterly complicated to ever begin to learn
 - People shouldn't have to learn about Bitcoin in order to use it, and the fact that people have to learn how to use it makes Bitcoin completely inferior to existing financial systems
 - There are literally no Bitcoin ATMs and no other similar methods of buying Bitcoin
 - If you want to send $3000 worth of Bitcoin it costs $150, therefore Bitcoin is the same as Western Union
 - Bitcoin (created ~2010) in its current form is inferior to existing financial systems and banks (decades and centuries, respectively) in their current form, because "it's complicated" and "fees are as high as Western Union"
 - Using a Bitcoin ATM takes three steps and less then 5 minutes to complete the buying process, so it's too complicated.
The list goes on, but you get the idea...utter nonsense.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:43:13
I've seen BIP 141 and BIP 148 - don't they both have SegWit? Why is 148 favored more?
My understanding is as follows, and it's hardly complete:
 - Wu has mining power and greed
 - Community has end say
 - Without SegWit, transaction fees will continue to increase at whatever rate
 - With SegWit, fees go down but small block sizes pose another issue
 - BIP 141: Just contains SegWit
 - BIP 148: Contains SegWit and other adjustments, but nothing for block size
 - SegWitx2: Barry Silbert's attempt at solving both issues at once, but from a place of ignorance and greed
 - As long as users have actual control over their private keys, it doesn't matter what happens, they just may have to wait for a certain period of time before being able to choose a chain and spend on it.

Thank you for acknowledging that Bitcoin is not incomprehensible for new people to use, or at least begin to figure out.
The biggest goal, IMO, is to steer newcomers away from the notions that they'll:
 - get rich quick
 - be rich just because they bought some Bitcoin
 - have to buy a huge chunk of Bitcoin to get started
 - have to understand cryptology and computers *in complete detail* in order to send or receive a single Bitcoin transaction
 - be able to switch their finances entirely to Bitcoin right now without any risk whatsoever, and if there's ever any hint of a risk or complication, Bitcoin will not succeed because it inherently "too complex" (as if to suggest modern banking systems *don't* require reading and re-reading 20+ pages of Terms and Conditions written in Legaliese to fully understand, instead of an 8-page white paper written in plain English)
These are the main arguments against "Bitcoin adoption by newcomers" that I've seen being plastered all over threads in the last couple weeks, and it's clearly the work of a group of paid shills who all use the same, illogical, emotional arguments.
I'm tired of seeing "people" say that Bitcoin is too complicated for newcomers - it's literally as easy as using an ATM if you're able to read and comprehend language. If you're blind, deaf, and mute...maybe Bitcoin is complicated. But even then, Helen Keller wrote/dictated a fucking book before personal computers existed.

Aren't fees high across the board though? I'm currently using Electrum on my desktop and the fees are ~$10 to send ~$40, but if I sweep the balance into Breadwallet the fee is closer to $2, if done through the Breadwallet app anyways. 
My goal is to store my balance in a wallet that won't be rendered useless by any kind of fork, and that's something Breadwallet is advertising.

It's exactly like the Internet, I agree.
How fast did it take for the Internet to become second nature?
How many people were claiming it was too complicated for newbies to ever learn? 
There's been a lot of "Bitcoin is simply too complicated for anyone new to understand", and that simply *is not true*. 
People can learn, but it's like there's a popular opinion of "if you don't get it, you never will"...and that mentality is more dangerous to Bitcoin than any fork or chain split.
I'd love to hear how you guys make it easier for people to understand, I've got it down to 4 steps and under 5 min to get a person from no Bitcoin knowledge to owning some. 
Everybody is different, and some people aren't great at technology, but it is by no means the majority. 
Please stop focusing on this tiny little segment of people who are afraid to learn, and focus on making Bitcoin easier to use in general - that's what this community is always doing, except recently it seems.
There's a definite pattern of hand-holding/white knighting *against* Bitcoin adoption lately, and I'm wondering what's driving it, since none of it is true and/or based on conjecture and emotions. You don't *have* to pay high fees for a transaction to go through, but instead of figuring it out, people shout back "FEES TOO HIGH!!!" 
Everyone is different - I support people's right to learn for themselves. Stop telling me responsibility is a bad thing.

I'm running a 148 node but I'm not using it as my wallet, I'm using Electrum for that because I have access to my private keys and it supposedly supports 148. Is this sufficient, or does my balance need to be stored in the node wallet? I don't see why but I dunno.

Any currency/economy will have gambling of some form, it's not exclusive to Bitcoin or non-fiat currencies.
Bitcoin is a technology that isn't going away - it's been created and it has a ton of potential. The block chain technology that Bitcoin uses is very powerful code in and of itself, so even if Bitcoin doesn't succeed, there are plenty of other ways the invention of Bitcoin will and already has benefitted humanity.
There is nothing inherently good or bad about Bitcoin, just as with anything. It depends on how it's used. If you expect Bitcoin to be a perfect replacement for current financial systems, you're going to be sorely disappointed. The community helps guide how Bitcoin works, as is made clear by the current debate regarding Segwit, Bitmain, and whatever else is going on now. 
I guess the point is, if you're just here to try and shine a totally negative light on Bitcoin, think again. If that's how you want to see it, then maybe it's not for you. But I encourage you to read the white paper to at least begin to understand what you're actually dealing with.

Every single Bitcoin ATM is different - some may require ID, but the vast majority do not as long you buy under a certain threshhold, in which case you can make multiple small purchases if ID is a huge no-no for you. It is usually not necessary if you don't want to provide it.


Bitcoin ATMs are found worldwide: 


The fees vary from ATM to AtM and day-to-day based off Bitcoin's recent market trends, you can contact ATM operators for more information. The ATM near my house only charges ~5% to buy or sell. Given the insane level of convenience using the ATM provides, I'm willing to pay *slightly* more per purchase than going through Coinbase and potentially losing access to my funds while they unfuck themselves. 
Please don't make false claims, especially if you're simply making obtuse statements without providing any evidence.

I'm not too familair with how this has all gone down and I'm still unsure as to what services I want to use - BIP 148 makes sense from a user standpoint and it levels out the mining playing field, as far as I can tell, but again I don't know much about all of this.
I'm just trying to make sure my balance isn't worthless when the dust settles, I really don't care how things are settled as long as both miners *and* users win. If it's one or the other there will never be an agreement. All I know is it seems that miners are the choke point, not users...we're still paying higher and higher fees, there's not much else we can do besides run a full node in support. It's like miners against BIP 148 are punishing us for being the victim or something, literally doesn't make sense to me.

Is it just a short term profit grab that Segwit is preventing? Why do people oppose it, apart from the fact that it blocks asicboost?

So once you have your Electrum wallet created the main window will open and you'll see a series of tabs, starting with History.
To move funds from Coinbase to Electrum (key parts bolded):
1.  **On Coinbase, click "Send Money"** and a page will open with some fields you need to fill in. Leave this page open and go to Electrum.
2.  **In Electrum, go to the "Receive" tab and copy the Receiving Address it lists automatically** - this address is stored in your Electrum wallet file and can be retrieved along with its private key whenever you want. You do not have this luxury with Coinbase, which is why you're essentially storing your balance in someone else's wallet if you use Coinbase.
3. **Paste the Receiving Address into the field in Coinbase that says something like "Recipient"**, I haven't used Coinbase in years so they may have changed it. 
 - You should be an option to **"Send Total Balance"**, or something like that. Click that and Coinbase will not leave any Bitcoin remaining in your account...if they do it'll be a very small amount.
I think that's pretty much it, Coinbase will take care of the fee automatically so it should confirm in average time. The only thing you really need to do is confirm that the correct destination address was copied into the Coinbase transaction form, and that you're sending your entire balance.
I hope experienced Coinbase users can weigh in, I'd hate to be the reason you lost your balance :/ Feel free to make another post with more detailed questions about the sending process if you need.

You're just the best Bitcoin user ever OP.
Hey new people who don't know what cold storage is and were hoping that OP would offer up that information - it's an offline storage solution that you control, as opposed to Coinbase's Vault, which is online and you don't control. 
"Offline" as in, not stored as data in your computer's hard drive or memory. 
Hardcore secure: A photograph of a paper wallet dunked in a glass of black colored water mixed with ashes, JPG'd to a single pixel, layered and printed as the background of grayscaled modern art collages, blended with stomach acid, and stored in the Arctic.

But in all seriousness, a paper wallet is the most basic option. Store it as you would any other precious item. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:29:02
It's always worth it to invest, but it's up to you to decide on when it's most reasonable for you to get started. 
Come August 1 the price *may* drop significantly, depending on how things go down. If you buy now, you may have buyer's remorse, unless you can break away from valuing Bitcoin solely off the USD. When it comes to buying Bitcoin, the general rule of thumb is to buy the dip and hodl the rise, but that changes depending on larger patterns, community drama, etc etc. Think extremely long term...like 10+ years. The more Bitcoin you have over time, the better off you'll be.
You don't have to buy a full Bitcoin, you can buy any dollar amount like $17 or whatever, and pay a minimal fee. You may wait a tad longer than average, but it'll arrive. If you're just looking to get started to see what the fuss is about, you're best starting off with a relatively insignificant amount in case things go wrong.
The quickest way to get started would be to find the closest [Bitcoin ATM]( - the fees are a tad high when compared to Coinbase or other exchanges but you're looking at ATM-convenience, dealing with cash, and usually no ID required below a certain threshold. Transactions take less than 5 min, take your time with it though, make sure addresses are correct, etc.
You can also use exchanges, but you need to go through a verification process that can take days. Use whichever route suits your situation best, there's not a single, "best" option. Think of all Bitcoin services in totality as a Swiss army knife - use what best suits the situation/need.

The same Josh from Butterfly Labs? What a surprise.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:34:55
Your best bet is to move the majority of your holdings off Coinbase - you do not own your Bitcoin while storing it in Coinbase because you do not control the private keys.
A popular desktop wallet is Electrum, which allows you to control your private keys, and they plan on letting users choose which block chain to follow in terms of BIP 148.
I'd consider moving your funds to a wallet you have actual control over and going from there, you don't need to use Coinbase for anything besides buying/selling. In fact right now it's kind of inadvisable to use them for even that, but everyone's experience varies.
You might consider looking up the closest Bitcoin ATM and using that if practical. You may pay a higher buy/sell fee than Coinbase, but you can deal with cash or card and usually don't need to give ID.

Over time, that limited supply will become even more limited due to lost balances in the form of hardware failures, user error, chaos theory, etc. Whenever any amount is lost, the value of the remaining supply inherently rises.
This doesn't work with *in*flationary currency because you can always replace any lost money, meaning the overall supply's value is arbitrary and as a result, inherently worthless.
At least how I see it anyways, I'm not a pro.

It has nothing to do with intelligence, sorry but get that out of your mind sooner rather than later. Learning Bitcoin is no harder than learning how to use a bank account. In many ways it's simpler.
The Internet took a while to catch on, but when it did it caught on like wildfire. I think that we're currently in the very very early stages of mass adoption, all we need is a *really smooth* user interface that isn't rife with locked accounts, canceled transaction, and unresponsive support (looking at you, Coinbase).
Basically, we need people to keep their heads on straight and stop fucking each other over long enough for the average person to understand the freedoms that Bitcoin provides. All the technology is here, it's just people who keep claiming it'll never work that hold newcomers back.

I like using Bitcoin ATMs, they take cash and usually don't require any ID if you buy below a certain amount per visit. Fees can be relatively higher, but remember that you're literally using an ATM to buy/sell, instead of dealing with exchange bullshit.
Some of them also support altcoins (Litecoin, Ether, etc), if that's your cup of tea.

Please explain your point of view instead of making baseless claims. One does not need to be proficient at cryptology in order to send or receive a Bitcoin transaction.

Okay, well as with any new technology it takes time for word to get out. The Internet wasn't in its current state the moment it was released - it was slowly improved upon. Please expect the same to happen with Bitcoin. 
People have known about it in a very vague sense - tied to ransoms, drugs, etc...but now it's getting legitimate recognition, from a lot of big names including existing financial institutions. I would expect that as more and more people eventually hear about Bitcoin, more and more people will eventually seek out more information on it. 
But maybe I'm just insane, right? The fact that it isn't perfect *NOW* means that it never will improve or spread, right?
You guys have got to be fucking joking...please tell me you're all hanging out at one of your houses drinking beer and trolling for fun, because there's no way I should have to explain this kind of stuff.

@_date: 2017-06-10 15:32:27
It's about making the transition from physical barter/trade/store of value to digital store of value. We don't need banks, they just make securing your money very convenient. If you have a huge safe in your home that's bolted down, chances are you can be your own fiat bank, and you can insure your safe contents so there's very little difference between self-storage and bank storage, apart from maybe being able to write checks?
With Bitcoin you're taking that same level of control over your digital assets. You are choosing to give up the support and convenience of banks in favor of full financial freedom. You can make your experience as convenient or as secure as you want, there are better and better tools being developed that make both possible, you no longer have to choose one or the other.
It isn't for everyone, and that's fine. But Bitcoin is just like the Internet...it's technology that isn't going away. Banks will tell you how to use your money - with Bitcoin you can do whatever the fuck you want, but you also have to be willing to take full responsibility for whatever happens...even if you get hacked. 
Welcome to the digital Gold Rush (or so it feels)!

Being able to manage my money however I want, including the use of banks, is important to me personally. Others may feel differently. 
I don't see why Bitcoin needs to succeed or ultimately fail - it can coexist with current financial systems if they leave it alone, but they're trying to control it because they don't want any alternatives. That's the entire driving force behind Bitcoin's creation, breaking away from control when it's not necessary.

I'm all for sitting down and figuring out a solution that works for everyone, but I don't know nearly enough about Bitcoin to consider myself a peer of any developer. It seems that most of the big players are letting their egos do the work, and it's kind of obvious, and really dangerous IMO. Not that I'd be any different, but in my current position where my word doesn't count for much, I feel like anything I say also isn't worth much solely because I'm not a big player. Who has the control?
What's preventing both sides from merging their individual solutions into a single solution? Pride? Money? I'd totally be in support of a plan involving small, easy-to-chew steps that enacts gradual change, giving people plenty of time to figure out what they want.

Why on Earth is Electrum saying I have to pay ~$8-9 to send any amount out? That's nuts.
So if I understand, the "import key" function is not adding the new private key to its database, it's literally sending my balance in a transaction from the original private key to a new address/key pair contained in Breadwallet?
Can I recover the list of private keys containing a balance in case I want to import the keys into another wallet? How does one "break away" from Breadwallet, apart from simply sending their balance out? 
For example I have ~$0.20 worth in a Copay wallet because I can't move the funds into another wallet and Copay doesn't give you the actual private keys for addresses, so I don't want the same thing to happen with Breadwallet.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:24:07
Oh whoa, you're saying that banking systems, which have been around for centuries, are more developed and prevalent in modern society than a new technology that was created around 2010? How startlingly observant of you!
The whole point is that Bitcoin is up and coming...it isn't perfect yet. You must take that into consideration if you want to use Bitcoin.
For what I use Bitcoin for, Bitocin ATMs are literally perfect. I'm sorry your personal hypothetical situation isn't ideal for you, but in practice Bitcoin is far easier to use than any other payment system I've ever come across - literally no signing up, just paying cash and receiving Bitcoin. If that's not simple enough for you, stick to fiat.
You're more concerned with new people getting started, correct? Then help them understand instead of shitting on Bitcoin. I've tried to offer reasons as to why your completely negative impression of Bitcoin is simply not true, but you're pretty set on making Bitcoin out to be negative, or at least inferior to existing, controlled methods.
You gotta figure out why you want to use Bitcoin and go from there - again, it isn't for everyone and that's fine. But don't you dare try to take away from other people's experiences. Offer help if you can, let people decide for themselves.

You have my money for over a year, you better give daily blowjobs as collateral, plus a pinky up the bum. Every. Time.

Bingo, make sure to send me a 5% service fee. Where would you be without me? :P

I've done my stint in IT, it's my fallback, I'm very familiar with how apparently ignorant and idiotic some people can be. PEBKAC *salute*, fellow IT brother.
From the amount of facetime (not the app) I've had with users, it seems that most of that apparent ignorance does in fact come from a total lack of information as to *why* they need to maintain best practices. 
Sure, we can stress that if they don't change their passwords every 30 days someone could gain access to their stuff and potentially ruin their life, but until they actually experience it, or at least see real-world and directly relate-able instances of it happening, they won't take it to heart. I'm a firm believer in live-action drills, not just passing out a pamphlet with a cartoon describing what to do. I would *really* like to see if there's a Bitcoin testnet that new users can use to play around with the entire process, to the extent of their interest.
That's the other thing, Bitcoin isn't going to be for everyone - that doesn't mean that Bitcoin is inherently bad, or deficient, or whatever...and it *certainly* doesn't mean that people who are interested in Bitcoin should be told that it's a bad idea, solely based on your own perception of the situation. 
What it means is that Bitcoin shouldn't, and doesn't have to be forced down anyone's throat. Whoever is interested in using Bitcoin will find the process relatively easy and hassle-free, compared to going to their local bank and going through that whole process. 
They're both fine options, but my overall point in all of this is that it comes down to the individual. If someone doesn't want to use Bitcoin to hold the majority of their savings, that's totally fine, they don't need to know about cryptology or best security practices. Those that do will obviously need to read up on how to protect their savings, because they already *hopefully* understand the responsibility inherent in owning your own wealth. This seems to be the biggest gap that needs to be bridged at the moment...teaching personal responsibility.
It always seems to come down to personal responsibility, oddly enough. I feel that a person doesn't ask for help unless they want it. My plan is to be able to provide that help to the best of my ability, don't know about you. If you provide excellent assistance, chances are they'll have a better chance at understanding what you're trying to teach them, do you agree?

And by the time the craziness subsides they love it and want to go again.

BTC is as alien as people let it be. When you want to learn a bike, do you wallow in your own misery of how complicated it looks, or do you try to ride the goddamned bike?
There's *plenty* of information for anyone to get themselves started - at what point does someone not need their hand held anymore?

Thank you, I should have differentiated between wisdom and intellect. 
I agree, lots of "professionals" think they can weigh in on something they don't fully understand, as if they're simply relying on past achievements to keep their opinions heard.
It's tough to get off a soapbox if you don't see any frowning faces.
