Are you people incapable of understanding the difference between "mocking" and "brigading"?

Nice straw man you got there.

So let's get this straight: You're complaining about someone putting up a false dichotomy between Ancap and the government owning everything, and now you're trying to say the alternative to some impossible "post-scarcity" state is the stone age?

These people are not "knowledgeable". They're usually mediocre ignoramuses elected by morons who vote tribalistically and would just as readily have voted for a cat (or if they're slightly smarter, the ones who happen to be promising them the biggest quantity of handouts). Or they're "experts" appointed by said mediocre people who (via the Dunning Kruger effect) couldn't tell an expert from a conartist anyway.

"Gun deaths" - the disingenuous lumping of suicide, accidents, murder and justifiable homicide into the same category. i.e. it's irrelevant.
It's the homicide rate that ultimately matters and there is no link between that and the gun laws in any country.


I've noticed a pattern alright - people who use "gun deaths" as a proxy for homicide are either liars or too dumb to understand statistics. Either way, not worth taking seriously.
