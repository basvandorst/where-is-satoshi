At least there is something going on in the background of how bitcoin and crypto concurrency works. Gold is mostly used in jewelry. (Some websites through out numbers like ~%80 of consumed gold is used for jewelry).
    
The Swiss vote makes no sense. The value setting by the very elite in the banking world is nearly arbitrary.
  
If you move trends away from gold being desirable in Fashion then the demand for gold drops. I find that funny. I could be wrong, but the thought that gold's value is inflated by fashion is ridiculous.

But those numbers created a month have no bearing on long term stability. Nafta made us trade our ability to manufacture basic goods for life for a service industry doom to fail with growing technology.
@_date: 2016-12-05 01:11:45
You are right in the respect that at the highest levels of sophistication even manufacturing jobs could be replaced with robotics, but service industry jobs are MUCH easier and cheaper to do by machine. Plus the service industry is most likely to tilt at the edge of minimum wage, as as the cost of doing business increases due to payroll it drives incentive for automation sooner than later.
  
US manufacturing output has decreased, but what is interesting is that value of US manufacturing has increased as a result as well. This comes from specialized goods such as those in the medical field that have big dollar value and US manufacturing having the perception of increased quality. But when all is said and done SINCE NAFTA the US number of jobs in manufacturing has decreased as our trade deficit in manufacturing goods has increased. that deficit made many companies shut down as they could not compete on costs.
   
The discussion came up from stabilizing mexico, and the point i made was that the current deal between the US and Mexico makes it hard for Mexico to economically stabilize. Google "negative impact of nafta on mexico" and read the articles before the current election, its startling how many papers were pointing out the truth then but changed their narrative once Trump started to voice the concerns as well.
  
I think Cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be a huge impact on the future of currencies. As it stands now, having so many national currencies makes many of these trade deals close to impossible without them becoming one sided (for a small group within each nation) as value of their local currencies change.

wage is not the same as purchasing power
@_date: 2016-12-05 01:56:12
God look up any article written before Trump ever came into the picture and its the exact opposite. You are reading news that is basically re-writing history to paint trump negatively.

This calculation fails to take into account the real costs of living. Purchasing power is declining as goods, services, vehicles, and homes take up more % of your earnings.

Believe it or not people like to work some people love digging coal as a labor they like to do. There are people that love these jobs and don't want hand outs. I am not against automation, but assuming that automation makes everyone happy is false. The reality of trying to fluff job numbers with the industry most likely to face automation next is a bad economic strategy that has negative consequences in the long term.
  
Costs are artificial when its the same labor being performed by individuals on the different monetary system. Like I said its a currency exchange issue. And even though Mexicans could be paid less the underlying problem is that they are essentially being given more buying power than the workers here at home. They can do more with their money because of this exchange.
  
I myself was laid off as a project manager at one time as the job was shipped to Bratislava. They were paid less, but when you looked up how much it cost locally to go to a movie, buy dinner, shop for milk and eggs, they were able to do more with their money than I could at the higher salary.
  
This is about trade deals with your national interests in mind. The US dollar continues to decline in its buying power as it plays an unfair game with foreign currencies that are valued less but are able to buy more for their citizens.
  
This is one of the reasons why I favor the popularity of cryptocurrencies because I see them as the long term solution to this currency exchange issue, if it ever is adopted or used more than Fiat currency.

You tried to say that the impact of NAFTA is not so bad because we added more jobs, but those jobs have no long term stability which is exactly my point when I said, "bandaid to help public image of politicians that doomed long term economic stability" adding those jobs was not the result of NAFTA  they were bandaids to hiding overall economic stability problem.
  
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:17:38
NAFTA benefited select groups as I stated. If US buying power was increased from it then the cheap goods would matter as a benefit. As it stands, the buying power of the US dollar has continued in its decline. Nafta was a bandaid to help public image of politicians that doomed long term economic stability.
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:22:55
The problem is that most jobs added to the economy in the last 8 years have been mostly service industry jobs which are already coming up in being replaced by advancements in technology.
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:56:21
Just like how less jobs in the US means a worsen economy.
  
The big problem is how NAFTA is negotiated right now doesn't work well for either the US or Mexico especially when it comes to farm subsidies that also put the average farmer in the US out of business compared to commercial enterprises of a smaller group that heavily benefits from subsidies.
  
Farmers in general in the US and Mexico would benefit if subsidies did not give a few unfair advantages in the market.

I am not a super fan of bitcoin, but if bitcoin popularity reduces price of Gold so it can be used more readily for science that would be great.
