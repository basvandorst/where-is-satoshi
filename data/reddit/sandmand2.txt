Young people are desperate to acquire property and build a retirement. They feel time passing by and think that before long it will be too late. To them this looks like the best opportunity to make it big and they’re willing to go all in on it. Unfortunately most of them are doomed.

I have researched it somewhat thoroughly. The bottom line for me is that 95% of all bitcoins are held by 4% of the people with bitcoins, and it’s incredibly subject to price manipulation. The whole pump and dump theory applies. I believe the US government will regulate heavily against bitcoin once it will not be harmful to US financial interests to do so. But I’m reserving final judgment. The first batch of bitcoin futures come due at market close today, so we’ll see how that pans out.

I’m absolutely positively convinced that bitcoin will be worth $1 million a piece by the end of 2020.

Go for it genius.

Is this an advertisement on how shitty your life can turn out if you invest in bitcoin? I might be missing the point.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:56:36
Exactly. The market always bottoms out when you’re sleeping. Change your schedule and start buying.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:42:58
100% percent chance this is trolling.

You’re rich!

Annually, right?

I figure most of you think that buying bitcoin is an investment.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:07:46
If you lose 25% and then gain 25% you are not even...
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:19:08
So you break even if it goes back to $10,000.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:52:22
Crazy would be a compliment.

Deathcross

Yes, imagine a currency where one person has all of it. Sounds incredibly useful.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:36:39
He wants you to buy an investment that just hit its death cross.
