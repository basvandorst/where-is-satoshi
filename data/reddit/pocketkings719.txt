I really hope to see Bitcoin tips spread to other platforms. This would be a cool tool to be able to use on Facebook (which I know is coming) as well as forum software. If this could be integrated into Xenforo, PHPBb, etc, I think those sorts of communities would benefit greatly. More specifically, I think Bitcoin in general has a great place in game servers for those who run it. For example, I run a Minecraft server and will soon be offering donations with Bitcoin to pay for server costs. I'm not sure people will use it, but it is nice to be able to offer that without having to use a service like Buycraft and only have access to PayPal or other payment providers who charge so much off the top for a donation. Thanks for all the awesome Bitcoin community!

That is quite fun! Thank you for the experience, I hope this comes to more platforms soon.

I was not close enough to do a cryptofistbump without is becoming awkward. At this time, I really don't have a desire to spend my BTC, so I did not ask for it.

I'd like just a tip, just to see if I like it.

Forgive my ignorance about Waffle House, I recently moved to an area that has them and this was my first visit. But I don't think this conversation would be limited to Waffle House. I suspect that this type of conversation happens in a lot of places.
