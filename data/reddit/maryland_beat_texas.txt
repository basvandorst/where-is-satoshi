I mean I bought in at lower price a couple weeks back so I'm doing alright but I've been waiting to buy the dip and now I can't it seems.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:19:25
That's his point. Bitcoin was designed to be a currency that's actively used, but everyone is just holding it as an investment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:02:39
It's just a dip, it will go back up don't worry.

Just make sure you come here for the memes and excitement and not actual analysis and you'll be fine.

He's literally just pulling numbers out of his ass like most people on this sub.
At this point who knows how high it can go though?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:23:32
Nobody knows and if people quote you numbers they're pulling them out of their asses.

If I deposit cash into my coinbase account using a card, will it go in instantly? And if I transfer that cash from my coinbase account to my GDAX account, will that occur instantly?
Also is there any way to use a card to deposit cash onto GDAX?

Literally tried to buy at 8900 and the button wouldn't fucking work. Now about to cross back to 10k. Get fucked coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:57:26
It was literally at 8900 earlier today, quit your bullshit

It is a bubble, but that doesn't mean you can't make some money off of it before it pops and stabilizes.

That kind of recklessness will bite you in the ass someday and ruin your life. I hope you're young your life savings was like $500.

I'm not sure why GDAX requires you to first have USD deposited into your account before you can buy... I bought on coinbase before and I want to buy on GDAX now but I don't want to wait another 5 business days just to get USD into my GDAX account so I can THEN buy BTC.

Theres a massive fucking middle ground between "risk averse" and "I dumped my life savings into an extremely volatile investment a week after hearing about it". He got lucky once, he'd be smart to never try that again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:28:15
I would avoid Bitfinex due to their association with Tether, which you can do a subreddit search for to read more about.
Coinbase is considered the most user friendly but GDAX has the lowest fees if you plan on frequent trading.

If you use your bank account to purchase on coinbase, it will take several business days for you to receive your coins. However, the price is locked in to what you buy it at today.
Example: If I buy 1 bitcoin today for $10,000, but that bitcoin doesn't arrive until next week, at which time the price of BTC is $15,000, I still get my bitcoin for $10,000.

GDAX is owned by coinbase, maybe that's why.
Every exchange has it's pros and cons, in my non-expert opinion the exchange you pick will not affect your investment success, it all depends on your individual buy and sell decisions. If you're a beginner I'd recommend probably starting with coinbase and going from there, but I'd say if you're really worried about it do some research, watch some videos, etc and you can feel out which is the best fit for your plan.


If a major exchange ever crashes like MtGox does again it will severely impact the whole market, I don't think being on a particular exchange would make a difference there unless yours was the one that crashed. If you're investing any significant amount of money you shouldn't be keeping your coins on the exchange anyways, you should put them into a wallet.

You're making a lot of assumptions and jumping to a lot of conclusions about me based on the simple idea that pouring your life-savings into an investment you have limited knowledge of is is a bad idea.
That's a nice speech you have there but someone making a poor financial decision that happens to pay off with a massive gain doesn't make them a fucking visionary.


TIL not dumping an entire life savings into one investment is "nay-saying".


What attitude would that be? Again, giving reasonable financial advice that going all in on one investment that is unproven will ruin your life 99% of the time?


I never said anything about when to sell or if it was a good or bad idea to sell at any particular point, so I'm not sure where the fuck you pulled this out from, must've been your ass. My philosophy regarding cryptos is almost always in favor of holding so again you're just making baseless assumptions off of me making a completely reasonable comment.
If you ***really*** think what that dude did was actually a smart move I encourage you to do it a few times yourself and enjoy the rest of your life at the homeless shelter.
I don't knock on people who took a big risk with BTC and made loads off of it. I'm glad there are people who had great success and don't fault them at all for it. But that doesn't make your 100% results-based analysis any less wrong and it doesn't make every person who went all-in on bitcoin and happened to have it work out some kind of financial pioneer, and that's one of the most frustrating aspects of this community because people hit big on one investment and suddenly think they're Warren Buffet.

Takes time for the process to go through the banks and whatnot... don't worry, whatever price you buy at, it's locked in at that price. If you buy at 10k right now and it's 20k when you get your coins, you still get them at the 10k price.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:41:45
That's just your opinion. There's enough there that I personally see no reason to risk it.
