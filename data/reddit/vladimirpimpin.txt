Yes, but it's arrogance backed by things like nuclear silos, aircraft carriers, strategic bombers, omnious surveillance systems, political manipulations, and so on. 
The moment deep space aliens come, that arrogance will burst alongside the USD. Until then, it's PoF all the way

Now check it after factoring in the majority party in Congress (Congress has the "Power of the Purse") as well as removing the effects of inflation from that. And also plot it against GDP while you're at it, I figure that'll probably help paint a better picture.

Effectively get a loan in order to buy more. Personally adding that much additional risk into crypto is insanity in my book unless you're going to buy &amp; hold and/or are absolutely convinced you've got a winner

If I'm understanding things correctly though, the whole point of Bitcoin is it will stay in that 1995 level of tech. A better analogy would be to compare blockchain tech overall to email
