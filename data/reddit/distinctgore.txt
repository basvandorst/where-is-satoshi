Those are mutually exclusive. The problem with crypto is that no one uses it. Stop being an idiot.

The show was in your lap mate. Focus on what’s important in life.

Currently there is too much speculation on bitcoin, and not enough investment based on its validity as a technology and currency. Hell, most of this subreddit is filled with memes about going to the moon and hodling rather than discussions about the technology itself and whether it is a good investment based on its actual usefulness.

Do you mean a block trade? I don’t see how OTC trades would help in this situation.

What I said has nothing to do with the stock market, but I clearly touched a nerve with you regarding Trump. I was just comparing how these guys fooled a number of people in to supporting their shitty cause, just like Trump did. No need to go on the personal defence.

I thought the great thing about Bitcoin is how decentralized and deregulated it is? I have no horse in the race, and I own no crypto-currencies. However I can't help but notice quite a lot of irony in many posts on when people call for what is almost the definition of regulatory oversight, but then becoming highly aggressive when the topic of increased regulation comes up.

Just look at Trump, he fooled the majority of the US.

I thought Bitcoin couldn't be compared to gold because it has no intrinsic qualities that provide value.
