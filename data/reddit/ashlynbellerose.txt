Last time I sold some altcoins like not even 5 minutes later it started to climb and i was looking for hidden cameras to see if the world was playing a joke on me.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:16:13
"you didn't ask. you cross-posted from r/btc to troll us. Bye felicia."
No idea what i even posted and when i tried to get to the bottom of it i got this message.
"You have been temporarily muted from r/litecoin. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/litecoin for 72 hours."
MODs are really sensitive there and probably lost all their money so had to take it out on someone.I dumped all my LTC anyway so im not even that bothered.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:51:30
Is this for real? should I take my money out of coinbase?
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:18:43
How many did you buy out of interest.
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:35:48
Did Charlie Lee sell all his litecoins. When I asked the admin why he banned me he called me Felicia and muted me for 72 hours.Kinda childish. Kinda weird.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:46:26

Those QUBIT chips looking scary tho.
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:17:31
Stop watching infowars,its not healthy for you.
@_date: 2019-09-17 22:13:00
I'm not gonna grin and bear it because it was not the initial purpose of bitcoin.The whales have won and bitcoin and cryptos in general are becoming only for the super rich.Why would the average person want to use bitcoin? There is no point for them.Would you want your salary to be paid in bitcoin knowing today it's worth 10K and tomorrow its lost 10-20 percent its value. No the average person has no use for bitcoin and if it stays on this path of up and down because whales are chipping at it each dump then it just becomes useless.
But you have to trust third parties with large amounts of money to buy and sell bitcoin and if you aren't paying tax on sale you're actually breaking the law. I hope you haven't dumped all your money into BTC especially with large iASICs  and quantum computing rearing its ugly head.oh and don't forget that 0x0000..... Merkel key. F that.
 Dont forget all software can be broken,eventually. Remember dogecoins 100 million coin break.that supply is now infinite,what if that happens with BTC? 
Do what makes you happy I guess but i would suggest building your own crypto from BTC source or even LTC like I did . Once you do that you will realise how vulnerable it really is.For fun build your own from LTC and see how fcked it is.
I'm holding a few just to see and I'm thankful what BTC and LTC did for me in my life but it's no longer worth it anymore.All it takes is a bill to be passed,a bug that breaks the blockchain or a QCPU to RIP through privkeys for it all to be over. 
Soon a bill will be passed that'll devalue cryptos rapidly.probably next year,2020.
Anyways that's all xoxo
@_date: 2019-09-17 22:42:15
Once QBITS hit a certain peak it will break bitcoin.It rips through prime number hashing faster than L-CACHE does 2000 fold and that was at like 40 QBITS. Google now has 72 QBITS and who knows what they will have in 10-20 years.
Also the US Government/CIA. They can make bitcoin look like it's for drug dealers,scammers,firearm dealers and terrorists and what if they make it illegal.Unless you get the right people into Government bitcoin could be made illegal.
A few years ago when I was young I was like "yeah bitcoin it's cool ect" but now I'm older I'm very weiry of its future.As soon as the US Government gets there claws into it and becomes illegal to trade its value becomes worthless.
Also keep in mind it's software,software can be broken eventually.
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:23:05
Bitcoin serves no purpose other than make whales whaleier ?
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:16:32
Nope. I've never lost with cryptos but I don't see a point in it anymore. I've saved a few BTC and LTC only to see what happens in the future but right now I feel like this whole crypto thing is a pointless waste of time. There is no practical application for it other than the rich making poor people poorer and making poor people think they will get rich from it. I just don't see a point in it anymore that's all.id rather spend my time and money on something else. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:59:52
Get me one in hot pink I'll pay later,promise.
