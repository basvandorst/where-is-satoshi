I don't know how young they are, but if they're 10 years away from college I guarantee you college will be a waste of money by then, if it isn't already. If it's still around, it's also gonna be a hell of a lot more expensive than $150k÷2. Some are like $50k/year.

The leaders of the two projects are in a mattermost chatroom. Go to decstack.com, scroll down and click "join our mattermost server" and make an account. There should be three tiny boxes on the top left that say Cicada, Decstack, and Projects, which each have multiple channels within them. Cicada is the first project and is lead by a writer for Hackernoon, Daniel Jeffries. His screenname is laughingmonkey. In the Projects box there is a channel for Brightside, the second project that is working on developing a way to decentralize identity. Getting to the channels is a little confusing, since the Decstack section has a channel named Projects and the Projects section (not channel) has a channel named Cicada, but you'll probably get it.

Transaction fees aren't unfixable, as we've seen with segwit. Let's see what happens with the Lightning Network before we say it's unfixable.
Energy usage? Pff, it costs 10% of your mining income to pay for electricity. Climate change due to energy usage? Renewables. Solar. Look at Envion -- they're placing shipping containers full of miners next to large solar farms.
Validation waits: Lightning Network. We'll see.
Wallet protection: The only difference between my bank account and my bitcoin account is that I *want* to take the risk and hold my bitcoin instead of someone else. A broker offered to sell my grandpa bitcoin, which I'm sure the broker would have held on to. Old people can get in it, too, without knowing the technology.
Exchange with existing monetary infrastructure: Anonymous currency won't replace many aspects of fiat until a decentralized system of identification online is developed, because you can't hold a bitcoin wallet owner accountable for not paying back debt. All credit and debt-related infrastructure will therefore remain until this is developed. I know of two projects currently working on decentralized identification without relying on biometrics; comment if you want to know more.
Another thing about exchange with existing monetary infrastructure: Most of this infrastructure only exists in the developed and developing countries. The only infrastructure needed for bitcoin is a smartphone, electricity, and internet access. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are independently trying to put wifi all over the planet, with solar drones and satellites respectively. Over 100,000 new people are gaining access to electricity every day. The places that have the most work to do are actually the places with infrastructure.

you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about... selling dollars is the same as selling bitcoin. yes, you can sell dollars. you can sell them for euros or bitcoin. and you can spend bitcoin just like you can spend cash. selling and spending aren't different. you can sell dollars. also, what you sell someone else buys, so when someone *trades* 1 million bitcoins, nothing happens to the market cap unless they *trade* it for above or below the current price. Trading at the current price doesn't affect the current price. Trading for higher or lower does. That's demand pushing the price up or down.

I know you were joking and didn't ask for this much detail, but I have to impart this wonderful knowledge upon my people: Since we're progressing in this field exponentially over time, we'll be able to wake you up around or shortly after 2045, which is when the technological singularity is supposed to take place (AI becoming godlike in intelligence, being able to solve any problem not provably mathematically unsolvable or deemed impossible due to the laws of physics). Sometimes I wish I could just be cryothanized right now tbh, knowing that I can easily get killed by a drunk driver and especially after seeing that daniel shaver video that went viral yesterday. I don't feel safe in this time in history. My brain can't decay in a frozen coffin and once I'm woken up and my mind is uploaded into a computer I'll be effectively immortal. You can argue that we'll kill ourselves with nuclear war or climate change, but once mind uploading is invented and allowed to the public, the Internet would have to permanently die in order for me to die, and we all know that won't happen.

I'm here because I want to secure a share of the future's most valuable asset\(s\) while there are still only 2 billion people connected to the internet and not 2 quadrillion. Millions of wallets as opposed to the future's trillions. I'm willing to bet the money I have in crypto \(meaning not take it out\) that I'll be around to see bitcoins being as sought after as blood diamonds. I'm talking about transhumanism, radical life extension, and mind uploading of course. It's certainly a challenge in patience, but I'm convinced it would be worth it.

So I was told by someone online who I thought was knowledgeable about the subject that Monero was the most ASIC\-resistant coin \(clearly not\) because it utilized CPU mining. They said that if a company made more efficient CPUs it would be a major breakthrough in the field of computing and they would make way more money selling the design or CPUs to a major hardware manufacturer to put in their computers. Like, billions he implied. So he said Monero mining was destined to be restricted to CPUs and was the most fairly distributed and ASIC\-resistant coin. Guess he didn't know what he was talking about, but I was wondering if it's possible to make a coin like that? The article implies not.

This is so true and no one here realizes it. If you've seen Kurzgesagt's recent videos on stopping aging, you know that millennials are likely to live millennia. Then if you're willing to take it a step further and believe Ray Kurzweil's idea that we'll upload our minds to computers and live for as long as the internet does (which could very well be the entire duration of the Universe if artificial superintelligence doesn't kill us), bitcoin will be the supreme ruler of this interstellar economy. You have to look at it as if we've been born *before* everyone, because, as futurist, physicist, and YouTuber Isaac Arthur has explained on his channel, the Earth, if disassembled and reassembled to optimize living space could house a quadrillion people. Assuming 2 million people use bitcoin right now, with a fixed supply the demand (and therefore price) will be multiplied by (1 quadrillion÷2 million=**half a billion**). This means in the far future bitcoins could be worth 5 trillion dollars each. And that's just the Earth. Forget about Dyson swarms, or even worse, Matryoshka brains. If we can fit the current human race, if digitally uploaded, on a computer the size of a coke bottle, according to Isaac Arthur, how much demand will a Matryoshka brain have for bitcoins? This is what I think about when everyone talks about buying Lambos. I think about buying solar systems, because I know I'll be around for that. Unless I get hit by a bus. But if I get ALS or terminal cancer I'm totally Hal Finneying.

no, prohashing and nicehash are multipools meaning your miner mines all different types of coins (for L3+ it would mine all scrypt coins, for example, like litecoin, gamecredits, and bitconnect coin but there are a lot). It switches to mine the most profitable one at any given time. It's more profitable

yeah I know the feeling, because a while ago (bitcoin was ~2k) I almost sent 3.5 bitcoins to a litecoin address. It came to 8k. I actually went through with the transaction on bitfinex and then noticed when I x'd out of the window that my trezor was showing my litecoin wallet.

That is definitely enough to live off of. You can easily get 5% interest on what's left after you buy that $300k house. That's 75k a year. Like... that's plenty for a family to live off of man -.-
Also regarding buying a house in cash, mortgages are just renting money. If you're not going to use that money to make more money, buy it in cash. But if you can get a higher return investing it than you will save by buying it in cash, then get a mortgage. Tbh, they'll probably be about the same rates so it won't matter much anyway.

use a calculator to see the profit. The S9 makes more money, is cheaper, and will retain its probability for longer (it's literally better in every way) but they're not available from bitmain right now because they ran out. Give them a few days to a week, though, and there will be more in stock. The L3+ is the next best miner but I wouldn't suggest it, as the profit will drop faster than that of the S9.
Either way search "nicehash calculator" and plug in the specs to see how much money they make. S9 should be like $18/day and L3+ $15/day.

@_date: 2017-09-23 11:48:59
This isn't a better analogy. The point OP is trying to make is that bitcoin fundamentally undermines fiat money and the global banking cartel. JP Morgan would become obsolete in a crypto-dominated world. No one would need them. Currently, they are the largest bank in the world, with 2.5 trillion in assets. The only way Dimon can make money off bitcoin is by using his position in the finance world to manipulate the market, which is actually too big for him to. The recent crash was because of China shutting down Chinese exchanges.

what?... how is the military supposed to break into everyone's houses around the world to shut down all the miners? It's not about allowing bitcoin to topple world governments; it's about the dollar's value slowly dropping out of existence because of the existence of a far superior currency. Money is power, and bitcoin is the epitome of money. Expecting cryptocurrencies to settle at a comfortable place and stop growing or grow slowly is like expecting the internet to do the same. The military can't bomb bitcoin.

my dad was an executive at an IT company (made ~$300k/year for like 10 years). But they made a lot of money on the houses we lived in because of the real estate market. Then the bubble burst and we've been stuck with our latest house for longer than we wanted. Now, though, my parents bought a bed and breakfast and increased the profit by like 100% in the past two years. At a cap rate of 8%, that increases the worth of the business 12.5x for every dollar of profit you add. So they went from a 4.4 million dollar business that makes 400k before our 250k bnb mortgage (so 150k profit. Still not enough to pay our house's mortgage lol but my grandpa worked in a factory for decades and my grandma took advantage of compounded interest... they reached the end of their lives with $1 million dollars in the bank that my parents use to supplement our income and stay afloat. we're trying to sell the current house). Anyway yeah, so take the 400k profit business (we only make 150k from it but that doesn't make a difference to the value of the business) and add 150k. 550k profit is what someone would make if they bought it from us in cash. with an 8% cap rate, though, that's 550k/.08=6.8 mill. So in two years, they made the business worth 2.4 million more. We weren't planning to sell it, but if they keep this pace up (which they can't because there is only so much you can squeeze out of the business before you need like robot staff that doesn't need to get paid or something lol), they might be able to make the business worth 9 million by 2019. Then they can sell it, put 10% down on a 40 million dollar hotel that brings in 4 mill before mortgage. And so on and so on to the moon :P that's the power of the exponential.

Shutting down US exchanges is possible, but there are exchanges in other countries. If they banned those websites, you could just use a VPN. Yes, it's more difficult and less people would be able to do it. Already people find bitcoin difficult to buy, but they'll learn.
There are two reasons I think bitcoin is a better currency than the dollar. The first compares two extremely unlikely doomsday scenarios, and those are whether the dollar can become worthless or bitcoin (not quite doomsday but eventually could be) can become worthless. If there one day becomes a grand conspiracy of some shadow government hoarding all the gold in the treasury and fort knox, and the US decides that all debts, public and private, must be paid in gold, the dollar becomes worth zero overnight. All outstanding loans need to be paid back in gold, and no one will sell you gold for cash because they can't use the cash to pay back their own loans. Because they have no gold, the banks will default on their loans, one of which is your bank account (you loaned them money remember?). If you had bitcoin, however, we all know that would still be valuable, and extremely valuable at that. The other scenario is that everyone stops recognizing bitcoin as a form of payment. That can't happen because the blockchain is intrinsically valuable as a universally agreed upon ledger. Bitcoin will always be valuable. There is one way to shut down bitcoin, and that's to shut down the miners. There are too many miners in every corner of the world for that to happen. The entire internet would have to be shut down.
An extra one I forgot is counterfeiting. Dollars can be counterfeited, but bitcoin can't be unless there is a 51% attack. No one has 51% of the hashing power, though. You can even buy counterfeit dollars on the deep web for bitcoin.

They cannot provide any way to store your bitcoin that is different from the ways you can. You don't need to keep your money in a bank. This means they can't loan out 90% of your bitcoin like they can your cash. Bitcoin can't be taken back by force -- no matter how many nuclear bombs you have at your disposal.
The US may be strong, but do you really think it's stronger than the internet, with all its corruption in the finance industry? Will people *really* be as faithful in our government as they will be in bitcoin when another crisis happens and bitcoin surges in price?
You're right, JP Morgan isn't the biggest bank, my mistake. JP Morgan is the biggest US bank and the biggest bank that can borrow directly from the Federal Reserve. They're the biggest entity that can create dollars from thin air to lend, and they do it. They are a for-profit private (as in not government) company that lends *taxpayer money* to the taxpayers so they can make an interest. They take your money and lend it back to you while charging you interest. Corrupt. Bitcoin cannot be corrupted. You talk about how much money and military strength the US has, but even politicians and soldiers get paid in dollars and the dollar is declining. Do you think bitcoin will do [this](

Bitcoin is a new form of value. Ethereum is a form of value *funding* the creation of other forms of value (ICOs), just like any other industry. Profits lead to innovations, which lead to more profit. It's a snowball; bitcoin's existence increased the growth rate of the world economy. You forget that bitcoin's value isn't measured in its market cap. I don't know how to quantify it, maybe an economics phd knows how to, but bitcoin is worth much more to society than $65 Billion

I think you are misunderstanding how blockchain-based money is different than every single other investment vehicle in history. It is indeed a currency, but it's backed by something more powerful a government: the miners. They are motivated by profit (in the form of bitcoin of course), and as long as bitcoin is valuable, people will keep mining, keeping the network strong. The stronger the network, the more demand there is for bitcoin. The more demand there is for bitcoin, the stronger the network. Banks can't use bitcoin to their advantage -- no one needs a bank to use bitcoin, and if bitcoin overtakes the dollar, no one needs banks (that includes the world's biggest bank: JP Morgan).

Bitcoin's supply is mostly increasing, with some coins being lost and a smidgin being burned. The biggest point about supply is that its max is finite. I do think demand is increasing exponentially, though, but on two layers. One is the fact that the population is increasing exponentially and the other is the fact that not everyone in the world uses bitcoin. The second one will hit a wall, of course, but it's still valuable untapped demand. Those are the two most predictable massive areas for exponential growth as far as I can see.

My dad lost 200k in the stock market because my mom finally let him start trading... right before the great recession. Money is hard to make in the beginning, but money makes money. Every thousand gets easier and easier if you know what you're doing. My parents were raised in pretty poor/bad/uneducated areas and in my mom's 20s she even had to walk away from a condo she bought and went bankrupt. Eventually, though, and only a couple years after they had their first kid (I was 1 year old), we escaped to a beautiful and really *really* rich town. We kept going up and up and now in their 50s they've turned a 4 million dollar business into an 8 million dollar business in 2 years. They could take that profit, put 10% down on a 40 million dollar business, and if they do the same in 2 years... but they won't because their current business is their dream (one can only hope they continue the trend, though, lol. That's my dream)

the carrying capacity of the earth is [a lot higher]( than people realize. Not sure where it is in the video but this guy talks about how earth, if utilized as efficiently as possible, could support upwards of a quadrillion people. I believe mind uploading is possible, too, and provides continuity of consciousness, so I'm a fan of the idea of those quadrillion people fitting inside a supercomputer... and then building thousand foot high supercomputers all over the planet and under it and above it and where the fuck ever. That's a lot of people. Of course, it would be more likely that these people would merge consciousnesses, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Since technology is progressing exponentially (it is, believe it or not. Total human knowledge is also increasing exponentially), we will achieve this kind of civilization within our lifetimes.

ASICs are spread out all over the planet and a lot are in China. The US would have to engineer billions of dollars worth of significantly better ASICs and keep them all to themselves for mining.
Actually I did some calculations. The current hashrate of the bitcoin network is 21 million Th/s. That equates to 1.5 million Antminer S9s (assuming the 14Th/s batch) and those sell for around $2500. If the US were to flat out buy them, it would cost $3.75 billion to match the current hashrate. However, it obviously costs bitmain much less to make a miner, so let's say it costs $500. They were selling S9s for $1500 at one point, so I doubt it cost $1000 to make. I'm going with $500. In this case, it would only cost $750 million to match the current bitcoin hashrate. These are 16 nanometer chips, though... There is a Japanese company working on 7nm to be released this year and eventually 5nm next year. If the United States bought the company, they would have access to an unlimited supply of chips that are superior to the rest of the world's. I have no idea how much these cost to make but we can guarantee it will be cheaper per Th/s. Maybe it will be 7/16 times the cost? I don't know how this technology works. If that's the case, then it would cost only $328 million to produce the necessary miners to take over bitcoin, excluding the price of buying the company (GMO). If the United States waited to bring all the miners online at once... if sounds possible.
