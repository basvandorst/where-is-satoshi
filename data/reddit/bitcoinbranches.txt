I tried this with my friends, sent about 10 of them a few bucks from coinbase but all of them except one was too lazy to even create an account and claim it.  They are pretty lame.

I got a $10 fee for buying $2 worth of bitcoin with a credit card. I called my credit card company and complained and escalated it to a manager who refunded it for me. They told me that Circle has it set to "cash advance" setting. Whether that's true or not overall I'm very impressed with Circle and they did warn me I might get charged cash advance fee. I may try other credit cards to see if I can find one that won't do charge me.

So why is the price still falling?  Down to $615 now.

I'm new to graphic design, can someone explain how to install and use them in a program like Paint? I tried adding them as a font but it didn't work.

I sent a few bucks to 8 friends to try and get them interested via coinbase and only one actually picked it up. Kinda disappointing how lazy people are but maybe if I handed out $20 worth it would have been different. I'm not that generous though!
