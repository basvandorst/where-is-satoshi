I currently am 50-50 on btc/ltc.  Although it's not over 100k it is over 50k.  I too wonder the same thing.   The LTC subreddit seems to be shrinking in size and I'm hoping it's not losing its momentum.  I think ASICs are very positive in the securing and legitimizing of the network, but I wonder who's working hard to gain ground.  Besides Charlie at Coinbase I just don't know what's in the cards.  Overall I'm personally very optimistic.   But I think we are in for a rough few months as BTC starts to pick up steam.

@_date: 2014-02-15 21:56:35
Less liquidity equals higher volatility.  Bitcoin isn't a ghost town.  The rapid drops in prices aren't occurring as easily because the majority of people holding large amounts of bitcoin are believers and not panic selling when bad news drops.  This is good for news for bitcoin.

I personally think promoting Segwit on Litecoin is the best first step.  The politics have crept in over there, and I believe activating Segwit on Litecoin will help activate it on Bitcoin.  I'm trying and would be will to do whatever I can to activate on Litecoin first.

You want to spend between $2,000-$3000, and you're worried about the $40-$60 premium you'll pay?  
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:31:45
Because Bitcoin has a $15,000,000,000 market cap.  Litecoin has a $200,000,000 market cap.  Why mess around with something so big and valuable when you can test it on a coin with ~1% of Bitcoins value?  Seems dangerous to me.
I for one am in favor of seeing Segwit launch and perform on Litecoin first.  Then, if successful, being activated on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:56:46
That post you made does nothing to prove that Litecoin is a scam.  The difference between SHA256 and Script is negligible and if anything, Scrypt is probably the better of the two due to its efficiency.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:23:39
Great to hear and hope many others do the same.  Don't let the development go to waste.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:27:06
I'm not hating on Bitcoin, but don't see your point in calling Litecoin a scam coin.  Sure the creator changed a few parameters, but certainly not with bad intentions to deserve being called a scamcoin.  Bitcoin is at a crossroads, so let's let Litecoin be a testnet for Segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:15:21
I've done so already in anticipation.  I'm sure a lot of money will be moving into Litecoin in anticipation of deployment.
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:17:08
Let's see it in action on Litecoin first. They have a 200million dollar marketcap, we have a 16billion.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:14:30
Why would you say that?  I think that would help convince miners to switch over and vote Segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:11:30
Why?  I don't understand why the blocks being full would affect the testing on LTC.  I understand we have a testnet, but it has no value.  If there's something wrong with Segwit we will find out because there's a 200 million dollar bounty with LTC.
We will learn the expected increase Segwit effectively provides to the blocksize, and we can perhaps begin building and testing all the other great features on a chain with real value.  I think this is the best approach.  Why risk it on a chain with a $16,000,000,000 value? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:19:57
I did, please articulate a response.  
I loved this part "without the innovation that makes Bitcoin viable as a currency." 
What happens if Litecoin deploys SegWit before Bitcoin?  Do you backtrack and call Bitcoin a scamcoin?  You know, since it'll be lacking innovation?
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:23:33
As is Litecoin.

Unfortunately, miners disagree.  We are a long way off of the 95% threshold needed to activate and don't think we get there unless it can be proven to work on another blockchain.  Thankfully Litecoin is around with a 200 million dollar marketcap and pretty much a Bitcoin clone aside from a few parameters.

I think we are entering a race against marketcap between two teams.  Team BTC &amp; LTC vs. Team ETH &amp; ETC.  I think a big concern was the amount of marketshare ETH has been taking from BTC.  Now we have a coin that we can promote as "The New and Improved BTC" in Litecoin, due to the fact that it is essentially the same coin with none of the problems.  Due to how easy it is to switch between the two, it seems crazy to me to be holding BTC during their scaling issues while LTC is taking the lead, innovation wise.  If/when BTC does figure out how they'll scale, you can easily convert some/all back into BTC.  For now, I own big majority LTC.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:06:47
Here's my list:
1. Coinomi (Shapeshift integration is awesome)
2. Mycelium 
3. Copay (Great for multisig)
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:13:39
I'm of the assumption that BTC doesn't need to scale and can simply be a digital store of value. BTC is not broken nor does it need to be "fixed." I also like the fact that it's a "clone" because any sweet shit that is discovered can be implemented on the other. But hey, I see you're a little upset about LTC. I'm not sure why because both sides should be on a team. Anyway, I see LTC serving as a payment network and BTC being a store of value. Feel free to disagree.
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:16:43
You "spend" bitcoin daily, or "send" daily? There's a difference. I personally "send" daily, and if you've ever used LTC you'd understand why it's more convenient.
@_date: 2017-04-27 01:52:57
Why? Litecoin is way more convenient honestly. The only reason not to would be stubbornness.

Luke gets offended by the success of Litecoin. He's made it very clear that he thinks it's a "clone scamcoin." Unfortunately he's in the corner of the minority unwilling to accept his ignorance. Let him bash Litecoin while the majority see his views on the subject as biased.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:41:18
Why is killing ASICBoost a priority at all? Any miner could also implement it, so why not just release a guide so other miners can also use ASICBoost. If all miners used it, then there wouldn't be an edge. I'm opposed to taking an edge away from someone who worked harder and smarter to find it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:06:21
Funny to see the emotion come out from someone so important to the community. Whether or not you think LTC is a scam or not is irrelevant. That is something to be argued about by insignificant reddit trolls. Seems laughable to see you "attempting" to convince the public of your opinion. Personally I'm a maximalist, but am not blinded by the significance of LTC. Happy to see LTC succeed.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:14:26
You keep saying "scamcoin." Please explain the "scam." Fair launch, very secure network, and active development all point to it being the opposite of a scam. There are coins that are scams, but I certainly wouldn't put LTC is that arena. You pushing UASF on BTC seems scamier to me. BTC works and doesn't need to upgrade. It doesn't need to be everything. LTC will be the payment network. A UASF won't happen within 12 months, and probably not even then. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:37:48
Time will tell, unfortunately. Hopefully I'm wrong, but personally I don't think I am.
Before we know it, Ethereum will take the lead. Coincidentally as crypto hits the inflection point and new money starts pouring in. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:47:49
I can say words too.
Attempting a UASF is extremely reckless and shouldn't be attempted. There is nothing wrong with BTC. It functions exactly as it was designed and is a perfect digital gold as is. Payments can be done on any other blockchain, and Litecoin is already in the position to do so. Why are we even taking such a risk?
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:17:07
This article is over a month old?  Is this foreshadowing of some sort?  
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:22:29
You may single handedly be the one individual unable to see the big picture. Ethereum is gaining marketshare. Ripple is gaining marketshare. There is a tipping point before BTC loses its marketshare and money starts flowing into those other coins, as awful as they are. You for some reason continue to call LTC a "scam" instead of an "improved BTC testnet." I hate to break it to you, but BIP 148 is not going to happen. It's frustrating to see someone as "informed" as you be so blind by the big picture. I get you're a developer and have "principles," but you're emotional attachment to BTC is hindering your sense of rationality.
This should be the BTC/LTC camp vs the ETH/ETC/XRP/(everyone else) camp. Once/if another coin takes over BTCs marketcap, it's only a matter of time until BTCs money starts pouring into the "new" number 1 coin. After that, well, we are on the verge of finding out.
So, don't get your hopes up, but BIP 148 is not the answer. BTC will not scale, and that's okay. It's amazing as is. Promote LTC as the payment network and let LTC regain ETH/XRP/(every other coin) marketshare. It should be the BTC &amp; LTC show. The gap is closing very quickly.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:17:30
Luke doesn't like Litecoin. Luke calls Litecoin a "scamcoin." Some things will never change. He will never back it up with legitimate fact, just his personal opinion. Unfortunately, it's hard to trust someone who does this, and simultaneously​ preaches bip148 as a savior. If he think Litecoin is a scamcoin, when it clearly isn't, how can I trust his input on UASF?
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:00:47
Fair, but LukeJr is a current threat to Bitcoin. His fear mongering war talk tactics are not the way to upgrade bitcoin. Bitcoin requires consensus.
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:57:51
The community has chosen to? As I user I am opposed to BIP148 UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:50:41
At these prices and profit margins for miners, it's only a matter of time until more competition enters the space.  I don't think a 51% attack is a real threat IMO.  I just don't think we need to rush into a UASF.  I'd prefer to see the whole space rise and take shape rather than rush a UASF out of fear that an alt will "take over" BTC.  I don't think that's a real threat, and don't think there's anything wrong with LTC serving as our payment network.
Agree that immutability and decentralization are important.  Neither of those are at risk unless we increase blocksize, which I'm also opposed against.  I'd prefer BTC to remain unchanged, unless of course, it's a MASF to activate Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:22:16
No, BIP148 is not the only way. It is a reckless way that can split and hurt Bitcoin. LukeJr is using fear mongering propaganda in an attempt to gather BIP148 support. We should be ignoring BIP148 and allow it to be a non event.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:51:29
You aren't required to use BTC to transfer money. Litecoin is an alternative solution. It's faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:17:02
Agreed. I for one don't understand the rush? I certainly won't be holding LukeJrCoin. Bitcoin upgrades should be on a "do not harm Bitcoin" basis, not a "let's upgrade as quickly as possible" basis. Everyone needs to settle down and have some patience.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:27:29
Yes this should be priority number 1.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:58:14
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:23:25

Nearly the reach? Don't know what you mean by that. As far as sending funds, LTC is a better alternative than BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:41:15
BIP148 has very little support. It is reckless and dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:32:42
Agreed. It's frustrating to see LukeJr vehemently posting ridiculous propoganda on Twitter. If I see the words "it's happening" again I'll scream. As of now, it's a non event, and he keeps pretending like we all need to get on board or else there's a split. We should all be standing down to avoid it becoming anything more than a non event.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:55:01
Enjoy your LukeJrCoin
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:54:46
Bitcoin has value because it is both scarce and usable. Nothing will change those two things, so it will always have value. Whether or not it remains stagnant is irrelevant. The fact that it is nearly impossible to change is a feature. Bitcoin will be digital gold regardless of whether or not it gets Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:10:48
This would be a great result. The dangers of BIP148 are too great to risk it. A "do not harm bitcoin"​ approach should be taken. We should absolutely avoid a "rushed" "let's activate as fast as we can" approach. Segwit is worth being patient for.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:52:16
LukeJr is a threat to Bitcoin. His fear mongering propaganda should not be tolerated here. We all want Segwit, but let's have some patience. This is not a war. BIP148 is not the solution.
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:16:07
No it won't.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:49:33
That's what makes it great. It is essentially an improved bitcoin. When it reaches current Bitcoin levels, scaling won't be a problem because it has Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:56:04
No, having patience and finding another way to upgrade is the other option. Not rushing and risking a split in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:22:49
What's the rush? Is Bitcoin broken?
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:27:36
Because most devs correctly hold Bitcoin to a higher standard. Bitcoin upgrades should occur only on a no harm to bitcoin basis. For some reason LukeJr wants to upgrade "as fast as possible" with no regard to Bitcoin. BIP148 is reckless and dangerous.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:24:07
Bold huh? I like it.
