MoneyGram and Western Union don't let you send cash from the UK to a South African bank account.
It needs to be BANK 2 BANK not cash.
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:54:17
It was BANK 2 BANK so it had to be a transfer which is not possible with Western Union as I checked it.

Litecoin - MEH! - The only other coins which have any value is RIPPLE and STELLAR and at a push namecoin.
The other little benefits of the other altcoins could be implemented into Bitcoin very easily.
RIPPLE has partnered with a major German bank it should be worth a little more.

Are you seriously that dumb? Why would anyone try to compare "Silicon Valley CEO" to "Bitcoin CEO".
Silicon Valley is a place for starters and home to some of the worlds largest tech companies and is recognised world wide where as Bitcoin is fairly new in comparison.
Why are you so against a bad headline, 
@_date: 2016-07-15 15:39:36
Meh thats like saying "INTERNET CEO" "Milk CEO" "EGG CEO" "JEANS CEO" makes zero sense and is confusing to NEW people reading about Bitcoin.

Journalists are supposed to throughly research stories, follow journalism ethics, standards and principles.
If they can't get one of the fundamentals of Bitcoin correct e.g decentralization.... by stating Bitcoin has a CEO then they have not fact checked.
This isn't TMZ or ShowBiz monthly.
So if you can tell me with a straight face that people new to digital currency would not find the headline "Bitcoin CEO released on bail in embezzlement case" negatively then your beyond help.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:31:19
I think it great because it allows the older generation to invest into Bitcoin, the non tech savvy.
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:54:39
What does that have to do with the price of fish?
How can you compare "Sundar Pichai a Silicon Valley CEO" to "Bitcoin CEO released on bail in embezzlement case"
The title should include "mtgox ceo"
