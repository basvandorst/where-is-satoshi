what is stopping you? :)
read the label and do the math on how much THC you want in the final product. Substitute part of the oil in the recipe with the magic oil. 
Make sure you consume the end result safely and clearly label and/or secure them if you don’t live alone. Especially pay attention if there is even a remote possibility a kid is going to be around these.

that escalated quickly.

you don’t need much to get into it. to be profitable? you need to know a lot and probably be in specific geographies with cheap power and have special hardware.
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:20:06
guessing that it time no matter when you bought it you will turn a profit if you hodl

if prediction is wrong mcafee is gonna eat his own dick
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:47:02
aren’t we all? 
my point was that in most place the power costs more than the coins you mine. at that point you should just buy the coins and you’re no longer mining- you’re investing

yeah but real estate on the moon is kinda expensive:)

@_date: 2019-04-15 20:37:28

@_date: 2019-04-27 03:09:00
robinhood already supports crypto in some states
@_date: 2019-04-27 04:34:43
different people value different things when it comes to bitcoin. it’s okay if you don’t like RH and how this is done.
@_date: 2019-04-27 03:35:25
that’s a purist view. look at the bright side: no transaction fee, you don’t manage the wallet/keys and come tax time you will be happy when someone does the heavy-lifting. 
it’s a good option for some people.

@_date: 2019-05-30 17:39:39
step 1) don’t sell your coins   
step 2) buy more
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:49:05
step 3) ...  
step 4) PROFIT!!!!

put the right transaction out there and waited for the proper miner to capture it in a block
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:17:14
it’s like squeezing your buttocks to divers the blood from your boner in the face of a gold digger
