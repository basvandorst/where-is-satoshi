Quite the squeeze.

You say who cares but a few days later a guy was saying, "should I wait for the bounce to cash out or should I cash out now?"
Out of all the comments I was the only one to give him accurate advice which was that there was no short term bounce and that if he sold out now he'd have a better chance of buying at a lower price. 
Being right is important because there are a lot of people who are new to bitcoin and investing and they are being guided by so many straight out lies on this sub reddit. Being right should be important to you too and its a shame that spinning fairy tales on this sub reddit is so widely accepted.

Do you still think I am wrong?
Because the 6.5k is looking a lot more likely then even a 10k sell at this stage

How do people educate themselves regarding bitcoin when everybody is constantly saying it'll go up since it bounced back down off 14k. We're talking almost 4 months of horrible advice to buy and hodl when the best advice has been to sell. If you sold at 10k and bought in now you'd be up 20%,if you bought in at 9k, you'd be up, if it keeps going down? You might even double your bitcoin if it goes to 5k.
Instead,the advice is to just keep on buying regardless of the price and I think this is fundamentally bad advice.
I am trying to educate people on bitcoin. Instead I have to constantly push against the echo chamber of unrealistic predictions

I don't think bitcoin has the demand it needs to break up and the longer it remains at 9k the more likely a break down to 7k is.

A simple coil resistor is a lot cheaper to manufacture and consumes a lot less resources than a mining rig.
You're also forgetting that this heater might not be on during summer and therefore, not be an efficient heater when the opportunity costs, waste generated and **energy input costs** are all accounted for when comparing a mining heater to a conventional heater.
So also physically equally efficient, in every other metric, its not.

This is a bad move, centralising wealth and value into bitcoin so the fat cats can cash out at a higher price. People complain about market manipulation, this here is market manipulation.
We need competition if this space is mean to grow and this is a huge display of anti-competitive behavior
