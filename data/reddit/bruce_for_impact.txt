Try that somewhere else? Any doctor, the world over, would treat anybody under those circumstances. The usual penalty for not acting is being struck off the medical register in that country. 
Though I doubt you have the brain power to do the above document justice, you should have a look just in case. 
The only difference between America and everywhere else is that only in America, after you had been treated, would there be people sniffing round you, trying to determine how best to part you from an unjustifiable amount of money. That is to say, if it can be proven that you own any assets, they will set about trying to reclaim that money from you. The lack of compassion in the name of profit, is one of the key aspects of America's fall from grace.

It’s looking more and more like a fascist dictatorship

Dear Americans that fit the mental profile of the person above, please get it through your moron skulls that you aren’t subsidising the rest of the world with your brilliance, regardless of how many times you say it. 
All other Americans, as you were, you’re great! 
Also, Alanis Morissette would even be embarrassed by your grasp of irony.

You could do a lot worse for your country than to hire Ms Merkel. Indeed you HAVE done massively worse by putting that orange baby in charge. He even said himself that the world is laughing at America. He got the reasons why we’re laughing wrong but the fact remains. Barack Obama was no angel, but sandwiched between Bush and Trump (two ridiculous names when seen side-by-side) he certainly looks like one now, and he did far more than either of those two cunts to make America better.
