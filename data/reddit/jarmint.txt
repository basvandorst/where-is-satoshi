I used to work for a popular second hand electronics retailer and I had to setup a bitcoin machine similar to that in the Edinburgh store for a 'bitcoin only day'.
Bitcoin seemed rather popular in Scotland

Currently they allow you to buy/sell/trade crypto but only with other Revolut users..

Not sure about PayPal but you can definitely do a simple bank transfer

Revolut are planning to except crypto from outside their network. Worth keeping an eye on.

A colleague at work told me about WireX which seems to work as advertised. I've not checked it out fully yet but it seems promising!

I give you full permission to be weird and go and have a look, when you go to work tomorrow and find out for me.

Wirex or coinbase for example. Other exchanges are available but these two are probably the most user friendly

I think OP wants to know stuff like what currency exchange is best for their country and methods of storing btc.
At least that's the questions I'd be asking.

There are a ton of YouTube videos out there that'll explain things. Just be careful as your investment is at risk!

It's the easiest but not cheapest if you live in the UK
