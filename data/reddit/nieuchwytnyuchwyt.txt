I would say that quite the contrary, considering that the US companies seem to be forbidden from doing business in this occupied by Russia part of Ukraine.

The point is to punish the illegal Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory, regardless of whether this territory is inhabited by Russians or not. It's irrelevant to this case *who* populates Crimea. That's not a justification for invasion under any circumstances.
Sanctions are against *Russia*, even if in this particular case they affect inhabitiants of Crimea the most, whatever their loyalities are. The point is to make this annexion an immensely unprofitable enterprise for everyone involved, and thus discourage any potential similar actions in the future.

Their... inconvenience comes as a collaterall damage. Tough luck they are affected by it, people living in the Generalgouvernement also suffered from the Allied sanctions against Axis during the WW2. Will it be worth it in the end?
Crimea won't become a huge drain for the Russian state *without* sanctions - and sure, it sucks to live in Crimea while it happens. But it will suck even more for *us* all if we will live in a world where it will be seemingly perfectly alright to invade and annex part of the territory of the neighbouring country.
As a citizen of a country bordering Russia, I am very glad that USA imposed such sanctions.

Yes, the part illegally administered by Russia, and will last as long as this state of affairs will continue.
