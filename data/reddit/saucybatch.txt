hmm ok so it does just take some time huh? Thank you so much! If you wouldnt mind... I don't mind upping the fee for the larger transactions I plan on doing so they get processed faster. if I set my wallet to Priority .001015 BTC/kiB ... how do you calculate what the actual fee would be? For example, if I had 6000 USD worth of BTC transferred in... what would that end up costing me?

my app is set to 'normal' .. should i boost it up to the more expensive one then? And is the fee a set fee or is it a percentage of the amount? Thanks for the reply!

Hi James, I pulled that number directly from your app, so it's absolutely something BitPay processed. I have no other wallets. db0ed5b91e285e38175df7bc91fcc3a6369e571000a1c85eb11bd4f43c93aebc
Thank you for the reply but I emailed your support group yesterday and haven't heard anything, so I now have to resort to reddit users for help. Another user easily found the transaction yesterday so not sure why you had problems

Definitely not making me excited to start using BitPay

Hey so the transaction is still uncofirmed and it's almost been 24 hours... can you explain a little further why this happens and what happens if it stays unconfirmed for longer? Will it be returned to the source or just sit uncofirmed for eternity?

Thanks again, i really appreciate your responses! I upped the fee to the highest for my next transactions and will just sit patiently waiting for the first one I sent you. Cheers!!
