Coinbase is slow as shit, but it never takes more than a few hours to get coins out of them. (In just takes 6 confirmations).
I know it's painful, but just log out and go get lunch. You'll get your coins.

I'm buying at regular intervals (my pay period) so I'm not really paying attention to the "entry point."
That being said, when the chart is doing crazy ass shoots up I might wait, but usually I just hit "buy."
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:14:02
I'm *really* curious to see what happens with this. Since the futures are cash-settled, they have literally no connection to actual bitcoins.
Bears can short the futures into the ground, or bulls can buy the shit out of them, but the trading bots on GDax won't even notice or care.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:58:54
I took my 0.8 BTC and didn't complain.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:31:19
If you think about it, at the big bank-Fed-country level, the USD is really a virtual currency already. They don't put 145 billion dollars in a suitcase and hand it over.
They might as well call it "DollarCoin" or whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:10:46
The actual, real reason:
The general public wants to gamble on the price of bitcoin and get in on the action. Now they can do it without having to figure out how bitcoin works. And the CME is like fuck yeah bring on them fees, baby.

Seriously, get a BCC wallet and do it yourself, today. I was able to get my BCC turned into bitcoin in about four hours total (most of it waiting for confirmations) last week.
1) create BCC wallet using your keys
2) send BCC to exchange
3) get BTC
4) send to your main wallet
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:28:09
Current price is *exactly* last price. WTF dude.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:03:13

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:13:19
I took out my investment a LONG time ago, so this is basically a free ride, so I couldn't care less. I could sell for $25 and it'd still be a profit.

I wouldn't classify myself as a "hater" but honestly it's a matter of time before the IRS orders all assets on Coinbase frozen.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:17:56
I'd love to buy but unfortunately it takes like 12-14 fucking days for me to get any meaningful amount of cash into a BTC exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:24:56
FIRST, make damn sure you understand that Bitcoin is *not* investing. You don't "invest" in something that goes up and down 10% every hour.
This is insanity. I'm in, don't get me wrong. But it's not investing.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:03:57

@_date: 2017-11-16 17:24:27
There's no reason to fear yet because the general investing public still has no idea what Bitcoin is or how to get one.
Once Goldman announces they're putting clients in BitCoin? Yeah, time to start pushing the Sell button.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:12:28
When somebody forks BitCoin, it should be required to create a one-button-push method to extract and dump the alt coins into BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:34:55
I don't believe in BitCoin very much, if at all. But I'm making *Bank* in the short term.

It's not all "priced in." BCash will be pretty close to zero when this happens. Remember Borders Books? People thought that was "all priced in" then we shorted it all the way to zippo.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:45:02
The "unit" should be whatever that last digit is. A Satoshi or whatever the fuck. People who aren't neckbeards have no idea that .0000000000000001 bitcoin is even possible.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:27:40
You get AAPL and/or AMZN. And holders of the stock make billions.

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:15:19
Exactly the same way a corn/gold/pork bellies future works. You are simply betting on the price in the future. For 99.9999% of the people, no pork bellies ever trade hands. 
I'm not sure how this is going to affect the actual price of Bitcoin since the contracts will be settled with USD.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:10:14
Yeah but at this point it's greedy people and bots vs. other greedy people and bots. Fight club.

The tits on that girl though... jesus
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:08:06
I know for a fact this: A while back (think like $5 per coin) I had about 10 bitcoins. They are now forever locked behind a private key I threw away for not caring.
Honestly I think the "maximum bitcoins" should be increased by some fudge factor to make up for all the  "lost" coins out there.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:20:46
Watch GDAX and you'll see the chart do that like every 15 minutes. It's crazy seeing the bots do battle.

I'm making a shit ton on BitCoin but there's still no way in hell I'll actually accept it as legal tender in a transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:21:53

Wall Street: "OMG July BTC futures are down 45%"
Bitcoin: *shrug*
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:30:00
Truth is, if "1% of the stock market" decided, today, it wanted BitCoin, the price would be around $250,000 in a matter of seconds. Or possibly quicker. Anyone who's worked the stock market floor knows what this rush would look like.
HODLers (the smart ones) would immediately bail and disappear to their private islands, then the price would crash to zero as the tulip bubble bursts. Imagine the Winklebros dumping 100,000 bitcoins as sneakily as they can manage.
Then cryptos would probably be banned forever in the US.
