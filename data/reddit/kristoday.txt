What's the problem with an altcoin basically "starting over" Bitcoin? As in, doing what Bitcoin does, but completely starting itself like say tomorrow, because Bitcoin has a limit to how many transactions it can do, as far as I understand, unless Segwit and Lightning extend that indefinitely (and I'm not sure how)... If Bitcoin can't extend itself indefinitely (like real-world cash), then I see no problem with copycats.

Yah so maybe I didn't get what he meant by centralization... but he was very much in favor of central authority over transactions anyways, so I don't think he's sympathetic to decentralization.

You misunderstood what I said; I said: "I thought centralized **by location** \(like country\) required 51&amp; of the miners to be **in that location** \(like China\)". Centralized by location means not world\-wide.
The reason I said this was because of the last line of your reply: "it was also centralized in location too, but this change with chima regulations"
The largest percentage by location I'd read was China with 21&amp; \(of the global market\), so I didn't know what you meant by "centralized in location"... when it comes to mining, centralization per country doesn't matter because mining is accessible to anyone worldwide. 51&amp; of China miners does not make consensus of Bitcoin, so I'm not sure what you were trying to say.

I thought centralized by location \(like country\) required 51&amp; of the miners to be in that location \(like China\), but I thought the greatest percentage by country was only up to 21&amp; in China. Was I wrong?

Because they don't know they know fuck\-all and don't know they're asking stupid questions. But so far I don't know that you know more than fuck\-all nor how you know why it's a stupid question, so feel free to actually explain instead of just being a blow\-hard.
