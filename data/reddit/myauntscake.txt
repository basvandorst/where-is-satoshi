Roads were not a terrible idea, you clearly have no clue. Also , let people....you guys go real quick to wanting to control people.
Y'all can fuck off.

You shouldn't be worried about me, you should be worried about the companies and governments.
You can say it's paranoid but again I would say many of you don't understand tech or data at all. Especially how it's being used against you.

More name recognition/ traction. Also are the other ones blatantly pushing themselves or were they made by a nerd just having fun?
Intention is important as well, history has shown good/bad people, doesn't matter, will alter the truth for their agenda
Again taking no sides, but this is something new, you say others already existed. Not the same level, that's like saying good gamers always existed. Now we have professional ones , so clearly there's a distinction in things as they grow.

So if we have 10 coins with bitcoin in name your fine with that. You wouldn't think that users that are already confused or new users that will for sure be confused, wouldn't have a negative effect on network and growth?
I'm not agreeing with what op posted, but you saying it's completely irrelevant is hilarious.

Does this woman even understand bitcoin or hopping on that wave? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:19:24
She was before 2011, yet isn't a developer? That sounds far fetched especially if she doesn't have a shitload of coin.
I don't think she'll be doing any English interviews outside japan she hardly talks. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:13:07
Cool hopefully she does, she doesn't have to be a developer but we for sure don't need people moving in simply using their cute factor, although personally Japanese girls are not cute at all.

You advise people to use Dropbox and Google drive for security. Jesus Christ people need to just educate themselves cus even some of you IT people have no clue.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:43:58
Do you have a personal home server? I feel like that's becoming inevitable if you truly want secure files you can access globally...but then it requires a lot of know how and initial setup.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:48:31
That's not true either...every major American city shows both roads and trains are needed. 
You guys just love pushing an agenda or one ideology.
I realize for thousands of years we were ....inefficient, brainwashed, told what to think.
But fuck, can you guys have any critical thought and realize the future should for sure be nothing like the past.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:31:38
Interesting thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:11:10
Now your proving you're just trying to start shit. Also it's the internet stop being a pussy.
Y'all are clowns on both sides, but the biggest dumb shit is when you guys say "can't we all get along" 
No we fucking can't haven't you been paying attention to every country lately, every countries citizens hate their fellow citizens. Get the fuck over it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:50:52
Omg you're such a smart 14 year old....my nigga what 12 year old fucking post on bitcoin on Reddit. Also I'm not black you fucking racist.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:17:55
Then why are you telling people "don't bother" also your a fool if you trust an American company...because even if an American company is good the American government and others have shown they can and will infiltrate.
Again you've only shown foolish wishful thinking. Sit down.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:37:28
Lol do you even know why you say dumb shit or comes naturally?
The market cap bro, it demands it. lOL isn't it freshman week? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:59:37
Wait so just because a big company already is doing things there should be no competition.
Wait a company that has shown to be shady towards cities and has tons of user data should always be trusted.
You sound like a fool.

Nigga stop acting like you know what satoshi wanted. You ever read all his posts? I own a book with them all...so stfu nigga. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:01:45
Are you using stats for the last decade or at least last 14 years? Where people can't get jobs, take jobs way below pay grade I'll while owing 40 grand or more?
Please...you fools act like it's the fucking 70s still.
@_date: 2017-07-01 11:14:20
Syas the douchebags writing paragraph replies about some other man's ego....holy shit you got mental issues out the bass dude.
This guy is right...half of you 12 year olds don't even own bitcoin other half are just assholes cus life sucks.
Your a bunch of cucks, and mad real men take real risk.
"Urrrrr YOUR EGO...SHOW PHOTOS...BLAH BLAH BLAH"
HOLY CRAP STRAIGHT CUCKS.

You sound bitter...university by and large is useless for many people.   Zuckerberg dropped out of uni, so what's your point? You sound bitter, he's a dumb kid that's richer than you and he has professor parents clearly hell be weird.
