Bitcoin is extremely monitored.. sure its seems all nice and anonymous, but the spy agencies pretty much know who everyone is. Would they rat you out to your tax authority? I dunno.. it probably depends.
You don't really say what kind of tax you're trying to avoid.. if you ran a business where your customers pay you in BTC you can probably avoid reporting a lot of that and just keep the money.
If you are generating profits in the normal non-BTC economy I don't really think bitcoin will help you.. sure you can move money into BTC and that will prevent it being seized, but it wont do anything to hide that it used to exist (say in your austrian bank account) and you didn't pay taxes on it.
One area where I think BTC may be useful is with offshore holding companies in tax havens.. basically registering an offshore company is pretty anonymous, but to be of any use you normally need someone to put up their passport to operate the bank account for it. With Bitcoin that's nolonger necessary.. you can have a very anonymous offshore holding company that operates through other onshore entities.. these onshore entities would use all the normal tax evasion hoopholes to funnel money into BTC to the offshore owning company in the form of dividends or intellectual property licensing fees etc.
This wouldn't be too different from how things already operate, other than since no passports or ID need to be provided to anyone the offshore company can really be pretty damn opaque. Also since all the profits are retained in your bitcoin wallet it doesn't really matter if you trust the directors of your offshore entitiy since you retain ultimate control over the bitcoin wallet. You can pretty much use any shady character and it doesn't matter since they can't steal the money.
