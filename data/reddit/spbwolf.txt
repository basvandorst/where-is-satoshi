Netsukuku, serval project, there may be others... it is possible we will forget about providers.

I'm not sure that I understood you correctly (my bad english)... if I understood correctly, this is a solution of a technical problem in a political way, and this means that de facto bitcoin is a form of fiat money. In that case, what is it for?
Fiat money can not do without regulation. Without violence, this is not functional.
If the money (senders and recipients of transactions, balances of addresses) are traceable, they will be regulated.  You do not 'own' this money - they are owned by regulators. In another way it is technically impossible.

I see.

Bitcoin is fully traceable.
As a result, ALL bitcoins will be tainted by contacts (not only direct) with bad (or washed, which is the same) addresses.
This will be the end of bitcoin. You can not use 'your' bitcoins without the permission of banks, authorities, lawyers, anyone...
It is also not necessary to arrest 'the owner' of the bitcoins. It is enough 'to arrest' his/her bitcoins.

95% ... 90% ... 80% ... 70% ... 50% ... 25% ... 0 !!!!!
Of course, bitcoin will not disappear in one moment. EVERY bitcoin will lose and lose the price. More and more bitcoins will not be accepted as payment by merchants, sellers, authorities. More and more transactions will be rejected by the miners and operators of nodes of next layers because of the connection with bad addresses which are indicated by governments and banks. When fall starts, it will be an avalanche. I think that it will begin not later than in five years, and one year will suffice that bitcoin lost value completely and forever.
I do not own and never owned bitcoin.
