I don’t own any btc, but let me tell you something.
Bitcoin isn’t going to die anytime soon that’s for sure.

Wait a minute. I am OP. Check the handles before attacking me,... or attacking him. Or if you wanna attack both then that's fine.

How dare you post this link in this thread?!
Here's the place to attack Leah Goodman, jerk each other off, get some upvotes and feel like you're part of a community. OMG, burn, did you see it, she GOT DESTROYED, LOL, 420!

Oh I forgot to put in the title: "This will surely get downvoted but...". That reverse psychology would have done the trick. Shit.
I'd like to take the opportunity to say that yes this community has cancer.

Could you elaborate a little bit more about his personality on being "an asshole", I'm very interested in that aspect. If you could give an example of something that he did or behave that made you form that impression.

I understand your point.
And yes, I confess my belief is based solely on her words. Since there's not really any evidence yet on both sides, and it's her words against his, I prefer to choose hers. I don't choose his because I "know" Satoshi wants to remain anonymous.
The point I was trying to make with this post is that sometimes we have to trust things or people, not everything is always crystal clear and not always there's proof for everything we want. I just trust the damn reporter right now, and trust that he said that quote in that context that the article states.

I don't have evidence, It's just a belief (I put the word believe in my title), a judgment. You believe the article is crap and he's not Satoshi right? So it's the same way.
