You can't prove it. You really think we would go back in time in case of small government state?


In the beginning governments were focused around military and basic law enforcement, not welfare and regulation of private sector.


Always? Or maybe it's other way around, like in [Microsoft case](


Yeah every responsible business owner know that state can fuck him over for no obedience, and countries who used to regulate everything (like Russia) are leading in this.


Yeah sure buddy. Private sector will suddenly forgot agriculture technology without daddy government.

You seem to confuse overall progress of humanity with government expansion. You think private sector can't "organize groups of specialists and professionals from a range of different fields, that provide essential services"?
*Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.*
