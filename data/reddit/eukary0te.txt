I did the exact same thing.  I guess there’s a bit more interest in that documentary right now!

It’s cheese. My bum is on the cheese, my bum is on the cheese, if I get lucky, I’ll get a disease.

I agree, although I was say Occam's razor in this case points to him being Satoshi. I'm not a cypherpunk but [this panel]( last year convinced me he's not just some idle scammer.  He's clearly very knowledgeable about Bitcoin, and beyond that he has a clear vision of what the underlying tech is capable of and a vision for its use in society.  He's ominously displayed on a large screen over-looking the audience and makes some vague evasive comments about his involvement in Bitcoin. I think he's just an acerbic academic personality who initially wanted to stay quiet and has gradually left bread crumbs and now wants to come forward.
The thing is, what does he gain by scamming?  He has no control over Bitcoin.  He's not going to waltz in as the leader of it once he provides irrefutable proof of control of early blocks.  Also, when I look at the libertarian views most of the panel are spouting, it doesn't surprise me he has tax issues with the Australian government; he probably thinks taxation is immoral / illegal.
We know he has a long history of crypto involvment. We know he's not hard up - he has a massive super computer.  I want to know what he's been using it for.  In that panel he clearly didn't want to talk about that and deflected several questions on it.
