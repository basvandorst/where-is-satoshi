My best friend from junior high bought 20 bitcoin when they were worth nothing and we all made fun of him and told him real men trade stocks. Oh well. Lives at the top of a Vegas highrise now and rents Ferraris. Used crowdfunding &amp; bitcoin to start a successful marketing agency.

You are late. There was a twitter trend a little while ago about how 95% of bitcoin owners are male (I don't know what they were basing this off of or if it's true) and how deregulated currency would be used to rebuild the gender wealth gap.

I've found that remarkably few people have any idea what the terms pyramid and ponzi scheme mean.
Buying into some commission-based sales position then finding out the company changed its name and moved to Zimbabwe before you could achieve ROI is a ponzi scheme. In this sense, some altcoins that had no real reason to exist/ were never even intended to succeed beyond an initial pump are/were ponzi schemes.
Volatile investments that handsomely reward early birds (as bitcoin already has) and burn latecomers (as bitcoin surely will some day) are a fundamental feature of logic/reality. It's a phenomenon too basic to even warrant a name.
Then again viral human stupidity is what made us our money to begin with, isn't it? If they were smart we would have missed the boat and they'd be cashing in right now.

They aren't thieves but their website and infrastructure is definitely very raw. I'd get broken pages after making a transaction with no way to find out if it went through &amp; some of the pulldown menus don't work on chrome for me. I just can't trust people who can't hire a decent web developer with that kind of cash.

Meh. I sold half at 16k and I'll leave the other half to ride through whatever chaos ensues as wall street descends. Will  keep that month poised for a dip or breakout. 
Mostly it's just psychological. People who have everything in the game are going to be stressed out and obsessively staring at gdax for the next month, possibly making kneejerk decisions.

Even as a hardcore BTC bull I don't like this. 1 mil is a totally arbitrary figure and these guys are using it to for blatant attention-seeking.
You had a million guys predicting everything would be worth a million dollars during the .com boom and while everything did end up being worth a million dollars, it wasn't before all the panicky clueless investors these "evangelists" dragged in caused the market to crash multiple times.

I recommend btc price addicts split their holdings 50/50
50 in a safe wallet and leave the other 50 in an exchange for you to satisfy your psychological addiction and freak out about price shifts, set limit trades...

The one thing I've learned in years of trading/investing with horrible losses and big gains... Your intuition is a lot better than what some pro pumper/basher says. Even if you're mediocre it's better. Every trade I ever made based on expert consensus was a steaming pile. It's our nature to want free information and you have to fight it.

They're never very creative because they don't need to be. Just invent some confusing way something is "racist" or "sexist" and unthinking people will take your word for it.
There is already an anti-bitcoin social activist army on Twitter convinced that decentralized currency:
Is overwhelmingly male-owned therefore a tool to deliberately rebuild the alleged gender wealth gap beyond the reach of government. Cuz ya know. Us dudes attend secret meetings theorizing how to keep our gfs and sisters broke. Mine tried to sneak onto my computer to buy bitcoin, but luckily they don't know how to read and I caught them in time.
Is "the darkweb racist version of money" because groups concerned about the European migrant crisis are taking anonymous donations in bitcoin. This definitely says less about bitcoin and more about how Orwellian the EU has become. People fear jail time for looking at the wrong graphs/blogs. Maybe fix that first.
Also the electricity used to mine bitcoins caused global warming.

@_date: 2017-12-03 16:24:56
Yep. Even the oldschool goobers calling btc a ponzi scheme or saying it should be banned etc concede that digital currency should become a standard part of portfolio diversification because of the unique island it's on relative to the traditional dollar vs gold paradigm. I'm not sure how they can say that and not realize the price implications if btc/ether became even 1% of the standard investment portfolio, but a great deal of them haven't devoted more than 5 minutes to the topic or figure they'll be dead by then anyway.

Yeah I was born in the northern Middle East, lived in western Europe, then all over the (western) US.
The EU is a scary Orwellian dictatorship these days. I'm not trying to get in a macho match with you. I like Europe &amp; wish the best for Europeans.
It's the objective truth. The crackdowns on free speech &amp; internet privacy are a concrete reality. That combined with the migrant crisis &amp; diaspora of the native ethnicities, prospects are very grim. I definitely moved all of my own investments away from EU-dependency and I'm wary about US maintaining close alliance with most EU member states considering their near-term fates.

Since BTC transactions are anonymous what prevents someone from claiming they bought their holdings 5 minutes ago at the current market price when they actually bought it at $30? Their love for the IRS? Srs question.

For sure. I'll never be the "6 million by 2023!" guy, but BTC practically tells you when to execute a swing trade.

Most analysts are comparing BTC curves to coca-cola and walmart. They call every normal day of trading an unprecedented parabolic blowoff not understanding that BTC growth is more similar to a collective service company acquiring new business than it is to traditional stock valuation therefore 'corrections' aren't really even necessary theory. It will be a while before they have enough of a clue to revise their terminology.

With taxation will come accountability for exchanges. This is no longer normal. As the values of many coins plateau profit will shift primarily towards trading. We aren't going to trade out of our Nano S or paper wallets.

By swing trade?
Daytrading is pretty self explanatory and longterm investing as well. Swing trades are an intermediate.
Basically a swing trade is when you see a price swinging around a resistance point for a few days or weeks and buy it on the low swings, sell it on the high swings. Such as BTC has been doing swinging around the 10k landmark price.
For a while you could set your watch to $AMD falling to 2-3 bucks because Intel was taking over the world, everyone crying bankruptcy, then swinging back to $4 when people bothered to look at their finances. It was easy pickings for anyone who noticed the pattern.
A blow-off top is when a price rises too fast and abruptly pulls back — not necessarily because of bad news but just because impulsive or "weak hand" investors decided saw a scary steep line and decided to cash out. Like when these mainstream journo dorks were reporting 11k back to 9k as a "catastrophic plummet! bubble has popped! oh no!. They can be prime swing trading targets.
