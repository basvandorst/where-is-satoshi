In the country where I live, there is a law that if you find lost money and return it to the owner you are legally entitled to keep 10%. Even if the person who lost it does not want to give you a reward, you can take 10% legally before returning the funds to them and no crime has been committed. I think this is a good rule of thumb and would like to see other countries adopt the same law.

Nope, they are really doing this. Living here in Japan I have seen how these things are rolled out. The Japanese gov is very supportive of BTC and businesses (banks and exchanges in particular) see it as a big emerging market. The missing piece now is getting the public onboard. To do this they need to ease them into it, with UFJ coin etc... Once people understand the technology, get used to using it, and once the stigma of BTC is forgotten... it will take off HUGE here. 2-3 year timeframe I imagine. The government has even stated that they would like to have BTC featured as an important technology by the time the Olympics roll around in 2019, with businesses set up to accept it.

Hi, I never received my rig and I did follow up on three occasions. Once directly to you on the forums after 2 months of not receiving a shipment and after not being able to get any answers through customer service. There was no admission of liability and I was told it most likely got held up in customs. At the time I asked for a refund but was told to talk to customer service again. So at that point I felt I had sunk as much time into this whole venture as needed and just moved on. This is one of only two times in my life that I have ordered a product over the net and never received it. The other was a shady bike gear supplier on Alibaba. But... you are correct, it is a bit childish to accuse you of theft... just venting really I suppose... However, whether it was malice or incompetence, the fact remains that I am still out $150 + time + stress + having to find an alternative frame for my rig after waiting months for the one I purchased to arrive + lost mining time.

I was in Buenos Aires last year and there is a large and active BTC group. I tried exchanging with a few of the "cambio" currency traders in the street but, though they had heard of it, no one knew how to use it. In Santiago Chile I tried paying for things like parking rental and vehicle purchases in BTC but no one I talked to was interested. They seemed very curious though and I found that if I explained it as "the opposite of currencies like the Venezuelan Bolivar" they kind of understood the potential.

Still lots of profit to be made. Should keep trending up until the halvening (2-3 weeks away). After which there might be a dip or it could continue up to make a new all time high. Within a year or so expect the decimal place to shift to the right and for people to start trading in mBTC as the value reaches the + $2/3K range.

I've been traveling in developed and developing countries my whole life... Only once have I had something stolen--a bag that I set down for less than a minute to try on a suit in Spain. Stop watching the news and actually get out and see the world, not as scary as you might think.
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:30:07
First, the IRS doesn't give a shit about the amounts that I move around. Second, is Bisq a "foreign" "offshore" account? Third, how can you just assume everyone on Reddit is American? Fourth, I live in a foreign country and run a small business so I move money between accounts all the time and convert between currencies--there is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary about this. Not sure what the point of your question is.

Hi, I've been here for a while and have heard people talk about safety concerns and about the problem of theft, however, my experience has been very positive and I believe that if you take basic precautions then things should be OK. This has been what I've heard from a number of other travelers as well.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:16:02
Hi, basic precautions would be meeting at an office or at a very public place near a police station, taking pictures of photo IDs with address and phone etc..., small exchanges at first and then in increasing increments as trust is established and more details are known about the other person.

I also am used to dealing in BTC and it seems natural--personally I don't have a problem with it. Having said that, I would like to see Bitcoin get adopted more widely rather than have it just be for early adopters/ tech-geeks/ and a few hedge funds. In other words, I would rather see more people buying smaller amounts in order to expand the total user base and speed up mass adoption. I worry the price notation now is too intimidating/ daunting for the average person.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:43:50
That's the whole point. Back before we had a denomination system for BTC worked out for Bitcoin they went back and forth about it in the threads. Then it hit a tipping point and the current BTC/ mBTC/ uBTC/ bits/ Satoshi got adopted as the best plan. This is how consensus emerges... posts like this that get ppl thinking about a change that may need to take place on the horizon.

No, like helping the homeless, digging wells in developing regions, helping some dude fix his plane in Africa, education, funding code development projects, a relief fund for Dorian Nakamoto, helping send the Jamaican bobsled team to the olympics, along with things I've listed here like the EFF, etc.. etc...

I think the pump is related to Gox claims finally being resolved, thus lifting a big market uncertainty... + the approaching halvening. Nothing to do with hedging currency devaluation as we've been told.

That may be your reality but without that first wave of media attention we wouldn't be here at this price-point today. Its a complex ecosystem with many drivers but it sounds naive to suggest that positive press (media buzz) played no part in promoting  the technology as a worthy investment.

You actually illustrate my point. When BTC fully inflates, bits might be the new dollar equivalent which would put the market cap at $21TRN (3x market cap of gold). Your parents and friends wouldn't know how to buy .0005 BTC now and it probably doesn't sound interesting to them even though we know that .0005 BTC = $1. But if you told them that you can get 500 bits (.0005BTC) for a dollar and that the price doubled in the past 6 months... then they might be more interested/ motivated.

Hi, will be in touch. In a remote area now in the south with not much internet access.
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:35:52
Right, with the first wave early adopters... And those people went on to introduce BTC to their friends and families, to teach others how to use it, and to develop the ecosystem. Same thing will happen with the next wave of adopters, it will just more focussed on the mainstream. If we don't get the common person onboard now, this whole things might get captured by global elite, banks, and the same old power structure

No, it is not. It is a function of network difficulty (total sum of network hashing power) and its relation to the difficulty retargeting algorithm which tries to keep block generation at 10 min on average. For the last period, we had continued huge gains in hardware efficiency which outpaced the ability of the algorithm to achieve the 10 min target. Now we are at 14 nm (?) chips and we cannot expect huge efficiency gains like we saw in the past. This should have the effect of re-decentralizing mining to one extent or another as now even hobbyists can buy mining gear without having to worry about their equipment being outdated in 6 months to a year.

As someone who has been here 20+ years and who has been into BTC since early 2013 I tend to disagree with you. It is being rolled out but behind the scenes. It reminds me of the iPhone in a way. There were all these articles saying Apple could never penetrate the Japanese market and, indeed, the average Japanese person on the street knew nothing about it... fast forward a few years and everyone and their cousin has an iPhone. BTC will be the same way. Average man on the street has never heard of it at this point but in a few years time it will be pervasive. The Japanese government and industry are laying the groundwork for this as we speak.
