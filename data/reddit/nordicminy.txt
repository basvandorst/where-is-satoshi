I really hope you're joking.

Bitcoin has been relatively stable the last few weeks and lots of people liked it for being volatile. 
First frame is everyone wanting bitcoin to be volatile again and second frame is bitcoin being volatile... Just not in the direction people like (depending on who you ask)

Ya know or... Have their own goals.

Howdy there sir/madam. I encourage you to not try and time the market by waiting for the "next stock market crash." If you're uncomfortable putting all of your cash into the market at one time... maybe put half of it in and then set up a re-occurring automatic buy every week or so. This will help you "cost average" even if there is a bit of a slump... 
Currently I'm in Vanguard VTSAX fund which tries to mirror the total *stock* market. I am not claiming this is the "best" one by any means... but the expense ratio is currently .04%. I think there are a few others that are slightly less expensive than this.
Also a conservative method of investing is the "age rule" which basically means you "should" have whatever age you are of your portfolio in bonds. For example if you are 30...70% of your portfolio "should" be in stocks and 30% in bonds. There are great bond funds out there as well.
I encourage you to do your own research and make an informed decision. I'm not a financial adviser... just a random guy on the internet. Good luck!
Edit: total *stock* market.... not the market as a whole

Very tough to do if it's not your full time job. Even if it is your full time job... very very tough to be smarter and more informed than the collective market.

Time. Nobody can time the market... just time IN the market
Basically my theory of investing (in anything largely traded) is that nobody knows wtf is going on. I'll use the stock market since it's more "conventional" and there is more data.
Think of how many really really smart people there are all trying to do the same thing. They are all looking at the same data and trying really really hard to make a good decision on the value of stocks. When you have that many people doing the same thing the outcome is usually going to be pretty close to the same thing... it becomes almost an organism itself.
So if it's all the same... and nobody is theoretically any more informed or better than anyone else... how do I chose? The common denominator is fees. I can't pick which adviser or fund will be better than any other one (because nobody knows wtf)... but I can control the fee that I pay.
This is one of the primary reasons that low cost fee index funds have become the norm for "smart" investing.
Crypto there isn't that much in terms of fees (unless you're day trading)... so just time in the market really. 
I'm not an financial adviser but this is the theory that makes sense to me... and I try to follow it.

Thank you... lol.

I'd be interested in your results and analysis. If you have done so well... have you considered becoming a financial adviser? Surely this would result in an incredible amount of income with even a low fee.

I mean... lol @ 3%... but you do you bro! Hope the chart works out well for you!

Sorry I was trying to convey that people who aren't making a living off of trading need to have TIME in the market.
I don't encourage people to try and be traders because I believe it's an impossible task to be quite frank.
