Sorry I'm not totally familiar with Electrum either. But it seems like all modern wallets follow similar security standards, the difference being one is a full node and one a lightweight client. Electrum may have extra options to export wallet data like we're used to?

Multibit was bought by Keepkey, LLC. Their HD wallet looks like it's an attempt to maximise security for a non technical user, and once you wrap your head around their system; multiple addresses (HD), seed words and encrypted wallet files auto backed up to cloud. It makes sense/seems secure. 
I haven't used Multibit enough to totally vouch for it though. Many users are totally stumped when they have no wallet.dat or can't export private keys raw, etc.

You're obviously quite far down yourself to be that arrogant and bitter.

Agreed. Its value is derived from its utility, if you still can't see its usecases you haven't researched enough. Don't want to say it too loudly here but the cash crowd is right also; value is derived from it being used in commerce. 
I think distribution is another force of value; this is why the energy hungry proof of work method is still worth it. These days we debate methods of distribution (PoS, PoW, etc), we argue over how decentralized a protocol really is. These discussions didn't even exist a decade ago.
And let's not forget anyone can audit "the books", flag fraudulent coins, monitor account movements, have access to open source financial instruments like democratic smart contracts (privately or publicly, locally regionally or globally). 
Whether you agree or disagree consensus can achieve anything; roll backs, bailouts, inflation, account freezing, stock splits and protocol changes. To say it's unregulated isn't exactly correct, it's just not regulated in a way that traditional economists and regulators understand. Plus most of the diehard supporters are against bailouts and inflation, etc..
Sorry I got a little carried away there..

He's implying that you're a core shill and their new PR slogan to bash 2x is calling it "paypal 2.0". An attempt to neutralize discussion, but really it speaks volumes about his thought process. You are right; code up or shut up.

It's not even deep state conspiracy, it's quite open, just look at the life of Edward Bernays and perception shaping. Bacon and eggs for breakfast anyone?

Oh man that first article:


They may be right and a low positive inflation might be best for a currency but what fucking consensus? Wheres the referendum to decide a central banks inflation rate or anything they do. Here's another archaic quote not from the article but a classic of what they were pushing in the 80's and 90's:
