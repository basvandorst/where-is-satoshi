The guy who runs BTC Guild has already said he'll reduce hashing power by ~15% if that does happen.

Wait until MtGox comes back up and crashes, and buy more (if you want). Otherwise, just wait.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:26:17
The thing is in the stock market there is no lag, so the effect is not nearly as significant.

Mt.Gox's failure to develop its infrastructure to keep up with the influx of buyers is really disappointing. It's about time they made a major fuck-up and people need to stop using them. 
It isn't even easy to get money into Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:52:31
That lag.

You could transfer your coins to a Bitfloor account and set up the ACH withdrawal there. 
It'll still take a day or two likely, but definitely not 10.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:03:59
We've already concluded that MtGox is a fucking joke.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:48:24
An hour? I thought it was opening for trading in ~10 minutes unless I got my time zones wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:30:45
I went to BofA an hour ago to make a cash deposit... funds were in my Bitfloor account within 10 minutes.
Also, this isn't necessarily a reason not to use Bitfloor; Localtill's issues are just a reason not to use the cash deposit method of getting funds into Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:12:19
The increased demand caused the same effect a DDoS would (maybe not as extreme, however).

Bought 0.75 btc from Coinbase on Friday for the first time ever. No clue if the transfer will actually clear with my bank, but looks like it's a decent investment already (who can complain about 14% in a weekend?).
Originally I was just testing the process, but I'm considering buying a couple hundred dollars worth - just not sure if I should wait for the price to go down (if it will).
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:00:29
Technology, yes. Time and space, not so much.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:33:28
Considering high-frequency trading at MUCH higher volumes exists on the stock market, I'd assume any lag is insignificant.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:28:24
His opinions about everything are pretty ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:31:14
Probably more concentrated.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:22:24
70 minute lag is worse than breaking down.
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:44:52
Wow, I'm really worried if my order will go through then. Placed an order last Friday for 0.75 btc.
I DID already see a pending charge in my bank account though, so I'm hopeful.
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:26:34
I'm not accusing him of a crime, but regardless:
Yes, he did lose coins when Bitfloor was hacked some time last year.
Also, the Bitfloor bank account was closed, cutting off a lot of people from their money, and he hasn't been even remotely good about providing updates on his attempts to resolve the issue.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:31:26
Well what's been going on recently is a ton of small transactions (0.01 btc or so) to bring the price down. Pretty clear manipulation, but the flurry of transactions causes lag on MtGox.
Every time there's lag the price goes down. Today was the worst so far. 
If the exchange went down instead, it would've been like halting trade. Other exchanges still could've operated just fine and there would be no reason for the panic sells.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:59:21
Hit a high earlier today of about $266.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:41:01
It's no longer $130... it's $178.
Looks to me like some entity(ies) with a lot of buying power are manipulating the market... and they're making a metric shitton of money.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:37:53
There goes most of the lag; down to 4 minutes. And up the price goes :D
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:34:12
Blacklist the people who are placing hundreds or thousands of small orders.
Also, we need to stop relying on MtGox to carry out a majority of North American btc transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:54:43
Are you sure now is a good time to buy..?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:07:41
That's why.
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:09:12
oh hey, first time someone has ever referred to a link I posted :D
But in seriousness, I figured this whole process would take a lot longer than 10 business days in the first place. Granted, Roman hasn't been doing a remotely decent job of appeasing his customers, but there's nothing that can be done.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:40:37
The account is probably fake. It's not even doing a remotely decent job of managing PR either.
@_date: 2013-06-24 21:18:06
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:24:23
...Actually, it didn't. It lost about 25% based on most exchanges. Just sayin'.
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:18:01
You could probably do it with 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:33:51
Few orders slipped through, but I don't think they've opened the gates yet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:44:53
Well considering the price is back up to 200... 
Situation is not as bad as you make it seem.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:58:54
Hey. I'd like an invite. :D
Can't promise a tip though haha.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:43:16
Yup really.
Uneducated press screws btc's prospects for becoming more adopted.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:29:06
I'm stupid.
I made a similar mistake a few years back with cheap stocks. Realized the gains in the past two weeks were obviously speculation-fueled, but just held.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:23:07
I doubt Bitfloor crashed due to load. They weren't handling a ridiculous  amount of orders, and yet the website is completely down right now. MtGox too - didn't even develop delay (actually it got down to almost no delay at one point); just crashed.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:38:09
I'm not sure why they run out so fast... the window to buy closes pretty much within 30 seconds after it opens each time. The 24-hour limit isn't a calendar day; it's a rolling 24-hour limit.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:45:40
Thanks, haha. A couple people have told me that.
My iPhone's jailbroken, so I replaced the AT&amp;T logo with the Protoss logo with a tweak called Zeppelin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:53:36
The thing I don't understand is that BitFloor is trading steadily at ~$89 right now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:30:53
It's not an actual DDoS, but the effect is similar. It's caused by a flood if small orders of ~.01-.1 btc at a time.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:45:45
That just makes no sense.
The large value is the potential value in the future; you're not giving up your bitcoins for a smaller value when you do sell them because there is nothing for them to be compared to.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:29:01
They may be skilled, but they don't care about the bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:04:41
derp I'm too new to the bitcoin scene to get it then.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:52:14
It's actually 102, but your point still stands.
@_date: 2013-08-12 16:04:38
Just got $590 refunded! Instantly brightened my day :) 
HUGE thanks to and the IAFCU.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:35:47
No doubt. The growth we were seeing was impossible to sustain.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:09:43
Better go get some more Pentiums!
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:58:06
An exchange like BitFloor should be what people use - not trash like MtGox.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:43:22
Probably not.
Maybe by the end of tomorrow, though. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:02:20
So much for upgraded hardware..
100 seconds lag and no trades have even gone through.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:01:44
wow. me too :(
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:54:51
I was wondering how they could sell a retina MBP for $1500 when it retails for $2200.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:07:40
What a lame response.
No intent on restricting the wild manipulation... obviously because it gets them a lot of money.
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:16:49
So that's ~$1400 USD you just recovered? Nice.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:06:36
A LOT of action in China as well.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:56:29
The article was published today at 3PM EST. No information about when it was written.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:58:22
But other exchanges actually respond.
BitFloor put up a notice saying it was fixing server issues. Coinbase I'm not sure but they actually communicate and have posted here a couple times.
MtGox? Not a whisper except denying they were being DDoS'd at the start of the panic on twitter.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:44:31
That's exactly what someone without experience would say.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:38:19
probably fake, but you're doing a terrible job of managing PR.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:26:42
If MtGox went down early the panic wouldn't have happened.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:08:06
They can be lost. Same thing, essentially.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:26:30
Loss of potential gains, but not a loss of your own assets.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:36:49
Wow so almost 50 grand in profit. Congratulations.
I'm in the long hold with my 50 coins... Considering I got in at an average price of 163 I'm probably not selling any time soon. Hope MtGox can get its shit together.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:01:35
...wrong link?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:24:27
Don't bother. You won't get anything out of it and it'll kill your hardware.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:14:02
5 hours is a stretch; most likely 1-2 days minimum by wire transfer or bank transfer via Bitfloor, Coinbase, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:00:45
Doesn't matter if it is - it's accurate.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:57:30
We will find out in a few hours once the lag clears, I suppose.
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:42:13
That might be the 13" version, which makes sense.
I can't imagine anyone selling the 15" version at such a huge discount.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:41:38
Yaaaay more manipulation.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:21:47
According to one of his tweets he was using CapitalOne.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:34:20
I just have a minor gripe with bitfloor's prices always being a couple dollars higher than mtgox. 
In the grand scheme of things I suppose it doesn't matter though.
@_date: 2013-05-11 01:56:56
Why can't Roman be as good as this guy -_-
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:32:21
That's not exactly how Coinbase works.
They're not backed up to Friday, but they're out of coins to sell right now. Check in 20 minutes and maybe they'll have some. The whole deal with getting coins on Friday is if you want to place an order now and get your coins at Friday's price (a big gamble).
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:23:28
Just saw Mt.Gox hit an all-time high of 233 and still climbing... o.o
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:21:59
I don't have anything to give to you, but I wish you the best of luck.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:03:24
I heard a lot of praise actually from this subreddit, plus it's too inconvenient for me to use MoneyGram. Maybe wire if I ever plan on buying enough to make the ~$40 in fees worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:59:10
Lag is actually over 70 minutes .
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:02:22
Bitfloor's also down.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:26:09
This indicates to me that, eventually, the price will undoubtedly go up. If you have people like them with major holdings in btc, they'll find a way to drive the price up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:56:34
Yeah, I just figured people would be panicking like fuck and ditching their coins. Surprisingly not.... yet. We'll see once MtGox opens.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:13:30
I haven't done any research myself into specifics, but you have to also consider the amount of shares available.
@_date: 2013-04-29 03:12:52
10 days is not a definite timeline; it's an estimate that depends on the speed at which the bank processes the check and the speed of the actual delivery.
I'm definitely hoping he stays true to his promise, though. I have $600 sitting in my BitFloor account - not as much as many others but still means quite a bit to me.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:06:27
Just go look at bitcoinity.org/markets
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:40
Nice - lucky you.
I managed to sell for 90.7 on Bitfloor right before the bids went down to 80.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:37:53
Raining bitcoins... 
That would be quite awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:22:30
OP is asking about selling, not purchasing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:41:20
Well basically we did.
But anyone would have; panic is inherent. It was just kick-started by MtGox DDoS issues.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:53:36
Because with the current value of a bitcoin my paltry 10 coins gets me next to nothing?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:50:32
No it's not.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:59:26
Yea.. BitFloor is still climbing. Not sure if it's all about to go to shit or if we're going to see a small rebound.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:53:56
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:28:14
I can see where you're coming from, but no. Nothing really wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:33:26
Nice call.
Risky decision considering you were unemployed (depending on when you bought in), but looks like you got a nice fund to sustain your job search.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:13:26
Giving away even $50k in bitcoins wouldn't have caused what happened today..
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:59:27
The problem is that MtGox apparently doesn't give a shit.
Let them know by not using them. Use btc-e, bitstamp, campbx, bitfloor, coinbase, whatever. 
We're going to have many more of these DDoS-related crashes if MtGox doesn't fix their problems.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:28:43
Did you put a transaction fee on it?
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:12:34
Yeah the memory usage is ridiculous. After a few hours of having it open (with the blockchain already completed) I'll have 1.5GB+ RAM usage.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:59:55
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:22:14
He did make this post to say that you can't day trade btc.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:13:09
Where is it &lt;200?
I see a high of 230+ on BitFloor, and Bitcoinity shows 225 for Mt.Gox...
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:52:30
Last trade was 12 minutes ago.
According to a (no clue if it's legit), they were test transactions.
