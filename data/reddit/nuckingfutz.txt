If something is worth 4 BC, you give them four BTC cards each worth 1 BC. Or, you can give them one BTC card worth 5 BC each, and they give you "change" of one BTC card worth 1 BC.
It's... exactly the same as cash.

Sounds very similar to the issues Tor has encountered. When enough nodes were controlled by a single entity, researchers were able to associate entry and exit nodes. Because the exit node conveyed the non-Tor-encrypted message, and the entry node knew who the sender was, they were able to defeat the anonymity goal.
Control enough bitcoin nodes and you can print money. Furthermore, nobody will be able to detect it until you shut down your nodes.


Yes, as long as the dishonest nodes continue to outperform the honest nodes. However, that's not required for a one time theft. If the attacker disables his nodes (or loses control of the botnet, for example), eventually the honest nodes' competing proof-of-work chain would surpass the attackers'. At this point, the attacker's fraudulent transaction would revert to the original, honest transaction.
The argument on incentive (given the attacker has greater CPU power, why not generate coins?) fails to convince me. Conceivably one single transaction could transfer more coins than one could generate in a limited amount of time. Those coins could be traded for government-backed currency or goods, in a subsequent transaction that appears legitimate. At that point, if the attacker stops the botnet or overwhelming CPU power, even if the illegitimate transaction is reversed, the attacker still has real world value. The original bitcoin owner gets their coins back, but the entity that provided goods or currency has their transaction reversed without recourse for retrieving the real-world goods.
This might be overly wordy; I didn't take the time to write a shorter note, just exploring here.
tl;dr: given sufficient CPU power, attackers can fake transactions for coins, cash in the coins, and even if they are detected, it's already too late. They can repeat this over and over. Or they can leave the CPU power on and never get detected.

Anonymity, for one. I'm surprised BitCoin hasn't exploded in the black market.

is there an unofficial list ?

Thank you.
Wonder if we could start a wiki elsewhere... no idea on the legality of that. Wonder what country we'd have to host it in.

I would like to be paid in Bitcoins.
Income tax is a bitch.

This is genius. Why didn't I think of this?
@_date: 2011-05-11 02:19:37
Agreed. Honestly I'm not an expert on this stuff, I just think of movies where they agree to release the hostages for cash in unmarked bills.

Anonymous, no taxes, not traceable to bank accounts, transactions are difficult to monitor or trace. No physical evidence; can have your ill-gotten bitcoins on an encrypted drive. Can "back up" your money by storing it in multiple locations. Can't "freeze" an account. Can't reverse a transaction.
Essentially, all the power that banks, credit cards, and law enforcement had over money is - poof - gone.
Money laundering, trading in illegal goods, sending currency overseas in an untraceable fashion, hoarding wealth that can't be seized, all sorts of criminal activity would benefit from this.

Curious how this would apply on VAT and tariffs.

It's a good question - will probably be in the FAQ one day. It is one way that these differ from cash or credit.

He's not criticizing bitcoin, just the paper. But yes, he didn't understand.

Even cash has serial numbers and can be marked.
