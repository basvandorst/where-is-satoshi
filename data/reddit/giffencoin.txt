If you're only considering one currency pair then sure, but that does not make much sense. If you consider USD/EUR vs. BTC/EUR for instance then you'll see that the volatility comes from BTC.
edit: to put this into perspective, you're essentially saying: is it the train that moves compared to the rails, or the rails compared to the train? you need to take an outside point of view to decide

To answer some comments here's a link to another tweet by [Paul Vigna]( "It's currently on over-the-counter exchange. This would **make it a fully public ETF**, with participation, and $, from the Street."
So currently this is a regular OTC mutual fund, daily NAV, yadda yadda. They are trying to turn it into a fully fledged ETF (either by opening a new share class in the fund or merging into another fund, probably the former though). This would make it available to anyone allowed to trade ETFs (which is where of course they need to be reviewed and cleared). Now the interesting thing is that unlike the Vinklevoss' ETF this fund has a (albeit short) track record which gives it a bit more credibility.

It seems to basically just be more KYC stuff for exchanges which makes perfect sense and is *actually good for Bitcoin*. But make no mistake, it's not about terrorism and entirely about taxation.

Right I'm sure it's the central bank's fault and not the Versailles Treaty that forced a destroyed "Germany" to pay insane war damages (after confiscating some of their industry of course). They should have just kept inflation at a minimum and paid the highest real amount they could to France, that wouldn't have ruined the country for generations at all. 
The tendency of some people on here to ignore half the facts to support their narrative is *insane.*

Can you even read? It's literally in the Wikipedia article. I'm not gonna explain it all to you one more time, open a damn book. This is ridiculous, you're only punishing yourself by staying ignorant. Do as you will but shut the hell up in the future.

And I could make the same, or actually a better argument against deflation (not even hyper). Money supply theory is not as simple as you seem to believe.

Sure. Have you heard of the Great Depression in the 1930s? Here is some reading: 
But I have other examples too. Take a look at Japan (early 00s), Hong Kong (90s) or even Ireland after the financial crisis.
Here is why deflation is detrimental to the economy:  &amp; 
I did say in my comment above that "deflation (not even hyper)" was bad. By definition it's difficult to achieve hyper deflation since it has a built-in floor. Also government are better equipped to prevent deflation than inflation.

So you advocate for a system that has no way to adapt?

Can you please formulate a proper argument?
If you just want to farm karma and don't actually care about the issue at hand, I guess that's fine too but I'd like to know beforehand.

You seem very intelligent.
