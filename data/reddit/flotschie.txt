Is it correct to assume that with advanced adoption of LN usage, there will be less and less transactions on the main chain, causing new channel openings to get cheaper and cheaper?

Exactly. It is like filling your physical wallet with paper money for the next weeks/month. You do that first. Then, later, you go shopping and spend it.

Sorry I meant 5 common blocks after 12:20! So one block to go and AFTER that 6th block I guess we have to wait for the 1st on BCH chain only.

This. English is too good (no offense 14 year old eastern europeans) and given adress is empty (mentioned 0.04 BTC not there).

5 blocks as far as i can see already mined on BCH chain.

I know this can probably not answered right now, but I try anyway. I have my BTC on Bitfinex because they handle the split. My plan is to use my BTC immediately after I got my BCH. But when exactly is that? Technically it should be after the first block of the sidechain is mined, right? But how can I know if there is some post-processing within Bitfinex which could cause the assignment of BCH to my BTC account to be delayed? Which feedback will I get via the GUI and when? Many questions.

Bitfinex: BTC can be spend again??:
What timestamp will Bitfinex use to determine how many BCH users holding a BTC balance will receive?
=&gt;Bitfinex will use the timestamp of the last common block, meaning the timestamp of the first block that makes the median time increment to 12:20 pm UTC (or later) on August 1st. This happened at block height 478,558 - timestamp August 1st, 2017, 13:16:14 UTC.
What is the cutoff for new BTC deposits to receive BCH?
=&gt;We stopped processing BTC deposits at 12 pm UTC on August 1st, 2017. Any deposit that was not credited to Bitfinex wallet balances at that time is not eligible for BCH distribution.
So much confusion!

Exactly this lol.

A simple stop loss order creates a market order when the set price is reached. A stop-limit order creates a limit order when the set price is reached. 
It differs from exchange to exchange what they offer. Check exactly the conditions on any exchange before you create any kind of order if you do not completely understand what will happen exactly.

I would never do margin or even any more complicated trade than a simple market or limit order on Cryptocurrency exchanges. They have no experience, no awareness, no technological knowledge to handle these kind of extreme scenarios.

Thank you. What I do not completely understand is the rebalancing. What do you mean with that? I spend 0.1 of my 0.5 BTC, I have 0.4 on my channel. Rebalancing via third party payments will raise it up again to 0.5? Can not be so I do not understand that part.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:39:52
No I am just kidding, I am not a native speaker so I don't even know if that works out
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:00:00
Yeaaah but...you think too complicated. Look at Bitcoin_21s answer below.

Aaah now I get it. My balance stays the same, of course. But now I ask myself - do I really want this? Maybe I want to keep more BTC charged in my channel to Z, and less in channel to B, because e.g. Z has much better connection to the LN in general than B...?
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:21:18
I trust Core.

The clock is not correct. 1 Hour should be added. It is 12:20 PM UTC.
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:20:14
I just dont want that my coins end up on a dead chain. So I guess as long as i am not spending them, I am fine.
