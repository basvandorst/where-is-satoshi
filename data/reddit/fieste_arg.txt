Got it, thanks.
Another question, before sending btcs to the paper wallet, i added the address (watch only), and to send them, the private key of that address was asked. That's OK and i get it.
But do i really need to add the address of the paper as watch only to somehow activate the address (generated on bitaddress.org) or is not necessary?

100m...one day (:
I sent 0,01 from one account to another, then paper, both with fee and were almost instant, and the lastone from paper to online adress w/o fee and is waiting confirmation but i already can see the balance and it's ok.
Thanks!

I'm just discovering the bitcoin world, mainly through this sub. I'm learning a lot of new stuff and have a lot of material to read, would you recommend this network to someone new?
Thanks and good luck!

Hello bro, good to see i'm not alone starting.
After reading this sub for months, every single post, every single message, everything, i did my first purchase and transfers yesterday!
I would recommend to buy a small amount, practice tranfers, online wallets, offline, paper and improve your online security (passwords, malware, etc).
