Surely there must have been 7.6BTC in one of your CEX wallets at some point and now there isn’t and it must have gone to an address?
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:27:32
7 clearly visible centralised points in that mesh - is this a joke post?
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:02:12
The protocol lends itself to high volume centralised hubs as it’s not economically feasible to run smaller channels - the outcome of which is major organisations/entities controlling these channels and essentially recreating what we already have
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:33:56
This is it. Why are people happy with these fees?
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:26:39
Go to your CEX wallet’s address on blockchain and see if it has gone anywhere? - I imagine it’s just an unconfirmed transaction
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:14:20
If there’s no issue with centralisation then what’s the point in crypto? Exactly the overcharging point, as well as the single point of attack
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:30:44
Or BCH where it’s. £0.01 transfer fee, anything but visa

We’re talking extremes here, but that still would only let you spend up to your salary annually - what happens if you’ve got millions worth of Fiat but can only spend ~50k of it a year? To add to it, you’re beginning to run into money laundering territory at that point which is a bigger risk than IRS alone
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:42:40
Lmao, it’s your choice what you do kid.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:40:01
True, but then try and buy a car or house - it all becomes more and more difficult. Don’t get me wrong I’m wildly against the concept of being taxed on bitcoins but trying to cheat the system is just a way of getting screwed for the sake of paying money on a capital gain
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:13:52
I sold today too - have a lot of faith in the blockchain but not confident of where core are directing bitcoin nor the amount of uneducated speculation that’s happening at the moment. Confident blockchain technology has a long way to go but much more in the ethereum space than bitcoin so have chosen to sell.
The high fees and slow speed are what’s made it lose for me - it’s cheaper and faster and just as viable to invest in other cryptos at the moment.
That’s not to say bitcoin is rubbish or that we’re in a bubble, just that I believe it’s overvalued at present and would prefer to invest elsewhere

If you don’t wanna pay taxes, move to the Ukraine. If you want any of the amenities that your nation provides you then pay your taxes - it’s not hard

You’ve not limited his risk, you’ve just taken all the risk on, for a 25% reward 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:36:32
This works until you eventually convert back to fiat 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:02:43
9%? Holy shit your trading of cryptos almost beat my index tracker, never mind the 000%s of how the crypto space grew this year 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:02:52
Seems dumb from your end. Let him invest in what he wants to, and if you’re wanting to expose yourself to a 1:4 margin call, why don’t you just leverage trade yourself?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:35:11
So pay your taxes then? It’s fair enough to be against taxes, but your choices are to vote against them or move yourself - why don’t you just not pay your electricity bill aswell? Fuck those things.
You’ll likely see yourself getting into a lot of unnecessary trouble in later life if you avoid paying your taxes and start making a lot of money 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:19:00
Nope no BCH for me either 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:57:26
That’s odd, have you just set it up now? Might need to get verified first 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:04:30
You'll have 10 BCH on your trezor

Cashtipper is a legitimate thing on the subreddit

Get a revolut and do a SEPA that way - alternatively transfer to coinfloor and withdraw there via BACs
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:12:00
Why is it strange that they'd have to buy at the same price as you and I? If anything they'll have to pay more to be able to buy the quantity that they want. All they'll do is contact the exchanges directly to have them manually execute the trade correctly instead of having to go through the months long process of getting verified to trade $2000
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:39:39
Still a lot of people do it
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:32:20
In short yes, there’s a capital gain which is taxable - if you can log every purchase you made initially then you can work out your taxable gain on each coin - head to r/ukpersonalfinance to get a more in-depth answer :)

Are exchanges hack-proof now? /s
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:29:47
Great video thank you! can you place a limit buy/sell not at the market price? Or does it have to be at the order book top price?
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:07:58
You mean like withdrawing cash from an ATM?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:06:20
I've been memed :(
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:44:14
Not a bitcoin supporter but interested into how you can call it a ponze scheme? Surely gold is the same? Or any other asset class valued from market forces
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:05:47
What's the point? If someone wants to pay in fiat to someone who wants to sell in fiat then why introduce Bitcoin and eat up the fees?
On the other hand if someone wants to buy in fiat and the seller wants to sell in Bitcoin, then you have something - though I can't see it being cheap and would fall under a lot of difficulties (may be easier for the seller to have a fiat account on your platform and then a withdraw via Bitcoin which would just use any of the exchanges APIs - though they'd need an account)
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:59:10
Look it up - that's how people who do know, know

I can smell my trezor - I get your point and agree that banks are likely to push against it for the reasons you've highlighted, but what you're now saying isn't that bitcoin is doomed, just that it's going to be a tough challenge to unsettle fiat - I'm sure it was difficult to move from a horse to a car but as cars became more available and fuel was easier to get than hay and cars got faster, people got involved. Crypto is the same - the most impressive use I've seen people using it for currently is cheap international transfers of wealth. If it is unquestionably better and slowly develops to be more accessible it will take over - whether you think it has the ability to is purely a matter of opinion and is as much of an investment question as to whether you think apple is going to go up or down tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:39:05
I'm not a bitcoin supporter but God you're dumb
Do you think even 30% of the people who use a credit card understand the financial tool beneath it? Or actually understand what visa do?

Ask someone in the 60s what a credit card was, it’s the same thing - new technology. I’m not saying bitcoin is the future or that I support it, just that your argument is fundamentally flawed because you can’t imagine a different financial vehicle being used - gold turned to coins, coins turned to paper, paper turned to numbers on the internet and now there’s a potential for those numbers to be a slightly less convoluted set of numbers on a screen

Excellent thank you, I was concerned that I'd need to know my BIP 148 key as if it were something different 
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:12:46
Thank you :)
