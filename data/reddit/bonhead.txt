Recent BTC investor - thanks subreddit for showing me the ropes re Trezor etc.
I have a question though - I'm trying to add a Bitcoin payment option to my online store which is hosted by Big Commerce. I've spent a bit of time trying to work it out and can't get anywhere. I'm really just after an option for people to pay via btc calculated at the time based off a usual fiat invoice - the btc we would accept would then just stay as BTC in that account and wouldn't need to be cleared as fiat. Anyone have any ideas or had experience with Big Commerce and Bitcoin payments?

You guys are aware you're just watching the hedge funds play their games now right.. unfortunately they're already in control. All the new whales in the market, the ones with over 1B USD wallets - take a minute to guess who they are..

Would love to see a poll of the community here and how it stacks up to the wider demographic  [ 
For me I am  - just diversifying (basically holding for FOMO) - hats off to all the early adopters and those that hodled with conviction back when it was &lt;$100.

I also recently bought my first coin too and did exactly this. The great community here helped me out as well. Buy a Trezor from their actual website (they ship globally).

Well done to you sir

Thanks very much - I'll see if I can make it work with them. Big Commerce isn't on their list of intergrations so it'll have to be custom.

Awesome mate! Thanks for the info! I'm now using wallet of satoshi. It took approximately 30m to transfer btc from coinbase to WOS. And then roughly 15s to tranfer from WOS to reddit. To be honest I thought it would be quicker but that isn't too bad. I wonder how long it will take until it will just be tap n go like eftpos and mass adoption happens.

Thanks - maybe you can help me? I tried to deposit some funds into the bot but my coinbase wallet won't recognise the QR? Is this cos it's the LN? I'm new to this sorry! Once I figure out the deposit I'll tip in kind :)

This. I've been thinking about this a lot lately. One of the major reasons communism failed was due to corruption and inneficiencies in the system. Future AI/machines will govern and allocate resources effectively to solve this and we can create and enjoy a truly fair society if we agree to live under the control of the AI. In this world Bitcoin wouldn't exist sorry... Or if it did the AI would own them all as a reminder of the perils of our past society of greed or the function of bitcoin would be used by the AI as some form of balloting system for leisure activities.

Can't argue with this.
