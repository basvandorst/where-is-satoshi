You are right, it is a bit easier to double spend now. But in most cases you would instantly send the conflicted transaction to different nodes than the original, which would be very low fee in order to simulate delayed block inclusion.
At some point this all becomes a cat-and-mouse game between 0-conf payment providers and double spending providers. If the market is there, blackhats will create more exploits. It doesn't have to be that way.
By the way, non-retail 0-conf still works great in some cases. For example, paying a massive AWS bill with 0-conf would not be a problem. If you successfully double spend it, they can deny you service and/or sue you for fraud. They have your info anyway.

There is a reason why there's a difference in price. If unrestricted arbitrage were possible the prices would (almost) equalize.
The catch here is that either Paypal or the Venezuelan bank can freeze your bank account and then you'll lose everything. So the price difference reflects the risk premium.

It's an improvement over running it natively but still way less secure than a dedicated airgapped machine.
A potential malicious application with root access on the host may be able to read Virtualbox's memory and pick out the private key. The guest OS, if unencrypted, may even leave the key on its swap file - on the host's .vdi file.
Also, how will you sign the transaction? Key strokes? These can be keylogged on the host.
You also mentioned copy paste over the VM. That is a huge security breach in that both host and guest can monitor and read each other's clipboards - all thanks to the guest additions.

Yes, something like that. But you can end up with a higher "balance", which you can't do with a tab. And your security is guaranteed because both parties use cryptographic commitments in order to handle their payments. You also get routing between different "bars" so you can transact with other people as well.
Another way of thinking it is that it's like a read/write cache. You can read/write to a single block of a slow network drive a million times but all you're doing is changing a few bytes in the RAM. Then it gets synced to the drive.

@_date: 2017-03-16 12:26:20
100% correct.
0-conf has **always** been double spendable. There are ways to reduce the risk through well-connected nodes and miner cooperation, but that increases centralization and still doesn't eliminate the risk. In Bitcoin, solutions that aren't cryptographically secure aren't interesting.
The **"0-conf is good enough for my cup of coffee"** argument: I don't think that your daily coffee transaction needs to be on the blockchain. I don't think that every node in the entire network needs to process, verify and store your coffee transaction until the end of time. This just doesn't scale on a broadcast network like Bitcoin as we get closer to global adoption.
The blockchain is a shared resource that needs to be small enough to avoid centralization, it cannot possibly store everyone's coffee, uber ride, cinema ticket, bubble gum purchase. The correct (and only) technical solution here is to bunch up your 1000 coffee transactions, 500 uber rides, 500 fast food payments over the past year and settle them cryptographically on the network, which exactly what LN does. As a plus you also get secure instant transactions.
With that said, block size will have to be increased eventually - but not by BTU, it's a terrible and insecure piece of dog poop.

It makes zero sense to buy a coffee on the blockchain. Every node has to broadcast your transaction, verify it and then store it for all eternity when it gets mined. I don't want my coffee transaction stored forever and I don't think it deserves petahashes of power securing it. If everyone starts doing that then you end up with multi gigabyte sized blocks and datacenter-only nodes. Then there's the confirmation time which - an average of 10 minutes - may take up to an hour or more.
It makes perfect sense to bunch up all my coffees, uber rides, cinema tickets, chewing gum purchases over the past year and settle them on the network using a bidirectional channel closure. As a side effect I get cryptographic guarantees (efficiently using all those petahashes of security) and instant confirmation times. That's what LN is about.

As much as I hate BU for the buggy turd that it is, the remote assert crashes were pretty benign as far as bugs go. Mainly inconvenience for end users since miners are running Core (or BU not public reachable).
There will be blood in the streets if the following classes of vulnerabilities were to be exploited:
* **Remote Code Execution:** imagine an attacker running arbitrary commands on your system. Well, I don't need to say more.
* **Consensus Failure:** imagine a specially crafted transaction or block that causes most nodes to lose their shit and  forks them into 2 (or more) chains. It happened before with BerkeleyDB. Emergent ~~Clusterfuck~~ Consensus complicates this even more.
The above 2 bugs **will cause loss of funds**.

As far as brute forcing goes check out vanitygen. In essence it does exactly that. Ballpark figures are 20 million attempts per second on a decent GPU. Then you need to take into account for the key stretching that Electrum adds.
You don't even need to query a block explorer since you can easily fit the UTXO set in RAM and query that in nanoseconds.

This is a point that should be repeated over and over again. Bitcoin is securing $20B. It is the biggest and most mature cryptocurrency by a large factor. Anything other than conservative and tested-to-the-point-of-insanity changes should be reserved for altcoins or sidechains.
The other subreddit is spinning the recent malleated txs as a failure of segwit. Aside from the total lack of logical reasoning, let me point out their solution: Flexible Transactions, another **hard fork**, which wouldn't even totally fix malleability anyway because to do that, you have to completely ban old transactions. This is high blood-pressure inducing level of nonsense.

No it's not.
1) Ethereum has a benevolent overlord. The chain he is going to be developing on is the 90% chain. Proof of Vitalik.  
2) Ethereum was 1 year old when the fork happened. They are still debating fundamental protocol issues for fucks sake.  
3) Ethereum had less than a 1/10th of the market cap of Bitcoin.
You can't compare the two because Bitcoin is no longer an experiment.

In theory you'd lose half of your security bits ie. going from 2^132 to 2^66 . So it's 2^66 times easier to brute force.
Electrum also adds some key stretching rounds but I'm ignoring that for the sake of simplicity.
As a point of reference, the recent Google collision attack on SHA1 performed in the order of 2^63 operations.

If it's a normal 1-input, 2-output transaction, your fee is around ~20 satoshis/byte, which is a bit on the low side. It might get in the next hour, the next day, or expire in the mempool. You can't really predict it.
If you make it 5 times bigger, it will get confirmed in the next 2-3 hours on average.
If you make it 10 times bigger, it will most likely be included in the next block.

They actually have a chance of finding a collision. It only takes in the order of 2^80 (or more *) work. You can thank the birthday paradox for that. It wouldn't actually mean anything. It's just that they will have created 2 private keys that produce the same address.
By comparison the bitcoin network has performed ~2^87 operations.
Now, preimages are what you need to be afraid of and these take 2^160 work. Barring insecure private keys, on the 11 million addresses with funds that's ~2^136 operations.
*: Might take anywhere between 2^81 to 2^84 depending on the time-memory tradeoff used. You can't possibly have 2^80 of storage.

PoW algorithms have to be treated as black boxes. Block header goes in, hash comes out. An atomic operation. Increment nonce until a target value is reached. Anything else is unintended behavior.
In that sense ASICBOOST violates proof of work. A theoretical attack on SHA256, for example a partial preimage attack, would world in the exact same way, by breaking open the "black box" to its constituents and circumventing certain operations.

That's nice, but there is no technical solution currently available in order to do this. If it can be done on a GPU which is a sort of general purpose vector multiprocessor, then it can be done much faster on an ASIC with custom silicon.
The best you can do is a [memory latency sensitive POW algorithm]( where the best theoretical ASIC is just a bunch of DDR4 memory sticks so the advantage over a PC is not that large. Keep in mind this is a recent development so the research and literature are lacking on the matter.
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:05:26
If it's not on a miner's mempool it will never confirm. But then again some of them might be running custom software so it might. But don't bet on it.
Try importing the private key(s) on wallet software that doesn't violate common relay policy and you should be able to retry the transaction you linked. Basically anything other than blockchain.info.
If you do that, all other transactions that depend on it will be dropped. This is why accepting 0-conf is dangerous.

One of the output addresses is yours. Electrum has a "Send from" feature that allows you to spend from a particular address. Send the remainder back to an address you own using a fee of 0.0006. Miners using CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) will mine both your transactions.

Your transaction is spending unconfirmed inputs from what looks like a massive unconfirmed chain.
It's totally insane that in 2017 one of the most popular wallets (blockchain.info) doesn't even warn you when you try to do this.
It will probably all be confirmed in one go, but if the chain is longer than 20-25 other nodes won't relay it so you have to manually push each transaction by yourself.
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:29:08
Don't get me wrong, BU/EC is poop and Bitmain is shady as fuck, but I don't think you can use the empty blocks as  evidence for Bitmain using covert ASICBOOST.
The only time AntPool produces empty blocks is when they solve a block a few seconds after the previous one. That's most likely due to lazy/inefficient programming. It could even be an optimization with regards to time needed to verify the previous block. BitFury and other miners manage to fill blocks even in this scenario regardless.
If AntPool used Option 1 their empty blocks wouldn't be so closely correlated to small time deltas between blocks.

There are multiple posts **per day** about unconfirmed transactions because of blockchain.info wallets.  
For example:  
* They ignore common relay policy. For example they allow users to set a 1 satoshi fee. These transactions might never be relayed or mined yet they will show up on your wallet.
* They treat zero-conf as readily spendable without so much as a warning, leading users into trusting 0-conf which you should never do. People have lost money over this.
* They allow you to build massive unconfirmed chains on top of transactions that will never be mined causing the whole stack of transactions to be dropped.
As far as security goes they are still a centralized web-based service. The fact that you have your private keys doesn't matter much if that centralized service can be hacked and serve you javascript that ships off your private keys to a server in Bangladesh.
