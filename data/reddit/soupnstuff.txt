What haven't you liked about them recently? I'm mostly a hodler but don't want to get burned next time I go to make a transaction.

Same principle as the rest of the financial system really. If all the Amazon stock holders wanted to sell tomorrow it wouldn't be worth what it is today.

That would make for an awful system. We need taxes in society. What happens when companies switch to 100% Bitcoin and also don't pay taxes. See ya hospitals, roads, police, fire, international trade, the army etc.

An article google sent me today was headlined "game over for Bitcoin? Steam drops crypto currency and could spell the end'.
This was as it was going up hundreds of dollars by the hour. The media is annoying...

Ya definitely a lie but atleast the message is there.

Quadriga eats the miner fee for transferring out to your wallet. 1.5% fee to load fiat on instantly (or free if your willing to wait a few days/week for money to transfer) and .5% to buy/sell so 2% from start to finish. Check them out.

I brought out my nano and brought all my coins to the exchange. I sold my Litecoin at 220 cdn as it was crashing and it instantly went up to 250. Would have sold my BTC if I wasn't waiting for the confirmations. Instantly felt like an idiot and rebought my LTC at 230 paying a 1/2 Ltc stupidity tax. I needed to move my BTC to a  segwitt wallet anyway so not a total loss I suppose.

Ya all that stuff is stupid. Society would be amazing with no central government at all. Everyone for themselves! Tribes ftw!

I think this just depends on if you can pay your rent of the price drops to 50% tomorrow. If you cant, bad idea. Sell now. If you can pay via another method then no harm in hoping you make some money. It's just like any other volotile / risky investment. It's better to play it out long term but you can definitely have short term gains.

Very true but let's face it, if the entire market collapses worldwide then Bitcoin isn't going to be surviving and we are going to have a whole set of problems much worse then worrying where to invest.

I've increased mine when I've done it but I've only bought and sold twice. Both major peaks and dips and j only did it with 10% of my BTC. To many fees involved with doing it often and I only like keeping a minimal amount on an exchange. The rest stays in cold storage :).

He plans on starting his own sports car company....when he has the money.

For a single company or a market over a short period of time  you can't look at past performance. For the entire economy over a significant period of time (30 years) there has always been growth.

Why can't we compare oranges to apples? They are both fruit, taste sweet, have skin etc. I think they are very comparable! Comparing apples to apples would be boring. Same dam thing!

Definitely hasn't. It's just starting to get mainstream attention but hasn't gotten mainstream adoption yet. Still  long way to go and some problems to figure out before you can call it a solid investment. Right now it's still speculation. Don't get me wrong I own Bitcoin and want it to do well but my retirement fund is diversified in index funds. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:11:07
Don't forget fees eat up a lot of these spikes. Especially if.you don't time it perfectly

No way. It's going to be a special Christmas. The year he got a PlayStation! I'm 31 and I still remember the year I got my n64. My parents normally would never spend more then 50-100 dollars on gifts for us but that Christmas we got spoiled. When you have kids it's all about creating special memories for them. That trumps Bitcoin gains any day.

If piles of dog shit could be trades for other goods and services and I thought i was getting a good value then yes I would. The whole value of any sort of currency is that we as a society believe in it. That goes for both Bitcoin and fiat. If we believed in dogshit collectively then that would work as currency as well.
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:48:04
Currency is based off belief and trust in a system and had been since the inception of it. It really doesn't matter what the medium is. Over history we've used gold, paper, metal, beads, rocks , paper ledgers and now  digital record keeping. Dog shit would work just as well if we wanted it to.
The point is if 99% of Bitcoin was hoarded then the market would adjust so the 1% was spendable. The people hoarding the 99% would eventually reach a point where they wanted to spend/sell some and the price would adjust to having 2% in circulation etc etc.

Sure hope he doesn't accept Visa. I'm a MasterCard man and I can in no good conscious shop at a retailer that takes visa.

I wish Canadians could do that :(
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:30:22
I hope he sells today and pays off the loan. I'm all about buying Bitcoin if you can afford it but leveraging your house on a single volotile investment is a terrible idea. Way to much risk. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:07:13
Not to worried. Just kicking myself I didn't buy at 2800 when I had the money ready and just didn't pull the trigger. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:58:25
Wow that's security test is pretty cool. I'm skeptical by nature  but know almost nothing about security and just thought that if someone bought a ton of nanos from the company, fiddled with them and then stole everyones Bitcoin in a few years down the road it could be pretty profitable. I like that I can authenticate it after I receive it before putting any coins on :). 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:18:53
That's a ludicrous argument. The amount you use to buy and sell Bitcoin isn't even measurable. The amount you spend to mine it is the same cost as the Bitcoin you are receiving. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:00:56
Bastards. Ive tried to do a lot of reading about it but I still don't fully understand the whole fork process. Do I end up with two different Bitcoin currencies after? One from before and one with the new one? How do I got about claiming it if I have the coins stored on a nano or trezor? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:52:18
You mine 1 Bitcoin worth  $1 today and spend $1 in electricity to mine it.. Next year that Bitcoin is worth $5. You've made $4 (minus what you spent on the rig)
You buy one Bitcoin for $1 today. Next year it's worth $5 . You've made $4. No cost on rig and no time consumption. 
Bitcoins value tomorrow effects neither of these equations.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:06:57
That's my point on the above comment.... I'm calling his argument about taking into account the electricity cost to log onto a regular pc and buy Bitcoin from an exchange ludicrous. The mining electricity cost is what matters 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:35:16
That's exactly what you said and the point of the whole discussion. I'll let you figure it out on your own....

Nice! How did you acquire yours?

I've been checking out both in the last week or so and I will probably go with the nano. I noticed on Amazon it ships out of Japan but through the official website it's out of France. Is there any concern the Amazon products could be tampered with or should I be ok as long as it's coming sealed? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:51:49
I'll check out krakken. Coinbase just seemed like the easiest, least sketchy option with the lowest fees I could find of the different options I looked at. Definitely want to bring my coins into my own possession in the near future 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:28:42
Its only giving me the options to link cards right now. Glad to hear I'll have the bank account option though. I'm Canadian if that makes a difference.
