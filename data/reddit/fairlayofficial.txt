Thanks. A block size increase to 2mb is desperately needed. 0.2mBTC

Well unless you can use it offchain.  With Fairlay you can:  
* send it to someone else via email  
* tip someone on twitter  
* exchange it to an altcoin and withdraw it  
* play dice with it  
* place a bet

0.1mBTC thank you for bringing this up. The reasons cannot be solely technical. As a small player we enabled SegWit months ago and it only took us a few weeks.

If you happen to get through you usually get  "Service currently disabled. Please try again later."

100% agree.

Hope you will like it! To get you started... 0.3mBTC    
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:26:37
It would be nice if you could give it a try and tip someone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:14:22
Sure there is a blog post about it  on blog.fairlay.com
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:36:11

The hitbtc BTC/USD price ticker is at 850 USD right now. Prices at dubious exchanges, which do not pay out citing ludicrous reasons, should be handled with caution.

Are you willing to put your money where your mouth is? We are offering, to put up a bet over a significant amount of BTC between you and Roger.  If Roger should be able to proof to an independent arbitrator, that your statement (he is profiting somehow from a deteriorating  crypto market share of Bitcoin) is false, he will win the bet. Otherwise you win.

1mBTC  = 1 USD   used to be easy. But unfortunately these times are over.  0.1mBTC
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:17:26
just for withdrawal
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:45:01
"could" - by default you have deflation and a couple of other awesome properties. With fiat you have a guaranteed loss!
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:25:48
It's not trustless. So do not use it for very large amounts.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:43:06
0.1mBTC   Through offchain payments hopefully...

Best you try it out yourself. 0.1mBTC
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:54:00
YW. Liked your post. People are a bit harsh around here. Not many shows make it into the 11th Season.

Any translation?

Love it! 0.2mBTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:20:59
What alternative is there?   Keeping your money in fiat, which you know is going to be worthless some day?
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:22:53
0.1mBTC   Unfortunately it's to expensive to send money on chain.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:55:01
Yeah very similiar. Except this is just a minor feature of Fairlay.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:26:10
Very important question.  Bitcoin is transforming from a system that is mainly secured by inflation  to a system that solely is secured by tx fees.  Pushing transactions off chain might be dangerous. 0.2mBTC

Here are the details again:
Unfortunately, our users are rather reluctant in betting on long term markets that aggregate important and extremely useful informations for society.  To motivate betting on our   market, we will give out 2x 50mBTC. We will distribute this to the two users belonging to one matched order above 10mBTC  according to certain predefined terms.    The sha-256 hash of the terms is  
We reserve the right to exclude anyone that we suspect to have manipulated this promotion.
This promotion runs until June 1st 2017 and will also be settled at this date. The orderid that is closest to a predetermined value, according to some predetermined measure, wins.
