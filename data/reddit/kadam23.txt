I Hate It When People Say This. They act like the whole USA wakes up in one shot. USA has many different time zones.  Hours in differences. Literally people are waking up every hour of the day.

So your bit coins will never go down. It'll just be worth less 
If you have 1 bit coin that was valued at 18kusd yesterday 
You will still have 1bitcoin today, it'll just be worth wayyyy less

Thank you, after readable consideration I have decided to option3. Ultimately creating the glitch to disappear. I now have both lite coin and eth successfully bought. Thank you r/hookthem. You guys are really good over there at coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:20:30
[Serious] question. 
So I don't say how much bit coin I have. But I do say I have bit coin. 
Does that not put me at the same risk of a "hack"?
Or say someone were to know there is 10 individuals who he can "hack" but don't know the amount of Bitcoin the 10 individuals have. What makes one less hackable than the other? 
And wouldn't the hacker just take lucky pokes at people even if they don't know how much is there? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:11:39
Watch the Chinese movie called "bit coin heist" it's comical but nevertheless interesting to see how criminal and governments act in the movie against bitcoin.. there is this scene in the movie where, there is an exchange happening. 3000bitcoins were sold for 800k... Lol!!!!

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:38:28
Read side bar 
Read all stickies 
Go watch banking on bit coin
Go download coin base 
Go deposit 500$ in it
Come back with questions 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:28:06
Neat! Did you do a live spot price right there?

Look how many times Zimbabwe did it. Now they're at 1trillion.. and tats total defeat 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:16:12
According to the script, by 2020 we should see about 40k and over 100k only 4 years after. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:51:35
Deployed? Best thing to do right now is download coinbase. God I hope you have an active debit card. If so. Drop whatever you're willing to lose on it right now. Whether it be 500 or a grand. Preferably a grand. Next; go to the sidebar of this subreddit. Go to community info and read the side bar, read the intro, read the how to. DON'T STOP READING. On your free time watch the bitcoin documentary on Netflix, there's only one right now. If you don't have Netflix PM me ill give you my user and password. If you've gotten to this point, all that's left there to do is just gain knowledge on bitcoin. There's gonna be a shit ton of questions you're gonna have. Google them or look for repeated questions in this subredit. Again. please read the sidebar. 
Goodluck 
And thank you for your service

Who is Satoshi nakamoto?
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:12:23
Like Satoshi, gold can be broken up in to much smaller fractions.  Gold price is represented by a whole kilo. Today a whole kilo goes for 42,183USD. you can choose to get a smaller amount that is broken up to ounces. There are 32.15 ounces in a kilo of gold. So today you can also purchase one ounce of gold  for 1,296USD. However, it doesn't stop there because just like Satoshi you can buy even smaller numbers. There. There are 31.grams  in a whole ounce of gold. Leaving you with the option to purchase an even smaller fraction of 1 gram at the price of 41.68USD.  Gold is currently purchasable via the stock market. And it's prices is backed by physical gold bulluons stored around the world.

That was cute how 13k peeked it's face a little..playing hide and seek with 25k HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:14:03
Cash out? Is that one of those new crypto currency?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:41:19
I'm highly upset with coin base. First it stops selling and buying bitcoin when we had the 19k rocketship. Now it has stopped ETH and LTC when it's going to the moon. This isn't fair. And highly defeats the purpose.

@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:58
I jumped out of bed to run to the bank to deposit cash to buy more! My dad is literally holding me back, literally with his hands and all might 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:21

@_date: 2017-12-19 04:28:05
This is cringe worthy
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:14:50
I couldn't wait to come here and tell you all today I accepted my third payment at the pizza store! My customers are starting to slowly ask more and more about bitcoin. Might consider posting it publicly

G Dax just crashed and is froze at that 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:07:37
Congrats! As I am writing this it's already at 14k!! So look at you making some profit already. Keep in mind please not to invest recklessly. Don't freak out when you see price drops, we like to call these "sales" usually it's smart to buy when you see a big dip. But always keep on eye on it. Don't freak out when this Happens, the jump back up will be worth it. Remember bit coin can be worth 5$ tomorrow or 50k but from the looks of it its not gonna crash that soon. Don't cash out and HOLD
HODL= someone typed HOLD too quick and somehow the bitcoin community favored the word HODL and it became a thing. 
Pm if there's anything else I can answer. But by no means am I expert

What the heck with everyone selling. This isn't the point of bitcoin, this isn't the point of crypto currency, cash out? And go back to cash? Wattheheck.jpg
