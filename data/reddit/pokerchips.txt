It's also worth noting that BTC-e and Stamp have changed less than 2% in the last 24 hours (probably from Apple's blockchain news) -- barely anything in the Bitcoin world.
MtGox prices haven't meant anything for months!

If we assume that all teams are equally likely to win or lose a match, then the odds of winning are a bit less than 1 in 10^13.
Of course some teams are favored so this isn't really accurate, but it gives you a good idea of how long a shot this is.

Surely your brokerage account is charging you some sort of commission on the USD / CAD trade?

Oh absolutely, it definitely has its place and I've used it a few times. It's also one of the easiest ways to buy BTC on credit.
I just wanted to make sure OP was aware of the fees beforehand.

Could someone ELI5 what this service is?
Is it a hosted wallet / exchange / something else?

VirWox is very convenient, but probably the most expensive option available in terms of fees:
1. Paypal takes a 3.5% fee
2. USD -&gt; SLL is 3.9%
3. SLL -&gt; BTC is 3.9%
4. Cashing out BTC costs you 0.005 (!!) BTC.
So on a $1000 order you are paying about $115 in fees.

Wow, 125% markup. I feel sorry for anyone who buys there!

Anyone interested in the odds of this (lets assume that matches are coin flips):
We need to pick the winners / runners up of the group stage first. 4 teams per group. The odds of guessing the winner and runner up is 1 in 12 (4 permute 2). 
There are 8 groups, and then 14 matches. So the probability of guessing each right is 1 in (1/12)^8 * (1/2)^14 = 1 in 2.82*10^13 .
Good luck.

Or just go browse the bitcointalk gambling subforum. For the last month or two the whole thing has been littered with people advertising their own ponzis (of course, labelled as such).
A lot of them are literally just a blank page with an address.

No, someone selling crack and heroin on a street corner does not deserve life.

MPOS is what a lot of altcoin pools use. There is a guide to setting it up included in the documentation.

Then the keys will match, not be a collision.

Wow, those are really bad odds.
On 4 mines per row, you are paying 20-1 on a 1 in 3125 shot.

One that I think a lot of people forget about is VirWoX (the second life exchange).
Some positives:
1. Excellent track record
2. You can use paypal / credit card to fund your account
3. Don't actually need a second life account
1. Need to convert USD --&gt; SLL --&gt; bitcoin, so you're paying a commission twice.
2. Low volume
3. Very low limits for new accounts

I'm sorry to say it, but there's not much you can do.
Paypal, Neteller, Skrill, Ebay, Interac transfers, Credit cards, and pretty much any other electronic payment you can think of is always going to be reversible. NEVER sell bitcoins for these methods if you have no other means of recourse.

It's only been about a week at this price...
It was at the same price for half a year in 2012, and was around $110-ish for months after the April crash.

Is there an action point leaderboard?
