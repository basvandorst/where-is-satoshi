How do you buy? I’ve looked around and Bitfinex, the only place that seemingly sells them is severing US ties...

Mine wasn’t drug addiction, I needed my adderall but getting in to see a doctor here in the states is expensive and the prescription at the time was about the same price per month w/o seeing a doctor. I know I’m ADD I don’t need to spend 3 grand on a test to prove that again. Anyways I feel you. I spent upwards of $800 in BTC, now worth quite a bit. Kicked myself for a long time

Like groceries and food. Putting money on a gift card or loading the prepaid card.

They have apps for it now that make it simple (e.g. Stockpile)

Why wont it reach those levels again?

It's crazy that people would make this stuff up, but here proof and thank you! I hope it really does grow even half of what people are projected it to grow to.

I had lost my job, my stash of BTC is all I had left. Between a newborn and other expenses I felt the need to take some out and use it. You're right though.

This has been my biggest qualm lately. Had been using Bitcoin for everyday transactions, I can no longer do so. The fees are pretty awful right now
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:15:28
Yikes. I never looked at it that way. I just always just figured BTC would rally back to pre-high levels before slowly climbing again, rather than shooting up like crazy as it had before.

How so?

I was that person up until last year. This guy at my school was talking about it in 2013 and I blew it off. It wasn't until I actually looked into it when I had my "oh shit, this could be huge" moment. Better late than never
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:38:46
Working on that. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:06:18
Nope, it's not. Do your research before diving in. If you don't start you'll regret it later.

Ah, I see. Newbie here, just figured I'd ask.

Gemini is wonky though. It'll let some people sign up and deny others for unknown reasons.
