If you aren't you should. Best way to integrate new vocabulary.

I encourage you to look into the currency shift happening in Venezuela right now. People are moving, by necessity rather than speculative investment, to Bitcoin and others to restore financial stability. And with this recent price increase, a LOT of people in that country that previously had NO CONTROL over the value of their money and in a very corrupt, oppressive country will now have an influx of wealth they haven't previously seen. People will be lifted out of poverty by Bitcoin, and oppressive governments will lose malicious financial control of those who previously had no option. Venezuela is one of many financial injustices continuing in the world today. I truly believe that cryptocurrencies have the power to give the world stability and balance, and in many cases justice.

I get what you're saying, why even bother even bother Bitcoin if you're just going to cash it out to a bank right? Or anybody that's cashing out doesn't truly believe in the system. But as for right now, the Bitcoin marketplace is a bit lacking, not much can be bought with Bitcoin yet. So for now, if you want to buy something with Bitcoin you often HAVE to cash it out, it's your only choice. So it's less a matter of principle and more a matter of necessity. It's bittersweet because bitcoin gets "used" (but in an a less than ideal way) but you have to go through the enemy to use it.

I like the reference but what are the "channels" analogous to? Do you mean that the infrastructure is in place now but that most retailers and online stores don't accept it as payment yet?
