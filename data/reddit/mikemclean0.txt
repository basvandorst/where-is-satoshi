There is a YouTube upload of a guy buying 5 BTC including transaction fees, for a total of $35 :) Admittedly a few yrs old but what did you pay?

That's where I stopped

I should feel grateful, I suppose. Many thanks.

I remember when the UK government tried to stop Soros. They were buying GB pounds as he and his group sold them short. He won and the pound was devalued. Point is that hedging is so much cheaper than trying to manipulate the value of the underling asset. It's technically possible but impractical.. (unless you are a Soros)

I suppose it would be technically possible to spend a few thousand on futures contacts and then multiple millions to try to force up the price of the asset...

Bitcoin, or any assets price, is independent of the futures market price. The buyer is betting the assets value will rise beyond the strike price during the duration of the contract.

Short covering. It's a serious comment and probably accurate.
