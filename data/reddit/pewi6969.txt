Looking at the site right now, it gives 21212 in the orange bar (unconfirmed) and 27038 in the blue bar (confirmed) for a 100 satoshi/byte fee. The orange bar is nevertheless considerably longer than the blue one with the higher number of transactions. Why?

Yeah, the guy is presented as a "CryptoCurrency enthusiast", which is very distinct from "expert". He also owns "99bitcoins.com"...

Great information, thanks so much!

Thanks for explaining that and the link to the video. I will watch it several times and hopefully catch on. I have no coding knowledge whatsoever! 
Nevertheless, I was referring to this part: *"...Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.
A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year...."*
The "stubbing off branches of the tree" or, as it is called in the accompanying diagram "pruning", has obviously not been implemented and we have the 100GB+ size of the block chain. My question remains: Why is the "pruning" of the Merkle trees in old blocks not done?

*"...So the more bitcoins are worth, the more miners are being actually rewarded for their effort, both in tx fees and newly minted coin."*
That, concerning the fees, would be true, if there were a fixed amount per byte or kb, but there isn't. As a matter of fact, people are already complaining about the high fees necessary to get reasonable confirmation times, so if any percentage is set today, this problem would only increase. Remember the times when fees were voluntary...?

You're a real sweetheart! Kisses and many loves to you!

Thank you very much for this explanation. So, I download the whole blockchain (100GB+). How do I then "prune" the Merkle trees to get most of the disk space back? 
DISCLAIMER: I am not a cryptographer, programmer or geek and do not know how to write code. I'm happy when I get cursive letter here putting the 2 asterisks  ;)
Edit: An additional question I have is: Can I stop and continue the download of the blockchain? If not, my Internet connection will be fully occupied by this download for a long time...

As said above, the guy owns "99bitcoins.com". I just wanted a reality check and see if others could find any truth in that claim/explanation.
