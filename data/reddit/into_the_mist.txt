Actally I'm pretty sure it's to ensure that your order always goes through no matter what. You buy a few points over price to ensure there is someone to sell to you and you sell a few points below price to ensure there's a buyer. The price can move fast and this ensures that the coinbase user is always able to buy or sell. It just comes at a slight cost.

In his defense it was pretty fucking stable for awhile there at $300 lol.

Yeah but those future's contracts don't transact any btc.  They just pay out fiat based on whether it's worth more or not when the contract is up.

You don't have to.  You could just buy and sell at the same price and lose it all in fees :P

So should he have said Southern white trash?  I think hick is probably a little nicer, if you're looking out for stranger's feelings on the internet anyways.

Do you think the price will go up once the futures go live, and if so why?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:22
Why are you so fucking sensitive about this?

I watched 10k get demolished on GDAX.

I can only assume that surpassing 10k somehow satisfies some level on unenvolved institutional investors willingness to play. It's like a free for all now of buying.  Seeing regular buys of 20 or more btc is encouraging.  That's a near 6 figure buy every time that happens.  God damnit I wish I had just held onto my buy at 3.8k. Well, whatever, lesson learned.  This is crazy though.  Green candles as far as the eye can see.

Holding my buys from 9600 and let's see where this goes.  I know I delayed a lot in buying.  Bought into the whole bitcoin bubble will crash and then you can buy in and make a profit.  I was wrong.  I'm not afraid to admit when I was wrong.  Can only learn from mistakes and move forward.

You mean the classic formula for making money?

Foreign (outside the US) investors dumping money in?  I watched a 100 plus wall of bitcoin sells get eaten in literally less time than it took me to write this post.

They said that at 6k.  Look where we are.  The higher the percentage returns will draw big firms to invest.  Then it's game over.  Look at the buys after 10k.  6 figure buys are way more prevalent in the last 2 hours than they had been in the previous 6 months.

wtf is happening...
