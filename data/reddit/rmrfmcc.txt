Lines up with my 6 hour charts which also “predicted” last night mini-dump. The big dump is just hours away. Or it won’t. Either way... I’m hiding in the books down in the 7.5k-8.5k zone.

Get a Ledger. Use Gemini and Bitstamp. Also try bitflyer.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:08:06
Fair enough. I’m relatively new (August 2017).
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:38:36
Was this literally a free tutorial sponsored by CNBC?
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:43:31
Exactly. I’m guessing these are new on-boards not realizing this isnt visa like speed, yet. They don’t understand the earliness of their participation?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:16:00
I’m calling 500 moon-acres. Not there yet...
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:01:42
Lol. Move along with that scam.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:40:28
They have. It’s called the dollar.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:31:21
Very modest values. Very.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:47:27
Weird. You leave the king for alts? Bad move.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:11:18
Good. FBC vs. BTC. Smart money on BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:56:21
My chart has it sitting directly on top of the upper wedge line at the moment. Hard to call the direction of this thing.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:02:19
Sounds like a monster. What are the ramifications on LN? A separate “sidechain” running in parallel with LN and others? If i understand this correctly, multiple sidechains pegged to BTC would scale BTC rapidly.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:27:36
Don’t be cheap.

threw all my money into it and went long. way calm.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:16:39
I won’t sell for anything under $1 million.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:20:42
It was17 weeks until I was miraculously able to move my BTC out of there, and even that ability to move it I suspect was a fluke, as they still have not formally declared my account issue solved - they are still "looking into the issue." They are horrible but I was luckily able to exit more or less unscathed.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:03:13
Damn it. I’ll put another order in at 13101.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:58:38
How many were sold? Hunt down the difference.

Meh. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:16:01
I don’t know. I’m betting that he thinks his junk is worth $1 million. He will pump BTC to win his bet. Win-win.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:44:18
They are bad. Claimed I owed them money and locked my account 19 weeks ago. I did not. I wanted zero hassle so wanted to pay them anyway, 18 weeks ago. The system would not accept payment (all methods would fail). Randomly, I was able to make a payment twice, but even that was goofy. They let me sell them $10 of forked bcash for $127 (idiots), on week 17 on payment 1, then i was able to somehow make another payment a week later. All payments were digital bcash because I wanted to hand them a shitcoin as payment. Emailed me back after all that nonsense saying that they were still looking into my case two weeks after I had already settled said payments.... (how?). Immediately I shipped the remainder of bcash to bitstamp for btc, then unvaluted remainder of btc and sent to wallet.  Still can't "buy" from coinbase (and I won't), and cannot log into gdax. Incompetence. Luckily I was able to exit that clown exchange with minimal damage.

A dart into a black hole is a guaranteed bullseye.

Does it let you partition different set of coins into different folders? Like coin cap does. I like to keep track of different bundles independently.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:11:31
Closed my account yesterday. They are more of a bother than it’s worth.
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:04:16
Try Gemini?
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:47:26
It’s just a matter of time... eventually BTC will not only eat all of the fiat, it will also eat all of the alts.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:08:43
BTC will break the arms of the wicked. Just ask Dimon.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:14:24
Smooth over or create?

The banker’s coin...
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:20:56
Yeah they locked me out for 17 weeks so I dipped out once I was unlocked.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:25:43
Does Conbase holding my crypto and locking me out for 17 weeks straight count as a hack? Insolvent pieces of shit.

used to. but that was when i was staking my early and "large" position. position staked. cards being paid "rapidly." now it is only fiat that finds it way to an exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:16:20
they can accumulate with their printing machine. they don’t need tax collections.

It’s a great read.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:08:56
I feel you on the inflation but how does it inflate if it’s under the table print and buy. I guess it goes into the economy via exchange purchase or something. Fair enough.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:58:25
I’m buying this dip 3 days straight. Holding it up at 13k is getting heavy. Any help appreciated.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:06:19
Hey I was right... it just died off afterward.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:07:19
Closed my account with Coinbase as of today. I’ve been on Gemini and bitstamp for a few months now - way better.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:44:08
Good to see that you are proactive with making legal arrangements to protect your BTC in the event of...
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:13:48
It needs to be three things. Store of value, means of exchange, and unit of account. It’s flirted and flirting with 2 of the 3. It’s final and far off target will be “unit of account.” One complains about temporary fees on an ambitious roadmap like that??
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:58:12
Too little too late BA, you lost another user. Thanks for the free $120 bcash on my way out the door tho... scooped up some of that BTC with it. ��

Feeling a little bit regretful, eh? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 06:37:25

Dang. I was hoping you wouldn’t say that. If it goes to 10k, then at least one can ask “when 100k?”
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:47:42
I’ll buy your coin, bruh. Don’t worry.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:25:36
"better" statement equates to a lack of understanding.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:18:25
I received $10 bcash from fork and they let me sell it back to them for $127. Apparently bcash was worth $25k at some point. Haha. Anyone else benefit in a similar way?

Iron hands waiting down at 7.5k-8.5k. This iron hand bought that weak hands sell at 11.5k, just because.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:46:51
I don’t know about that. A couple of weeks ago the plunge to 10k and back upward was pretty volatile.

Not enough.
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:55:53
I wouldn’t be surprised to see the bots dump it at 4 AM CST candle. They’ve walked it down this wedge in a repetitive pattern. According to what I see it’s 4 AM CST close followed by the dump candles.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:58:18
I’m lurking down there with a buy at 8011. It’s going to sling shot BTC past 10k if these bears come near me.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:18:24
I’ve been surprised that banks and credit cards even allow us to exit via ach/wire to exchanges in the first place. Figured they would make it harder to exit.
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:24:20
That is a very nice looking cup and handle... massive upside.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:04:03
I’m not a pro. I have a Ledger. Never messed with paper or hot wallets. I take off the exchange everything I can when it arrives. Not sure what storage outside of that to use. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:37:03
probably because i closed my account with them after dimon called it a fraud and i told them that was why i was closing my account?

LTC and XMR? That’s my hunch. That’s my focus outside of BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:54:02
Yup. Not to mention they are blockchain roll-backers when it suits.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:06:54
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:47:13
Just had a thought... if you’re right I selfishly hope you are and that it moons to 250k overnight. Haha.

Lol. Somebody give me his wallet address. He has what I want. ��

Does successfully shorting/longing alts for BTC count as earned?

I’m boolish. I say yes.

Not quite. 40k.

@_date: 2018-01-07 00:40:42
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:08:49
Elliot waves and the repetitive patterns that the bots are creating on the charts as we go downward. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:04:38
Might or might not already have one. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:06:40
Yup. 2018 ends at 75k-100k (depending on where we bottom). Bullish... 101k-175k.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:02:46
Sheeettttt..... they say they are useless. I’ll buy them all for $1 per BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:56:49
days and hours, i mean.
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:28:38
But ETH?
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:14:57
Guy (the bear) folded though. He looked weak. Very weak. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:30:00
good to shake out the weak hands and more importantly... the bad actors.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:21:35
Step 1. Send 5 BTC to me.
Step 2. Whatever you want it to be.

“Bulk” being a poor man’s bulk.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:16:22
Biggest question... why not Gemini???
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:21:45
It will.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:38:13
Institutional money more intelligent than “us?” I don’t buy that as an accurate blanket statement. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:30:38
I believe it. They are shit. However... the only weak spot I see in your story is that they let you keep their shirt - they are too cheap. I would believe it fully if they charged you for it on the way out.

“Worry? Why? $3.6 Milllion BTC”
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:18:26
It will be fine. 2k made it out during (was stuck during latest Conbase outage for 24 hours). It made it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:40:57
Works for me.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:55:27
It will be fine if it’s fast.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:17:56
not yet, i don't think. stand atop the candle and hang from the bull’s wick. i'm ready.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:17:12
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:41:35
40k. Still too low. 
65k (95k if btc can get back its cowboy walk).
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:53:29
I’ll leave that shit exchange no matter what once they unlock my account. Going on 17 weeks locked out.

Newbie alert
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:12:47
Yeah. I’m new (August) had no problems until then. From there they just seem to have lost control of their framework. Managed to be in some other exchanges to work around them but it’s not fun having crypto locked on their exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:18:29
Is this old or is he just a broken record?
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:53:05
good luck. that place has zero useful "support." you could be on the bench for a very long, long, long time. better create an account at gemini, bitstamp and as many others as possible in the the meantime. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:52:02
All in all a well-written article. However, I think it goes to 100k a hell of a lot faster than 10 years time. As well as a lot higher than 800k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:08:54
Hmmm... maybe it’s a timing thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:50:05
I am at peace with my offering.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:32:12
Do you happen to know the CME long price for this month?
Maybe my question doesn't make any sense...

Gemini. Conbase is old news.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:09:32
Took an hour to confirm that slow piece of shit called BCASH. 17 weeks locked out of Conbase guy was finally freed! They accepted BCASH as payment finally. What a surprise. Was able to send the remainder of BCASH shit turtle coin off to Bitstamp for more BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:40:51
Which country?
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:11:43
Upward boom the minute after we pass 16k.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:43:39
Due for an upward move looking by eye. 6 hour chart looks ready for upward swing too.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:05:40
They’ve done it to me twice... they are a sinking ship.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:13:39
very bad.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:00:19
Go get some bcash alt, smart guy.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:45:46
Yet it keeps on going up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:07:26
Or do we have one more major fall to 8k?
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:49:47
my body is ready.
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:43:49
That place is such a piece of shit.

I do not miss running Monte Carlo simulations.

Action against Bitcoin. That’s good to spark at least one bullish stretch.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:21:37
It’s one massive cup and handle at the moment. Fractals. Don’t sell. Buy more at the iron price in 7k-8k zone.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:40:30
Then why are these whales trying to shake loose my coins? Right of passage?
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:20:36
I just want my coin THAT I paid for. How do you get yours? In back alleys?

Gemini will credit you up to $500 instantly once you initiate bank transfer, so you can purchase instantly. Once it clears days later you are free to trade or move it off the exchange.

For whatever reason they said I owed the $300 and they locked me down. I was skeptical but after week 1 it was clear paying and getting my crypto was more important to me. Tried to pay via all methods (bank, credit card, crypto), but their payment interface is all jacked up and it wont let me complete a payment. They’ve been looking into it ever since. Constants calls and emails to fix this has got me nowhere. ��

i recall hearing that any user's lost BTC would result in a shirt being provided anyway, with block stream eating the cost. i don't see the problem.

You can put a stop order on bank side for a fee. You will then own Coinbase that money anyway so you’ll end up taking L’s all over the map.

What in the world. It’s consolidation. It’s done this before on 17k. It’s tested 17k, got turned back twice, maybe three times. It’s the same pattern over and over; overshoot, get knocked down, crawl up, test that resistance a few times, consolidate and then punch through and blast past the resistance. Then repeat process. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:13:07
Try Gemini

One of the first videos I watched during my Bitcoin baptism four months ago. After that video I rapidly accelerated my position into bitcoin - I’ll always want more, but man I beat the explosion by getting in at 3300 and rode BTC hard all the way to 5k, back down and back up and past 5k. Still trying to close my position before I’m priced out but the bulk of my coin and relatively low buy-in cost is due to him. He had me seeing the future with focus within 3 days of my first purchase. Being so late to the game I got in early AF because of of him. Props to the emissary of Bitcoin and the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:38:45
I don’t think so. Wallet to exchange fee is on the user I’m guessing 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:04:00
It’s early still, believe it or not. It’s in a funny place at the moment and you could get in possibly at this or a little lower price in a couple of weeks.

how can they 1) openly state an intention to steal and, 2) technically confiscate/hack the blockchain of inactive BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:15:47
First step is to pick an exchange to buy from: Coinbase/gdax, Gemini, or bitstamp etc.

If you used Coinbase, then you have a Gdax account as well. Log into gdax with the same login info as Coinbase  and pull your coin from Coinbase wallet into gdax wallet. That’s instant and free. From there you would send to your hardware wallet. There is an eli5 link floating around here somewhere ( look around on the sidebar thing, maybe it’s there?)

They have to get their funds up, man. Insolvent. 12 week ongoing issue with them (I owe them money, they said). I’ve tried to pay them all ways possible, but the user side won’t let me. Phone calls and emails for 12 straight weeks... constant babble and yeah “we are working on it talk.” Today? Shit they were fast to escalate the case and said it will be working by “next Friday.” They need money. They are insolvent. Wouldn’t surprise me if that little front run with bcash was an attempt to boost their pockets in an attempt to get back to being solvent - and it probably backfired.

Iitecoin is currency. Ethereum is a platform. Fancy, yes. scaling and the token leaches will weigh it down, unless it can stay above water until the market kills off all the pointless ico tokens.. And some other things I don’t like about eth. Litecoin has all the bells and whistles and nobody outside the space knows it yet. It pairs well with btc. When “they” arrive they will drive up the price by buying it because it’s “cheap.” They won’t even know how clean of a coin it is until after they study it. Just my opinion.

Gemini was a pretty smooth experience
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:44:57
I think the point is, if you have spare $x for speculation on BTC, then go full x, not some small fraction of x to test the waters. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:49:28
They will buy.

Yes. Better to purchase on gdax (even though I’ve never used gdax to buy). I’ve used Coinbase, bitstamp, and lately Gemini.

Man I’d rather this don’t do that 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:14:08
BTC volume is low. Not much trading left to squeeze money from. Alts at ATH’s. XRP 70% organic and a good move by Ripple to put out new info to soften the incoming BTC move. BTC whales are preparing shorts on ATH alts.  8-12 hours until the small high-low swaps ceases on BTC, and then the volume (gains on shorting alts) re-enters BTC and the surge to 20k kicks off. That’s my ignorant prediction anyway.

lol. Let it go... you’re not Bitcoin. Go be bcash with pride and focus on the coin creeping up to get you - LTC is going to eat your coin alive while you stand there clueless.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:49:26
Definitely. Dump the trash for LTC or extra BTC. Hard to go wrong with either.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:48:34
Nah. Whales this time. Someone came around an hour ago said “buy btc you will see why tomorrow.” Who knows, I paid no attention to it. About 30 mins later I noticed btrash was pumping. My own speculation is that btrash is getting pumped and dumped and gains will be poured into btc for the coming run to 13.5k.
Or there was a major move in the coffee markets.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:05:08

@_date: 2017-12-03 23:40:27
I’ve been in this space for 4 months now. Got in kind of small and after about 3 days of intense study and reading I accelerated my position as fast as I could, trying to stay ahead of BTC - I could see the explosive potential and maybe ignorantly saw this explosion coming 4 months ahead of time - and my paychecks still can’t keep pace with Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. I am struggling to keep up. Signed, from the frontlines of BTC price action.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:28:15
That’s the bullish approach I’m looking for.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:48:15

Gemini, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and many other exchanges. Which you can utilize depends on geographical region, to an extent (I believe). If you are new, then just browse around this place, there is useful information everywhere. Read everything you can google and watch a lot of YouTube.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:30:10
it does. i just checked.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:02:11
Next few hours no idea. Hopefully it’s done for a day and consolidates around 11.3 or 11.5 for a couple of days then launches through up to 13.5 by the end of the week. Baby steps toward 20k end of year target.

@_date: 2017-12-04 05:55:49
Gemini and or bitstamp are better than Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:47:10
Look. You can either go select a coin that you think will end up being the better store of value, or you can go with the one the market has apparently chosen to be the best store of value at present. In the end, while it will be  a store of value along the way until it gets there, I see it as a storm shelter during the violent conversion to the digital age. Once the storm is over it will not only be worth a lot, but those whom work on scaling will probably have scaled up a network where the people emerge from all of their shelters and the bitcoin will stream seamlessly as a currency, with all of the bells and whistles added on that other cryptos have. Not the only currency, but the strongest currency. 
For the record, my money is on BTC, LTC, and XMR.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:41:05
And really price down your items. BTC holders “know” that it’s going to explode in value and any store will too. If you want to acquire BTC via transaction, then steep discounts are warranted. The store has to assume some risk if BTC goes south, in my opinion. E.g. I would not offer more than 0.25 BTC for a $100k car under current price speculation. That’s just me.

If they have any foresight they will hold it and adopt it.

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:24:02
I don’t get the network problems. I’ve moved btc probably 6-10 times in last 2 weeks with no delay. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:27:55
Because it’s not Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:19:23
I’ll believe that when BTC blasts past 1.5 trillion cap. I don’t even think that will tell you. I think you’ll know it when you see it. I don’t think that is what you see (hyper), right now. I think you see “holy shit, did you see that ghost? I keep seeing that same ghost. It might be a real ghost.”

Sheeettttt. This little slide won’t shake me loose.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:08:19
Definitely some envy and astroturfing involved. Some of them old elites probably can’t stand the thought that an average joe with measly 1-5 BTC stands a chance at being worth 1-3 million USD etc., or has in his/her possession the equivalent wealth and purchasing power of 1-5 BTC if it ever does fully evolve into what satoshi intended.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:15:30
Just a guess. I don’t know. Btc for the win!
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:28:15
Yeah vault it until you get a wallet or have enough that would make you unhappy if it were hacked or whatever.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:25:29
I’m scared to short btc even when I know it’s going to plummet after an ATH

you can trade it for current ratio.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:09:11
Nearly 334 billion in crypto at the moment... 185+ is bitcoin. Probably 1 trillion in all crypto by Christmas 2018. It’s just going to keep eating everything. I don’t see how the fed doesn’t lock up once it’s eaten up all of the money... what happens when it eats everything? I see a conventional market collapse and a flight to the dollar, probably a shit load of crypto exits for the dollar, except holders who eat the loss and buy the straight down dip, then the dollar goes even worse and then fed print a coin that trades against bitcoin (which will probably shoot up 100x whatever it comes down from in a day) and we know how that would end.  Then comes BITCOIN? 
Maybe I should go to bed and I’m out bounds and beyond my pay grade. All the more reason to hold I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:15:34
Gemini front you the coin after purchase. You can’t take it off the exchange for a few days, though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:22:54
No experience with faucet. 
I try to look at it as getting as much coin as possible. While it may be USD Valuable, a decent sized portion of BTC will and should be valuable as a stand-alone. It costs more and more money to buy a decent sized portion. The more you can get the better insulated/advantaged  you may be at some unknown time in the future. Or it could go to zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:09:06
Scummy Coinbase. Have had me locked out of my coins for 12 weeks now.

Your comment should probably be posted at the top of Reddit for newcomers to read. 
In addition, a hyper-high price valuation of a currency in a multi-currency war greatly aids in the absolutely critical commandeering of “territory,” in order to frame-up the new (BTC) monetary system.

No worries. BTC breaks it every time it makes an explosive move upward. At least that’s what I’ve surmised of it.

Gemini or Bitstamp are other options. I’d sign up for all three if I were you. After you have Gemini or bitstamp access I’d leave Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:42:39
The price is locked at the instant you press the buy/sell key.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:12:48
Also... Gemini fees are cheap. I’ve moved over there as of late and I’ve noticed a massive difference. They “credit” you with your bank deposit immediately so that you can make a BTC purchase if you are trying to get in at a nice price and the fees are just lower. Just make sure you have money in the bank account, of course. Might be a good idea to at least start an account with them while you’re at it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:24:41

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:06

Then you don’t want in that badly, it seems 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:16:33
It must eat up all the fiat to get to that stage. 
That’s my reasoning for doing my small part in driving up the price.

Not too late. Expensive. I personally don’t think it’s too late, at all. See the sidebar. Signup at Coinbase, Gemini, or bitstamp exchanges. Many other exchanges exist. Sidebar has a lot of info, I think

I was buying too much dip around 4K and overdrafted. Long story short they said I received coin, but I didn’t. Decided to pay them anyway instead of waste time.  However, bank, credit cards, nor digital payments on their interface will work. 9 weeks of phone calls and emails about how can I pay if the payment methods won’t work...”specialist” are looking into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:51:56
I don’t know, you are caught in the middle of no man’s land at the moment if you ask me. It was testing 11.9k to eventually test 12k and probably crack through it any day now. I expect once it gets to 15k after blowing through 12.5k it will pull  back to 11-11.5k. Not sure what kind of pull back there will be on the test of 12k, but at the end of the 2017 I expect it to get to 19-20k. From there who knows. I expect 30-35k (somewhat conservative) by early summer and 65-90k by next year this time. I could be completely wrong. Those are my thoughts. When one decides to enter... I don’t know.

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:13:23
Typo: didn’t mean to leave the word “bond” in the title.
Maybe it’s still an “unqualified” title and statement. No fear-mongering, just a down range thought on what it would it mean if  BTC were to actually eat all of the fiat.  I also think the mail/email and tv/cable analogies are a little off-base: govt just stops printing as many stamps, there isn’t a need to print unneeded stamps, but as BTC continues growing, it is going to suck up all of the liquidity as BTC and cryptos are increasingly desirable and that’s going to necessarily need more dollars to be printed into existence - and that doesn’t end well.

Then do not go to Bitcoin.com. It’s bcash.

@_date: 2017-12-12 00:45:40
Nah. But my evaluation is that LTC is  coin, followed by  XMR. Ethereum will do well once it shakes free of all those tokens it drags around on its chain - too many. I don’t like ETH.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:38:49
Day 1 being since I got into bitcoin. If BTC goes where I think it goes the 100k car would end up having “cost” me 225k. I think that’s a fair trade.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:53:47
They own your private keys. In your wallet you own your private keys, which will be a different set of private keys than Coinbase.
Since they own private keys at time of the fork the fork coins belong to them until (if) they decide to give them to you.

Just bulls being bulls. There was a few days of hovering around 8k. That to me is just consolidation and forming up positions before the stampede (which is currently ongoing). Has been the pattern for the last 5 weeks I’ve noticed.

Hitting ATH is nice not because it has to “stay there,” but because BTC is showing that it can and it will continue to go higher.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:30:10

@_date: 2017-11-22 15:52:53
Yeah. I think an overrun past 10k, possibly to 11k will, followed by 25-35% retrace then a blast off towards 15k and no drops below 10k unless a major disaster occurs.

It’s easy. It’s doing what it is supposed to be doing. Converting vast sums of fiat into btc. Given there are only roughy 5 million btc in the exchanges, why sell? Make them (myself included) pay premium to gain ownership of a btc. It’s early.

Coinbase is good for on-boarding. If there is ever a mix-up and your account  gets all screwed up then expect massive downtime in your ability to move any of your funds. For three weeks now I’ve been trying to get this sorted out (they say I owe them money but they are wrong), so I’ve been trying to pay them anyway. However... it won’t let me pay using my bank account, it won’t let me pay using coins in my wallet, and it won’t let me load a credit card to pay. Completely shit customer service. How can you pay them if they are not letting you pay them.

Lol man. Told ya. Yeah I’m still waiting for them to get my payment channels open. Going on week 4 on lockdown. I was fortunate in that I had moved the mass of my coins off the day before (Ledger had just arrived), not even knowing their lockup was coming. Heard word today that they are still looking into my issue. ��
Not sure how long it will take you, but if the Channels  to settle payment with them are not working, then all I can do is relay to you that I’m on week 4 and they are very slow in fixing the issue. Hope you can get things sorted out more quickly and your account isn’t as jacked up as mine.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:52:46
LOL man... I “owe” them money (which I really don’t), but I’m trying to pay them anyway. None of the platforms they offer to settle payment are working either. I’ve tried to pay from my bank account, credit cards, and using digital currencies from the wallet. They have my account so jacked up right now - for weeks.

Jesus... wasn’t the correction at 5k that was moving along well enough well enough, before the Chinese bam hammer arrived for three straight weeks? Bitcoin took the blows and exited the building to correct upward. Bitcoin now had/has to endure two consecutive forkings... hopefully bitcoin only decides to touch and consolidate at around 6000-6200 as a correction, then leaps out to about 12k-15k by Christmas followed by an encore with a 20k New Years surprise.

@_date: 2017-11-05 09:29:43
Oh god... they don’t want to loosen their grip on power, either.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:38:37
No way. Fuel tanks are maybe 0.9% filled.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:41:58
Too soon.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:16:08
Nigguh, you just wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:13:55
Jesus. Seriously?
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:14:49
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:21:08
Sounds like they are getting nervous.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:49:06
Wow. I’d look at the contract very carefully.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:12:05
Hope so. Only the 100th tone I’ve seen that posted.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:47:35
I’ll take it. Keeps it lively. Dig the foreword followed up with some Anton. Only about 8 mins in. Haha.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:33:31
Well if on Coinbase I’d at least vault them, if you aren’t going to put them on your own cold wallet.
I use “coincap” to track my gains.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:02:32
I know. BTC shook that guy off around 3k and broke his arm.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:27:25
Probably just a deep ploy by dimon and friends to try to bring about a btc collapse. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:15:13
I wouldn’t give them btc anyway. I’ll give them cotton. Actually, they will give me cotton and I’ll trade it for btc.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:44:40
Lol. Higher!
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:59:57
Ah, I’ve sensed some “astroturfing” around here on a few threads today, honestly. Never mind them, OP. Get some bitcoin and buckle up!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:00:42

my god... bitcoin cash (or clashic or whatever that shitcoin is this week) is a toxic actor. if only satoshi would come back, split his/her/their coins, then rain a massive dump on them for the holidays.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:39:27
Conveniently leaves out the part where they are spamming the btc blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:59:46
LOL. They should just turn the difficulty dial to zero. Mine the remaining 4 million by tonight. They want a full force currency in full circulation... why wait?
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:55:29
Buy when you are sad, sell when you are happy. (Or don’t sell at all)

It used to hit my account within 7 days... I don’t know why it is taking 10+ days lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:17:14
Yeah but I’m asking is she calling bitcoin to go to 6 cents?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:26:36
It’s BTC, not BC!! OK?!?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:56:10
Or not
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:48:39

It’s nearing decision time, again...
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:22:52
I don’t know if it can go 10x in 2018, but I don’t see why it will not be 50k this time 2018. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:24:58
Do they pay wallet to gdax also?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:19:56
Meh. You’re trying too hard, roger.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:04:21
I just use gdax to go to wallet or wherever. Might as well use it if the fees are covered.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:55:53
Note: use gdax next time (“free”).
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:04:36
This forked already, yes?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:33:00
I think it’s multiphase. Buy, spend, establish presence, save and eat all the fiat, then spend when it’s at 1 million per coin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:24:04
Via bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:28:27
The willful intent to not implement replay protection did it for me. That’s a dirty move. Dirty intent.

@_date: 2017-11-04 20:36:19
7497.51 on shit Coinbase inc.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:49:07
Yeah. I was thinking 7.5k was pretty comfortable as a run-up... but it’s going much higher than that now, I think. Hence the deeper bottom now... everyone is going to freak out and sell. Guess I’ll be watching for some bottoms.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:23:31
At least mcafee will win his bet. 
Calaber24p = amateur.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:15:26
More forks  = More bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:32:51
50k (within 2018).
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:43:11
What would you like them to say?
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:27:44
Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:44:22
Pick up some LTC when you can.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:16:51
10k if not more by the end of month. It probably does start moving as early as tomorrow. 
I also want to be wrong (because it will price me out on “large” coin grabs), but I’m feeling 15k+ by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:06:21
Yes. They will have to speculate on the premium.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:41:05
Just another reason (if another was needed) to grab some extra BTC. You can’t beat the crooks if they rig the “fair and honest” system. 
Off with his head... seriously.

@_date: 2017-11-24 18:37:37
Google, man. Really, google has a lot. Or look up Tone Vays website.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:02:59
How many coins were sold in those back to back $100 drops on gdax? Anywhere I can look that up?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:37:06
well... this could get a little awkward.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:57:33
Me, actually. Maybe it’s luck.... but man have I been right as f*ck month after month.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:45:44
The far right column is twisted propaganda.
What do I win? (I only accept BTC)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:35:17
Not on the long. On the long it’s investing.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:23:35
If the stock market crashed BTC would rocket upward at a speed of 0.5 c.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:29:32
any investment in btc to my mind is more than nothing. good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:03:27
Yes. It’s a fun ride.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:16:15

NoT winning your trades?
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:29:34
I don’t think so.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:26:45
Yup. Flipped half dozen LTC to BTC to pick up a little at a rate of 6350 :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:42:54
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:57:32
Best bang for your buck is bitcoin long term. I personally like litecoin as well. Not much into venturing out much further than those. Had some omg and neo, but dumped them to come back to btc with a heftier position.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:20:34
Bitcoin doesn’t ask for a legal status.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:09:59
You would if you didn’t want your 190 usd to continue to devalue before your eyes.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:26:00
i wish... hoping to not be priced out by the market before i can get there lol.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:46:02
Fair enough. I think it’s at 10k before it drops... and the bottom is getting deeper, I feel. Of course it goes up like crazy after it finds its bottom. Wish I knew where the bottom was.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:17:22
No kidding. I liked that guys optimism and outlook back in the day... but he wants even more riches even more quickly. Wonder how much he made on today’s Btrash dumping...
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:42:26
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:45:17
I don’t know. Just my opinion. I’m not being paid to make that decision.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:42:15
Fair enough. That I don’t know. I’m on US side, so I’ve not encountered that situation.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:02:43

@_date: 2017-11-13 12:27:29
Not really. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:12:32
Didn’t buy much. Just enough to legitimately say I bought at the ATH - wanted some skin in the game. My average buy in cost is below 5k.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:43:03
Jay Z, is that you?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:17:49
Hold them. What’s the rush? It’s early.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:57:01
Have patience. You don’t run the “lambo” full speed over a dirt road - you wait until the proper road is built. Unless you don’t care much about the value of your “lambo.”
Plus, bcash is probably spamming while they pump, although I can’t prove that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:35:22
Short bitcoin now and it will wreck you within the next 7 days.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:52:46

I don’t know. Liked the speedier interface (touch screen) and it holds more wallets. I imagine it would live 3+ years.

Volume picking up?
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:09:05
And if you are pulling off Coinbase, transfer it to gdax first, then drop it to your wallet. Transaction fees to wallet from gdax are zero.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:00:45
Yeah. Just an old schooler dropping some old school analysis. Seems legit. Question is... you bullish, OP?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:15:02

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:52:47
And stop crying.

Fuck it. Just let bitcoin plow them over.

If this is a bubble, then these are the death throes of the entrenched elite kind of bubbles that make them more and more nervous. The herd that ol’ Novo keeps talking about is the global herd of people ready to exit the largest ponzi scheme ever built - bankers.

I’ve seen 8k evaporate with a calm and easy demeanor. Still up 4k. The volatility is beautiful. Locked out from entering the current cascade because I am out of dry fiat and digital flip currency for another day or so.

@_date: 2017-11-26 19:36:32
There isn’t.

Lee and Novo are always playing catch-up on my price predictions. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:39:20
Yeah. It’s pretty straight forward. Buy some bitcoin. Order a wallet. YouTube some videos on how it works then proceed carefully when you make the transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:05:08
It needs to eat all the money before it becomes the money. Let bitcoin eat.

If you can afford it, then just buy a nano s for the time being. If  not, then I “safely” left my stuff on Coinbase for about 2.5 months before i pulled the trigger on an emergency nano s (significant delays in blue) as I wanted to beat the forks.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:28:49
Well they will. Let’s say this. I got buy happy one day... bought a lot of dips. Apparently everything went through until one day the bank apparently reversed 300 worth of purchases. I had a lot of successful purchases in before and after the purchases that led to my current mess. 
I figured all was well - no pay, no coin, no problem.  Then one day my account was locked (still is locked)...
I’ve been trying to pay them for 4 weeks now.  apparently Coinbase “gave” me the coin (which they didn’t), but that is their claim.  I don’t even care that they are wrong I just wanted to pay them money and have my account unfrozen so I could move my assets. The messed up part is... their system is all messed up and it will not let me pay with bank account, credit card, nor pay with digital currency. How can I pay them if their system doesn’t let me. 
I even went so far as to buy extra, extra pure grade bitcoin from bitstamp to shoot to Coinbase wallet, only to have the damn settlement payment using bitcoin still not work.  LOL. They have my account so messed up and I hear from them via email once per week, saying the same message “specialists” are looking into the matter. How dumb. 
That said,  it’s the only “problem” I’ve had with them. But when I’m trying to pay them money that  I don’t owe them and none of the options they offer for settlement works, how can I pay them? This is week 4 lol. Customer service is complete junk.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:27:13
Profit taking man. Writing has been on the wall for a couple of days.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:44:54
Sign up for both. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:44:12
It ain’t. It’s not. Bitcoin is top shelf.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:06:38
Not my decision. I’d have them in tonight, if I could. I’ve spent four months solidifying my position. I’m out of wedge.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:59:11
Ask a Syrian about the ease of a trip to buy “bread” under threat of sniper fire. A lot of network attacks and general assault on the btc blockchain at the moment. Coinbase sucks, but good that you picked some up anyway.

Ah... it’s a jacket.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:35:38

@_date: 2017-11-30 01:51:16
Loss of what?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:51:18
Once that is resolved move over to Coinbase. From there you will expand as you become more technical and understand the landscape better.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:49:17
Well... if I’ve learned anything about these Btrash pumpers - you can expect a major pump by mcafee to 500k in the weeks leading up to the “cut off date.”
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:43:02
Second that. I survived china unscathed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:33:16
Consolidation and positions being taken. 10k wall and any shorts all the way up to 11.5k are going to get pulverized on this next move.

OP, this is Bitcoin. Act accordingly.

No, you don’t have to buy one full coin. You can buy smalllllll pieces.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:18:26
Well if that’s what it is I’m waiting with some micro-whale cash to grab it. Otherwise I’ll just chase this monster all the way to 20k before I’m priced out.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:53:21
Yes. Limit is 21 million BTC.
Probably 21 million, but if they can fork their coin into existence and be a central power, then they can do whatever they like with future limits. 
Their is a certain under the radar, immaculate conception that is part of the identity of bitcoin. All other forks or alts live under the miracle that was and is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:02:22
Excellent. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:54:00
This is not the inflection point. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:49:44
Link? Sorry, I’m still seeing blurry with BTC’s latest price action.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:03:11
you are saying they will sell, then bitcoin will skyrocket and price them out?
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:50:31
Why? It’s cancelled. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:34:00
Holy shit. I’ve been waiting for just over 2 months.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:26:03
It’s very early. Bitcoin is only beginning to learn how to stand up. It’s not even walking, yet.

@_date: 2017-11-03 02:08:00
Yes, but probably after a few more forks occur the consumer market will value the nonsense (emerging forked coins) less and less, and in general the method of getting around an ICO will probably cease, and this force the forkers to come up with a coin that has an actual purpose (usage case), instead of trying to hijack and/or ride the bitcoin coattails.

Price is very important. Price reflects perceived value. Currencies compete. BTC needs to go way higher to dominate all currencies. That is the path to becoming the currency. Becoming a store of value along the way is fine. But the price necessarily has to go way up to win.

That’s fine... but they will lock down the account and he won’t be able to buy/sell/or move the bitcoin. My advice is to move it and allow their settlement process to drag on for a few weeks, because it will. Otherwise he will be waiting weeks to get the payment squared away and his account will be paralyzed the entire time.

Ah ok. You purchase bitcoin. It’s sits on the exchange. They control your private keys, not you. Let alone possible hacks and some sort of who knows what happens. If you buy a cold wallet (Ledger nano s or blue, or trezor), then you can take control of your own private keys by sending it to your cold wallet. Once that is done DO NOT LOSE YOUR SEED. 
Also: send your coins to gdax before you send it to your wallet. Coinbase to gdax is free. Gdax to wallet is free. 
Gdax is the exchange that Coinbase owns. If you have an account at Coinbase you have an account at gdax.

I don’t think it’s stupid as hell. I think it’s a hedge. This isn’t just a game for those boys and girls that have a play stack of money for a cute little venture - this is a serious game. This is serious business and serious speculation with a vast portion of enjoyable volatility. Speculate to accumulate. If bitcoin does what it is supposed to do, then you will win in the long run. If it doesn’t, then hunker down and prepare to accept being liquidated. I’m on the side of bitcoin doing what it’s supposed to do. Strongly.

It’s in a tricky place at the moment. It could go back down to these prices and maybe 500-700 lower, if it hits 10k by end of year (which it more or less will). If you think btc has a lot of growth left in it (which I think that it does), then it’s early and cheap still.

Coinbase has vaults. Takes 2 days to get them out of vault, thus giving you a chance to get ahead of something sketchy if you are alert and see anything funny happening. Best to put them in a cold wallet (trezor/Ledger) - you own your private keys that way.

Ok.m, i was thinking that. I was however wondering how anyone in that position could seriously make such a statement unless they wanted another major dip so they could scoop up some more. BTC needs to skyrocket... the wall of cash needs to pay. fair price for these coins - when they get in any price under 15k sinful.

I read a statement very similar to this scenario, in an XYZ chat box, as the BCH pump was reaching max height. Stated that her/his grandma had just put it all on BCH and it better work. Might be real. 
OP... what was the XYZ chat box and I can validate/verify this is at least consistent with what I saw ~48 hours ago.

"Bitcoin's price has been slowly climbing higher after a massive sell-off in early February, which was triggered by fears over tighter regulation, rumors of price manipulation in the market, and a hack on cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck that saw over $500 million stolen."
The only thing that I believe in the opening paragraph is the "massive sell-off" portion, supported by data. The "reasons" listed for "triggering" the sell-off are goofy.

I don’t know when you call that with a number as much as you observe it happening. But starting from 1300 would make it more difficult so what was said is that it’s important to stay above 7000 to 12000... to let phase 2 wave catch up etc
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:02:41
You’re the one supporting and parading bcash supporters on here. Not everything you post on the internet is going to be “cool.” I assume you have learned your lesson. It’s ok to fall flat on the big stage when I’m around. Shake it off. You’ll be ok. Go buy the dip - the BTC dip.

they run the overstock backend and apparently let you pay with bcash and refunded you with btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:21:10
And to think... that piece of shit Conbase allowed me to sell off $10 of forked bcash for $127 (bcash valued @ $25k) on my way out the door. Conbase is a joke.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:57:30
Yup. Typical “uneducated”people will believe anything, so institutions market the separation of BTC and blockchain to seize the market segment with an appetite for “blockchain” while trying to kneecap the continually resurgent BTC.

It was a bit of a “flowery” statement...
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:40:25
It means I owned very little BTC at the time of BCASH fork. When they gave me my BCASH a few weeks ago, Conbase and I had been in a 17 week back and forth of them saying I owed them money (I could not pay them because my account was not allowing me to make payments with credit card, bank account, nor giving them crypto). Somehow, one go my attempts to pay/send them the $10 of bcash from my account to pay down my "debt," it was accepted, for an amount of $127 (or a 25k valued BCASH). Long story short... they screwed up and I am OK with that. Locking me out for 17 weeks and handling me $127 on my way out... Account closed afterward. They are a complete mess.

@_date: 2017-10-21 21:32:49
Closer to 20k. Why? each btc being worth 8k, forked b2x (a decent fraction of those will be sold at ~1000 per), then dumped back into btc. Plus the standard hype and rise of btc. No to mention any quick gains on alts from low pricing now then jumps after fork, then profit taking and dumps into btc.

It’s either up (inverse head and shoulders - on the shoulder currently), or down (head and shoulders - on that shoulder currently as well). It can’t be both. One will win.

It needs to stay above the 5k floor or it could free fall to 3500 (but I don’t think it would stay there very long) and he gets his wish.  We need 7k-7.5k to set up that 5k floor.

Below 4K is pretty steep. If it goes to 7-8k, then I think there is major support at 5.5k. But it has to get to 7.5-8k first I suppose... but it has moved its way up to 5.5k and held rather well and the long term whales helped with that when they ate that guys short the other day, no? I could see 5.5k but I’d be rather surprised if it went mush further below 5.5k, especially when launching from 6k-7.5 isn’t that big of a leap being two weeks away from B2x

So you don’t want to take the bet?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:04:08
I see. You need to buy (typically) off of an exchange (many experts here will surely offer more precise info on the multiple existing exchanges, as well as other options to purchase bitcoin). Typically one uses credit cards or links the exchange to their bank account, to initiate the purchases. Exchange sign up and verification can take a day, or two, or three, etc. - depends on exchange. Once that’s all done you buy with card or bank account funds. Once the bitcoin is in your exchange “wallet” you can (and should) move it (bitcoin) off of the exchange for safe keeping, etc. Moving it (bitcoin) off of the exchange gives you control over your coin. You don’t have to move bitcoin off of an exchange, but you should (especially with these upcoming forks), because it most importantly gives you possession of your private keys (or coins to keep it simple).

I wonder how this might actually play out... I mean certainly buying now will see a lot of profit taking after a high pre-fork run-up. but ,if it were me I’d just stay on my btc stack, split and sell B2x.  Maybe that mindset would prevail and thus lessen any massive btc sell off? Lol. Perhaps B2x inadvertently gifts btc a new support line post-fork.����

Didn’t it already “correct” at 5000?  Why would it need another correction? My thought on “corrections” is simple... the mob mentality of profit taking. I don’t see it as a “correction,” but instead fear of a correction and thus it becomes self fulfilling prophecy. Just like Sachs tried to hype up the fall to create the fall so they could make sure to scoop up on the dip. That mentality will I assume rematerialized at 7-8k, with shorting and resistance on the way up.

Come to think of it, my first bitcoin transaction sent was for about 2.5k and it wasn’t even mine. Lol. I learned how to send by sending 500 to 2500 dollar chunks of my friends btc around - probably about 15-20 times.

You should be thanking them. They are bringing down the price. You have a chance to become more whale-like as they lower the price for you to acquire more BTC. They are shaking out the weak hands. Strong hands know what to do. Buy BTC at the iron price and value your wealth in BTC.

My buddy had Coinbase. So I signed up there to keep the btc pumps for poker from me to him “easy.” I learned On this reddit page that not having private keys was a VERY bad thing. Ordered a ledger blue last day of August but I still don’t have it (so I emergency ordered a nano s) that got here 5 days ago - my coin sat on the exchange since August (and in their “vault” for about two weeks - I only discovered the vault  the beginning of October).
My recommendation. Buy bitcoin, then express order a nano s. But don’t wait to buy btc until you understand it all or you will be waiting weeks. Bitcoin tastes better if you experience the baptism by fire.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:14:37

@_date: 2017-10-29 01:24:30
mid-november. if you purchase and receive,m make sure to get your btc off the exchange and into a wallet before the fork. you want to control your coin. don't be nervous. ask questions within the thread so others can help man. i learned a lot here in a couple of months... in fact, holding a phd in physics, i only learned HERE that i was actually going to take a trip to the moon by hodling some btc until mass adoption arrives... courtesy or the btc rocket. haha.

i suggest you close, kenny.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:51:55
Yeah. I have a blue on the way (been waiting for months), but had to get an emergency nano s for the interim. Between those two I’d have enough space for the 5 types of coins I have but would rather have had it on one device. I guess we will see.
Also, these forks are going to create 2 additional coins so I’d need the space in the short term until I can dump the B2x.

No idea. It’s the costs is buying and selling. I don’t bother inquiring any further. They charge what they charge and it’s up to me/you to buy/sell it. So I absorb it as is.

I heard of bitcoin in 2010. Thought “why do I need that, I’ve got cards and stuff.” Fast forward to 2016, began channeling bitcoin towards poker accounts for my buddy. Thought... interesting, why does it have value, the hell is this? Read the white paper - got some info from it. Read it again a few months later, got a little bit more from it. Thought about dropping 3k on it January 2017 (around 1000 per coin), but didn’t... a lot of bitcoin funneling and poker games later, I picked up on its jump to 3400 around August 2017 and thought to myself I’ll read the white paper again. Read it. Put some money on btc. THEN I read and watched everything I could get my eyes on and decided to put more money in. As I participated/invested I learned more and more. I knew nothing in the beginning and probably still do not know much - but you can learn about the technicals as you go. I’m still reading and learning. If you want bitcoin, then buy bitcoin, and then continue to read. You learn as you go but can get a lot info from here - I’ve been on bitcoin since August 3, 2017, and I’ve been on reddit (5-6weeks?). I went approximately 4 weeks solo before I came to reddit. You can learn a lot here. 
Buy btc, and then study while btc works for you.

So silly. The latest rave is for people to be draw lines and making projections and it is lower than dumb. Perhaps you are a pro, as I’ve yet to analyze your lines, and I probably won’t, so maybe you will be correct - I’m just speaking generally about the massive amount of lines being drawn by anyone and everyone these days. 
By the way... I have this tiny nuclear reactor That i built in the back room complete with a neat little window to see inside - the rods are sort of glowing... is that normal? My phd in physics says that I’m going to save a ton on my electricity bill, with a marginal increase in the water bill this next year... anything to save fiat for buying btc.

If you are asking that question, then the answer is “a long time.”  Do yourself a favor and just “hodl” until you’ve studied the bitcoin landscape, and studied proper trading analysis (which is a long time). Otherwise, you will get lucky sometimes, but most often you will be eaten alive by those whom practice the craft.

Unfortunately the no will probably cause a $200 drop, even though it shouldn’t cause that. But amazon is what this mini-surge is all about anyway, I’m guessing.

Move it to gdax then send to wallet. that method is free.

What a joke:
"In addition, we think that these currencies have major shortcomings. **Is there room for a digital currency, maybe sponsored by one of the major central banks like the Federal Reserve? Yes.** Could it be incredibly useful? Could it reduce transaction costs? Yes. But not these ones."

Just part of the process... give them want they want/need and then buy what you want.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:43:21
I’ll hold the gold as I’d like to see them survive. They are not trying to harm bitcoin. B2x and Btrash are shit, though.
Btrash has a fake satoshi and fake bitcoin.

Why not just use one cold wallet and two sheets with the seed?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:31:29
Yeah toss some more fiat my way... I’m all out of powder down here.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:50:08
i do not know much about this. but from what i understand of it all... it isn't the hard dislike of bigger blocks, per say - its the way in which bigger sized blocks are implemented with respect to scaling and the rush to do so. bitcoin intends to expand the blocks in a more controlled and refined way?

Good. They are hopefully able to give the bcash and B2x tokens a few extra kicks to the teeth.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:56:03
Solid post and article.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:54:49
yes. btc will be forked and a coin called b2x will be created. if you have btc you will also have b2x... a lot of info. can be found on this.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:49:14
They just want their cut. Business.
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:47:47
never say never... but i tend to agree with 3000's being a thing of the past, unless a disaster ensues. i could envision a scenario where the 4000's reappear, but hopefully not. 5000's are still very possible and somewhat likely on the horizon, but who knows. hopefully btc can get to the 7.5k-8k on the run up to b2x, so that the 5000's become the new support line. time will tell. and technically we are still in the mid to late innovator stage... next up... adoption phase. 
in my opinion the btc rocket fuel tanks are about 50-75% fueled up. man its going to get juicy when the tanks are full and the engines start warming up as it moves towards and into the adoption stage. holy shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:46:03
Ok that’s what I thought. I’m down for the cause. Future btc node on the short to-do list.

As far as I know you sell to your bank account. dashboard -&gt; sell.

i just need to know how to safely and quickly split/shed this b2x as soon as possible so i can dump it right out of the gates. any updated news on how fast this is safely possible, using ledger wallets?

exactly. heard of it in 2009... damned if i didn't take interest until recently.
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:45:21
No matter. I’m in for the long haul. If it goes to 3k I’ll just scoop up some more bitcoin at a reduced rate. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:59:07
I get that but hand slapping seems a little unnecessary. Anyway. These problems are not my problems. I’ll sit on the sideline. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:30:44
What I want to know is if ledger is only able to hold 4 coins at a time, how do I hold another if the btc is split makes it a total of 5.

Damn man... my estimates are 1) pure gut and bull at about 65k-85k. 2) My log chart and trend extensions land near 165k-175k. People keep calling me crazy. I’m if correct, then I’ll be a sage. If I’m wrong, then I’ll just be crazy... but the crazy dude that has a little bit of BTC.
I don’t know which to believe, 1) or 2). Should probably trust the statistical distribution.

@_date: 2017-10-18 02:00:54
Not claiming that’s it’s a “bitcoin tax.” just bothered by taxes in general. In my opinion you should be taxed for money made from being “employed/paycheck.” What I invest in on the side should be private and not taxable.

it is. do it. i don't know how much lower than 5700 it will go, or if it will see 5500 after the fork. a wallet would be solid. as you purchase more btc make sure to invest in a cold wallet (nano s or trezor). good luck
