The TX fees will likely decrease in terms of BTC overtime as the price of BTC increases. Over time as more people start to use bitcoin the TX fees per block will increase, making the block subsidies less important to miners.

The only option is to build another pool with good service and 0 fee, and rely on community donations for operation cost.

Now with the news of negative interest rate, there is absolutely no point in europeans saving their money in savings banks...
it would be cool if they all flock to bitcoin..
But however it is interesting to think the government does not even want the money to stay in the banks but run and stimulate the economy, how are they gonna view bitcoin..

Bitcoin search interest rises around the same time a GoT season starts. (Except season 2)
Coincidence? I think not.

Very good. Every human is fundamentally anti war, do what you can do abolish this war state which exists to provide revenue to the big defense contractors, fuck them all.

GoCoin, founded by Brock Pierce, was able to obtain $500,000 USD of VC capital from their two(?) bedroom home/office above a restaurant in Singapore, with 95% of its customer base residing in the US. Surely, BitPay is worth six times that.

"Don't spend it all at once" that is what I'm saying to myself each time I get my payments

btw, it's completely pointless to rally against GHash.io, since it charges 0 fee and provides good service, eventually all miners will flock to it, as any miner that does not use GHash.io is essentially losing money and will lose the mining competition.

Well - it would not be too much trouble just branching out and starting their own organization if they don't like what the 'HQ' is doing.
I briefly glimpsed at the stuff the Bankers in Canada has to say about bitcoin. It's deplorable to see how much lies there are that goes around, but I guess that's the character of a banker. Deny everything until dead.

Taxing bank deposits?  Ouch. Things getting worse in the fiat world.  Will his be good for Bitcoin?  Will it be another Cyprus event?

Hahaha if somebody decide to pay me bitcoins I will not mind and ask for magic beans ;)

If BTC rate drops to the ground, the 2d winner may get more than the first!
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:29:13
of course no. I will not be suprised if Banksy doesn't know anything about bitcoin

If there is no proof for the bitstamp story let's stop thinking about it.

Only Satoshi Nakamoto has the power to bring back the $10 bitcoin, and even (s)he/they could only make it happen for a few hours at best. Word would spread extremely quickly, a massive buying frenzy would follow.
