Banks can identify Bitcoin as their enemy. They can try to use a blockchain to settle their stuff, too, but in my opinion they will never come to an agreement who should have control over their settlement network, as nobody wants to give away power.

Lightning network is able to handle millisatoshi
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:20:40
I don't think this will happen. It's a potential way to make the lightning node go out of money, if there's not sort of authentification of the person who would like to have a channel opened.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:40:30
Right, that would be a kind of an attack vector.  Imagine the node having to pay a lot of channel opening transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:15:50
Is there a way to observe channel updates (perhaps parsing debug logs)? Maybe one can correlate with the number of transactions made. That would be cool to see.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:49:06
My feeling also says it's not him.
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:53:32
I guess they will not be able to connect back, as he is using c-lightning and they don't support multiple channels between two nodes yet.
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:19:43
I support it, let's do it with a UASF!
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:53:10
This year everything's different.
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:19:12
Cool, it is more libertarian than LN-penalty. I like it, hopefully the softfork can happen this year.
@_date: 2018-05-01 08:21:46
Ok, that was maybe a litte wrongly expressed, sorry. I meant, that there is no self-punishment, if your node broadcasts an old state by accident. I think cheating doesn't happen as often as you think. There is an asymmetry in cheatery. As a user, who bought something from a merchant, you're interested in broadcasting an old state, however the merchant's LN node is online anyhow most of the time and can take countermeasures. As a merchant you're mostly not interested in broadcasting an old state. So it's all about the decision whether the ease of implementation and of creating watchtowers is worth the downsides. I think it can be a nice alternative, but one has to see.

Segwit test node up and running...
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:34:48
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:38:14
Ah yes, thanks, I was actually including it in the original post, but then somehow deleted the URL.
@_date: 2016-03-13 05:05:35
I think, it's bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-01-19 09:15:56
Right, they are and I appreciate what they are doing, but they should do everything to keep bitcoin as stable as possible and unite the communities for sake of their own and bitcoins will. As OP was saying, they could buy some time in order to implement all their great features. We should be aware that we have the network effect advantage and we shouldn't play with it. There are other competitors with much more PR who will try to outpace us.
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:37:37
Despite "normal" fee setting in mycelium, I didn't have to wait long for confirmation.
Wallet programmers, please all implement fee estimation. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:21:49
Yes, I also thought that.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:21:03
I just wanted to write a similar comment. I agree with you, the potential of core developers should stay, but they should also serve the community. In my opinion a 2mb increase should be perfectly doable, with breaks for the maximum transaction size in place (maybe 1mb, so everything would be effectively the same for the argument of DOS).
We need this in order to be able to GROW!
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:38:03
Fist of all I think we will see some exchanges collapsing. As people withdraw, we will see some going out of bitcoins. There certainly are some other cryptsies around.
I think a reasonable way to go through the hard fork is to stop all trading activity, grab some popcorn and see who's winning the fight :). Anyhow, I think a consensus mechanism will be used, so it should be more or less clear who's going to win.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:39:47
I think they are too late to the game. I suppose they are would also fabricate in China, but due to the middlemen it becomes less profitable. The mining centralization won't be resolved in the next years, because China is also the leader in investments in renewable energy.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:51:35
Nobody cares about price, there are much more important things right now.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:25:25
Everybody in this world is replaceable!
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:17:55
Just take sha256+scrypt and we have quite some security (and low antpool hashrate ;) ): 
Of course, that wouldn't solve the problem. We must switch to some hashing algorithm, for which several countries in the world can produce efficient hardware.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:40:11
Do it. We have to move on.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:40:47
Yes, I agree! A good thing. We are still in the experimental phase.
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:58:29
I never sold :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:30:00
There is still plenty of time, we upgraded 25% of nodes to 0.14 within 20 days. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 18:04:23
I was also worried about whether it will be activated any time soon. I expect, that with the recent price increase we have a bunch of new users incoming. This will lead to more fee pressure and blocks start to be full 100 %. Over time miners will also want to collect the rest of transaction fees. As a hard fork is the most unlikely scenario (look at the node distribution), the best option to increase throughput is to activate segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:41:23
Very good! I'm looking forward to these enhancements. Mining pools should work hard to change their setup for support of segwit. It shows you how well run the slush pool is for example, having their codebase under control.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:42:00
I think that is THE big problem.
@_date: 2017-01-21 08:31:35
I also support it.
@_date: 2016-11-25 07:41:01
Yes, we need it
@_date: 2016-11-03 08:35:35
You need to look here: 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:55:00
The spamming just started again, I think.
@_date: 2016-12-26 10:06:19
It looks like a trap :)
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:16:47
I want segwit. If you like to have segwit, please express yourself, don't remain quiet!
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:51:05
We need segwit!
@_date: 2016-11-30 15:12:59
One could check if there are correlations with the bitcoin prize :)
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:30:41
Miners have too much power. Don't give them more.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:29:58
It is going too slow! Miners, upgrade your software!
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:51:54
Very good!
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:05:41
Watchtowers and atomic multipath payments. Maybe also channel splicing.
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:50:46
Lightning intrgration for the icecast server
@_date: 2018-06-17 15:52:36
The icecast server is very popular in audiostreaming service and it's open source. A lightning pluging could offer streaming with subscribed LN payments.
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:28:45
This is great, please other miners, join!
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:02:12
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:45:49
Bitcoin is not ready for primetime. Cryptocurrencies in today's state won't be able to fix the problem. Something more has to be done (lightning network). This will take some time.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:54:59
Great software written in my favorite language.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:55:04
Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) is not ready for primetime. The public shouldn't use it by now. We need to develop it further.
@_date: 2016-02-20 12:31:52
If so prepare for all time high ;)
@_date: 2016-02-29 10:47:40
And everything still works...
@_date: 2016-02-20 08:42:32
That's an application for the lightning network, you can open a payment channel between two parties and then do microtransactions.
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:23:26
I like this work very much and would like to see it applied to bitcoin. However, I heard that due to the discrete log assumption the algorithm is not quantum proof. In Benedikt Bünz presentation, I think, he talked about this could enable silent inflation. Can somebody clarify this?
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:05:43
At the moment, the network (mainnet) runs at low capacity. Therefore if you have open several (~4) channels to ensure a good connectedness. It is not so easy to test mainnet, since there are not many places where you can spend.
On testnet I have more problems, as it seems people are more careless about their nodes and channels. I think it still needs time for the devs to edge out bugs. With increasing confidence in the code, capacity will increase and everything runs more smoothly. Also with atomic multi-path payments I expect improvement.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:43:15
Once core integrates it in the wallet, things probably go much faster.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:13:34
I hope Electrum 3.0 will be released soon.
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:41:30
So through the formal verification, one can estimate the computational cost of a smart contract. Somehow the smart contract has to pay for this like in ethereum where gas is used. How would one translate the cost into fees?
@_date: 2016-10-28 07:18:35
Thank you, upgraded my node!
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:45:58
Yes, that's clear, but still it serves as kind of an upper bound. Btw, I was asuming half of the block being spam ;)
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:05:08
If you would assume an attack and I ask you for your estimate, what is it? What do you think about that number?
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:14:33
I still prefer my Intel NUC node.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:49:04
That might be true. However it lays the foundation to solve the problems. And it gives new hope!
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:52:11
Nice, thank you Thomas!
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:42:41
I would support this, if they implement it with  just to get over the drama.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:11:24
So is this now possible due to tx malleability fix?
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:15:55

Provide a command line flag, which enables bip148/bip149, turned off by default.
This way devs can stay neutral.
@_date: 2016-10-08 09:31:37
Thank you :)
I'm running an Intel NUC ( It has low energy consumption and is relatively quiet. I bought it with a 500 GB hard drive and 4 GB of RAM.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:23:15
Keep on going!
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:58:13
We need a configurable uasf flag for the core client which is turned off by default.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:49:37
Is your pull request finished or do you need to implement still minor things?
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:27:19
That's what we need, innovation!
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:57:56

@_date: 2017-05-08 19:33:22
Please consider an optional command line flag for the uasf feature deactivated by default, that users can activate. It is more likely your pull request will be accepted, if developers can stay neutral.
@_date: 2017-07-03 19:05:10
I wrote to Poloniex, btc-e, and Kraken. Please consider to write to exchanges you use.
