I've known about Bitcoin since you had to CPU mine it in the core client. Never, never bought. Fucking hurts, man.

Current crypto debate in a nutshell...

This is not how anything works...

Yeah, they support different forks. Both segwit and BU are proposed forks of Bitcoin. As for what their exact proposals are, as well as their arguments — just don't bother, let the big boys fight it out.

Everyone seems to miss the following drop in this sea of bullshit:




This isn't nearly how mining economy works.
First, the implication that the price is in any way at all affected by mining expenses is totally false. It's completely the other way around. The expenses are still growing in the falling market because the price to mine 1 BTC hasn't nearly reached the price of 1 BTC yet, there just haven't been enough factories available to make these ASICs. The point of equilibrium will come, though I can't speculate on how soon it will be.
Second, no miner in their right mind would mine at a loss to hodl in hope of future returns — might as well just turn off the equipment and buy more Bitcoin instead of unprofitably trading electricity for it. When mining becomes unprofitable for some, they'll just stop mining and leave it for everyone else to do, slightly lowering the difficulty.

That would most likely require a hard fork, so no to that. Best thing we'll get in this regard may be a "Bitcoin Cash 2: Divisible Bogaloo" fork that will be widely hated on this sub.

Dollar cost averaging is, more often than not, a bookkeeping trick used to hide losses (especially from oneself).
In your example, if you've started with the $30k you wanted to invest, you win nothing by employing the strategy: sure, you save money if the market goes down in the process, but you'd save more if you bought everything at the end. Moreover, if the market goes up, you either lose money compared to the base case of just buying "for the whole cotlette", or you get underexposed by only leaving the amount invested at $10k.
You aren't even reducing any risk here: you're just effectively buying for some price other than the "starting" price, and you absolutely don't know which in advance (if you somehow knew, you'd be able to time the market instead).
Now, in the other case, which is the most common when people apply "dollar cost averaging" to their personal crypto investments, you don't start out with a plan to invest $30k. You do the $10k trade, and only then, when everything starts to go to shit, you come up with another $10k to be able to show yourself a more pleasing average and calm your nerves. I mean, both the first and the second investment may still turn out to be good, but by considering them as they are somehow a single trade with the average cost, you win nothing other than taking a placebo drug.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:29:59
Yup. We just have to hope we aren't at the all time peak of stupidity, so there's still room to grow.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:26:06
No. But it means that someone will buy *this* stock from you at new high price, eventually the company will fail (statistical truth), and they'll be left holding the now worthless bags. What you've gained, someone's lost. Zero sum.
The catch is that some companies may not fail for centuries, so the loss is long deferred.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:27:39


Just tell everyone to HODL while the wave of new investors hopefully accumulates.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:45:45
Nothing gives out a blind believer like referring one's opponent to "some reading". Get your arguments straight, man! Even a simple "fuck you" would look better.

You may call crypto "tech" all you want, but in this sentence it's clearly out of place.
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:36:37


We're living in the age where something completely digital can very well be "an actual thing". The older generation may never get why these CS:GO hats cost so much, but as a matter of fact they do and there's no debate about it among the people who buy and sell them.


So does Bitcoin, and oh boy it does. And I'm not talking about some "innovative blockchain tech economy" bullshit some bagholder has read in a whitepaper.
Just go and try to buy drugs as an average Joe, without *knowing people*. I guarantee that you will have to buy Bitcoin in the process. But that's illegal? Exactly — only because it is illegal in so many jurisdictions, there are billions of dollars of supply and demand which wouldn't meet without this medium. And yeah, there are markets that use Litecoin or Monero, just like you can make jewellery out of platinum or palladium.

It is about as practical as gold, and it has *some* intrinsic value — the darknet markets still largely operate on it, even after the December fee spike.

I swear some of these comments are produced by a markov chain trained on buzzword soup.

So what you're saying is that I should acquire 10% of some crypto with $8000 MC and wait 40 years for it to somehow become the next Apple?
Moreover, 72 500 000x in 42 years adds up to just 57% yearly returns. Huge ones admittedly, but still not what most crypto investors come for.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:21:04
You are talking about economy as a whole — like, with production and consumption.
Market in itself (e.g. a crypto exchange) is a zero-sum game, though. For every dollar won by someone, there's 1.002 dollars lost by someone else (gotta account for the fees!)
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:10:45


So it will go all the way down, then right back up, then down again is what you're saying?

Totally wrong.
I can't be sure about this particular ransomware, but all the successful cryptolocker partnerkas in the past actually decrypted your data if you paid up, however cynical that may sound or be. Otherwise the word would be out quickly, victims would stop paying and the particular partnerka would lose popularity fast.
What many people don't realize is that it's not some monolithic "group of hackers" that create and distribute the malware, instead it's a partnerka — an agreement between people who write malware and maintain its infrastructure and people who distribute the stuff using spam, browser exploit packs and what not, for a significant (50—80%) fraction of the profts. It's a moderately big industry that thousands of people make a living off of.
How the verification is done in this particular case, I can't be so sure, but in the general case it's mostly different addresses for different instances that are downloaded upon encryption or something along those lines.

Wait, Ant USA4? You mean, someone mines in the US with those electricity prices?
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:34:15
That seems to be quite hard for a regular victim to perform. You have to be, let's say, not too computer savvy to get infected in the first place. I imagine most places where you can buy and send bitcoin easily won't even let you know any private key to sign shit.
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:32:02
Why can't you broadcast a new transaction with the same inputs and outputs, but with a higher fee? Is this an issue of you wallet application?

I don't understand. What "leaked top-secret NSA tools" does this ransomware allegedly use? AES encryption? E-mail spam bots? Browser exploit packs? Never would've thought that Russian hackers would need any NSA bullshit to get things done.

You could also do the 500$ thing with your own company's stock and beat Apple. Well, the regulators wouldn't let you, but in principle you could. What's your point with this example?

It's not like dial-up in this regard. Internet speeds in the dial-up era were held back by lack of expensive infrastructure, slow computer clock rates and the need for relevant R&amp;D in the field of high-frequency waves, fiber-optics and shit. With Bitcoin, it's completely different.
Let me break it to you: to get more speed, you need to accept some more centralisation. When you go from 3–7 tx/s to 1,000,000s tx/s, you also go from peer-to-peer internet money to PayPal, from BitTorrent to YouTube, from Napster to Spotify. There's no progress to be made, just the trade-off.
See, Satoshi wasn't stupid when he developed Bitcoin. He was an experienced C++ programmer in the field of cryptography, so it's pretty well optimised. You can't have less bits per transaction, otherwise the system wouldn't be cryptographically secure, and, to put things simple, you can't really have more bits per second, otherwise peers would start to fall behind.
There's no real significant improvement ahead, especially with Moore's law betraying us like that. Bitcoin is about what we'll ever have when it comes to decentralised money. I'm not trying to say that it's bad or useless — quite the contrary, which seems to contradict your opinion when you get all into the future talk.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:57:10
You can also argue it's pretty meaningless for stock markets, but you don't hear people protest about it every time the metric is used.

Might as well hide your wallet.dat and default on this shit while you're at it

Yeah, the backup addresses version looks good. If the servers are shut down in the end, the attackers can "scam out" and still suck up some buck.

Not only that, some transactions in the block that came may have spent the inputs for some other transactions, making them now invalid
