What about taking out a $ amount that's similar to your initial investment plus some profit. 
So if you put $10,000 in and now have 100,000 maybe take out 20K to cover making some profit and taxes?
That way you could lose it all and it wouldn't be a catastrophe and if it goes to moon you're in the game. 
Losing money hurts more than making it feels good IMHO.
Oh and on taxes that's something I'm going to need to pay an accountant to figure out because I have no idea on that one besides it's gotta be done.

You could keep 1/5th of the code in 20 bank vaults so 5 banks with the same set of code would need to be destroyed...

This for so many reasons. 
Want relatives asking for "loans". I quote because they're not asking to intend on paying you back.
Or do you want to be kidnapped. Telling someone you have 50 bitcoins or whatever is begging to get jacked by your cousins' meth head boyfriend.

“Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.”
Is this true???

The main motivation for me is that once people get how great BTC is it'll really come of age. 
Like how email was obvious because it was fast, stamp free, searchable...
Or how internet was better than the dewey decimal system and then some.
They see BTC and are confused by the news of drugs and hacking and will feel more comfortable having basically their money as they trust it and use it on Amazon. 
Henry Ford said "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”
Venmo might be their faster horse. Google, Apple, and others are making faster horses right now.  I need some silver bullets. Maybe I need to personally drill in myself harder and come up with some compelling communication. 
I need to make all the uncles, aunts, neighbors, and old school movers in finance understand this thing point by point.

At this point you'd have to be pretty financially secure to hold BTC.
I'm sure his vendors generally don't take BTC and restaurants have a never ending stream of bills to pay. 
Great news though.

It's not gold vs bitcoin. 
Edit: By that I mean they're not tied together.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:57:36
Agreed. As a hobby level interest sure, but if you have a low profit margin business as some restaurants are you'd need to have vendors accepting. 
I'm a believer in BTC so have some and hope to spend not just hold. But my personal business I'd be insolvent at this point if I accepted and didn't convert due to the small population in this payment medium.

Thanks [u/leaveduck]( Any opinion on Coinbase for the same services? I just ask because their merchant page looks pretty solid. I'm kind of split right now between Coinbase and Bitpay. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:55:14
If someone asks for opinions and perspectives that's a good thing. I care about being informed and some people on this sub know a lot more than I do about BTC's advantages.
So if you can't answer the question....
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:50:32
We hope to sell 20-50 units a month, but are pre-market right now. Waiting on shipment from China after a year and 1/2 of writing and design. 
I've heard good things about bitpay. Need to drill in and see what's easy but not too costly.  I'm a director/editor by trade, so core competencies are not in line with doing anything too tricky with the site. Am a bitcoin lover though so to heck with my terrified accountant, I'm taking BTC come hell or high water or some website headaches.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:16:22
Yea you're right. This is partially because of the maturity of the credit card and $ economy. BTC being so young it's a little raw for the 80% needed to make this evolution happen. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:14:27
That's what I was thinking. Thinking about the perfect bar.
@_date: 2014-10-19 13:01:37
What are the best services for merchants using Bitcoin, specifically at tax season?
I’m considering including a “buy with bitcoin” button on a site for a product I made. 
([Link]( to current placement at thinkgeek.com.)
Our site will be ready in about a week hopefully, and I’m a bit worried that the tax implications are going to be prohibitively complex. 
Thinking of using coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 10:50:10
Of all the relatively main stream financial news sources, it seems like Bloomberg covers Bitcoin with the most articles and (sort of) open mind.

how is that different from venmo?
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:00:04
This is a serious question about how to react to a talking point, and not about personal politics. 
If venmo has no fees and works on your phone so you can buy stuff how is BTC going to penetrate the consumer economy?

Thanks for writing this response [elan96](  I love bitcoin but the tax/irs thing seems scary so I'd be converting this to dollars.  
Ironically I'd probably want to then turn around and use the (tiny) profits to buy bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-25 10:48:23
About to release a product and was starting to figure out the smartest way to accept BTC. Was beginning to look at bitpay to help out. Did you use a company to help set up accepting BTC or did you set it up yourself somehow? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:17:28
I like the music, but maybe it's a touch high (4db too high). 
IMHO that is. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:47:50
I know a user and he says it's easy and if there's advertising he doesn't notice. I can't for the life of me figure out how they exist without fees or obvious ads.
Again anecdotal but my friend says he uses it. 
I don't want to go through tying my bank account to it and doing a full opinion building experience of trying to use the service as that's really a 2 week process. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:42:46
Less detail than a FAQ. 
The most concise way of reacting to every misunderstanding.
I get asked questions and I nail it usually but I see some eyes glaze over as maybe I tangent. I like to start with things like Q: "What is BTC" A:"It's money designed for the internet".
Maybe I should just try writing a bunch of things and let the sub have at it. 
A nicely turned phrase really makes a connection with people.

I felt inspired by the idea of Bitcoin. A rock solid, practical, and ideal filled (for me) new way of doing business with less middle men.
When it really was feeling past the hype cycle and in it's 2014 space I thought, "Is it time to step out and call this a painful loss.", but then instead I took a step back and asked myself if I still felt inspired by Bitcoin.
My answer is why I held. I love Bitcoin to it's core. And if I still loved Bitcoin then other people would too and it'd continue to write history.

I think it's possible that your buisness is confusing to them as is Bitcoin. It's not run of the mill and we fear what we don't understand as well as only take risks (in their opinion you might be a legal risk) that pay them back richly. 
Big banks launder money for international drug dealers for sure when it's in the 100's of millions. But a mom and pop shop selling whatever might raise suspicion and might not be lining their pockets.

I appreciate your writing and believe you're right based on the repeating of this position universally on this forum.
But is this in case a MT. Gox thing happens? So if Coinbase blew up and it's not insured I'd have been a fool for having money there and not in hand? 
Is that the reasoning behind keeping your BTC in your hands?

Andreas says mobile OS are more secure than mac or microsoft. 
Is he wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:53:08
Right, but since trezor is back ordered mobile is still better than a lap top my question is about backing up mobile. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:59:02
Question from the uninformed:
Andreas clearly states that your computer is not as safe as mobile and suggests using mobile if you don't have a hardware wallet.
Would backing your phone up using your laptop then make for the same vulnerability since your phone backup is on the computer hard drive? Or is it encrypted?
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:26:03

How best to ask them why they go down more than, say Gemini?
I think they should account for a real reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:24:03
What exactly is wrong with leaving your Bitcoin on Coinbase?
I know they're slow, charge too much, and are a big company,  but isn't just like leaving money in the bank instead of holding at home in a safe?
Edit: I know on this sub I'm going to get greif, but I simply don't know what the problem is and haven't figured it out so am asking.

Right now we're focused on personal needs. Like a friends and family pitching in kind of thing.  Stuff like if you're having a bad year and really need a new fridge, or if you're headed to college and need a lap top or something.

@_date: 2017-06-01 10:53:59
I'm also impatiently awaiting a transfer to clear at Coinbase, but totally think it's just them being legitimate and being stuck dealing with the old world banking system. 
Gemini feels faster because they front the money. This is a risk they take and it is fine by me. But I still like and trust Coinbase. 
And for perspective, MTGOX was originally a Magic the Gathering trading company run by an oaf.

I'm an editor and want to share some advice.
Ask them for a list of basic questions they'll be putting forward.
Have a good friend ask you the questions so that you're ready to answer without thinking too much on camera. Don't practice too much though or you'll sound (and be) fake. You just don't want to give a partial answer or bumble. You might also learn a little about what their perspective is for the film by their questions. And if their line of questions diverges too much from their list you'll know they might have had a plan to surprise you.

I bet you're right that it'd probably take a lot of development to make it secure and fast.  
In the end we'd (probably) want to transfer the bitcoin immediately to the fundraiser while taking a tiny fee in the process similar to how we do our $ fund raising now.  PayPal makes this convenient for their partners, we'd need to build this feature.

Not cold at all. If someone needs a decent sum of money for a life emergency, a honeymoon, education, there's probably a particular number to hit.  Instead of a bottomless pit of "give me something" I personally like that there's a plan and a particular goal that I help see them reach.

Congrats on the profit. 1K is money made.
You're probably right, but I'm staying in.
It's not pride in my case or beliefs, it's that I made a contract with myself that I'd stand with this to $40K or to $0. This way I've committed the position to wild gains or to make a learning experience out of bitcoin. This self imposed rule also keeps me from emotional trading.
But seriously, making money while being part of something new is an accomplishment so kudos.

Our current service is focused on friends and family giving money to each other when need arises. We decided to let the money through even if the goal isn't met because this is a tool for people with a relationship helping. An example would be a kid needs a lap top for school and his family all pitches in. So even is they need $1,200 and they get $900 that's a really big help.
