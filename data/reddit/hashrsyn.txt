A lot more work to be done, the answer may be in that mining address. I am going deeper in past into the source of the 180k next.

The api is only showing a portion of the coins. They are now entering long chains of 50 BTC values. I was catching up for awhile mapping them but falling behind again, damn sleep.

If you go back to proof in 2011 there was the 50k account which has recently gone active. It is currently being split up into amounts ranging from 2-30 BTC then being recombined into perfect 50 BTC values.
This is the Original transaction Nov 16 2011.
It eventually goes into this transaction for imagine that 180k.
From there it is cut roughly in half many times over the last 2 days.
Here are a couple addresses I found so far.

Gox BTC is being broken down and reassembled into 50 BTC increments.

I found a link to a mining address report here.

All I know for certain was the was the one mining address, which would have been Butterfly labs SC singles, but there was other suspected ones. I never knew what the exact number of miners that Edelson turned up from Butterfly Labs. Based upon the starting date that "1PA" started mining upon Eligius it would have placed his order late 2012. Given that the only other mining hardware available at the time was a small number of Avalons, it did not leave to many choices to get in the 100s of GH/s in 2013. I do have lists of other addresses that I had only briefly checked out back then and intend to post them up in the future with emails. Before I do that I want to scrub the emails and remove phone numbers, addresses and personal data. I will then place them into a transcript with notes. Many portions of the communication I had with Edelson were via telephone also so obviously lack records for those.

This is just the beginning, in the end I foresee a compilation/transcript of emails describing how these are interconnected. Others know, giving them a chance to be first.

This data was provided to Edelson PC back in 2014. This is also the reason nothing past the initial report ever came out to avoid any issues it may have caused with the class action lawsuit. A major Bitcoin news outlet is sitting on all of the emails exchanged in regards to this information and more. I am giving them a chance to release the story but as time goes by I will just release the transcripts myself. Tick Tock

Or the following link
"BTW they were butterfly lab machines, SC singles, although I never got a total number of purchased machines."
I am placing stuff there as a matter of my own convenience, take it or leave it.

So on 19 March I get the following email from Steven Woodrow ...
Can you keep a secret?
Tibanne KK owns the IP address used to login to 1PA. Boom!
Turns out the IP was 103.6.19.2, which was formerly belonging to Tibanne HK. 
When Mark claimed to have lost it all, he was actively mining and sending fund into to the division of the 200k BTC. Every single transaction tied to that mining address is a potential lead.

Most certainly a public end to a blackmail attempt, that way I can make 1,000,000,000,000,000 ..... BTC and spend it all on skittles and derivatives based upon the skittles commodity ETFs. Also given that I have placed a real name attached to said information maybe I am blackmailing myself but in such legal matter I shall plead the 5th and create an endless feedback loop of nonsense. As for the FB, it sucks I know, but at the end of the day I can share what I wish, how I wish and with whom I wish. Oh yeah investment tip, long skittles.

Hard to say, what one may see as relevant another may not, that would be an individual decision. Some one else may just want to know a little more for the sake of knowing more and as such they will determine if it is relevant to them. 
Or another may wonder if the law firm they hired to represent them had acted 100% in their respective best interest and provided them "due diligence". Were all avenues of approach pursued in the restitution of their clients assets. Did they honor rule 1.6 of the American Bar Association.  
Maybe one will find relevance if they question the entity, MTGox / Tibanne / Mark Karpele, and their fiduciary duty (A fiduciary duty is a legal duty to act solely in another party's interests ... applies above also) to their clients. Did they (MTGox) make claims about their product/service, bitcoin exchange, which were most likely false, specifically about the security used to protect their clients assets. Or did MTGox acting as a fiduciary to it's clients, avoid conflicts of interest in regards; to it self and clients or between clients and other clients. For example say certain parties were allowed to transfer out assets while others were not allowed to, or maybe even given warning to an impending freeze in transactions. Another situation may be to execute trades (Tibanne HK) in advance of clients, aka front running, for the profit of the company or even for making up losses if one believes that story.
Luke relevance is often very subjective. For example I would say the records of a mining pool that solely handled the transactions of MTGox would be very relevant, they would give insight into what had happened 2 years ago. Further more, post withdrawal freeze may even indicate complicit parties which would be in such records. What about the transaction malleability claims, certain individuals would have been notified of failed transactions, and certain individuals would have known such claims to be BS. Just my 2 cents, but in my opinion seems pretty relevant. I will continue provide what I known to let the reader determine relevance.
