I saw someone else post about the need for a bitcoin emoji. I thought of this a few days ago and reached out to them. I’ve sponsored an emoji for my business before, so I had a contact there.
My design firm can design the emoji. Does anyone else want to help out with the rest of the application?

When you have high profile bankers spreading FUD, it's good to remember there are tech titans that the general population respects that think it's a revolutionary idea.

Look into bitpay and start from there. There may be better services, but that’s a starting point.

Batman was the ride, the video was made by six flags, so they pump their ride. 
I should edit out all their Batman footage and drop in ATH media footage juxtaposed with FUD. Lesson of the day: just because the rollercoaster goes up, down and around does not mean you want to jump off. HODL!
