Bitcoin is totally different than Ripple or Ethereum. 
Ripple is a way for banks to transact between themselves in a centralized, private blockchain.
Ethereum is a decentralized computing platform. Its like Amazon Web Services, except the state of every virtual machine can be seen on a public blockchain. 
Bitcoin allows people to be their own bank, and send and transact without a trusted middleman. It is also the first use case for blockchain technology, the same thing that underpins ripple and ethereum.

To add to this: 
The CFTC regulates futures (and thus Bitcoin futures.) The SEC regulates money managers. So if you are managing money on behalf of someone else, you need to have the appropriate Series certification from the SEC.
In terms of Bitcoin, there's no one group who regulates it in the government. FinCEN regulates exchanges and money transmitters, for example, but that's where their oversight ends.

What problem are you trying to solve here, though? The current system has worked well for the network. 


If blocks are minted too fast, one set of nodes close to the miner would switch to that block, while nodes further away might solve a block on their own and would work on that. It takes processing to fix orphans, plus pools only have 101 confirmations to account for this. 
The 10 minute times saves this, gives plenty of time for new blocks to propagate, and also makes sure the network has a safe buffer to adjust.

The difficulty is based on the average time to find a block over the last 2016 blocks. 
So if it takes 20 minutes, on average, the difficulty will drop 50%. If it takes 5 minutes, the difficulty will rise 100%. If it takes 10.25 minutes, the difficulty will go up only slightly.
The number of zeroes is based on the hexadecimal representation of the current target.

@_date: 2018-01-21 23:13:41
Difficulty is about making sure the network generates blocks in a consistent time. If the difficulty didn't adjust, we'd already have generated all the bitcoin that will ever exist. It is so that Bitcoin has time until all of the coins are minted.
Double spending are prevented both by nodes and by miners. Nodes will reject a double spend and the transaction should never make it to the mempool for  a miner to pick up. 
The time it takes to generate a block is also a safeguard to orphaned blocks. This way, the network has plenty of time to propagate the current block so miners can readjust. 
(The FIBRE system between pools also helps reduce orphans.)

It all depends on your situation.
If you have:
* Cheap power
* A way to subsidize power costs while prices are low
* A warehouse, shed, sound-proof garage, or other non-in home option
* Knowledge to setup your space and manage your miners
* Stable internet 
* Patience to buy miners direct from the makers at non-marked up prices
* Resolve and funds to add more hash power as the difficulty rises
Then yes, it can be worth it.

If your goal is to make a quick profit, then buying the coins and holding them is the best way.
If your goal is to spend a little upfront and then a lot overtime in power costs, mining is for you.
It is almost never profitable to do cloud mining - where you pay someone some amount to run the machines at the pools they choose.
However, hosted mining or hash power rental, where you control what pools you point at and you can verify the hash rate, might be better for you, depending on the price.

Alibaba is like eBay, except people are in China and Russia and you have almost no recourse to get a refund. Most of the sellers on there do not offer the price and delivery assurance. 
Only buy direct from Bitmain - they have sales all the time and you just need to follow their twitter to see when, then set your alarm clock and hope you get lucky. Demand is still outpacing supply.
FOMO is not your friend and will cause you to lose money here. Don't fall for scam sites - and this includes new companies who promise miners but don't offer any proof or independent third party reviews.
The list of companies who have shipped actual miners is very small:
* Bitmain

* eBit
* Whatsminer/Pangolinminer
* BW
* Innosilicon 
The jury is still out on Halongmint, who have one video showing the device and have not shipped any yet, even though legit people have claimed they're real.

I hate to break it to you, but you'll be mining a very small amount of Bitcoin, way lower than the payout threshold for most pools.
You can mine to any wallet, but you'll need to find a pool that will take these ancient machines. Because your contribution to a pool will be so small, most people use these older USB devices as a lottery ticket and solo mine. Your odds of hitting a block are pretty much 0, though. 
Right now these will generate around 8 satoshi a day, which is way less than the power they'll use. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:18:51


But that brings up a different problem. If it took less computational power, the network would be less secure. The less power it takes, the less it takes to run a 51% attack. Right now the immense cost of attacking the network makes it more resilient than any other coin.


Probably not. Other coins have lower block times and are able to handle orphans, but they have lower traffic than Bitcoin. Litecoin is probably the closest. 
According to this:  you have a couple of orphans a week in LTC. 
Compare that to Bitcoin where you have maybe one a month:

I think of the power usage as a driver of renewable energy. Since using sources like hydro is so much cheaper, miners are driving the adoption of lower cost energy sources.

Blockchain.info gives you the best data there. A SegWit fee is not per byte, it is per "weight" - which is where the SegWit comes from. In a SegWit transaction, different elements of the data are weighted as less. A legacy transaction is "bigger" in terms of that weight.
So your 668b TX is similar to a 228b TX because the witness data is priced at 1/4th the cost of the non-witness data. In a non-SegWit tx, all the data is 4x as expensive. 
When a miner looks at transactions to include, the majority of pools should be calling "GetBlockTemplate" from their node. This ranks the transactions by the highest total fee.
For example, if I query my node, I see a transaction with a fee of 7182597 sat and a weight of 7016 as the top one, but the second one is 600000 sat for a weight of 892.

Your calculations don't include what it takes to get more computational power, though. 
So the attacker has 50 and the network has 4000, but it's much easier now to spin up nodes to attack. With high difficulty, you need to make ASICs and have specialized hardware. With a lower difficulty, every outdated piece of hardware, every GPU, and maybe if you lower it enough, every CPU.
You've just made it 10x easier for an attacker to gather resources to attack the network. Why would you want that? I still don't see why the current difficulty mechanism is a problem for you. 
Power usage? Expense of ASIC production?

Have you heard the saying "necessity is the mother of invention"? 
Well Bitcoin miners need cheap energy, and there is a great financial incentive to get the cheapest power possible. ~~Most~~Some large miners are already using renewable power (especially hydro) to power their farms. 
When you have hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, you look for opportunities. That could lead to newer, cheaper forms of power. 
The demand, coupled with the financial incentive, could drive more innovative power and has already driven wider renewable energy adoption. 
Anyway, the whole "Oh Bitcoin uses so much power" is a red herring, since other technologies also use obscene amounts of power and people don't hold it against them.

The blockchain is a text file that says InputX sent OutputY some amount (N) of coins. Your address is OutputY.
When a fork coin copies the chain, you are the only one who has the key to OutputY, so you own that.
So let's say you have .03 BTC on the real chain. Some developer copies the chain and forks it for their Mega-super-turbo-championship-edition Bitcoin. You have .03 Mega-super-turbo-championship-edition coin on that copy of the chain, in addition to the .03 you have on real Bitcoin.

The fee is based on the transaction weight, not the amount. The weight of the transaction include things like the number of inputs you are spending. If you send FROM a SegWit input (or all SegWit inputs), your weight will be lower so your total fee will be lower.

What you described is how a multipool like Prohashing works.
This isn't quite accurate for how Nicehash works.  Your GPU is being rented by other people who are mining altcoins. Nicehash charges those renters in BTC, and they pay out a portion to you for providing the hash.

Those are mining pools. They dont, by themselves, use much power. They run pool software, stratum proxies, bitcoin nodes, and web servers. 
You can setup a pool on a raspberry pi, and I'm guessing the majority of these run in cloud environments like AWS.
The power usage comes from the ASICs that are connected to these pools, which are distributed around the world. THOSE are the farms that are using Hydro.

Doesn't the difficulty adjustment take care of that with Bcash at least? It changes every block, so if 49% of the hash rate went away, the difficulty would fall even more. The subsequent blocks would be rejected since there was less work. 
I believe that's also why altcoins use adjustment algorithms like gravity wave to change the difficulty more frequently - to prevent 51% attacks.

Bitcoin is an infant technology. Who knows if Satoshi imagined the scale at which it has grown. All technology adapts - so sidechains and SegWit are just an evolution to the basic core of the system. If they work well, there's nothing stopping them from being made part of the basic system. 
The developers are releasing at massive scale - so added tech can "bandage" while it is being tested. 
Remember that the massive power costs are there to secure the network further. Does it take a lot of power to run the network? Yes. Would I, as a miner, love to be able to get rewards with smaller investment? Of course.

The block header has a few elements that need to match in order to be valid.
One of these is called the merkle root - this is a hash of all the transactions in the block. 
A change to the first transaction, which awards the miner, would change the hash of the merkle root, which would in turn change the block hash. 
A miner needs to have a block hash with a special format - so if you change the merkle root, or just add yourself to it, the format changes and you no longer have a valid block.
Subsequent miners will perform these calculations for prior blocks - this is called a confirmation. They've confirmed that the block (and transactions) are valid - so in order to retroactively change something, you'd have to recompute all the hashes in the system and find a way to still make them valid. This is currently impossible with any known computer, even quantum computers.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:22:29
You can't open a channel without transfering coins, so all the coin spent on lightning will be mined into blocks and pay TX fees.
Its just like topping up your debit card - you only need to add more money to it when you're low (more mined transactions) but you don't need to continually send more. 
So yes, the fees per user will go down, but the increased usage will hopefully balance that out (more BTC in motion = more fees.)

The ledger only has addresses, which are not tied to an identity. 
The only times that addresses are tied to actual people are when:
* You sign up for an exchange, and withdraw to your address 
* You post your address someone where online tied to your identity

Bitcoin works on a global ledger, called the Blockchain. Miners add pages to this ledger. The pages can only have a certain number of rows on them (the size of a block.)
Miners fill up each page with rows (transactions), but they have to do this efficiently, since there's a limit on the page size. At the same time, nodes who want to perform a transaction broadcast that, and there's a big list of possible rows a miner can put on the page. These are unconfirmed transactions.
Once a miner creates a page and adds the transaction, it becomes confirmed. Further miners check the work they did and add additional confirmations.
One way for miners to choose which transaction to write to the page is by fees. They put the highest fee transactions on the page, and they get extra bitcoin because of that. 
Now I'm sure someone will come along and ask why Bitcoin doesn't just increase the size of the page, so miners can fit more transactions on it? 
First, if you do that without planning, the book gets bigger and heavier each page you add. Now this is all digital, but that data still have to get downloaded by nodes, and that can cost a lot of money since the bigger pages take more and more data.
Second, we have SegWit now. SegWit makes it so parts of the transactions don't count against the page limit. You can fit more transactions on a page - which is the same result people want. 
If more exchanges and people used SegWit, the pages would allow more data and thus the fees would be lower, because there isn't as much competition for limited space on the page.

How would the rogue miner convince the majority of nodes to switch to their "secret" chain? 
They have their block F, which is longer than the main chain block E, but there's already miners working on the main block E. They can't publish their block F as a solution to the main E, because the previous block is different. 
Also, since the difficulty target changes in every block in BCH, wouldn't their blocks be invalid on the main chain as the difficulty would be different?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:38:49
Maybe I'm not understanding then. You have the bad actor who has 51% of the altcoin hash power. They add blocks to their chain, making sure that the sum of the difficulty in their chain is longer.  This happens past the number of confirmations needed on exchanges, where they send their real coins to buy BTC with the altcoin. All this time, they're the only miner on their secret chain. The altcoin would have to not adjust the difficulty during this time. 
After they've done this, they broadcast their solution to a block on the main chain. What block is the solution for? One on the secret chain, or one on the main chain?
If its one on the secret chain, wouldn't the full nodes reject the solution? They'd look at the header, then back to the source of the fork, and see there are double spends, and reject the new block as invalid?
Also, why would the sum of the difficulty on the secret chain be higher than the sum of the difficulty on the main chain? 
Sorry if these are dumb questions, just trying to understand the attack.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:37:50
Nope, it can run on a very small system. The tricky part is figuring out how to make money off your node when others are willing to run them for free to make sure there's routes to their nodes. 
For example, a big exchange might have tons of lightning nodes distributed across the world, the same way they have bitcoin nodes to hear incoming transactions. Depending on how the node routing code works, your node may route very few transactions.

There's a few things to note:
1) If two miners find a valid block at the same time, one of them will become orphaned. 
Let's say everyone is working on block  Miner 1 and Miner 2 both find a valid solution, and both try to create block 500,001. Some set of miners will take Miner 1's and some will take Miner 2's. The network will eventually erase one and fold those transactions into the other, based on how much work has gone on the miner 1 chain vs. the miner 2 chain.
2) Block creation 
Part of the block, for it to be valid, is the coinbase transaction. This is the thing that awards the miner the coins. It has a special input script. It is part of the block generation mechanism. The network gives it a transaction ID and it has a place in the block, once it is accepted and confirmed.  
This article might help:

That statement is wrong. It IS the difficulty that matters. 
(specifically the comment in that last one: "...floor(2^256 / (target + 1)), where 'target' is the target threshold converted from the 'nBits' field of the block header. (See the GetBlockProof function in src/pow.cpp.) " )

There is no risk of losing coins in unconfirmed transactions. It’ll either confirm and your coins goto the place you wanted or it’ll drop out of the mempool in a week and it’ll be like it never happened. 
It is possible people could spend the coins before the transaction gets confirmed if they send the same thing with a higher fee, or if they use  RBF transaction. 
A double spend isn’t possible - the coins can only move once from the same set of inputs.

The CME futures allow banks and institutions to make a bet on the price of bitcoin in the future. By buying one, they effectively lock in the price (of 5 coins) at some price per coin on some future date.
This lets them manage the risk of prices falling or rising too quickly as they take positions in BTC.
For example, let's say Large Mining Co, which has a 1EH farm, wants to protect their investment. Since they're a miner, they're naturally long - they want the price to go up. However, they want to make sure they can still pay their power bill if the price falls. 
They'll buy futures at a certain price, to protect the value of their coins. No matter what BTC is priced at, they'll always be able to get that price per coin. 
 If the price falls, they settle their contract and get paid that amount.

Block chains are only as secure as the consensus and signing mechanisms. 
Bitcoin elegantly solves this by having your wallet handle things like key generation - you’re not given one, but one is produced in a secure cryptographic way.
Voting is harder because you need more data to make sure your key is issued only to an eligible voter. This would require a database itself - so there’s one source of failure. 
Another is that people are really bad at remembering secure keys - so you’d need some device or way for people to store them and the use them. This is more expensive.
Finally, you need a consensus mechanism. Mining provides this for bitcoin, but you’d need a similar scheme for voting - the government would likely control this, so throw decentralized and trustless out the window.
All this means that whole block chain is good solution for this, the accessibility of the technology for use cases like this isn’t quite there, at least not in a way that’s orders of magnitude cheaper or more efficient than the current system.

Before SegWit, fees were calculated based on the bytes in the transaction. SegWit allows you to calculate fees based on the "weight" of a block. 
If you spend coins from non-SegWit outputs, that weight is always the full bytes they represent. If you spend coins from a SegWit address, the weight is lower because there are elements that don't count in the fee calculation.
You can consolidate your non-SegWit transactions into SegWit ones by generating a new SegWit address and sending your non-SW coins to that (when the fees are low for best results.) 
Then, when you send those coins, you'll get the lower SegWit fees. 
Coinbase can also do this, but they have to update their wallet systems in order to both generate SegWit receiving addresses and also do whatever balancing between their addresses to use SegWit addresses as well.

Let's say you buy at $18k today with Jan 12th as the settlement. 
If the spot price according to the CME index is $20k on that date, you pay the person who bought the future $2k per coin. (So $10k for a CME) 
If the price is lower, they pay you the difference.

Right now, the difficulty is rising around 30% a month. That means that every month, you get 30% fewer coins than the previous month. 
This is how the network makes sure that a block is found on average every 10 minutes - it makes the hash you have to find while mining that much more difficult.

A forked coin takes the BTC blockchain and clones it. That means your addresses that you have now also have a balance on the forked chain. 
In order to take advantage of this, you need to:
1. Control your keys (you said you do)
2. On the BTC blockchain, move your coins somewhere safe
3. On the forked blockchain, claim your coins. This usually is risky because you have to download their wallet (untrusted software) and then enter your private key into it (if you moved your coins, that address is empty on the main chain anyway.) 
4. In the forked coin client, you enter your private key and your balance should show up after you rescan the blockchain/download it. 
5. You send the forked coins to an exchange that lists these scamcoins and you can trade them there.
6. Once the trade is done, you should move your coins off the exchange onto your normal BTC wallet and delete the scamcoin/fork wallet.

You only lose revenue if those people are sending BTC directly 10, 100, or 1000 times on the mainnet today. If that's the case, yes, you're no longer paying the fees on those TXs. But is that happening? 
If you have a way for more people to use their coins, then more coins will be sent to LNs. More coins not sitting in Trezors or on Exchanges, but used for goods and services means more opens (and closes). 
So I don't think anyone can really answer what the difference will be - will more opens and closes balance out the fewer per user transactions?

You can't mine any meaningful amount Bitcoin with a PC, a GPU, a Raspberry Pi, or anything like that, no matter how powerful your system is.
You need specialized machines (called ASIC miners), that take a bunch (around 1500w) or power, convert that 99.9% to heat (5000 btu) and have very loud (70 db) fans to move that heat off the chips.
If you can find a place to run them and you have cheap power, and you can buy them for close to their retail price, and the network difficulty doesn't shoot through the roof every two weeks, it is profitable.

Coinbase needs to verify your ~~identity~~ ownership of the account. They use a service from a company called Plaid to do this. Plaid has connections to different banks, and logs in to your bank account to verify information.
This is similar to how companies like Mint.com or Personal Capital power their software that lets you see all your bank and investment and credit accounts on one page. **It is extremely common in FinTech apps.**
If you don't feel comfortable, you'll need to live with the low limits Coinbase gives to non-verified accounts.
Many banks realize people want this, so they've upgraded their systems to support a technology called oAuth. oAuth lets you login to your bank's site (they serve up the page), and you can authorize apps like Coinbase to access your information. So you could alternatively ask your bank why they don't support modern technologies like this.

Bitcoin's value comes as its utility increases. The more you can use it, the more valuable it becomes. As a new technology, it also has a lot of potential that people haven't realized. It also has value because it is NOT controlled by the government - as people lose trust in the government and banks to do things that align with their values, they have Bitcoin.


How? They can make exchanging it harder, but then they lose their ability to track and tax it. As long as people have internet access, they can transact in Bitcoin, whether the government wants to allow it or not. 


There are futures trading already, Bitcoin is actively competing with serious financial instruments. See above about killing it.

bitcoind). To use this mode, you need to specify the URL of your bitcoind node
using the usual pool options (--url, --userpass, etc), and the --coinbase-addr
option to specify the Bitcoin address you wish to receive the block rewards
mined. If you are solo mining with more than one instance of BFGMiner (or any
other software) per payout address, you must also specify data using the
--coinbase-sig option to ensure each miner is working on unique work. Note
that this data will be publicly seen if your miner finds a block using any
GBT-enabled pool, even when not solo mining (such as failover). If your
bitcoin node does not support longpolling (for example, bitcoind 0.8.x), you
should consider setting up a failover pool to provide you with block
notifications. Note that solo mining does not use shares, so BFGMiner's adjusted
hashrate (third column) may suddenly drop to zero if a block you submit is
rejected; this does not indicate that it has stopped mining.

You're not guessing a number - you're brute forcing a hash. The SHA needs to have a certain number of bytes (the difficulty), which is expressed as leading zeros. 
In addition, you're also hashing:
* The hash of all the TX hashes in the block you're processing (the merkle root)
* The timestamp of your hash 
* The previous block
and some other static data. 
So you take your random number, hash it with all this data, and see if its above the target. If not, you try again.

Difficulty would have to lower in order to make the network usable. This would mean no transactions would get through for at least a few months, as difficulty can only drop so much per adjustment (by a factor of 4.)
So imagine that it now takes around 10m for a block to be created. 99% of the hash power dies for some reason, so it takes 10x as long - 100m per block. The difficulty would adjust in 2016 blocks, so if this ASIC death happened right after a difficulty adjustment, it'd be another 3360 hours (or 20 weeks) before the difficulty dropped by 4. This would mean 25m block times and then it'd adjust again. (see  where I stole their example.)
If there were a global EMP or solar flare, we'd have a lot bigger problems than just Bitcoin not working. Transportation would grind to a halt, refrigeration would stop working, most of the cities would starve, and all the doomsday preppers would say "I told you so!"

Your coins are only at risk if you use them from an address and don’t have a new change address. The public key is hashed in a one way function by RIPEMD and SHA256, which are quantum resistant. It isn’t expected that quantum computers will have an impact on these.
When you send coins your public key is exposed and that’s when a QC could in theory break your private key. 
If you have an unused change address for the unspent outputs, as has been the case for most major wallets over the past few years, you’re coins won’t have their public key exposed.

Ripple is a few things: 
1. A company
1. A network
1. A coin
The company has been making lots of deals with banks, who are using the network. That's great, some real world applications for a blockchain-like technology.
However, the coin isn't really tied to these things. In order to run the ripple network, you need just a few XRP, in total. 
The majority of the coins are owned by the company, and its founders. They are issued at will and 100% premined. 
Ripple is no different than a gift card in this respect. There is no scarcity, no limited supply, and the founders are cashing out big time. Jed McCabe, of MtGox fame, is selling 750m ripple next year and billions in the following years, for example.

Imagine you're a farmer, and you know you'll have a crop of corn in a few months, but you need the money now. You agree to sell a certain amount for a certain price in the future, and you will deliver that amount to whomever has that contract. Let's say you agree to sell 5,000 bushels of corn in March for $352 a bushel.  
The person who buys that guarantees they'll give you the $1,760,000 for your crop. 
That is a future (with physical delivery) - it is an obligation to pay a set amount for something at future date. 
In the case of Bitcoin, the futures are for 5 bitcoin, but are settled in cash. No bitcoin actually changes hands. 
So a miner, for example, can enter into a futures contract to get at least $20,000 per coin, or $100,000 at some point in the future. If the price goes up, let's say to $30k a coin, the miner pays the person who holds the contract $50k (the difference between the contract price and the spot price.) If the price drops, the other person pays the miner.

The network tries to make sure there is a block roughly every 10 minutes. In order to do this, it adjusts a parameter called the difficulty. 
Mining is the act of trying to find a random number that, when hashed with other elements of the network, has a value. If the hash has is valid and meets the difficulty, a new block is created.
In the beginning, the difficulty was 1 - this meant that even a CPU could mine and be expected to submit valid blocks. That has constantly risen as more hash power comes onto the network. Today, it is 1.7 trillion. The next increase, in 2016 blocks (or two weeks), could move it above 2 trillion.

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose applies to your holdings as well. If your Bitcoin is worth $1,000,000 and the rest of your assets are worth like $15,000, it is good financial discipline to sell some BTC and reallocate it. 
Just like if you don't have savings to cover an emergency - if something happens, you'd need to sell your coins no matter what price. So better to sell when the price is high and make sure you have that covered in case something bad happens.

I don’t get it myself. BCH has such low hash power that it runs at like 10% of bitcoin’s difficulty. Bitcoin rewards are far more in terms of dollar amount, so I’m not sure why a miner would switch to the lower diff if they were capable of mining on BTC.

It is very hard to do today, because getting your fiat currency into the system requires someone to hold it. That person needs to be licensed in various ways depending on the country they're in. 
A new technology, called Atomic Swaps, is coming soon, which make it easy to exchange altcoins for Bitcoin. However, if you want to buy with your fiat, you still need an exchange to take your country's currency and give you coins for it.

If you knew that you could send transaction A to a miner, and they exclusively knew about it and didn't relay it, you could then perform that same TX and relay it to other nodes as well. Since the bad miner isn't relaying, the transaction would look ok to the network. 
I think you're missing out that it is a peer to peer network. Most people don't send their transactions only to a certain host - they get spread all over. If one miner doesn't relay it, other nodes will. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:14:07
 has a good table listing it. 
The following are "discarded" (and by that they're not multiplied by 4 in the weight.)
Desc | Raw Byte Count 
SegWit Marker | 1 
SegWit Flag | 1 
Number of stack items for input 0 (2) | 1 
Size of stack item 0 (72)	 | 1 
Stack item 0, signature | 72
Size of stack item 1 (33) | 1
Stack item 1, pubkey| 33
Total Witness Data |  110 	
The TX size is actually a little bigger in bytes, but the **weight**, which is what the fee is based on, is smaller.

No one is giving away free money. They're getting paid by app developers to have you download their apps.
So you may have "made" $42 but this company has made $150, for example. 
Eventually, app developers will realize that no one who comes to them through this channel is paying, so they'll drop it, and then the company goes away. You should always cash out your money in schemes like this as soon as you can.

That's a fair assessment. 
I was trying to convey that the network only works if miners (the systems including transactions in blocks) act in a way that doesn't prevent the network from being efficient, with the goal that more usage of Bitcoin means more profits. Its especially true today, when they've invested millions in ASIC equipment that has no other purpose.
That investment should provide an incentive to keep honest and not harm the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:06:49
The network is peer to peer. A node that's sending relays that to all of the connected nodes. They relay that in turn.
A miner's node relays the same way that a full node running on your raspberry pi does.

So 189,000 video cards. $700 each = $132,300,000
Assume 500w per card, you'd need PSUs that output 94,500kw. 
A server grade 2kw PSU is around $700,  so that's that $33,075,000.
$165,375,000 spent so far. 
Now, each of those cards gets what - 100mh?  Total of 18,900 th/s.
Instead, if you had spent your money on ASICs, you could buy that same amount of hashrate around $3,500,000 (~1500 or so S9s.)

Think of blockchain as a database for your web server, but that other devices can use as well, even if they're not on your network.

Hey no problem - you'll find different people have a different level of trust in the financial system, companies, and things like that.
I've worked in VC, startups, and finance my whole career, so I have a bias towards seeing how these things help companies grow and create new things. I'm a huge fan of open source too, and I encourage companies I work with to let developers work on side projects during their day job.

Things have a value based on their utility and scarcity. 
Bitcoin is scarce by design, so it has that. So what is the utility that gives it value?
A few things:
1.  Speculation - Lots of people are putting lots of money speculating that it'll increase in value. 
2.  Replacement of Fiat in certain counties - For example, Venezuela. 
3. A medium of exchange - People do buy things with BTC (I know I do.) Everything from mining products to overstock. Additionally, there's been lots of use cases in charity, for example the $80m fund just announced.
4. The most successful and widely used Blockchain use case - As the technology that Blockchain was invented for, Bitcoin is its most widely used example. People are betting that the issues it has today will be solved by the creative developers working on it, which would cause its utility to increase and thus its value.

Not in terms of power costs, but much moreso in terms of bandwidth.
Your miner uses a lot of power and very little bandwidth. A node uses a little power and a lot of bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:16:27
Your wallet reaches out to nodes - that's one of its main functions. Nodes then relay the transaction.
There is no incentive for miners to to relay transactions, only to solve blocks. When they solve a block, they tell the network which transactions they're including in that block. They get the fees for all those transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:35:58
SegWit reduces the size of **how** transactions **are calculated**. It means that your total fee is smaller, because a fee is per byte. 
You still use the size of the transaction to calculate your fees, though.  (edited to be more accurate and clear.)

No - they bet the price will fall. 
Basically, they borrow bitcoin from another party and sell it immediately. They promise to give that party back the same amount of coins at a future time. 
They're betting the price drops and then they can buy cheaper - they make the difference the price when they sold to when they bought and returned to the entity they borrowed them from. 
For example, they goto someone who has a lot of coins, like the Winkelvoss twins. The borrow 100 BTC, and sell immediately. If the price drops $2k per coin, they buy those 100BTC and give them back to the twins. (The twins would charge them a fee for borrowing of course.)

Yes, it'd be a 51% attack like normal, then. Bitcoin acknowledges this, in saying that it should always be more beneficial for a miner to use their power to honestly generate coins. 
But a 51% is possible with any altcoin - that is why exchanges often want more confirmations with them.

Bankers have money, experience in finance, and connections. Startup companies need all those things to become big companies and gain their own money, experience, and connections. 
Bankers invest in startup companies. 
Just because someone invests in a company, doesn't mean they control its operations or strategic decisions. Most of the time, they have goals for the company to meet around new product launches, growing the company, etc. How the company hits those goals is what sets a good executive team and their ability to execute apart.
Bitcoin is an open source product. In the same way that dozens of people who work at companies like Microsoft develop for flavors of Linux, people who know about Bitcoin work at these companies because they pay well and give them a chance to use their knowledge. As part of this, most of the developers also get to work on Bitcoin while still having their day job at these companies. 
Imagine if you got paid to do what you'd do for (or were doing) for free anyway - pretty good deal. If that money comes from bankers, what do you care? If they tell you to do something you do agree with, you can get a job at one of the other companies in the same space, or start your own.

This is a very bias view. The fees are actually low on per BTC basis, but the value of Bitcoin has risen so many that when you compare the fees to USD, they're relatively high. (They're even higher in other currencies too!) No crypto currency has solved this - as their values relative to USD rise, the fees also rise. If the value rises thousands of percent like BTC, the fees do as well.


No. What needs to happen is for the scaling solutions proposed by the development teams, like sidechains, to be available. These allow instant payments for almost no fees. 
Furthermore, people can opt-in to using SegWit, which lowers TX size so it lowers fees. Right now, most exchanges don't support it - so you're not getting those benefits.

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:38:54
Yes, this is exactly how it works. 
Users set a fee on their transaction. Miners pick the transactions to include based on their own criteria, but one would assume the highest fee TX would be one of them.  Low fee transactions might get included in certain circumstances - like if the mining pool was paying out a block it discovered, or if the pool operated a service for its members to include their transactions with low fees.
However, every low fee included when there is a higher fee option is leaving money on the table.

There is a limit on how many TXs can be included in a block. This is there to prevent spam transactions.
Miners will take a set of transactions and include them in a block. The fee helps them decide which TXs to include - the higher the fee, the better the chances are for it to be included.

Part of the block header is the previous block, so it's highly unlikely that hashing the previous block will give you a valid new one. 
Most modern miners can exhaust the nonce space in seconds, so they also modify parts of the merkle root and the coinbase transaction to get more space to work with. 
The timestamp is a UNIX timestamp - you can get it by calling TIME on any UNIX system.

Teraflops aren't applicable to mining. A generalized GPU set of chips will never beat a specialized ASIC. 
Teraflops measure floating point math. Mining uses integers. 
1mh/s is about equal to 12.7 tflops (but again, its apples to oranges), so 110 tflops give you about 10 mh/s.

* It has survived countless deaths, and proved resilient 
* It is being integrated with the legacy financial system through futures, a precursor to ETFs and other ways to trade it 
* The exchanges that exist today are better than ever, with it being pretty easy for new people to get coins
* Mining has exploded, becoming a billion dollar business 
* People are trusting governments less and less and technology more
* There is greater uncertainty in the world
* It has proved to be useful in situations like Venezuela where the currency and economy have collapsed 
* New scaling solutions have been demoed on the mainnet and running on the testnet (segwit, lightning, drivechains, side chains)
*  The network is still secure 
* While new altcoins have come and gone, none have the widespread usage, overall size, and utility of Bitcoin

Usually it is tied to low volume and a pump. For example, a coin will spam subreddits with how it is revolutionary, get YouTube videos covering it, make memes, spam their bitcointalk announcement with rumors, etc.
If you have low volume, you can set your sell price to be relatively high. You can then make a few buy orders at that high price, and that furthers the pump. The people looking for the next get rich with no effort coin flood in.

You need to hash: 
Field | Purpose | Size (Bytes)
Version | Block version number	 | 4 | 
hashPrevBlock	 | 256-bit hash of the previous block header	 | 32 | 
hashMerkleRoot | 256-bit hash based on all of the transactions in the block	 | 32 | 
Time | Current timestamp as seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00 UTC	 | 4 | 
Bits | Current target in compact format	 | 4 | 
Nonce | 32-bit number (starts at 0)	 | 4 | 
Source: 
You'd need the values from the blockchain for hashPrevBlock and hashMerkleRoot, as well as convert them to Hex. I don't think a web-based SHA256 tool would do it. You'd also do a double SHA256 hash.
You increment the nonce until you find one that has the target number of zeroes, which is currently at 19.

In order to hit these targets, you'd need better chips. The current 16nm chips would draw too much power and would require too many of them to meet these specs. 
If you could shrink the chip to 7nm, then you could fit double the chips into a smaller area and you might get closer. Sidehack's USB pod prototype specs say he has a 35W, 88GH design with 8 BM1387 chips. If you could double the efficiency of chips in that space, you could in theory pull 160 GH for that 35w.

What I'd do is I would sit on the solutions for the next 6 hours - let's say I have enough hashpower to solve 10 blocks/hour at the reduced difficult. With this. So when the EDA actually does kick in, I will already have a backlog of 60 blocks, that I can start to release. Let's say I release the first one right away, and then release one every minute after that.
You can't pre-mine a block. Part of the block requires the hash of the previous block, something you can't possibly know until it is mined.

Armory just knows that its monitoring an address. The blockchain has the balance of that address. Without the blockchain installed on your computer, Armory has no database. 
You can get bitcoin core here: 
Think of armory like a second layer. It doesn't interact with the Bitcoin network on its own. It needs the Bitcoin application to download the blockchain database. Note - it'll take between an hour and 72 hours based on your download speed to download and sync the blockchain (it is over 160 gb).

FLOPS isn't really the right thing to compare. What you want is the speed to do a sha256 hash. 
If we assume a processor can get 10 mh/s (optimistic) , and
the current network hashrate is around 4 exahash, that means that you'd need around 439 billion processors to match that.
The economics of doing would make it infeasible.

The longest chain is meaningless when you're talking about two separate blockchains. 
If you're talking about single chain, the longest chain is the series of blocks that have the most additions to it. 
Let's say you have block 10. Two miners, working independently, each find a valid hash that would give you block 11. They both submit them to the network, and the network starts working on block 12. Some part of the network will work to add more blocks off 11a, another part will work on 11b. 
Eventually, some people will add blocks to 11a and some to 11b. You'll get blocks 12a, 12b, etc. The network decides which is the real chain by looking at who has added the most blocks - the longest chain. If, for example, what was 11a is now on block 14, and 11b is only on 13, 11a becomes the true chain. The other blocks in 11b are orphaned and those transactions go back into the pool to be rebroadcast.
However, if you look at something like Litecoin, which is at block 1,263,021 vs Bitcoin, which is at 481,624, you couldn't say Litecoin is the "real" chain because it is longer. It just has faster block times.

You'd need to offer to buy equity from the owners of the exchange directly, or participate a fundraising round with them. 
That'd be finding out who they are and offering them money, then working with lawyers to draft a term sheet for investment.

Yes sell can move the market if you sell a large amount at market prices. This will eat through the depth of the market (the opposite side orders) until it hits a point where there is no more demand at that price.
Another impact could be to trigger automated stop orders, further selling off orders. This is what caused the ETH flash crash on GDAX a few months ago, where ETH dropped to 10 cents before recovering to over $300.

Think like a VC - you don't invest in an idea, you invest in an application of that idea that has proof that it both works and has a market.
VCs do this by looking at data around traction - are people paying to use this, are user numbers growing, is the time spent on this growing? Do you know why what people are using this thing and have a way to get more people that doesn't involve spending unneeded money? 
If an ICO has this, it makes sense to invest in - but it'll also make sense for accredited investors to also put money into. 
The vast majority of ICOs will fail, and are the new altcoin craze, trying to take advantage of people who hear crypto is a way to get rich quick. Often these are the most desperate people, who have the most to lose, with poor risk management.

Your coins all are credited towards a certain address. To send them from a different one, you'd have to move them into that one.

All miners need a node, but not all nodes are miners. 
A node validates the information that miners relay to the network. Without a node, a miner wouldn't know the critical information they need to mine a block, and they couldn't send the solution to the block to the network. 
Without miners, there would be no blocks for a node to validate, and transactions wouldn't move on the network.

Most sites who have a "forgot your password?" just overwrite your existing password with the new one you pick. They don't give you your old password: that should be impossible to do, since its hashed and not actually stored.
In this case, if they overwrote your old key, it wouldn't tie to your coins anymore. The balance of your coins is tied to a series of addresses, and those addresses are generated by the words that you lost. Without those words, it's pretty much impossible to ever get the keys needed to access your coins.

Your transaction fee is based on the total bytes that you transmit. 
In this case, the person sending you the coins has to pay that fee based on the amount of data they're transmitting. 
When they're pulling coins from multiple addresses, there's more data to pass. If you're transferring from an exchange, for example, they'll do this. 
The fee (which is .15 btc in your screenshot), is paid to miners to incentivize them to include the transaction in the blocks they mine. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:16:09
A private key is used to generate one address. Anyone who has the private key can spend whatever coins are at that address. 
If you want to move to wallets you control, you need to generate a new address that you have the private key to. You can do this through wallet software you download (Bitcoin Core, Armory, Electrum, many others) and Hardware wallets (Trezor, for example)
For example, you could download Electrum, and generate a new wallet. It'll give you a seed - a set of words - you must remember these words. If you lose these words, you lose access to your coins. 
From there, you send the coins to an address you have in the wallet you just downloaded and setup. As long as you have the words used for the wallet, you can re-create the private keys, and you can access your coins.

A few days ago, I made the mistake of "only" paying a 50 satoshi/byte fee. My transaction sat unconfirmed for a few days.
I used the ViaBTC transaction accelerator to finally get it on the chain. 
They only allow 100 "accelerations" per hour, so you need to post your TX ID and the captcha there almost immediately when the clock hits the top of the hour. Then, they only include it in blocks they mine - so it might be a few blocks until your TX is included.
You can also message people on here who have the ability to include your TX in their pools or the P2Pool queue. 
I've started using  to look at the fees needed to get a TX on the network faster for anything that's high priority.

Coinbase has thousands of addresses with a balance in its hot wallet. When a user requests to send, it'll take it from one of those with the right balance. If that address had more than you sent (.12 in this example), the change went to another address that they have.
The fee is the number you saw in the bottom row, 0.00115828.

Coinbase is kind of like a bank. Your coins exist in their ledger, credited to you as the owner. 
They pay lots of money for security professionals to work for them, keep their systems updated, and guard against loss. However, if they ever disappear for some reason, your coins are gone with them. It'd be similar to if you had more than $250k in a US bank account and the bank folded - your amount over the FDIC insurance would be wiped out.
Now, think about what it'd be if you had the money in your bank account as cash or gold or something else. The security is all on you. You need to make sure your devices are clean, safe from things like fire, flood damage, robbery, etc. 
How does the risk of these things weigh against the risk of a company going away and you losing your coins on their systems? 
If you're willing to take those risks of security onto yourself, yes, you can move it to wallet app. This means that if anything ever happened and you lose your coins, it is on you. 
Some people they'd trust themselves over anyone else, or have been burned by trusting a third party with their coins, and are willing to take the risk on themselves. Others aren't, and would rather just leave that to the bank/exchange/online wallet. 
At the end of the day, its up to you.

1. Find the Bitcoin plugin/add-on for whatever language you use. 
2. Write a function that will generate your private keys, and encrypt them with whatever algorithm you want. (Make sure you have a way to access the keys to your encrypted keys.) 
3. Write another app that watches the price. Once it reaches your threshold, have that thing send you the keys.
4. Send your coins to the addresses generated in step 1
You'd need:
* A way to securely store your keys to decrypt your BTC private keys on the check points
* A way to store the encrypted bitcoin keys 
* Self control to not decrypt the keys before that 
Also, please be sure to test, either on the testnet or using smaller amounts

Yes, you need to apply for higher limits. This takes time, because they do a higher level of identity check.


Are you talking about cash? A bank will file a SAR (suspicious activity report) but that doesn't really mean anything. Unless you're routinely taking out tens of thousands of dollars of cash, you shouldn't have anything to worry about. If you ARE withdrawing that much cash, why would you even move your wealth out of crypto? If you're okay with keeping it in a bank, you don't need to withdraw it. Having it in a bank ties you into the financial system, and you can use your money for whatever you want.


At least in the US, as long as you pay taxes, the banks don't really care where your profit comes from. They'll take their cut for holding it, or providing credit against it, or whatever else they do.

In the US, the taxes on gifts are paid by the person giving the gift. There is a lifetime exemption of $5.4 million and an annual exemption of $14,000. 
So if someone gave you $13k in BTC, no one pays any tax. If they gave you $1 million, they'd just exclude that from their lifetime exemption.  If they gave you $6 million, they'd need to pay a tax on that $1 million.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:43:51
You need to understand your costs and then plan for how to meet them. A moderate lifestyle in San Francisco, CA costs a lot more than a moderate lifestyle in Omaha, Nebraska. 
Let's say your monthly costs today are 1btc. That means you'd need 12 btc a year. So your formula is 12btc * # of years you'll be retired. 
Let's say you retire when you're 40 - that's 40 years in retirement, or 480 btc. If you want to retire when you're 50, that's only 360.
Note, this doesn't factor in the change in purchasing power in BTC. It is possible that tomorrow, you only need .7 btc to live not because of your lifestyle change, but because the purchasing power of your coins went up.

Yes - you could say your shares in your non-public company are worth $2 billion, but they'd want to make sure that there is some reasonable market value to your assets. Thus, they need to know what the assets are and how you valued them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:38:49
There has never been a time that the S9 wasn't profitable if you have the right power costs (I believe its under 15c per Kw/h)
With that being said, there's a few new miners on the horizon. Canaan is releasing the A8, which should have similar S9 power consumption and likely better hashrate. The dragon mint thing is coming out in March, and the Whatsminer M3 will be shipping in Jan. (Even though its not as powerful as an S9). Keep in mind if you want an S9 today, you couldn't get it. The S9s I ordered 3 months ago just shipped today, for example.
With all the competition, it seems likely that Bitmain will respond with SOMETHING to try to maintain their marketshare.


Difficulty changes every 2016 blocks, about 2 weeks. It always rises as more hashrate is produced.
I helped a friend setup a mine earlier this year. He spent around $12k on the equipment. It produces around .3 coins a month. Had he spent the $12k on BTC, he'd have about 4x the value in fiat now. 
Mining is not an easy way to profit (unless you're incredibly lucky) - it is a long term thing of turning your dollars now into a slow trickle of coins. 
If you have the power, the space, the HVAC and the patience, it can be a great way to get coins over time. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:28:03
Of course. The network worked fine with just a few nodes and computers in 2010, why wouldn't it in 2018?

Difficulty would drop by a factor of 4 after the first 2016 blocks, and then continue to drop the next 2016 until it found the right 10 minute block time. 
No need for a new POW - the network can survive with must lower hashrate, just like it did a few years back.
However, transactions would be very slow for these 4 weeks.

How much is your electric costs? Can you store dozens of machines that are super loud and produce a ton of heat (and vent that heat) over long periods of time?
Can you subsidize this activity with other income to pay for power bill, machine upgrades to keep up with difficulty, and other costs?
If your power cost is low, and you can handle setting up a miniature data center, mining can be very profitable. 
If all you want to do is make as much money as you can, just buy coins. 
My mine has paid for itself in less than 6 months, the rest is all profit. I live in a high cost of power state (CA), too. I have rolled profits into upgrades, so I'm not pocketing the money, I'm reinvesting it in the mine.

ECC is not quantum resistant. That means that if an attack knows your public key, they could derive your private key. If you follow common practices and use change addresses, you'll be safe. Only addresses that have 1) sent coins and 2) keep a balance would be vulnerable.

Coinbase owns GDAX.
Coinbase is for people who just want to buy at the market price, from Coinbase's stock of coins ("consumers")
GDAX is an exchange for people who want to do more complex trades, set things like limit/stop orders, and other typical "trading" activities. ("traders")
Coinbase likely uses GDAX as a liquidity source - they'll buy/sell on there as needed based on the activities in the consumer site.
Fees to buy/sell are lower on GDAX for non-market orders. That means that if the market is at $15,010, you have to set your buy/sell to be $15,020 or $15,000 to be lower fee.

Coinbase waits for a certain amount of confirmations before it lets you spend the coins. Right, blocks are taking around 10 minutes or so, so if they require 6 confirmations, it'll take around 60 minutes. 
See: 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:37:25


Transactions have no impact on blocks. A block always has one transaction: the block reward (called a coinbase transaction). This block happens even if there 0 or 30,000 transactions.
The only impact that transactions have is that only ~1mb worth can fit into a block. So if you have a lot of transactions, it'll more blocks to get through them, but blocks are generated at roughly 1 every 10 minutes.

Basically, there are more than one valid solution to the next block. Let's say miner  in Russia, finds one solution and broadcasts that. Miner  in Argentina, at the same time, finds another solution and broadcasts that.
In this case, the nodes around miner  think the current block is X, and the ones are  think it is Y.
Eventually, one of these blocks will be "orphaned" - basically it is erased from the chain. The network decides this by seeing which has the most work done after it - the longest chain. Any transactions on the orphaned chain get reincorporated back into future blocks. 


The network is capable of validating pretty quickly. A merchant could have a node that does this simple validation, and allow 0 confirmation transactions. Its just a question of how much risk the purchase is. For your groceries, that could work pretty well. But for bigger things, like a house, you might want to wait until a few confirmations validate the transaction.
The problem is that a user could try to game the system, but relay two transactions at once at opposite ends of the world, and attempting to double spend that way. However, as long as the retailers nodes were setup at multiple points on the network, this shouldn't be a big risk.

A wallet holds a set of keys - one private, belonging only to you that should never be shared, and a public one, that has some hashing done to it to get your address. You can safely share your address. A wallet holds hundreds of these keypairs.


Do not use "Brain Wallets", where you generate an address from a phrase you made up. 


Coinbase do I write down? And lets say Coinbase gets hacked and no one has access to it anymore. Does the code I have written down on my paper really means, that I still have all my Bitcoins?
Coinbase doesn't give you the data you need to write down, which is a private key. That's why people say don't store your coins on there long term. You need that private key. 


Yes, it takes time to sync the blockchain for a full wallet. This is more secure than those that don't, but only minimally.  You can also download an SPV wallet like Electrum. This uses nodes that are run by other people to validate transactions - it adds an element of trust to the process (you have to trust the person running the node).

Every day, around 144 blocks are added to the chain. That means that today, 1800 new Bitcoin are generated per day. In the future, that number will half until there are .0000001 new bitcoin generated per day. 
As long as the market is buying more than 1.8k Bitcoin a day, the price can go up (assuming these are all sold, which they're not.)
If the demand drops and people don't buy, the price will go down.

Theres a lot of different uses for derivatives, and they don't always directly impact the underlying security, but they are impacted by it.
For example, a mortgage backed security doesn't directly impact the price of the mortgages that its composed of. An option on a stock doesn't impact the price of the underlying stock. 
However, without an option, institutions lack ways to manage risk around their positions or leverage up their positions in case they need it. 
For example, a trader might have puts to protect their downside. If they didn't have those puts, they might not be able to enter the trade. Likewise, an LBO firm might use calls to guarantee they're able to buy enough shares to do a takeover. 
In this case, they'd use the calls to guarantee they could buy shares at a certain price - if the underlying security goes up on news of the take over, they're locked in at the lower call price. 
So - not really an impact on the underlying security, but the underlying security heavily impacts the derivative. 
Note: The volume of derivatives can far out number the actual number of underlying securities in some markets, because you can have derivatives on derivatives.

There is a file that has the balance of your addresses called btc.txt. One group is making a copy of that file and calling it 2x.doc.
You now have a balance in btc.txt, and the same balance in 2x.doc. You can't open the btc.txt file with a 2x reader, and you can't open a 2x.doc with a btc.txt reader. 
No matter what happens, you still have your same amount of coins. You just have an equal amount in a different program.
If everyone uses the new program, you just need to use that program to access your coins. If everyone uses the old program, you're fine, nothing changes. If some people use one and some others use the other one, you can sell your coins on one and have some more coins on the other.

Let's do the math!
$50k will buy you: 
* Around 30 Antminer S9s with power supplies and shipping, which won't arrive until January 
* You'll also need a way to power 45 kilowatts, a place to put them that can deal with the sound of 30 vacuum cleaners running 24x7, putting out 153,000 btu of heat.
At current difficulty, this will produce around 2 BTC a month, but your power will be between $3k - $6k a month. 
Plus you'll have to secure your warehouse or storage area, install internet, switches, monitoring software all of that.
Spend your $50k on the coin unless you have a warehouse, with plenty of cheap power, good HVAC, and cashflow to balance out when your pool has bad luck for several weeks on end.

Good point - as of right now, CoinMarketCap lists the 24h volume at $4,431,880,000- 535,177 volume @ $8281.14, with a .61% 24h increase. 
So if you take 20x that volume (half buys, half sells), you get a linear price increase of 12.20%. 
Of course it'd rise more than this, as that'd mean 1/3rd of the coins that exist would need to change hands.

You owe taxes when you realize a gain. That means per transaction. For example, let's say you have 5 trades. The ones I bold are taxable events.
1. Buy $5000 of BTC. Value of this BTC goes up $1000.
2. **Sell BTC to buy LTC** (sell $6k of BTC for $6k of LTC) ($1000 gain)
3. **Sell LTC to buy ETH** (LTC has gone up to $7000. $1k gain)
4. **Sell ETH to buy BTC** (ETH has gone up to $7500. $500 gain)
5. **Sell BTC for USD** (BTC has gone to the moon. $2000 gain) 
So in that case, you owe short term capital gains (ie: your income tax marginal rate) on the money you made between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5. In my fictional example, thats a $5500 gain at your marginal tax rate.
You should absolutely report all income on your taxes. 
Whenever you make a trade, you owe tax on the gains, or you can reduce your taxable income by the loss amount if you sold at a loss.

No, Bitcoin won't be surpassed by a different coin. It is the central crypto.
Centralized mining **pools** is different than centralized mining. People can always move their hashrate to other pools - different pools at different times have had more than 50% hash rate and the world didn't end. As long as people are watchful, pool centralization isn't a big issue.

10 minutes was chosen because its a good "goldilocks" number. It balances a few competing things:
* Shorter than 10m risks wasting hash power in minority chains, as orphan blocks get created more frequently
* More orphan chains also mean longer time to re-organize those transactions, meaning slower transaction times
* More bandwidth would be needed for faster blocks
Now, other coins have shorter proof of work - you get some benefits here, like faster confirmation times, but the downside above. If you find a way to solve these and shorten the block time, you should post it as a BIP change - remember, this is all open source.

No need to be a jerk, especially if someone could help you.
So your ideal solution would be that this site watches for new forks, and alerts you. You then provide the site your key for the empty address. 
The site then sends the coins to your exchange account to dump, or dumps them with an API key.

They could certainly regulate it, and ban things like banks transacting with exchanges, which would make it pretty tough to get fiat from it.

Anyone who has 101 coins at current prices has over a million dollars in BTC.
That means there is a maximum of 165,405 possible Bitcoin millionaires. 
If you look at the "Rich List", 23% of the coins are in wallets that have between 100 - 1000. If we think about these as individuals, that means there's 16,419 bitcoin millionaires as part of this. (Wallets with more than 1000 are mostly exchanges or other institutional wallets.)
There's also people who have created Bitcoin services that are likely millionaires - founders like the Coinbase guys, for example.

Snarky reply: If you have to ask, you probably shouldn’t be trading futures.
Actual reply: Futures are traded on exchanges and used for risk management in the case of cash settled futures like bitcoin. Talk to your broker or see if your trading system allows you to buy futures and the liquidity requirements.
According to the contract specs, each future is 5 BTC - so factor that in and realize you’ll be settling $35k per contract if btc is $7k.
Futures are for institutional players, not really for individual investors.

Yes - some pools still mine empty blocks. 


No - the transaction validation happens pretty much instantly. If the transaction is valid, it is added to a list of transactions for the miner to include in a block. Part of the block is something called the merkle root - it is a hash of all the transactions in that block. If a miner tries to include an invalid transaction, others will reject the entire block. 
The 10 minutes is the time it takes to find a proof of work. This is a hash of the elements of the block (including the merkle root above) that meets the network difficulty.

Using your language example:
Someone can come up with a new word, but they then have to get the network to support it. This is done through discussion and submissions to the source code repositories of Bitcoin. 
If your word is useful, can be verified as working well, tested in conversation, then it can be accepted into the dictionary (the codebase.)

You can't spend the coins in the genesis block. They're forever tied to that address.
The reason for this is because the genesis coinbase transactions isn't part of the UXTO data set, it is hard coded into the client. 
4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b is not a valid transaction to current Core clients.

No miner in the wild today supports this. You need a change to the mining software (most of which is based on cgminer) in order to enable this, as it requires new logic when hashing.

Maybe, we have no proof. I know some large miners who have a dozen or petahash and good relationships with Bitmain and they're still on S9s.

It is even worse than that. Their chips will not run on any pool that doesn't have ASICBOOST enabled. You're forced to use one of the pools that support it - or your miner won't run. (If they didn't have ASICBOOST, it hashes at 4TH/s according to CK on Bitcointalk.)

I think this the article:

The transaction fees will need to cover the costs of mining. This could mean a few things:

To anyone who wants to invest in fancy, magical miners using state of the art die processes that big companies like Intel barely do: ask for proof.
That's what I'd want from GMO. So far they've released a lot of PR about their mining, but not much about if these miners even work. For all we know their mine is full of S9s. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:21:41
What's your network setup like? The best way would be to block port 22 from outside coming inside at your router's firewall. This would prevent the remote attack from connecting to your miner.
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:18:20
Typically new hardware comes out every 2-4 years. The size of the chips used in the miners shrinks and gets more efficient. Right now, the S9 is on 16nm chips. There will be a lot of research and development into getting to smaller chips. 
16nm is pretty good, but Intel, for example, is producing processors at 10nm. (Keep in mind Intel has vastly more experience, money, and resources than Bitmain and Bitfury, today's main ASIC makers.) 
So expect to replace your shiny miners when a new generation of mining chip is released.
Typically mine will sell in bulk to smaller players, who are upgrading their slightly older machines. The current craze for BTC gear has driven prices super high for used machines, but in more normal times, they'll sell around 50% of retail. 
If you want to run a competitive mine, you'll be switching your gear as much as you can. 
Bitmain is in a great place because they're making the machines, they can run them in their mines while people continue to "pre-order" them - so they basically get free machines, subsidized by all the pre-orders.
You can also go custom - Bitfury will make a shipping container into a miner for around $1 million, for example.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:03:57
This only lists big pools, though. Smaller pools have more variance but can be more profitable due to lower fees.
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:59:33
Bitmain currently runs two of the largest pools:
1.  AntPool - 1077 PH/s
2. BTC.com - 995 PH/s
It rumored they own more, like viaBTC, but they don't admit it.
Right now the most efficient miner is the Antminer S9, which pull around 13 TH/s. A PH is 1000 TH/s. So assuming you could get them, you'd need around 83,000 S9s to have the power of AntPool, and 76,000 to get to BTC.com
In total, that's 159,000 machines. Now the retail price is around $2,000 - so that's a cool $318 million US dollars.
That'll get you around 25% of the hashrate on the network, so in theory you'll around 500 btc a day. 
In order to be profitable, you need your hash rate to generate enough coin to offset your electric costs. There's no such thing as average power costs - CA, for example, pays around 31 cents on average. Oregon pays closer to 10 cents on average.
 can be used to see what hash rates start being profitable to you
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:46:21
To me the big deal is that they advertised a 16th/s miner, but didn't state that number is only if you mine on certain pools. These units ship in a few weeks, so that gives pool owners limited time to support, test, and make sure everything works. 
That's not a lot of time to be messing with your work submission code, nor have I seen that demo units available for pool owners. 
That means that if you get a Dragon in the next month, you can only be guaranteed to mine on three pools: Slush, CK, and CKsolo. 
Yes, other pools can change their code to accept them - but that is out of the buyer's control. You're forcing the buyer to mine at certain pools. It's like if Bitmain said the S9 would only work at Antpool. That'd be a huge centralization. 
I do think other pools will adopt it, but it is still shady to sell something at 16 th/s if it doesn't really run at that speed at all pools.

Yes, there's precedent for it: this is how the US government "banned" online poker. 
What happened was that black market payment processors sprung up, and would transfer money from users under the cover of things like golf balls or t-shirts, and then transfer that to poker sites. 
Because there was so much money at stake, the risk was worth the profits. 
If a government does a similar action, I imagine similar markets would develop. In short, there's too much money being transferred to stop the tide.

You need:
1.  Space with multiple 220V drops 
2.  Power that's around 6 cents per KWh or less
3.  ~$50k to order 60 miners from Canaan w/ controllers and PSUs
4. PDUs and cooling for your space 
All together, you're probably pretty close to your $80k and you haven't even got your first power bill yet.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:54:27
I agree, but its also shady on Halong's part. It is a lie of omission to say your miner works at a certain speed when it only works at that speed on certain pools, and limits the choice of users AFTER they've already bought a machine.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:40:54
You'd have 420 TH/s, which would get you around 41 coins a year. The power usage would be around 72 kw, so if you pay 20 cents per KWh, you'd pay $126,144 a year in electricity.

Why would you panic - you should count the money you've "invested" in BTC lost the second you buy it.

Keep them safe, but don't obsess over the price.  You can buy more, but again, only invest what you can afford to lose.

It's important to buy hardware wallets from trusted stores. They usually ship with a tamper-evident hologram sticker. If it looks like its been messed with, report it to them and ask to exchange.
In the event of a fork, your coins are safe - but you may have issues getting the forked coin balances depending on the rules of the fork. If you just plan to hold your coins, this won't be an issue. 
You might hear about replay protection, and if you're spending coins, this will be an issue you want to watch. There's not much you can do to guard against it except not spend your coins. 
As for the fork, it'll happen in November (if it does happen.)
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:59:10
That's enough to buy an entry level miner from a company like Canaan - but you'd also need the controller (any raspberry pi will do), power supply (HP server series pulling 1200w), breakout boards for the power supply, and PCI-e cables. You'd be about .25 BTC into it by this time.
Then you need a place where you can run the miner - it'll need about 1100w all day, emit around 70 dB of noise, and produce the same heat as a space heater, 24/7.
Based on your power cost, it can be between $100 - $500 (or more) a month. At current difficulty, you'll earn around .05 BTC a month - but the difficulty will likely increase 5-10% (or more) every two weeks, as more miners come online. So after a year you'll have spent way more than .03 BTC, and have maybe .05 BTC.

The higher the difficulty, the more hash rate you need to offset it.
So if difficulty increases by 20% a month, you'd need more than 20% hashrate per month to maintain the same earnings given the fact you're using more power.

Bitcoin could be a threat to certain things that generate revenue for Wall Street firms.
This includes:
*  Settlement fees - There is no need to settle if you transact on Bitcoin's blockchain. Proof of ownership is there and its simply transferring from one address to another.
* Overdraft fees - You can't overdraft from a bitcoin transaction 
* Wire/ACH fees - These would be transaction fees in your Bitcoin wallet, but the bank wouldn't get them
* Account maintenance fees - If you hold your own wallet, no need for these. 
In addition, if more retail investors start moving money away from traditional investment assets (like stocks, bonds, etc.) into crypto, Wall Street would lose out on that cash. Of course the amount of money in crypto is a drop in the ocean compared to the amount in these other vehicles, so this is a far off one.

The main reason to use a hardware wallet is offline storage - since your wallet isn't connected to a computer, it can't be made to sign transactions if someone compromises your system. 
For example, if someone installed a keylogger and remote access hack on your system, they would be able to spend your coins as soon as you spent them once.
A hardware wallet prevents this because you have to plug it in for it to sign the transaction. You can't remotely exploit that.
Bluetooth opens another attack vector - in theory, if the device was in range, your compromised machine could issue a connection to it and request a signature to spend your coins. This negates part of the purpose of a hardware wallet.

There are a few ways you can do it.
When you mine a block, you specify the outputs and scripts for those. You can choose to send some small amount to a certain output format for a vote on an item, or you can use the script output of your coinbase transaction.
Since only miners have coinbase transactions (the transactions that generate new coins), they are "voting".

Sure - any withdrawal from their exchange account would also be replayable to get credit on the other chain.

A quantum computer can't crack your coins unless you've sent them from that address. Your public key is not exposed when you CREATE a wallet, and that's the bit of info a quantum computer would need to crack the private key. In addition, Electrum uses AES to encrypt your wallet. At this this AES is considered quantum resistant due to the impracticality of a quantum attack.

Regulation S applies to entity conducting the offering, not the person buying it. The burden is on them to comply. If they ignored this regulation and sold to someone they knew was a US citizen, the SEC could take an enforcement action against them. This can lead to their funds being seized, their founders arrested, and all kinds of other bad things for them. 
In general, this would mean they'd lose key resources which would make most entities or projects fail.

The challenges aren't that different from other non-traditional investments:
**Settlement** - Many new crypto investors want their coins now, but the friction between EFT (legacy financial tech) and crypto's irreversible transactions means there are long lag times
**Meaningful Metrics for Analysis** - When looking at equities, real estate, or commodities, there are indicators investors can use to gauge price direction. If its a cold winter, natural gas prices might rise. There is little of these indicators for cryptocurrency, so price movements are all highly speculative.   
**Uncertain Regulation** - In many countries there are questions about the regulation of crypto investing 
**Average Knowledge of Investors** - Many crypto investors are younger, newer investors who react differently than traditional investors. This can cause wild, irrational, and unpredictable behaviors in prices.

At the end of the day, unless you're getting paid in crypto, you need to transfer your fiat into a coin. By far the easiest coin to convert into is Bitcoin - there's a wide variety of exchanges to support this.
A few years ago, Bitcoin was the only crypto you could easily buy with fiat. If you wanted alts, you exchanged your bitcoin for the alt. 
That paradigm is slightly shifted as exchanges have grown and allow trading from fiat to alts directly, but for the most part, the legacy is intact.

A replay attack is the first one - where someone replays the script you use to send coins (with the signature.) 
Here's an example. Let's say you send coins from address 1 to address 2. Your wallet uses your private key to sign that transaction, and the network can verify that. 
If a chain without replay protection existed, someone could broadcast your same transaction on their chain, and, since the rules are the same, your coins move from address 1 to address 2 on that chain also. 


It all depends - but given how easy it is to automate this, I wouldn't be surprised if people write code to read the transactions their node receives and replays them just because they can. 
Note - you can't change the receiving (or sending) addresses in a replay attack, otherwise the signature wouldn't be valid.

You want to retire in 6 years and you're investing all your spare money into BTC, which has netted you .5 at the moment. Assuming you've been doing this for 5 months, that's .1 a month. 
In 6 years, at that rate, you'll have 7.2 bitcoin. In order to retire, you'd need about 25 times your expected annual spend. So if you spend $40,000 a year, that's $1m. 
I'm sorry to say your plan is totally unrealistic. The best way to retire is NOT to win the lottery (which your Bitcoin hopes are), and instead to focus on lowering your annual spend to absolute minimum.
All your extra money should go into various investments, of which Bitcoin should be a balance portion with other lower risk items. 
If you're serious about retiring, its just a matter of figuring our how cheap you can live while you're working and earning money, and then continue to live frugally when you're no longer working.

Regulation S is meant to protect investors from scams, by guaranteeing that you, as an investor, have all the information needed to make an educated investment. 
For example, if an ICO claims that they will disrupt some massive market and already have contracts with the government in order to do this, the SEC would ask them to prove those claims, or at least show data that indicates this is true. 
The vast majority of ICOs are scams, who's only goal is to enrich their creators by transferring money from non-sophisticated investors looking to get rich quick. This is exactly what was happening in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which is why Reg S was passed. 
Regulation S requires that securities (like tokens or coins) offered to a US citizen be registered with the SEC, so that they can verify the information being presented. They're serving as a trusted third party to the offering to make sure people don't get screwed by liars, cheats, frauds, or scam artists.

For Bitcoin to grow, it needs to be able to process more transactions. The software currently has 1MB limit to the size of a block - this means every 10 minutes, there is a finite amount of transactions that can fit into that 1MB.
SegWit solves this by taking part of the data in a block and moving it to a part of the transaction that isn't counted in the 1MB limit. The data is still there and the transaction is still secure, it is just "segregated" into a separate area. The nice part of this is that it used code already in the client, so users didn't have to download and install a different version of Bitcoin for it to work.
SegWit 2X is a desire to have SegWit AND double the size of the limit from 1MB to 2MB. If this happened, people would have to download a new version of the software, since the old version wouldn't know what to do with the new 2MB blocks.  This would lead to two valid versions of Bitcoin - called a hard fork. It means that some people could still run the previous version (with the 1MB blocks), and the new version, with the 2MB blocks. 
Because its all based on the same code, people are asking for a feature called "Replay Protection". Transactions are secured by a digital signature, that verifies one address has the private keys and authorized a transfer to a specific address. If you have two versions of the software that use the same rules, same addresses, same signature mechanism, you could basically copy a transaction from one chain and "replay" it on another. This means that you'd lose coins on one chain that you spent on the other. Note that this attack doesn't let someone spend your coins, it just means you don't have access to them.
As of now, the 2X version doesn't have any plan for replay protection.

Normal currency is NOT going anywhere, but it is losing value relative to things that have scarcity. You mentioned gold in one reply - bitcoin is used as a store of value, just like gold.

You don't invest in blockchain technology, you invest in solutions based on it.
Other cryptocoins are NOT investing in blockchain - they're mostly derivative works based on the same solution Bitcoin already has - a trust less currency and value exchange. Bitcoin has a pretty good solution to that problem and has high adoption, so any alt that does that is pretty limited.
There are some cases where there's efforts around smart contracts - things like Ethereum or Ripple - but you should look at them based on who they're competing with. Ethereum has a platform for trustless computing, competing with companies like Google and Amazon who also run cloud servers. Does the fact that its trustless make it worth the extra costs to run the network? That'd be up to you to analyze. 
Blockchains are big distributed databases - so look at who is disrupting companies that provide trust services. DTCC, who clears almost all equities trades in the US, for example. Who is targeting that market with a blockchain? How about title companies - again, they just run a database - is there a solution catching on that disrupts them?
Find those companies and that'll be where to put your money in - but most likely that'll be your local fiat and investing into traditional stock ownership, not buying alt coins.

You should get around 200 ASIC chips, 4 circuit boards, 9 PCIe molex adaptors, lots of solder, and probably 20 or so voltage regulators. Arrange them across 3 or so blades with enough space between them, wiring them in serial. Add in the right voltage adaptors to make sure each row of chips gets around 10 watts per chip. Don't forget plenty of thermal paste and heat sinks for each chip!
You then want to wire each board to a controller. The controller will have your ethernet and mining firmware. If you got the right chips, you should be getting around 14 th/s.

You cant mine Bitcoin directly with GPUs anymore. If you wanted to mine 1 coin a week, you'd need to be able to produce 700 TH/s of hashrate at current difficulty.
That'd mean buying 51 Antminer S9s, which would cost you around $61,200. In addition, those would all need power supplies (assume another $5,000) and power (76.5kw which would be around $1,500 per week at 12c per KwH).
So the cheapest would be around $68,000. 
A Pi Zero has about a 1 Ghz process and low memory, so you'd get around 0.5 mh/s. So get to your 700 TH, you'd need around 14 million of them.

Let's say you have 2 coins at address 1234XYZ before august 1.
The chain forks, once at block X (BCC), once at block Z (BTCg). 
So you have three different coins with the same history, on three blockchains.
In each, your address, 1234XYZ, has a balance of 2. 
You decide to move your Bitcoin in the main chain to a new address, 12345XYZ. So you open your wallet, and send the coins. 
You still have three different blockchains, but on the main one (bitcoin), you have 2 coins at 12345XYZ, and the others you have 2 coins at 1234XYZ.
You don't really have 6 coins though - you have 2 on each of the three chains. The chains don't talk to each other directly, so its as if you have completely separate coins, just at the same address.

I know for me, I've traded plenty of Bitcoin over the years. If I had bought more, I'd probably of sold it. The truth is that I was just really bad with money when I was younger, and didn't have discipline.
Because of that, I was always behind - maxed out credit cards, living paycheck to paycheck, all of that. There's no way I'd of held onto the coins until now.
Now that I'm older, wiser, and more financially secure, I can actually buy and hold coins and not worry about the money. 
Without that stability, I would probably sell the small amount I have when the next emergency, fun trip, or big purchase comes up.

Bitcoin kept growing in value, and the government was increasingly called to do something about it. Under the guise of protecting consumers from scams, they banned banks from exchanging dollars for it. Other governments move with the US on this, driving Bitcoin exchanges underground. 
With the inability to pay their power bills, miners and developers work together to create a proof of work that can be mined cheaply, and has built in exchange capabilities. This leads to the new coin spreading rapidly, especially as governments keep printing money and devaluing their currency.
With the increased automation, there are fewer jobs and defaults on loans grow.
Finally, the banks, over leveraged and unable to continue to be propped up by the government, fail. This leads to the widespread adoption of the new currency, with a large portion of global citizens getting their income from mining of it, and merchants using it to sell their goods. 
Bitcoin started it all, of course, and is often referenced in legends and stories of yesterday.

Coinbase will take your USD, and sell you some amount of Bitcoin. 
In your case, you bought $50 worth of Bitcoin, at a price of $2,500 per BTC, so you have around .02 BTC. 
You then can move that Bitcoin to another wallet (off coinbase), or leave it on Coinbase. If you move it off Coinbase, you have to move it back to them in order to sell it. 
You could sell it on another exchange as well - Gemini, Kraken, Bitstamp, and many others. You could send your coin to them and sell it on their system for the price they're offering.

No. Mining is basically brute forcing a hash. You take a few known items and hash them with a changing item (a nonce) until you find a hash that has the right characteristic. This is a good simulator of what's happening: 


The work can be distributed, which is what mining pools do. They essentially farm out ranges of times, nonces and merkle roots to try and find the right hash. When a miner exhausts the range, they get more work. When a new block is found, the miner resets.
You can look at the source code of a pool server here: 


You'd need to have a feed of currency prices, a miner that could switch proof of work algorithms, and a server that could coordinate the work and know how to submit proof of work for each different algorithm. 


Its a function of the difficulty of the proof of work algorithm. If its a popular coin, it could be infinite time - for example, if you had 1000 networked PCs mining Bitcoin, the odds are they'd never find a block. If its a system with a lower difficulty, your odds are much better.

If I were doing this, I would use the BitcoinD RPC API.
My DB schema would be simple, really just 2 tables:
tblBlocks and tblTransactions 
From there, I'd call the JSON RPC for GetBlock which includes all the transactions in a block, and write these to my block table. 
You can then iterate through those with GetTransaction which will give you all the TX details, and write these to my transaction table. 
You'd have to loop from block 1 to the current block (which you can get using GetBlockCount), but then you just need to query your transaction table to get the balance of an address. 
Your BitcoinD has to have the txindex set to 1, to tell it to look at transactions that it didn't relay or don't involved your wallet.

if the software client that has created the new wallet.dat never see's the Internet or the rest of the network, how will the rest of the network know that the new address exists ? and how can the network guard against duplicate addresses ?
It doesn't work that way. Every bitcoin address that will ever exist already exists! 
There is no registration of the address - the only thing that proves you own the address is the private key. The private key and the public key are mathematically linked, and your address is derived from the public key. 
The odds of creating a duplicate address are astronomically small - like finding two exactly identical grains of sand on a beach small.  
To add to this, every possible Bitcoin private key could be generated, and the person doing that would have complete control over people's funds. However, the sheer magnitude of this makes it impossible - you'd need more storage space than there are atoms in the universe. 
Bitcoin elegantly works by using these unimaginably large numbers.

You have a database on your computer called the blockchain. Bitcoin reads that database, which has addresses and balances. Someone copies that database, and uses it for their altcoin. 
Bitcoin adds to its database going forward, the altcoin adds to its database going forward. Nothing changes for Bitcoin, but if you use the altcoin, you have addresses in their database with the balances that you had in the Bitcoin database at the time of the copy (aka the fork.)
So if you had .0232 BTC when the copy happened, you still have that .0232 BTC in the Bitcoin database. You also have .0232 of the altcoin in their database.

While Bitcoin has been a rapid appreciation of value, with a time machine you could gain way more than the tiny market cap of Bitcoin. 
First, you could go back in time and get a bunch of gold by either stealing it or demanding people pay it by offering services that don't exist yet, like fire companies. 
You could, for example, buy Tesla's patents and keep the royalties he had for every kilowatt of energy that's produced in the country. 
You can take that money and create Standard Oil, investing money from there into cars, transportation/planes, and telecommunications, and then computers, and then mobile devices. 
You'd easily amass the greatest fortune in history, and you could silently mine away at the early blockchain, or create Bitcoin yourself.

First, understand that a transaction is what moves coins from one address to another. This transaction is basically a bunch of text instructions (ELI5 version anyway) that says "Move X coins to address 1 from address 2. Here is the signature of address2 to prove I own them." 
If two systems have the same blockchains and same rules (because one forked from the other, for example), then its possible for some to copy the text from one blockchain, and transmit it on the other, which would be a valid transaction. 
So, a replay is when you send your coins somewhere on chain 1, and then someone copies that transaction and "replays" it on chain 2 (which has the same rules and addresses), and your coins move there too. (Note, the addresses can't change, so your coins would still move to the same place.)
Replay protection is a way to prevent this that is coded into the system.

Bitcoin is one use case of Blockchain technology (trustless value exchange and payments.) 
In the future, more use cases for it could also come out, but Bitcoin remains the most widely use blockchain application. 
Ethereum is another example of a use for blockchain technology (using it for distributed computing), but to me it remains to be seen if it'll gain more mainstream adaptation vs. other distributed computing/cloud platforms. 
There's lots of other potential uses, from title insurance to equities ownership. Basically anything that uses a database today could also use a blockchain, especially if today there are central providers who's only value add is working as a trusted third party.

You should only buy mining equipment directly from the maker. Otherwise, you're out of luck when/if something breaks. 
There are three main makers today - bitmain (shop.bitmain.com), canaan (canaan.io but you have to buy in the US from their US distributor), and eBit (miner.ebang.com.cn)
Buying a miner today isn't hard, you just have to deal with quirks not usually there in most ecommerce.
* Bitmain sells units months in advance. They're currently only accepting Bitcoin Cash for their units. When you do a get a unit, it could've been running for months in one of their warehouses, and if something breaks, you have to ship the whole thing back to china. An RMA can take months.
* Canaan (through their US distributor, minerwarez) is often out of stock. 
* eBit is complex to buy, requiring you to pay with wire transfer and then chat on Skype with their staff to get your order setup 
In addition, mining requires a space that you can ideally run 220v power to, deal with thousands of BTU of heat, and loud noise from the fans. You'll also need good airflow and ventilation but most of all cheap power.

2X or not, if hash power leaves, the difficulty will take time to adjust. 
Let's say in a fictional scenario China bans crypto mining - roughly 40% of the hash rate would go away. That means that blocks would be much slower, until the next difficulty retarget. That happens every 2016 blocks, but it can fall at max by a factor of 4. It would take several periods of 2016 blocks to get to the right difficulty if the hash power left. 
However, the chain lives on - eventually the difficulty would adjust. Remember that Bitcoin ran with 99.99% less hashing power just fine.

When ordering from Bitmain, a few things you should be cautious about:
* They rarely ship on time. "November" covers from 11/10 to 11/30 - it could ship anytime in that range, or maybe the next month
* The reliability on the S9's newer batches are very bad. You'll have to send your machine back to them to for repair, meaning it won't be mining, and the ROI will be 0 for it at that time 
* Difficulty will increase a lot over the next few months as all the S9s and A741s ordered during the last ATH come online - it went up 20% last time and could go up 10% more
* They run their miners for weeks (or months) to "test" them - basically you subsidize their operations while they use the machine you paid for to mine for them

That's not my point at all. Bitcoin works on blockchain, just like HTTP works over TCP(over IP). 
The point of TCP/IP, for example, isn't to enable websites - but engineers created the Web over it because it met the needs they had. 
Similarly, a blockchain could be the underlying technology behind many other use cases. I named one, equity settlements. Satoshi created another, currency/value exchange. Ethereum uses a blockchain for cloud computing, Storj uses them for distributed storage, Namecoin uses them for DNS. 
My point is that the underlying technology (blockchain) can be separated from Bitcoin - so you could like that technology, if you don't like Bitcoin. You could find use cases that give users great benefits that have nothing to do with Bitcoin.

Why would crypto make that go away? Credit cards and checks didn't make the need for currency to go away.
Companies who run exchanges will always charge fees - your ATM is just like coinbase, a way to change your ledger balance into fiat.
The only way crypto will make ATM fees go away would be if it completely displaced all cash, which isn't a likely scenario. 
On the other hand, there's plenty of financial institutions that will pay your ATM fee for you - Ally, or Schwab, for example.

There's plenty of scams, but they are not unique to bitcoin. Bitcoin is just to scam people because they either don't understand how it works, or they have FOMO and do stupid things.
In general:
* If it sounds too good to be true, it is 
* Don't send your coins off to an untrusted source 
* Use escrow when dealing with untrusted sources (or reversible payments, which bitcoin is not)
* Don't install software, firmware, or apps unless you understand what they are - typically this means verifying the source code

This is the reason you'd of sold when you DID make a little money, on any of the run ups. $200 was all you had, and once that became $500, or $1000, or $2000 - it'd of been too hard to not sell it unless that amount of money wouldn't really impact your life.

No, because quantum computing barely exists and there isn't any general use quantum equivalent of a processor. 
If there were, Bitcoin could move from ECC to a more quantum resistant key generation mechanism. 
Additionally, SHA256 and RIPEMD are both one way hashing functions, which are quantum resistant. That means that your coins in storage are safe unless you reused an address, something that hasn't ever been recommended. 
In addition, that means mining is quantum resistant.

You can extract the private keys using pywallet and import those into another client.
Use pywallet's dump wallet to get the private keys. Once you have those, in core, you can import the keys from the console using importprivkey.
In electrum, you need to have a wallet that's not an HD one (ie: no seed), and you can import the keys there. You can also sweep the keys into an HD wallet.

If software licensing is centralized (ie: Microsoft allocates the license), I don't see why a blockchain would help them at all. You're trusting the software company to authenticate and store the license, so a trustless system doesn't entirely make sense.

To be precise, its a RIPEMD hash of a SHA-256 hash which has also been hashed several times prior in Base58.
You'd have to unwind or brute force multiple one way, quantum resistant hashing functions. You'd need to unwind steps 9-1 from:

ECC (part of address generation that generates your keypair) is susceptible to quantum attacks, but other parts of address generation (like SHA256) are not. 
This means that your address could be generated safely, but if you move coins there, you expose your public key, and in theory you could derive the private key from that with a quantum computer. 
If a real world quantum computer came along (they're mostly theoretical at this point), Bitcoin would have to switch from ECC to something more quantum resistant, like elliptical isogenies.

Sure it could - but you'd need to find a way to infect them. 
For example, if there was some sort of vulnerability in the underlying controller software, you could inject the worm into a mining machine. You'd need some way for that machine to infect others, but in theory it could be done.

It doesn't really work that way. Bitcoin could (and did) work with 99% less hashing power. 
Confirmation times are a function of block difficulty and transactions included in blocks. If hash power leaves, over time, the difficulty will adjust downwards. However, this will take a while as the difficulty retargeting is 2016 blocks, but it'll never drop by more than a factor of 4 - so it could take a while if hash rate leaves.

You'd need around 10 exahash of hash power. 
Let's say our attacker had their own ASIC capable of similar performance to the BM1387 chip in the S9, which has 189 chips that give 0.098 J/GHs for a total of 14,000 GH/s (or 74 GH/s per chip)
1 exahah = 1000000000 gigahashes, or  13,513,513 chips. You'd need 10 times that  - 135,135,130 chips.
Let's assume each chip costs $5 - that'd be $675,675,650 in chips alone. You'd also need the circuit boards and power supplies to run them. Let's round to an even $700,000,000 in hardware costs, even though that's probably low. 
You then need the power to run this - an S9, with its 189 chips, takes around 1.5kw. If we use our 135 million chips above, we get to 1,072,501kw - or 1,072 megawatts/1 gigawatt. 
The Hoover Dam produces 2 gigawatts of power a day, so it'd take roughly half the capacity of the daily output of one of the largest power sources in the US. 
All that power costs a lot - hydro costs around $63.9 per megawatt (and that's cheap), whereas nuclear costs around $96. (source:  
So we're looking at $102,912 of power costs per day, ish. Now you still aren't guaranteed to mine all blocks, but your attack will cost at least $700 million upfront and a couple hundred thousand in bulk power per day.

Pretty straight forward:
1) Form LLC in your state
2) Open bank account in name of LLC
3) Wire $100k into LLC bank account
4) Sign up on exchange (Coinbase, Gemini, whatever) as LLC, 
providing documentation to prove it
5) Wire $100k from LLC to exchange 
6) Buy 
You'll need to pay taxes on the LLC formation (franchise fee for your state), plus whatever wire fees for the wires. In addition, he should talk to his CPA about LLC ongoing reporting (if any.) 
Depending on how you structure the LLC, he'll be bottleneck unless he appoints you an officer. That gives you the authority to manage the LLC's finances and do things like open a bank account or open a Coinbase account.

The risk of using Coinbase:
* They will be hacked somehow and have the bitcoins in their wallets transferred out
* Coinbase refuses to let you withdraw your coins 
* Coinbase refuses to let you withdraw/transfer US Dollars
I'd say these risks are extremely unlikely to manifest, and they're risks with just about any financial company.
In terms of remaining anonymous, you can just transfer your coins from coinbase into a wallet you control. You can even withdraw to multiple addresses in the same wallet, or just keep moving your coins to new wallets. The only time the coins are associated with who you are is when they're in Coinbase, or if you publicize you own a particular address.
