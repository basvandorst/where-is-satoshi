@_date: 2018-08-21 20:34:36
Funny. Im crying
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:36:51

@_date: 2018-08-22 21:36:02
It won't get approved. It is not that easy. And we should not care.

Do they have offices? For that sum, I would go there and god knows what I would do to them.
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:02:18
Oh, it is said do not trade more than 0.5 BTC in an exchange right? You are an idiot.
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:31:39
If I had 1200 btc and they blocked my account I would fly the next day to their offices and speak with them in person.

How much do you get fucked a day because you use the world fuck too much.

This shows that even conpanies related to cryptocurrency collect out data.
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:30:28
Change bank. I live in Eastern Europe and I found only one bank which allowed me to do crypto-related transfers.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:42:44
Well, I do not believe you.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:56:29
