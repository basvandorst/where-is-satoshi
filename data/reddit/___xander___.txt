I don't think you have a clue what you're talking about because you feel your belief is so inherently correct that you won't even consider the possibility that it's not. 
This is an issue that has been debated for centuries by some of the greatest minds to grace the planet. 
The notion that mathematics is an intrinsic aspect of our universe is still heavily contested. No one is denying the applicability of mathematics to the real world (a distinction I'm sure you're struggling to grasp). 
However to outright claim with certainty that maths is / was always an independent feature of reality prior to humans application of mathematics is a wild assumption. 
Do some reading, probably start with some trash 5 minute YouTube videos the on the subject since I doubt you could get 5 pages deep into any serious literature.

If I lone you 5 bucks and you lone another person 5 bucks, but that person also happens to owe me 5 bucks. Well you’ve got yourself a situation where the sum total of our collective debts is -15 dollars. Doesn’t mean the world will crumble
