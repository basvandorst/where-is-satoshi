have 1 euro on me, bitcoin-traveler! @_date: 2015-07-01 08:45:48
Instead of trying to convert your precious Euros (cash ones, not the ones in the bank, they are useless now) to BTC, maybe you can try to sell some goods for BTC? I for one would be willing to buy some nice olive oil (preferably organic) for BTC. Or is shipping goods abroad prohibited too?

That's a challenge, but not impossible...
The price would depend on the effort required to get some.
I'll look around if I can find some !

Well, I don't believe they're scammers. I tried to order something from them last week, paid using PayPal, and they have refunded because they were sold out at the moment. They don't do preorders.
I just wanted to try again today, but now their PayPal account seems blocked. Went to eBay instead then...

I think the Blockchain app ( will do that.

Only if you start digging up your front yard. In the back, it shouldn't be a problem ;)

Too bad I only read this after returning home from Barcelona yesterday. Otherwise I would have certainly checked this out!
If only I had 10.000 BTC!!

Hey, BlackLilac, it seems that 2asic.com is down... What's wrong ?

As a Belgian resident, I could send you real Belgian Beer for BTC !
Just send me a message which beer you like, and I'll see what I can do.
