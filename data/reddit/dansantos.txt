Well slowly but surely they've required more information of people signing up. When I first got CB, all I needed was an email and password. Now they want your phone number and require you to accept them running credit checks (I don't remember when this happened, but I can go into T&amp;C and check).

I know. I was being sarcastic. I am a big advocate of decentralization of Bitcoin, hence my hesitation with adopting use of 3rd parties like Coinbase and the like. Bitcoin is about giving the power of money back to the people.

Well average people haven't had this much control over their money since...I really don't know. A long time. Or ever! I'd actually agree and say Bitcoin has grown enough traction for banks to be pissed enough to start their own blockchain. Talk about disruptive innovation! If this keeps up, I'd say banks will be fighting to stay relevant, much like brick-and-mortar stores since the advent of Amazon and Ebay.
People didn't trust banks to begin with, and now, thanks to social media's coverage, the one's who are being crapped on (lower/middle classes) are taking closer notice.
I hope we see more things like the housing bubble and corrupt bankers so everyone losses faith in a flawed system so they can depend on a trustless system.
Viva la Bitcoin!

So essentially, BTC/blockchain will carry fiat to other users? It's like the opposite of Xapo or Shift Visa, which uses fiat/Visa to carry BTC, right?
Also, please promise us this will allow us to send Bitcoin, because the site is honestly very unclear about it.

Coinbase is effectively acting as a traditional bank. It's not really how Bitcoin is *supposed* to work, but if it lets me use crypto instead of fiat, I'll take it for now. I believe if Bitcoin is being spent more often, because its a transactional currency, the value ought to increase, no?
Also, Coin card *does* kinda suck. Switching to Plastc.

@_date: 2014-04-08 04:09:55
I always find it interesting when people use the argument that BTC fluctuates so much, that it's not worth using it over USD. However, have you ever looked at an international exchange rate ticker? Even USD fluctuate in value (albeit, not as hard and fast as BTC, but we have the stock market for that). We just don't feel it because we feel the fishbowl. Everything we buy/sell is USD, even though the *value* of our currency is constantly changing.

I do like this toothbrush, and the fact there is an inexpensive subscription. However, what would set you apart from the many other bamboo toothbrushes/boar's hair natural bristles? 
Check out [licorice root]( I don't think it's been done before on a bamboo handle. There's one plastic tooth brush that uses the frayed root as bristles (which of course, I can't find online, as hard as I try). The root has antibacterial properties that's known to keep gums healthy and even cure cavities. They're also not as abbrasive as nylon, which scuff teeth and even wear enamel over the years.
Edit: by the way, [Bogobrush]( claims [nylon *is* biodegradable]( but after like, 50 years. So there's that.

It's a cool idea! Besides the obvious problems mentioned, my concern is where will this be stored? Like, it's locale? Will you host it? Or rent a server? 
What if you sort of made a side-chain, so everyone who participated would 'host' the site? This would give the Bitcoin community a web space that's true to it's P2P decentralized ideals.

Well that depends on if it's a hard or soft hit. If I apply for a loan, it probably won't hurt my credit score, but may decrease my chance of getting a loan somewhere else. Creditors can see who else is looking at your history. If Bank A sees Bank B declining me, they're likely to follow suit.
However, if I don't pay my bill, that's a hard hit, and drops my credit score. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 06:52:37

That's not entirely true, especially if you have decedents who were natives from the country you're trying to migrate to. Many Scandinavian countries will let you live there on a visa for school or whatever, and after some time you can take an exam to become a citizen. 
Also, you don't need citizenship in order to reside in a country. Actually, i can imagine the US is even more difficult to move into because of all the bureaucracy that doesn't necessarily exist in other countries.

I can't imagine a bitcoin fee being greater than that of the 3% Square requires and 1.51% + $0.10 Visa requires, along with all the other fees banks charge you even to move your own money from a savings to a checking.

I was the general public until 2013. As were a lot of people around the world.

No one's talking about the Mycelium card or the many merchants who accept bitcoin all over the Internet. Once the Mycelium network is implemented, you can pay in BTC to a merchant who wants USD via tokens. Same with Plutus, I believe. OpenBazaar has plenty of vendors who sell clothes and other useful items for BTC. Heck, there's always Craigslist, too.

That's crazy. In the US, credit reports do affect your standing with utility companies, but legally, it's very difficult to turn off someone's power or heat. I imagine being in Australia, you have some forms of social services who can assist while you're waiting out this Equifax nonsense.

I asked the alternative form the teller, and she said it was simply to have my card declined, without a fee. The "privilege" is sparing the embarrassment of a declined card.
