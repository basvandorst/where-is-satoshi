Yes. You're right. What I meant with my question is precisely that. What gives an employer the right to decide how an employee should invest their hard earned money? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:10:21
Is that even legal ?

Many people got greedy and invested more money they could afford to lose. Besides, they ignored all indications that showed the the writing was on the wall for Mt. Gox.

there you go your 0.001 BTC back: 1 mBTC the standard fee is 0.1 mBTC, not 1 mBTC ;-). 
If you want to pay extra fees , go to your local bank and use fiat. No need to do that in Bitcoin.

Why did Satoshi design Bitcoin to have 21 milion units ? Not that I have anything against this number, but for such a ellegant project, you would expect a rounder number : 50,100...

I have a trezor wallet. If I ever lost it, would I not be able to recover my bitcoins until I get a new one and use the seed with it? 
We have no certainty that satoshilabs are going to be around forever. Perhaps trezors wallets become unavailable in the future... so how do the trezors user protect themselves from the scenario in which they lose their wallets and they don't have access to another one ?
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:18:07
After Mt.Gox affair, it is obvious that a decentralized exchanged is needed more than ever.

Rather that exporting the private key of one or several of the addresses of your electrum wallet, you would be probably better off if you back up the seed instead. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:10:06
Thanks but no thanks. Most of the people that lost on GOX would probably lose again any donations we give them.
If I wish to donate to someone, I would rather do it to someone who does not seem to be a retard.
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:46:50
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but can you recover your bitcoins with just the seed + password + electrum ? I was under the impression that you needed the physical device, a new  trezor wallet, to use the seed  to recover the bitcoins ?

Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the norm in the Spanish Bitcoin subreddit: , where it is mostly Spaniards participating.

It's a meme originating from bitcointalk.org. Someone got drunk and opened a thread in the speculation section with the title: I AM HODLING! People liked it and you can imagine the rest.

I do.  he's speaking Spanish with Andalusian accent (southern Spain) and he is telling a stupid story when he once lost a big pan at the beach. The tide came up and swallowed the pan only to appear later  in some rocks at the shore. He needed it to cook a Paella (typical Spanish dish).
This guy was quite popular in Spanish tv a few years ago. His name: el Risitas. ("Chuckles").

Hi, 
I use bitcoin-qt and everytime I open it the "verifying blocks" stage is taking longer and longer. I read that I could use the command -checkblocks = 10   (or another small number) to reduce the time on that wait. But I am sure there are some drawbacks or risks on doing that. Could you please tell me what are those ?
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:19:30

Newcomers need to do their due diligence before embarking on this venture. This person was using Coinbase as a wallet which is something that has been widely discouraged. Now that he's been mugged, he tries to put on the blame  on Coinbase and even goes as far as demanding more "paternalistic" security measures. 
This is a bit like crashing the car because you are driving under the influence and then blame the car manufacturers for not making cars that won't start up if the driver seems to be drunk.
Driving 101: you don't drink and drive.
Bitcoin 101: you only own the bitcoins if you own the private keys.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:50:20
ehh...not really.
Look at the end of the article , he comes up with a list of security measures that Coinbase should implement. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:26:01
Bitcoin is build upon the idea that you should not trust no one in order to send a payment. If you have a balance in Coinbase, you are trusting they hold their end of the bargain ie: they will send the bitcoins to the address you provide when you request it. 
Only if you have the private keys you can send a transaction without relying in nobody else. For the average user to hold your own private keys equals to store your bitcoins in your own wallet.

He didn't lose $8k worth of Bitcoin. 
He lost $8k worth of BitcoinIOUs.
As we have said time and time again: if you do not own the private keys, you do not own the bitcoins. 
Some people only learn through the hard way. This is one example. There will be more.
I am sure he will not make the same mistake again.
