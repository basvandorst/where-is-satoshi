Last week FED cuts rates at market highs with a whole month of inflationary data incoming and trump vetoing the ban on sales of weapons to saudi Arabia 
Today USA says China is a currency manipulator
BTC is a company made up of everyone that uses BTC

Anyone want to buy the option to buy my house for USD at the tax assessed value? I will sell that option for the price of the current debt on it +46% of the debt all in bitcoin?  Expires Dec 24th.

SHA is a really good problem to solve zeros for precisely because it is used in the financial industry. I think I know a better hash problem to look for zeros in and I’m not too fond of the way the bitcoin protocol does its networking but after I finish mine I’ll exchange it for btc too, probably at a BTCUSD price of saving mcafees dick

When the market is down 0.25% on the year excluding inflation, and bitcoin is up 30% on the year even after dropping 4% today, who in their right mind would buy the market today and sell bitcoin today?
The kind of people that ban me from public speaking platforms and sell weapons and usa companies to pedophile worshipping saudis that had the FED cut rates at all time highs and let jeffery Epstein get suicided

If the FED doesn’t choose bitcoin as its real-time payment mechanism then what the hell kind of phd mathematicians are working there?
