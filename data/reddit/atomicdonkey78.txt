In a free market there is competition. WU operates with special permission from government regulators, competitors cannot easily participate in the international remittance business because they are not granted permission. So WU has enjoyed a lack of competition and charged poor people for the privilege of doing business with them. It is not free market, it is rent seeking. Thankfully Bitcoin is disrupting this model.

"Maybe when its worth $1000 or more people will naturally begin to use different denominations but I don't think it should be forced." I'm not suggesting the use of force. If I could use force I would just have everyone call them atomicdonkeycoins. All I'm suggesting is that the bitcoin community which includes btc developers and entrepreneurs give this idea some serious consideration as it could really help open the doors to some very large untapped markets while increasing overall network effects and market demand which could dramatically raise the value of bitcoin, which would capitalize new bitcoin startups and services driving prices higher and potentially necessitating another 'Moving of the decimal place party'.

Hindsight is 20/20. People who dedicated their cpu cycles to mining (securing the network) did so with no promise, and very little chance of any financial return at all. In 12 months bitcoin could be worth $2000+ or zero or anything in between. The investment proposition that bitcoin offers today is very similar to the one it offered in 2009 in terms of risk versus return. ie. a small investment today could yield big returns tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 17:33:06
Governments and their alphabet agencies, with their absurd edicts are inherently corrupt, no argument there.

I love the potential for bitcoin remittances. One issue that has been discussed on other threads is the problem of sending bitcoins to regions with no market demand for bitcoins, necessitating potentially expensive bitcoin arbitrage via the legacy banking system. Proposed solution: Open 'Bitcoin General Stores' in regions with good remittance opportunities, to create a market demand for bitcoin. Stock everyday useful items at competitive prices. Then people might ask their expatriated family members to 'just send bitcoins'.
