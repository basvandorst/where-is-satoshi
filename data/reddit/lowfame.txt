So, your "real world" does not include all the millions of people that sit and program OSS in their free time?

Hmm, i'm not so sure about the last part. QR codes have a fairly good degree of error correction. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 08:04:08
What? I hope your are not decoding QR codes in your head..     
EDIT: By error correction i mean that even for low error correction QR codes, up to 7% of the QR code can be restored if lost. For high error correction QR codes that number is 30%.

I'm talking about the Avalon chips here, and even if the lead time on the chips is 10+ weeks (and lets not forget that the FPGA's would also have quite the lead time, as they are not currently in production), my bet would still be on those, my reason being (this is without having done any calculations) that they would break even around the same time, and after breaking even, the asics would make a greater profit.

You could try and get your hands on some of the avalon chips, if you are not afraid of DIY.   
There are a couple of groupbuy thread over at bitcointalk.org

You say they are about 6 weeks away. The Avalon chips are about 10 weeks away. The FPGA will deliver about 0.85 Mh/s/$, while the avalon chips will give you just under 3 Mh/s/$.    
I don't see this as a good investment, but you are free to do as you wish ;)

Wait and see..
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:22:02
At least tell us what type of hardware you are going to be running.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:13:43
Yeah, 10% of the yearly profit.

No, the point is that if you actually want to mine, don't buy from BFL. Not because of the lack of ROI, all mining equipment are in that state, it's because of the gamble you take. You don't know when you will recieve it. It could be anywhere from 2 weeks from now to never.

But wouldn't they actually need to be on [insert whatever name they may have for the official terrorist group list], before there actually was a problem? (And i have a suspicion they don't just put everyone on there)    
Or would donating to any criminal group be a problem? If that is the case then you would be in trouble whether or not they were the mafia.

No. The idealistick users are the ones who are not panic selling. They are the good guys in all of this.

At least you didn't lie.. But if you really want to do drugs, at least wait until you can get them on your own. And not living with your parents anymore.

But will these FPGA even have a chance to break even? My guess is no. As it stands now, they will break even in 10 months, in that time we could surely agree that the avalon chips have been out for quite some time, and as soon as they are out in the free (with a working design), these FPGA will be near obsolete.      
You should also consider price. These FPGA are around 1k, this will get you around 70 chips, if you put a little over 200$ aside for shipping and assembly. The FPGA will deliver 860 Mh/s, while your 70 chips will deliver 19.6 Gh/s (or 19600 Mh/s).    
While the avalon chips might be a long term  investment, as i see it, its the only sane investment.

These guys have put a lot of time in to uploading of this, without getting anything, i doubt they are the mafia. The mafia (as i recognized them) would be for the money, not to spread stuff for free.
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:04:43
Oh, i thought we were disagreeing. My mistake.
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:53:35
Why buy these when the Avalon chips are just around the corner?
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:01:36
But the difficulty will not stay the same. It will go up. And when all the new avalon chips hit the marked, these will take very long to break even.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:36:16
I have a feeling they already are
