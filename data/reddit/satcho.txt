This is a really good idea, it could work like applying a coupon code.

From the screenshots I think it needs more ads, one can still see some useful information

My first tip, thank you!

It is better than nothing. Think it also works in the general case, when you don't have enough bitcoins to cover the full bill. When I give bitcoins to my friends and family I am a bit more generous than 50 cents but probably not enough to buy whatever they may be buying. It would be great if they could use my present without having to buy more bitcoins.

Well, I agree with you that technology does not have a political link, as it is a tool. 
But this specific technology is used and advertised as an alternative currency to government's currency, how could that be more political?

I would show the three options with the associated increase or decrease in price with respect to the selected one. For example with bitcoin selected it shows +5usd next to the credit card option and selecting the credit card option displays -5usd next to bitcoin. That way nobody feels ripped off and the differences are still clear and well visible.

The main problem I could see when I tried bitcoind on my NAS was high memory consumption (more than 512 MB nowadays). I guess that is proportional to the size of the blockchain. The peercoin blockchain is much smaller and I guess they don't reach that amount of RAM.
