This is the best multisig tool for in vivo applications.  
The only thing I miss is the bitcoin address next to the public keys on the verify page.
Would it be hard to make this whole thing into a GreaseMonkey script or a browser addon?
It could  read the tx or the redeemscript from the webpage where the script was opened, then it'd show some info about the TX, and ask for a priv key and sign it. Or even maintain a HD wallet just for signing keys.

Technical explanation:

1.) Send the coins to a newly created address.
2.) Use  to create a new transaction:
- set nLockTime to the desired date ( will come in handy)
- "...payment to" should be one of your own addresses
- "Amount" should be all the coins and set the miners fee.
3.) Verify the transaction (paste it into the Verify tab) see if it looks ok.
4.) Save the transaction and keep it safe. It can be only broadcasted after the given date (using the broadcast tab for example). 
5.) Destroy the priv key for the FROM address (you created it in step 1.)
Now you don't have control over the funds in that address, but you have a signed timelocked transaction that will move the coins to one of your own addresses.

At the moment the easiest way to deal with multisig is  in my opinion.

A toolbox, preferably incorporated into a wallet. 
- Vanity addresses
- Blackhole Address
- Crack private keys - useful for damaged paper wallets (bruteforce/mask attack a couple of characters in WIF formats or Brainwallet, password list attack...)
- Create, verify, sign multisig transactions, nlocktime
- Pass data over with QR codes, voice, NFC, Bluetooth, etc
- Shamir's SS

It's a valid bitcoin address but no one has the private key for it so the coins sent there cannot be spent.
for example:
* 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE
Can be used in bitcoin treasure hunts, as a [proof of burn]( or to store some data publicly on the blockchain (although there are better methods for that ), and who knows what else...

Compared to all the other multisig tools this is the most intuitive and easiest to use, in my opinion.  
If you have suggestions I'm sure the dev would like to hear them.

Maybe give  a try?

Let's say you want to pass your coins to your son in case you are not available for 6 months.
You create a timelocked transaction that sends the coins from your address to your son's address, and give this tx to your son.
It can be broadcasted by anyone, cannot be modified (so it will always send the coins from your address to your son's) and can't be mined until the given time.
Your son will have to hold on to this tx.
If you are still alive, move your coins to a different address so the transaction held by sonny cannot spend it anymore, and create a new timelocked tx that can spend from this new address after 6 months.
