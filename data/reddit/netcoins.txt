Most of the stores are running it on a computer / PC at the checkout, although some also use tablets. 
It's a web app, so it'll run on any device with a browser.

Resurrecting an old thread here, but Netcoins' has officially launched in Canada (starting in a dozen Vancouver / BC area stores).

I thought the "Inside Man" episode with Morgan Spurlock on CNN was a good intro to Bitcoin that would be well suited to a short class (as opposed to showing a feature length documentary). 
One other tip would be to get students to download a Bitcoin wallet right away, and experiment with micro amounts (even if you give $0.01 to each student). Most newbies understand Bitcoin a lot quicker once they've used it first-hand, rather than just hearing someone talk about it.

Just coming across this a bit late - yes Netcoins can definitely help. As long as you have an Internet connection in the store, Netcoins "virtual" ATM can just run in a web browser. Happy to continue the discussion over email / phone:

Hi everyone, Michael Vogel here from Netcoins. 
We are super excited to be launching very soon - stay tuned for more details about how Netcoins works and local availability! 
Retailers and consumers can sign up for updates at goNetcoins.com

We have a major announcement coming soon for Canada...can't reveal it just yet, but stay tuned. 
Netcoins is actively deploying in Canada though - you can also suggest a location (or city) on the site: 
The great thing for retailers is there is no cost to deploy a "virtual" ATM, so Netcoins is able to offer Bitcoin ATM services in suburbs and smaller cities that previously wouldn't have been able to support a physical Bitcoin ATM machine.

US is coming very soon - right now we are accepting signups from US stores

Interestingly, Flexepin outlets (Esso etc) also accept credit card payments for the vouchers.

Promo for July - Netcoins' fees are 0%
Flexepin charges us a hefty fee to use their retail infrastructure, so we're actually selling at significantly below cost for July.

We're required to verify a Canadian phone number for first time orders (you'll get an SMS verification pin). Subsequent orders from the same email address won't ask you to re-verify your phone number.

Netcoins hasn't announced it yet (other than right now!), but we've set our fees to 0% until July 31. 
Merchants have a voucher fee, $1.49 - $7.95 (for higher denomination). If you want to buy for best value, then the $7.95 on a $250 voucher would be ~3%. 
Flexepin is definitely an experiment for us, so we welcome feedback. Outside of Flexepin, Netcoins still operates our flagship "virtual" ATMs running in a number of Canadian stores.
