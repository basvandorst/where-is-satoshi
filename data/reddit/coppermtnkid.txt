Ah ha! But they are independent countries! They all have their own legislature, executive and judicial branches! They all even have their own defense! The untied states is 50 separate counties that cooperate on certain issues, but not all.

What's coinbase Support? /s

I'm trying to convince my circle that this is possible. Obviously I know it's an unknown, but what are some things I could reference to make this argument. All I can tell about bit coin is 2 things : 1) never buy more than you can afford to lose and 2) no one knows anything about the next spike or drop.

Coinbase Support or mycelium? I have submitted with coinbase. One generic answer with suggested solutions that don't even match my problem. Certainly no human response.

You're referring to buying a dip. Which is a plausible suggestion, but as another user stated, if it was so easy, we'd all be millionaires. If you want to try it yourself, go ahead. You can try small amounts on coin base fairly easily.

is that way bro. What do you think we're all here for? What you're experiencing is FOMO. Fear of missing out.
We all hope and pray this becomes the defacto currency of the world. It's literally saving lives in places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela. Also, *if* this goes to the moon (6 or 7 figures/btc) and you're in on it now, we're all gonna have a substantial amount of wealth.
But maybe (insert c.k. Lewis.jpg) this thing crashes to nothing tonight. Who the fuck knows?
Rule 1) don't invest more than you're comfortable never seeing again
Rule 2) no one knows what the fuck this shit will do. Ever. Not now, not tomorrow. Hence the volitility = high risk, high reward
Rule 3) HODL
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:24:10
I would argue it's neither. There's 2 components here. 1, alot of people believe that this is a viable long term solution to fiat currency. Number 2, people are hoping to get rich. When  you see a dip, alot of that can be people selling off because it hit a price point people want to cash out at. When you see a small gain, its because it hit a lower price point that people want to buy in at. Again, this is totally unpredictable. Sure, whales can move the market, but the average person can't really.

True, but does this particular peice of anecdotal evidence worthless here? I'm not writing an apa essay. I'm just trying to prove a point that BTC us a phenomenon, and to dismiss it so quickly is short sighted.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:13:30
I bought in at 10.8k. But, I've been thinking about buying for ever. I really just picked a shitty time to buy in because I got super hyped and said fuck it. BUT! I didn't blow my whole wad, I mainly just bought to set up my wallet because I was expecting a post ATH dip. And im buying the dip baby.

10k/btc is pretty successful
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:38:44
Look man, I don't have any bitcoin but you're being pretty obtuse here. Sure it might crash. Matter of fact, I'd say it will, but there's no denying that it is the wave of the future. It'll have peaks and valleys and whatnot, but to totally ignore this phenomenon is short sighted as hell. In 20 years you're entire life has changed with the internet, now look where you are. What makes you think this isn't revolutionary?

I saw a video posted here a while back that someone said would change someone's mind that didn't believe in bitcoin? Anyone know what it was? I can't find it.
