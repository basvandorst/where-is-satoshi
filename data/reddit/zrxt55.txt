This man is a hero.

The weight constraint must keep the block size to 1MB for legacy nodes.

Hey thanks so much for that visual.  I finally got it.  If you want to see a dummy see the light, it's in this thread.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:19:32
I just can't see how they contain more transactions per 1MB block if they still send the same transactions to the legacy nodes and they can fit them in 1MB.  Are the segwit transactions smaller or something?  I am just not getting this.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:37:36
Hey, I finally understand with the help of everyone here.  Follow this thread if you want to see me finally get it.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:00:59
I'm still confused as hell. So do legacy nodes and Segwit nodes actually see different blocks? Each block is created by a miner and x amount of transactions are put in it. I can't see how legacy nodes and Segwit nodes can see different blocks therefore, the block size must still just be 1MB.

Oh god thank fuck!  Jesus hallelujah!  Hey man thanks a lot for spending the time with me to help me understand.  You're doing the Lords work.  Hell they should post this conversation somewhere so other idiots could follow.  
Thanks so much!!

By the way, I'm not trying to be political in any way.  I just want to understand.  Right now it's above my head.  Can you help me understand how this is more than 1MB of transactions or an actual increase in the block size.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:32:07
Sorry, I think I'm close to understanding.  Just bear with me.  I'm a dolt.  So this is correct?  
 
Bascially the segwit transactions with the witness data stripped out are much smaller than traditional transactions and therefore many more of those transactions can fit in 1MB?
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:51:21


This isn't true.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:28:14
Apparently not.  I thought so too but others have argued with me that's not the case.  
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:41:24
Technically total transactions in a block must still be able to fit into a legacy 1MB block with all Segwit transactions having their witness data removed.   
Since these transactions are smaller, more can fit in the block.  Do you know, if all the transactions were the smallest  possible Segwit transactions, how many could fit in that 1MB block?  Is it equal or comparable to 4MB of traditional transactions?
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:53:40
I'm talking about Segwit not Lightning.

Sure...we've been screwing them over for a long, long time and will continute to do so for Israel.  
  


I've been asking myself that same question about people like you for a long time.   


Sound familiar?
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:49:57
...hmm...maybe stop all the war mongering by Israel and it's puppet the US?  Of course we'll never do that as our country is owned by Israel and does what it wants every...single...time.  Anyone else looking forward to another round of all our politicians campaigning in Israel?  According to our Israeli owned media, the Russians control us.  You'd think politicians would be campaigning to them.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:03:12
This is getting there for me but I still don't see how blocks are larger than 1MB if the transactions they send to legacy nodes are just 1MB blocks.  Are they outright lying to legacy nodes or do transactions in each block still total to a maximum of 1MB?  
Edit:  Nevermind.  I finally saw the light.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:11:11
Right now, I don't think they ever even receive it.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:21:23
They strip out a lot of it for the legacy nodes.  This was explained above and by many others so I believe that's true now.  Legacy nodes get all the transactions but not all the witness data.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:15:44
Thanks a lot for the visual!  Can you explain how there are actually greater than 1MB blocks now?  It appears to me that we still have the same limit on total transactions in a block and the block is still actually limited to 1MB as that's all the legacy nodes can see.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:52:58
I think they just don't see segwit witness data.  They still see the transactions--I believe.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:09:01
I'm not trying to be poltical as I don't care one way or the other but this means that there are no more transactions possible than before.  There was effectively no block size increase that also increased total transaction capability.  Correct?  If this is incorrect, I just don't see how it's possible to have more transactions than before.    If it is possible and you understand how, help me understand how.

Maybe the segwit transactions are much smaller with the witness data stripped out?  Is that it?  So let's say you have all segwit transactions in a block then the legacy nodes could actually hold 2.5 to 4 times more of them than traditional transactions?
