DAMN.. if I had just waited 20 minutes. 
Seriously though, at what point will people start unplugging their miners?
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:13:45
It is!!

The resistance, led by John Connor, came back and prevented skynet from ever being built. You shouldn't even know that name.

Technically if you write an AI designed to kill all humans you could end war.

That would require me putting on clothes and leaving my house. I obviously haven't thought this through very well. I rescind my threat.

I was using it on cex.io before I switched pools. They had a customer service account you could email if your phone took a shit and you had the 2FA enabled.

I don't have an opinion one way or another on that.
I stopped using cex.io not because of the 2FA issue, but because I thought their commission fees were too high when there were plenty of pools out there WITHOUT commission fees.

Yup! That was pretty much what I said verbatim.

Honestly, that is up to us (Developers) to make wallet clients easy enough to use, but secure by default.

This. This attitude would be like making everyone take an IPv4 test before allowing them to have internet access installed at their house.
