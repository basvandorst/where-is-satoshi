He's definitely a hack, I don't think that was ever really in question. The issue is *despite* being a hack, should his first amendment rights as a US citizen not be protected? If your answer is that they shouldn't be protected, who then decides who qualifies as a "hack" and how is that justified?

And as we know, Banks always follow regulations...
But ok sure, regulations could simply mandate improvements as they did with FPS, etc., but as in any industry this creates potential barriers to competition and ensures that a select few banks will dominate. Consequently, these big banks are now in a position to not only buttfuck their clients with ease, but enforcing such regulations and imposing any sort of meaningful reprimand of undesirable behavior becomes potentially harmful to the entire economy. Who is really regulating whom at that point?
I think the main point is that Bitcoin requires no third party, removing any necessity for trust, and simply makes banks irrelevant.

I think the debate really just stems from a semantic disagreement. If we switch "intrinsic value" with something like "use value" or simply utility, I think we may come to a better consensus.

I would say the biggest advantage is that its efficiency is combined with impartiality. You can theoretically replace every service the entire financial sector offers with automated code to create a system that is faster, freer, and probably most importantly, incorruptible.

It's not his logic, it's how the network works. Your transaction will propagate the network almost instantly, and you can indeed initially have 2 transactions that contradict, either by accident or in an attempt to double-spend. Only one of these can be correct however, and once included in a block, any other instances claiming the same output are rejected.

Well the presumption is (and unfortunately there's no precedent, so I can't say with certainty) is that because bitcoin is limited, the derivatives so nonchalantly fucked around with to cause the crisis would have carried *actual* risk and would have negated the entire scenario. No "well just get bailed out" mentality because it would be impossible to do such. 2008 *was* a disaster, and it's a huge reason bitcoin looks way more appealing.

I'm curious, why do you want a single government entity controlling the value of the money *you* earn? I would presume for "backing" by said government, but this is a concept closer to coercion than it is to stability.

No arguments here, but we can't deny that this debacle will be constantly waved in our faces as an example of why regulation is "necessary." As the author put it:

Scarcity and utility creates demand. I will say Bitcoin's current demand is largely speculative, but this speculation is not exactly misplaced as its functions and potential are unprecedented and useful.

No doubt these are all extremely well-placed concerns and definitely the most reasonable overall criticism I've heard to be skeptical of mass adoption.
I'm definitely not as well-versed on the specific inner-workings of Bitcoin's network tech, but to play devil's advocate at a broad level, I think the element of game theory involved in network expansion is where confidence is placed in its predicted scalability. I'm sure you've taken this into account, so I'm wondering how, outside of say a huge security/protocol weakness, the structure of such incentive-driven network growth would potentially fumble to encourage a scenario such as miners leaving en masse? Also, though you're probably more concerned with the interim period between difficulties, wouldn't the overall response to such a situation be that more potential miners fill the positions left behind because of decreased competition?  
To me it seems like the whole system is a feedback loop of incentivized growth. Kind of like a mathematically grounded Moore's law if that makes sense. I think if anything kills bitcoin it'll probably be human-related, but I'm extremely intrigued that you find the tech side of things to be questionable and I'd love to know more.

I think you definitely hit the nail on the head regarding colored coins' function as a centralized layer over the decentralized Blockchain, and in this regard it does seem to cancel out the trustless nature that makes the Blockchain so innovative. 
I think your explanation of a prebuilt unified system really is the main focus, but I think the possible benefit that stems from this is that it removes any potential barriers to acquiring whatever the colored coin represents and puts everyone in the same playing field. It seems like in a way it decentralizes the trading platform of centralized assets...if that makes any sense.

I would say commodities are the *best* forms of money because regardless of trusting value they will have utility. Governments were limited with commodity-backed currency so moving to a free-floating fiat system was entirely to expand government's role and "pay" for things we actually can't afford (like wars). It's not difficult to see why trust will eventually implode as it almost did in 2008 unless some serious reform is taken. I think this is the real regression of money.

If you come from the perspective that constant, consistent consumer spending is necessary then incentivizing purchasing definitely makes sense. 
But how is this system efficient or sustainable in the long term? Why not encourage saving, sensible spending, and an overall mindset that discourages waste? It's a far cry from mainstream economic policies in place for sure, but I believe it can create a vastly more rational consumer, and has great potential for incentivizing progress over consumption.

Read that again, and then consider the possibility that maybe the "bitcoin community" that you "hate" so much is not the irrational one in this dispute.
I would genuinely be interested in hearing your defense of the government that you're very aggressively defending. From the standpoint of an objective observer, it would seem you're not so different than those aggressively defending Ulbricht, just simply on the other side. Please keep in mind though, we have the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments for due process and presumption of innocence, which is presumably where most people defending him here are coming from.
Take a step back, remove the vitriol, and attack the arguments instead of the people saying them. When you continue to use ad hominem and generalized attacks, your credibility is instantly lost, and is perhaps the reason people don't want to listen to what you're saying.

I like this. So let me attempt a rebuttal. 


I know you agree they should, but this doesn't discount these things as problems in our current system. I get your argument though: that this will prevent its widespread adoption. I think in this regard promotion of low transfer fees/no freezing of accounts (basically anything that banks suck balls at in regards to the individual) will be preferable to putting forth the technical economic aspects.


I don't know the specifics of spending trends, but I believe this is probably more so due to the fact that bitcoin is not accepted in most popular marketplaces, rather than it being deflationary. Could this not be an equally acceptable explanation for little spending?

It seems as though the most influential source to such a condition is actually another problem of money more so than the people. I think Bitcoin definitely has enormous potential to cripple such corruption if it was implemented into campaign finance and lobbying, becoming easily monitored on the blockchain through public campaign/governmental wallets.

How is taking the drug trade out of the streets a bad thing? It's going to happen regardless, so why not structure it as a competition through anonymous internet markets instead of through violence?
The whole "abstinence doesn't work so let's continue to teach/enforce it instead of informing ourselves to the negative consequences and ways to avoid them" policy doesn't really make any sense...
If the hits really did take place, it's indeed horrible and I don't think anyone is disputing this, but at least try to understand the idealistic 'greater good' perspective of all of his actions. Surely you like the economic freedom bitcoin provides and don't mean to generalize an entire community?

Do you not realize how insanely corrupt our government/corporate structure is and how money and greed grease its machinery? The Fed/treasury department might as well just be another wing of Goldman Sachs (Larry Summers, Henry Paulson). The US AG won't go after any of these people for their financial terrorism and you think that's acceptable? Pretty much anyone with any judicial idealism (Eliot Spitzer for example) will tell you otherwise, and why nothing is happening (hint: $$$).
If you don't think this is all about friends helping friends to collect insane amounts of wealth the rest of us couldn't even dream of, you haven't really cared enough to look at the situation. Ignorance is bliss I suppose.


Do you even know how Bitcoin works? It's coded to be as predictable as possible. *We're* the ones asserting a price on it as an exchange. If there was no unit of account, you'd be seeing things a lot differently. I'd love to know why predictable deflation from the supply side is not good for an economy. There is no precedent for such an economy, so please speculate away.


Stockholm syndrome at its finest. Or some trolling.
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:05:09
Exactly. I think it's a similar semantics argument when those opposing Bitcoin have issues with "backing," specifically from the state. All backing does is support the acceptance of a currency (usually in the form of paying taxes) which then translates to *trust*. But as we know, trust can evaporate regardless of a backing, because this trust is simply the effect of widespread coercion and not based in any particular utility or desire to use the currency, only the fact that we *have* to use it.
In my opinion, Bitcoin flips the entire concept of money the way it should have always been, where commodities like gold formerly filled the role, and uses technology to improve upon its ideals in every way. Among enhancing the already established traits of sound money (fungibility, portability, durability, and divisibility), by having its foundation built upon an open-source code, public ledger, and cryptographically-secure interaction with the protocol, I think Bitcoin simply leads those that choose to use it *directly* to the trust. And thus a "backing" or coersion is simply unnecessary to establish consistent demand.
