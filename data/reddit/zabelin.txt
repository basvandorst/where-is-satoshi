You can keep your coins on Mt.Gox if you like or download a software wallet like one at bitcoinarmory.com that has encryption.
To transfer bitcoin just copy/paste your destination address in the send bitcoins menu with the amount, the menus should be self explanatory.
Here is one of many sites that accepts bitcoins:

I think it makes more sense that basic programing needs to be taught in schools and at a young age. It's getting much harder for people to advance in todays world without knowing something about computers and technology
Out of all its features, Bitcoin's OSS nature is the biggest. It's hard to trust in any closed source system that you can't investigate.
People are just very angry at the banking industry as a whole and are willing to look for an exit/option when things go south. Personally I love playing by a completely different set of rules, knowing that my funds simply can't be seized or denied. It sucks to go without any money just because I travel to a new location and/or continent.

I suggest a password manager/password generator now. New password cracking software is now capable of combination attacks on GPUs with a 60-80% success.
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:36:39
On the topic of Password cracking this includes passphrases, here is two great artical from Ars Technica:
As complex as language can be, the number of combinations is very limited. If you can find it in a dictionary, on the web, keyboard combinations, letter substitution and large rainbow tables. Just about any password/passphrase that a human can think of can be cracked.
Today just about any computer system and website requires a password, the human mind can only keep track of so many. At the time of this writing I currently keeping track of 113 unique passwords. I know for a fact I will never remember all of them, I need a password database to keep track.
If you are pulling it out of your head, then its probably a terrible password.

It will not show on blockchain.info because it was never sent to them. I had to generate the signature with multibit and copy/paste to reddit in the comment.
I could just as easily say this (FBI sized coins: 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX) is my address but only the true owner can sign with the private key.
You can send bitcoins with messages attached within blockchain.info under "custom send", but like I send it will only show up for blockchain.info users and will not show up under the bitcoin blockchain or under anyones software wallet.

The easiest way is to sign a message with the same private key that generated the public address that you send the bitcoins to.
Here is a video from youtube that shows how to sign a message: 
Your wallet will only be able to sign if you have the same private key that was used to generate the public key. If the client refuses to sign then you do not have the private key.
Another way to find out is by looking into your wallet.dat file when its unencrypted and finding the correct private key.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:05:42
I don't see the point in doing this, security through obscurity is no security at all. Encryption is a much better solution if you want to keep your bitcoins safe.
You can use truecrypt to create a virtual drive of almost any size to store your wallet.dat file in. Then just mount it when you need to use it.
Its also suggested to use long passwords, all my truecrypt files use 50 character alphanumeric with symbols that are non-repeating. I then store the passwords in a password database like 1password. I then replicate the encrypted files on seven different hard drives and cloud storage that are synced together. Also make sure you secure your network and scan your computers for malware.

I would like to see some extra features included in MultiBit.
1. Create a budget valued in bitcoins or choice currency.
2. Spending chart to show how much you are spending on what.
3. Net income chart showing whether you are gaining/losing over time.
4. A description field on address to add additional information thats encrypted.
5. Builtin QR scanner so you can import images from webcams or files to add to the wallet.
6. Categorization of address for organization. Ex: Electronics, investments, shopping, people/contacts.
7. Reminders &amp; Auto payment rules to address.
For GUI Improvements:
1. I think the wallet field in MultiBit needs to be looked at. It's a nice way of showing all wallets but I don't think people will have a dozen wallets laying around. On my wallet its just empty space that could be used for something else.
2. The field showing all address under the Send/Request tabs can also be improved. If everyone on the internet starts using bitcoins then this fields could have hundreds of addresses, this could be a nightmare to shift through.
3. The sign/Verify features could be vary useful but I don't have much use for it. Maybe some sort of integration with GPG.
4. A place for all the features instead of hiding them in the menu bar where no one will see them. Maybe some sort of left hand bar with options that you can hide like a windows task bar, it seems to be all the rage at the moment. EX: 
As always, security and prevention of loss wallets at the top of this list.
Edit 1: added Features  and GUI Improvements.

When it comes to money and security some paranoia is a good thing.
The best security you can implement for a bitcoin wallet is first by taking it offline. Here is a helpful link for just that: 
To answer your questions:
1) Whats most important are the private keys in the wallet.dat file. If you lose a public address you can just regenerate the public address with the private key. When you create a new public address you are creating a private key to go with it. All this is saved in the wallet.dat file, so make sure all your backups are synced together or run the risk of losing a private key.
2) Yes, you may need to access your home folder but not your wallet.dat file. Again backups that are also encrypted.
3) If someone were to steal your wallet.dat file they would first have to decrypt it. It's possible that they could have installed a key logger and already have your bitcoins. If this happens and you still have the bitcoins in the your public address, you will need to quickly transfer the bitcoins to a new secure wallet. This is also why cold storage/offline storage is a good thing.
4) I personally keep the largest password I can generate with my password generator, 50 character, randomized with at least 10 special characters and numbers. With todays password cracking software mixed with intelligent dictionary, pattern attacks, rainbow tables, combination attacks and GPU password cracking, any password that can be found in a book and on the internet can be cracked. So go with a randomized long password saved in a secure password database like 1Password.(haha so many PASSWORDS!) A 25 character password can be secure as long as you did not use any references, in a normal human readable form or a repeat from another password.
I highly suggest looking into a good password manager, with todays cracking technology I do not trust any password that a human can think of to be secure. I currently have 113 different passwords, I know for a fact that I will never remember them all.

If you sent the bitcoins to the old address and if you still have the private key for that public address then you did not screw your self over. As long as you have the private key then you will have access.
It's possible that the transaction did not contain a mining fee and is considered low priority. Also maybe it just has not propagated around the network yet or like murbul said that VirtEx just has not send the message to the network.

Their skepticism is understandable but I wonder if they really know the implications of bitcoin and what it brings to the table as a currency?

Personally I think we need a currency to store our wealth, having some sort of savings for the future is always a good thing. Having a large population living pay check to pay check will do more harm then good.
I don't know if Bitcoin its self will survive but all of us here are confident that crypto currencies in general will.

I would keep an eye on Namecoin, its notable because it allows a decentralized naming system for use in documents, GPG and DNS.
The other coins are manly used as a hedge on bitcoin. If you trade your bitcoins back into fiat you would have to pay a capital gains tax on what you made. Alt crypto currency allow you to trade into something without having to get back into fiat. At this point its hard to bet against bitcoin with the resent media coverage and the inflow of new users into the economy.

The message is what you typed in to sign.
Here is an example:
Public address: 1HbSjt2rALAwJ7HXxU5v3koW2FYbSAB6LV
Message: Example of a signed message by the owner of this public address.
Signature: IPc9GPWZDU5mLHCiMjQpEIEHYuYzJDdbQfWllk7O+O6pi+iJ5NsSlo3Zk149s9+mkTvp6UWiFU5ebWEDUIRMSG4=
Anyone with a bitcoin client can now confirm that the person that wrote "Example of a signed message by the owner of this public address.", owns this address. Message signing is just a tool in the bitcoin client software to prove to someone that you are the owner of a set of coins.
Blockchain.info has its own system that you can attach a message onto public transactions. No one but users of blockchain.info will see the messages because its all internal.

Yes, bitcoin don't have any intrinsic value but that dose not mean they are not useful as a currency.
Here are some of the properties of bit coin.
1) instantly transfer of wealth: bitcoins are digital so you can transfer them to anyone around the world with very little to no cost to you or the network.
2) Bitcoins are stored in a public decentralized cloud: You can access your bitcoins with your private keys/wallet.dat on any internet connected device and your account can not be frozen.
3) Bitcoin transactions irreversible: This can be good or bad. Good because it cuts down on chargebacks scams like what you get with paypal. Bad you can't retrieve your bitcoins unless they are returned by the recipient.
4) Payments are sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution: This is accomplished through the blockchain witch manages who has ownership of any bitcoins. You also have the added benefit of not having send your personal information to the recipient to process your transaction, this cuts back on identity theft.
5) No financial institution, bank, company or governments: The blockchain manages ownership of your coins through cryptography.
There are stores like bitcoinstore.com that can sell you goods cheeper then amazon and newegg because they do not have to pay any fees by going through the financial institution.
I believe bitcoins are only getting started and no one knows there true value yet. If Mastercard and Visa can make billions of US dollars by being the middle man then I can say bitcoin is worth at lest that much.
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:03:57
We don't know if Bitcoin its self will succeed but I do know that crypto currencies as a hole will.
Lets assume that VISA did create a VISAcoin. If VISAcoin used exactly the same system that bitcoin uses then VISA would not have any control over it, It would just be another currency offered by VISA. If VISA changed the code so only they control it, then you start running into the same problems as the current system just with a new local currency. Then you also have the network affect that bitcoin is enjoying, that VISA would have to over come first with their standard and/or technically superior currency.
Its kind of hard for VISA to exist in its current for if the world started to use some sort of crypto currency.

SHA256 is meant to be a fast hashing algorithm. The slide is true on how long it would take to count but it's only telling a small part of the story.
Here is a link to how bitcoin address are created: 
For storing passwords SHA256 is insufficient with todays GPU's and rainbow hashing tables.
To store passwords you need a slow/hard to generate hashing algorithm like scrypt or PBKDF2.
@_date: 2013-10-01 04:42:35
Standard 64-bit word SHA256 requires 80 rounds to hash any more or less with change the output hash.
Existing miners already check the output to see if it hits the desired target. They accept a blob of data, increment the nonce and check the hash for the target.
I found this when I was searching around for more information about BitFury it the chip decaped: 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:59:25
What you are asking for is not possible in the current system with out creating a new currency. To allow everyone to keep the same amount of bitcoins at the same time and increase the amount of bitcoins that can be mined, you would have to resign all the transactions/blocks in the blockchain, starting from the beginning. This is like trying to rewrite history in all the history books on a global level.

Its best to keep the entire block chain locally to look up but it is not a requirement. The older blocks are not going to change so it's easy to just keep a database of Public Address with bitcoins and just cutout the rest, up to X date and time. The file is also vary compressible and with current storage technology we will not hit this problem for a long time.

Mt.Gox is the most populare exchange at the moment but they have been having a lot of issues trying to keep up with demand causing people to panic and sell. Its best if you pick an exchange that will sell you bitcoins at a cheeper price. You can look up exchanges at  I suggest bitstamp.com because their prices are usually lower then Mt.Gox.
To save on a lot of typing and explanation I'll just include a link to the Bitcoin wiki on paper wallets: 
If you are going to use a software wallet just make sure you encrypt your wallet.dat file with something like truecrypt.org or use a bitcoin wallet with encryption built in (bitcoinarmory.com).

As complex as language can be, the number of combinations is very limited. If you can find it in a dictionary, on the web, keyboard combinations, letter substitution and large rainbow tables. Just about any password/phrase that a human can think of can be cracked. Today just about any computer system and website requires a password, the human mind can only keep track of so many.
If you are pulling it out of your head, then its probably a terrible password/passphrase for a wallet. You are better off if you use a password generator with high entropy and saving the password/phrase in a safe place.

Seems like a blockchain can handle this already if they implement a P2P exchange ticker and use insured contracts that are broadcasted/pooled together. Maybe you can use prioritizing to help stabilized the market favoring buyer or sellers on a weighted average of the ticker.

Not with cgminer yet, I picked bfgminer because on Butterfly Labs drivers page is said it was the most advanced at the time. Looked like a good place to start testing.

Most likely still being manipulated at this time.
Looks like the market is doing a good job on pushing the prices back up.

Im willing to bet that Mt.Gox can trace accounts that are trading only at 0.01BTC frequently.
I believe one of the best ways to avoid bots is a captcha type system before a trade can be sent in to prove you are human.

A bitcoin is a bitcoin, no different then any other bitcoin. MT.Gox just keeps track of how many bitcoins they owe in your account and send them out from the main operating account accordingly.

I find the amount of volume moving at one time to be most impressive.

I don't know, a lot can happen in transit between bitinstant and Mt.Gox.

I had the same reaction when I found bitcoin at $30USD each.

Shush, the bubble is very sensitive. Don't talk about it or acknowledge its existence.

The bubble dose look to have a vary thick skin, I think there is a large push to go over $200 per coin thats driving this, after that who knows. Maybe over $250 per coin, above from april as the next stop before a correction.
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:57:41
What everyone said, plus you also need to remember the fees when you trade or you will just be losing money. Currently for Mt.Gox, if the spread is not grater then $2.36 from the high to the low, you will not profit. You will also need some trading software because trading through the website is to damn slow.

Im noticing the same thing, thats why I stay just in front of where the resistance is.

Personally I like the explanation from mrb's blog. 
It describes some of the properties of bitcoin and what each of them means.

Do you have a cell phone bill under your name?
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:17:16
Hmm, my bet is $375 per coin if the media gets in and a correction to $300.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:12:07
I also agree its moving to fast to quickly, you and a lot of people are getting nervous that a crash could happen soon. This doesn't breed confidence in a currency if everyone is on edge and could sell out at any moment. Currently bitcoin is the victim of its own success and if we are not carful this could prove the media right in that its a bubble.
Maybe it's a good thing that Mt.Gox can only do 1,000 verifications a day. To much demand could blow the roof off this party.
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:23:25
The prices on Mt.Gox are high because people are having trouble getting USD out of Mt.Gox at the moment and is causing prices to be higher then normal. If you can get USD out at a reasonable speed then thats a huge arbitrage opportunity.
Bitcoin addresses have two parts, the private key and the public address. The private key shows ownership of the public address and any unspent bitcoins attached to it. So keep your private key in a safe place and never give it to anyone.
When an exchange transfers bitcoins to your public address, the exchange will sign with it's private key and send the message with the amount of unspent bitcoins and fees for miners to your public address via the bitcoin network. All the bitcoin clients will then forward the message to the rest of the network including the miners. The miners are then in a mathematical race with each other to show proof of work for the next block in the blockchain. The reward for adding a new block to the blockchain is the block reward plus the transaction fees from all the transactions. Once your transaction is accepted into the main blockchain, the BTC is immediately spendable by anyone holding the private key that generated the public key. Your bitcoin wallet just has to download the latest blocks to know that you received bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:10:04
As long as you enter the same public key that the bitcoins are being sent to then yes, you did it correctly. This is just proof that you own the private key.
Now why your bitcoins are not showing up is another matter.
You can use Blockchain.info and confirm whether or not you received the bitcoins outside of the wallet client.
Double check your order log at VirtEx and make sure that the public address match your wallet address.
Also VirtEx could have not sent the message yet. You may need to contact VirtEx with the problem and the public address showing no BTC being received.

Where did you get the 28nm's from? Avalon uses 110nm, BitForce uses 65nm, ASICminer at a 130nm and BitFury is using 55nm. BitFury is using 756 cores and an unknown SHA-256 design that could be just another Open IP standard that everyone is using.
With a 55nm process you can add a lot more hashing cores with lower wattage in the same area. This alone with the same ~7.5mm die size can explain the high hash to wattage.
So argument stands new chips and designs generally brings improvements.
EDIT 1: Found the 28nm spec you where looking at. The Minion ASIC from Black Arrow is 28nm at 64 cores using 1.5Ghz clock. 0.5W/GHash vs BitFury's 0.85W/GHash, looks like they are taking advantage of the smaller process and higher clock rates. The advantage of using a higher clock with just a few cores is using smaller die sizes with the same core design. This can translate to cheaper chips but with higher rate of defective chips when manufacturing. Its hard to say if they are using smaller chips because they have not listed the die size.

The media have never been very tech savvy.
Once a big tech player like google, apple, amazon, etc gets into the mix things could get interesting.

It would be nice to have a NFC type of technology but I would also be worried about the security of the system. Its harder to attack a QR type system then with a wireless technology that can be read/write at a distance. You also need some sort of power source for the NFC/bluetooth system to work. QR codes also have the advantage of being printable by anyone and passed around just as easily and the majority of people already know how to use.
NFC/Bluetooth can be used with devices in the future but not on posters or any kind of non electronic device thats cheap and reproducible.

Ok, we were looking at different chips.
Can't expect different companies to make the same design decisions on the chips but you cant say that moving to 28nm would not improve the performance on next generation ASIC mining rigs. Example would be Black Arrow's Minion chip at 0.5W/Gh.
I've seen the post from Senseless, full custom design is not saying anything about how efficiency the SHA-256 algorithm. The performance is most likely contributed to the specifications they decided for manufacturing the chip. He is after all using 756 cores, 55nm at 250-900Mhz, that says a lot about the performance.

You can only bet a bot if you know the algorithm that they run on.
Like other people said bots can be used for liquidation but the down side is they have been known to be the cause of market crashes. Some European countries have even proposed to ban them.

Sorry about that, I tend to look at a lot of information.
Here is a better logarithmic chart:

No, it's the Jalapeño 5Gh/s.
I placed my order when it was selling at $149 at 4.5Gh/s, so I was pleased on the upgrade.
I think its just some sort of fluke on when the software counts how much work its done. The average performance difference between my iMac i5 vs Mac Mini Core 2 Duo running the same OS, same pool and same software is showing a difference of 500Mh/s on BitMinter but with high CPU loads on the Mac Mini because of Java. I also did the same test with bfgminer with about 400Mh/s difference from what I can tell and with vary little CPU use on both machines. This makes me wonder if a bottle neck exists between running the software and feeding the ASIC miner.
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:15:49
Thats true when they will be shipping in October. It's just like with CPU's and GPU's the next generation will always be more efficient and powerful.
