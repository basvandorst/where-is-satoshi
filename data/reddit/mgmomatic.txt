This circle of death is made up of lemmings that have leapt to defeat. In the centre are owl eggs. Mama owl arranged a secure barrier made from the corpses of said lemmings to protect her unborn brood. Gruesome...I'd agree. In short, mama owl has made lemonade out of lemmings. Yuck! Yuck! Guffaw!! Snort!

Why ETH for your e.g? They are a potent protocol w/ mucho global partnerships and BETA testing galore in the works. I also get the vibe that they are completely transparent with gov't authorities. HODL!

Ver and Co. are rotten pukes. Toss Conbase and the other BCH grift enablers in too. All these new extra billions over the 36 hours will not make them more interesting, or charming, or special -- another punk  w/ no imagination and money to buy car # 7 and vacation home  He is a criminal and a slimeball. And no, I am not jealous. I got into crypto a few years back while you noobs were picking at your chin pimples. I've done $olid on my various crypto types and I did so legally not like the sociopathic groups out there in cryptoland. I believe in the protocol over Moons and Lambo B$ and that it can make the globe a more even playing field for the poor and disenfranchised. HODL!

Wow! these PRICKS! are all the same. When there is a price drop due to whatever (DDoS attack, weak hands, pump n' dump, online hack/theft, etc.) they smell blood like a school of starved sharks and FUD! the holy mother FUCK!! outta the mainstream press w/ more deceit and lies -- I mean that's how they all make a living in their everyday existences. There has got to be functioning karma (I hope...) in a next life or whatever for this herpes bunch. HODL!

Did some BTC hodl'rs back in the '14 crash from $1000 to $200 actually commit suicide? Links to this?  Geeesh!...it's just moola folks. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:12:29
Fine...it's a newbie @ 8 years of age. But they never seem to bring that up. Like it's been a cancer on earth forever. If you think though that most of their pontificating is virtue based thinking: "We bankers are just concerned about our nations, and our finances, and the wee folk who drop moola in their savings accounts..." then you are either myopic pal or your 60s Summer of Love rose-colored glasses are blocking the light of truth.  HODL !

Don't be "those" weak hands -- the central system wants you to dump!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:43
Totes! The weak handed noobs to the sector maybe got a grand profit or so per coin and went: "Daddy's going to Walmart!" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:36
Yes, it's really quite astonishing (or maybe it shouldn't be) RE. all the FUD, of course, but more so the lack of questioning the central fiat system - period. It's the definition of a 'sheeple' single mindset. A desperate attempt to keep old thinking ways alive and kicking....
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:11:35
This is unavoidable -- sadly. BTC and other cryptos want the entire globe to access these new digital freedoms and powers via blockchain brilliance. But with that fervent desire  comes more and more noobs who are often quite irritating, only in for a quickie buck, and undereducated about the sector. It's a double-edged sword;  the new blood ramp up prices for us long term HODLers but in turn also demonstrate weak hands when they can't stomach standard large dips...and end up crashing prices. It's a snake swallowing itself -- on and on the cycle flows.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:00:01
Heehee! The opening rocket packs are purfecto! -- kind of a witty metaphor for crypto being The Jetsons-like future in currency space and a few dozen more global spaces too.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:19:49
But it is not too late - or is it? I mean the devs and heads @ BTC and other crypto projects should be now examining all this foolishness and preparing to battle a danger of central institutions injecting themselves into what should be a decentralized future for all. I hope these folks are not sleeping @ the wheel and are making plans to stop any B$! like central involvement in the near future. Or, as some conspiracy types see it, this was always from the start set-up by the central banking elite (BTC, etc.) and they are fooling us all into buying this open source/no third party mega bank crapola narrative con job. Keeps many up at night this scenario...

The "experts" part is quite ironic considering how many of these post educated financial fellows have fek'd over economies, cities, nations, workers, unions, each other and moral codes for a good century plus.
