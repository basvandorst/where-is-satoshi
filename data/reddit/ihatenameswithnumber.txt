LOL you sure are ignorant.   
Here is some Christmas break reading for you.  Maybe in the future learn a bit about what you are arguing, not everyone will take the time to educate you like I am.
Oh, guess who was fighting for more lenient taxing of cryptos.    Hint: Not the Republicans ������

Paul Ryan wore a red tie today, definitely a clear signal that Bitcoin well be necessary to buy daily goods by 2018.

The federal government already was getting a slice of the pie, Trump just changed that to the whole fucking cake.
Nice try on "both sides woulda done it" but it looks only one side really did ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:50:31
Oh man, have you been defending the crypto tax change this entire time without actually knowing any facts?
Yikes!  Wish I could say I'm surprised ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:34:27
You must be new to crypto....
They were taxed as capital gains when you cashed out.  Now you are going to be paying a shit ton more taxes on EACH TRANSACTION.
Get the fuck out of here with your fake news.
Cryptocurrency just got fucked by Trump, whenever you wanna believe it or not - the tax man won't care ��

I think I'll be fine, you clearly prefer taking a more conservative approach to the soon to be antiquated IRS code.  We should behave within our own safety parameters.

Probably buying everybody's bitcoin for 11k and selling at 20k

He literally just signed a bill giving the IRS more teeth in taxing cryptocurrency transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:06:26
You are trying way too hard.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:43:15
Scared money was on it being one, not smart money ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:43:59
Trump's tax bill just fucked over cryptos, but good try.

Unless you have been verified by an exchange already you're gonna SOL for a few days.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:20:59
Every crypto transaction will be a taxable event.  Even trading between cryptos.  
Have you traded before? Real stocks? You are about to learn how Uncle Sam is gonna get that 2,500 back REAL fast ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:58:44
Yikes, you seem pretty defensive for someone caught making up bullshit ��
Paying long term capital gains tax on a like property held over 1 year IS paying your fair share.
But go on, tell me more about how the law is SUPPOSED to be ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:16:05
You have been treating the exchange of one cryptocurrency into another as a taxable event?? 
������ That's the funniest thing I've read all year.
You are so full of shit I can smell you from here.   "I've been complying with a law that hasn't existed yet, believe me!"
Don't worry, I'm sure when Uncle Sam sticks his big red white and blue cock up your ass you will find some way to blame everybody but Trump
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:44:48
You won't get long term capital gains as easily.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:49:41
"was supposed to be there"
Got a source on that?
Uncle Sam was getting his tax either way - but savvy investors prefer to pay them as long term capital gains instead of having it lumped into personal income.
You have just been practicing paying more taxes, congrats, because thanks to Trump that's how trading crypto is gonna be now.

Did you reply to the right person?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:11:07
Conducting a business transaction is definitely NOT the only reason people switch among different cryptos.   
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:43:45
It isn't gray anymore, it's now the law.
Thanks for increasing my crypto taxes, Trump.  ��

Only when you cash out back into USD is necessary to report.
Going BTC to ETH to BTC to LTC to BTC to USD would be one event.  
Now you get taxed every step of the way.
