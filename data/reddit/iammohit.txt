Rookie to a rookie, I went into it like some weeks back only and with investment that I can afford to lose. With such a wide fluctuating market as this, you don't put in your hard earned and particularly essential money.

Cool, but I saw your other comments and it seemed like you are involved with bitcoin development as well?

Is it okay to have a hardware wallet and also have its backup on onedrive or google drive? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:22:23
seems to be normal, transaction fees have skyrocketed
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:52:48
No offence, and I am a noob here, who are you?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:27:09
does it need a sign up or just works?

Is it evil in long term or just evil because it's competing with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:37:11
Where would you then? Paper backups? Have seen people suggesting them here...

Who knows maybe this will reach r/all in a bestof post next year
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:48:31
Then it will not lead in decreased transaction times?

You are believing it right. 
I am not really giving it a thought if it feels right or not... it felt right before investing, now it's just a watch game.

This guy prints it
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:43:56
I am pretty sure it will be below 20k or above 20k. I am like 99% sure.

What else he owns? And Why is he a fuck?

Hiding in plain sight. Haven’t you seen Batman? What kind of a joke is this? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:00:12
The only thing I could think of while watching it was what's with those huge cameras? Did they wanted to count his nose hair or something? LOL
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:27:21
Brilliant idea!

It's just hard to believe that he is not the one. He is trying so hard to come out as dumb with his dumb statements, observations and language usage but a man of such intelligence can't be this dumb.

What happened to lightening? Last I remember it was all the rage some 12 months back - I stopped following bitcoin in between and would have thought lightening would have matured by now and getting used in day to day transactions but no.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:14:23
cool, got it!
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:10:15
fingers crossed 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:07:57
for bitcoin you mean? because usually any bank transfer I have ever done has been mostly instant or finished in some minutes.

What movies are you watching!? Bollywood movies are not 5 hour long, not even close.
