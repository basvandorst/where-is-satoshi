This is coming from Jerome Powell. He has been explaining to Trump why they can't reduce rates. Can anyone confirm they have met in the past 24 hours? Or at least indicators they point to this possibility?

Not enough solid price/technical analysis in this space - thank you - and my best regards to you Sir.

This is my post from a few months ago... Had the same idea. This theft needs to be better understood and recognised by us all.
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:49:48
This is the correct answer.

I was setting it as "ssh admin instead of "admin :) All set up now!!

If the assumption that it is a 'whale' manipulating is true, perhaps they are doing a Bitcoin community service? Put a lot of Bitcoin on the market, force the price down - shake out weak hands? Offer those that are fully confident and accumulating a chance to buy at a discount?
I think there would be quite a few 'whales' who are in this game for philosophical reasons - ready to use their clout to test the system's (including us, the holder's) resilience - not just to 'manipulate' the market to become even wealthier.

Yea, I really do think

Here is the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing website:  [
Here, you can see the annual production of notes by them until 2017. 
For fun, I put that table into excel to count up the value of the notes printed since 1980 (i.e count up the number of each denomination and then multiply by the value of that denomination). The total number came to $5,304,701,680,000. That's 5 trillion. But of course, they regularly replace the old notes that are getting old and tattered... ;) That's why the Federal Reserve website gives such a different number:  [

Hahaha... It must suck to live in a police state.
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:10:14
Yep, ended up doing that. All set up now! Thanks
@_date: 2019-06-18 10:27:35
Thank you so much for the tip! Just receiving this is a leap in consciousness. This is hard money, sent in an instant across the world with tiny fees. Such beautiful technology! 
Thanks for the advice, I will make those wallet set-ups my next step.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:17:53
Fair enough. I'll try to plug it in again when I get home... However, I still suspect it might make a difference. My understanding is that there are multiple visual outputs generated by Raspiblitz. There is the admin and pi login (both can be separately SSH'd and both are different from a visual perspective)
@_date: 2019-06-18 02:44:39
Thanks for that!! Really appreciated! :) Next I just need some incoming capacity!
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:33:19
Well, perhaps it's enough to get a rough idea by just measuring asset price inflation - a basket of 'stores of value' like property, stocks, Bitcoin etc.
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:20:06
Because it feels good to live in a society where everyone is involved and has a place? Even bankers (assuming they do what their role requires of them).
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:08:40
I get the argument made in the articles. Adds to the evidence of the inability to service debt - doesn't quite 'prove' it for me yet, but getting there. :)
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:18:18
Yes, agree with that. It is doing it's job. To be honest, if it serves the function to make them honest (I know, unlikely), then I would be happy with that. It can go back to $200 a coin and just be waiting in the wings for any hints of anomalous/dishonest behaviours by the bankers.
If that scenario was even remotely possible, it would make sense not to sell the wife and kids to buy more. An affordable hedge should be sufficient.
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:41:00
Yes, Bitcoin is a hedge for me. Although I'm (relatively) maximalist, it will still take time. And if it does go hyper, then a hedge should be enough (I.e. Half a coin or so. Or less if that is what you can afford).
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:38:10
Yes, true. I guess I focus on the feature which is most important to me. I don't have a problem with government, taxes (even high ones), censorship, borderlessness or even monitoring. Just my personal position, I know these things are important to others.
@_date: 2019-04-12 04:42:40
I prefer to read. Found this article:
The most interesting words:
"But why didn't prices rise in the 1920s? Because the enormous increase in productivity and the supply of goods offset the increase of money. This offset did not, however, prevent a crash from developing, even though it did avert price inflation."
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:09:00
If Bitcoin wasn't invented, gold would be worth more now. Bitcoin is a direct competitor. Time will tell how much of the 'market' Bitcoin will take from gold.
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:55:08
So, I wonder if it's possible to 'prove' (or at least provide strong support to the fact) that actually, the Fed can't increase rates beyond a certain amount as it would make debt un-repayable. That would be good... If I knew they couldn't increase rates due to the systemic risk, I would buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:35:12
I'm not suggesting that it will happen, I agree with you, I don't think it will, but just exploring the possibility - even it is very remote as you say. :)
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:06:09
Except the fact that they tried to raise/normalise over the last few years... No one seemed to understand why they did that. I believe the Fed tried to save the currency. I believe they will try to raise again later this year, even though no one else seems to think that.
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:17:22
Haha, good point!
@_date: 2019-04-12 11:50:50
VERY GOOD! Thanks for that. In the last 15 minutes they talked about what I was trying to work out in my mind. There is a lot of inflation, but because of deflation caused by tech disruption, it's somewhat hidden. They linked with the Gilet Jaunes in France too... Good illustrative point of the upset the situation causes regular people.
They mentioned a liquidity trap... Interesting concept. I don't quite get this 100% yet, but I'm going to look into it. On the surface, I think this is what we have now.
Interesting the interviewee suggested that QE later in the year isn't as much of a sure thing as many commentators think. I don't think it will happen either.
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:21:29
Haha, you are probably right! I'll try to calm down from this delusion and get my mind straight again!
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:22:01
Thanks for your answer, appreciate it! I get the impression your position is similar to mine. It's a tool to give central bankers less opportunity to be dodgy. You then believe there is still plenty of upside - guess this is my position as well. Next step is to work out just how much upside.
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:35:49
"fix" means allowing interest rates to rise to a natural rate.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:52:37
This is not a conspiracy theory for me. It is sensible, self-interested gamesmanship.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:10:48
Look up 'Bitcoin exchange' - find one that seems reputable in the UK. Sign up with all your ID just like opening a bank account. Follow their instructions to transfer your money on to the exchange. Buy what you feel comfortable with as a starting point. Buy a Trezor or Ledger (google them) and follow their instructions of use to take your newly purchased Bitcoin off the exchange into these 'cold wallets' (a few weeks after purchasing should be fine). Read the Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. After you have read it, if the price is still within reach, buy more Bitcoin (and store it properly) as per above.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:49:47
It's not a theory based on conjecture - it is conjecture. Just an initial thought at this stage that I want to consider for a while as the evidence comes out (if it does).
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:04:50
Agree with the thrust of this analysis. I think things will happen a lot sooner than many people will think. A lot of people will hold off in the next cycle thinking it's just another bubble that will pop like 2017. 2017 didn't have all the talk of Modern Monetary Theory and the 'debt is ok' messaging. Things are really, really far gone right now.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:51:05
Beautiful thoughts, and it's exactly what people in this space need to be exposed too. However, I'll just point out that in this space, it's possible that you need to go all out obsessive hardcore for a short period (weeks or even months) in order to 'upgrade' your mental software. After you go obsessive for a month or two (or three), make your position (i.e. buy and secure the number of Bitcoin/Satoshis that you feel comfortable to own), then spend a week or two confirming in your mind that this is the position that you are happy with and at the present time and that it doesn't need to be more or less - as well as decide if you will continue buying after that and under what conditions. Then... let it go. You have your position, you have your strategy, go back to living life, whatever that is for you.
But, you do need to do that obsessive/hard (is it hard?) work as a starting point. The idea is that this initial Obsessive Compulsive time investment should pay off with lots of living in the present and returning to roots in a few years when adoption explodes.
Or another option - get into the real tech as opposed to 'research'. Set up a Bitcoin and/or Lightning node.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:51:15
Pump and plateau is trickle buying for them. They are working with such huge amounts (and a limited buying window), they can't reduce the buys to even smaller 'trickle' sized amounts.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:39:43
Hold for now - after you read your new book, you will see that it's most useful aspect is its ability to hold value. You can buy stuff with it one day - perhaps after the price levels out and the 'off-chain' infrastructure is more mature. After you read the book, read up on the Lightning Network online.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:46:39
That's why I think it's a sovereign nation. I don't think this kind of buying is from a company/investment fund. Traditional finance and investment banks always have a very lofty place in our minds as to their financial clout and their pecking order in our fiat societies, but it's important to remember that they are not centrally controlled and can't suddenly throw all their weight into Bitcoin. They are the 'fiat kings'. Sovereign nations and central banks are the 'money kings' - as long as its money, it's their business, whatever type of money it is.
