Who gives a shit what people say. You in it to get attention or to use it as an alternative to banks and the likes?

Well I don't see anyone putting a virtual bitcoin in a strippers crotch strap or rolling one up to snort cocaine laced baby powder...if that is what you mean.

You for more than what you paid for? Send that shit to a different wallet and disconnect your banking info. GG.

Bitcoin may not, but the crypto that pops up using similar technology in 3rd word crisis seem to help and be functional... But in first world/big picture stuff people don't seem to realize there is a smaller % holding the most, as you said.

I think the question asked here is give a step by step... What to do to get said words as a key and how to recover it. Help the noobs out, please.

Coinbase is a motherfucker. Of you live in NYS it is one of the only ways to get into the market via the bitlicense red tape the state rarely gives out.

They definitely never fucked anyone over before...take the W

The 5th story this week with different amounts... No one want to point out it fucked the banks over and not the consumer... Bithumb can't say that...

Can we be more clear... People lost 30Million through this website. The company likely lost little compared to the users. Right? Why every article each time a hack it makes the exchange as the victim...

As I understand only a UI change. Not a walker change like bitthumb...

Idk. I think it is branding related. I dislike the change but Coinbase pro is working now, just a UI change. Gdax will die on end date in cohple of days. I will miss Gdax. Not a fan of the new pro look... But not a wallet upgrade that can be hackable as I understand it. I will be xovering my ads though as I don't want to deal with any unforseen hiccups (and I mean fuck ups) just to be safe...
