I know nothing about ADL. I assume it's the auto liquidation feature to prevent negative equity but uses obscure algorithms. There's a lot I don't know about BitMEX since I have never used it. You should write about the pros and cons of using BitMEX first hand and educate the newcomers.

I appreciate all the feedback guys. I don't post very often and I am very surprised of the turnout for this one.
I've added two notes in the article to address some of the issues mentioned in the comments. 
If you have ten mins to spare, I'd also like your feedback on this:
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:36:13
Thank you!

Well, it's not really an assumption. If there're only makers there would be no trades. As far as I know, Bitfinex was hacked a while back &amp; they dealt with it beautifully. I don't know much about USDT &amp; don't use it. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 02:52:44
Hey thanks for the feedback.  I edited my concluding paragraph to be more precise. No where on Bitmex does it clearly indicate that its fee is increased by the same ratio as the leverage. Without knowledge of the actual fee, how is one supposed to know whether or not they will like 50X or 100X before entering a trade?
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:20:49
What I'd hope to achieve ultimately is not to bash BitMEX for its own sake. What I want them to realize is that they're looking at a small piece of the pie when there's a whole pie factory out there. If they were to behave ethically &amp; responsibly, at least in the eyes of the regulators, we'd all benefit as Bitcoin enthusiasts. It's impossible for regulators to look past the fact that you can trade such a volatile asset on such high leverage at such a big exchange. Sure, Bitcoin itself is decentralized and nothing short of a natural disaster can censor our transactions but shouldn't we at least try make it easy on ourselves to get mass adoption? By that I mean getting past the lawmakers and regulators. Shouldn't we encourage these people who have authority &amp; power to do the right thing for the benefit of all?
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:24:54
Yes are you right I should have mentioned that. I have never used BitMEX myself &amp; only seen trades done at market. However, I think there are still many people paying that taker's fee and it is so profitable that they can move into an office at $5M/year. [
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:59:33
Yes you are correct that making the market would get you a rebate, but if everyone is a maker then there wouldn't been any trades would there? In theory, yes I think users should know of all the risk of the platform they use. The reality is that even professionals make mistakes given tools this powerful.

I read some stuff about them trading against their customers and calling it providing liquidity. I don't remember the link to that. Is that what you are referring to?
@_date: 2018-09-19 06:32:19
Right. Forgive me for not being an avid poster and native speaker.
I said that 50x or 100x can be useful for hedging in my article as it requires less collateral. And the claims in the article are based on facts. What misinformation are you referring to?
As for the " when avg loss per trade = margin lost on liquidation", it does not sound like much of a strategy to me.
@_date: 2018-09-19 03:35:17
Actually I have never even used Bitmex. Can you honestly say that their fee page is implying that at 100x the fee is 7.5%?
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:13:45
Of course. I think 100x leverage is an easy concept to understand in theory. I think Lehman Brothers also understood how their 30x leverage worked back in 2007, until they got rekt.
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:15:08
Exactly. I think they should put something like your comment up on their fee page &amp; in the perpetual contract example page. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 22:38:49
Bitcoin does have a fixed supply. Crypto currencies as a whole do not. Anyone can copy Bitcoin’s code but it would not be Bitcoin. Just like any country can print its own money but not garner the same confidence as the US dollar. 
As for government declaring Bitcoin illegal like China did last year, I agree that it would cause people to be fearful of it. But such a move by any democratic government would be a PR suicide. In fact, if all governments were to unanimously declare Bitcoin illegal, I’d argue that would affirm the fact that Bitcoin does indeed have value. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:28:09
Thank you for the support =)
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:42:19
Yes you are right. That comparison to Bitfinex's fees does not measure up equally by notional value. But the comparison to IB's fees is correct by notional value.
@_date: 2018-09-16 02:20:55
Sure I agree with you on the slow down. Fiat currencies also fail and disappear, even without any government banning them. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:29:40
Yea you are right. I'm sure they're doing a lot of things right to generate such volume. Props to Mr. Hayes for that. But that doesn't make them immune to criticism. In fact they should be very open minded about it &amp; encourage it in anticipation of future competition. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:48:42
I rly wish Coinbase paid me to write this.
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:26:28
If I'm understanding you correctly Bitmex is taking minimal amount of settlement fee, if any and their priority is to create liquidity in the order book by subsidizing the makers fee at a loss in illiquid markets. Do you have any data on the amount of settlement fee they collected and the amount of makers fee paid out?
@_date: 2018-09-19 04:40:39
Agreed. I do not feel bad for those who seal their own fate. I feel as though BitMEX should aim higher &amp; can do much more for this community than trying to make some extra fees by misleading people in that aspect. These big exchanges have the regulators' eyes. Without regulators approval we're not gonna get institutional money, and I want Bitcoin to moon just everyone else here.
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:40:14
I really appreciate your feedback btw. Without it I was having a hard time getting to my point &amp; I felt like I was misunderstood. I edited the article to include some of these sentiments in hope that people will understand I am not just here to bash BitMEX &amp; see the bigger picture.
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:49:50
0.075% is correct. Leverage 100X that becomes 7.5% on your invested amount.
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:17:36
@_date: 2018-09-19 00:01:41
That sounds rly fucked up and if a business depended on this exchange to hedge their exposure, they could take massive losses because of ADL. Who's to blame then? Thanks for the insight
@_date: 2018-09-18 19:38:18
Well I don't have an opinion on that &amp; I do not know much about this. I think illuminatiman was suggesting that they are indeed manipulating the price. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 04:19:46
I rly dont know what strategies are sound at 50x &amp; 100x leverage on crypto. If you do please share with us.
I have a few books on position size including CFA textbooks &amp; books by Ben Graham, Peter Lynch, and Ray Dalio. Do you have any author you suggest?
I really dont know what that means &amp; I really dont know why you are so fascinated with my account history (Yes, I enjoy playing Dota 2 as the name suggest).
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:04:14
Thanks for all the info.
I looked through the perpetual swap example page &amp; the fee page and couldn't find it anywhere that says that the fee is based on notional amount. If you care, please take a look at IB's page, where they state very clearly it's on trade value and give a clear example: [
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:03:32
It's alright no offense taken. I just wanted to write based on what I know &amp; my experience watching others trade on this platform. I didn't suggest at all that they're manipulating the price in the article.
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:04:59
Interesting that you bring that up. Why is it such a notable thing that someone would risk being called a hypocrite for monetary gains?
And are you arguing that the fees in its entirety go to the makers?
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:52:53
I think if you actually read &amp; understood my article you'd ask the question: If the users already knew Bitmex is expensive, why are they using it? Perhaps it is because Bitmex is taking advantage of the users' tendencies to gamble (at their monetary loss because the odds are simply stacked against them) &amp; in the process generating hefty profits. Or perhaps the users did not know or didn't care to know. In either scenario, I believe this article has some value.
