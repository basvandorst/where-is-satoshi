Looks like we've got a real politician here:
"This does not support my agenda hence I feel the need to detest the facts."

Because BTC, even inside Coinbase, is a deflationary global currency as opposed to every fiat currency on the planet?
You don't need control over your private keys to benefit from **not having your wealth stolen from you in the form of inflation**.

OK, Litecoin guy: I thought the entire point of a deflationary monetary supply was to reward **SAVING over SPENDING**.
Unsurprisingly, the  use case for Bitcoin is far and away **cold storage savings outside the grasp of the political system and financial system**. Do you dispute this fact?
You can buy your lattes on [perpetual payment channels]( featuring instant payment confirmation and nearly free transactions:


In short, why would you want to optimize a *deflationary money* around SPENDING it? You don't need megablocks when folks can float $10k on perpetual payment channels to cover their daily spends.

1. You're comparing apples to oranges.
2. Bitcoin has value because, IN COLD STORAGE, it isn't subject to the whims of the political system or financial system. Without that technological benefit, Bitcoin is Ripple and is hence utterly worthless.
To the first point: Coinbase, Circle and Xapo aren't even close to being at 40% capacity. You're comparing banks to the blockchain whereas I'm comparing banks to banks.
To the second point: Let's say tomorrow the black swan event of the millenium happens and BILLIONS of people adopt Bitcoin. Well guess what, technology isn't going to be good enough to fit them all on the chain. You can mash the downvote button as hard as you want, it ain't going to change TSMC's business plans. If this black swan happened, BILLIONS would *have to* use LN, Coinbase or sidechains PERIOD due to obvious technological constraints that are simply facts of life in 2015.
And did you know [perpetual payment channels]( over LN will be a thing? Quoting the paper's author:


Billions of people will be able to float $10K on Lightning instead of putting it in cold storage, while still having a trustless form of cash.
