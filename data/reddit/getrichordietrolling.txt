Coinbase is absolutely not unregulated. Especially as far as USD accounts and transactions are concerned, they are FDIC insured and heavily regulated as other financial institutions are in the U.S.

It effects the amount of Bitcoins available for sale on exchanges, so it effects the price.

Yeah, it's definitely not something you want to buy at the height of a price spike, you have to be careful about when you buy in as the premium on BTC is magnified during a price spike (i.e. the premium was maybe 20% a month ago, but jumped to over 100% when the BTC price spiked in late May). But if you buy in when price is stabilized, it isn't nearly as bad as a 100% premium. With market-traded funds you always have to keep in mind that they are more prone to speculation than a commodity itself may be.

Look at the actual holdings of BTC per share (e.g. Grayscale/GBTC holds 0.093 BTC per share) and divide by the market price for a share of the fund and subtract the market price of BTC. So if 1 share of GBTC is going for $400, and one BTC is going for $3000, then you are paying a premium of (400/0.093) - 3000 = 1838.71 or 61.3% on the raw price of BTC. 
As I mentioned, this premium goes up and down with the price fluctuations of BTC, but tends to magnify the speculation effects. So in May, the premium was about 20% (i.e. BTC was approaching $2000 and GBTC was going for about $200-220/share), but when the BTC price spiked in late May the price for GBTC spiked way more to the point where the premium was more than 100% where GBTC was going for like $560/share at the peak but BTC was only going for like $2500. It has since come down to earth a little bit.

If you are only wanting to invest for long term returns (i.e. not to be doing day-to-day transactions in BTC), you can buy shares of a BTC investment fund. For example, [Grayscale]( is traded on the standard stock exchanges and holds ~0.1 BTC per share. [Global Advisors]( has a similar fund publicly traded in European exchanges.
Bear in mind that you will pay a *significant premium for these types of funds (e.g. a fund holding 0.1 BTC / share will probably cost more than if you bought 0.1 BTC on an exchange). However, you will get better security by buying from an established and regulated brokerage account, and you are way less likely to draw undue attention from tax authorities  because you will get straight forward tax forms from your brokerage firm (depending on your country of course). If you're ready to invest a million Euros, it might be good to consider these "conventional" types of funds which can still give returns parallel to the BTC market.
Edit: *there can be a really significant premium, especially in a gold rush time, where you're paying double or more for the actual price of BTC per share. So definitely keep this in mind.
