I wish I understood that back when it was 5k.

I've been waiting to be verified on Gemini for over 3 weeks myself 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:46:59
I'm begging for suggestions otherwise. I'm stuck with pending purchases on Coinbase and Gemini as had over 3 weeks to verify my id. Any suggestions for a noob please?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:41:47
It's been 2 weeks already for me and still nothing. I do want to move everything out of Coinbase, but unfortunately am stuck there until I'm verified.

I'm still waiting on Gemini to verify my id :(
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:20:26
I'm hodling on to the small amount I was able to buy during the dip, but because I didn't want to buy with Coinbase anymore (plus I was blocked from buying during the insane dip) and Gemini is taking a very long time to verify my id, I missed the dip to 11k-13k. Pretty bummed about this and just wanted to share. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:25:20
I currently have invested in BTC, ETH and LTC 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:53:47
Would be great if they finally get around to verifying my id

I'm pretty new to all this, can you do the same to Gemini? how do you do that? I'd appreciate advice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:55:37
I've been trying to verify mine for 2 days and keep getting "Failed: unknown response status". Why does it keep doing that? Noob here and pretty concerned. If Gemini works better, then I will take my business with them instead, since I can't even get properly started with Coinbase.

It's so awesome, gets you pumped up! 
@_date: 2019-10-01 01:30:05
I will remember that for next time
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:05:31
Pretty please let's keep the price steady until the end of this month so I can buy more with my paycheck, kthx
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:11:36
How do you go about buying anonymously? Isn't that going into illegal moves? Not accusing, genuinely curious of what you said.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:57:11
Would love to buy more, but can't after the unexpected increase in my property tax bill. Ugh.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:14:49
Same. I wish I had enough to buy another full coin, but I just can't. The only hope I have is to save up enough to grab some again in the future when it dips once more
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:17:32
I'd like to know please
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:53:48
Really like that she's giving financial advice to her younger followers and encouraging them to look into Bitcoin. And her Em Cosmetics products are great too
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:56:32
Hodling on!
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:26:19
Had I waited until the end of August to buy rather than buying at the start of August, I'd have had enough to buy at 4 digit
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:16:58
Flash sale!
@_date: 2019-09-18 22:10:52
I'm hoping to do that as well. That or if it surges to 100k near the end of this year to do the same. Need to have the savings for a downpayment on a home.

Hello, I have a question regarding Coinbase vs Gemini. I've read on here somewhere that one is a better option for large buys vs smaller scheduled buys? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:41:32
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:09:08
So I have both Gemini and Coinbase accounts, though don't have anything kept in the accounts. If I'm buying weekly, which would be the better to use? I've read conversations here that one is better for large buys and one better for small frequent buys.

I transferred cash to coinbasepro so I can purchase while it was at 7k, but after I initiated it I found out it won't be available until October 3rd. Despite the low fees, this is why I switched to Gemini. Frustrated to have missed 7k.

I want to understand more of how the capital gains taxes are tracked for BTC. I understand that with income, paychecks, stock investments, etc, it is tracked and recorded for tax purposes. If one is buying and selling on a platform like Coinbase or Gemini etc, how is the capital gains reported? Genuinely interested because I can't make sense of how it's done.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:08:31
Bought the top. Still gonna hodl because selling now will be a definite loss. Hodling gives a chance.
