Bitcoin's time lock feature only pends a transaction for a specified duration and isn't a sophisticated-enough smart contact to ensure  the losing party actually pays up. Ethereum can, you clown.

"Might", so he good.

If you're so confident, lock in your bet(s) with smart contract(s) on the Ethereum platform, you clown.

He a grown-ass man, according to his username.

You've been conned. My condolences.

So that we can moon. Thank you, Satoshi.

What about Ethereum???

I'd kill myself.

As long as you practice good cyber hygiene and  don't become a victim of a targeted hack, it shouldn't be a problem. Unless you're an active trader, why take that chance, though? Keep your crypto in cold storage for added protection. FDIC insurance means nothing if the hacker successfully hacks your personal Coinbase account and siphons your crypto. 
From Coinbase website: 
"Please note that the insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account."

(Current price - avg purchase price) x (# BTC bought) = profit
Don't forget capital gains tax which will eat into your profit margin.

IP spoofing can allow hackers to bypass that.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:46:38
Yep, you've been hacked. My condolences. Think of investing in a hardware wallet next time.

Were they kept on an exchange? If so, did you have 2FA enabled?

Damn, son. Coming in hot there.
