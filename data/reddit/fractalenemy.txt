Here's the lyrics to Bob Dylan' prescient "the Times they are a-changin'"
Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.
**Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again**
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.
**Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.**
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.

*credit* cards allow you to spend *credit.* that is, creditors allow you to rack up debt and charges you interest on any remaining balance after a monthly cycle. if you accrue 15,000 USD in debt but you only have 12,000 USD to pay towards your statement, you will have to pay interest (usually around 30%!!!) on the outstanding balance. debt spirals out of control when you can no longer pay off the card because you are spending money you don't have saved elsewhere.
With BTC, you can only spend what you have saved in an account. Think of it more like cash than credit. You could still gamble it all away but at least at the end of the night you've only lost money you already had rather than money that someone lent you.

We'll just have to wait and see. 
Unrelated but I'm a newbie here...how do you quote other comments with that way? I can't find it in the formatting help table.

It's just strange (and a bit quixotic) to consider a thought-experiment where bitcoin has become the default payment method and then to further consider how people in general will respond fiscally...
"It sounds crazy it does, but I feel people will spend more not needing to do the extra step, with verifying their ID and everything."
People as a whole or proportional to an individuals spending before/after btc adoption?
When bitcoin becomes easier for the masses to use than CC/cash/checks, I think a deflationary currency fuels saving more than its ease of use provokes spending. Why do you think people who currently spend less strictly due to the barriers imposed by CC are likely to spend more in bitcoin?

I like these numbers, but I can't trust 'em for shite.

Stay calm, everyone. STAY FUCKING CALM!

So I could lend my bitcoin and guarantee interest (profit)? Who is developing these contracts?
Or, is there a place where I can "borrow" bitcoin now?

Cool. They should survey the 92% for how many know-of/use/would-use digital currency instead-of/along-with banks.
Currently holding more cash than I would during a boom, but the market is receding again. Perhaps due to the unprecedented liquidity shock the US government deployed after 2008.
Here's my unsolicited prediction;
I'm prepping for a major correction. Even bonds felt the tremors in February! DOW breaks 26k?  ~24k currently. I see a bull-trap. The next free-fall is going to put 16-Sept'08 to shame. The collapse will be great for Bitcoin. It's just gonna send it.

how did you determine your goal amount?

absolute and unequivocal statements like this are not substantive to a balanced discussion on privacy and security. of course society can be governed without absolute surveillance. haphazard willingness to sacrifice privacy in exchange for a sense of security is desperate and improvident. blind faith in government to responsibly utilize and secure the "backdoor keys" is naive. cool it hawk!
