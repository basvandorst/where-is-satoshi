i haven't seen this during past dumps, their servers can easily handle that, there must be something else that caused this.
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:06:05
so stupid it might actually work
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:16:29
anyway, give us a complete list will all bids

reminds me of this:
@_date: 2014-07-04 11:08:12
this was posted 3 dozen times already, first on monday, we already know.....
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:41:33
lets just say us normal investors don't know whats up. i'm pretty sure big whales know exaclty what will happen.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:42:10
quickcoin is still in beta.......no support, rotating btc adresses. this will be a PR desaster for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:39:56
some people like the flexibility of web-wallets. carrying around a paper wallet when you travel is risky if the TSA for example searches through your luggage. you always have to decide between certain features.
@_date: 2014-10-31 06:33:39
fuck schäuble. he talks so much bullshit it hurts your ears.
@_date: 2014-06-09 13:05:48
so wuat? you can buy guns with bitcoins in europe too. took me 10 minutes to find a bitcoin gun shop....
srsly, you can buy anything with bitcoins, two more years and kim yong uncool will sell nukes on alibaba for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:03:39
if your bank goxes, your fucked. if bitcoin fails, your fucked. if fiat fails, your fucked.
see the problem? you have to trust somebody. bitfinex made an audit. when they implement multisig in next month they will become the leading exchange.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:21:00
shit shit shit where did i pust the key.....
@_date: 2014-07-02 08:04:38
could you please repeat how the btc were stolen? bitcoin trojan? was your wallet encrypted?
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:21:18
well bitcoin miners have enough computing power to do some bad stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:17:28
how can bitcoin survive if single pools have more than 50% hashpoewer? woudln't it scare possible investors that some people have the power to manipulate the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:32:57
why not 3-2? two for me and one for you? one shorter brainpassphrase and longer one in a safe. sounds way handier to me.
@_date: 2014-05-28 10:31:09
finals i think
@_date: 2014-05-30 07:11:43
why do you invest 150k fiat into one single company? should have bought from different devs, reduces risk and can still mine even if some don't come.
@_date: 2014-10-26 10:11:51
why not bury it in bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:45:18
i feel sorry for your bad childhood.
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:56:32
yes, because of gox many coins are simply gone or held by keppler, people lost their money and won't invest anymore
@_date: 2014-05-06 10:50:13
yes, but have you see anyone avertising dollars, euros or yuan?? thats suggests that bitcoin is a product, not more or less. nascar was pretty cool, but how should ufc work? it costs a lot of money, and unlike nascar the logo isn't so visible.
@_date: 2014-07-04 07:13:10
yeah, and also 4 times 0x ......

@_date: 2014-07-01 05:45:13
so, what was the winning bid after all?
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:18:54
finex is good, offer 2,5:1 at 13%
@_date: 2014-05-06 06:21:22
we are still above this years all time low which was almost one month ago, it went down to 350 i think, so theres still space down there. actually 420 was a stable level before china fud. people are waiting for what will happen on sautrday, 10th may, the pboc dealine expires then. maybe it will go up, maybe not.
btw, the glass is always full ;)
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:14:15
this post doesn't make sense at all
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:37:58
@_date: 2014-06-30 15:44:31
sounds legit
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:11:50
yeah, then you could compare it to simbabwe dollar. people are stupid. they want bitcoin as a currency, but also want it to rise into infinity. that won't work, you have to choose between currency and investment, not both.
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:30:05
its nice, but not as good as bitcoin wisdom. i need more than one exchange, bitcoin is global. at something like this:
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:11:50
but that doesn't mean paypal couldn't use btc to their payment, to make it look like it belongs to paypal.
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:16:15
but at 900$ they said. it will be a good investment they said.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:50:34

@_date: 2014-05-22 05:31:06
silly you, i bailed out at 900 :)

lets hope so

High Yield Investment Programm. google it if you want to understand. if not, its a kind of ponzi sheme
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:10:34
yeah, try to pay with bitcoin at wallmart. fidor is very important to make bitcoin mainstream, they have very good service and many many features.
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:26:26
yeah, but why did they have to use market order for closing? ;(
@_date: 2014-05-06 08:17:02
goodgood, let the butthurt flow through them
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:01:07
thats very likely. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 19:54:00
well, bitcoin has computing power and math behind it. what would you rather trust, math or the US mint?
@_date: 2014-06-07 12:22:18
haha, don't complain about something that you don't understand. the maximum deposit igf 50k, double accounts will be frozen(if you stupid enough). of course it won't work forever, its a hyip, everyone will get out after the 120day limit. inform yourself before writing bullshit. ponzi or not, as long as i get my money they can do whatever they want.
@_date: 2014-05-09 13:02:10
like diz. we should make a keppler award for the most stupid and risky innovation/product of the year
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:30:33
well its pretty clear that big investors don't buy online, but from miners directly. and they have fixed prices(maybe they hedged their btc purchases a few month ago and are fucked now?) its impossible to buy more than 1000 btc on any exchange without increasing the price.
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:15:25
yeah, anyone can claim to have information. don't trust this people
@_date: 2014-06-27 07:05:30

@_date: 2014-05-02 21:01:59

but you must agree that china is getting less and less important, if everyone stops reportinmg about china, and ignores them, as hard as it may be, we could get rid of china till the end of the year. india has almost same amount if people, and would be a good market too.

is this a real bot or just some nerds?

yes thats possible, it automatically converts your btc into usd when margin trading. but better switch itr by your own

if bnp paribas can pay 9 billion $ fine, they can find someone who takes care of this. if a bank really sees itself threantend by bitcoin, it will take action.

*lol... it's a currency.... "big investors" won't buy an asset that could be so easily manipulated, because they know, "there's always a bigger fish". If they can manipulate it, someone with deeper pockets could do the same. If they're "big investors" they won't take that risk. *
exactly not. they buy because its easy tto manipulate. and no, there is not always a bigger fish, you can very exactly see which adress has how many coins.
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:05:53
people back then didn't exspect it to explode. everyone who buys now has clear goal and exspectations, and if they aren't fulfilled in the next month they will dump their coins

gox and china pushed 2013 pump, now both are more or less gone. many people have lost a lot of money. nobody will invest before they see clear signs that the downtrend is broken. some kind of placebo effect would be good, they are waitinf for the pump which they have to start.

you must be fun at parties. is it really that hard to see thats it meant sarcastic? actually it is a thought that many people have, at least in germany. the old ones steal the future of the young people. they can get pension from age 65, while the now-young will have to work at least till 70-75. our politics are actually killing of a whole generation, only to get the votes from the old guys, but forget that they will really die soon, and then everything is left in chaos. the system will collapse at some point, and then the older generations will get murderd.

@_date: 2014-05-12 05:22:13
how do you configure it? and we should speak to some blogs and reddit mods, to make some announcments to let people know how important it is.
@_date: 2014-07-05 15:37:30
then everything changed when the bitcoin nation attacked
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:19:21
pffff, why not? we could become a supermacy, imagine a polictal crypto party. such power.
@_date: 2014-07-04 09:35:02
why not localbitcoins? if you find a miner nearby you often get bitcoins with 2-3% discount, can pay with cash and recieve btc instantly. and no bank notices anything.
for trading finex is currently best, 0.1% fee, and if you trade enough you get 0.0%. and if you're not at home you can simply put them into swaps and receive 0.15% interest per day. if they increase their security they will become the leading exchange within this year for sure.

i would rather remeber dark market than open bazaar, its sounds more mystique, and such things attract people. the biggest competitor would be ebay, with paypal, so we'll see an epic showdown, Dark Market with Bitcoin vs. Ebay with paypal
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:25:43
price manipulation is a thing. even more when interests are colliding. big investors and Fonds want to buy cheap, while already holders want the price to go up (also including traders with long position). the price is which group has currently more power, which seems to be the buyers who still want a lower price (what happend with GABI, where are they getting their coins?)
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:50:09
ok, you may live. but that is really a bitcoin phenomen, that there are so many old people, normally internet buisiness is for youngsters...

-off-chain 0 fee transactions at multiple payment processors(to match the same processor as the merchant)
-reward system

-beautiful GUI
-android, ios, windows (phone), linux
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:13:54

imagine what would happen with 10 millionen transactions a day(what mastercard propably has, or at least close to). blockchain would cause more traffic then youtube.
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:31:45
they can make bitcoin an option within paypal itself. like you can choose btween debit card, paypal balance or bitcoin. that way they could still take fees for it. and thats actually whats not supposed to happen, paypal taking 2% again, so nothing changes. like the old speech: the more things change, the more they stay the same.

the reason why people invest in altcoins is because they are now at the stadium btc was 4 years ago. they exspect bigger rises from them than from btc(from now on). in you want to invest in crypto now, you would rather invest in cheap altcoins, where you can exspect 5x-10x rises, while btc is just like 2-4x max. altcoins rise almost exponential in contrary to bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-06-30 07:25:19
that the SR coin price must be above market price is clear, the question is how high. don't forget, the bidders themself know their bids, so they can use this information.
doesn't new miners cause lower prices? more hashpower means higher difficulty, which results in more centralization to the mining farms?

@_date: 2014-05-12 08:53:04
that it won't happen for reasons is clear, but investory are easy to frighten. you can't explain them complety. and their analysts will look for every weak point, and they will point this out for sure.
the failed block however will not be orphaned soon, nobody controlls his miner 24/7, they would keep mining until somebody notices it and warns them. in that time a lot of blocks will be found, however the damage would still be enourmus. but it still is kind of ironic that mining get centralized more and more. in a few years only half dozen pools will remain.
@_date: 2014-09-30 21:23:17
it is absolutly a bitcoin thing. with mesh networks bitcoin can reach every point of the planet, banning bitcoin would become even more ineffective. also it is more secure i guess if you can send bitcoins without actually connection to the internet or without internet access

no you can't. there are only around 1500 coins till 670. the more you want the higher the price gets. 30k btc would go around 1000$. thats what most people don't get, if it was cheaper on the exchange they would do it.

@_date: 2014-05-04 20:15:26
of course 95% of altcoins will fail, thats the risk. but if it wasn't true nobody would invest. people have high exspectations for them, and i don't see why shouldn't rise. some have really interresting features.

@_date: 2014-06-16 11:33:39
thats not great news. thats slightly interesting news. jeez stop these self advertisment, you're not the first and neither the last.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:50:57
it won't work, as soon as somebody buys, the worth increases, because the bids shrink while asks rises.
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:58:10
bailing out: panic selling :)

@_date: 2014-07-01 06:28:27
you the real mvp 
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:04:06
many people gave up. the bitcoin client is a full node too, right? or not?
@_date: 2014-06-30 06:18:57
i was long since 570 and sold at 619, i'm quite happy. i may go long later, but for now its a risk, 60/40 that it falls back to 600 before marshal news hits.
@_date: 2014-05-07 05:19:22
do you have a link to there website? can't fand them.
@_date: 2014-10-07 09:49:57
i think this has never been more relevant:
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:02:02
no, gox doesn't have any coins in their wallets any more.
@_date: 2014-06-12 03:09:40
no, if everyone waits for it to happen it can't happen. market psycho shit.
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:35:28
dude that was a joke, i only go short. better get into altcoins, ltc, nmc, ppc, bc, drc are way better bitches than btc
@_date: 2014-05-01 09:17:56

@_date: 2014-07-04 07:04:00
don't count in years, count in blocks. it could be a new time measurement
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:59:13

@_date: 2014-05-08 07:49:27
good, let it be quick death for china. in few years the banks will be begging the exchanges to make an account at their bank
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:01:38
if you say so mr president
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:13:30
mining is to expencive for a hobby. not everyone has free energy. people should also run full nodes.
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:28:49
we can make future contract, offering 100 btc for 100.000.000$ by Nov 2015.
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:28:05
its not worth the energy any more.
@_date: 2014-07-03 05:44:54
bills yes, but not the electronic $, which makes 90-95% of all existing $. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 06:20:23
and how is btc any cheaper than CC or cash? 7-11 will use off chain transactions, f.e. when they use coinbase or bitpay accounts and give out bitcoin cards.

@_date: 2015-01-16 19:56:34
damn anal fuckers, ruining our economy.
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:31:50
maybe a little bit to early? in a few years this would be an interresting an idea, but what if bitcoin really fails? you would be screwed
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:56:47
maybe :) should go short 
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:45:32
Coinkite has already shipped their btc credit/debit cards....
@_date: 2015-03-16 07:46:14
I only use authy because it allows me to backup the tokens. googles 2fa has no such option, which means if you loose your phone your fucked.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:03:27
neither of them ;)
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:23:24
watch it to the end, he gets arrested at some point.
@_date: 2015-03-08 11:46:01
multisignature it is. not knowing anything is the best protection against eager border agents. this is how it looks like in real life:

@_date: 2015-02-11 23:57:11
yeah, journalism hit a new low point. its a perfect example for a biased article whoa authors did exactly zero research and just copied it from Reuters/DPA/interfax
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:11:05
the problem is nobody will notice it and it has no effect on the price.
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:16:38
how about a small and local charity? 
i have burrowing owls in my garden and these people deserve support.

@_date: 2015-02-11 20:25:20
german newspapers are going nuts over this, claiming that bitcoin is at the edge of collapsing. pretty funny though.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:10:38
