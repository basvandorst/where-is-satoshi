Blockcypher does offer an api that measure the confidence of transactions, that how unlikely a transaction is double spent. Once the level reaches a safe threshold (over 90%), then it is safe to say that the transaction will not be double spent and that usually take a few seconds on most transactions. So if a POS implement that API then it is possible to have quick transaction times.

They are using the same tactics used last December where fees rose to $50 on average.

Congestion continues today with there being over 20000 1 satoshi/b transactions.

There seems be some congestion on the network today, a lot of unconfirmed low fee transactions.

I imagine the text messaging bitcoin system being connected to a SPV service and people can request balances/send payments/request addresses using text commands. Another option is to develop an app that directly send commands to the SPV over the GSM network operated via a GUI.

Bitcoin is a protocol instead of a product. Going around advertising btc would be as strange as advertising SMTP protocol used by email systems.

Bitcoin will not affect the banking industry or the way people use money in that particular area to a large extent.

Yes, most sources of deanonymiziation comes from third party software flaws instead of the bitcoin network itself
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:35:10
But addresses along are not directly indicative of other user information. They are just a combination of characters.

I did some bitcoin paid freelancing last October, but then quit because fees are tremendous ($50). Now that avg. fees are below $3, I can finally return to doing jobs for bitcoins.

I envision is up to the user's discretion to setup confirmation as an in app setting.

I get paid in bitcoins so market don’t affect me as much as long as I get paid the right amount.
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:13:02
Speaking of Africa I think the usage of BTC can promote micro credit programs there because there are less hassle in using banks to deliver the money. This can potentially help more people get a start in their businesses or farms and lift them out of poverty.

I believe that percentage fees for accepting card payments are tyranny against merchants.
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:57:55
I forgot to mention that this model is also useful online for postpaid services and recurring payments. You do not have to load money into a service for the convenience recurring bills, minimizing risk of a company running off with funds.
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:29:46
it's like a paper wallet but in coin form
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:52:20
However, most people likely don't see Bitcoin as cash but rather a form of electronic payment they are used to.
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:56:48
The user in this case has the choice of funding and not funding the payment multisig wallet, thus consent of payment is given and withdrawn directly by the user. The payment provider here only acts as a gatekeeper that verifies the legitimacy of the merchant. Whereas with credit/debit payments consent of payment is granted by the bank not the user directly.
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:50:56
The last statement is exactly why Bitcoin hasn't been widely adopted. The "old-business" practices are what most people are used to. Directly introducing a new paradigm of business will simply intimidate everyday users.
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:36:53
If the address gets reused a lot, then it might be possible to analyze/guess some information about the user. However, most wallet software generate new addresses for each transaction, so it is still very anonymous.
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:02:21
For example, blockcypher's blockchain explorer api offers automatic billing for credit card users but Bitcoin users have to manually send a payment every month. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 01:37:53
One of the options is to generate large amounts of addresses/private keys via sites like bitaddress.org and load them into the site database. Every time a order is made a new address is displayed for users to pay. After payment is confirmed, goods are shipped. To access funds, sweep the private keys.

Yes, it can be done as an Ethereum contract
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:18:29
No, I mean they might still be using paper fiat currency or even barter trade.

Very interesting point about the GSM coverage. Never considered that before.

Judging from it being in the “Midwest” and that PNC are the only ATMs there at the school. In addition, the “sole competitor” is coin flip located in hometown pantry.

I agree very much with the title. I think most, if not all, peaceful movements that resulted in change are movements that the rich and powerful want. Otherwise, peaceful movements will not work.

I have been working on xbtfreelancer recently to pay for my prom. I’m gonna use a withdraw atm soon to get the cash for the dinner.

I won’t recommend coinbase to him. I would recommend reputable localbitcoins or paxful exchangers that accepts bank transfers.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:14:45
Whoops didn’t see it
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:39:41
There’s some mistakes in wording here. I meant to say peaceful demonstrations. This is because demonstrations are meant to appeal to the powerful and thus still up to the powerful’s will to make the changes. Bitcoin is different because people took action themselves.

PayPal's high fees is why it is not used prevalently in the first place. In China, Alipay and WeChat are very common for both in store and online payments. These two do not have transaction fees for the consumers and very low for the merchants.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:34:22
Fees are fixed and based on network conditions. So it’s a regressive fee system.

Speaking of robberies, the closest BTC atm to me is in a dangerous part of the town. I am debating whether to go there to withdraw my money or get the money mailed in on localbitcoins from a reputable vendor.

The wallet card will be a miniature credit card sized CPU device. It’s CPU does not need much except to handle the transaction generation and signature process. There are also 2 buttons and a small screen for confirming / declining transactions. Wallet data is stored on a solid state memory device. To use the card, it is to be inserted into a pos endpoint, much like how people use chip debit cards today. Power is transmitted via resonate coil and a rectifier is used to convert the alternating inducted current to usable DC current for the CPU. Wallet address data is read and an unsigned TX request is sent to the wallet card. The card now displays the TX amount onto its screen and ask the user to accept/decline transaction. If accepted, the card generates TX internally and transmits the transaction to the POS to be broadcasted.
@_date: 2018-04-22 02:19:36
I had a vision of people using credit card sized wallet cards to pay. A dapp based escrow will be used to ensure fairness.

That is absolutely false. Recently I have been paid in bitcoins to design and program database MYSQL systems. After I got paid, I headed right over to bitrefill to pay my phone bill with bitcoins.

For my computer science final project I made a simple android wallet and I’ll present it tomorrow. I want to make a point to people that Bitcoin is just as convenient to use as PayPal Zelle Venmo Visa etc but without expensive fees or delays for both parties of the transaction.

Its just a very simple wallet me and another student made only 2 weeks. You can load only 1 testnet address with its wif at a time for now. We used the blockcypher api to perform blockchain lookup and signing is done locally on the phone. It has a QR code of the wallet and you can scan other people's QR to send. Very simple but makes the point that you use Bitcoin just like any other payment app. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:14:54
withdraw to bank takes a day for most bank accounts unless you have a debit card that supports instant withdraw.

It’s time to bring down the Visa/Mastercard/Amex house. Percentage fees for merchants is simply tyranny in today’s world of cheap data transfers.

In the future I am going to create a buyer protection escrow service based entirely on multisig wallet and community based arbitration. This will address the lack of a reliable and transparent buyer protection mechanism for bitcoin.
