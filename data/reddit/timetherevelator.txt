Actually... this serves as a reason to stay with fiat. If your dog chews off a few digits on your paper wallet then your funds are lost. You're fucked. But if it chews off a corner of your $100 bill, or even chews it in half, you can bring in the remains to a bank (central authority) and they'll give you a brand new bill.
There are great reasons for blockchain tech, but this is not necessarily one of them.

If a government entity is breaking the laws of the nation, Republican or Democrat, they should be exposed. The fact that the media and the "public" turned on Assange the moment he exposed Hillary's corruption attests to the fact that they care less about fundamentals and more about short term partisan opportunism.

The very fact that you're even responding to this claim means it contains a degree of merit.

Rubin has said many many times that he’s a “classical liberal”. If you think that’s the same as conservatism I got a bridge to sell you.

Resonating with all the positive comments. Gray work. Small suggestion is to make the background lighter so as to have better contrast with the black text.

Interestingly, is still hanging around. Would love to hear his experience of being such early of an adopter.

When did you lose interest and why, if you don’t mind me asking?

This is the obligatory comment that cranberry juice is a safe and natural method to treat a UTI.

It’s not really money or cash. It’s more like gold. Cash is quick and easy to transact with in the real world. You just hand over some paper slips. Done. 
Bitcoin is more like gold. Just as gold is hard to move around, and is difficult for average people to price, so Bitcoins 20 minute settlement period and unwieldy private key system will *always* make it unusable for average people to transact with day to day for things like coffee and groceries. (The only way that changes is with trusted intermediaries who hold private keys, eg Coinbase app, but this sort of defeats the purpose of the entire coin). But like gold, Bitcoin is an excellent store of value. While gold has a 4000 year history of being valueable, Bitcoins digital nature gives it unique advantages.
