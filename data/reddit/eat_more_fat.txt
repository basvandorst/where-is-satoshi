That's the same hack as already linked, and I still think that's unlikely in the real world due to smudging and having to get the correct finger. In the hack they place a clean thumbprint on the phone and go from there. If they went to WWDC and checked through 100 phones, I wonder how many they could hack? The fact that it can be done in perfect conditions should perhaps warn you off of trusting it with your life savings, but for mobile wallet purposes I think it's pretty damn good.
I did pick this up:


Now that developers can access TouchID, we could also include an (optional?) PIN to access the wallet, or just to send money, or for more than a certain amount, etc.

Well, bad brainwallets are bad, and good brainwallets are hard. A good brainwallet needs to be long and have a series of words that has never appeared together, which leaves out any memorable saying or phrase you might like. Also, brainwallets are hard because you have no net -- if you forget your words you are out of luck. So then you will want to inscribe them somewhere, which then opens another attack vector.

I understand your point -- I got the feeling he's never been interviewed about Bitcoin and just isn't ready with the quick replies to the standard barrage of questions just yet. But he hit those points mentions above, which are all home runs and given his background and reach I think it's pretty amazing.  
The only thing I wish he'd change is the answer to 'what can you buy with bitcoin'? Use SnapCard? I'd rather an answer like, 'that isn't the most important factor just yet, but it is happening at a healthy, sustainable pace.'

Live booting isn't something the general population is going to find easy. Even when you do, you have to either create an image that has bitaddress.org on it or similar and then take the time to reboot every time you want a wallet. For some, this is fine, and this product probably doesn't fill a need for them. But even I could do the live distro pretty easily, but it's a pain and I'd much rather use a little widget like this. 
A printer isn't a bad idea, maybe look at the [PiperWallet]( for inspiration.

It's taking the hit now, I think it'll bottom out before breakfast (US time anyway). This is what people have been expecting and I think it was mostly already priced in over the last few days. I think it'll drop, bounce, then start back up as the world realizes that Mt. Gox != Bitcoin.

I'm planning on it whenever I get my asics from Black Arrow, but that'll be (hopefully) early March. I've been setting up a machine to run bitcoind and P2pool, so I hope it's still going. I can point my wee GPU machine at it, which I'll do anyway just to get the bugs out, but won't help the big picture much I'm afraid.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:52:07
TM could account for some or all missing coins due to Gox's incorrect way of recognizing transactions. But the transfers would have had to originate from Gox accounts, moving coins out: 
* Transfer coins out of Gox
* Munge transaction ID
* Claim coins never sent
* Gox sends more!
But, to my understanding, Gox only allowed verified account holders to transfer funds out. Perhaps some clever thieves doctored accounts, but I would think that one could work through all their backlog and find these double spends. Even if they couldn't be recovered, I would think the outputs could be identified, but maybe I'm delirious from sleep deprivation.

And after each bubble, the price stabilizes again, but at a higher level. I suspect we'll see this for another year or two. If you believe Bitcoin adoption will be exponential (eventually), the price will have to rise exponentially and that won't happen without a series of peaks and valleys. If you zoom out, it will look smooth, but in real time it is going to be a series of bubbles and plateaus.

M of n transactions are useful, as several people point out, to secure your keys. They are also useful for groups in that you can have, say, 5 people who each have a key and set up a fund that requires 3 of those keys to spend.

Awesome news! Especially considering some of the announcements at today's WWDC keynote:
* Developers can now access TouchID, the fingerprint sensor
* Extensions: now apps can interact with each other
There's a lot more, but these jumped out at me in relation to a Bitcoin wallet. TouchID is a very secure identity mechanism and can replace the need for passwords. Previously it was only available to unlock your phone or use the Apple App Store. Now developers can use it as well, so you could authenticate with that instead of a password.
Extensions allow developers to interact with other apps. For example, a Bitcoin wallet could interact with Safari, providing a seamless way to handle Bitcoin links and pay securely with your (TouchID protected) wallet.
There's a lot of interesting changes -- notifications now can take widgets, so you would put a price ticker and more in the Notification Center. 
There's also a brand new development language called Swift. It looks and develops like an interactive language, but is compiled and has performance characteristics better than Objective-C. 
Now I just need to quit my job and write me some Bitcoin apps!

Hey I'm a big fan and active user of BitGo, but this is disturbing:


Can you describe what you intend to patent about multi-signature technology? 
@_date: 2014-05-29 01:27:57
Exactly this. I use Coinbase and keep some varying amount that I use regularly. I use BitGo and have been slowly moving more into it (usually minutes after purchasing on Coinbase). I also have paper wallets (love my PiperWallet) with my bigger balances and an offline/online Armory wallet with some too. Dealing with wallets is/was a long/ongoing research project, but I expect it to get much simpler this year (year of multisig). Between BitGo, Greenaddress and other multisig web wallets and insured offerings such as Circle, I expect fewer and fewer new adopters to go through what we read in this post.

That seems like a really negative reading of the piece. There isn't any decision yet about what potential regulations might be. I mean, if you are anarchist, I suppose anything mentioned by any government reads like that, and maybe that's ok, but I think we still need a bridge to get us from here to a potential future where we can self-govern in a humane and responsible way.
On a more pragmatic level, I would think this might pave the way to acceptance of Bitcoin apps in the Apple App store, with any luck. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 05:34:36
I'm pretty sure the only actual regulation in China is from the RBOC stating that banks are not allowed to exchange bitcoins. They're legal to use, though, and merchants can accept them, but they couldn't deposit them to their bank. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:54:30
I would much rather be 'transporting' $50k in bitcoin than the same in cash -- regardless of customs declarations. If reasonably secured, the bitcoin is going to be a lot safer. I really don't know what more legal recourse you have with cash that you don't have with bitcoin. But with bitcoin, you can have a backup, you can have multi-sig, you can have it only in a brain wallet, etc. It can be totally unknown to anybody that you have access to a very liquid form of value exchange from anywhere.

Interesting read, thanks for the link. The video and article linked from that site do make it look a little easier, but still far from easy. One of the key requirements is to start with a perfect image of the fingerprint, which they did quite deliberately. In real life, prints are going to be a lot more smudged and you very well may not have a clear print of the one you use for TouchID. As the article I linked to above notes, you also have to know which finger is the key. You could have a variety of prints on the phone, but none of the pinky, for example. 
Still, I wouldn't go around with tens of thousands of dollars in my mobile phone wallet in any case, but I'd probably feel pretty comfortable with hundreds of dollars there. 
I'm looking forward to [Nymi]( and how secure that proves to be.

Very clear and concise, thanks! I mostly must hold long (and use it too), but dabble a little at btc-e and can see the market is pretty irrational, but still don't have a clear vision of exactly why.
 
I've been doing forex training since the fall, but no other real trading experience. Obviously bitcoin markets are pretty different than forex, especially in terms of volume and liquidity. To me, looking at the charts for bitcoin is almost non-sensical -- there just isn't enough long term history to make them meaningful and with the generally low volume, prices are pretty easy to manipulate (correct?). I see people talking about various patterns in the trollbox and how such-and-so is about to happen due to the whatever-pattern and I tend to figure either this person is trying to move the price. But am I wrong? 
I also don't know how people make money without the money management strategies available in forex -- limits and stops and having at least a 1:5 risk ratio, etc. Or am I missing something?

Actually I think the major exchanges -- Winkelvoss ETF,  SecondMarket and the like -- will do fine with this (I'd guess it's why the price is up today), but small players will flee.

Allaire was perfectly rational and even explained his views on regulation in ways that his detractors have skipped over here today, e.g., we don't need more, we need currently applicable laws to be clarified. Do we see that in the headline?

I'll definitely move some of my 401k over (if I can), and I'm wondering how valuable it will be to get into the ETF early. Will shares appreciate based on demand? Or is the price more tied to exchange rate? Guess I should read the prospectus...  
I suspect the one factor that may drive a quicker growth of this fund than the BIT is if it's easier for non-wealthy individuals to invest via their 401k.

Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it's pseudonymous. You can trace bitcoin as it moves from address to address, so you could potentially watch where the money went that you sent.
Transparency in government spending would still need to be developed on top of Bitcoin, however, but I do suspect some solutions will come. Some we may hardly envision yet, but some will likely look like smart contracts and autonomous organizations.

It's also a little more convenient to have your BTC in bite-sized chunks. You might want to load only $x into hot wallets, not your whole savings. My paper wallets I hope not to touch for some time and if the price goes up, might only want to load a coin or two at a time.

Ditto. I've seen a few posts here about Chase. I wonder how they pick and choose which accounts to close? I've run quite a bit into Coinbase as well, and have business, savings and checking accounts with Chase. Would be such a PITA to move everything, but I suppose a lot less hassle now than in OP's situation. Thanks for the heads-up!
Does anybody know if Wells Fargo is closing accounts? I do have a CU nearby also, but looking for options. I know WF had that meeting at the end of last year (or early this year?) about Bitcoin, so it seemed they might come out with a more reasonable policy.

@_date: 2014-03-10 05:52:38
This is a great explanation, but maybe one more detail (unless I'm missing it). If your 1Car address has 2 BTC and they are the result of a single transaction that sent you 2 BTC, then what you say is correct.
However, if you received the 2 BTC as 20 transactions of .1 BTC each, then you don't have the problem. You could send 1Truck 1 BTC and not need any change address because the input transactions would be consumed evenly.
Each address that has a balance has some incoming transactions. When you want to spend from that address, you can't spend part of any one of those incoming transactions. But if you have 20 incoming transactions, you could spend 10 of those and not have to wait for confirmations to send other payments. 
Each transaction always has to be consumed completely. If it isn't, then you get change.

This is because the movement of coins between internal Gox accounts took place off the blockchain, which is actually what allowed bitcoinbuilder to operate. If Gox had survived, you could have logged in to your account and moved your coins where you liked. It wasn't anything sinister in this case.

Great video and good to see the progress with multi-sig. 
I don't know if this would be feasible, but if Armory could add something like an address book and manage the movement of the signed transaction files from user to user that would seem to make this a lot more user friendly. Once the transaction is initiated by the first user, the others would get notifications and could sign and broadcast without having to email the transaction around. 
But as the OP says, this is early and only going to get easier.

I'd love to see your ideas as well. I think this is a fascinating idea, but there are some major design issues to create a solid implementation. First off is to understand the problem domain. I think the original post gave some general idea, but it's far from something you could start to code against.
Looking at your comments to that thread, it seems you have some ideas about voting. My belief though is for this project to work you will first need to tackle identity in a pretty substantial way. Possibly something building off [Namecoin]( [NameID]( [OneName]( [BitID]( or the like. However, none of these is complete -- this could be a topic of discussion for more than 30 days in itself, but some sort of confirmation of identity. The BetterMeans project looks great, but seems not to address this, and/or provides only a limited version and only a centralized version. (Though maybe I've missed it.)

There was some talk awhile back about a fund that was briefly offered -- I *think* through Fidelity, but not positive. While most folks made the observation that one should just buy coins instead, a fund like that would make it possible to direct some or all of your 401k holdings towards bitcoin without the penalties (though with the risk of course). I suspect we'll see those come back this year, hopefully before the price of BTC goes 10x.

Thanks for the clarification. I did create an offline key and used that, which I feel very confident with.
The hardest part was probably due to some learning curve for me to get a hold of the hex version of my public key. I use a Piper Wallet and it doesn't give you anything but the compressed public key by default. 
It took me quite some time to realize I couldn't get the hex version of the public key from the compressed version. (Downloaded and worked with pybtctools even.)
When I finally figured that out, I went back to the Piper and used the bitaddress.html  (offline) to get the hex versions from the private key. 
Maybe I'm lower than I thought on the learning curve, and maybe some of these things are inaccurate, but it might be worth a how-to somewhere to give folks a hand. 
Anyway, loving the site and ability to easily add watching wallets and my Coinbase acct. Looking forward to using the wallet -- thanks!

Ready to go?! They've arrived! I ordered a BeeBomb and HornetBomb on Friday and they were here waiting for me when I got home from work on Monday! 
And they're very good! BeeBomb is a jalapeno-based sauce, with quite a sweet tone from honey. It's got a nice little kick and is very unique. 
The HornetBomb packs a serious habanero punch! It also has the honey, but that's a little less evident, but there for sure. Nice taste and good kick to it. It also has a really fresh flavor, like it's right off the vine.
If you haven't had habanero based sauces, they're great because the pepper has a lot of kick, but also can provide a very good flavor. I first had them at a little cafe on a caribbean island and have been a fan ever since. A good one you can probably get locally is Melinda's. These are a lot more unique, but Melinda's will give you the idea (and is also excellent).

Kind of an odd set of selections, especially for 10 years out. Maybe he's playing it safe or trying not to freak out the nice entrepreneurs? 
If you look at what's going on this year with various blockchain technologies -- decentralized apps, Maidsafe, Ethereum, etc. -- and suppose that even 20% of those endeavors will move forward in some significant way, I think in 10 years it would be much more likely there isn't a Facebook, or at least not as we know it. 
Remittence businesses are even less likely to exist. Being 10 years out, the conversion to fiat may not be an issue -- keeping your value in crypto will likely be acceptable or possibly preferred. I suspect that even crypto-based money transfer services (bit-pesa, the Philippines folks, etc.) will be gone by then, replaced by pure wallet-wallet p2p transactions.

True, but I seem to recall reading that one challenge is that you may get valuations for a token that far exceed the underlying value of Bitcoin. The trouble then is that the token isn't properly secured as the value for securing bitcoin is less than the value for hacking the token. (I'm probably not stating that well...)  
E.g., if a company with a market cap of 20B was entirely traded on CounterParty, it would be economically viable to attack the Bitcoin network to gain ownership of the tokens. 
Personally I believe the value of bitcoin would rise with or ahead of the value of tokens riding on top of it, but I guess it's possible it wouldn't.

Thanks for a good explanation. I'm just trying to sort out a couple of minor points...
1. The difference between the 'cloud' key and the one stored by BitGo is that the cloud key is encrypted and BitGo never sees it unencrypted -- is that correct? Otherwise they are both stored by BitGo, but the user also has a copy of the cloud key?
2. I'm concerned about wallet-creation time. It appears that my two keys are created in the browser on a machine live on the Internet, correct? So if my machine is compromised at that time, bad news? I see that I can bring a cold key -- is that just the public key? So I can keep one (private key) completely offline, generated on an air-gapped machine?  If I do this, am I safe even if my machine has a keylogger, etc.?

I think some of the points made already are part of the reason, but I think the biggest is that Apple is planning a move into mobile payments itself. It has a huge collection of credit card accounts, a phone with working fingerprint scan and on-chip secure storage. With BLE and iBeacons it is positioned to jump into mobile wallets in a big way. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 04:08:21


I see this logic all the time, and I totally know it sucks, but it's flawed. For example, around 2000 I bought some Apple stock for about $20 a share. A few years later I sold it when I bought a house. Now it would be worth something like 30x that, but I can't say that my house cost that much. When I sold the stock, I converted it to USD at the value it currently held. To retrofit today's price on yesterday's transaction just doesn't work. 
I purchased some ASICS from Black Arrow and will see how it turns out. They cost $6k each and at the time I made the decision, bitcoin was worth about $1k each. So I'm in each machine for 6BTC -- that's what I could have purchased and held as an investment. (Since then, the price dipped into the 500s and some people say, 'I should have just bought at 500, then I'd have XBTC'. Cherry picking buys with 20/20 hindsight is flawed too.) 
If my machines can generate 6 or more BTC in their wee little lifetimes, I'll be ahead. But if not, I should have just purchased coins. But down the road if bitcoins are worth $20k it doesn't make the cost of my machines $120k. 
To eliminate this risk, replace the bitcoin you spend right away if you can. I like to spend it, to use it as currency, but also want to hold my investment, so I buy more at the same (or very similar) rate. This is tough for big purchases like this, but that's where you have to make the call and take the risk. I couldn't cover my machines, so spread the risk by purchasing some BTC and spending some USD on the miners. Down the road I may wish I had a.) bought more miners or, b.) bought more BTC, but I can't retool the equations with values that weren't present at the time the decisions were made.

The secure enclave stores the registered fingerprint information. The wallet developer has no access to it whatsoever.

I'm sorry, but this sounds like a horrible idea. The funding should go into a bucket and the developers should work against [a broadly stated goal]( and those with the most money should NOT have direct manipulation of the work.

What is the ultimate power that the Foundation has? They pay the core devs, but other than that? Are they mis-managing the development of the Bitcoin protocol? The proposal you make seems to imply WAY more power given to the wealthy. 
As to this:


Obviously there are a lot of groups we can point to who might want to damage Bitcoin:
* China
* Banking/Financial system
* NSA
When you say they will be hanged, I suspect you're getting at the ability for us to fork the blockchain and create a new currency. Do you think this will deter them? If they could do this right now, do you think Bitcoin would bounce back from that? If we all knew that they could then do that to Bitcoin 2.0 next month? 
Money = Development direction... well, I just can't see that being ok. Maybe I'm missing something though, and it's certainly worth a discussion.

Yes, it's excellent. I think a lot of clarity can be found if people stop thinking about 'moving' their coins around -- from wallet to wallet, cold storage to hot, etc. There they sit, buried in the blockchain sand and ownership pointers change from time to time.

That's an unfortunate experience. For what it may be worth, everything has been pretty smooth for me and I've stored a decent amount of bitcoin there.

Seems you may have it. If you watch the linked video, pause at 1:43 and you'll see the user has to accept a device profile from Avalonic with the associated precaution:






I do hope to hear something to the contrary, but it would seem you need to hand over control of your phone for this to work. On the one hand, I can't possibly imagine *anyone* accepting this so it seems like the authors must have something to mitigate this for users. However, in the video the screen is glossed over with "click accept two more times," which seems just a little fishy.
Maybe this is a POC and there's something else coming? I can't imagine what would be patentable or that anyone would think this alone would work...?

So the Bitcoin Foundation shouldn't have allowed Brock Pierce to be a candidate? If you would have a higher bar set, what would it look like? I think you would need something to this affect:
* No allegations of financial wrong-doing, proven or otherwise
* No allegations of questionable moral behavior, proven or otherwise
* No association with persons fitting the above 
I can see the case for 'looks like a duck, walks like a duck' mentality, but how are you going to institutionalize a filter to remove some people, but not others, based on rumors and allegations? Or do you want one (centralized) person to make the decision of which candidates to include?
Also, I find it pretty dubious that you can find no better forum to post your letter than pastebin. Hiding in the shadows flinging shit doesn't make you altogether credible.

Who needs who is a question that is really only about ego. Is the foundation good for Bitcoin? Yes, I think so. They employ a very capable chief scientist and provide legal counsel, marketing and yes, speak to organizations that want some sort of authority. 
The foundation isn't some aloof organization -- it'll set you back $25/year, or $250 lifetime, to join. Want a voice, to be on the board, decide who to hire? Join up. If not, no worries, but slamming them for doing work on behalf of Bitcoin is a little pointless.

Well, the NSA may or may not have access, but the new ability for developers to utilize TouchID doesn't impact that. As a developer I don't have any access to the fingerprint itself, just the result of the system's authentication of it. It's still stored in the secure enclave and developers still can't access that. Whether the TLAs have access or not, I won't argue, but it is unchanged from the past.

This CNN article has some good points about the ruling -- essentially that it is a wide net that may be used to go after big tax dodgers, but is unlikely to be used for regular users.


There are a few more quotes from a variety of individuals including former IRS agents to similar effect. I think in practice, we'll end up reporting our 'investment' coins as capital gain/loss and ignoring the daily transactions. But I suppose time will tell.
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:52:03
Coinbase always seems to have some cushion built in -- the rate always seems a little higher than Bitstamp -- something like Bitstamp +$5. If Circle can eliminate that 1% fee and put the cost closer to the exchange rate, they'll get a whole lot of business I think. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:14:29
I'm a little curious about the economics - the article mentions that 100GB will cost less than a couple bucks a year. So if I'm renting HD space, I'm looking to make maybe $10 a year per TB? Or maybe those numbers are a little off, but if the general idea of Storj is that space will be very cheap, then it seems to follow that providing space isn't going to pay much.
Maybe it still makes sense just since I would want to store my own data, but the headache of running another app, port forwarding my router, etc., seems like it might make running a node more of a pain in the ass than it's worth...?
I'm also a little curious about the value of the coin, basically along the same lines. I guess if fewer people are providing storage then the coin becomes more valuable since they would buy it to get storage. But in that case, the system is tending towards more centralized systems, similar to Bitcoin mining. If most people run a node in exchange for coin and turn that around to get their own storage then the coin as a token doesn't seem to need to have much value, does it?
I'm very interested and hopeful on this and similar projects, and maybe just don't have my head wrapped around it yet. Or maybe some of this will need to shake out in the next couple years....?

This is what I was thinking too. You could have a BitTruck (BitWagon, BitBus?) and fire up localbitcoins, mycelium local trader and maybe even have an onboard ATM and frequent food truck locations. You could probably also go to farmers markets and the like too. You could help any trucks accept Bitcoin, provide flyers, a kiosk, etc. 
I think your point about regulations might be the biggest challenge. You'd need to figure out how to not get labeled as a money transmitter somehow I think.

That's a good point, they could secure their coin pretty easily most likely. Below you mention their Facebook credits -- I wonder if the challenge might be for them to create a currency that was valuable outside of Facebook? If it's centrally secured and issued by Facebook I can't see it having much life in the wild. If Facebook is mining it and issuing it, you're most likely that much worse off than using fiat?

Maybe, but it looks like there's more than 1 BTC donated so far. Why would you turn that off, what is the cost or other reason? Do you suppose he thinks that people would have donated more in cash or PayPal or something? It seems odd to turn away more or less free money.

No scoffing here, this is a huge problem right now. I do store some coins at Coinbase, but more at BitGo.com. It provides more security and you have the control of having the private keys, but not nearly as tricky as the submarine route.

@_date: 2014-07-21 20:29:42
I could certainly be wrong, but I don't think there can really be a BIP for this. If we stick with the IP analogy, the IP layer doesn't know anything about what rides on top of it. Similarly, Bitcoin as a protocol wouldn't be able to know the mappings to higher level services like this. 
I thought it was a great article, just a little hesitant about the centralized trust providers. Maybe that's an intermediate step prior to development of decentralized trust systems. When reading today, I can't help think 'Coinbase' or 'Circle' every time he mentions the gateways, and Coinbase does provide [easy payment addresses]( already. It will be interesting to see what develops in the coming year.

I'd be all for it, and it may be very easy, very soon. If you have a machine that can run [the new 5.2 DSM beta]( it has Docker support. If you search the Docker repository, you'll see [many Bitcoin containers]( It may take some tweaking, but I'd guess we can use one either as-is or with some minor modifications and be good to go.
In fact, [Docker]( is a great tool and I think promotion of the images there as an easy way to run a node would probably be worthwhile.
