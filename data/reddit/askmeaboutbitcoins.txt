So your saying you like peddos. Well your probably a peddo. I got those coins and if I didn't someone else would of cos the guy is and idiot. I'm talking about giving bitcoin a good name and the only way to do it is keep the rifraf out

We need more uptake to force people in. The changetip guys are doing a great job too.
The future is really in the dark net markets. I can see the day coming when everyone will buy their drugs with bitcoin and buying on the street will be looked at as the dark ages.
Any publicity is good publicity so even the scammers are actually helping bitcoin. I have been working on some scams myself. Just small amounts but it gets people's interest. Last week I was able to get this guys private key off him (he's a dumbass). I got 1.5 bitcoins and then he bought more to replace them so a win-win situation for bitcoin and me

It's worth paying more in order to increase acceptance. I am willing to pay 20% more if it gets more users. The 20% now is nothing compared to what the value of Bitcoin will be in 5 years time. We are on track to have the price hit $30,000 by the end of 2015. I have borrowed heavily at more than 20% interest to increase my holding. The interest will be insignificant in a few years time. All of us with 10 or more BTC will be flying around in private jets and living in luxury but we need to stick together and hodl.

If we can't take the coins after then don't let them buy them in the first place. We need to make sure eg gays/peddos can't get coins then which maybe difficult. If we have Bitcoin police they can check there record before allowing to buy. This will stop Bitcoin getting a bad name. The bitcoin foundation needs to work on this

One satoshi is going to be worth thousands of dollars in the future. No need for changing it
