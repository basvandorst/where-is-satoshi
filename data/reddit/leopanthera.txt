There's no such thing as insider trading for unregulated securities. Only Coinbase's dollar reserves are regulated.

Bitcoin had the opportunity to solve scaling and passed. It's too late now. If Bitcoin survives, it will not be as a currency. The forks can take care of that.

Hey bro, I'm literally telling you the dictionary English definition of "Insider trading". You can call it what you want but that doesn't make it illegal.

OK but you're redefining "insider trading" at this point, which specifically refers to the illegal practice.

The fee is far too small, and the inputs look really weird, I don't understand why the same addresses is listed multiple times.
If the output is less than 0.01, a fee is required, typically 0.0001 BTC.
It will expire eventually. Make the same transaction again with a more suitable fee.

SpiderOak is closed source, and is therefore no more or less secure than Dropbox. It is impossible to prove the security of any closed source system.

That's worrying, and makes me not at all surprised you lost money. The most basic rule of bitcoin security is to keep your own coins - not leave them in an online wallet.
If you are not the only person holding your private keys, you are asking for trouble.

If I was going to use a centralized service like this I would probably choose Keybase. (In fact, I [did choose Keybase](
It uses already-understood cryptographic proofs (i.e. GPG) and also encourages GPG use for email too. It's also trustless, all proofs can be verified by the end user should they so desire.
But in the long run I'm not convinced this is a real problem. You don't want to permanently associate an address with a user - addresses are supposed to be single-use.

It is true that transactions can sometimes take tens of minutes to become confirmed. Despite this, retailers can accept unconfirmed transactions with very little risk by simply 'listening' on the network for a double-spend transaction, or partnering with a company that provides this service. After a head start of merely several seconds, the original transaction would reach so much of the Bitcoin network that a fraudulent double-spend transaction would almost certainly be fruitless. An attacker would have to commit easily-detectable fraud, in person, several hundred or several thousand times, before one of these low-value double-spend attempts would likely succeed.
An attacker could work around the necessity of sending out a second fraudulent transaction to the Bitcoin network by attempting to solo-mine an attack block containing the attack transaction himself - temporarily withholding the block with the rest of the network - and then execute the fraudulent purchase within seconds, or minutes at most, of mining the attack block, before broadcasting the attack block. However, the cost of such an activity would dramatically outweigh the value of anything typically offered without a confirmation wait for several reasons.
First, mining a block (attack or otherwise) entitles the miner to a valuable block reward, and because the attack involves temporarily withholding the block from the network, the attacker would put himself in the likely position of his block becoming stale, which would result in forfeiture of the entire reward. Most solo miners solve less than one block per month, so this would represent the loss of proceeds of potentially several weeks of mining.
Second, it is not possible for a solo miner to know exactly when his mining activity will yield a block, and because the attack must be carried out within seconds or minutes of successfully mining a block, the attacker will not be able to know or plan in advance the brief window when the attack would be likely to succeed. While it may be easy for a determined attacker to get low-value items that are sold and delivered online instantly without waiting for confirmations (such as downloads), this unpredictability and the briefness of the opportunity would make it extremely difficult to commit any kind of fraud where real-life interaction is required, such as visiting a merchant or taking possession of goods. Petty shoplifting would be far simpler. Even if an attacker went forward with this attack, the retailer would be notified of the fraud the moment the attack block is released seconds later.
In short, the 10-minute wait for confirmation is only practically necessary when delivering goods of value that significantly exceed the block reward an attacker would have to risk to perform an attack and where recourse after delivery is practically nonexistent, such as money transfers.

The difficulty is dynamically adjusted to ensure that blocks are generated, on average, once every 10 minutes. This prevents new coins from being mined too quickly, or too slowly.

The problem with SpiderOak is that the client is closed-source.
With closed source software, you need to have 100% trust in the vendor because there's nothing except for their morality in the way of them leaking your personal information.

Your fee is hilariously low, so miners are probably ignoring it. Wait for miners who accept zero-free transactions to generate some blocks and it will go through.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:09:16
You didn't include a fee. The network is really busy right now, so your transaction may not get picked up for a couple of days, if ever.
They expire after 3ish days. If it expires, try again, and include a fee.

Litecoin is a "fork" of Bitcoin, based on the original source code but with modifications.
Litecoin offers three key differences from Bitcoin:
* The Litecoin network aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes, which its developers claim allows for faster transaction confirmation.
* Litecoin uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm: a sequential memory-hard function first conceived by Colin Percival. The original intended benefit of using scrypt was to avoid giving advantage to GPU, FPGA and ASIC miners over CPU miners, which occurs in the Bitcoin protocol. However, this turned out to be an incorrect assumption: GPU mining in Litecoin's implementation of scrypt is currently ten times more efficient than CPU mining. FPGA and ASIC implementations are more expensive to create for scrypt than for SHA-256, which is used in the Bitcoin protocol.
* The Litecoin network will produce 84 million litecoins, or four times as many currency units as will be issued by the Bitcoin network.
The prices of the two currencies are not linked in any way, except that decided by the market, exactly the same as the price of BTC in $.

Many miners will not include zero-fee transactions in a block, but some will, so you have to wait for one of those to generate a block. Obviously the time this takes cannot be predicted, and the number of miners accepting zero-fee blocks is falling. It sometimes takes up to 3 days. (At which point unconfirmed transactions usually expire.)

One Bitcoin is divisible down to eight decimal places. There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) maximum possible atomic units in the bitcoin design.
The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. In other words, each is divisible by up to 10^8.
As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grows too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people can start dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).
There being fewer bitcoins remaining is not a problem for the currency itself. If you lose your coins, all other coins will go up in value a little. Consider it a donation to all other bitcoin users.
A related question is: Why don't we have a mechanism to replace lost coins? The answer is that it is impossible to distinguish between a 'lost' coin and one that is simply sitting unused in someone's wallet.

At very high transaction rates each block can be over half a gigabyte in size.
It is not required for most fully validating nodes to store the entire chain. In Satoshi's paper he describes "pruning", a way to delete unnecessary data about transactions that are fully spent. This reduces the amount of data that is needed for a fully validating node to be only the size of the current unspent output size, plus some additional data that is needed to handle re-orgs.
As of October 2012 (block 203258) there have been 7,979,231 transactions, however the size of the unspent output set is less than 100MiB, which is small enough to easily fit in RAM for even quite old computers.
Only a small number of archival nodes need to store the full chain going back to the genesis block. These nodes can be used to bootstrap new fully validating nodes from scratch but are otherwise unnecessary.
The primary limiting factor in Bitcoin's performance is disk seeks once the unspent transaction output set stops fitting in memory. It is quite possible that the set will always fit in memory on dedicated server class machines, if hardware advances faster than Bitcoin usage does.

Pay your bills before you worry about savings. Basic money management, whatever currency it's in.

Current market price is $131 AUD, so good luck with that. (You will pay a small premium to make it worthwhile for whoever sells you the coins.)

Well thank you, I was more concerned for the health of the bot than the health of my wallet balance!

Miners don't matter. Investors don't either. Consumers and retailers will decide whether a digital currency lives or dies, and BTC has an insurmountable first-mover advantage. It's only a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:25:06
The fee is decided by you. Miners can choose to ignore zero-fee transactions but they have no incentive to ignore transactions with any fee &gt;0. The fees are what will cause people to want to continue mining when the block reward reaches zero.
tl;dr The mechanism to keep them reasonable is you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:31:45


For free? None. None at all.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:27:45
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:29:49
The network is very busy at the moment. No-one can predict future block generation times.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:24:36
Mining is no longer profitable. Just buy some.
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:34:04
I can't imagine what difference it would make. I always prefer to use a local wallet where possible.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:08:16
Server problems. Fixed shortly.
@_date: 2013-05-13 23:56:23
Yes. So far the money supply has increased at about the same rate as the number of people holding coins.

[Question 5](
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:04:48
Of course it is. They don't even have a valid SSL certificate.
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:06:08
Why not? If someone cracks it then I'll know I need a better password. But I bet I don't.

It's supposed to be, but Zurker could take control at any moment. You wouldn't necessarily even know.


No, it can't.

Bitcoin transactions cannot be cancelled or reversed.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:06:49
Regulated by who? Bitcoin does not care for international borders. The US can make it illegal for all the rest of the world cares, it will carry on regardless everywhere else.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:41:36
Yeah sorry, I was thinking of the master private key, which I don't think it will show you at all. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:57:02
Do you have the transaction ID?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:19:30
Then you have bigger problems and I cannot help you. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:03:07
No we need the Bitcoin transaction ID to be able to look up what's happening.
It's a long string that looks like this:

Fuck this noise.
Not only are you spamming your gambling site, but your gambling site *encourages spamming*. From the site:


No. Fuck you. And stop spamming.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:20
Yep, no fee. If you're lucky you will get a confirmation in 24 hours or so.
Next time include a fee. 0.0002 is enough.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:36:45
Brave, if nothing else.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:25:51
I disagree. I've been having slow confirmations for 24 hours now. Something is definitely screwy with the network.
It's working, but it's slow.
@_date: 2013-05-11 12:28:24
Ah right. Then yes, that's absolutely true. If you're buying physical objects, then PayPal is arguably safer.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:22:56
In the Blockchain.info wallet do a Custom Send and there is a separate box for a fee. 0.0002 is enough.
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:14:45
The numbers of miners always drops a bit when the difficulty goes up. Historically new miners have always appeared (Or re-appeared) before the next difficulty correction.

From my own [Bitcoin for Beginners](


@_date: 2013-11-19 01:56:09
I buy my coins from BitStamp. I store them in Electrum.
BitStamp is no use to you if you are American. It is a European exchange.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:37:48
Electrum allows you to turn "Use change addresses" off, which means your balance will stay on the same address unless you manually move it.
I like Electrum, I think it's the best client for bitcoin newbies.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:35:13
I think the future of BitCoin clients are those which do not need to download the entire blockchain, such as Electrum (which I personally recommend) that uses a public server to handle the blockchain for you, or MultiBit that uses SPV and therefore doesn't need the complete chain.
Electrum can import the private keys of your old client, so if you're looking to switch, that might be a good client to try.

Christ, calm down. He's 10 minutes over his average and suddenly you're posting on Reddit?
Give the guy a break. If he's vanished then wait for escrow.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:17:36
You can check the confirmations from wherever you sent it, rather than relying on BitStamp.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:33:24
Cool story bro.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:30:48
Carbonwallet doesn't work like that. Your keys are not transmitted to the server. They didn't steal your coins and frankly you're being a bit of a dick.
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:52:46
Change is automatically returned to you by the network.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:54:38
Citation needed?
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:43:11
That looks really odd. Do they order it for you? I would be so incredibly suspicious.
Why not just use Gyft to convert your bitcoins into an Amazon gift card, and then you can buy it yourself?
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:04:19
This is a scam
@_date: 2013-07-28 11:47:34
Eh? I just looked in the store, and it's still there.
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:24:47
The short answer is: You can't buy bitcoins with a credit card.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:01:23
Honestly, the mechanics of bitcoin are complex. The Bitcoin wiki is your best bet for detailed explanations but it is not necessary to understand them.
The simple version is mining requires expensive hardware and will most likely never be profitable to anyone except large companies ever again. But you don't need to worry about it. You don't need to mine to use Bitcoin. Most people never will.
@_date: 2013-07-27 23:47:27
That seems like an arbitrary distinction. I use it to send bitcoins. Therefore it works.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:25:53
As an exchange. Personally I feel uncomfortable keeping significant amounts of bitcoin in an online wallet, but if you're going to, Blockchain is probably the best one. But for the love of god, pick a long password.
Personally my favourite wallet is Electrum.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:16:41
If you are scared (and I would be too), remember that you can invest in things other than bitcoin. Selling them all and investing in the stockmarket means your funds will continue to grow.
I am not a financial advisor. You should talk to someone who is.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:16:20
Blockchain is certainly more widely used and reputable. CoinJar may well be just as good, but it is the newer of the two.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:09:53
Another bitcoin fork? Yawn.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:29:53
I believe in Bitcoin but I also live in the real world. Harassing CS agents isn't going to accomplish much.

We need to stop posting articles from that joke of a site.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:59:54
Possible, I suppose. If you're super paranoid, use an offline wallet. Make sure your OS and antivirus are up to date. And don't go to dodgy websites.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:56:02
We do? Regularly used in QR codes. I see it quite often.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:23:07
0.0002 is fine. The network is busy right now - it'll show up soon.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:48:52
Currency exchange would become peer-to-peer, just like the network. I've been using BitCoin and I've never used an exchange. Exchange coins for goods and services, and exchange currency [locally](
No problem.

Bitcoin does not use SHA-1
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:25:32
After making your Electrum wallet, simply send your entire balance to one of the new Electrum addresses.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:10:06
Did you not include a transaction fee?
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:44:44
I'll give the exact length if no-one gets it in a few days, but it's not crazy long.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:28:10
When [this graph]( goes above zero, but even then, only if you're willing to buy expensive ASIC mining hardware and then wait for you to get the cost of the miner back.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:10:49
There are no transactions in the network for that address.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:08:14
Maybe they need the money now? Some things you can't buy with bitcoins.
