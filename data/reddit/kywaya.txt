This video makes me sick :( i had opportunity to buy some early 2011 but because of the bank fees i didn't bought any ... losing a once in a lifetime opportunity make me sick everytime i think about it.
The worst thing is that a friend poker player bought some because he didn't care about bank fees, i didn't heard about him since 2013 ... last news from other friends : he leaved europe  to go abroad living the "good life".
All theses first investors were mostly gamblers and did not really saw the potential, except a few person, most of people just cashed out  in 2013 or 2017 and spend their fake fiat money .... most of them don't care at all about current banking system and how everything is working right now : they don't want to change that, just enjoy their OWN life and others can go in hell.  
This lack of empathy and selfishness from most of people in this area still keep me away from Bitcoin : what is the purpose of a great money system if most is owned by gamblers/crypto traders/selfishs persons ? they won't change ANYTHING except they will consume more and more and more, never enough to be satisfied.

Best way to keep crypto is BIP39, 12, 24 words engraved in metal or another material and that's it.

She read the number plate "Oi Bitch" ? \^\^ ahah we are  still far away from mass adoption. We need 20 years more for mass adoption by the new generation. "Old" people won't adapt to this new money ever (maybe if FIAT collapse they will start by force otherwise i don't see mass adoption by people of 40+ who are not in IT)
