The foundation of banks today is the magic ability to create wealth through debts. This cannot be done with Bitcoin in the same way - where the money supply is strictly limited. No-one will ever file bankruptcy because they owe too much bitcoin because bitcoin cannot be "charged off" - and effectively made into nothing.

Self-destructive people always harm others.

Non self destructive people care enough about themselves to take responsibility and do what's right.  Self destructive people are challenged to care enough to overcome the lure of the easy road.

The honest answer is "it depends". If you're in the United States, and are considered a citizen - then you can bet that the IRS is expecting something. Legally speaking - it's currently treated as a commodity, so you're supposed to pay taxes as a commodity on "the gains" - that is, as I read it "when you cash out to dollars". If you never cash out to dollars - no taxes.  I'm also looking into putting them into a ROTH IRA - which apparently means no taxes when you cash out after retirement.  Then you're just betting that the US government and the custodian of the IRA will be around when you need it.

I'm trying out cloud mining.  Hash nest had this weird pacmic contract that runs for 120 days and pays you back investment plus profit.  Been running one for 30 days now.  Probably going to kick off another 1 or two.

I have spent decades trying to convince developers that the software is worthless if it isn't used. Some developers listen, and the product wins over millions... others don't, and the product dies.
The advantage Bitcoin has over most products is that the userbase is full of intelligent people who actually might jump in, and the code is open-source, so it's actually possible to do so.
Developers, anecdotally, are an eclectic, eccentric, esoteric, and intellectual bunch. They've grown up being the smartest kid in the room, and have developed synaptic firings that correspond to certain related expectations. Humility and compassion are painfully lacking from this crowd. That's why when I hire developers, I specifically look for these traits, because humility and compassion are gold in the software business. That's the difference between technical shit doing crazy amazing things impressing no-one but developers, and software that serves humans. 
 
The Ecosystem of bitcoin is beautiful, but people and politics can mess it up. Bitcoin attracts many kinds of people, but only 2 kinds of developers...humble and cocky. In this business there is no in-between.  Cocky developers destroy with arrogance and technicality. They're the rules-lawyers of the table-top games (like D&amp;D) - sucking all the fun out of the room. They're the statists of philosophical discussions - sucking all the freedom out of the room. They're the ones at Volkswagen who proposed the software cheat to the California emissions standards. They're the ones who say "...you can listen to me or not..." and hope you fail.  They're poisons to great projects - most especially when they think they're irreplaceable.
And unfortunately - it's true, they might be irreplaceable.  But personally I'd rather have a team of compassionate, humble mediocre developers serving users... than a team of cocky "... I know what's best..." awesome developers trying to control something that was systemically built NOT to be under ANY individual's control.
This kind of threat is unfortunately damaging, but also petty. It lacks vision, and will likely be a setback if they go through with it rather than learn or exercise humility and compassion... and become servants to humanity.
Personally - I would appeal to the developers that they see the war for what it is, and choose their enemies wisely. Don't make bitcoin users or fanatics your enemy. There are plenty of real enemies to choose from.

If you can find a way to produce extremely cheap or free energy (electricity) - please let me know. That seems to be the barrier to me. Declining ROI as systems get more powerful and less power hungry make it a big investment to get decent returns with any longevity at this point. I *do* have 4 cloud mining contracts running with various providers. Given the declining nature of returns, this seems to be the best option right now for the little guy.

I don't think Satoshi wanted to be an authority. I don't think he wants *any individual* to be an authority (with the value of things). I think the notion of authority is one of the core problems that Satoshi was hoping to eliminate through decentralization and consensus. So, therefore, I think there are many things wrong with looking to Satoshi as an authority - especially if he's just the "they" from whom we're trying to depart through financial exodus from fiat.

Well done! This is the kind of entrepreneurial enthusiasm that will slowly transition conditioned and distracted minds through the great exodus from fiat.

How can cloud miners have a say in this vote? Do we have to own the hardware? If we don't get a say - than we've effectively implemented a bitcoin republic - worse if the miners don't pay attention to the constituents, don't you think?

Yeah - it's coming. Can't say exactly where - but far too many are far too over-leveraged. Here in the US - The government insurer FDIC put bank derivatives in front of citizen deposits, so it's going to piss a lot of people off when the banks start dying, and people who thought their dollars were safe find them confiscated.

"He" (they) was/is (were/are) a multi-dimensional time-traveler charged with altering this course of humanity for the purpose of destroying the fundamental concentration of wealth and power that leads to the demise of humanity (in alternate realities).... fiat currency. He's (They've) physically left our timeline until it's necessary to return while still monitoring the feed... which probably isn't for another half-decade or so. 
Next time he returns it will be in a different form - and zero-point energy will be released to the public.  Then gravity control.  Probably successively over the next 150 years or so.

It's not about the blocks, it's about the hash-rate competition. I'm not making this up, it was on a letstalkbitcoin podcast. Peter Todd? They start off talking about how the guest (not sure if it was him or other) has been traveling to China investigating this issue. Definitely not absurd, imagine drilling in the same place for gold - not profitable right? similar metaphor.  Just carry the logic ... 1 miner with 100% of the hash rate - why? If they're running 100% why burn ALL that electricity just to ... what ...secure the network? What's absurd is carrying your counter logic to it's conclusion. They're going to increase the difficulty against THEMSELVES? THAT's absurd.

I always can appreciate a solid technical distinction, and I won't argue with your interpretation. However, I understood the question not from a technically "threatening" perspective, but a socio-economic perspective. I fully admit my own interpretation of the question may be flawed.

Don't forget there are HUGE interests at stake. These stakeholders would love to see bitcoin fail, and will do ANYTHING to make it happen. Psy-ops in the form of FUD is definitely not beyond these individuals.

If you have access to Shift Card + Coinbase, you can spend Coinbase bitcoin* everywhere Visa* is accepted.
* = Many people have understandable issues with these in this context - but it's working for me, and it seems like a reasonable "on-ramp" to bitcoin for the general public.
@_date: 2016-02-23 01:07:10
I heard it explained that once the miners are over a certain hash rate (28%?) that they are effectively competing against themselves, and lose money (through extra electricity expenditure). Therefore, they tweak their hash rate for maximum profit without causing self-destruction.

Ethereum isn't about the coin/token for those closest to it. It's about bringing a new species of freedom to the world of software. It's definitely NOT about attracting investors. It's about attracting CREATORS and INVENTORS - which it has done quite successfully. This is why Ethereum has more of a future than most alt-coins.

R3 is working for the banks. Bitcoin is working for everyone else. Ethereum is being used by R3, because it was available. R3 is a "threat" to bitcoin in the same way AT&amp;T was a "threat" to the internet. AT&amp;T wanted to control all emails (so did AOL, and NetZero), until they realized it was a stupid waste of time to try.
Let them have their walled garden, the rest of the world can casually leave them behind.

The title is misleading. I just watched it (at 1.5x speed) There is no direct mention of "bitcoin". It *is* a good breakdown of the economic ailments facing us. Bitcoin can be a key to some solutions, but he doesn't get into solutions. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:17:42
Seems like a classic see-saw of "productivity" vs "security". Generally speaking, in software development, as you increase the productivity side, you decrease the security... and vice versa. In this case - "productivity" = "capacity", and "security" = "decentralization" - IMHO. There is no authoritative end to this debate, philosophically. The "authoritative end" lies in feedback metrics and response triggers. We need good data, and clear rules as to how to respond to that data - and it needs to be as simple as a water faucet, or light switch.

Yes,  that's true,  but you're still competing against yourself for blocks.  At some point no matter how little your spending on electricity,  you're effectively spending electricity to make it more difficult on yourself more so than other competitors. There's math there.

All of this applies only if Developers of Bitcoin fall under the legal definitions as "Creators" or "Owners" of "Money Service Businesses". 
This would mean that the following must be proven in a court of law:
1) Bitcoin is definitively "Currency" or "cash (Money)" (there's a legal difference, exclusive of it's trade-ability for fiat, human bodies would be currency or cash if that's the case) Bitcoin is currently legally defined as a "Commodity" by the CFTC and "Property" by the IRS.
2) Developers of systems are - by default - "Creators" and/or "Owners" - and NOT just "Inventors" (That would raise HELL with the PATENT system!! I and many other developers would personally be due millions of un-received funds as an owner/creator of many profitable pieces of software in use today.)
3) Developers of Bitcoin are materially tied to the legally defined "Business" OR "non-bank financial institution" OR "non-depository provider of financial services" ( of "Transmitting" funds. No bitcoin developers that I know of have demonstrated the goal of "profit" as legally defined. ("...the gross proceeds of a business transaction less the costs of the transaction..."  Nor does Bitcoin hold up as an "institution", nor does bitcoin "provide" financial services - in nuance, other businesses "use" bitcoin as a "medium" to do so.
Daniel S. Friedberg is spreading FUD. We've got a LONG way to go before our legal system can even THINK about wrangling Bitcoin itself.  Oh they'll try, and many people will probably end up in jail. But that doesn't mean that will be the end of it - like the old guard thinks.
My recommendation - if you're touching Federal Reserve Notes at all ever, you're under their grasp and should probably play by their rules. If you can demonstrably separate it from the flow of your "business" - no worries *yet*.

Macromedia Flash was AWESOME!  .... until it wasn't anymore. I Watched (and participated) as the "game changer" of the web changed the game. Then the old, but ubiquitous JavaScript was "reborn" through jQuery, and Flash died a slow and painful death. Many "Flash" developers became "jQuery" developers, and the die-hards promoting Flex didn't see the writing on the wall. Now we have AngularJS, and Meteor, and NodeJS. 
We can all thank "Satoshi" for "his" great contribution to humanity, but we don't have to stop learning and experimenting. Grow *with* us, not against us, brother!
