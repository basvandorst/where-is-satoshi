Actually have personal experience with this, was present when a certain bitcoin company was served by the SEC. 
They walk up, ask you if you are the person they are looking for, announce they are opening an investigation and you owe them $25k if you cease and desist immediately. If you fight, it usually goes way up from there. 
Granted, they don't tell you they're going to do this before they show up, so there's definitely some time between start and discovery.

I know Mike has gotten a lot of flak lately, but this deserves reading, and a rebuttal from Peter if he hasn't already.
TL;DR; Mike Hearn argues RBF makes double spending easier, because it causes miners to prefer higher fee transactions, instead of the first transaction they hear about.

You are correct about their presence, but I think you may stop short of seeing their intentions. Some troll for sociopathic fun, but others do it for profit.

I've said this before, and I'll say it again until this stops happening. 
Only use mining pools that publish their shares! 
Shares are cryptographic proof that you are paid greater than or equal to what you are owed. It's the same way that proof of work proves votes for a blockchain. If a mining pool publishes their shares for a block you can know you are getting what you are owed. It's simple, they just publish a few hundred or thousand alphanumeric strings.
Your payout == your shares / total shares
If a mining pool doesn't publish their shares, you don't know what your correct payout is. Period. Stop letting the pools go fractional reserve. 
It's like a bug in the human brain, we keep falling for these tricks, fractional reserve mining, fractional reserve banking, commodities etfs. We seem to have trouble distinguishing between a symbol and the symbols referent. We don't eat menus, but we sure eat shit when someone puts the word "money" on it.

To grease the wheels of consensus, we need to create honourable ways for the opposition to change their mind. If consensus can only come from a very public figure of the community tucking tail and supplicating, it probably won't happen. If instead they can save face and continue to be well respected while changing their minds, then we have a chance at consensus. 
So basically we need to have a culture in which people can admit they were wrong without getting humiliated.
Just something to think about.

As Mike talks about in the article, this definition of "rational" can be grossly out of line with the commonplace usage of the term.

I'd like to think this thru to the end. Suppose I believe that banks or governments or some powerful party X wants to destroy/control/slow Bitcoin. I'll buy that. Let's examine the hypothesis here, that X is promoting larger blocks so the number of nodes goes down &lt;-- centralization :(
What happens then? Does X then throw up a ton of nodes so they can do Sybil attacks against users? If they are powerful, why would they need the number of nodes to go down to do this? Even if the number of nodes goes down, there's no viable way for them to prevent honest users from putting up nodes so they won't be able to do Sybil attacks with 100% accuracy regardless of how large the blocks are. This doesn't seem like an effective strategy to harm Bitcoin, especially since Sybil attacks with less than 100% accuracy are detectable and people would realize it was going on and put up more honest nodes. 
So maybe there's something else someone has in mind when they are worried about larger blocks. I'm all ears, but "centralization" as an idea only is not meaningful to me. Is having one blockchain "centralization"? Is having consensus "centralization"? Nature alternates between many and few, from electricity to sexual selection. Everything is centralized in some ways and distributed in other ways.

Hmm interesting idea. It assumes the bought shares were from a pool mining on the same block, tho. Still could happen.
At the very least publishing shares would mitigate somewhat, as abusing it requires collusion among multiple mining pools and it seems unlikely that the cost of purchased shares would be less than the gains made. 
And if all major mining pools published their shares, it would be easy to cross-reference to see if shares published appeared more than once.

It did become a conversation, but the logic was flawed. It didn't take into account the instability of cartels. If it's beneficial for one group of miners to defect and withhold blocks, then it's beneficial for another group to, potentially within the same group. 
It also relied on the assumption that it was possible to control the propagation of blocks by announcing your block as soon as you hear a competitors block and have it be likely to win. Not only that, the same reasoning as above could be applied. If the "selfish" miners could do it, then so could the "selfless" miners. 
The whole naming scheme "selfish/selfless miners" betrays the economic incoherence of the whole paper. I'm glad serious academics are getting into Bitcoin, tho.

Bitcoin is working and up until now it has behaved like there was no blocksize limit, because demand hasn't filled the blocks. 
Keeping the limit at 1MB is actually introducing new dynamics into the system by imposing scarcity where previously there was none, once demand fills up the blocks. 
So raising the block limit seems to be the conservative approach to me.

It's not dumping 20x more load on the servers, it's raising the maximum by 20x. You're not going to see 20x more bitcoin transactions just because the maximum was raised.

I don't think it's possible without some pretty incredible hacking skills. You'd have to get each router to pass packets to nearby routers, which would involve getting access to every wifi network along the path. And then you'd need to change the routers' software to a meshnet protocol, at which point you would have just set up a bunch of meshnodes without the owners' permission.
I recommend researching meshnets a bit more, since you are interested. There's lots of amazing stuff in there, just takes a little digging to get it out.
@_date: 2014-09-23 08:31:27
Thanks for the tip. My preference for byzantium is mostly based on use of use. cjdns has a pretty steep learning curve (people need to be comfortable with a command line) whereas byzantium is just "plug this in and reboot" and it comes with versions of Twitter and IRC so you can immediately start organizing and communicating. 
I don't actually know enough about the protocols to compare and contrast them. I know byzantium uses OLSR, and cjdns is its own protocol. I also met the lead dev of byzantium, wicked smart dude. Sorry I can't tell you more.

Maybe the cost structure isn't right yet, but in places where the ISPs are largely monopolized it might still work, since you just have to make it a little cheaper than the ISP. Small apartment communities often share wifi to save money, it would just be a generalization of that. 
Also the cost of a raspberry pi with a good wifi antenna is less than $100
@_date: 2014-08-29 23:21:24
Sorry for being unclear. If you take a random transaction and look at the transaction hashes of all the inputs, they are usually scattered all over the place, which is what you would expect. This one is different in that they are all very close to each other and all in numeric order. 
As far as I understand, it should not be possible for someone to do this without having cracked SHA-256 in some way. This is important because if someone cracked SHA-256, they could have a huge advantage in mining, since mining involves double hashing the block headers concatenated with a nonce. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 06:13:49
If by edge of the mesh you mean end user, then yes they would be paying for data. Since meshnodes are easy to set up, there would eventually be many to choose from and users would naturally pick the cheapest one, putting pressure on the service provider to lower prices. 
If by edge of the mesh you mean the meshnodes that connect to the big internet, then they would be paying the ISP for data and reselling it downstream, either making a profit (probably not) or just making some of their money back.

These conversations inevitably stem from misunderstanding about money. The best explanation of money I've heard is that the amount of money you hold is supposed to represent how much you've contributed to the economy minus how much you've taken. Anything can be used as money (even tulips), but some things are better for money than others. Bitcoin is excellent for money. It's also good for other things as well, like exposing the fact that school teachers are frequently all too eager to tell children what to think, rather than teaching them useful skills.

Hey thanks for the info. I see your point, but changing the first byte only gives ~256 possible outputs per transaction, which doesn't seem to be nearly enough to generate this much order, especially since just changing one byte should create a very different hash, and these are all pretty close to each other. 
Are there bytes other than the first one that could be brute forced? 
@_date: 2014-08-30 01:33:11

It doesn't require a separate payment per kilobyte or whatever, it's more like opening a tab at a bar. There's 3 transactions involved. You want internet, so you make a transaction paying for some amount of data, but you don't announce it. Then you make another one (the refund transaction) that will give you all the money back after some time limit in case the bar's internet goes down or something. Then you also make a transaction (the tab) that has two outputs, one back to you, one to the bar. As you order more, you update the tab to shift more of the money from your output to the bar's output. When you leave, the bar announces the last version of the tab that it saw, spending the same output as the refund transaction, preventing you from getting all your money back.
TL;DR: It does work, it's like opening a bar tab and only paying for what you use.

Meshnets are like decentralized computer networks. Everybody routes packets (information) for everybody else. It's like how in bitcoin everybody checks everyone else's transactions. 
The issue with meshnets is how to get people to set up meshnodes, which are computer programs that act like mini-ISPs (ISP = internet service provider, like comcast in USA). Meshnodes can be made easy to set up, but there needs to be some reason for people to do it other than that they believe in the cause. Bitcoin technology (micropayment channels, like opening a tab at a bar) could be used to automate this, so people could just set up a meshnode for ~60$ and start making bitcoin whenever internet packets pass thru the meshnode. 
Hope this helps
@_date: 2014-09-23 08:44:11
If I understand your scheme correctly, in the miles and miles away case, it seems like it would require the non-byzantium wifi signals to forward packets for you, which they won't do unless someone changes the software (i.e. makes it into a meshnode).

Ok assuming you don't have a VPN, it goes like this. 
If you don't use HTTPS or some other kind of encryption, anybody between you and the server you are requesting data from can see your traffic. As in, somebody sitting in the same cafe as you can use something like wireshark to listen to all the traffic to and from you. Or anybody at the ISP, or anybody who has access to the backbone that you are using.
If you use HTTPS, then the same people can see where your packets are going, but not what is in them. This is an example of metadata. So I could see that your IP was sending requests to "howareyougentlemen.com" but not exactly what was being requested. In order to read the actual contents of your HTTPS traffic, they would have to be able to decrypt it somehow or impersonate the server by compromising their digital certificate, both of which are a lot more challenging than simply passively listening at a convenient junction.

The important piece is a notion of a proxy, which is someone (a computer) that forwards your traffic on your behalf. So it's like when you're in kindergarten, and you have a crush on someone and ask your friend to go talk to her/him for you. 
A VPN is an encrypted proxy. They pretend they are the ones making your requests, then send the result back to you, encrypted. Anyone sniffing your traffic between you and the VPN server will only see that you talking to the VPN, but the traffic will be encrypted, so they won't know who the VPN is forwarding your traffic to. The VPN will be able to see your traffic, if it is unencrypted (HTTP instead of HTTPS), just like your friend can read the notes that you give him to pass to your crush, unless it's in a secret code. So use HTTPS when you use a VPN.
The VPN will be able to see your IP/MAC address and associate that with your account number, so keep that in mind. Moving around to different hotspots changes your IP, not your MAC. Changing your MAC address can be done from the command line.
This graphic is helpful, altho it's for Tor instead of a VPN, but the basic idea is the same. Tor is like a triple-proxy where none of the proxies know the entire route of your traffic. Similar principles apply, just replace Tor with VPN in your mind.

There are other options, of course, but which of these sounds more effective to you? A doesn't change the fact that the network is opt-in, so while poor people might not be able to afford the hardware necessary, middle/upper class people all around the world could, so you'd still have a game of whack-a-mole, which is asymmetric warfare with the attacker being on the losing side.
B on the other hand addresses the weakest link in most security systems: people. You wanna talk about decentralization? How about the barrier to entry for becoming a bitcoin developer? Every new feature we tack onto bitcoin raises that barrier to entry. It makes it harder and harder for volunteer devs to keep up with all the paid devs, making it easy for whoever can pay devs to control the direction of the project.  
If you care at all about bitcoin, please don't dismiss such possibilities lightly.

In the case that the VPN has your identity (name, address, cc, etc), it won't make a big difference. In the case that they don't (ex. Mulvad) it may make a bigger difference. 
If you want another layer, you can always start up your vpn, then start up tor, so that all your VPN knows is that you are using Tor. You can wireshark yourself to see that the tor traffic is going thru the vpn tunnel.

Sure, I wasn't referring to a conflict of interest pertaining to her, since I'm not aware of any.

The transactability and transportability definitely factor into the value of gold, since they are non-zero. Suppose you could have gold but it was impossible to move or transfer ownership of it. Then what would the price of gold be? Zero, since nobody can receive it, nobody will pay anything for it.

This is definitely a concern, but I think there are two mitigating factors. First, as long as there is some free country on the planet that has a good internet connection, this isn't catastrophic. Second, the more capital that flows into bitcoin, the less capital the banker-states have for shenanigans. 
This is one of the main value propositions of bitcoin for me, that now we have an outside source for price discovery of fiat currencies, exposing them for the ponzi schemes they are.

Do you think number-of-users is an important factor in decentralization?
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:41:14
Interesting answer. I think as the amount of gold you own increases, the incentive to steal it grows much more quickly than the difficulty of physically moving it. One kilogram of gold is not much harder to carry than one gram, but it is much more valuable than one gram. So I don't think decreasing the portability of gold increases the security and therefore value by much. It seems like what you really want is the owner should be able to transport it effortlessly and everyone else has a very hard time transporting it. Interesting how you ignored the boundary between owner and non-owner. Are you Autolycus, by any chance?

That's an interesting metric. I haven't heard it before. It seems like a good one. 
Are there other definitions of decentralization? "Center" seems to imply a geometry of some sort, so decentralization could be some measure of how spread out something is in that geometry...variance? Clustering coefficients? 
Maybe there is some way to capture the difference between being on the Board of Directors / Shareholder of a Central Bank vs running a node. Something like "how difficult is it for existing members to keep new members out"? It's different from the price of running a full node bc the current members don't have much control over that so they can't create arbitrary barriers to entry... ideas?

I would say this gives much greater utility over fiat, but it doesn't totally encompass the utility. Bitcoin also has all the utility of the existing monetary system for non-bankers.


Absolutely. I just don't see how they could keep out someone who has enough capital to run the nodes. It's different from the Federal Reserve Board where no matter how much money you have, if the shareholders of the Fed don't want you in, you can't get in. I could be wrong, but I don't see a mechanism for existing node operators/miners to increase the barrier of entry for new participants without increasing their own costs by the same amount. Unless of course we dramatically change the protocol. Do you see a way?

I think the selfish mining thing is a canard. It assumes 
1) a dichotomy between "honest" and "selfish" miners  
2) that one can consistently outrun the other party in getting your block propagated. 
I think both of these assumptions are false. 
1) Whatever incentive miners have to be "selfish" and defect from the "honest" miners is also an incentive to defect from the "selfish" miners and create your own "selfisher" pool. Rinse wash repeat. Cartels are unstable, read the story of Eris and the golden apple.
2) This assumption is party-agnostic, there's nothing about their selfishness that gives them an advantage in propagating blocks, so whatever strategy they use to gain this advantage could be used by honest miners, too.
To be fair, I didn't read this paper, but I did read the selfish mining paper, and I haven't seen anybody address these criticisms.

For those who don't know what this about, this is an important piece in the emerging solution to the identity problem online. How do I know I'm paying who I think I'm paying? Making digital signatures with a bitcoin address (doesn't have to be where you keep your life savings) means you can have one key associated with your identity and use it for secure communication as well as receiving bitcoin. 
The point about it potentially reducing the security of the key because it exposes the public key is technically valid, but if private keys are derivable from public keys, the hashing of the public key used in bitcoin addresses is a thin wall to hopefully hold your life savings over until we switch out the digital signature algorithm for something not broken. Such an event would be devastating to bitcoin, but probably would not destroy it completely, and should not prevent people from doing things like OP.

Can we drop the term "filthy rich"? If you acquired your money without the use of deceit or violence, you fucking deserve it. Gloriously rich more like

I think you are mistaken if you think the real goal of central bankers is general economic prosperity. Tyrants who want to control other people are usually terrified of other people.

hey I don't mind being an amateur. Would you explain in greater detail what you mean? If you have knowledge that is valuable, I'm not the only one who would appreciate it :)

I disagree that boss-worker relationships are necessarily heirarchical. The worker can fire the boss by quitting, taking his labor elsewhere. If its voluntary its a symmetric relationship.

Gold has certain properties that make it useful as money. Check out this article:

hahaha and you thought schools were supposed to educate you...
Seriously tho, kudos for being involved in bitcoin at a young age. Blessed are the nerds, for they shall inherit the earth.

"Since the btc has no inherent value (it doesn't physically exist and does not contain special properties or intellectual assets)..."
False. Bitcoin does have value, because it has special properties that make it useful as a currency and other humans (who usually accept currency) are valuable. See here for more details
Just because you could implement a Ponzi scheme that uses bitcoins doesn't mean bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. The fact that early investors benefit more from it does not make it a Ponzi scheme, either. (Is the stock market a Ponzi scheme?)  The fact that you can set the price to whatever you want does not make it a Ponzi scheme, since this is true for *all commodities. 
You wanna read about a really effective Ponzi scheme? Take a look at the fractional reserve banking system. They control the amount of Bernie Madoffing so it is stable for longer. No wonder the Swiss bankers are calling btc a pyramid scheme: they would know.

Focusing on names can be misleading. Just because two legal entities have different names doesn't mean they aren't ruled or at least influenced by the same proxy. 
The money probably comes with strings attached. There is of course an enormous incentive for banks to influence who gets this prize, since that person gains credibility in the eyes of laypersons and can function as a proxy spokesperson. It's a variation on the Sybil attack.  
And by the way it is inaccurate to say "you can't just say" because I did just say and maybe I was incorrect or maybe I was rude but I still said it. Your claimed distinction between issuance and funding of the prize is not impossible, but I find it highly unlikely, given the reputation banks have on this planet.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the paper assumes the sequence of steps will be 
find A, B such that BirthdayHash(A + H) == BirthdayHash(B + H)
then see if Hash(A + B + H) &lt; Difficulty
This requires a lot of memory to find A and B (and C and D and...) but what if we reverse the steps? 
find C such that Hash(H + C) &lt; difficulty
for (i = 1; i &lt;= C; i++)
   if (BirthdayHash(C - i + H) == BirthdayHash(i + H))
       return blockFound;
Basically we choose A = i and B = C - i so A + B == C. If it turns out that solutions to 
Hash(A + B + H) &lt; Difficulty 
are more difficult to find than solutions to 
BirthdayHash(A + H) == BirthdayHash(B + H) 
then this seems like it would make it a bit simpler, no? Maybe I'm missing something.
