Hello, EnglishBulldog!
We were already expecting questions like this. With our business model we receive 20% return over investment in approximately 2 months and the 10% mining fee until the miners are breaking even.
20% over 2 months is nearly as good as mining. There is some sacrifice in terms of profit, but we think of this sacrifice as an investment. Doing this we provide great value for our customers and opportunity to prove ourselves and grow our mining operation faster.
Hope you find this helpful!

With significant changes in Bitcoin market value we will adjust our USD prices. If a customer does this repetitively we will certainly take care of that.
For solving the problem 3 or so day delayed refunds is something that just came into my mind, we will look into that.
If you have any suggestions how we can improve this, please let us know!

Hello, firecasey!

Hello, IamSlammaJamma!
In simple words:
1) You purchase shares of our miners through our "Buy shares" section (the miners have already been ordered and in fact,  batch KnC Neptune miners has been long sold out from the KnC website)
2) You are shown your unique payment address (in case you pay in BTC) and given a customer number. All this is also sent to your email as an invoice
3) You send BTC to your unique payment address, we process the payment
4) You can log in using your customer ID and password and see your pending invoices/already purchased shares, total power etc.
Once the KnC ships miners (we will likely pick them up locally), we can start printing money!

Hello, workahaulic!
Sorry for not specifying that. Yes, you are getting the same amount of BTC as when you ordered.
In fact, your bitcoins stay in your unique payment address for 14 days, so they are easily accessible and you can see them.
We will add this our FAQ.
Thank you!
