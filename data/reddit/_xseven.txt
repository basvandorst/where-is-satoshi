There were easier and quieter ways Bitfinex could've scammed you.
Oh, and you wouldn't have been any the wiser in that case either.

Probably had a breakthrough in chip tech and need to get rid of their own miners as new ones are getting manufactured.
Reminder - No one sells a money printing machine unless they have one that prints faster.

I don't really understand the why pools are required in the first place? Isn't there a way to actively disincentivize pooled mining?

Truly decentralized exchanges are impossible to make, if there is fiat involved. It requires doing an escrow/exchange in the real world (for fiat) - This takes a lot of time. It also puts trust in the middleman doing the escrow.
Another reason why decentralized exchanges might fail is because of the speed of transfers. fiat differentiates between transfers and settlements. Settlements usually take a long time. Why do all the exchanges have to hit the blockchain? What happens when the escrow(agent/service) is non-cooperative? What if Alice or Bob can reverse the fiat transfers by claiming it was done by mistake or it was fraudulent? There a lot more edge cases which make this model fail.
The only way to reduce/eliminate counter party risk is to stick to implementations that build on the Bitcoin network. Before that, there's a lot of work that needs to be done. (Smart contracts, lightning network, etc.)

Terrible idea. With credit, comes risk. Risk is better managed in a pool than when it is distributed

No, thin blocks actually reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network(between nodes) to prove that a block has been mined. The faster that proof propagates, the better for a miner.(because it affirms that they found the block first).
Thin blocks reduce block propagation time by almost the same factor as the compression of the block data itself.

That's no different than what it is today. 
Also, in the longer term, fees will be a primary source of the mining income. No transactions? No fees!

I think comparing it to pre-existing asset classes is a flawed theory. No historical asset class has had a planned limited supply. The prices spiked mostly because no one or at most a minuscule percentage of the people buying the asset anticipated the reduced supply.

This is exactly why we should move to bits. It will have a much bigger impact on the value than most humans realize.
We're not good at imagining and dealing with numbers like 0.0023313. We usually have 10 fingers, 2 eyes, 2 hands, 1 nose, 2 legs. We're not really good at realizing what 0.05% bac really means!!
Edit - yea, I don't mind moving to satoshis as well. Just make it easier for people to understand what the damn Tshirt says.
