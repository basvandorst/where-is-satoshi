Not to mask his writing style, rather, it's a document intended to be read by the entire world, don't you think you might edit it first, if not have someone else look over and edit it for you?

I feel like it's fucking him.  This guy is fucking Keyser Soze-ing the whole world right now.

Not to mention taking out a mortgage or a small business loan...

Such a boss.

I could take over the world too if I had a clone of me that literally went and did everything with me.

There's absolutely too many things that line up here.  This is it, this is the guy.  Occam's Razor applies.

This really doesn't give us any convincing new information one way or the other.  Of course if he actually is the real Satoshi, he would continue to deny it, and then disappear again when things blow over.  [Basically he could have just fucking Keyser Soze-ed the AP](

Well no shit, if he is indeed the real Satoshi, you think he's just going to be like, "You found me!  Hurray!"  Nope, he's going to deny it as long as possible to let things blow over to some degree, then fucking disappear again.

This is actually good news.
edit:  downvoted.  This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:56:03
Not to mention he would have had someone edit it for him.

It is a 2011 coin actually, how would I find out if it's one with an error?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:08:17
I really haven't heard or been paying attention, but how much more are people speculating the value to go up?
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:54:00
Uhm yeah, it has the spelling error...wow.
