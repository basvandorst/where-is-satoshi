Meh, pretty much all websites have DDoS attacks anymore.  This too will pass.

How I manage my mining operation is by first utilizing a good accountant and listening to their advise as to how to run my business.  If you live in the US, you can capitalize your expenses, provided your following the rules and...
You don't want to make a profit in your first 5 years of business, it's more profitable to lose money and write it off.  That's the real way it works!
Holding is great right now, mine low and keep the taxes down.  Sell high.

The part about waiting for 120 confirmations isn't always true.  I haven't had to wait for 120 confs since ever.   Slush requires 100, the longest conf's I've ever waited for.  PPS and mining pools that payout after as few as 6 confs tend to be reasonable options to many people as well.

I'll take the price of Bitcoin over Paycoin ANY DAY ;)  Paycoin will probably take the honer of being the first coin to fail twice in about as many months.

You can ask.  It's big enough to make me happy that I'm helping secure the network.  It's not so big that I can't afford it either, all things in moderation.  I could just as easily spend the same cash on golf, traveling, or even custom cars.  It costs what it costs and to some of us just because it's Bitcoin doesn't change a single thing.  At least the money invested here can help people in ways that places like gofundme can only imagine.

I predict that if you don't invest more then you are willing to lose then you'll do great!  I really don't think that you should be concerned about selling any Bitcoin that you invest in, it's so simple that it's like shooting fish in a barrel.

I can't speak for the UK, but I use a large well known exchange in the USA and I find it to be quite fair in it's business practices.  When I sell, the price is fixed at the time of the sale. I simply have to wait on average for four business days for the bank transfer to complete, which is normal for any bank transfer on this side of the pond.

Funny how that works, I froze Circle's funds after they put two test deposits to my bank account and started asking me for further verification data before I ever did a single transaction of any type with them! Karma.  Meanwhile their main competition, who has never asked me for any significant personal data continues to get my business. If the exchange that I do business ever does ask, they don't get that kind of data from me either.  Plan B is fine with me - Buy gold/silver with BTC from Amagi and sell it back to the local coin shop at spot.

As much as I admire Snowden, he is done for in the USA in so far as the government is concerned.  It would simply be throwing good BTC after bad in his case.  He simply needs to accept his fate and move on, maybe make some pron with that hot Russian spy and sell it if he needs funding for anything now.

Your overthinking it, 99% of miners will definitely not turn off for any reason imaginable to you.  I don't mine for profit, but to secure the network.  Your FUD hoax is exposed like the soon to be leaked photo of Cody Wilson mounting Josh Garza in Miami.

"By-Gosh Josh Garza" is too big of a target for that noise.  He's sold plenty of BTC mining hardware in his day.  He deserves to be talked about here as much as anyone.

Yawn, been here before, newbie.

There's always Ebay.  Sell them and buy yourself some new toy.
