With your over the top language and put-downs, one could easily assume you're the shill, shilling for all things Korea.
While demonstrating your blind lust for Korea, you failed to mention that all supported browsers/operating systems still require download of 4 to 5 "security" programs which actually make your pc more unstable and insecure.  
Here's the proof:
These security programs have to be constantly updated to stay compatible with all the different browsers and OSs. Really a total waste of human and capital resources on both server and client side, and on the economy as a whole.
In order to transfer money I still need an electronic certificate on my pc which requires a popup screen. Having an OTP device isnt enough. 
It's total overkill here with layer upon layer  of outdated  security/authentication methods for any kind of online commerce and most tech-savvy Koreans would agree.

So far no licensing requirements as regulators have pretty much ignored it like most Koreans. 
However, there is a company that has been trying to bring in the robocoin atm. Supposedly it has been stuck in customs for 4 months.

A scam? The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis was a scam of monumental proportions. Koreans handed over their gold to help the government  pay back IMF loans and multinationals bought Korean assets pennies on the dollar once the Won was engineered to collapse. If its done by governments and banks, its not a scam. If its open source and decentralized, its a scam. Is that how Korean society thinks?

1% transaction fee vs minimum 3% transaction fee with credit card. Less fraud and no chargeback risk. 
Also, there is a two week application process in Korea to accept credit cards. Application fee is around 200,000.
Settlement period isnt as good as Korbit's (and most cryptocurrency processors) which is daily versus once or twice a week (in Korea).
Not sure how many integration options there are on Korbitpay though. I only see payment buttons right now. Koreans need to use more open source shopping cart options like opencart, etc so that processors have an incentive to make easy integration plugins.

Yeah, the transaction volume on the exchanges here is pathetic.

In terms of privacy, you dont see the difference between having a bank account and having a bitcoin wallet? Cant help you then.
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:15:02
Will the police ask us to hand over our bitcoin addresses in the future?

The overall movement toward decentralization and anonymous transactions will hopefully slow down if not thwart Big Brother's attempt to pry into our private lives. This for me is a big reason to support technologies which utilize cryptography.

As of 11pm KST I see a 100,000KRW (around 90USD) markup for 1 BTC between this ATM service and the average spot price of Korea's three major exchanges! 
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:57:12
You're right, I cant imagine any Korean would need this service except teens who need bitcoin at any cost for online games. 
I've seen some foreigners using a Lamassu ATM at the Bitcoin Center in Itaewon. I assume they use the ATM because they don't have a bank account in Korea or prefer not to have bitcoin related transactions recorded in their bank account.

Can this be modified for Ubuntu on a laptop with 500gig hard drive?
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:34:42
Thanks! Just curious is there any advantage using your setup with lnd than this one with docker?:
