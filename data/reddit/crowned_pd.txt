Do you think we will ever be able to pay for hospital bills with crypto? I was feeling bad all weekend and had to go to the hospital today, I sold some of my bitcoin to be able to pay for the bill. With the transaction fees it was very expensive so I was just wondering if crypto will ever be used for real life problems

when do you think bitcoin will be worth 5 figures?

Thanks, read all your comments but it is difficult to respond one by one. I read about bitcoin and I learned about it before "investing", problem is that I was not sure how to buy BTC in my country (Mexico) so that's why I trusted these people. Your comments really made me feel better and I will buy some more BTC by the end of this month once I get paid, I plan to invest most of my salary and hope for the best.

A year ago I heard about Bitcoins and I was excited about the concept, I didn't know much about it so I found a group of people who were "bitcoin traders". I am... or was far from an internet expert (I am 51) so I decided to invest most of my savings with them. Truth is that they are pyramid scheme, they took advantage of the ignorance of many people and I feel frustrated because I realize I will never see my money back. I want to invest in bitcoin on my own but as you can imagine I feel vert reluctant. Do you think this is a good moment to invest? I want to read your opinions to convince me.

As an uber driver who invests everything in bitcoin, I wish it was like this!

I was told by people in this sub and that bitcoin will be worth 5 digits by the end of the year... it doesn't look likely but I seriously hope it happens
