This might be a complicated question, but can you explain your decision to sell for bitcoin? I see great value in bitcoin, but the volatile nature of it seems to pose an enormous risk when selling high-priced items/property. If your 20k in BTC goes down even 2% in the weeks following the sale, it would seem to be a devastating loss. Why not sell the house for cash and strategically invest over a larger period of time? Is it kinda just a gamble, considering it **could** suddenly jump up instead of trickle down like it has in recent months? 
I've always had these thoughts for online retailers that accept bitcoin too. So a store buys a product for $1,000 and sells it to someone online for $1,200. Bitcoin drops 10% in a week and now you're barely making enough to cover the original product. It would just seem much more logical to take fiat and invest a percentage of your profit in the currency. 
Thinking back to when BTC was ~20k, people were selling houses, cars, etc for BTC. Months later we're at 8k. That million dollar house is now "worth" $400k unless the holder waits for it to go back up. 
I don't know if I just miss the entire point of bitcoin but it seems better fitted for smaller transactions with less risk of devaluation. 
Good luck to you though!

These posts honestly make me angry. Is nobody going to talk about how much they are loosing? Yeah I'm all about the technology but this is fucking insane. Down 61% in 6 months. Down 20% in 30 days. Yeah yeah, keep repeating HODL but maybe use some fucking strategy? If you sold half your coins when the price started tanking, you could use that to buy more coins at this low price. Hindsight is 20/20, but USD will likely never tank this bad. Might as well HODL USD until things stabilize.

What's mindblowing about bitcoin to me is that an early adopter who held through the thick and thin could walk up to a business like this, pay with a technology they were faithful in, and walk out with a sports car. This currency is a dream come true.
