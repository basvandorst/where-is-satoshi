Never going to happen, because that that would make current holders too rich. More likely, a bitcoin-like currency will be adopted.

What's really stopping the the government or financial institutions from establishing there own bloclchain-like technology to maintain their currency? This doesn't make bitcoin obsolete. It would be more of a middle-man.

Hmm.. Not really. Someone that has access to resources won't spend their time micro-managing. They'll hire experts and then they'll hire even more. On a smaller scale, not much is necessary. I'm talking about the difference  between a few million and 8 figures plus.

Also reffering to the majority holders (wouldn't that make multi-billionaires). Wouldn't it make more sense to take btc by example and have a governemnt controlled blockchain?

To those expecting 10k per bitcoin by the end of 2014 you're gonna have a bad time.

haha *yes* haha

They're interested in using blockchain-like technology for their own implementation. Not necessarily bitcoin.

Man.. u wot.. wtf . Serius???

Coinbase is the paypal of bitcoin.

Bitcoin needs to become easier to actually aquire and exchange with currency. Currently there are too many hoops that one needs to jump through.

I just never sold ;)

The market is correcting itself. Maybe, btc will rise above 7k, but no one really knows. Bitcoin was overvalued, because everyone was buying it in preparation for segwit 2x. Now there's alot of movement into altcoins (especially bch) and alot of capital leaving crypto  back to fiat.

You're right, no one really knows where the market is going. As the saying goes, buy from the pessimistis and sell to the optimists.

It's subjective. Speculative. Why do most people buy BTC? What kind of person do you think contributes to the total volume traded? The bottom line is that people are trying to turn a profit. Sure there's people buying into the philosophy of the blockchain or as the intended use as a curremcy. But the majority of people are here to make money. Crypto is for these  reasons highly speculative and their prices, highly volatile. So the value, I reason, is a construct of what people beleive it's worth. It's not like assessing the value of a stock, which has a solid business backing it with tangible goods.

I sold at 2,200. Kinda started regretting it when it hit 2,799, but it was the obvious choice. Green candlestick taking up half a screen is a good indicator to sell lol.

What do we want? *large transaction fees and long confirmation times*

To play the devils advocate, the main argument stems off of the condition that one person uses few wallets and conducts transactions dirrectly. A virtual currency exchange (from btc wallet A --to any currency--back to btc wallet B,C, and D) will severely impair the ability to track certain transactions. You could even more simply use a BTC mixer.

That is, if it's a credit card. Credit cards are always more secure than debit, because it's the bank's money.
