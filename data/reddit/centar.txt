How do you figure? Fees are a central tenant of all cryptos. If what you're saying is that cryptos are supposed to get rid of other currencies so there's no trading and therefore no fees, you're clearly not understanding how this works.

I would ask you whether you A.) Believe in a lawless, anarchist state where fiat doesn't exist because government doesn't exist. Or B.) You believe your sovereignty will accept bitcoin for your taxes.

Care to share where and when you make the judgement on when a commodity becomes "speculation and luck" rather than an investment vehicle? I'm no trying to bust your balls, just genuinely curious about what you think the tipping point is.

To be fair, "spinning media" isn't a term that a lot of people use. Along with phrasing it 'X over Y" instead of "X instead of Y" could also be confusing. If you had used HDD or Disk Drive, maybe he understands what you're saying. Don't assume he's clueless just because he doesn't understand your slightly atypical nomenclature.

I've always supported the work Core has done, and the things Roger Ver and his cronies do make me sick to my stomach, but in reality I don't see the major issue with increasing the blocksize to 2mb. It's really not that big of a change and would relieve some of the congestion immediately. If we could do that, and then convince all the major wallets and exchanges to implement Segwit I think we would be in a much better position.

If you don't feel safe using Coinbase you're probably not going to feel safe using anyone else either. Maybe try buying from someone directly. I've had a couple issues with Coinbase, but they've always resolved it in the end (albeit after several days and weeks in some cases).

What you want is lower fees, that doesn't necessarily mean bigger blocks.

From my own experience, one S9 will warm my garage to a comfortable temperature (55-65 F) when temperatures are anywhere from 25 - 50 F. Keep in mind that is a smaller area, but has very minimal insulation. I think 3 S9s would heat an insulated basement fairly comfortably, but the noise will be intense (each one is around 75db, little quieter in cold temps).

You've heard of these things called VPNs, right?

If you're doing this in the future it might be worth it to get an llc and set up a business account. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:54:57
Yes, one Antminer S9 is making about $9/day in BTC AFTER electricity (at average Kw/h prices). If you're smart and hold on to that bitcoin instead of immediately selling it, you stand to make a lot more. Even if you sold it immediately, you would still pay it off in about 5 months (assuming prices don't go up at all) and make pure profit from there. Keep in mind it is an asset at that point and you could still resell it to recoup your costs (and sell it for a hefty premium as well).

I think it depends on what you want to do in life. I personally do not have a college degree and I've gotten by just fine. My kids may or may not want/need to go to college for whatever it is they want to do. I want to be able to fund their dreams, whatever they may be. Stop being such a cunt.

Thousands and thousands of "little guy" miners do just fine every day. It is such a ridiculous myth that it's only profitable for the big guys with cheap electricity.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:13:06
They cannot ban cash transactions, there is always a way to circumvent exchanges - whether via VPNs, international exchanges, peer to peer transactions. You're really failing to see the big picture. Also, more importantly I'm saying that governments can only enact laws which reflect the will of their constituents. They may in the short term be able to ban something, but in the long term they WILL be forced to listen to the people. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:10:25
Oh man, I really can't wait till I get to that magic whole number. The longer it takes the harder it is getting though, wish the price wasn't going so crazy lately. Ultimately I want to have (at least) one bitcoin for each of my kids, hopefully it will fund their education one day and maybe more, who knows.

Who is America? If you believe the American people have less power than "the government," you don't understand Democracy or you're too jaded to trust in it.

Tax reasons??
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:40:49
Governments exist because of the consent of the governed. When the people decide what currency they want to use, the government has no authority to intercede.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:30:48
This is honestly what makes me worry about bitcoin, the fact that so many believe it is a legitimate replacement for fiat. If you believe wealth is already too concentrated among too few, bitcoin is not solving that problem. It is not really "liberating" in the sense most people think. It may mean financial freedom for early adopters, but that is only a shift in wealth among a very few. Taxation of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is never going to work on a global scale. We have to stop thinking of bitcoin as a total solution and start expanding the horizon. This is where new technology will need to play a part. We should probably stop talking about replacing the current system and start thinking about how to best integrate it. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:23:22
Homelessness, child poverty, and stagnant wages are all incredibly complex social problems which have no real "solutions." Hardly equivalent to a currency preference.

You always get your money back. Traders always have to settle their trades within a relatively short time (28 days on Kraken for example). When they "settle up"  they either have to buy the "borrowed" margin at the price they initially opened the trade at, or they get the difference in price deducted from their trading balance. You're required to keep a certain amount in your account to trade margin so you can't just cut and run if your trades implode.

"There is no reason to expect there to be more than one major crypto once things shake out."
You have nothing to base this on. How many currencies does the world operate on today? Once crypto is adopted more widely, why would it be any different?

yes, there are soooo many people here and in other bitcoin related spaces that will tell you again and again how mining isn't profitable and how you shouldn't do it. They are everywhere. You are not crazy, they are actively trying to suppress new miners from getting into the business and making them less profitable.

Hey Dan, 
I know I'm a little late to the party on this one but just wanted to say thanks for sharing your setup, a lot of us really do appreciate seeing how other people make money. Just had one somewhat silly question if you have time: is there a reason why you need a greenhouse to grow crops in San Diego? Isn't the climate already pretty well setup to handle farming outdoors? Just curious what it is about a greenhouse that makes this possible. I was under the impression they were mainly needed in colder climates. Thanks!
