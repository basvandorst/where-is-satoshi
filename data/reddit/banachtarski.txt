Yes I am critiquing it. The KJ Bible is poor literature. Inferior to older mythology and inferior to modern fantasy fiction. I've read the whole thing and it's awfully boring.

King James Bible is better fiction than Lord of the Rings? No way. The former suffers from poor writing, boring characters, plenty of plot holes, and serious overuse of deus ex machina.
And mathematics has been considered an [art]( since antiquity. Beauty has always been the goal of pure mathematics. 
Furthermore, mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable, and does not meet Karl Popper's criteria for a science. 
I'm a mathematician. I know what I'm talking about.

Why is mathematics not art, but literature or sculpture is? Mathematics is art just like painting. 
And how are modern works like Lord of the Rings, 1984, To Kill a Mockingbird, Lord of the Flies, Catch-22 etc. inferior to literature from the 1400's to 1700's?

Mathematics is an art, and Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last theorem is certainly among the greatest intellectual and artistic accomplishments in the history of mankind.
You think culture is regressing because we don't build as many fancy churches today?
