If the banks start issuing a digital currency of their own, it would provide a whole new level of an "on ramp" into Bitcoin. There's still a challenge of getting cash into the network, but with fedcoins... Those problems would almost be entirely eliminated.

Meant to post that in a different thread. Sorry!

It will send them once the first transaction has 6 confirmations. Don't worry.

I've heard some concerns about the security aspects of libbitcoin. Some people question the integrity of the port, and it lacks in code reviews by peers to determine the safety. Any thoughts or comments on this?

I don't see how a China announcement could affect bitcoin at this point since the last moved killed their volume.

Email sends messages, Bitcoin sends money.

The larger the market cap, the harder it is to manipulate. What's to stop them from exploring these same tactics now with the small cap on existing exchanges?

For promoting a diplomatic solution? I'm not saying to concede anything, but it seems Jihan needs some education around LN and the potential, his comment doesn't open the door to education.

If you don't have PR skills, stick to development. We have an opportunity to deescalate the situation, but you choose to escalate. I'm a SegWit supporter, but this comment was entirely unnecessary.

Good to hear, thanks. I saw chatting with some guy in IRC a while back. 
There does seem to be a lack of documentation though, am I missing something?

The bitcoinmarkets slack has a bot setup that will notify all on a decision. Don't have a link handy, but you should be able to find it with ease in @_date: 2017-01-22 17:46:25
Interesting, I haven't heard this perspective. Would Segwit significantly damage the advance in transparency that the blockchain provides?

Interesting thought. I have the equivalent of $800/mo that I can dump into a bare metal instance, VM, or cloud service. It's not exactly costing me anything out of pocket, so anything that generates income would be 'profitable'.

Sadly, it's not in the form of accessible cash that I can make purchases with.

I'd agree if Obama's cabinet wasn't built by Citi Bank.

I'm guessing that the $100 Trillion valuation is based on the current market prices of each metal. With a new abundance of resources, the market price will come crashing down; the people on the ground floor will profit immensely, but I'd say overall it will not last very long.

Well, fuck...

Are we about to see a war between central banking and retail banking for complete currency control?
@_date: 2016-10-28 11:23:45
Why would they oppose it? I haven't really seen any arguments against segwit, but I'd be interested to see that side of things.

I'm looking for a new Lumia 950 that works on AT&amp;T bands.

If the fed creates a coin, people are going to have an easy ramp to get their money into BTC and alts, that's for sure.
