Hi Shawn,
We are continually improving our withdrawal process. Our withdrawal process will be automated by the end of Q4 this year. We plan on releasing our app in Q1 of 2020. As a friendly FYI, we haven't lost any customer funds in the 2+ years that we have been in business. This is why we are trusted and [backed by some of the biggest names in the space](
Additionally, we keep our operational funds separate from customer funds unlike most of our competitors who launched ICO's and mix the 2. 
BlockFi has the best customer service in the entire space. You can give us a call and speak to a real human being at any time unlike 99% of crypto lending companies. We are happy to talk you through any questions or concerns you may have about BlockFi.

We usually process all withdrawal requests within 48 business hours. You will be able to withdraw more than 5k ETH within a 30 days period. This withdrawal limit is there for our protection and is common in the space. 
Our limits are usually based off market value and are subject to change. If ETH hits 5k per coin there would more than likely be an adjustment to that rate. 
Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi TeslaMarque,
One thing to note about earning interest with Celsius is that your interest earned never becomes apart of your crypto balance. You will only be earning interest on your deposited coins as stated in their terms of service. With BlockFi, your balance compounds and you are able to keep earning more interest on interest earned. Your interest earned always become apart of your balance with BlockFi.
We have enabled 2FA for withdrawals and will be pushing updates in the next few weeks completely automating our withdrawal process. Please note that we do process all withdrawals within 24 business hours. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

There are risks involved with storing your crypto through BlockFi's services. To earn interest on crypto, we lend out assets deposited into our account at Gemini to highly vetted and audited institutional counter-parties. Our risk and finance teams audit all of our counter-parties financials before they become a qualified borrower. Our ISDA agreements are typically over-collateralized and allow us to margin call these counter-parties on a daily basis.
For example, if one of our institutional counter-parties wants to borrow 1 million dollars in BTC, they will have to post at least 1.15 - 1.5m in USD as collateral. There is a very intensive risk management model behind BlockFi's business.
You can read about how we generate our yield for our interest accounts [**here**]( Additionally, here is a [**great resource**]( to learn more on the intricacies of our BTC lending market.
BlockFi primarily lends to large institutions whose financials are heavily audited by our risk team and institutional desk. BlockFi has an outside accounting firm prepare our financials on a monthly basis and we are audited on an annual basis.
From a risk perspective, our preference is to trade with institutions that have invested in BlockFi directly. Some examples of our primary trading partners include Akuna Capital and Susquehanna.
We have an institutional onboarding program that companies like Bitfinex do not pass. This is what differentiates our risk management program from [our competitors](
From a financial perspective, we do share more visibility with partners, but the best assurance that is available publicly is our press release announcing the [$18.4MM we raised led by Valar ventures]( Unlike funds raised by an ICO, this is pure equity capital which goes towards funding our company's operations.

BlockFi's operation capital and its lending capital are completely separate unlike most of our competitors. We have never lost any customer funds in the 2+ years we have been in business.
