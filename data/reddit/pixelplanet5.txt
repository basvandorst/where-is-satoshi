To be honest, if it weren't for this sub I wouldn't even know there are changes happening.
I would say I'm the average person that came in for the crypto goldrush, I stay for some profits and as soon as the market doesn't give fast profit anymore I'm out and never to be seen again.
The majority of people that came for the goldrush won't care about improvements, I know it's a big thing for enthusiasts but the average person won't really care.

So they are not really accepting Bitcoin, the accept bitpay as a payment provider which accepts Bitcoin.
Still not a native adoption of the tech.

So it's more like a marketing thing because it's still no native adoption of Bitcoin, they just added a payment provider that does accept Bitcoin on his side.

i agree that if you have to argue for months its probably too much money for you to spend but on the other hand there shouldnt be the need to argue about this as OP should be aware of this by himself, then again it seems like he isnt so probably better his wife talks him out of it.

as a guy whos gonna get married next year i dont get this either, if i want to spend 20k on cryptos right now i would just do it, i wouldnt need to ask for approval or anything.
the thing is i wont dot hat because its dumb as fuck unless you got a few 100k and not have to care about 20k.
And this is exactly the reason why i wouldnt need approval for anything i do with my money, my Fiance knows im responsible and im not gonna put money into something that i cant afford to lose.
when i hear of people that need approvals and shit like this i always think either there is no trust and has never been in that relationship or the guy fucked up multiple times before and ruined the trust with that.
Eitherway if your relation ship is locking you in and stopping you from living your live something is badly badly wrong.

At this point I would sell a part of it so I have some gains secured and let the remaining coins grow or fall whatever may happen

The thing is the current rise I'd not because people buy in due to their trust in the technology, people come for the fast profits, I know a dozen people who has been buying and selling Bitcoin but they don't give a shit about the bitcoins itself, all the want is the profit and if bitcoins are too expensive or rise too slow they will bail out and be gone forever.
There are millions of people like this.
