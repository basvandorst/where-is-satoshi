Firstly, nobody knows.
But if the price action moves in the same rhythm as previously the real bull run won’t start until after halving, that’s sometime in May next year. 
There’s an argument for the price increase to front run that this time as it’s becoming more predictable but it’s ok, don’t rush. And definitely don’t put any unnecessary financial burden on yourself now just to get in earlier. 
Earlier this year I was paying off a car and didn’t have disposable income to buy when it was 3k. Now I do and I’m buying at 10K. But I don’t regret it, I couldn’t afford it before, end of discussion. The only mistake was soaking up my income with the car. Overextending into a loan or something to buy bitcoin would have worked out this time for me, but it still would have been a mistake.
