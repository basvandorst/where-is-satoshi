Could it be that there are bots that are using the fact that gdax covers fees to spam transactions? Because if gdax/coinbase doesn't allow this, then the manipulation is pretty obvious.

What are you using for LTE? Wouldn't you need unlimited up and down? How much does that cost per month?

I was looking at the coinbase charts and saw the current pricings looked exactly like it did before. I was wondering if anyone else saw that

that doesn't really make sense, how did he call the wrong number when the support number pops up in a huge box in google?

I was just wondering, how do we know it won't keep going down? Is there a reason it is going down? I would think the price would go up now that the entire korea thing is over and LN is up.

I'm not well versed in physics but Einstein's theory is generally accepted as the correct view of the universe and all of our models are based upon it. I'm sure if it didn't stand up to being peer reviewed and scrutiny from the whole scientific community it wouldn't be accepted. What source disproves Einstein's theory

I don't get what is so crazy. Even if space has nothing in it, it is still something. It's still empty space where you can move matter into and such. Empty space is still a thing.

I guess I don't believe John Michelle's because my understanding of gravity was from what Einstein wrote about mass bending space
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:17:38
Did you say gravity doesn't exist?
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:38:38
I'm assuming you're being sarcastic. Why is time only a man made concept and space is still something even if it's void of any matter
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:12:39
I know you dont know what you are talking about solely by this statement
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:21:52
First of all, how the hell does the scientific method get "hijacked" and how does science get "highjacked". The scientific method hasn't really changed. You going on about all this gives me strong conspiracy theory vibes. You might be right, who knows, but the way you're talking it sounds like those people who watch a few YouTube videos on a topic and try going around "debunking" stuff
The first step is asking a question btw
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:53:19
Ok? I don't have the time to check if everything you just typed out is true or not but let's assume it is and he stole the equation... Why does gravity not exist?
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:02:22
Maxwell's equations. Weren't they supported by Einsteins gravity

You can put a cap on the temp so it throttles itself when it reaches a certain temp

I agree, it would be hard to prove that you bought bitcoin earlier and had it increase in value. And if you wanted to pay taxes on it, you would be hit by that steep 30% capital gains.

Isn't Bitcoin a terrible way to launder money? The block chain records every transaction so if the government was inclined enough, they could easily catch someone attempting money laundering. Running an old fashioned mattress store to launder money would be easier. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:13:01
Its not like paper money needs trees to be cut down or metals to be mined for coins 
@_date: 2019-11-12 02:04:48
I just read it and I don't feel like they properly explain what they count as a darknet transaction. How far up the chain do they go before it no longer counts as a darknet transaction? If they're only counting the immediate transaction to any known darknet wallets, the number should be incredibly small just due to the fact such a small number of accounts have been seized, so something doesn't entirely make sense. I feel that they counted an illegal transaction as anything before or after a darknet transaction, which could be hundreds of transactions.

Is it just me or does anyone else not like using cash. Getting change and having to put it somewhere is annoying. I just carry one card with no wallet, makes it a lot easier than a wallet full with random notes.
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:31:56
I'm not sure if this would be helpful or not, but either create a temporary wallet and encrypt + email the seed words to yourself. When you get back, take everything out and move it back to your preferred wallet.
 
You could also either memorize it, or even write it somewhere (I know they have those tattoos which last a few months).

Try changing the color scheme to colors that go together. Current website looks like random colors were thrown in. I'd also change the background to a darker grey and round all sharp corners such as in the fonts etc

accepting bitcoin would probably be a lot easier for smaller businesses. I would have to agree that for something as large as iHop, accepting bitcoin would be a lot of work.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:01:43
HAHAHA FUCKING GOLD
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:47:16
they can still convert to fiat if they want, bitcoin is pretty liquid. It would be a lot easier for a small corner store to run payments with bitcoin and manage that than for something like iHop to keep track of hundreds of payments. Plus, the changing value of bitcoin could be beneficial to the store, if the value goes up, they have made more money than they would have with fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:13:16
Well, the reason I'm saying it would go up is that if you look at the price charts, if you holded for a decent amount of time, the price would increase. The only time where you wouldn't make money is if you bought in December which is super short term
