Interesting comment. That's a dipshit wager, why the fuck would I bet dollars to donuts? 
I'm guessing you're a highly functioning retard - what care taker let you out of their sight?

So you're saying, $400 million took an $800 billion market to $400 billion?

Yeah - that's basically running an MLM op. Doesn't matter if it was message boards.
Sucks you got screwed, but anyone who deals with marketing / advertising or entreperneurship knows MLM's are a double edged sword. 
You should have shifted your business model when you realized Adsense wasn't doing squat shit to combat the scams and then sold off the business.
You guys got greedy and paid the piper. No tears spared here. Also - I'm fairly positive that you guys were making well over $70k per individual so again - no sympathy. You had a good chunk of money. You blew it. 
The internet is still a wild west shit show regardless of how big and corrupt publishers like Google are. 
Also you should have taken more control over the ad placements. You probably could have also converted it to a social media platform as opposed to a msg board. I could write pages on things you could have done to change the business from prying government eyes, but I'm too lazy and not getting paid for it. 
Hope your fam is handling it in stride.

Where the fuck does USD to USDT trading occur? When was the last time you put in $20 to buy USDT? Do you understand no American citizen can redeem their USDT? 
If Bittrex shuts down it's USDT marketplace, that means if you HAD money sitting in USDT it is locked up for good. Which means the exchange won't move it to something else because USDT would have no value and could not be traded to any other currency. Not sure how this is so hard to understand. 
USDT insolvent = USDT marketplaces shut down = USDT not redeemable = $$$ turned into dust = market crash on ANY coin that touched or received USDT 
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:55:59
Because there are people who buy crypro with USDT and vice versa. Not USDT with USD.
So this is how it works. Tether prints tokens.
Tokens are issued to exchanges. (Bitfinex,Binance,Poloniex,Bittrex,everyone else - in that order) 
Bitfinex exchange issues tokens to specific individuals in correlateral for any USDT market coin. 
In the case of Bitfinex, they go to margin play.
If margin play is successful, players recoup winnings. 
Said margin players swap BTC back to USDT and send percentages of the winnings to different exchanges.
Once in the new exchange, they buy back into BTC and pump multiple alts. 
Wait for profits, sell to BTC, sell to USDT, take it back to Bitfinex. Once back, either short BTC or go long depending on effect of dispersing of USDT through multiple exchanges and multiple alt coins.
 
So this whole time, USDT is trading hands through other coins. So, when we look at coinmarketcap, look at the different coins and who is the top volume mover for those coins. You'll see alot of USDT pairings moving said volume. 
If that volume is not there anymore, there is less demand to move any of those coins. However, before that volume disappears, USDT has to be deemed worthless (insolvent). Any news that can arouse or cement USDT insolvency has major impacts on the market.
It's a snowball of fuck all. This same scheme was done in the 1600's when the Holy Roman Empire created the stock market and currency trading.

You are an absolute fool if you think that. 
If Tether goes down, it takes down Bitfinex, Binance, Poloniex and Bittrex. 4 of the top 10 exchanges. Why? Because that's where 80% of tether went to. 
Throw in the fact that alot of tether hit margin play - panic sells and devaluation of crypto occurs. It will happen when people find out a wealthy few exchanged worthless white pieces of printing paper for $10,000 btc and then spread those profits across hundreds of alts to then sell at ATH. 
Also there is the threat of large scale network attacks which is only a couple years away. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:59:24
You are comparing Apple's to oranges and hence your counter argument is invalid. A nuclear war wipes out the whole crypto market - but was that it's intention? No. 
Look up the market crash of the holy Roman Empire in the 1600's. They didn't think it would crash the market when creating fake currency since there was no precedence, but look at the result!

Please do take a physics class because you're not asking the right questions to ascertain the proper environment to determine velocity. 
Is the cat alive? 
Is it conscious?
Is the cat being thrown or dropped?
From what point is the cat being thrown/dropped?
What is the bottom of said point?
Is there turbulence between high and low?

Take a physics class... how about you take a class on reality and cat throwing?

Your comment is making me rage. Did you mean 2017 or 2018? If 2018, add /s for sarcasm. If 2017, go to coinmarketcap. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:01:47
Depends on your definition of a scam.
They certainly fleece you. You don't get your money back from dealing with them unless you bought Q1 - Q2 of 2017. 
Read the article - the actions are fairly accurate. We ourselves paid for customs on Bitmain page and then were forced to pay because they didn't pay. So yeah - they are shady.

It is. 
But you don't need 20/20 to fucking look at a chart and say "30 days ago it was at $17k today it's $7k - it's dropping."

Just because you won't sell doesn't mean others won't. 
In your scenario price becomes so sensitive that it's a double edged sword and effectively makes BTC terrible to hold. Then Bitcoin cash comes up and takes away the Bitcoin title and it just becomes Bitcoin Lite

This is most likely a ploy to be able to move assets around sanctions - personally, no fucks given considering that those sanctions are there for political reasons and more reason to buy something that a government requires for illegal activities. If the CIA had stocks, i would buy into them. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:21:50
Yeah, it's even scarier. 
You forget the mass hysteria that would ensue with the price getting that low. 
Also - you guys are ignoring that there would have to be something news worthy to bring down the price to those levels which factors into decision making by the general populace. 
Example - large scale network attack to bitcore, changing previous transactions. 
If you saw that headline in the news and it was credible, would you buy bitcoin at $100? 
If you say yes to that, you are either a fool or have a serious gambling addiction.

They charge you for it on checkout and label it as such. We paid both customs and tax on customs. 
No misunderstanding, just deliberate word manipulation on check out page. 
They just released the X3 and it's listed at $12k. By the time you get your machine, it's A. Unprofitable and B. Monero has switched to new algo so it's worthless. 
Great legitimate fleecing business in my opinion. Will never buy from them again tho.

Are people this fucking dumb?
Tether was used to stabilize the market - of course you won't see that in data because this dumbass is using percentage growth of bitcoin to tether injections. 
Fucking dumb. If the price drops from 20k to 10k and tether is being pumped in to stop it from reaching 2k - you won't see that in any coinmarketcap graph. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:11:14
Away with you, you hodling troll. Tether was injected every time bitcoin price started to drop.

No, just read a chart. 
If you sell at 17k when it's going down, and it rebounds to 18k or 19k for a few days that's still better than losing 40k.
Simple math. Even a starving Ethiopian child could have done better.

Haha - pot meet kettle! Last time people said to trust someone else analysis, Trump ended up as president. 
When asked if we should be concerned about the Tether allegations, Shihara (bitfinex) said;
“Tough question, we treat it as another altcoin. The market agrees Tether is backed by something, as it is trading as a dollar substitute. But I always tell people to do their own research and be cautious in crypto.”
Here is Tether's sister company exec saying "tether is backed by SOMETHING" doesn't even go out of his way to say USD because he knows it's not true. 
Keep on slurping on those tether pubes. Excellent to floss out the tether semen.

Just move to coinbase and keep in the USD wallet. 
Haven't checked out robinhood so not sure if they have a usd wallet equivalent. But at least you know coinbase has an actual bank behind them despite their outrageous fees.

You're not far off the mark. Many banks cited fears of bankruptcy as the reason to cut ties to crypto purchases. 
There is also a movement to lock in credit debt in the event of bankruptcy. So basically if you file bankruptcy, credit debt would go the same way as student loans. Get your bankruptcies in now before it's too late!!!!
