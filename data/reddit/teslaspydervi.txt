This is the most ignorant thing I have read. They asses you before they give you a credit line. They try their hardest to make sure you will be able to make your payments. Why should they care what you spend your money on when they know they will get their payments? The reason they are stopping it is because of fraud. Nothing else.

Thanks for the replies guys. That's what I was originally thinking but I have a problem where I tend to over complicate things sometimes. lol

Man, I did the same exact thing as you. I put in some more money but not all that I planned on putting in in case it drops again. I'm really waiting to see what the futures are going to do to the price. I read that it's a good chance it will drop the price but who knows.

I have a question if you buy 2 coins 1 at say 12k and one at 17k. You want to sell one, it automatically sells the one you bought at the highest price first? I am asking from the perspective of Coinbase.

I bought in as well at 17k. I don't care I will ride it all the way to the barebones. Hell, I will buy more if it gets low enough. The hodl is strong here. Fists of steel baby!

Buy now, you will kick yourself. I was waiting to buy thinking it would go back to 10.9 and here we are passed 12.
