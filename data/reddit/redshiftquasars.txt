10k is a physiological point. If it does go down that far it is possible that it could even hit 8k. Either way, if your looking to pick some up on the way down, 10k isn’t a bad spot. Pretty sure we’re headed for 30k soon.

Try DialACoin. It's an IVR Based wallet. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 04:40:13
You bought in as an investment not too long ago. I purchased a house a couple years back and I am still underwater about $200,000. But it was an investment so I'm gonna hold onto the house until I am no longer underwater and then more than likely continue to keep it. Keep your Bitcoin you're gonna be good for it

Bummer. Ok, one more week then quit?
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:42:27
Yeah... I've been following the triangle your talking about(three hours later now) and the price is going up again and the trend for sure is higher lows. bad part is the stochastics are showing above the 50% really close to oversold.  The trend is very bullish I would not be surprised to see it hit a new support line where your V pattern started.  
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:23:56
How about now

@_date: 2017-11-07 03:14:37
no... that was my own doing.  you were fine with how you came off and really appreciate your input.  but I've also found this as a resource.  I hope this helps:
Looks like Armory is a fullnode wallet.  and it will transact on the Core Chain at this point.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:51:45
thx... will do
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:32:58
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:23:23
ok... but just so that you know, using this wallet alone will not keep you safe from replay attack.  I wanted to get solid evidence that this wallet would would be a 1x wallet and from there build upon making safe transactions by using tainted Unspent Transactions.  I believe that there is an article that Jimmy Song has put out based on this.   
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:09:34
ok... was probably being lazy, at first but here is what I've found so far at the following URL: 
This is what is listed down towards the bottom:
**How to run a full node as your wallet**
I think every moderate user of bitcoin would benefit by running a full node and using it as their wallet. There are several ways to do this. 
Run a bitcoin-qt full node.
Use wallet software that is backed by a full node (e.g. Armory, JoinMarket)
Use a lightweight wallet that connects only to your full node (e.g. Multibit connecting only to your node running at home, Electrum connecting only to your own Electrum server)
So what are you waiting for? The benefits are many, the downsides are not that bad. The more people do this, the more robust and healthy the bitcoin ecosystem is. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:49:43
I hope that this article isn’t right, but even Tone Vays feels that this may impact the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:08:02
Right now it looks like it’s in a much needed consolation state. In any case it is exactly where the market wants it to be. 
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:31:12
Its priced just right.  price might even be a little hot, refer to the 200 week MA.  if you remove all the bubbles and put your chart into log, you will find that 200SMA is a good fit.   just be patient and hold.
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:29:47
Uh, yeah

not too sure about that.  Pretty sure there is way more upside.  Looking at the technicals, news and FOMO are all playing a role here.  
remember that ledgerx was approved.... remember that futures and derivatives will allow ETF's..... remember that some institutions will not join unless they join in at 1bil......  
were just getting started.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:46:19
from coinbase or gdax(the trading platform) you can send BTC to an address.  The address you will send to will be the hardware wallet address.  you should first send a small amount and validate that the small amount transfer was successful.  you can validate using multiple third party sites, even blockchain.info.  Once you have validated that your small amount was successful(20 mins to 30 mins) then give it a go with your full amount. [depending on your OS that you are validating with: Linux, mac, windows..... make sure that you use a the OS's text editor to copy and paste from.  for example, Linux use nano.. Windows use notepad... Mac use textedit].  Good luck mate.  make sure you help your neighbor do the same.  the more people that do this... the more the price will rise. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:05:09
ok... isn't this what lighting is supposed to accomplish?  
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:17:32
since the mempool is no longer being spammed it appears that there is no need for 2mb blocks.  if you are so focused on 2mb, then Segwit will provide you with what you require{educate me if I am wrong here}.
(edit... grammer...)
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:55:58
This is what they call a buy wall. You will see that there are more buyers then sellers. 
This url will give a good explanation

Forgot to mention that it’s really not needed but being paranoid I usually copy the public key then paste it into textpad to make sure there are no hidden characters or spaces.  At that point I copy from textpad then paste the public key into coinbase as the address to send BTC to. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:07:32
Pretty sure i read it here.. looking to see if I find the post again for the 25k limit that was announced  
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:59:22
Really odd that the price keeps tanking regardless of this buy wall. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:13:35
Not even sure it’s needed. Blocks are not full. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:25:45
Yeah. I was trying to be cool and use the lingo everyone else is using here. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:18:08
Check fork.lol    There really isn’t a reason to have a larger block size. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:57:33
yes... that image was price action on gdax..... there is trading happening on a bunch of other exchanges{korea, japan, china...}.
trying to dig a little on this side, but it looks like Japan is dumping.  Looks like it has fallen below their support lines.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:44:01
Might have to give it up now
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:11:40
ah.... coming soon:
use Genesis &lt;genesis
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:39:21
Yes it looks like all the alternative coins are suffering. Just not really convinced that post fork there will be significant value in the new ALT coins based on the current BTC coin. 
Prior to the last fork, there was a significant drop in market value. This go-round there seems to be a major run up in price prior to the fork. 
What are your thoughts on the subject?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:44:01
Could you point me to some metrics that show this?  
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:32:13
For the ‘eventual’ case, I would think that Segwit transactions would assist(signatures no longer included in the block). Along with that I think that lightning will provide the required throughout(space/speed) that a larger block would try to compete with. Your input would be appreciated, would help the OP out

$25k is too low?
then use Genisistrading... min is $25k
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:42:53
Is looking that way. Also look at coindance and view the number of nodes there are for core compared to all he others out there including the 2x. Is really looking like coordinated effort 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:47:31
It’s really about keeping control of your own private keys.
Depending on how soon coinbase will split the coins for you (post fork) it me up already lost its full potential value. Having control of your own keys will enable you to split that coin before coinbase can.
There really isn’t anything wrong with having money on Coinbase. I have money on that exchange. Just as long as you are aware of potential issues on having any crypto currency on an exchange.  For some, coinbase allows a person to get around fees as well as using a debit card to withdraw against your btc on that exchange. 
Just keep hodling. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:48:02
oh yeah... forgot to put this blokes info here.... its very generic, as is your question about what type of hardware wallet is(not that this is bad, this is good that you are not giving away too much info.  )

@_date: 2017-10-21 18:07:07
Pretty sure it’s because the conservatives in the single party system in China are OK with BCash at the moment.
BCash is supposed to be the back up system(full Chinese implementation )for the global trading system that bitcoin is. This is why we saw earlier last month that there were unknown minors mining the BCash, I believe these were in fact minors satisfying the conservative members of the single party system in China. This is just my opinion.
Pretty sure that we are free for lift off and will hit some serious new all-time highs before December is up. So buckle up
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:11:16

@_date: 2017-10-19 16:48:18
Yeah. 35 is a good amount. You might want to try an OTC. Have never used localbitcoin but that might also be an option 
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:21:31

@_date: 2018-07-11 19:24:30
What about Armory?
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:49:07
Yeah. Your right. So many. Each has its own issues but really don’t count on the gold being worth too much. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:56:45
I was hoping that there were options for this as well. I’ve done some searches but have come up with nothing. Hope someone can chime in and point us in the right direction. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:56:37
Honestly it all depends on who you trust or how good your ability is to read code. There are a lot of people on this sub that will use hardware wallets like the treZor or the ledger. Others claim that they are OK with using armory, which is software based. You can use a combination of all. Go ahead and Google cold storage to hot wallet. This would give you a good place to start. Once you were comfortable with what you’ve got, the best is not to share with too many people on what your set up is.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:10:46
The scriptSig which is the witness data that is stripped when a Segwit transaction is issued. This is the size savings that is realized. Looks like scriptSig contains ‘sigs’ along with other data.   OP, hope this helps:

Yeah.  There are some good prices for some alts, but the fomo of not getting the extra coin once forked is hard to pass up.

@_date: 2018-04-23 00:22:08
Very good so far. Although I’ve just been looking at this through my mobile device. I am looking forward to pulling this up on the computer and going to do how you differentiated your data through code as opposed to the other site.   
Otherwise hats off. Very good website I really enjoy looking at it and may continue using it over the other site.
I did look up my obscure coin, and it did come up. I know others have commented on other coins but cannot understand why they were not able to view their coins. I know my coin is not even in the top 100.

I would love to upgrade. I just wanted to get my server back online cause I needed to make a couple of transactions. I think once I get these transactions out of the way I can look into the upgrade. 
I was concerned that my server would not be able to participate because of a block size difference. All its doing is making transactions from its local wallet.
