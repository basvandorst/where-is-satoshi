A large part of the transaction size is made up of the inputs. So if you have more inputs from small mining txs then the size of the transaction would go up. 
If you are only paying a 0.003 fee (static) then the size / fee may be lower than the min relay fee on many nodes. 
Use a dynamic fee (multiply fee amount per kb * size) or use a wallet that can do that for you.

Hi OP,
Ben Chan here, CTO at BitGo. 
If you still have the keycard and the section/box D, we can help you recover the funds. 
To the others reading this thread who will understand: Box D is the passphrase, encrypted by a secret which BitGo has. BitGo does not have Box D, so please do NOT send us the keycard. We will provide you with a flow to help. 
The challenge here is that you no longer possess the email and password to his account. However, if you are able to prove his death and your relationship with him, we can help. 
Please get in touch with support - we are here for you, and have helped others in your situation.
As a final reminder, do not send us the keycard. Only you should have the control of those funds.

I really like this. Old-style giftcards, which are essentially secured by codes (sometimes public) now, seemed unsafe to me. 
As a buyer (from a second hand party), I can now be sure that the ownership transfer is real and the selling party cannot use the code somewhere else. Plus the future possibilities in autodetection with regards to payment are huge. 
Please do this for event tickets too. Kill the scalping fraud!

I think it's fair to expect either sidechains or Bitcoin itself to solve micropayments sooner or later. Also, most of the nodes would only need to keep track of unspents, so (assuming the collected payments go to a larger wallet) it isn't as bad as stuffing the blockchain with fake multisig addresses or using it to store data. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:52:23
great ideas - and you seem to understand what we were going for.
price limit per domain / first time paying would definitely help and should solve it for most cases. please see my comment on the top level.

you don't own the private keys with coinbase vault, so I wouldn't recommend this. Coinbase does have an API to let you add multisig addresses though.. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 07:14:38
For a single Bitcoin, it may not be urgent, but it's good practice to look into getting control of your coins (this means taking control of your key). 
Transfer it out from the exchange into your own (hopefully multisig) wallet!

you would have to hit each uri link to get the headers. some browsers do prefetch so maybe this is acceptable but we'd have to think more about it due to the costs. 
perhaps when hovering over a link like that it can prefetch headers and tell you in advance. combined with per-domain limiting (explicit accept for new domains) I think it'd make for a decent client experience. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 07:24:56
This is true to some extent, and I use BCI for testing and small amounts of daily spending. 
However, some wallets are easier to secure than others, with a mix of ease of use / security tradeoffs. BCI just isn't enough to the "security" side of the mix for 100 coins.

Even though you claim not to store it, the client still sends it to you, so trust is required when using the HSM option. This is the case when typing in my passphrase to sign with keys created using the offline generation tool as well. 
To be safe, the decryption and signing should happen client side, in the browser, even if you keep the keys encrypted. At no point should multiple decrypted keys be available to a single other party than the owner of the funds.

still thinking about this. one way is to have the real price appear in a tooltip when you mouseover on the link. and we can have the limits work  per domain (with user confirmation the first time per domain), and better messaging of the amount charged. 
keep in mind that the amounts here are in micropayments so the overcharge amount would be limited, and pose a severe risk to the merchant reputation. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 12:24:42
Ben here, developer that made the video. Thank you for your kind words. We had a lot of fun making this at the YC Hackathon earlier this year, I felt it was a sneak peak into our Bitcoin future. Since then then we have mostly gone into full-time jobs with companies in the crypto space. 
At this point we have a protocol spec, but much work needs to be done before it is a functioning product. IMO the following would be required: 
* Protocol whitepaper
* Proper chrome extension to be open sourced (what we have is too hacky), needs domain-based limiting, better UI messaging to the customer he paid/is paying etc.
* Middleware libraries (nodejs, python packages etc) to implement protocol server-side
* Demo site and professional front to get merchants to accept it
Is there anyone who wants to work on this? 
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:14:39
Other than the trust requirement, I seem to be having problems with removing my multisig account. I created one for the testing the HSM but I wanted to try the other key models. 
But when I remove it I get:
This account has a balance of ฿ 0.0005 BTC so it cannot be closed yet.
Please transfer the funds out of this account first.
But when I try to send coins out I get:
Sorry, that account is empty (no confirmed balance at present).
Another thing that would be great for your users in general is to make setting up 2FA / OTP more prominent or required. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:31:52

There are 2 calculations involved - one for the transaction to be included in the block and other for the chance it gets relayed. These are both related to the 0.001 fee. 
See details here:
you seem to be on the right track that this isn't the best option for relaying simple signal data. 
Bitcoin after all is a P2P network in which every node must get a (more or less) consistent view and store the entire blockchain - this type of usage wouldn't scale and so the fees are in there to prevent that. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 21:17:34

Low hanging fruit: faster confirms, more tx/second, increased tx payload can all be implemented first on sidechains (too much inertia against change on main chain). 
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:25:56
I could be wrong but I noticed my passphrase being transmitted to Coinkite at the point of signing. so in theory, they would have access to the 2 keys in the HSM+passphrase option and you would need to trust them more than BitGo.
Anyway, whoever you go with, I'd recommend increasing the number of required keys if you have 6 available. 2 of 3 is a lot safer than 2 of 6 or even 3 of 6. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:21:21
this is a great conversation to have. it would also save on the mining fee which is important with microtransactions. downside was complexity - simplicity is important if anyone is going to implement it. Also, would you have the client set up a payment channel with every domain/merchant? that may be cumbersome, but if you only do it once, then it'd be centralized. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 12:30:49
good thinking. I too considered this, and one solution is to have a spending limit per domain, and require user confirmation for new domains. 
also - better info to the user when he is getting charged and what is going on. we didn't get to that.

when you are in wallet setup, click advanced and you can provide one xpub there with no xpriv. 
the key generation happens client side on the browser for the other key and encrypted to send to the server. this can be verified using chrome devtools/etc. via the api you can also submit only public keys but if you do that then you'll need to sign all txes manually. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:07:40
thank you :)
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:37:31
The demo is real and on-chain. I found that the txs did propagate fast enough to be feasible especially if you use a good data source, and a whole lot faster than loading a credit card page / typing in etc. 
there are other problems with the implementation as mentioned above but this particular issue is actually well-served by Bitcoin.

you're right about the 30-50 articles case. Although not shown it is possible server-side to charge once for n articles (and not send the header on the subsequent n) which reduces that. my thoughts are that longer term either bitcoin or a sidechain will solve micropayments and this will be much more possible.

First, let's decouple the use of Multisig from the audit discussion. Multisig wallet balances where the addresses are generated in a known BIP32 HD scheme are simple to audit.
Now to answer your main discussion:
When a hacker gains access to their server and tries to withdraw the funds, a single signature will be applied and passed onto the second multi-sig signer for co-signing, where security can be applied. This security could take the form of policies such as:
* Rate limits:
Slows the flow of funds being stolen. 
* Callbacks to the spender's server:
Signing service verifies with the original spender that they initiated and intended to make the spend. The callback could go to a separated machine, which could only contain access to isolated approved withdrawal information. 
* IP limiting:
The signing service only signs transactions coming from a certain list of IPs, preventing the case where the hacker or insider stole the private key. 
* Destination whitelists:
Certain very high security wallets can be set such that the signing service would only accept if the destination were previously known. The hacker would have to compromise both the original sending server as well as the signing service. 
The actual level of security depends on the policies put in place and/or combination of them. The requirement for exchanges is operational wallets, not cold wallets where funds only go in and keys are never used. It is not impossible for a hacker to jump through all the hoops, but at the end of the day maybe they only get a trickle of funds.
If a single key was used, stealing that alone and creating one huge transaction would be all that's needed to end the show.

i see the motivation for this, but it can be very dangerous if nDepthLimit is not set to a sufficiently high value. 
consider the current situation where it may take several blocks to get a confirmation - this would mean that during the time waiting for confirmation of an OUTGOING transaction, further outgoing transactions may be rejected.
Mary wants to pay friends in BTC with her wallet. She purchased 10 BTC from an exchange, and this one unspent gets sent to her wallet. She wants to pay A, B, C, D, E etc (say, 5 people). If nDepthLimit is 3, she can send to A, B, and C without waiting for confirmations but the transaction to D will be rejected because it hasn't been confirmed yet. So now you need to tell her to wait for a confirmation which could take (potentially very long) in the current Bitcoin network environment. 
And 
1) she'll be unhappy because she'll need to wait and 
2) that's assuming she understands the limitation at all.

That case would be fine because their system would know all recipients beforehand and create a single large transaction. 
But consider the case where the software doesn't know all the recipients beforehand (as it often is in most clients).  This could place a virtual limit on the number of transactions that can be sent before a confirmation.

We (BitGo) have investigated this issue and determined it to be a bug introduced over a year ago in our fork of bitcoinjs-lib. The exact line of the cause is here: 
We had since fixed this bug in April 22, 2014 (a month later) here:  However, we missed updating the reference to this fix in the legacy recovery tool.
The root cause of the problem occurred during the output value serialization step when the redeem transaction was constructed. During the process of converting the number into bytes for use in the transaction, bitwise operators were used in this old version of the code, which converted the output value (in satoshis) to a 32 bit int, causing an integer overflow and truncating the output of 10227087437 satoshis (102.27 btc) to 1637152845 satoshis (16.37 btc).

@_date: 2016-10-20 07:21:48
The reason why miners will include the empty block is because it still counts for work. Which means that it counts as a confirmation for txs in previous blocks, and consensus says that we follow the chain with the longest work. If a miner builds off the chain without the empty block he increased his risk of orphans. 
You could try to make empty blocks count for no work, which as others have pointed out can simply result in miners including a single tx and so on.

Would it be used for consumer micropayments, automated machine to machine payments, a substitute for ads and subscriptions? With the fee environment today it wouldn't work anymore without a micropayment channel. No one knew and we're still figuring out a killer app. 
The first half of 2015 was pretty quiet in this area, but over the next 6 months we will see renewed interest in this, with many companies (e.g. 21, Coinbase, and some other wallet providers) looking into this.

Largest local bank. ( is citibank iirc)
Also interesting: Temasek holdings (sovereign wealth fund) owns a significant portion (11.6%) of DBS (the bank organizing this).

There are many cheap sources of bandwidth overseas. Plenty of VPS/dedicated server providers oversell bandwidth. It may not be low-latency, but good throughput is all that's needed here. 
This situation could make bandwidth arbitrage a real possibility.

Yes, the protocol and extension will be.

i love this. with the ledger being public, it would be trivial to now check which gift cards were used. 
i wish this could also be applied to concert / festival tickets. i hate going to an event only to find out i'd been sold a fake.

I'm in the bay area. Wanted to try the Open source exchange out. Not sure what i'll do right away but I think Bitspark will want to use it :)

This is true, but hard drive space has also dropped significantly over the past 6 years. 
I wonder how far ahead we are on utxo pruning?

Thanks for your work Daniel!

Is the lack of bandwidth a problem commonly noticed in Popcorn time?

If you're talking about Zeroclick, that was me. Since then we have a protocol spec and volunteers working on it. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 09:57:57
This is the best solution imo, short of deploying signed apps.

how will this work? if they are using a pooled wallet model now for everyone's main wallet, there's no concept of customer wallets (on chain) so how do I know that the large amount they move is part of my wallet? 
xygo's solution or the merkle tree approach look good here.

I would reckon it is an attempt to investigate various wallet providers/exchanges to see how they handle it. Some providers may not clean up the old (pre-malleated) tx, resulting in double-counting of unconfirmed balances. 
Another potential attack could be mt-gox style (well, nobody believes it really was the cause of their downfall):
* Withdraw coins from the exchange, get the initial txId, malleate that.
* Complain to the exchange later that "funds were not received". 
* If the exchange only uses the initial txId, then they could be fooled into resending the funds. 
A workaround is to use a normalized txId (hash of tx inputs and outputs without signatures) to identify a transaction.

With coinbase or circle they hold your keys and implement account security through passwords and 2fa. With multisig providers you hold your keys AND there is still account security through passwords and 2fa. 
But I see your point about being held under duress. If you don't want to spend your coins on a daily basis, you can create bitgo or coinkite Wallets with offline keys you store in vaults. Alternatively, get other users to approve transactions out of your multisig wallet.

Major improvements:
* Headers first synchronization - faster and more robust initial sync
* Dynamic transaction fee calculation - fees no longer hardcoded, scales with demand
* Watch-only addresses - Track any address using the wallet, not just your own
* Consensus library - abstracted interface for verification on a full node
* More script opcodes considered standard - more power for programmable money
* Improved security - libsecp256k1, non-DER signatures prohibited

+1 on this. 
Not alerting the user when an RBF transaction is leaving them open to huge risk and misunderstanding. RBF transactions are designed to be double spent. 
Alternative would be not show the transaction until it is confirmed.

Well, take from it what you will, even with the bias. 
I'll state what I got out of it: 
Running a community-curated platform that rewards creators is a challenge. Creating, funding and maintaining a blockchain is hard. 
Use Bitcoin, take the blockchain uncertainty out of the equation.

I was wondering about this too, just yesterday me and the GF were watching the anime and the label on Ash's sleeping bag had the name "satoshi" on it.

Poloniex is targeting high volume traders and speculators.
Coinbase is trying to be the gateway for the man on the street to make bitcoin/cryptocurrency accessible to them.
Different business models and different success points - cannot compare simply based on "volume".

For the record (so we can look at this in the future), OP is saying he sold them at 120.

Could someone explain to me this options tab:
Option ID 	Expiration 	Cost 	Qty 	Strike 	Premium
PUT  	3 d, 13 h, 33 m 	1.71500000 	1 	1.40000000 	0.31500000
It costs 1.715 to buy a put with a 1.4 strike? that would never break even, would it.

Suggestion: Let's find statistics of claimed tips on bctip. If only 33% of tips are being collected, one can tip a proportional amount each time (in this case, 300% of the tip). 
The hardworking ones who claim up stand to gain the spoils, and everyone is net even.
