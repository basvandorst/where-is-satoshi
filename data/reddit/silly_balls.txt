I am very familiar with audit reports. Hell I fucking write them. Everything you just said is false. The "preliminary report" (not what that was by the way, we don't usually issue a report on preliminary audits) was an AUP not an audit. An AUP is where parties agree on the procedures to be performed and auditors are merely stating which procedures were preformed and any findings. Since you are not a party to the original agreement we place a restriction on the report that basically says "If you weren't in on this dont rely on this". 
Sure there were no findings in this report. However that does not answer even the most basic of audit questions.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:27:22
If our ability to trust management erodes, thats usually a big one. We know management will try to pull some bullshit hell we expect it, but once it gets to a certain level then we will break. It is a process however, and not a decision we make just willy nilly.
Usually we try to work with management to clear the air. If that doesn't work we go to the audit committee or the board and let them know the issues we are having, and what we need them to do to fix it. If that doesn't work then we will probably bounce.
It is incredibly rare that this happens. I have done audits for 20 years and my firm does probably 600-700 audits in a year, and we have done it 1 time since I have been there. So when you hear the auditors have left, watch out!!!
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:36:08
I mean sure it's possible. Then again if I am the type to run off with the money do you think I am above forging whatever documents I need to? That is why the audit was so important. Its a third party that is knowledgeable of the most common scams that says "eh, shit looks right". 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:33:06


Bullshit. You know what takes longer than an audit once fieldwork has started? Dropping the fucking auditor and finding a new one. The only time I have heard of clients dropping an auditor in the middle of fieldwork is when they are opinion shopping. When the auditor drops the client...HOLY SHIT YOU BETTER TAKE NOTICE!!!! We very rarely drop the client. We try to get the client to drop us first... BFX will try to find another auditor. The new auditor will be required to talk to the previous auditor. Depending on the nature of what went down BFX may find it impossible to ever get another auditor.

Hmmm.... Me thinks you dont work in finance at all. You seem to not know how front running works, or how an exchange as large as bitfinex could be both buying and selling on its own platform keeping the prices higher.

Coins sold on Bitfinex will be credit the seller USDT not USD. So if sell orders of BTC are placed, BFX can front run the order with the tethers it holds. Bfx now has the bitcoins and stabilizes the price, by buying out all orders below a certain point. It can then sell the BTC whenever it wants to using the same process. All of this is for worthless USDT to its customers.

They have no US banking relationships. Acquiring 2 billion in USD without access to an American bank is fairly difficult

They may. That is possible. However when you traded 20k worth of bitcoin for 20k worth of tether, only to turn around and trade that 20k worth of tether for 10k worth of bitcoin, and you see the bitcoin price falling, what are you likely to do? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:54:03
The problem is who are you entrusting that coin too? For banks it's easy. If your bank goes bust the federal government will step in and make you whole (up to a certain amount). Who is going to provide that kind of insurance in the crypto world? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:26:17


Basically the exact definition of why it is not a liability... A liability is an obligation with expected transfer of economic benefits including money, goods or services. Equity is not a liability. That's why it is not contained in the balance sheet under "Liabilities". 
And you are off. If a company is in bankruptcy or stops operations equity holders receive money last. Usually there is nothing left, however that is not always the case. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:11:40


Hmm... If only they had some type of audit to tell us if this was the case... Oh well, I guess we will just have to take bfxs word for it.  Although I do find it a little odd how they got 2.2 billion without a banking relationship, but that's none of my business

@_date: 2018-01-30 20:26:32
No they will buy up BTC with increasing amounts of tether. The spread will start to widen between the exchanges, just like it did with GOX. Once they have the BTC they will move those to USD/BTC sites like Coinbase, where they will most likely sell. Rinse repeat price comes crashing down as the liquidity dries up.

You are close. The IRS issued a "John Doe" summons to coinbase, which would have given them information on all users. Coinbase fought this summons in court so the IRS filed a "Notice of Narrowed Summons Request for Enforcement" with the court. This narrowed the scope to only individuals with 20k or more on the exchange. 
HOWEVER depending on what the IRS finds this will not end. If the majority of those users didn't claim bitcoin gains (They didn't only 800 people in the world claimed bitcoin gains and the IRS subpoenaed ~14,000 records) The IRS will use this as proof that it should be allowed to go after more and more users over more and more years. 
TLDR: If you used Coinbase and didn't claim the gain, The IRS is about to get up in them buttcheeks.

@_date: 2017-01-12 23:46:00
Okay. What you are asking about is what is called a section 1031 "like kind exchange". We have a few things to work out 
1) are you in the business of selling bitcoins? As in do you make your primary income from bitcoins? 
My guess is no unless you are like a bitcoin coin broker or some shit so you pass the first test. Next 
2) Was the disposition of the relinquished property and acquisition of the replacement property mutually dependent parts of an integrated transaction constituting an exchange of property? Did you pay for the physical bitcoin with the digital one? Or did you sell the digital and then use the money from that to purchase the physical? I'm assuming you used your bitcoin to make the purchase so you will pass this test. 
Here's were it starts to get a little messy. 
3) Is this a like kind transaction? The IRS probably, would not go for this. My guess is that they will view this as if someone went from a gold ETF to a gold bar. In which case the full gain is taxable at the time of the transaction. 
However since you paid 125 for the coin and gave up an electronic coins with a value of 125 no taxable transaction has occurred. Your basis in the coin is 125. A year goes by and you sell your coin to get 1.35 BTC, spot 1000. You are giving up 125 to get 1335 this is a taxable gain of 1210, and that would be due in the year the coin was exchanged for the electronic btc. 
Now if the IRS will consider this as a like kind exchange. It is possible but I don't know? Then you would have a deferred gain of 1210 and your basis would be 1335. You would include this deferred gain in your income when you sold for the coin for cash. 
So B in your interpretation is the closest answer, however there is a lot more that goes into it than that.  
EDIT: The 125 original basis is an assumption that you purchased the original 1.25 bitcoin for cash.

Consent of users or mining power? Cause I was under the impression that it was mining power that decided the rules, and bitcoiners merely substituted that for democracy?

I think you are very much wrong. I think the IRS will show that X bitcoins have moved through the exchange, which should have generated Y revenue, and they only have claims for Z amount. 
Plus the IRS already narrowed it's focus. They only want certain records of certain transactions. That is more to appease the courts than anything else. As once they have those records, and have findings they will broaden the scope and ask for them all again. Coinbase is going to hope they are not charged at the end of this
They have gotten have more with far less.

You are assuming an outside entity is trying to hack in. For something like this you should be worried about an internal employee. See most institutions in charge of holding money, are required to have an integrated audit of financial statements and internal controls. Spend millions on all security you want. It will not do a lick of good if Authorization, Recording, and Control are not separated. As far as I know Coinbase does not have such an audit.
A knowledgeable insider, who knows where controls are weak, is far more dangerous than any outside entity. Thats what you should be worried about

The problem is the huge upfront costs. All the mining equipment ain't cheap. Setting up that kinda facility is going to be very costly. Then  you have to pay people to maintain it, and I'm guessing the overlap between electricral and computers is miniscule so you are brining in all new people. You have to then sell the bitcoins, and go through the tax headaches that can cause, assuming they don't get stolen. All of this is completely ignoring the fact that in the long run it will be a net zero proposition. So unless the company can make a shit in the short run its not going to be worth it to even try
@_date: 2017-01-14 23:45:35
If you knew anything about the tax code you would realize how silly this is. It would be fucking impossible to determine. Furthermore, whether the gains are on assets or foreign currency. The real questions is how each will be taxed. Right now bitcoin has capital gains/ losses treatment. With this two tiered system you would either get it taxed at capital gains (the best rates) or ordinary income (the worst rates). You are basically asking the for IRS to let you do more paperwork at a higher tax rate.

Your's is a great example for OP see my above answers. This would be different from OPs case as exchanging gold bars for smaller gold bars is basically the definition of a like kind exchange. The gain would be deferred until you started selling those coins. However you got cash too. In this case we take the gain up to the cash received and that is taxable and the rest is deferred. 
EX) you had a 10oz bar that you purchased for 100 per oz. You gave up that bar, for 10-1oz gold coins, spot of 200 and 100 dollars in cash. Your gain would be what you got (200x10 + 100) minus what you gave up (100x10). So you would have a gain of 1100. However only 100 of that gain would be recognized in the current year, the rest would be deferred.

Look at McD's. Say the start taking bitcoin. They have to reprogram thousands of pos terminals, and they have to retrain thousands of employees. Now everyone knows McD's has shit food, but people go because it's quick. They wanted each car to wait no more than a minute from order to leaving. Adding another payment option complicates this, especially bitcoin. So they risk losing business by taking bitcoin. Now if the benefits out weigh the costs they will do it. It's their some huge pent up demad to buy shit burgers, that McD's is missing out on? no. 99% of the people with bitcoin have cash, CC, Gift cards, etc... so they stand to gain nothing while they are putting quite a lot on the line

A currencies value is determined by a lot of things.  what you can do with it. Having American monies means you have access to American markets, which can provide you anything you want. Having Uzbekistanian money, gives you access to anything you may want from Uzbekistan. It's easy to see why one is considered better than the other. 
Having bitcoins allows you access to... Nothing. Okay well it does allow for drug purchases so that is a thing, I'll give it that. So what is the cause for such a rapid increase? Has the market for drugs outpaced the supply of bitcoins? I doubt it. So what change occurred that has sent the price skyward? No major regulations came out that preferred bitcoin, quiet the opposite. No major vendors started taking bitcoin, quite the opposite.
The price shouldn't be moving, let alone shooting up

No it's not. What did you buy and when, for how much? What did you sell and when, for how much? Which method did you elect LIFO or FIFO, and then its done. The answer is almost always FIFO, unless you just really want to pay the short term rate? 
FUCK you weighted average, fuck right off with that fucking nightmare of a thing. Who wants to do more work for less tax savings? 
Do you guys know anything about the tax code? Right now bitcoin is subject to capital gains... IE THE BEST RATES YOU CAN GET!!! What are you complaining about? If you do not have the full history that is not the fault of the IRS that is on you.

Now wait if you are trading say a BTC coin  for BTC coin  Then you are right that is not a gain. The conversion from digital to physical is what results in the recognition. For example exchanging rental real estate for rental real estate is a like kind. Exchanging rental real estate for an empty lot is not


 
Said every single accountant ever... Don't even get us started on lease accounting.


And yet, I think it's the same as the first example above, where BTC are exchanged for BTC.  
 
It seems the same but the way the IRS would view it, I'm not sure (my guess is no). My guess is they are looking at in one case electronic representation of a coin vs physical coin, The closest I can think would be Gold ETF to Gold bars, the other would be gold bars for gold bars, and that certainly counts. 
Now I wouldn't consider myself a tax expert. I do taxes only when I finish my audits, and the tax dept needs help. I know enough to not to make a complete fool of myself, and most rules, and where to find the info, but I could be missing something like a revenue ruling or IRS notice that provides more clarity on this situation. So take what I have said with some salt, if you are in this boat, ask a tax CPA and let them figure it out. 
Additionally if you have a cool 10k lying around you could request a private letter ruling. If you ask me this is type of stuff that the bitcoin foundation should be doing.

So basically these companies don't take bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:05:26
No problem. I would certainly advise consulting a bitcoin tax CPA. I don't know how many of them are out there, but they will usually apply other examples that are close enough. You could be right. I mean if I give you my harddrive with 1000 btc in exchange for a 1000 btc private code written on paper, that doesn't seem like it would count as a 1031. However what if I exchange bitcoin for LTC, they are both digital tokens? That seems like it would come closer to a 1031 then the first example. However I don't think anyone could say btc and ltc are "like kind"? That is like exchanging Apple stock for Exxon. It is an interesting thing to consider, and now I'm curious and I'm going to look into this a bit more. It could simply be an issue of IRS regs being in place since before Reagan and they just haven't caught up yet. I'll let you know if I find anything more.

Yes the users are the ones in hot water. Basically the IRS saw the price go from 100 to 1000 noted how many transactions, and customers coinbase had. Which was probably achieved by both looking at the blockchain and coinbases public statements, and then compared that data to its own records. Coinbase claims to have millions of users and supporting over 10 million in transactions, the IRS had 815 people file capital gains from BITCOIN!!! 
Something doesn't add up so now the IRS is on the hunt. They originally asked for all records. The government said "nah thats too much", So they asked for people with over 20k in transactions. If this fails they will keep making the scope smaller and smaller until they get a bite. Once they have the records they are going to put faces to names and shit will rocket fanward quick. Depending on the number and %  of findings they have they will either finish the investigation, or go back to the court and ask to expand the scope, which they will get, now they have all the records and people are seriously fucked. 
Coinbase maybe held responsible if the government can show that they knowingly helped people avoid taxes. That is going to be incredibly hard. Coinbase has a very good reason as to why they can not 1099 people. 
Basically If you used coinbase in 2013-2014 and you didnt pay capital gains tax, now would be a really good time to file an amended return 
EDIT: Coinbase wants this over quick (shit costs yo, and who really wants the IRS breathing down your neck?) so they offered an olive branch to coinbase, saying they will 1099 from here on out. My bet is the IRS doesnt take them up on it, but as the dates for resolving this keep getting pushed back, the IRS is going to start losing enforcement options. Maybe they relent, maybe they don't.

The IRS rules on bitcoin are no different than anything else. N2014 is just a clarification and doesn't update add or modify any rules. So yes its accounted for. The reason I say it depends is because I can't say "yes or no" without knowing the specifics. As there are exemptions with exemptions, and the second that I say "yes" you are going to find the one.

From the IRS perspective in that scenario, it will be looked at as a taxable transaction. Unless you have a way of proving you are in control of the wallet that said bitcoin was transferred to. However you are right in that if he purchased the bitcoin for 1300 and immediately transferred it at 1300 the tax is zero. So he is in the clear with owing any monies. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:29:25
Again that's not the IRS concern, they issued guidelines in 2014 that said "this is what you have to do". If you used bitcoin in such a way as to make reporting more difficult for you, than you should have considered the tax implications of such a plan, and factored that into your cost calculations

True. and that is what I meant when I said coinbase cant really 1099. If you buy a coin on coinbase, move it off, move it back on. Coinbase would have to count it as a "sale". And your right again in that the IRS is going to have trouble knowing if you sold, or just moved them.
I think the numbers are whats so alarming. Only 815 people filed taxes for bitcoin... fucken hell.
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:48:31
No one is talking about forensics dipshit. Coinbase has all your identifying info. Name, DOB, drivers license, bank information. Those details are assigned to an account. That account has activity, that activity is what the IRS is going to be looking for. So a coin entering a coinbase account for Billy Joe when the FMV is 1000, and that coin leaving that account when the FMV is 1300 will produce a taxable transaction of 300. So no you fucking dipshit numbnuts, forensics doesn't enter into the equation. Unless you consider is 1000&lt;1300 as being some NCIS shit. What a fucking cock gobbler you are.   
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:46:47
Depends. So when you first buy you establish what is known as a "basis". This is the amount above which will be considered a gain. Example: I buy a chair for 200 (basis) and sell it a month later for 1000 my taxable gain is selling price - basis in this case 800. 
That 800 will either be taxed as a short term capital gain or long term capital gain. Depends on time, and this affects what the tax is. Max is 39.6% 
I'm guessing that you didn't buy 5k all at once but instead bought over a period of time. If you purchased the bitcoin immediately transferred it out and used it to gamble and lost you would not owe anything. So in a few examples
Ex1) I buy 1 bitcoin at 1000, wait six months and transfer it to a gambling site, at this time the 1 btc is worth 1200, and I use that to buy 1200 worth of chips, and lose it all. In that case I have a taxable transaction of 200 which will be taxed either short or long term (max 39.6%)
Ex2) I buy 1 bitcoin at 1000, immediately send it to a gambling site and purchase 1000 worth of chips. I lose it all. I do not have a taxable gain 
Ex3) I buy 1 bitcoin at 1000, immediately send it to a gambling site and purchase 1000 worth of chips. I win 10,000. In this case I have a gambling gain which is  treated completely differently than capital gain. 
So at worst, assuming you got 5k in bitcoin for free, they were short term and you made &gt;415,000 in income for that year, you would be looking at owing around 2k + penalties and fees. 
If you got 5k worth of chips, and paid 5k for the bitcoins you should owe nothing more. Provided you did not win.

@_date: 2016-12-03 06:25:19
Yall should both be careful cause a casualty/ theft loss is actually the lesser of:
The adjusted basis of your property, or
The decrease in fair market value of your property as a result of the casualty
In a theft the FMV after the theft is zero, in a casualty the FMV would take into account any salvage. Both of them take into account any reimbursements, and casualty losses must be: **Sudden, unexpected, or unusual** I seriously doubt a computer shitting the bed counts on any of these points, seeing as how 99.9% of termite damage does not count.
A sudden event is one that is swift, not gradual or progressive.
An unexpected event is one that is ordinarily unanticipated and unintended.
An unusual event is one that isn't a day-to-day occurrence and that isn't typical of the activity in which you were engaged.

I edited the post to indicate that I mean the capital gains portion. Attempting to hide income from the IRS is a crime in itself. I don't think a case has ever been brought to the courts regarding bitcoin and tumblers but my feeling is that the use of a tumbler in itself will be viewed as attempting to hide income. It will probably trigger some type of investigation. Even still I know I don't want to be the first guy trying to explain to 12 people what a bitcoin is and why a tumbler is "totes legit". If you want to be the guinea pig be my guess. It will probably not work out in your favor.

If you buy and immediately transfer than you are right you have no taxable gain. Whether the IRS will actually follow that coin (my guess is they will to some extent), I can't say. All I can say is that the rules would require you to value the coin at the time you exchange it for goods or services, which could lead to a taxable transaction if the coin has changed in value. If you choose not to do this, then that is on you. As a CPA I would advise against it.

This should not get you in trouble if you are following IRS guidance from N 21-2014. If you are not than that is your issue. It doesnt matter what coinbase calls it, it matters what the IRS says.

Bruce don't give advice you are not qualified to give please. Charitable contributions can get a little tricky. Here's a very basic [flowchart]( 
First it must be a qualified charity, specific requirements exist for amounts over 250. Furthermore determining what amount is deductible can be a little tricky, but the basic rules are: 
1) At Fair Market Value (FMV) when FMV is below basis. 
2) At basis when FMV exceeds basis and property would  result in a short term capital gain or ordinary if sold.
3) Long term gain if sold, the amount is FMV
You also have AGI restrictions, AMT concerns. It's not simply as a easy as just "writing it off".

On form 8949 which flows to Schedule D of your 1040. You will list the bitcoin, your basis, the sale, and the FMV at the time. 
From the IRS perspective it will look like I profited from BTC when I moved a bunch from Coinbase to Poloniex....
Depending on when you bought and sold yes it may. You will need to keep backup to substantiate that you moved coins from an account you control to an account that you control 
but I lost a lot of those BTC, do I still pay taxes on it? 
Only on the portion of capital gains
Would my tax return specify what part of my due taxes are going towards 'assumed' BTC profits?

@_date: 2016-12-01 15:18:19
As a CPA let me first breakdown your misunderstanding of the tax code. We start with "All income from whatever source derived is taxable unless excluded" the remaining pages are the exclusions.  
That first line is genius as it shifts the burden of proof to you. What the IRS is going to show is that the person who owns wallet 123 at coinbase is btcchef. Wallet 123 received 1 bitcoin when the price was 10 therefore his basis in 1 bitcoin is 10.00. A transfer of one bitcoin took place at a price of 1300.00. Therefore the taxable gain is 1290.00. Now if you really did transfer that one bitcoin from your wallet to another wallet you own, no big deal. That is not a taxable transaction. However if you can not prove that you own that wallet then you will owe the tax on that 1290.00. This is the way it works and you can piss and moan about it all day, but it will not change that fact. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:23:37
None of that is the IRS's problem, they issued the guidance in 2014 and told you what they wanted. You are required to maintain accurate records of all these various transactions. If you did not then they are going to calculate the bill and it's probably not going to be in your favor. So from here going forward keep accurate up to date records on all your bitcoin transactions.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:26:54
You were required to. If you didn't I'm sure they will pull a price that is not favorable to you and use that. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:15:52
Okay let's backup I think we might be talking past each other. The IRS is not going to demand to see what you spent money on. They don't care. What they are going to do is say "1 bitcoin entered your account when the price was 1000, .5 bitcoin left when the price was 1500, so you have a taxable transaction of 250.00. The other half left when bitcoin was @ 2000.00, which is a taxable transaction of 500. Therefore you owe tax on $750.00 the first bitcoin entered your account on 1/1/16 and left on 3/21/16 and 12/31/16 therefore the gain will be taxed as a short term gain, which is taxed as ordinary income so you owe X. 
Now where we hit problems is if this bitcoin is not "bought" on coinbase but instead transferred in. Then the question is "where did it come from?". If you can't/won't prove where it came from then the IRS can simply set your basis to 0.00 in which case you have a gain of 2000, and will be taxed on that 2000 as ordinary income. If you are mining them then they may consider you carrying on bitcoin as a trade/business, which would subject you to the reporting requirements. Remember all they have to prove is that you owned bitcoin at this time and moved/transferred/sold it at another time. The rest is on you, and if you don't like the assumptions they are going to make than you better have information to dispute the claim.

They don't ~~let it ride~~ HODL. That's what gamblers do.  
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:07:15
No just giving you enough rope to hang yourself with. Keep in mind CPA's go down for tax evasion, with plans much more complex than "move coins around a bunch". What makes you think you are smarter than them? Keep in mind that the second those coins go to a tumbler they have left your control and they are now taxed at for a capital gain. So if you tumble 1 coin then in the eyes of the IRS you have just sold 1 coin, and will be taxed on any gain (doesn't matter if you get the exact same coin back) as you transferred goods (your bitcoin) for a service (tumbling). Again good luck but you are going to wind up with a higher tax bill playing this game than if you were just straight legit.

Must itemize deductions: take casualty loss, less 100 dollars, less 10% agi, less recovery or reimbursement = Allowable casualty theft loss not to exceed income and if it does then you have a NOL which you can carry forward.

You want to see unpractical look at the entire way we pay taxes. Your employer sends you and the IRS a W-2, yet somehow the IRS still needs you to fill out a separate form telling them what the info on your w-2 says... Yeah I don't make these rules I just have to follow them. If you ever want to get really pissed off simply look at any exemption to a certain tax rule. That shit might as well be a list of "who could pay off enough congressmen to get this exemption placed here". Don't even get me started on trying to figure out the "basis" for partnerships, that stuff can spin your head around. 
The only problem with your plan is that if you are going to say bitcoin X went to wallet Y which I also own, they are going to say "oh goodie show us all of wallet Y's transactions please" eventually they are going to get what they want.

9/10 times if the amount is small the irs will send you a letter and say "You said you owe this, we calculated this. if you agree sign and pay or make a payment plan. If you disagree tell us why we are wrong."

Heres the thing about that whole "public ledger". The IRS is able to point to X transactions that should generate Y revenue, then they compare that to Z remittances and if those don't jive we gots an issue.

This is not how the IRS audits, or audits in general work. They don't audit nothing.

You have no fucking idea what your talking about. Have you ever heard the term "going concern"? You can usually spot a problem from miles away! Negative cash flow, negative operating income are two of the biggest. 
And blockchain "auditing" doesn't do shit if its not paired with other procedures. IE can you be sure the company didn't get a loan to buy up enough bitcoins? That's a huge problem, but it would satisfy the requirements of the "audit" 
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:28:40
Its actually worse than that, and far cheaper. For some perspective, Visa alone generated 17 mil per day in NET income. The only thing visa has to do is increase the fee over 5-10% per transaction. It would make no sense to spend an extra 5-10% using bitcoin to buy from overstock, Tigerdirect, etc... when using a CC would save you money! Furthermore, it doesn't have to be a sustained attack. Just attack bitcoin at peak traffic times, and slow the entire thing down, when people are trying to use it the most. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:28:18
Oh oh god! did you just compare BV to solvency! BV is what the company will return on a share in a liquidation! Meaning that right now if BoA said "fuck it we're out" each share could expect to get 24.00. It's kinda meaningless as the assets are held on historical cost, and usually sell for much higher (land) or much lower (if valuation accounts were off base). EX) buying a building in downtown Manhattan in 1850, is a lot cheaper than it would be today. 
You can measure solvency with some ratios, the best is arguably the current ratio. CA/CL right now BoA has a current ratio of 1.347 anything over 1 means a company has enough cash/cash equivalents to pay off its debt in the coming year. If you're looking for liquidity than you want to use an acid test. 
In no situation is BV used to determine solvency!

@_date: 2015-08-11 16:13:27


First of all none of that has to do with the original discussion regarding solvency, but nevertheless
 
Unlike Bitcoin I don't require a belief in anything. Yeah its a steal at 20 if that's the only thing you are looking at, but again more goes into my pricing equation than just BV&gt;Market. For instance, see that big portion of "goodwill"? You know goodwill is simply paying more for a company than its worth, right? So normally I remove items such as that from the equation, and rely more so on tangible book value. Also I have concerns that with all the acquisitions that occurred during the financial crisis, that potential liabilities for litigation might not be recorded. Again I understand the accounting rules about when and how these things happen and I also know the games companies play with this number. Furthermore, see those preferred shares? Again that changes the equation! BoA will NEVER be liquidated. I wish it was shattered into a million pieces, but facts are facts, BoA could give Obama a Cleveland Steamer in the rose garden, and we would still bail them out. So I don't expect BV to EVER be realized. BoA dividend is shit on a tripe sandwich, so unless I'm happy with my money returning a .51% then I should look elsewhere. Or like I said in my last post BV is not really that useful.

You seem to be missing the point. I never said they wouldn't lie. But why assume something is a lie? Here is a question for you? Would you say your car becomes more worthless as each year goes by in a linear fashion? Or do you lose the most value out of a car within the first year? Can you accurately predict who will win a lawsuit, and the resulting dollar amount? When a company issues a warranty can you accurately determine the cost of servicing those warranties? What about PBO, or  deferred taxes, or collectible accounts? All those are judgement calls and two different people given the same information can come to two different conclusions. No lying needs to take place to get different results. Just different methods of approaching an equation.

Regulation is what makes DUE DILIGENCE possible! It's because of things like valuations/ disclosures/ presentation/ reporting requirements (all regs) that make it possible and worth wild. Your essentially saying that all monopoly games would run the same if monopoly had no rules? 
[Pension rules](
[Presentation rules](
[Accounting changes](
All of those and more are regulations that must be followed. You can't even begin to understand BV, current liabilities/assets, rev/exp, owners equity, or any other account if each company gets to decide and define how they are counting what when. How is this point lost on you?

Right so unless the federal government stepped in and unfucked the situation they would have been fucked. Maybe they should have known to buy the dip!!! 
This is shitty bitcoin talk, buying the dip works when you dont have skin in the game. Buying the dip doesn't necessarily work once you have skin in the game. 
Amazon is a growth stock. You do not invest in growth stocks for long term gains. That is a fools errand, and causes people to lose a ton of money. In fact if you reinvested dividends from a company like Exxon the compounding would put you far in front of Amazon even if you bought it for pennies. This is how most investors get tripped up. They are swinging for fences when the bases are loaded, and all they need to do is hit a safe ground ball to win. 
2 million is probably not enough to retire at 44. That only leaves you 50k a year (Hopefully his money is still not 'at risk'). That does not include the cost of cars, boats, trips to the caribbean (he is not retiring there he said he spends his time there). If I was his advisor I would be extremely worried. He risks running out of money during retirement, and medical bills are going to start creeping in. By the time he figures out he doesnt have enough to make it, he will be way to old to fix it.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:37:37
So heres the thing about a good bullshit story. Never give anyone who knows about these things enough ammo to blast your bullshit outta the sky. 
So you followed that rule invested for 26 years and have now retired at 44. Sounds good. So I will assume you have the bare minimum necessary to retire lets say 2 million (Not enough to spend all your time on boat in a caribbean but your living a fantasy so I will too, this would give you 50k a year from now til death to spend) . That means for those 26 years you have to have average annual returns of up to 7% from 1991-2017. 
 The unusal thing is that the biggest gains would have occured when you were just starting 1995,96,97 and the biggest losses when you were near the end 08. Everyone knows how compounding works and that situation above is what we call "OMG you got fucked in the ass". But let's assume you somehow managed to time two of the biggest market busts in 2000 and 2008 so you could average 7%, you still would need to invest 2,000 per month during those years. So where did you work at that at 18 that left you with 2000 in disposable income? 
Don't tell me real estate rents because even back in before 2005 banks were not stupid enough to give multiple mortgages to people without steady income? and real estate only starts paying off once the note is paid for.

Ah yes, thats why all those mega financial institutions got wiped out. tv brainwashed dimwits they were. 
You know how investing works right? You are aware how compounding works right? 
So a 38% return in 1996 means OP would have had ~106,000 in the account and the return of 38% that year means op ended the year at 146,280. However in 2008 OP would have had 1,396,240 in that account and that year when the market dipped 38% OP would have lost ~530,571. Big gains at the start, with big losses at the end is a recipe for disaster in an investment. 
Living in the Carribbean maybe cheap, but fucking boats capable of being lived on are not. Boats are motherfucking expensive!!! Don't believe me, than just literally ask anyone who has ever owned a boat.  Plus his expenses here would not stop. I'm assuming OP will still have a boat note and a mortgage or property taxes. So that 1500 is in addition to his regular living expenses. 
I see you didn't touch the main point of the arguement. That OP need to squirrel away in excess of 2,000 per MONTH to achieve those results for 26 years. Considering OP started investing at 18 I would like to know where he worked that he had 2,000 per month to hide away in investments!      
That only gets him 2 million. This is barely enough to retire on at 44, not enough to buy a boat and live a millionaire's lifestyle as claimed.  
Its a bullshit story, dont defend it. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:13:19
No that is destruction of property. 
Fraud is a false representation of a matter of fact—whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of what should have been disclosed—that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.
Break that down. 


They told you exactly what they were going to do, and did it. 


They did exactly what they said they were going to do. 
(3) its materiality; 
Materiality, if the correct facts were known would they have changed a reasonable persons mind. The correct facts were known so this doesn't apply. 
(4) the representer’s knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; 
Again they said exactly what they were doing, when they were doing, how much they were doing. Its true, not false 
(5) the representer’s intent that it should be acted upon by the person in the manner reasonably contemplated; 
Did they tell you, "you should sell/buy"? No. 
(6) the injured party’s ignorance of its falsity; 
The statement wasn't false, so you cant be ignorant
(7) the injured party’s reliance on its truth; 
The statement was true. If you relied on it than you placed reliance on a true fact, not a false one.  
(8) the injured party’s right to rely thereon; and 
again it was the truth
(9) the injured party’s consequent and proximate injury. 
And the crux of it. Were you injured. Did you sell? did you have to pay more? if not than you dont have a leg to stand on. 
Whether or not some other law was broken I can't say. BUT ITS NOT FRAUD!!!! not even close!

Yeah I mean this is basically what we do. It's no more a trick than a doctor prescribing antibiotics to treat a bacterial infection. I mean if I can take bonus depreciation, and a Sec 179 deduction why wouldn't I? That's not so much a trick as it is just knowing the tax code. I mean why own 79% of a company, only getting an 80% dividend received deduction when acquiring 1 more percent would allow for 100% dividend received deduction? Furthermore why are people shocked that accountants know how to do the job you pay them to do?

Just did payroll yesterday. 145k and it cost me a whopping 122.00. None of that was for 


Most of these fees are things like: Payroll tax remittance, workers comp logs, SUTA/FUTA compliance, child support payments, garnishments, unclaimed property issues. Let alone the fact that the software makes my job 10000 times easier. So simply cutting out the paper checks doesn't really save me a dime. 
There is a requirement that all employees have direct deposit, and do you know why? Not because we are a heartless dick, but because state unclaimed property audits are no fucking joke. That shithead that showed up to work for :45 min and gets a paycheck for .25c, yeah that's a liability on my books until that check clears. I have to make every reasonable attempt to get them the money, and if I can't I'm required to send his check to the state. However I can only do this at certain times and after certain events. Opps an employee lost a paycheck. Now I have to reissue a check, cancel the old one, make sure the old one doesn't clear. Deal with the documentation so that if the IRS shows up, it doesn't look like an under the table payment. I'm honestly surprised that any company still issues physical paychecks. Sure it sucks for those people that can't get or maintain a checking account, but honestly that's not on the employer.

Bitcoins are considered a capital asset, as such it must first be determined whether its short term or long term, then a few other factors should be considered. If long term (held for more than a year) the rates are between 0-20%, if short term it will be taxed at ordinary income .
