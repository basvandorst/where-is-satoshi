It's much easier to build such links based on real deposits instead of spam. There are hundreds of users receiving 0.00000001 BTC spam in a block, but if you sent 4.27994762 BTC into exchange then most likely you're the only one with this amount.

This is not leaking information and is not against best practices.
I've read dozens of threads in different places about people thinking that password reset feature disclosing wether particular email was or wasn't found in the database is a security threat. It's not.
Let's say you don't disclose wether the email was found. Guess what. I'll use signup form instead of password reset form. 99% of websites require unique emails and won't allow duplicate accounts with the same email. If someone tries to sign up, they need to disclose that he won't be able to register because account with this email already exists.
Now, I'm not sure if blockchain.info requires wallets to have unique emails (probably not), but as you were writing about good/bad practices in general, I just wanted to let you know that you're wrong.
Trying to make users'  life harder by using "We did or did not sent you a password reset email - check your inbox" or "Invalid email or password" after failed login makes really only legitimate users' life harder. Websites really should use messages like "Email not found" or "Invalid password" as login form errors and "Email not found" in password reset form errors. This is just good usability and makes users' life easier. If someone wants to check wether particular email has an account at a particular website, he will simply try to fill the registration form and check for "account with this email already exists" error.

If you want to use it only for cold storage, there's little point for this. It's great to use it as secure and active wallet which you use regularly. My favorite setup is:
- mobile wallet on my phone with small balance for everyday use,
- Trezor with higher balance for less frequent but larger transactions, for refilling mobile wallet and for all incoming transactions,
- paper cold wallet with dice-generated keys for higher balances which I don't intend to use for at least several months.

Because their fronted developer should stop doing what he knows how to do and instead start messing with securing hot wallet and redeploying backend infrastructure and databases?

My favorite setup is hot, warm and cold wallets.
- hot wallet with little balance on my smartphone for everyday spending - quick and convenient
- warm wallet with on my Trezor - for not so frequent larger transactions and for all incoming transactions
- cold wallet on a paper, preferably dice-generated - for coins which I know I'm not going to use for at least several months

Pantera is just a startup backed by Fortress Investment Group ($66B fund, please compare this to $10M invested into Bitstamp) and Benchmark Investments (not sure about size of their fund but they invested in 250+ startups). When someone asks about "big VC guys" he should think about guys behind Pantera, not Pantera itself. From their point of view, entire Pantera and all of Pantera investments is just a tiny portion of their portfolio, one of ~hundred invested companies which should go big or go home.

You can also generate a large number of private keys and send tiny amount of BTC between them all day long, every day, effectively spamming the network.
The simplest solution is to require that key revocation announcements always included a fee. If you need to pay a 0.0001 BTC fee for revoking a key, I'd say you will probably need a pretty good reason to revoke 100,000 keys.

VC business model is to invest in 100 companies and hit big on one or two of them, hit moderately well on another 8-10, break even on another 20 and see the last 70 companies go bust. For them it's just business as usual. They don't break a sweat.

SQL queries made by hand on a production database in a financial application are always risky. Most likely a withdrawal requires several queries which increases the risk. Doing it manually is usually asking for a disaster. You will do it correctly 1,000 times and then screw only once.
Not to mention that there are probably thousands of people wanting to withdraw fiat (including me). Their devs/sysops would do nothing else than manual withdrawals instead of working to bring the site back online.

It is production database in the sense that it's the current live database containing the most current data. It's unavailable to users at the moment, but it's still production copy. It will be used when the web application is restored. You can't mess with it.
You probably consider yourself a skilled dev and you probably are one. You can update live databases in your sleep, as most devs can. But perhaps you never worked in a proper development environment where processes are designed to make failure as unlikely as possible. In such environments you use your ninja skills elsewhere - somewhere where they cannot introduce any additional unnecessary risk.

I guess they have a database snapshot from point in time when they suspended their service and they are redeploying their entire infrastructure somewhere else. It would create inconsistencies if they proceed with any manual withdrawals and they would need to manually alter the database snapshots to reflect these withdrawals. Manually altering database is always too big risk and this is probably why they don't want to do this.

I believe this is only partially true. By avoiding accepting deposits and KYC/AML checks they basically outsource this process, along with all related risks, to their users. They only do the matchmaking and have their hands clean - it's the users who conduct transactions.
So you're an user and want to sell bitcoins for fiat. You send your bitcoins and you accept a money transfer from someone you don't know. Everything goes smoothly, you're happy with the service and you join all these people calling the exchange amazing. Then few months later you have FBI agents at your door because you accepted dirty money and essentially helped launder this money.
Thanks, but no thanks.

They would be able to fill 20 MB blocks with zero-fee transactions, true. But they wouldn't be able to push out of blocks other transactions including fee. Basically, their zero-fee transactions would at best fill up the block after all fee-included transactions were included - not much harm done here except of wasted storage space and bandwidth at full nodes. In order to disrupt confirmation times for fee-included transactions, they would need to include fee in their spam transactions as well, which makes it 20x more expensive.
