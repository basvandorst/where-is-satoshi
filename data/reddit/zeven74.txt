The difficulty adjusts automatically. The more mining power, the harder difficulty. Average will always stay at 10 minutes per block. No matter how much data power is thrown at mining.

In reality we will not, because of the automatic difficulty adjustment.
There is many reasons we should not reach Max cap to soon
- inflation
- miners incentives
Where miners incentives is the biggest issue.
At prices of 12 000 the miners is not incentivised enough from fee earnings. But at 3-5 million a coin it's different. Then block reward would not be needed.

BTC has the biggest Dev community with many of the best developers in the world. 
BTC has the biggest decentralized network in the world. 
BTC is closest of them all to solve the scalability issues, though the best solution, which is second layer. 
BTC is the most attacked and tried crypto  protocol and network in the world and therefore the most resilient if them all. 
BTC has the most secure blocks in the world. Yes, it uses a hell of a lot electricity to find the solution to each block. But that same electricity is needed to undo the blocks. 
I could go on and on. 
Bitcoins challenge is also it's strenght. The consensus rules makes it very very hard to change anything. But stability is very valued by the big money. 
To every one: a revolution of decentralized, censorship ressistant, boarderless, trust less, friction less, open, permission less, global, secure ,inclusiveness currency has been created. It will change the world and give freedom and possibilities unimaginable before 2009. 
Soon, not only the main Street Joe, but the wealthy and even states will hedge against the fiat death coming closer. 
All money is some one a debt. Increased debt is needed to get increased growth. We have come to a place where the world debt is so high that 24 Central Banks has 0-zero or negative interest, in order to be able to carry that debt. That situation with low or no interest is only increasing the debt in record speed. We have come to the end of the road of fractional reserve banking system. It was needed to bring the world to where it is today. But a big shift is happening. And thank God that the new solution arrived when it did, in 2009. 
Happy 2018. The year when the debt will create the biggest financial chrisis the world has seen.

I have more than 30

If that was true, Warren buffet and millions of investors, world wide, would invest 1 USD and spend the rest on fun.
Of course timing and amount matter!

If the thing got worth 1000$, the early adopter would then have 10 000$ (since he have 10 of them) and the late adopter would have 1000$, since he only have 1 of them. That's the difference.

I am honestly curious what your logic is. I ask to teach, not to troll. 
1. Would not the community find a solution and evolve the Bitcoin platform. Not now but in the future. 
2. Would not that solution also contain reply protection to avoid the same problem which crashed this fork 
3. Would not next version of Bitcoin platform create a split (at least at some probability )
The BT2 is not named B2X in Bitfinex. They did not remove it. People are buying it. Even this minute. 
To me, my logic says that there is an untapped uneblieavable opportunity. 
Yes, it's risk as well. But the logic above is to me logicall. 
Again. Please educate me if you have logics and info that makes my logic and statements wrong. 
I just think I see an opportunity most people has not seen yet. But which they will see pretty soon. And now prices is in the floor. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:51:21
Absolutely not. Bitcoin is very very cheap. Wait until its 250k and 1 million. Then you'll see that this is just the beginning.

If 70-75% hash power upgrade to 2 mb at the agreed block then a 51% attack on the 30% which does not run segwith21 would totally destroy the Bitcoin. Leaving segwit2 coin as the real Bitcoin. 
The next days will be extremely extremely exciting. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:26:22
You asked about what the difference is. It's huge.
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:59:10
Yes. I saw it after posting. But please see my other comments. 
What if segwit2 happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:47:00
The solution will come by hard work from the community. 
What do you think will happen to the botoin futures instrument BT2 in Bitfinex as soon as people starts think about solutions ? A solution would most probably have reply protection. The community will not go into the same trap again. This means that there will probably be a split. 
I just bought a lot of BT2 in Bitfinex at bottom low prices. I know I can lose it all. But the upside is extreme. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:57:52
No. My belief is that people should buy any time next 2 t years. Bitcoin will go to 10 000, then 25 000 then 50 000, then 100 000 etc. It will reach several million USD before flattening out and becoming a payment Currency. Until then it's a investment currency. 
This year it will probably end up close to 10 000, increasing 10 times value in 2017. In 2018 out will go a lot more mainstream and probably increase 12-15 times, from 10 000 to 150 000. 
My logic is that it's still early days for the value of bitcoin. But waiting to it reaches 15 000 in February is stupid, because you get twice as much today. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:52:02
 
Look at this. Also looking at coindance, 73,6% signals for Segwith2.x. 
As I understand the 80% consensus was for segwit. The upgrade to 2mb does not need that. 
Roger Ver...... Yes. Roger, supports segwit2 and Will not change the Bitcoin.com pool away from segwit2. 
It's definitely exciting times. I guess hash power could actually give a big big surprise.

You can do market order instead of limit order. Then it will execute instantly and give you the coin at market price. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:37:16
I could not agree more :-)
It's probably more chance to Win in lottery. I did not bet a lot. 0,316 BTC. I m ready to lose them. And probably will.
I see there is buyers in BT2. I think I am not alone in this crazy bet. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:31:59
He actually realised a press statement saying he will stay with the signed deal and mine segwit 2.x
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:19:05
Well. Why not buy now. Before it reaches 1 mill or 5 mill pr coin. You could even buy a fraction of a coin and get rich in 5 years. 
But no.  Too occupied with fear and doubt. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:15:30
You can. You can invest tomorrow or wait another week or another year, or never invest. It's fully up to you. 
Why this lack of logic in all your posts???????
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:58:16
You wrote "I am sorry for your loss" then you deleted it. 
Well, check out my loss....... I guess my lottery ticket was not that bad. At least not for now. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:14:17
New info : What if segwit2.x happens. We might get a lesson about hash power. The miners still signal 2.x. It was 6 people from dev community that aborted. The miners did not. For now. That micro chance is worth a fortune or can give me total loss.

Bullshit. Since 1913, this very same fractional reserve banking system, has lifted the world ecconomically extremely and lifted billions of people out of boredom. 
It's not helpful paying a cent per bottle of milk, if you earn a cent a day. 
Purchasing power has increased extremely since 1913.

Bitcoin is currency while neo and ETH is product/platform. I think we will see them stall at a later point due to release of a lot of smart contract platforms, while Bitcoin will become reserve currency in many countries Central Bank and the central currency amongst other currencies like Monero, LTC, Dash etc. 
As more competitors to eth and neo come; which is as great or greater, with regards to technology, there is no reason to run your smart contract in a platform where fuel is expensive, while there is platforms which might even be better where fuel is 5% of the price. 
Many people forget that eth is a platform for smart contacts and not a currency.
I don't think Bitcoin will get back to 100% market share as it had in January 2009. But I think it will get back to 70% as shit coins dies one by one and as we get many etherum/neo platforms which can do more than contacts around tokens. Decentralized Smart programs with ability to run entire decentralized companies using Oracle technology is light years from what eth platform can support. Think AirBNB or Uber as decentralized service, controlled by consensus with its own token. 
PS, eth does not need fall in price. It can even rise. But when Bitcoin reach 1 and later 5 million USD due to mainstream adoption and central Banks acquisitions and the fall of USD and fiat; the relative size difference will be huge .

Bitcoin will regain it's position when the alts is crashing one by one. 2000 ideas and products can't survive. Maybe 100 of them can.

This thread is great to "prove" that you lost your bitcoin. You can even probably use it with regards to tax authorities to "prove" to them that you dont have the bitcoins anymore and claim loss. It increase the credibibility off your "loss".
