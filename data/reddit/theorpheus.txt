SHX founder here.  I unfortunately can't comment publicly, but I don't see any harm in simply pulling a quote from this article:
"So, people did a bad thing, the SEC fined them, and they promised not to do it again. Which is a bit of a pity because there's been a recent Nobel prize awarded for insisting that such exchanges are just what we need."

Try iCracked -- the Uber for iPhone repair.  They send a technician to you in no time, and it's incredibly affordable.  I have a $10 coupon if you need it :)
