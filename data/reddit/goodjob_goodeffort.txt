Are you sure the price of WuCoin goes up to $5 based on a single coin purchase of $5?  Wouldn't the market immediately correct for this and find a price in the middle of $1 and $5?
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:24:49
Let me get this straight.  So you are saying that "fake bots" "paying fake dollars that everyone was pretending were real" and "once that fake demand disappears" etc etc... is basic economics? LMAO
Do you think every exchange is in on this tether conspiracy with the "fake bots"?  Do you think tether prints $100M batches of tether and sends them to exchanges without receiving anything in return from the exchanges?  You think there is no demand for cryptocurrency? 
You have no proof of anything you have said in your conspiracy theory rant.  But you know, "basic economics."  Oh basic economics!!?..I didnt think of that before!...now I get where you are coming from!!
GUYS ITS JUST BASIC ECONOMICS

Tether was bought with BTC, NOT USD.  Therefore it is the same as any other altcoin. THE VALUE OF TETHER IS PROPPED UP BY BTC, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.  If it went away tomorrow it would only be a larger economic event than the bitconnect collapse because noobs and weak hands would panic, NOT because it actually has any bearing on the overall market. It would be like tether never happened within weeks.

I hate to break it to you but bcash is just an altcoin with slighty less shitty tech than bitcoin(in current state).  It brings nothing new to the table.  If i want to save on fees im sure as hell not using bcash. I'd rather use something with almost no fee and instant like digibyte or pivx (and private). If we move away from bitcoin to something "better" it will not be bcash.

So basically your argument is based off the fallacy that the buy and sell orders on the books are "real" in the sense that they actually represent true buy orders and sell orders. Which obviously, is not the case.  And also, that everyone waiting to buy or sell have submitted orders.  Also, not even close to the case.

They provided statements signed by auditors in Sept and had $22 million more than they needed. They have been under investigation since early December, so it makes sense that the auditor cut ties to limit risk and also makes sense why they cannot release more information at this moment in time. 
You continue to provide absolutely zero proof of wrong doing. You like to state your opinion as fact. Saying "just magically getting billions of investment in a mere few weeks" is more conspiracy talk considering the entire market doubled in market cap in this time (obviously not an indication of actual $ invested, however the $ amount invested is certainly significant).  Of course there was more demand for tether. Why in the hell wouldnt there be?
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:54:23
Who says $20000 million?
Also, this does not prove only $10 Billion fiat has entered crypto.  Clearly it is not $600 billion but $10 billion? Come on now.

Thanks for the example. I for sure agree that ANY market is much larger than its actual deposits because all previously bought assets are priced at today's prices.  Tether is an extra variable so i can see the reason for concern.
If only 10 billion has entered crypto (i still find this number to be absurd but i guess possible?) then that means we are truly at the very beginning of this thing.  Imagine what $100 billion would/will do?  
How would we/ will we ever know if tether is actually backed 1 to 1 with usd?  Does it even matter?

This is a huge problem with bitcoin.  No one wants to wait 20 hours + if they don't put a large enough fee.  The average person would never use bitcoin as it is right now. 
 Why is blockchain allowing me to send money with a fee that will take it over 24 hours.  I have been using bitcoin for 3 years. Many many many transactions.  I have never had one "stuck" until now.  Ive always just used blockchain's automatic fee and it works.  I will learn my lesson and manually enter a higher fee next time.  However, my opinion of bitcoin has changed. This technology seems outdated already. Yeah the blockchain is revolutionary but bitcoin itself is still way too raw, not user friendly (for non tech people), unneccesary, hard to get, and other problems that limit its usefullness such as the blocksize/larger fee/transactions take forever problem.  Basically, this technology is a great idea with horrible implentation and some major flaws.  From a non tech savvy person, that uses bitcoin 3 or 4 times per week: there has to be a better way.  Transactions need to be almost instant. There will be no mainstream adoption and will remain propped up by speculation and the darknet.  Will they fix it? Can it be fixxed? Bitcoin is old in tech world. There has to be better technology in the crypto space.  I will be looking at alts for speculation. Bitcoin is not our savior. We need better technology than this to change the world.  Its a good start but not a finished product.   So annoyed, end rant/

No one I know even knows what bitcoin is.  Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will be the biggest financial revolution of our lifetime, imo.  The total crypto market cap is currently 145 billion. That is peanuts in the grand scheme of financial instruments.  Gold is an 8 trillion market cap, total stocks in the world are around 69 trillion mc. The derivatives market is estimated at 1.2 quadrillion. 
Once again, not many people have even heard of bitcoin yet.  You are in a bubble if you think everyone and their mother are buying this current dip (meanwhile btc still up 1k, 30%, on the month).  Crypto is not going to just crash and burn and go away. This technology is here to stay. Also, we've been hearing this bubble talk for years. You must be new here.

Fud.  Income tax is theft, it was originally created to fund wars.  These wars kill millions while redistributing wealth from the masses to the economic and political elite. 
Other forms of tax, however, are legal and necessary, imo.  
Also, we should tax the corporations, not the guy making 80k a year before taxes and struggling to take care of his family.  After federal income tax, state income tax, sales tax, and property tax that 80k annual income has the purchasing power of less than 50k.  Not to mention, the debasing of the currency year after year.  Wages either stay stagnant or do not grow at the rate of inflation. And we wonder why the middle class is shrinking so fast?

If employers paying in bitcoin became a common practice, bitcoin market cap would be in the 10s of trillions, if not much more. In no way does bitcoin's success depend on it becoming a form of wage payment.  When is the last time you heard of someone paying employees in gold?

Your points are garbage.  You think things are fine the way they are.  Corporate America runs this war machine of a country and you just say "well that's just the way it is." You are a coward at best. 
Also, in a free market, if corporations simply passed the tax costs to their employees and customers one would be inclined to think that these people would seek employment elsewhere and buy different products.  Your whole pathetic arguement hinges on this ridiculous assumption that people will not act in their best interest.  I also never suggested raising sales tax.  Only raise corporate income tax and do away with individual income tax.  Taxing individuals on their hard earned wage is modern day slavery. Gtfo of here man.

In 2015 federal tax revenue was $2.05 Trillion:  invidiual income tax = $1.48 trillion while corporate income tax = $342 Billion.  
Spending:  $600 billion on military, $73 billion on government, $26 billion on transportation

He was there earning his money while white people beg for it at 7eleven.  He could have warned him and told him why he was violating code and that he needed a permit instead of taking his hard earned money that he probably needed to support his family

I did respond. You just babble on about what you think would happen, but you state it as fact. 
Why am I paying a tax that I never agreed to, that has and continues to kill millions of innocent people? (20-30 million killed by us in 37 countries since ww2, wonder why we need protection/military spending/why the entire world hates us?) Why has my government decided they are the world police?

FUD because "make sure other people don't go about raping and pillaging everything, regulate companies to keep them from poisoning us or ripping us off."  Get real kid. 
Also, I am aware of the theory of trickle down economics.  It is bullshit. The rich do not get taxed more than the middle class. I never once said they get taxed more than the poor.  There are huge corporations paying less than 10% and as low as 0% tax making billions of dollars.  Meanwhile, struggling Americans are paying  more than twice their rate.  
“Last year my federal tax bill — the income tax I paid, as well as payroll taxes paid by me and on my behalf — was $6,938,744. That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4% of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33% to 41% and averaged 36%.” He added, “My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.”  - Warren Buffett

Increase corporate tax, decrease military and government spending.  These are general ideas, not concrete plans.

Like the movie, there were many Dread Pirate Roberts. He was not the creator of the site or the only person running it.  He is the only person doing life, tho.  Hence, fall guy.

There was never a single documented hit executed from this site.  These charges were dropped. These charges were simply a tactic used to deface Ross's name to the public and make him look like an actual criminal. Looks like you fell for it.  
Also, Ross was not the person who created Silk Road. He was simply one of the current administrators for the site. Just like in the movie, there were many Dread Pirate Roberts. He was 100% a fall guy, used to discourage future sites like Silk Road from being created. It didnt work.  There are many sites just like Silk Road and if they are shut down there will be new ones.
