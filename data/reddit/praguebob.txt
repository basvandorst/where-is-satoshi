The poster's point is that media DID report on such a swing, but on the down side! It's tongue in cheek, see?

Bill Gates doesn't need reddit to discredit him, he's done a perfectly good job of that himself over the past 30 years or so. If he had to pay for all the damage he's done to the planet he would have a negative net worth. If most people do respect him (which I doubt), it is only because they don't really know much about him, they should use this as a starting point, maybe it will open a few people's eyes to the truth

Yet another example of how the Chinese simply steal everything that isn't nailed down. It will jump up and bite them eventually. It's obvious that they're essentially "monkey see, monkey do" idiots, just look at how they boosted Apple's profit by buying iPhones. But somehow clever idiots. Dangerous, really. Only a fool would buy (or use) BWallet...

If Bill Gates HAD created bitcoin, he would just be abusing it for his own totally selfish and greedy purposes, but as far as I know he's never really created anything except misery for the rest of us, yes even his so-called "philanthropy" is a sham and disgrace (and has been for years, already)

That wasn't medium, it was tl;dr :-) And no, Ƀ just won't do!

That guy is the journalistic equivalent of a puppy mill and every bit as ethical. He cranks out mountains of this sort of nonsense on a wide range of topics that he obviously knows little or nothing about and the Washington Post just pushes it out to the sheeple.

The guy is well-known for sensational and inflammatory pseudo-journalism, with a long track record of rubbish. He's a self-serving and self-professed hack on the "after dinner circuit", not to be taken seriously. That's the naked truth about Jeffrey Robinson.

"Blockchains" without Bitcoin is nonsense, it just means more altcoins... :-)

My primary PC, and the one I am sending from, runs Ubuntu.

That's just a starting point, and it doesn't take much digging...

Yes, I very much agree... I predicted 500 USD as the bottom earlier today  but I did not see it go below 550 USD on Bitstamp before it started climbing steadily again... :-)
