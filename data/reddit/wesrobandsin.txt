This is assuming that past price has ANY indication of future price. Who cares about the average of the past 200 days? If you are making the (false) assumption that price is mean reverting, who says the true price isn't at $100 and we're just beginning the reversion? There are just too many studies that show TA is completely useless.

There are plenty of studies out there, but either way that's besides the point! It isn't my responsibility to prove you that you're wrong, it's yours to prove that you're right. 
200MA is a lagging indicator. To say that because price crossed over some average over the last X days that there is some sort of statistical edge, you're talking about voodoo here. WHY is that statistically significant? Why is the 200MA the holy Grail of moving averages? 
My point here isn't to discourage someone from exploring trading and pattern recognition, it's to stop people from being lazy and thinking that it's as easy as following a moving average. TA may be profitable over certain periods, but over time it is a zero sum game. Factor in fees and spreads and you're always going to lose. If it were that easy to win then everyone would be rich!

I think you're capable of using Google

Dude, just go to Google scholar and search for it yourself. If you're this lazy about researching technical analysis then you're fucked as a trader

All indicators are lagging? How about price action? Volume? Order flow? 
Just stop.

If drawing lines on a chart helps you sleep at night then so be it. Past price action is not indicative of future movement. Markets are random by nature.  You'd have better results choosing a direction with a coin flip.
I was an FX trader in Chicago for two years and have traded the markets for a long time. If these indicators were profitable, everyone would be doing it! I'm no expert by any means, but don't be ignorant :)

These are all lagging indicators and mean nothing

As I mentioned before, these are lagging indicators. The"data" you are seeing does not represent price action that is happening in the present, but rather past price action. While certain statistical hypotheses might be useful in predicting stochastic processes such as market movement, they are a bit more complex than a simple moving average, and they are certainly never lagging indicators.
How naive are you to think that people haven't attempted to trade on these indicators before? Do you really think making money in markets is that easy?
I'm just trying to stop you from making impulsive investment decisions based on this "data." It might be more worth your time to research the technology behind these currencies rather than predicting movement based on lazy technical analysis.
