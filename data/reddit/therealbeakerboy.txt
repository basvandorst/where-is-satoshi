So mathematicians have proven that a quantum computer can't reverse the SHA256 hash function given constraints on the format of the function's input?
In my mind (who knows little to nothing on quantum computing) I would imagine a series of qbits representing the input key, and the quantum computer "testing all possibilities simultaneously" to find the pattern of bits which would give the hash. Then this could be fed to another quantum program to get the private key.

Since the table lists the difficulty where he string is "1Ninja" and I'm ok with "Ninja" being in any one of 29 positions, I'd think the overall odds would be about published_value/29.
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:04:31
Then I need to find a quantum computing ELI5 because I thought it was basically parallel comparing your input where the bits were both one and zero to traverse all paths at the same time...think traveling salesman walking all paths at onece to find the shortest.
@_date: 2015-12-07 17:09:17
When I run the vanitygen.exe I get 1/3 the keys/sec when doing a regular expression comparison versus just a straight "1Ninja" generation. I'm curious why that is.
Either way, a private key with "Beakerboy" it it is well beyond my means, unless I want this to run for a few years.

This is confusing, because a user above said that funds are paid to the hash of an address, so wouldn't anyone with an address which shares the hash be able to redeem the funds?

Seems very scientific.

Dwarf fortress is a game I’ve always wanted to play, but between my wife, kids, work, kids hobbies and general chores, i’ve never found the time beyond watching a couple “how to play” videos and generating a world. I’ve played nethack since the 90’s so I’m sure I’d love the complexity...I actually subscribe to that sub just to keep me interested.

You should fork the BU code to your own repository on github, add comments where you feel they would be necessary, and submit some pull requests. You can help others in your position and contribute to peer review.

This sounds like centralization. I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized.

I didn't think we discussed altcoins on this sub....take your propaganda elsewhere!

instead of assuming "slandering and propaganda" why not assume good faith. My guess is both sides in these bitcoin debates truly believe what they are doing is for the best of capital "B" Bitcoin. 
Maybe core is playing loose on source management..If so, wouldn't it be nice that someone is looking it it from a different perspective? if no, additional scrutiny can't hurt.

Ever heard of "prize linked savings"? It's a cool concept where you put money in a no-interest savings account. Every month, all the interest for all the money in everyone's accounts is awarded to one person. It's like the lottery, but you don't really "loose". You can withdraw your savings at any time.

It would be more helpful to your argument if you backed up
your statements with some evidence. If "you can see the hashrate moving" provide a 3rd party source clearly showing this. So far, both charts on this thread do not support your claims.

You are absolutely correct...mixed up median and mean in the late night haze. The median is about 7 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:27:58
This is my position as well, so thanks. The other user was concerned with your usage of the word 'arbitrary'. I assume you mean 'random', but I guess it could also mean 'specific, but unimportant'.
To be fair though...even if you did transmit your transaction '5 minutes after the last block' you would still have a 10 minute average wait.

I DID read it. it was kind of boring and slightly technical. He mentions a few things he would do differently if he were a core programmer and how he implements those differences on his project. Slander is a "false and damaging statement". I don't see anything damaging in his post. I don't know enough about the level of unit testing that core uses to know if what he said is false. If he said "there is no code quality done, so you will all lose your coins if you use core" I would say he was slandering. It reads like a difference in code philosophy to me (speaking as someone who regularly does absolutely NO unit testing...or any other testing for that matter on their code ;-) )

If you think about it, he's kind of right. The 21 million number is nowhere in the code. There are several other fundamental constants that, when taken together, lead to the 21 million figure. In order to change the supply one would have to change the fundamental halving period and the splitting percent ( half, third, whatever). Changing these would change the final total number of coins. It would be like saying that Planck's constant wasn't a central property of physics, which is true, because it's calculated from other fundamental constants. This has nothing to do with its importance.

Let's say you have some bitcoin, and there is a fork. you now have coins at the same address on both chains. Now you decide to buy something with some of your pre-fork coins. If replay protection did not exist, if you transfer those coins, anyone could copy your transaction and "replay" it to the other chain and it would go through. So either the person you sent them to could effectively steal your coins from the other chain, or a malicious actor could just cause mayhem by replaying transactions to cause loss of funds.

It’s philosophy, not morality. There is no good nor evil, just different ideas on how money is supposed to operate. An investment can either be held onto and looked at, with no utility (like a beanie baby), or used.

I gues one of the problems with competitive mining is the fact that the chain will fork. It would be nice if these forks could be less contentious.

You don’t know a thing about me. Why do you think I’m a gullible moron?  I don’t presume to know anything about you. To be honest, I’ve made a fair bit of money on BTC and nothing on BCH. That doesn’t stop me from stepping back from the emotions and having a discussion on the technical aspects and cryptocurrencies. Once you mix emotions and investing you have a bad combination.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:56:12
��‍♂️ His statements are all internally consistent. I personally have seen no behavior that indicates he’s a scammer. He has a personal philosophy that differs from yours and is promoting that view.

That's a good point. If the roads can't handle the traffic, the options are, what, sometimes a bus will fill up with people, but be orphaned on the side of the road once in a while. With more busses, they'll be able to hop on another bigger bus pretty quickly. Some engineering economic calculations would be able to point if the cost of bus breakdowns is more or less than the increased income due to additional passengers using the system.

I wonder if there are any other business models where this is he best economic decision...raising price instead of increasing production. Luxury goods, like Birkin Bags are the only one I can think of. Is this where bitcoin is going? A pay-to-play good for the elite conspicuous consumer?
@_date: 2016-10-26 11:53:52
Good one...and I just bought a high clarity lab-grown diamond for this very reason...great price! I wonder what the bitcoin equivalent of a lab-grown diamond is...something which is exactly the same, but more friendly on the consumer.

In order to “consolidate it” they would have to create a transaction. Each unspent output would need to be used as a separate input in the transaction, which would create a very large transaction in bytes. Since fees are calculated as Satoshis per byte, larger transactions pay larger fees. If fees are too high to just send the dust, it will be too high to consolidate several dust addresses. There was a period of time on another bitcoin chain, where the average transaction size went through the roof. My understanding is this was due to low fees allowing people or exchanges to consolidate.
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:02:11
Thanks.  says that it would be split between short and long term.
@_date: 2016-10-26 02:10:36
....and if everyone does that there will STILL be a backlog. That's like charging more to get on the bus, when adding another bus to the route is the better way to get everyone to their destination on time.

because nothing helps a cause quite like memes. Imagine if the sufferage movement had memes...or the civil rights movement. Those would have been glorious times!

Or someone can build a private side-road and make all the busses drive there instead of the main road.

I do. I have a modest amount of my small business 'savings' in BTC. I've pulled some out to make capital purchases and report all gains and loses. All in all I'm much better than any sort of savings account.

You have to choose whether you want to do FIFO or LIFO, First In First Out, or Last In First Out. The advantage of LIFO, is it allows your earlier coins to stick around longer and have a better chance of reaching over one-year-old. After one year they are taxed as long term capital gains instead of short-term capital gains
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:08:25
Think about it like getting paid to eat pizza that you buy. You buy .1 pizzas one week, the .08 pizzas the next. The following week you decide to eat .09 pizza. If your procedure is LIFO, then you will have eaten all of the second transaction and 10%(.01) of the first. If you do FIFO, you would eat .09, nearly all of the first pizza. You keep buying and eating and keeping track of all the crumbs. That is US Bitcoin tax law currently.
@_date: 2016-07-20 00:52:30
That's exactly what makes the law so bad, but you're right, it makes things complicated. Does anyone know how currency trading is managed as compared to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:47:15
Look at my pizza analogy below. It might help imagine how 'asset matching' works.
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:14:53
I think (never looked it up specifically because I only trade BTC) trades between cryptos is handled the same way. You have to know a market price for the asset when you trade it, and track any gains when it moves.
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:12:07
Investments that have been held longer than a year (long term capital gains) are taxed at a lower rate(15%) compared to the nearly 50% in the highest bracket. This is part of the tax debate in the US. If you are rich, most of your income does not come from salary, but from long-term investments. That means your effective tax-rate is lower than a middle-class working family who pays 25% tax.
