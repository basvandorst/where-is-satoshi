Bitcoin is disgustingly manipulated. I sold, have been debating on buying back in but when you see how obvious pumps and dumps are it's sickening.

You forgot the /s?

13 cents is an acceptable fee?

If you’re not buying BSV (real Bitcoin) you fucked up.

Why is this community moon boy drones that get hard when they see a price rise? Focus on adoption not manipulation.

Whats the avg fee?

BCH is acceptable as well.

So it’s basically a backup currency? By what you explained it doesn’t seem like it will ever get major real world use.

Never knew a valid question was trolling. Cope harder.

if bitcoin wishes to become a global currency, or THE global currency, how can you expect it to get any traction if no one wants to spend it in speculation it could go higher? That's downright stupid.

HODL is not a tip. It’s detrimental to the idea of peer to peer cash. Treating it as gold is not what satoshi intended

Why does bitcoin need a second layer solution? Genuinely curious. At that point it doesn't seem like bitcoin is working as intended.

Do you think the direction bitcoin developers took after Satoshi could be a contributing factor in it getting clogged up?
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:29:06
Cash is meant to be spent on things you need and saved to eventually spend on bigger expenses. The bitcoin community is treating bitcoin like gold bars and it's sickening and an affront to what Satoshi intended.

What would be the best case scenario for Bitcoin?

Nah shill post
