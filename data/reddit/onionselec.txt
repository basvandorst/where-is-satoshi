8 chars 4 min's each? 9 char's about 2 hours maybe 4. 10 i dunno but id guess 3-4 days. Id only do 10 if willing to pay ;) hahaha
2133MH/s :)
If you want i could generate some for you, i was reading about a way you can do it without me knowing the private key. Ill try to find how to do it if your interested?

Hi, I followed the normal guide first and then configured it as a hidden service one i knew it was working :)  
Currently generating some vanity .onion address' I think ill change it to something a bit more memable. Have these available so far:  
electrum2viavtqw.onion  
electrumm4qddpf2.onion  
electrumaay7a3lc.onion  
Kinda wondering what people thing is the easiest?

Hash: SHA256
NOT CONNECTING ISSUE:
Please note because i changed the main DOMAIN i also changed the SSL cert to match. People trying to connect to the .onion and .noip.me might not be able to connect because electrum CACHES certificates of servers and mine has changed! You will need to remove the cached cert for both .noip.me and .onion. You can find these in 
On windows;
I am unsure, if you know please let me know so i can update it!
Once this is done you should be able to connect again!
On FRIDAY the 5th of Febuary 2016 i will be moving FROM a noip address. 
The new address is electrum.dancrypto.com this is usable now! (and should also show on the list of servers)
However as from friday it will be that address that shows up in the electrum server list rather than electrumserv.noip.me. 
.onion remains unaffected!
