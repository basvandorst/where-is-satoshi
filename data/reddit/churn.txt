I need to think about this for a while.  Broadcasting announcements from potentially millions of nodes doesn’t sound scalable.  Add to that the part where each node’s payment channel is changing as payments traverse them.  There is too much new and changing information that needs to be dispersed to every node on a continuous basis...
I will think on this tomorrow and read into the link you provided.  There’s probably some answers in there.

This is useful, thanks!  I'll search out the presentation.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:47:37
I don’t see how it discovers the nodes in the first place.  Sure, once all the nodes are known, this could traverse them looking for a path between nodes.  But how are the nodes addressed or referenced before they are known.  There must be some sort of discovery or a method for nodes to register their address on the Lightning Network.  Do you happen to have any guess at how that is done?
Either way thanks for this!

Tor - the onion router, is misleading in this context though.  Without the BGP routing protocol on the Internet learning routes between all nodes, the TOR nodes could not find even the first node in its path.  TOR encapsulates its encrypted payload and sends it out onto the internet using existing Internet routes to find its way.
Lightning needs more than just TOR to work.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:43:45
Thanks.  If I start up a LN node right now, how does it find the other nodes and payment channels?  Is there a directory of Payment Channel addresses someplace that my node can query to find the address of the person I want to send coins to?

@_date: 2018-01-19 19:57:12
30 cents plus 2.40 = 2.70 total.
Divided by the 10 transactions, you spent 27 cents in fees per transaction while other cryptos that have only existed for a few months are accomplishing the same thing for less than 1 cent per transaction.
No, I didn't miss the part where you did 10 more transactions, but I think you've missed what's been happening in cryptos during the past 6 months.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:52:07

But what about the taxes on each of those sell transactions?  have you considered this?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:45:07
Everyone is telling you **what it is**
**the point of it** is that you can use it as a safe harbor when you think the market is tanking...like today.
Trade all your cryptos into USDT (Tether) and wait.  Once the market bottoms, you trade back in getting your coins at a discount.
Because, while all the cryptos are crashing.  1 USDT is still worth 1 usd.

Hello again, yes you were at least polite and trying to help.  :)  
Here is what I found from May 2016 actually 
I still do not know... might be the Landmark Routing that Bitfury developed.
This too is pretty old.  Even if it is what will eventually be used, I’d like to know what is being used today on the main-net.
It would be interesting to me while I watch the number of nodes increase, what routing method is used as it will impact the speed that the nodes are brought online and then will have to scale without degrading performance.

Your point is true, but they are like a bank in that the hub nodes will be charging me a fee to use my own money.  So I will be paying a middle man.  This is not "peer to peer".  I'm not sure I'm liking where this is going.

Hard to say what’s causing that, it could be the number of objects the physics engine has to manage, or if recksplorer has to perform path discovery in real-time it could be that as well.  But it doesn’t have to find a specific path while evaluating it against all others like path discovery will.  Since it is mapping the whole network it can use the traveling salesmen methods where a path that touches each node is used.  It doesn’t care what capacity each channel has and doesn’t have to measure one against the other.
I would lean towards the physics engine being the culprit there.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:22:16
At this time, BTC is performing better than the last couple of months.  The mem pool emptied allowing cheaper, faster transactions.  It shouldn't be necessary to convert BTC to something else if they wanted to transfer it out of their exchange.

20 hops, just like TOR, sure.  But TOR depends on the internet knowing the routes between nodes.  How does LN accomplish this?

What is their incentive to maintain uptime for my transactions?  
If they charge a fee, will each hop across the LN also charge me a fee?

I’m starting to realize that this is not the place to ask for details on the current implementation of Lightning Network.  I tried asking what payment path protocol it uses and got one person who gave me outdated information from 2016 by telling me it is using Dyjkstra and had me waste time searching for information on this implementation only to find that Rusty Russel ruled that algorithm out back in July 2016.  
The second person who responded to me was just hostile.  Questioned why I would want to know and wanted to quiz my knowledge of routing protocols before he would offer any guidance on how it works.  Basically saying it’s too complicated for average people to understand without specialized educations on network routing.  I happen to be a Network Engineer, he was zero help.  When I told him the other person suggested I google Dyjkstra and Lightning he just laughed and said if I think that’s how it works then I’m clueless...
I’m wondering what the hell?!  I’m just asking what the payment path finding method is called so I can look up more information on how it solves what I think is a difficult problem.
Still would like to know if anyone reading this is willing to share the name of the protocol.

I hear you.  Full disclosure I hold several cryptocurrencies besides BTC, including BCH...but I'm not a "bcash troll".  I'm here looking for information that will guide my investment decisions.  
I don't see what's so hard about answering truthfully...if you know...answer.  If you don't...don't answer at all.
Too frequently the answer to questions about Lightning Network is a question rather than any sort of answer and that question is like an interrogation.  "How much do you know about lightning protocol?  If you don't know already I can't begin to have a discussion with you or answer your question."
This type of answer sounds like complete BS.  And even if the person asking won't understand the answer, many people read over these questions and answers and I'm sure there will be someone right at the point where they are looking for that specific explanation or perhaps you explain it in a way that really clicks with someone else...and maybe they jump in with a follow up question that is on point...and now you are having true discourse with someone other than the person who originally asked their "dumb?" question.

I knew them all, and the explanation for number 4 is wrong.  How many transactions your bitcoins were part of in the past have no bearing on the cost of your new transactions.  The size of your transaction is determined by inputs and outputs of the current transaction not past transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:15:08
No.  There is already more transactions in the mempool than will fit in a 1 MB block.  The miner can select from the mempool using any criteria they like.   Once a miner solves the next block, it’s 1MB block gets sent out to all the other miners.  If someone sent an extra 200MB of transactions it would not affect this process.

Bob has no Bitcoin but asks how it works so I would say...
“Hey bob, download this free app.  Buy some bitcoin, open a channel and then I will show you how easy it is...”
“Bob!  Why are you complaining about not having bitcoin already?  I’m trying to show you how easy this is.  Just buy some bitcoin, open a channel with it and I will send you your first bitcoin free!”

It's best not to tell anyone.  
If you must disclose it to anyone, to explain a large purchase, for example, then make it seem that you've almost completely wiped out all you had.  Say you make a purchase for 1,000.00 then maybe admit to having 2,000.00 worth of bitcoin.
or if you are buying your first car, share only that you have a little over the amount necessary to buy the car.  This way, you don't appear to have much money for people to come begging for.  While at the same time, in the future you'll be able to say that little bit that remained grew to be enough for the next purchase, etc.

Bitcoin gets updated by soft forks and hard forks.  The only plan by the devs to fix the scaling issue will be to implement a second layer protocol on top of the block chain called Lightning Network.  Do some research on this.
Nothing you described has anything to do with block chain development.

I don't think Jimmy understands the definition of fiat he used...
1. a command or act of will that creates something without or as if without further effort
2. an authoritative determination
3. an authoritative or arbitrary order
In regards to money, fiat using the above definitions means the government commands that its citizens use the money it created by decree.  Emphasis should be on the word 'use'.
Simply creating something by authoritative determination or order does not make it fiat.  Those orders must also force you to use the fiat money.
By Jimmy's interpretation, Microsoft Office is fiat.  Microsoft controls it, creates it by copying  it over and over again as many times as they like and selling it.  The thing that's missing is that Microsoft can not demand that people use MS Office in the way that governments demand you pay taxes using their fiat currency.
Likewise, no one can demand that you use bitcoin or any other crypto, so none of them are fiat.
Edit - to be clear the definitions are for the word 'fiat' not 'fiat money'.

Exactly this. CEO of Twitter ( Jack Dorsey) spoke to the U.S. Congress this week about bias and manipulation on Twitter.  All anyone seems to care about is voters being swayed to vote one way or the other in an election.   Some say their algorithms are too aggressively blocking and banning conservative tweets.
But nobody bats an eye at blatant scams stealing from people right in the open for the whole world to see.

I hope I can ask you a quick question I've been wondering about.  Is the bandwidth really related to block size?  
I mean, the mempool is increasing in size and is being broadcast to all the miners, right?  The block that gets mined is just a fraction of that, isn't it?  What am I missing here?
Thanks in advance or anyone else than can shed light on this.

Not like you would want.  For the coins at those old addresses to remain there, the person selling to you would have to hand over the private key.  This means they also have the private key to your new asset, not good.  To protect you, they would need to send them to a public address for which you have the only private key.  But then those coins are at a new address instead of their original address.

You are correct,,, here is what I was remembering 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:56:54
This idea is a Gold Mine, literally...  
Create a mobile app similar to Clash of Clans.  
When you start out building your village, one of the first things you do is build a gold mine to slowly generate funds to buy guard towers, upgrade troops, build walls etc..  
In this game, your mobile device will actually be mining a real crypto currency (e.g. Monero).  A tiny bit of the mined Monero goes back to the game developer (you), and the rest goes into the players coffers.  
The player can use the Monero to upgrade items and advance to the next level.  One thing they should be able to upgrade is the gold mine so that they start getting a larger percentage of the Monero mined.  
You'd need to also allow them to cash out if they want to, so taking in-game Monero they generated out of the game and into their own Monero Wallet should be an option.  However, to ensure that all players enable and upgrade their Monero Mines inside the game, you should not allow Monero from outside of the game be imported.  
Then the rest of the game is just like similar games where they try to attack other villiages.  If they successfully attack someone's village they are rewarded with a little of that players Monero.  
Each player needs to be sure to build up their own defenses by spending Monero on them, because their village can be attacked too!

When Gates, Dimon, Buffet, and Munger speak of Bitcoin, they are not speaking to people who know more about Bitcoin than they do.  They are specifically speaking to people who know little and just need the tiniest nudge to remain fearful of Bitcoin.  
It is no accident that these extremely intelligent men with perhaps the most cumulative knowledge of finance and money are all speaking negatively of Bitcoin suddenly when it has captured the attention of the masses.  
They are afraid of it.  Not for what it will do to the unsuspecting but because of what it will do to their own interests.  Their aim is to either stop it or slow it down as much as possible.  Just like the music industry tried to stop or slow down streaming music.  They were so happy forcing everyone to buy CDs.  
Today the movie and TV industries are being disrupted by streaming content.  Cable and satellite companies are being cut out of their role in delivering content.  
So to are the banks and financial industries as everything is digitized and streamed from anyone to anyone across the globe.  
Everything is being disrupted.  The old guard sees it, they feel it in their balance sheets, and they can not stop it!

Bit of a misconception there.  The lightning network today uses the gossip protocol to broadcast channel states to every single Lightning node on the network.  The routing problem has not yet been solved.  
This means the Lightning Network is no different than the Ethernet hubs you described in your article.  
Before you say they will solve it soon, remember this is not a new problem.  They have been working on it for over two years and finally decided to release Lightning Network using a broadcast protocol.  Next they will scrap any intention to solve the routing problem and will resort to using centralized hubs.  This means the Lightning Network will never route payments in the way you have described here.  
Don’t take my word for it, pin down a dev and ask them how they intend to solve the routing problem.  Ask rusty Russell.  He’s the main dev working on this, has been for over two years.

You need to keep your own accurate records of the dates and prices you bought BTC.  Then track the dates and pieces you sold it.  The portion that is profit (i.e. Above what you paid when you bought) is taxable income.  If you bought and sold within a year, you held it for a short term and have to pay short term capital gains tax on those profits which is 30%.  If you held for over a year before selling then you owe long term capital gains tax which is only 15%.
Even the IRS wants you to HODL, or be taxed more.

Eh, it's an okay video on a topic we are all interested in, but there are too many biblical comparisons.  Dealing with gods and deities is a zero sum game, you win it all while the other side loses everything.  However in our world and especially in investing there are many degrees of winning and there is room for many different variations of things.  For example, instead of bitcoin evolving to replace all coins in a survival of the fittest type of fight.   There are many niches where other coins can flourish.  Like bitcoin is a store of value like gold.  Ethereum is smart money that can contractually bind adherents to agreements for profitable ends. 
There doesn't have to be losers for there to be winners.
I do like your view on forks giving investors the power to choose though.  There must be a better way to express it though than for all forks to be a fight to the death.

In some ways this is a good sign for bitcoin.  I heard a story once that I am probably going to butcher in this attempt to retell it.
It was World War II and there was a crew on a bomber that kept making successful bombing raids on Berlin.  When asked how they knew they were over their target and not dropping bombs on empty fields and the like the pilot spoke up.  He said, "When we are over our target, that is when we take the most flak (anti aircraft fire) from the enemy.  So the more they try to shoot us down, the more encouraging it is that we are right on target."
So the more Bitcoin is attacked by governments and old world financial institutions, the more encouraging it is to me that bitcoin is right on target for changing the world.

Take the BTC.  When that initial 800 is worth 1000, do not sell it.  When it is worth 5000, 10000, or 15000, do not sell it.
Bitcoin has been doubling in value every 8 months and continues to do so.

I will probably feel the same way about 5K after we blow past that and hit 6K all at once before next week.
We have reached a point where big money is moving into bitcoin and they want to get it as cheap as possible, but they are underestimating the bitcoin community that was here long before them.  It won't be as easy as Goldman Sachs thinks to scare everyone into a sustainable panic sell.

Same as what happens today.  Supply and demand.   The supply side is not affected much by mining, when you go to buy a bitcoin you pay the price of the person willing to sell at the lowest price.  Mining is not really a factor.

Yeah, but I think it's because the price was depressed by the specter of a hard fork.  Now that the uncertainty has been removed, BTC is simply returning to where it would have been if it had continued from the May highs, without the fear of a hard fork.

I think that what we are seeing this weekend is the start of a new wave of people getting into bitcoin.  This is merely the tip of the iceberg.  If I'm right, there will be such a groundswell of new people buying in that it will hit 4500 in days, 5000 in September and 6500 to 7000 by years end.

I would buy equal usd amounts of each, but not all at once.  Pick a day of the week and buy a little of whichever one is down the most that day.

Historically, every single time there is a price rise, it keeps going until it reaches a peak which it does not go above.  Once this peak is reached, the price will start retracing back down to lower levels until it reaches a level where buyers provide enough support to stop the decline.  At this point the price begins to rise again.
Every.  Single.  Time.
Hope this helped.
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:46:10
Ask yourself two questions... "Did you buy yesterday because you thought it was going down?"    "Do you now think it is going down?"
If the answer to those is "no" then keep buying and keep holding what you buy.
There are many many stories of people who bought, it went dow, but then eventually it went way way up and made them rich because they simply held onto it and never sold.
Never use money you will need, so that you never have to sell.

Yes, exactly that there are orders waiting to buy at 3400.  Those orders will have to be filled (or withdrawn) before bitcoin can sell lower.
The opposite of support is resistance.  When there are a large number of sell orders at a higher price, they must be filled before bitcoin can go higher than that "resistance level."

No no no... these are not sell signals.  Sell signals would be when everyone that wants bitcoin is already in it.  These signals are indicating that bitcoin is legitimate and this is a driver for more demand.
When the Apple iPhone was first announced everyone had either flip phones or Blackberries and the initial mainstream story was that apple is a computer company and they can't possibly expect to compete with legitimate cell phone makers.  Eventually the story changed and everyone saw the utility of owning an iPhone so the media reports turned positive...would you have sold apple then?  In 2008 or 2009?  It wasn't until much later that Apples share price stalled and that was when everyone who wanted an iPhone already had one, so the new subscriber numbers were no longer increasing at heady rates.
That is where we are with bitcoin, right on the cusp of worldwide adoption.  This is a major buy signal!!
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:04:10
Over the long term it has been every 8 months.  Recently it has been shorter than 8 months but a drop in price can always put us back on the 8 month doubling rate.  Personally I'd love the doubling rate to increase and be sustained, but I'm ok with every 8 months.

The answer is either "yes, unfortunately" or "no, and that's awesome!"
I say this because bitcoins value will need to increase slower for you to catch it.  If it increases slower. The fixed amount you keep putting in will be worth less.  If you can't catch up and acquire a single bitcoin, that's actually best for you as it will mean what you have is worth more than it would have been, otherwise.

I'm far from an expert, so I will be watching for more informed replies.  That said, I think the issue is that of conversion.

Before the recent fork, bitcoin price was held down by uncertainty.  Now that has been removed so bitcoin went back to all time highs.  All time highs got it some positive news coverage.  Positive news coverage brought in more buyers, which drove the price even higher, which is generating even more positive coverage and more public awareness.

This is a good question.  
My guess would be yes, the store can refund to OP.  OP opened a channel directly with the store.  I suspect it was a one-way channel with funds only on OP's side of the channel.  Once OP paid them, the store would have a balance on their end of the channel that they could send back to OP if they chose to.  
Even if I am incorrect about the above, OP could give the store his LN URI code that the store could use to open a channel directly with him to send the funds back to him.  
None of this should be difficult because there is no payment path finding (routing) involved.  It is directly between two LN nodes who have an open channel between them.  It would be more interesting if OP had opened a channel with a different LN node than the store he was about to transact with.  
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:22:38
From what I've gathered, probably not 100% accurate, but it's a start towards understanding things, at least...
1st there was Bitcoin.   It attracted the best programmers in the world.  
These programmers shared their code with everyone before implementation and vetted out bad code and bad ideas from each other.  
Some coders are not so good and get their ideas/code rejected by what has become known as the core devs.
A successful investor/business man comes along and starts helping with the Bitcoin brand, etc...   Seeing the difficulty involved with making changes to the bitcoin system, he promoted a more centralized approach including a board that would decide on changes, etc.  
This suggestion went against the de-centralized nature of Bitcoin and was also rejected by the bitcoin core devs.
The investor starts getting traction with the rejected devs and they start promoting their own ideas which the core devs continue to reject.  The investor and his team even suggest firing the Core Devs at one point.  All of this goes on for years with nothing getting accomplished.
Finally, the investor and his rejected devs decide to create a hard fork in the Bitcoin Blockchain and call it Bitcoin Cash.  This will allow them to implement the changes they always wanted but that were rejected by the Bitcoin Core Devs.
And today is the day...Today the nodes supporting Bitcoin Cash have split from Bitcoin and at this very moment are attempting to mine their first block.  Once they do, there will be two Bitcoins, BTC and BTH.
The market will decide which has more value and if either, both, or neither will survive long term.

Nah man, it's a great analogy, here's why.  
Weather analysis takes in many different metrics, nearly anything that can affect the weather in a location.  Even then you only get a "Percent chance" of rain or sunshine, etc... because even with all the inputs covered it's still not 100% accurate.  There can be news, political upheaval, new regulations and weather doesn't care, it does what it does.  So in theory you can eventually get a weather model that is 100% accurate assuming you have the computing power to process all the inputs before the event.  
Technical Analysis does the same thing.  It takes in many different metrics, nearly any pattern that can be tracked and compared to the historical data to determine what's likely to happen next.  But!  Unlike the weather, markets do care about news, political upheaval, new regulations, etc... so you can never have 100% accurate TA like you can theoretically with weather models.  Because even if you 100% accurate TA that can tell you exactly what's going to happen tomorrow with the price, your TA can't do shit about a major government suddenly announcing some news, good or bad, that takes the market completely away from your perfect TA.  
In conclusion, weather modeling beats TA everytime.  And weather modeling can only give you a percent chance of being correct.

I understand.  My question stems from hearing someone say Auditors don't understand crypto so they can not effectively audit crypto assets.  For example, we show on the books where USD came in and USDT was created.  USDT flows out and USD is transferred out of the bank.  
So far so good.  That's all on the company books, easy to see.  Now the auditor needs to see the bank statements to verify the USD balances in the business accounts match whats on the books both in balance and in activity.  
Still no problem.  Last part though is where the auditor needs to verify the existence of the crypto assets.  Now they have a problem.  How will they know if the crypto at any particular address actually belongs to the company?  How do they know that the crypto that was burned permanently when exchanged back into USD was really burned?  
See the problem?

Weather reports are very accurate these days, but they didn’t used to be.  
The way they predict the weather is to consider many different variables and then say that 68% of the time we saw these exact conditions it rained.  So you have a 68% chance of rain.  
I think technical analysis is the same.  The best they can give you is “we have seen this pattern before and 85% of the time it goes up from here.”

This is just my opinion, I don't think you can convince people something is not in a bubble by having the price go even higher.  Seems like they'd be more likely to think it's a bubble in this case.  
To change people's minds about Bitcoin's price being a bubble, there needs to be wide spread adoption where people see it being used in every day life.  People getting their salaries paid in bitcoin, the IRS accepting bitcoin as payment, corner stores and big retailers all accepting bitcoin.  Once it's everywhere and ubiquitous, people will accept it for what it is and this talk of a bubble should end.

I bet on red at the roulette table, I bet two whole bitcoins at those instances and made a couple hundred dollars. Now Im a young guy who is fortunate enough to be making decent money in real life, so I planned to invest and buy another 2 bitcoins if the price dipped before the fork. Now here's my current strategy that I plan to use, and please give your opinion on it. There's a lot of uncertainty with this next spin of the roulette wheel unlike the ones before and a black square is expected (yes, I know the red square might occur or it wont, but the probability is high compared to past history and nervous investors are sitting out).  I plan on selling all the bitcoins I have and then bet on spins soon after the black square.  Since i bet 6500, i'm not risking a large profit like people who bet $1-200-1000-2000 or even $4000. I can then bet on black without risking my money. However, I will lose the chance to get comps from the pit boss and get that free suite in the casino hotel. This way, if it does land on black repeatedly, I will not lose much and will make a small profit and if it does land on black several times in a row, I can bet after. This will also give me time to assess the spin history and decide which color to bet if the spins do indeed land on black repeatedly. I don't think it will happen, but I rather be cautious. If the future for red spins looks good, I will bet several times at once. I was prepared for the risk, but this is my first time in a casino and seems to be critical, so I rather take step back and learn. I honestly do believe that the future is in roulette and I plan on investing 50-70% of my wealth into gambling  after this spin. A lot of people say to not gamble with what you cannot afford to lose, but based on the world affairs and financial market, I believe we're on the crossroad of evolution. What do you guys think? 
tl;dr - Anyone telling you what the price will do at any give time is full of shit.  Buy, sell, it's gambling on what the market will do.  Just hold your coins, get the free ones and only sell if you are ready to get out completely because you no longer believe in the long term success of the coin.

I can agree that the signalling methods are "totally different".  However, if the mining pools intention is to fool you by signalling one thing then doing another, nothing about either method protects against this.

The world requires a currency that can withstand massive attacks from government alliances.  There will be attempts at regulation, outlawing it, military grade cyber-warfare attacks to stop it.   And here you are worried about a few confused consumers, and this worries you?

Ok, now you've confused me.  What is coinbase signalling?  I thought you mispelled coindance the first time you wrote it.  
As for 'version bits' being "real signalling" if you are afraid of a bad actor trying to throw you off by signalling one thing then doing another, how hard would it be for that same bad actor to run a version of the protocol that supports SegWit, then switch back to the previous version right before the final block is mined?  Seems equally do-able if you believe mining pools are out to fool you.

There is no guarantee that any amount of investment into bitcoin will make you rich.  However, consider this, recently bitcoin has been doubling in value every 1.7 months.
If that trend were to continue, a 500.00 investment will become 1 million dollars after doubling 11 times.  This would only be 1.5 years.
Yeah, pretty crazy isn’t it?

If no one uses, buys, trades, a coin, it's value goes way down.  Who wants to mine something with little value?  You can mine block after block, but with little exchange going on, and the price being very low, it won't be profitable to keep mining it.

The mistake that caused it to halt was an “off by one” mistake.  The fork was to start on a specific block once it was mined.  Blocks are numbered.
Block 0.  
Block 1.  
Block 2.  
Off by one happens when you reference “block 2” as the 3rd block, which it is, rather than its number.
This is a common coding mistake as some indexes start at zero and others start a one.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:15:24
Yep.  All I did was measure the big dips of 2017, then measure the percent increase of the following bull runs.  Applied that to the dip at the time and it showed quite simply that it would hit 7600 by now.  The guys I work with have been watching this develop and are looking forward to the next dip so we can do the math again.
We don’t think it’s a given but believe it’s the additional people getting into crypto with each dip and recovery that keeps propelling bitcoin higher at an increased rate each time.
This was a fun run, watching this prediction come true.  It will be interesting to see if this pattern repeats.

Didn't happen.  The Bitcoin blockchain has never been compromised.  Mistakes have been made by people transacting with the block chain (e.g. tricked into sending bitcoin to a hackers address on the block chain instead of where the user intended), but never has even a tiny fraction of a bitcoin been taken or altered on the block chain.  This is not because of good coding, but because of the math involved with linking each new block to the old.  
You can't change any item along the whole block chain without causing the hash codes to no longer match up.  Any changes would be invalidated and rejected the moment they are attempted.

For profit?  No.   
As a gamble, sure!
But consider this.  If the B2X coin ends up having value you sold yours away for nothing just before it was delivered.  
Day before fork, you have 1 BTC worth 7000.00.  You sell it, and wait for the price to drop.  
Day after the fork, BTC drops in price to 6500.00.  However, imagine B2X coin is worth 1000.00 at this time.  
You could have sold both on the day of the fork netting 7500.  This is why everyone is accumulating BTC right now.

But actually, if more people take advantage of it, the increased demand will drive the price up.  Therefore, the price being so much lower would indicate there is a reason people are not taking advantage of the price.  Maybe a better product is now available.  Maybe there is a design defect with this model TV.  Perhaps a study found that rare earth metals used to manufacture it have been found to cause cancer.   
There are many reasons the price of an item would drop so fast and very few of them are good reasons that would drive you to take advantage.  
A better example would be something like, “cell phones were very expensive when they were first available.  Few people had them and the service was very unreliable.  Now cell phones are cheap enough for everyone to afford one and service is very reliable.”   So to it may be with bitcoin.  Before it can be widely adopted it needs to be more reliable and cheap.   Then everyone can afford it and rely on it.

Others here answered your question, I will add this in case it is useful to you.  Bitcoin is limited to 21 million, and the number of decimal places currently supported for breaking it into smaller amounts is 18.   If there ever came a time when increasing the available bitcoins was needed, I think it would more likely be to increase the decimal places.  This would not dilute the holdings of anyone with bitcoins and it would allow the value for a single bitcoin to increase further since smaller cost transactions would then be possible.

In the Hub model I can see how Alice's payment finds its way to Bob, if a hub knows Bob is connected to it, then when Alice sends a payment addressed to Bob, the Hub sends it to Bob's address.  
However, I don't see how Alice's payment finds its way to Bob in the P2P model.  If Alice has a channel to Greg and to Nancy, by what mechanism does her payment select one or the other in its attempt to reach Bob?  This gets more complicated as the decision needs to be made at each hop along the way to Bob's address.  What guides the payment along a viable path?

There's a fork coming to BCH.  You could easily have known this by doing some research.  It happens every May 15th and November 15th.  
This time, the fork is contentious, because there are two different dev teams with different plans for this fork (SV vs ABC).   You could easily have known this by browsing other subreddits.   
So why is this affecting Bitcoin (BTC)?  Recently Craig Wright showed that his SV fork will have the support of a lot of hashpower that no one knew he had.  He proved he has the hashpower on the blockchain by mining more blocks than all the other pools combined.   Ok, still what's this have to do with BTC?  He's mining on BCH, after all, right?  Right.  So Jihan Wu who also has a shit-ton of hashpower (mostly mining on BTC) has stated that he will take hashpower away from BTC in response to the incoming hashpower attack from Craig Wright.  
For BTC, there's the potential of losing a lot of hashpower at the same time the difficulty adjustment is about to trigger.   
So all of this creates uncertainty...which traders/investors don't like.  If you have a small amount of skin in the game, you have an opportunity to bet right and make some money.  If you have a lot of skin in the game, you'd rather sit this out, and come back after the dust settles.  
So to answer your question OP...that's just a little bit of what's contributing to this sell off... you can see from this sampling of recent events;  any given selloff has its own specific causes.

I don't know, but I'm sure the truth will get vetted out pretty quickly.  
There's another thread discussing this.  They are saying the address belonged to Hal Finney, not Satoshi..also that the transaction in 2017 was TO that address, not FROM that address.  So it might not even be Hal Finney's signature, just someone sending a transaction TO an old Hal Finney address and trying to conflate that with being Satoshi.   
So far, it's not looking good for this being the real Satoshi, but we'll see in due time.

Google "sell the rumor, buy the news."   When dealing with a volatile equity such as bitcoin, you can't easily predict if it will go up or down at any given point...however using the old "sell the rumor, buy the news" strategy, you can pretty safely sell while the rumor of bad news is hot, but once the fear is cleared away by the actual event, you must buy back in because you are now reset to a state of not knowing what the equity will do.

@_date: 2018-02-11 20:06:42
That's close but not quite right.  When two people open a channel they both have bitcoin on the block chain.  The process of opening a payment channel moves an equal amount of bitcoin from each person to a new multi-sig address where both users private keys are required to move it in the future when the channel is closed.  So the bitcoin is actually on the block chain the entire time.  It is only control of the bitcoin on the block chain that is moved to the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:05:21
I'm not sure myself, but I'll throw this out there for discussion...
1.  Every node does not have the same view of the mempool.  
2.  Sometimes, by shear luck a block gets mined immediately after the previous block.  
If the mempool is less than 1MB, then a block will clear it.  If a second miner finds the solution to the next block before receiving many transactions it will mine a non-full block, other miners may see more transactions in the mempool at this time to their determination would be to invalidate that properly mined block.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:27:31
An optimistic view could be that your transaction is stuck in the mempool.  
Look here: [
and here: [
Right now, Bitcoin has 3.75 MB of pending transactions.  The median fee is .35 usd.  If Bitsy paid a small network fee this could be what's holding up your transaction.

You might find what you are looking for, but if you don’t, this is sort of close...
In the iPhone Stock App, track global price of bitcoin/usd by adding BTC-USD, other fiat currencies are available.
Then you can set your watch to use the Infograph Modular face.  Inside this face you can add a graph with stock price from the stock app, so pick the BTC ticker you just added.   
This will put a price graph, with amount increase or decrease, and current price, in the center of the watch face.  Then there are five other areas in that watch face you can customize for date, time, weather, etc..

True for the short term, and even then it was probabilistic/luck.   At the time he made the statement the only information he had was how quickly the price of bitcoin had gone up, that's it.
It would be the same if he were told Amazon's share price just went from 950 to 2000 and without looking at why, not checking P/E ratio, not looking at market capitalization, not looking at underlying company fundamentals, not checking for mergers, acquisitions, or spin-offs, without reading a prospectus or any analyst reviews of Amazon; basically without a single shred of due diligence into the merit of the rise in price; he were to say, "950 to 2000?!  It's a bubble!".
Finally, since we are talking about Cuban specifically, keep in mind that once he did the required reading, he not only changed his mind/stance but started investing his own money "during the bubble!"

True, but most people buying in recently had gains through December and then losses in the next tax year.  Ouch.  
They have to pay tax on those gains without being able to cash out their crypto at those highs.

ok...now you are confusing reality with magic and the psychic ability to predict where the price will be in 6 months.  Why waste everyone's time with this crap?
"Buy the Dip" simply means it is lower RIGHT NOW, and you can see/confirm that the price is really what it is RIGHT NOW.  No predicting, no psychic ability needed... just buy it cheaper today than you could have gotten it yesterday.  Nobody knows how low it will go on this dip, nor does anyone know how high or low it will be in 6 months.  We do believe in the technology, we believe in its utility, we believe it is grossly undervalued at any price its ever been at.  The cheaper we can buy it, the better off we'll be when it takes its rightful place in the history of humanity.

When you place an order on Coinbase it is a market order, going to whomever has the lowest buy order at that instant.  You can also place a market order on GDAX, which will charge a fee.   So you want to place a limit buy order where you set your purchase price below the market and wait for the price to come down a bit to meet your price.  There is no fee for limit orders.

I won't go into specifics for obvious reasons, but you can create something that you can store in plain site or online with a little creativity.  Here's an example of one possible method... 
Get a piece of paper.  Write your recovery pass phrase down on it with space for extra words.  Make the extra words something that will seem random but that you will know you added them.  For example, if you had a dog named Trouper when you were a kid, make "Trouper" one of the extra words you mix in.   Or perhaps you had a girlfriend in highschool who's last name was Baker, then put "Baker" in the passphrase too.  The point is, these extra words will jump out at you as familiar enough to know that you added them to the actual passphrase, so you know to remove them.
Then for the PIN number, make it a number that you will know but others won't even if they see your hint.  Create a hint first and then a number based on that hint.  For example, if your first car was a camaro with a 3.04 liter engine, then make your hint, "One Camaro part", this will remind you that your pin is   
One - 1  
Camaro Part (3.04 Liter engine) - 3 0 4  
1304  
Anyone coming across the phrase "One Camaro Part" will have no idea that for you this translates into 1304.
Once you have a single piece of paper with all you'd need to personally reconstruct your pin and passphrase, type it all up on your computer or phone and store it online where you'll always be able to get to it.  Even if it ever falls into the hands of hackers/thieves it will be useless to them.  Encrypting the file you store it in online is a great idea too.
Do not put any reference to what wallet you are using in your recovery page.  Which wallet to use your recovery on should be something you just remember doing because after all, you set it up.
I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has other ideas on this.  Please respond/share.

Thanks for jumping in... I was hoping OP could give a better answer.  You've just partially described Onion Routing and while that may be how the payment is handled along the way, it doesn't give the payment a path to begin with.

OP confuses "Buy the dip" with "buy the bottom"
OP, nobody is claiming to know how far bitcoin will drop, they just know that they can get it cheaper today than yesterday, and that will make a big difference in 10 years.
Example:  Say I have 9000 to invest in bitcoin.  If I bought last week at 4500, I'd have 2 coins.   If bitcoin goes to 10,000 in 10 years; I'll have 20,000 worth, not bad.
Right now, it's at 3845.  If I buy this dip, I'll have 2.34 bitcoin.  If bitcoin goes to 10,000 in 10 years, I'll have 23,407.00.

I suspected this, but was hoping that perhaps some version of Flare or perhaps a newer revision of it had been implemented for this test phase of LN on mainnet.  Why isn't that testing Rusty mentioned back in 2016 being done now?  
Also, I'm very curious about *how* all channels are known by all nodes?  Is this broadcast by every node and at what frequency?  This just brings up more questions about how the current implementation of LN is working. 
I look at this: 
every day.  I like that the number of nodes keeps increasing, but I still wonder what it currently takes for other nodes to discover a new node.  Are they all broadcasting their channel statuses?  Is there some directory that they all update?  If there's no Flare Protocol or some variant, then how is this being done?
Thanks for your reply by the way!

My understanding was that the vault was simply cold storage where Coinbase kept your private keys offline.  They still had the private key at the time of the fork.  Only they can access your BCH for you.
Contact support.  An email should do it.

Very cool!  My question is regarding payment path finding through the LN.  Now that you are connected to the LN, are you currently able to transact with any other users or only to a subset of well known nodes on LN?

Cool, thanks again.  Knowing the nodes are broadcasting really helps my interpretation of the data showing the growth of the LN.
I agree that I don't think the problems are unsolvable.  They are very interesting and difficult though.  
In the network world, we've had Link State protocols for decades now.  Routers (nodes) advertise routes they know along with current link states to those routes.  If a link (circuit) goes down, only the link state needs to be updated to routing peers (nodes).  This removed the need to send the whole routing table with every update. 
This was a dramatic improvement over routing protocols that broadcast everything at regular intervals like RIP, for example.
Seems to me that eventually someone will work out how to do "Channel State Updates".  It will be interesting to see what that might look like.
Do you happen to know how frequently LN nodes broadcast their channel status?

First, Bitcoin can't be banned because it's distributed all over the globe with no single controlling entity.  Ok, so no matter what a single government does, bitcoin continues...just maybe without that country.
Now, what it that country happens to be your country?  Well, in that case I don't think a ban will stick.  Bitcoin will continue in the world and the citizens of any single country that bans it will elect new leaders if they are a democracy or revolt if not a democracy.   Could be an odd revolution where they simply move to a country where their bitcoins are still usable.
My only question/concern is how long something like this could take to play out.  But I have no doubt that Bitcoin is here...and it's not going anywhere.  The only question is how hard the established traditional bankers and their government backed fiat money will fight the inevitable.
The best case scenario is that both governments and banks embrace the block chain technologies for their improved utility and become a part of the future sooner rather than later.

So true.  I work with a lot of traders who have the old world view of things and haven't done any homework on Bitcoin but will spout off at moments notice about how Bitcoin is in a bubble, will crash etc...  I usually ask them one of two questions just for my own laughs...
1.  Did you see the closing price of Bitcoin yesterday?  Love it when they actually try to act like they "saw the close" or heard what it was, "didn't it close around 5500 or something?"  
2.  If you and so many people are so sure bitcoin is a fraud, why doesn't the SEC or the FBI storm Bitcoin headquarters and shut it down?  They usually light up excitedly and say, "yes, that's probably what will happen to it."  
That they don't even realize these are trick questions confirms that they have no idea what Bitcoin is.

The segment reminded me of the sort of coverage the Internet got in the mid 1990’s.  
They know there is something new with lots of interest building but have no idea how to present it to their viewers.  
1.  They barely have a grasp of cryptos themselves.  
2.  They have no idea how to present something so new and somewhat technical to their audience because there is nothing to compare it to.  
When the media first tried to explain email, no one could get their head around it.  “If someone sends me an email, I have to find a computer to read it?  Who would want to do this?”  “Why don’t they just send mail to my house and I can get it from my own mailbox.”
Now, if you have no good examples of how email will work, just imagine trying to explain potential uses of the Internet like Facebook, Amazon, and so on.   Now that we have examples of Internet technologies in our everyday life it’s easy to explain similar things, like saying, “Facebook is like MySpace”.  Incremental technology changes have readily available examples to give the public.  But remember how no one thought Apple could make a cell phone and the concept of a smartphone was rudimentary at best.  Apps?  That are tiny? And only work on my phone? No thanks!  Then the iPad was coming and people asked, “why would anyone want the iPad?  It’s just a bigger iPhone without the phone?!”  
Revolutionary technology advances have no prior examples to spoon feed the public.  They won’t understand it until suddenly it’s everywhere and they can’t avoid it.

Hypocrites?  I'm learning about Bitcoin... I'm pretty sure the white paper said that anyone (ANYONE) can fire up a mining node and mine bitcoin.  Oh wait...did the white paper you read say that only people who agree with you on other principles are allowed to mine it?  Who's the hypocrite?
So many techno-nerds sound like children who want to "take my ball and go home, so nobody can play if I'm not quarterback"  
Listen up people...this is business...this is the real world.  Trading real money is not always a zero sum game.  Anyone leaving money on the table because of hurt feelings is either an idiot or a child.  
Buying bitcoin was easy for me, it's worked out well.  I still haven't bought any bitcoin cash, at first because I believed it would crash to zero soon after the fork.  Now the only reason I haven't bought at least a few is because the playing field is not level.  Bitcoin (core) has a huge First Mover advantage with more support from more exchanges and retailers accepting Bitcoin.  
Once the playing field is leveled, I hope my investment in Bitcoin is protected by more than hurt feelings and shouts of "not fair!!"

Yes, but the coins are tethered to the big macs.  1 coin = 1 big mac.  
It doesn't matter how many coins they produce, for each coin you have, you get the same value for each.  The price of a Big Mac can go up or down in fiat currency but these new coins will always be equal to 1 Big Mac.

An objective explanation will be great if we get one.  I doubt it though, people on both sides of the fork are overly passionate.
From what I have gathered there was a meeting in New York on how to scale Bitcoin.  An agreement was reached that called for two solutions.
1.  On Block Scaling - increase the block size from 1MB to a larger size (2MB).  Bigger blocks means each block can handle more transactions.  
2.  Off Block Scaling - Keep the block size the same but add Segregated Witness which is a ledger of transactions that will be settled onto the block chain later.  
Recently BTC forked to add SegWit and this is where we are today.   
In November, there might be another fork to implement the block size increase by doubling it (2x).  This fork is referred to as SegWit2x because it includes the SegWit we already have with a block size that is 2X our current 1MB (SegWit2x).   So it's not doing anything with SegWit, just keeping it, and adding the 2MB block size.  
Personally, I have no idea which approach is best.  Getting people to say which is best is when it gets heated.  It can feel like you are talking to a Sunni Muslim describing what's wrong with the Shiites Muslims.  There's only 1% difference in their religions but boy oh boy do they hate each other.

I'm starting to think governments are bluffing at this point.  They could have stopped bitcoin when it was in its infancy, but now it's too big, to distributed, with too much computing power, and too much money in it.
The reason it's too late to ban is that a ban on it now would just prove how unstoppable it is.  Imagine China shuts down the exchanges today.  Chinese citizens with bitcoin keys will still have them.  They will still increase in value, and they will either find a way to spend them in China, or find themselves traveling to more crypto friendly nations to use their bitcoins.  There's no way for a government to stop you from leaving their country with bitcoins they way they stop you with fiat cash today.
Another thing that may happen is decentralized exchanges become available and everything continues inside China regardless of their laws/regulations.
On the other hand, simply threatening/bluffing about banning exchanges (again, everyone should realize that even the chinese government realizes they can't "ban bitcoin" so they threaten the exchanges within their borders) has impacted the price of bitcoin and driven some people out of bitcoin.  Anything to slow down bitcoin is good for the traditional bankers.
tl;dr - China banning exchanges now would illustrate to the world that bitcoin can't be stopped which will have the opposite effect the chinese goverment is going for.

Not sure which part you are saying would cause a price drop...
Imagine that several high value individuals invested 10 million usd into Bitcoin on january 1st 2017.  On the last day of 2017, they had 13 times what they started with.  So now they have 130 million dollars.  117 million of that is profit that they need to pay taxes on. 
Being in the highest tax bracket (39.6%) they owe 46.33 million to the IRS on April 17th or they have to pay even more because of penalties.
Simply put, they are cashing out a lot of their Bitcoin to pay those taxes to avoid having to pay even more tax penalties.
When you start selling 46 million worth of Bitcoin, you are going to get less and less for it as you are competing with all the others trying to sell at the same time.  There's nothing they can do about this because they are forced to sell.  They can't just HODL and wait for a higher price.  This drives the price down as we've seen over the last month.  
Now that the selling for tax bills has ended, Bitcoin is rising back up because there are no BIG SELLERS being forced to sell on a short time scale.

Well said, however the reality today is that many merchants need to convert Bitcoin to fiat.  They also need to calculate an every changing conversion rate from their fiat to btc for pricing goods.   These needs create an opportunity for payment processors to step in and handle this for merchants so that they can focus on their business rather than keeping up with crypto tech and crypto price fluctuations.

We were expecting nice government funding but the Internet went in a more distributed non government controlled way, thankfully.  
I can’t tell if you are reading Wikipedia or if you lived through it.  As someone who not only lived through the early days of the Internet but was involved in building it, crypto today feels much more like the 90s.  
Best example, in the early 90s it was still hard to explain what the Internet was to my mother, she hadn’t even heard of it.  By the mid 90s everyone was hearing about it but most didn’t understand it.  Just like crypto today.

For starters, the title to the post says LN has been compromised which would indicate some sort of hack or exploit, then the article says nothing about this.  It goes into detail on growth metrics and concludes that LN is failing and/or is centralized.  And if that is the case THEN it could be attacked in a ddos attack.  Ok, so it hasn’t been attacked, but it could be if it is centralized... but then the article says the reason LN may only appear to be centralized is because new nodes come online to check things out then go away leaving just the long standing nodes.  Ok so maybe it’s not centralized and maybe not subject to attack and maybe hasn’t been compromised... ugh... my head hurts trying to explain it.

But limiting supply only increases price if it is limited beyond what is available to trade.
For example, the limited supply of bitcoin has no effect on the price today, it is only the float, or what is available for trading that matters.  They could hold the coins with the same effect.

Exactly this.  It takes 8 times as many transactions to fill a single block with high fee transactions.  Bitcoin has small blocks so a single block can be filled with spam easily forcing other transactions with lower fees to wait for the next block and the next and so on.   Btrash doesn’t have this problem because their blocks are too big to fill and even if you did fill them it would cost 8 times as much to do it.  
May 15th it gets even harder as they will use a hard fork to upgrade from 8MB blocks to 32MB blocks.

One year ago bitcoin was below 2000.  At the time I couldn’t bribe people to buy it.   In December they finally bought in, then lost their asses in January and don’t want anything to do with it as if they should have never bought any.  The truth is they should have listened back in May and bought then.  Today they would be positive.  
I hope they hold, but suspect most have cashed out.  When the price rebounds they will have more difficulty buying back in, because of emotions.  
When you start worrying about your investment, do more research.  Decide for yourself if you think the future is crypto currencies.

Nothing about the number on my arm tells anyone to divide it by another number.  Also, you can multiply, square root it, xor it, whatever you like that is easy for you to remember but impossible for someone else to figure out.  
Maybe I will use 91,733,851 but think that’s hard to remember... so instead I remember it as 451 cubed.   The point is you can come up with some formula that’s easy for you to remember but impossible for someone to figure out.  
So the number on my arm is only half or less of the equation.  No one else even knows what type of equation it is used with, much less the other number(s).

I would convert the seed words to their numeric values.  Then string them together to make one long number.  I would divide that number by a secret number, 451 for example.  Then I have the result of that tattooed to my arm in plain sight.

The spam issue has always seemed to be a joke to me.  If your product is built to make money from usage and someone can attack it by using it, you need to fix your product.
I'm holding my BTC because I hope it can fix these shortcomings.  I invest in other cryptos because they appear to have already solved these problems or are solving them in the near future according to their roadmaps (Plasma, Sharding, etc).  
I continually re-evaluate, so my investments are subject to change according to mostly technology advancements or failures.  Rarely do the conspiracy theories factor into my investment decisions.  
For example, Craig S. Wright could decide tomorrow that he's been wrong all along and now supports only BTC.  It won't change my mind about BTC by one bit.   Then if Roger Ver suddenly decides BTC and Lighting are the holy grail of crypto and he was wrong all along, I still don't give a crap.  I'm not selling my BTC.  Likewise, the drama between BTC and BCH zealots don't push my money one way or the other either.
So yeah, I stick by my assertion that these theories of attacks on Bitcoin by deep pocketed fraudsters sound ridiculous to me.  If it turned out to be true, I'd sell my BTC immediately because it's too weak to withstand something so easily contrived.  But BTC is still standing, still the highest market cap, so no...I don't believe the conspiracy theories.

As soon as your human brain detects a pattern and decides you should sell “this time” before the dip, ask yourself this, “are you the only one feeling this way?”  Probably not.  So what happens if a bunch of regular holders sell?  The price dips a bit, and more pile on, then the whales move in, they buy the shit out of it driving the price up fast so you and the others are scrambling to buy back in (FOMO) while it’s rising.    Then the whales sell again...cycle repeats.  
The whales don’t trade on feelings.   They will eat your lunch when you do.   Just HODL.

Have you stopped beating your wife?
See how that works?  You answer no, and you acknowledge that you once did beat your wife.  You answer yes and you acknowledge that you do beat your wife.  Of course the trick is that the statement assumes an unspoken premise that you have beaten your wife.


Another example of a statement with an unspoken assumption as the premise.  I don't believe that spamming is a thing.
Before I can adopt your belief in spamming, I would need to believe that a thief is robbing me by stuffing my wallet with money.  
But but but... let me suspend my disbelief for the sake of argument... if the miners can spam the bitcoin block chain with transactions that fill up the mempool to raise fees... the simple solution is to raise the block size so that the spam transactions get wiped out with each block mined.  It would also cost more and more for miners to keep trying to fill the blocks.. so essentially this line of reasoning would lead me to becoming a big blocker.  
Not only that...but when Lightning Network gets widely adopted as a 2nd layer scaling solution... the 1st level (block chain) layer will still be vulnerable to spam attacks (if you believe spam attacks are real).  Nothing is being done to protect BTC from supposed spam attacks (because they are not real).  If I shared your beliefs I would sell my BTC.  I don't, so I won't.

My thoughts off the top of my head...  
Decentralized - not under control of any govt, company, or institution.  
Immutable - Once somethings goes onto the block chain...it never changes.  
Trust-less - No need to trust any third party when transacting.  No permission needed.  No assistance needed.  
Scalable - Not only does it need to handle payment volume comparable to Visa, but something entirely new... micro transactions.  People can be paid in bitcoin by the minute with bitcoin streaming to them for every minute they work.  When streaming a movie or song, again it bitcoin should be able to handle the micro-transactions necessary to pay the content provider for every minute viewed.

I think the hashrate has to drop now as we are so close to a difficulty adjustment.  If the hashrate stays high the difficulty to mine will go way up in less than 2 days.  The miners usually back off this close to the adjustment and then ramp back up right after.   There is a difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks which is roughly every 2 weeks.

There is a delay of 48 hours to move from the Coinbase vault to the Coinbase wallet.  I started that Thursday and it finished right on time.

If a con artist can get you to believe you are going to get something for nothing or for way less than it should cost you, then he has you on his hook.  The best way to avoid being scammed is to not try to be a scammer.  For example, stop trying to take advantage of Nigerian princes who have fallen on hard times.  Or that time they mistook you for the relative of someone who died unexpectedly leaving vast sums of money to someone with a similar name and you didn't tell them it's not your dead uncle.

My understanding is that you never actually have or hold your bitcoin.  Each tiny increment of bitcoin exists in the block chain at a fixed location and never moves.  We have a private key that creates a public key which is written into the block chain to show ownership of the bitcoins.   The bitcoins never move, just the public key associated with them changes.  
Ok, so you bought bitcoin on an exchange.  This means the exchange created a private key for you, and generated a public key with it that was written to the block chain.  Unless you create your own private key and generate a public key for the exchange to transfer your bitcoin to, the exchange is in control of your private key and your bitcoin.  
If the exchange has your private key and the block chain forks, there will be two different block chains with all the same public keys which can be controlled by the private keys.  If the exchange doesn't want to give you access to your coins on one of the forked block chains, you are out of luck because they have the private key, not you.  
Someone please fact check me and correct me if I got anything wrong.
Edit - so to answer OPs question about Breadwallet... since you have your private keys, you will control the public keys on any forked/duplicate block chain that gets created.   So you should be safe from forks.

1. and 2. are true only because anyone making predictions doesn't know what Goldman Sachs is doing.
You can check the fundamentals, then check the charts, get a summation from analysts, then decide something is going up and make your move...then Goldman just decides they want it to go down...so you're screwed.

Am I the now one who read the Goldman analysis 2 weeks ago?  The dip they predicted was last week.  So either ignore the article as just more technical voodoo non-sense, or believe it and expect BTC to head for 3600 now.

It may be too late for people with bitcoin in the Coinbase vault.  Now people are reporting that there is a 72 hour delay on transfers out of the Coinbase wallet.
48 hours to get out of the vault.  
Another 72 hours to transfer out of the wallet.

Now, nobody has any FUD related reasons to sell.  We all HODL, the rest of the world has a green light to buy bitcoin now, but it's going to cost them since nobody who has them will sell cheap anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:16:52
BTC is at 2472 right now.   We will see where it goes from here.  I'm not predicting it will go up, but believe it has an equal chance of going up from here as down.  
Edit 7/27/2012 - So... BTC never did that 8% drop you were expecting.  I hope you didn't sell.  BTC @ 2563 now.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:24:17
Do not sell it.  Hold onto it.  It is not at risk of anything happening to it because of bitcoin cash.  
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:56:20
It is confusing.   Basically, regardless of all the signaling and bips that are locked in, etc...   there is a group of miners who will make a copy of the bitcoin block chain on august 1st and create a new coin called bitcoinABC which is based on a proposal called bitcoin cash.
On august 1st, everyone who has in their possession a private key to their bitcoins, will also find themselves holding keys to bitcoin on the newly created coins.
If you leave your private keys under someone else's control, you most likely won't get those new coins.
This is why everyone says to create your own private key and move control from the exchanges to your key.
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:21:22
My idea is simple.  Bitcoin will change the world.  Bitcoin is starting to change the world by giving more and more people in all countries access to a non government controlled currency.  Once bitcoin changes the world, its value will have increased many many times.  
Bitcoin has not changed the world yet.  Bitcoin has not reached it's true potential yet.   Bitcoins value is still at Pre-revolutionary prices.  
Hold onto your bitcoin until after it revolutionizes the world.  When it is time to sell your bitcoin, you won't have to, because your bitcoin will be the money.
The simple fact that you are considering exchanging bitcoin for some other currency proves the bitcoin future has not arrived.
Hold on to it and wait for the future to arrive.

This.   As more and more companies accept bitcoin, the value of bitcoin goes up.  Once bitcoin reaches a level where I want to use it for a big purchase, I will just use bitcoin.  New house?  Buy it with bitcoin.  New car?  Vacation?  Kids collage tuition?  Bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin.  Coffee?  Litecoin!

Ok...follow me on this then.  If you move to a hardware key, you set it up with a passphrase and a pin code.  If you ever lose the hardware key, those can be used to regenerate your private key on a new hardware key.
So here is what you do.  After you are setup on the hardware key, you destroy it.  Now the only place access exists is inside your head.  Not in your house, not in a bank, but inside your brain.  When you want your money, you get a new hardware key, use the passphrase and pin code that you memorized and bingo!  You have access to money that doesn't exist without your brain.

How do they make money doing this?  Or is this just a way f accumulating valid cell phone numbers of people who own crypto.  Specifically BTC, eth, and LTC.  Same coins offered on Coinbase.  Same app known for people getting their coins stolen by having their phone number hijacked.   I will pass on this free offer.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:08:39
Opinions vary.  Invest in other coins if you like, but I suggest that you never sell your bitcoin.  The rate at which bitcoin doubles in value has been accelerating until the fear of multiple forks in the bitcoin block chain ramped up.  Now that it's mostly behind us, and with the success of bip91 showing how the next few changes are likely to go, we are likely to see bitcoins value increase accelerate again.
If you invest 1000 usd into bitcoin and it doubles 10 times you will have 1 million usd in value.  Before the recent correction it was doubling every 3 months.  At that rate, it would take your 1000 just 2.5 years to reach 1 million.   And that's if the doubling rate stays static and does not increase in frequency.  Bitcoin is not old, it is just getting started.
Other coins can burst ahead for quick gains, but only bitcoin has shown it has true staying power and has the most market capitalization.

This was new in June, things in crypto space have changed with more and more people getting in.  Simple supply and demand.  For a long time we only had a couple million people swapping bitcoin.  Suddenly, we started adding millions.  And then, the growth stalled as Augy One loomed as the bitcoin boogey man.   Now that's clearing up, and we are back to the influx of new money which will keep driving the price up as demand increases exponentially.

Not to mention historians dispute the account that tulip mania affected more than a handful of merchants.  The tulip price bubble lasted only one year.  Plus the total Dutch republic population was barely 1 million people 100 years later.  So really, how wide spread could tulip mania have been?
Most importantly, why would anyone use the disputed story of tulip mania, which at worst still only affected a small population of a few hundred thousand people when making predictions about the worldwide phenomenon that is bitcoin.  It's cliche to say "this time it's different" but it is so very different.  For one, we have an Internet, providing instant communication worldwide.

Yeah, I got my start on coinbase, just a couple of months ago.  it was quick and easy and since then I've learned so much.  But after seeing how Coinbase would go down when there is a big rally and lots of demand, and then hearing the horror stories of people getting locked out of their accounts, and now this?

Now, famous investor, Jim Rogers, has just released a new warning saying the same. He is even using biblical references to warn of a financial tsunami that could take place either this year or next.  He has just said, “A $68 trillion ‘Biblical’ collapse is poised to wipe out millions of Americans.”

I don't think it's a good idea to try and persuade people to buy cryptos.  If they buy it just because they think it's going up and they want to make a quick buck, they'll be panic selling withing a week and will be contributing to the volatility we see everyday.  I think it's better for everyone if we let those people panic and sell now, and then not replace them with new panic sellers who don't understand what they are buying or why.
I just tell people to look into the underlying technology for themselves.  If you believe in the promise of crytpo currencies, then keep buying and hodling them.  The longer it takes others to get into it, the more you'll have by then.

If I'm not mistaken, or if this is old information... every 10 minutes new bitcoins are created and every node tries to match a public key to it.  First one to randomly hit the key wins the bitcoins.
In the future (2140?), all bitcoins will be mined.  At that time nodes will be compensated with transaction fees.  The node that gets to handle a transaction will be selected by being first to match the hash created by the transaction.
I'm just learning this stuff...so this is a very rough explanation from a noob.  YMMV
