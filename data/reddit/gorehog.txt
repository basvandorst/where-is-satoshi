Yeah they are... They're libertaians who love Trump for his anti establishment rhetoric and business ethos.
Now they're hearing this and either suffering cognitive dissonance or saying "well, he also couldn't make money on a casino so I'll go take muh gainz..."

How do you feel about being a Putin puppet state?
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:02:29
Ha! I know many Iibertarians who voted Trump in spite of his negative traits only because of his outsider business ethics.
Sorry, the polling shows. You may be an outlier but the facts are the facts. Libertarians helped elect this garbage fire.
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:04:11
Oh, right. Economic controls fall right into libertarian values.

I'm sorry but nothing happens in the block chain at zero cost. The expense of computation is the base charge to store the value. And the cost to replicate the block chain across all the storage devices that keep a duplicate of the ledger.
It's not free.

If chagning how money works means giving them faster tools to do their work without oversight and public invovement.
@_date: 2019-02-16 15:25:06
What reforms?
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:20:11
People have cracked public/private keys in the past. DVDJon springs to mind. I'm just not certain it matters here. Don't you need to freely distribute the private key in Bitcoin to create new miners?
@_date: 2019-12-24 21:42:53
They can just turn off internet access, you know? It's not like you have lots of different on ramps. What, like two or three providers in a region?
Also, what will you do with that BTC? Can't exchange it for local currency because that'll be illegal in this scenario.
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:10:14
Yeah but those can be cheap armies since you've already disarmed the population.
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:37:55
Thanks for your reply. It's very good.




Yes, minting the original supply has a finite cost. To my understanding updating the ledger to correctly record transactions has an increasing cost as more transactions are recorded.
You can't shorten the history. The consensus depends on everyone storing the same blockchain and updating it in a timely manner.
So, for the thing to have value you must be storing, processing, and transmitting thousands of copies of increasingly longer databases.






It's just an engineering problem.
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:39:18
Yeah and let's watch as that solution crumbles. See, people aren't going to have jobs as automation replaces us all.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:23:34
Actually...I might be wrong about that. I need to reconsider my statement.
@_date: 2019-12-24 20:06:32
Right, because there's NO WAY that oppressive goverments could ever block access to your shared ledger of internet money.
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:21:17
I thought that bitcoin transactions are NOT anonymous. Here, from the FAQ... 






@_date: 2019-12-24 21:45:51
It only works because the exchange handles the conversion for you. Once government makes that illegal your funds would be frozen.
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:33:10
He doesn't understand why Bitcoin can fail. I do. Here's an exercise anyone should be able to do. Can you run the red team arguments against your own point of view and respond to them in a meaningful way?
How do you respond to the fact that BTC requires constantly increasing resouces to maintain its ledger and each transacion? How do you address the question of it being dependent on the security of one base private key and if that is ever discovered or released then the ledger collapses?
Are you prepared for those criticisims?
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:22:40






@_date: 2019-12-16 11:41:50
Awful. It should've grown in value based on utility, not as a foreign currency.

How did he respond to your concerns regarding the linear power consumption to adoption rate?
@_date: 2019-01-19 21:21:38
That's an extra job for the merchant. Why bother with it?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:11:33
It was at 18,000. It's around 10k now, sometimes breaking 11k but it has nearly lost 50%.
Even so, let them ban it. No matter. All they can do is limit the trading for fiat. They can't stop the tech from existing and it's going to march forward.

There is nothing scarce about Bitcoin. There is all you can need. It's simply a matter of subdividing it.

You can't make an informed choice if information is hidden.
Illegal manipulation != Honest volatility.
Most libertarians will tell you that some level of regulation is necessary to limit illegal activity. The problem with regulation is the chilling effect it has on honest business, not criminals.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:52:31
People don't have a choice to participate. If you don't know the market is being manipulated then you can't make a decision based on honest input. That's why manipulation is illegal.
Moreover the SEC and FED both have laws that allow them to oversee the operations of other exchanges and trading entities. Why shouldn't the same apply to crypto currency?
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:23:00
Isn't that an interesting question? Maybe they're asking because they suspect that all the dollars we're putting into the crypto market is coming back out into someone else's pocket. Maybe they're trying to protect against pump and dumps and other market manipulations.
Maybe this is a maneuver by the old fiscal conservatives who're afraid of progress?
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:24:49
Now really. Pump and dumps are illegal market manipulations.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:29:26
Yeah or it could be a certain distrust for a currency that depends on volunteers generating the coin and processing the transactions. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:18:02
So really the only difference is the license? Why do you think you'll be permitted to transmit high power to orbit without a license?
The current limitation is about a 1/4 watt without a license except for special devices.

What does this have to do with the meme which I am commenting on?
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:32:26


Are you suggesting that gaming isn't a hobby?
And who said I'm proposing a solution for everyone?

The manufacturer serves as the licensee in those cases. So will the Starlink, I imagine.

@_date: 2018-12-19 11:08:49
Good point but the meme is still scammy as shit. Let's bitch about banning cryptocoins when the real problem is a failure of real utility.

Still, providing support and logistics is expensive. Also, once we stop using their oil we have no reason to be there. Once we leave we're no longer the visible enemy. They'll fall upon one another very quickly and forget all about us.

Why do you think more surveillance helps? There's no evidence that it does. In fact the evidence seems to suggest that they'll find ways to corrupt anything. Can't plant a bomb? Go on a stabbing spree. Can't get a knife? Steal a van and drive it into a crowd.
It seems to be continuing without showing signs of abating. You know, it's not like they're hiring people to watch all those camera feeds in real time. 
It's the theater of security. It seems like they're doing something but they're not. 
You want to stop terrorism? Disengage from the terrorist nations. Get off oil, it's a strategic weak point. Starve them out. Make them beg you to buy their products.
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:25:49
OK. A pattern of poor decisions doesn't prove prior planning. 
I'm not trying to defend the moves towards isolationism. I just think that if you're looking for bogeymen in the closet thirty years ago you're wasting time and energy. Really, it doesn't matter. What matters is, what can we do to stop the slide today?
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:54:53
I think there's a third option that we're ignoring. Stop burning petrochemicals. Seriously.
Never mind carbon sequestration and global warming. Let's not talk about that at all. Let's talk about waging an economic war against terrorists.
The oil producing nations in the Middle East depend on oil money. That's a fact. It's not like you buy clothes made in Egypt or cars manufactured in Jordan. No cellphones being made in Iraq. Thru depend on oil money. When we go looking for oil elsewhere it's a beta move. They set the market price for oil. They look at what we're spending to create alternate oil sources and they drop the price of oil, increase production, and bankrupt our oil fields. That's economic warfare and we keep fighting on their turf. Then some of that oil money goes to fund terrorism.
Here's what I'm saying. You want to end chronic extremist Islamic terrorism? Stop burning oil. It's great for lubricants, making fertilizer, making plastics, tons of stuff. Stop burning it, spend a couple of billion on a strategic initiative to start a hydrogen infrastructure based on renewables, and then, within a few years, before we even finish the conversion, we change the economic profile. Suddenly we have control of the trade balance and they starve out. They would then need to be productive. Not just drilling oil. Actually making durable goods.
Force those oil drilling religious zealots to do something useful. Just stop burning their oil.

Wow, great strawman! Too bad the problem is actually not the government banning it but rather the people not using it!
You're crying and whining about a "ban" but you can't be bothered to develop an implementation, can you you scammer? You expected to get rich quick and now you're trying to pump interest into the market by playing it as an anti-establishment heroic action?
Are you joking?
The problem with all crypto is the lack of a killer app. No one cares because there's no really feasible use yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:51:06
You're making a logical fallacy here. You're stating that the result must have been predetermined. Why can't it just be bad responses to current events?
