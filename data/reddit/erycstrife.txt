I agree with a freedom of choice. However, people need to stop picking sides. They're great minds working on both bitcoin and litecoin dev teams. Included other alt coins. People are so gun-ho about Bitcoin that they're blinded by the possibilities or the advantages of having alternative currencies in case major flaws occur with bitcoin. Otherwise, it's like me saying: Visa is WAY better than Mastercard. They both do the same things in different ways.

That's pretty closed minded to say that you will not support any business that supports litecoin. That's what many people said about bitcoin when it first started. I'm saying that there is room for more than one cryptocurrency. There doesn't have to be just one coin. One can act as a back up for another. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:44:04
No. It should just put it into your coinbase account. I don't really know the actual happenings behind the scenes but it seems to just place it in people's coinbase accounts if they have it open in Chrome.

Well, there isn't much to post on that subject other than you will now have access to apps created by coinbase or other bitcoin wallets. As far as apps which will replace old ones, I'm not to sure. I think the hardest part about Android is that its like switching from OSX to Windows 8. They have an "easy mode" which simplifies a lot of what android can do for you. Otherwise, it's all about getting used to how Android works compared to iOS. Believe me, I was scared to make the switch (I've purchased over $200 or $300 apps on iOS). But now that I've played with it for a couple of days, I really like Android. I don't think i'll ever switch back to an iPhone. You have more freedom with Android through customization and what not. However, IMO, Android isn't as intuitive as iOS. That's the big learning curve I was referring to.

It's was a tough call to make but I made the switch to my first android device. I've had every single iPhone on launch day since iPhone 3GS (iPhone 3Gs, 4, 4s, 5, &amp; 5s).

I haven't had any problems with coinbase. I've used them for all my purchases so far. I'm a bit biased since I've only used Coinbase for purchases. Another good wallet to look at is Blockchain.info

I have an issue with it, I just made a purchase using the app and I agreed to the purchase for a lower price and it charged me a higher price. It's like it refreshes the price behind the scenes without displaying the updated price to you first. I paid $15 more than I agreed to. Hmmm....

You shouldn't act as a day trader. Please take the time to read into what bitcoin is. It's not a short term investment. It's a long term investment. Day trading without any experience will lead to situations like this. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:08:28
I haven't had any problems with Coinbase purchases so far. (except for my first purchase when I had not been fully verified). My only major gripe with them right now is that sometimes my bitcoin transactions arent posting and they are being returned to me. It's happened about 5 different times with two BTC transfers. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:51:06
You're probably really early to the party. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Don't lose track of the big picture. Spend your bitcoin as much as you can while replenishing what you just spent.

I agree. What I'm saying though is instead of using the sarcasm, could probably just said: "Google it." I think people who are learning about Bitcoin and the exchanges for the first time ought to be greeted with open arms and friendliness so as to not turn them away due to bad experiences dealing with early adopters.

You can do this. But, Mt. Gox has, apparently, having a huge problem with getting your fiat wired back to your account.
