The website is new, spare, and buggy.  If you have any feedback please let me know!  I'm not an expert web designer.
I will add Bitcoin to the Payment Methods section very soon.  It's currently live in-cart.

We're working on getting HTTPS very soon.  All of our Payment options (Paypal and Bitcoin) go through HTTPS via Bitpay and Paypal, so we don't keep any of your financial information.
I apologize for this, and I'll look to make this change very soon.

Bitpay in the Checkout.  It has not been added in the "about us" page as of yet.
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:15:57
It's now in our legal section on our footer.  You can check out all of the details there.

Amazon has given us permission to use Prime for this.
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:44:07
We do have approval from Amazon and we offer 30-day any reason returns.
 - This is what I see in the "about" section.  What do you see?
Please feel free to ask more questions and offer feedback.  I take feedback extremely seriously and I would very much appreciate it.

We don't need to share our address.  Also, Purse goes through 3rd party buyers who may or may not stay in contact after they've updated your Purse order.
You achieve a much more reliable method of getting your discount on Amazon using Gift-Thrift.

If you're familiar with Purse.io's model, you can purchase from them in two different ways.  The first way is to purchase directly from Purse.io with Bitcoin for a 5% discount, and your order is accepted immediately.  If you want a higher discount (6%+) you must place your order in a queue that gets accepted by a 3rd party who wants to liquidate Amazon balance into BTC.  You run the risk as Purse.io isn't entitled to protect your order if the 3rd party scams you, cancels the order, doesn't respond, uses fraud to purchase the item, etc.  Purse.io has systems in place to prevent scams, shipping fraud, etc., however it is still a risk as technology evolves.


One Amazon account, with Prime, making your order happen.  If you need information we can provide screenshots of the account and live updates with your order number and tracking number, similar to Purse.io.  If you don't want to use Bitcoin, you can use Paypal for extra insurance.  We currently offer a 30-day any reason guarantee starting from when you place your order.

If our website is charging sales tax please send the order information to support  We can make changes so that our website doesn't charge sales tax.  We've had this issue in the past and refund the sales tax fees.

Purse does offer steeper discounts, but does require that you go through a single seller.  There are benefits and issues with using this system.
