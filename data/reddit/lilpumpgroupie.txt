Doubtful.  They're probably just going 'Hurr durr... the genius is playing 43d underwater upside down backgammon!  I love my genius president!!!'

Nah, I'm convinced more than anything I'm convinced about in life that he's an unintelligent man.  It doesn't have to be complicated or offensive... because there are a lot of really unintelligent people in the world.
  And I don't just use his words and beliefs, I use the words and beliefs of people who support him... specifically people I know in real life.
Tough shit, man, you'll get over it.

Aren't you criticizing his critics for EXACTLY the same thing that they're criticizing him for?

The best one was how he tried to say a few days ago that people who boycott are losers.

Is there any way to quantify in dollar amount how much they would have profited from that short (if it was one) in the hour or so after the tweet?

I'd bet my life Trump is shorting a bunch of Bitcoin/cryptocurrency shit and then sends this tweet out.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:25:21
Nothing that I haven't done for three years already.  Ignore retarded Trump fans.
AND before you get offended at me saying that, remember:  I'm just speaking my mind.  ARE YOU CENSORING ME??!?!?!

Schrodinger's douchebag

He probably directly is involved in the dip, or profiting from it.  Some kind of short in it.

Because he's almost completely illiterate, and that was a well-composed and coherent tweet.  It's also a an open-secret in DC that he doesn't write all his tweets, and that it's obvious which ones he doesn't write by how well written they are.
