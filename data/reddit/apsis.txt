Insurance is expensive. If you are selling any real volume, you have to assume you will lose a certain percentage of sales (USPS losing packages, scamming buyers, whatever). That percentage is much less than the cost of insurance, which doesn't even cover the latter case. Instead, pocket the money you'd spend on insurance and use it to cover your losses.

*limited* insurance is included with priority mail and express mail. If you ship high value items, and/or ship parcel, media, or first class, insurance costs extra.

If you watch Jeopardy backwards, it's three people paying hundreds of dollars for an old guy to give them dumb answers to their questions until they run out of money and the old guy leaves.

That is saying that the average time between the last block and the next block is 20 minutes. But on average, the last block was 10 minutes ago. So on average, the next block is still 10 minutes from now.
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:05:39
I think what BashCo is getting at is that the \*expected\* time to the next block does not change during the time between blocks: If an hour goes by without a block being mined, that doesn't make it more likely for a block to be mined in the next minute. See "Gambler's Fallacy".
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:25:38
Yes, it is partly explained in comments: This is taking a uniform random time, not a random block. So the random time you select is more likely to occur during a long block.
It's exactly 20 minutes, because the expected time to the next block is 10 minutes (nothing counter-intuitive about this). By the same token, the expected time since the previous block is also 10 minutes. Since these two values are statistically independent, the total time is just the sum 10 + 10 = 20.

What are the consequences for not meeting your goal?
Would you consider selling shares of bitcoin store to make up the last bits?

When Earth and Mars are at their closest to each other, it takes light about 4.5 minutes to make the trip. Since the Mars miner needs to know the previous block to before solving the current one, it would be 9 minutes behind everyone else. Therefore, about 9/10ths of the Mars miner's blocks would arrive late (a little better due to variance of solved block times), so it would essentially be working at 10 times the difficulty of an Earth miner.
So it's possible...sort of.

Bitcoins would be great for kickstarter because they would be able to actually accept your donation immediately (rather than a pledge) and could refund it at very little cost if the project doesn't get fully funded. Also, it would work great for micro-transactions.

Since OP is considering investing his bitcoins in an ASIC, the value of bitcoins is not important. In fact, since an increase in price would be followed by an increase in difficulty, it could make it take longer to recoup his bitcoin investment. So the question is: if you bought an bfl miner now for 11 BTC, would you be able to mine &gt;11 BTC with it?

Why would the website owner do that? He makes 50% profit of whatever the gem is worth, so he'd be loosing money to do that.

yup $1500*600 = $0.9 Million. Quite a large potential buy order.

There are several ways of doing it. One way is the casino can announce a hashed (encrypted) version of a randomly chosen number (using appropriate buffering if the numbers needed are always small, so the same hash never comes up twice) The player can then send their own random number to the casino to make sure the casino really did pick a random number. The casino and player numbers are added, and used for the seed in a known deck-shuffling algorithm (or whatever the game needs) The player plays the game, and then the unhashed number the casino chose is revealed, and the player can check it hashes to what the casino originally stated.

PLN and USD values fluctuate independently, so this number is really meaningless to anyone who doesn't transact in PLN (vast majority of the world). The USD rate significant to more people because more people use USD.
What would be more universal would be the gold/btc rate. On June 9th, 2011, gold was worth [$1,537.75/oz](  = 48.19 BTC/oz at 31.9099 USD/BTC. (This number may be slightly off, since I used the closing price of gold (not sure how to find the price precisely when the high trade of 2011 was made)
Gold was worth $1605/oz when the recent high trade occurred on mtgox (33.2 USD/BTC), making gold at that moment 48.34 BTC/oz. If I used the closing price again $1595.7/oz, it would be 48.06 BTC/oz.
TL;DR recent gold/BTC high was extremely close to previous high.

people like numbers that are of the form
5^n * 2^m * x
Where 
x &lt; 4
0 &lt; n - m &lt; 2
x, n, m non-negative integers.

If the miners keep a copy of the block chain, shouldn't they be able to detect an "evil block" sent by the pool? I'm not sure if any mining software exists to do this, but I don't see why it wouldn't be possible.

Except it's linear growth instead of exponential, so it will take longer before people realize its a bad idea.

This sounds good, but I'm a little confused how it would work. People make transactions that will go through only if the project is funded, but Kickstarter decides if a project is funded. So how would this not require trust in Kickstarter?

I like my thinkpad keyboard, it has a nice responsive "click" to it. It's not as good as a desktop keyboard, but I find it far superior to any other laptop keyboard I've tried. (I'm sure part of that is simple being used to it). I also like being able to take it apart completely and put it back together.

Ok, a little irked by this - after going through the checkout, I come to the last page and see there is another 10% added onto the order cost. If you have a flat percentage fee added to every order, it should be included in the price of the item, not a surprise at the end. (note: This does combine multiplicatively with the 10% off coupon handed out here, for a net 1% off listed price)

Right, that's what I thought. So someone could wrote a miner that checks a local copy of the blockchain against the pool's blocks. If any mining pool (or coalition of pools) decides to be malicious, the miners in that pool automatically switch to another pool before the blockchain is forked.

It's all a matter of probability. It's like rolling a die until you get a 1, except this die has 15 quadrillion sides. Rolling it 15 quadrillion times doesn't mean you will roll a 1. You might be lucky and roll a 1 much sooner, or you might be unlucky and have to try 100 quadrillion times. Slush's pool at 3345 GH/s (3.3 trillion "rolls" per second) has an expected solve time of about 80 minutes, however since this is only a probability, also has a huge expected variance over many solves. Note that the previous block only took 7 minutes.

well, it can't ever be worth more than 21M. Since it increases in value by 10% each time, that's only 143 more purchases away (25.09 * (1.1^143 ) = 20828339). Realistically though, it won't get anywhere close to that.

The more computing power devoted to mining, the more secure bitcoin is, and therefore the more valuable bitcoin is (I don't mean the exchange rate, but these two are closely tied).
So no, it's not a prisoner's dilemma.
