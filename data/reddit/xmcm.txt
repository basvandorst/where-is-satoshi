1.) Can't say anything about that. 
2.) Ether Difficulty is increasing the same as it is with bitcoins and there is basically a limited supply cause it will be so difficult to mine that there is a sort of a soft cap to it. Check out here for bitcoin: 
3.) Ethers usual usecase should be gas but money has value cause people think it has value not cause there are numbers printed on it. You could use everything as a currency and this is happening with ETH since there are no real dApps that run in the moment so using it as gas is still some time ahead when the general public would use the blockchain apps. 
4.) Almost all ICOs accept bitcoin as well as ether. 
5.) The puplic is not developing apps they are using the apps. You dont need to know how to code when you want to use software do you? And the loss is on the developer this is all very new and prone to mistakes. The blockchain was never a part of all this problems. It is all on the developers who are just starting to use this. 
6.) Basically same as the end of point 5. All this thefts are not on faults of the blockchain. It is bugs in code. It's like you would say there is only a online drug market and assasinations because of bitcoin. Thats just a narrow point of view. 
7.) You have two third points :)

By a smart contract that runs on a blockchain. This will be the future with ethereum. If you are also interested in other blockchain technology go check it out. I am investing in ETH and Bitcoin now and it worked out great for me until now and i really think there is a wide use spectrum for it. And since it is basically no currency there isnt really any rivality between the two. You can see it as a kind of fuel for the contracts on the blockchain.

That is pretty normal cause BTC exists since 2009 and as far as i know and ETH since 2013.

You don't need to know when it is sent you hold the money in the smart contract and as a buyer and you give the money to the sender once you validated the package. If the package is damaged you can send it back and cancel the order which gets validated by the seller when he gets the package back.

I mean as a buyer you always want to have a fuctioning product and your money spent on it and as a seller you want to get rid of the product and get the money so you would guess both parties want to agree and send/recieve the money but like i said this is the part where i call myself out. The money would be locked to the contract and not accessible from both sides if either one is claiming a fraud that didn't actually happen. I am no expert in this field but if you want to know more about it i am sure you will find something. It is widely used in the darknet exchanges for buying drugs and guns and whatever in huge ammounts and it is working fine there (i think this is the best example for a untrusted seller/criminal from the darknet). There are real companies who do escrow too.

Sure and it will stay like this as long as humans brains can have an api to a computer. You can still do inputs

Are you trying to conversate here or are you just trolling. Cause what you just said doesn't even make sense. Just cause you can't grasp it doesn't mean it does not exist.

You can NOT do this with traditional money without setting up a contract with a lawyer where both parties need to be present and someone who holds the money in the meantime. If you could meet up why wouldnt you just check the coin when you meet the other person?? We were talking about spending 100.000$ online without a 3rd party to trust and if you read my example i wrote two parents above or something i brought up an example there.

You need to validate it to the contract that you received the package and you can check if it is sealed before validating it. There is nothing that can validate this other then a person. I don't get your argument sorry. You talked about safely transferring the 100k$ and you could do that with a smart contract.

Sure they are increasing in different ammounts and are not tied to each other but it works in the same way. Bad phrasing from me there

Ok lets say Ben (Buyer) wants to buy something from Sam (Seller). 
Ben sends the ammount of money to the smart contract. The money gets hold on the contract and Sam sees that the money arrived on the contract. Now Sam sends the package out to Ben. When Ben gets the package and it is not damaged or is not empty or whatever Ben confirms the arrival and the money goes out to Sam. If Ben holds the prduct and doesn't trigger it he won't get his money back from the contract. In order to get his money back from the contract he needs to send the package back to Sam who only can send back the ammount of money not claim it himself. This way the money would stay on the contract and noone would be able to redeem the money. This is the problem i can't seem to solve. Since you could make people pay to the contract to make the ammount disappear but for both sides. But you would not be able to scam people this way. Either Ben would get his product back and no money cause it is on the smart contract. Or the person has the product and paid for it or doesn't have it but Sam also doesn't get money from it. And this way there is no incentive to do it.

Russian uses an own blockchain built on the ethereum blockchain. It is not using the main chain. And yes ethereum is another world but it is can be still used as a currency and is already. And bitcoin hits its end at about 2020. There won't be any more coins entering the market and the price will sometime stabilize most likely. Same will happen with ether sometime.

Without a third party to trust which in this case would be paypal. And paypal is partnered up with escrow.com which usually has 10% fees on the escrow service.
