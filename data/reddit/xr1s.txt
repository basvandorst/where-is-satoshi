Very poorly written/worded. As an early adopter/miner/investor and ancap with an appreciation for both Austrian economics as well as the crytoanarchistic/cypherpunk origins of bitcoin, I view this wording as attempting to fold bitcoin into status quo political ethos along with the marginalization of libertarianism in general. Many if not most of the bitcoin proponents I know are non-"crazy" libertarians. If you want to criticize libertarianism, fine. If you want to criticize the origins of bitcoin, fine. But please at least read more about the fucking origin of bitcoin.
"I think that the obsession in the bitcoin community with bringing down central banks, fiat currencies, and governements is misguided and generally misses the point of bitcoin"
Who the fuck are you to tell us the point of bitcoin?
Undermining the status quo financial system qua state apparatuses, is overtly why bitcoin was created. If you want to criticize this, fine, but please don't insult the community by contending falsehoods regarding its creation.
"It couldn't be stupider, and that's why it's brilliant."

@_date: 2014-03-15 22:46:43
Totally agree with you re leveling the playing field. Mainly derived from lack of centralized monetary control, the promise of possible bona-fide anonymity (zerocoin, etc.), the difficulty with which taxes would be collected, and all the other fun things getting started and in the pipeline (multisig, open transactions, etc.). Conceivably, tools like bitcoin could make it much more difficult, maybe impossible someday, for the state and crony capitalists like Buffet to steal peoples' money in the form of taxpayer bailouts to e.g. shitty banks.

The worst thing about this is that, unless I'm missing something, *all* the devices would be running the same software from a single company. If run like that, this would only serve to harm the community by actually *centralizing* miner decision-making. If I did not miss something and this is what is being proposed, FUCK THAT.

The whole point of bitcoin is that it's not regulated. It is profoundly difficult to regulate. Most core users would not participate if there were attempts at regulation. If they are successful at implementing regulations, we will move on to something that is harder or impossible to regulate.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:51:20
Valid point. However, the more open alternatives to the exchanges pale in comparison to the open alternatives to *wallets*. Most of us here recommend that no one uses coinbase, the other exchanges, or any of the closed source wallets for *storage*. If we feel it pragmatically necessary to use the closed source services like coinbase, it is advisable to remove coins from any webwallets ASAP, as historically they are much more readily compromised.
Multibit is very easy to use, afaik works on win8, and is open source. Given the comparative risks, why recommend closed source apps?

So purevpn eventually refunded me 0.0077 of the 0.0078 coins I sent. I don't think their problems with btc are related to them being malicious, but rather very disorganized. I took over a week from the date I requested a refund to receiving it. I also do not believe I would have received the refund if it were not for the community ire that developed regarding their request for additional ID.
A bitpay employee (dreyzehner) also contacted me on reddit asking to help. He stated that he could not find the email I sent (perhaps spam filters on their end). If it wasn't for him I would have had a much more negative impression of bitpay (i.e. if I weren't on reddit). It's great employees like this work to help customers on sites like this, and I think he would have helped me with a refund had bitpay not followed through.

Of course I'm bothered by it. I just won't choose the lesser of two evils in the form of digital direct democracy or status quo political elections.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:36:30
Your response is not coherent. Indeed I was stating that natural law and direct democracy do not necessarily have anything to do with each other. All of your objections apply to your direct democracy.
The founding documents of the United States were in no small part derived from the notion that citizens should have inalienable rights--that is rights that cannot be voted away with political power (obviously this ideology has not persisted in power)--and the respect of these is in part derived from social respect of them.
I have no desire to be a part of a tyrannical society, nor take any benefits from it. I, and many others, are willing to employ violence as a last resort against anyone, no matter the votes, who threaten violence against us (i.e. attempt physically enforcing laws we will not comply with). Your collective beliefs that everyone will be complicit with your votes is more of a social construct than doctrines on natural rights.

Thankfully we have projects like coinvalidation and cryptolocker to make sure the slaves keep their shackles on.

I'm going on interviews for medical residencies and whenever they ask about bitcoin (which I mentioned in my application), I always focus on what you just wrote: protection against tyranny, be it e.g. Cyprus bank account garnishing, donations to Falun Gong amongst oppression in China, potential domestic inflation production in USA, and assistance of journalist heroes like Snowden.

Holy fuck balls. I thought the foundation would help promote the FREEDOM and PRIVACY aspects of the currency, a la the cypherpunk and cryptoanarchist visions. These are apparently a subgroup of pro-regulation statists within the foundation.
Joel Dalais:
I would be quite interested in sitting on the committee[...]Personally, I believe in regulation and taxation, though in the knowledge that privacy/anonymous transactions can still be attained regardless of any regulation and that its a necessary evolutionary step for Bitcoin that will happen regardless, but I'd much prefer that we had positive influence as and when this does happen. I do believe in some safeguards and assisting the relevant authorities when needed. Some crimes are just too wrong to be ignored."
Stephen Sunderlin:
For the Record I too support regulation as it relates the interfacing of Fiat and bitcoin.[...]I also support taxation with the understand the we are also free in the US to choose to donate our funds to non-profit organizations to have more control over how are tax dollars are spent.
Charles Evans:
"Often lost on people is that 'regulation' does not necessarily imply a bureaucrat in every living room.  The education campaign needs to be in both directions; in addition to briefing regulators, staffers, and key committee members, we should get the message out to cryptocurrency users that regulation can be as mild as zoning, building codes, health inspectors for restaurants, etc.  Regulation is all around us, and it isn't all bad."

Totally different. *In theory* with your bank accounts you have FDIC insurance up to a certain point. Most credit card companies will refund fraudulent transactions. Someone steals your coins, your SOL.
When you're using bitcoins, you're making a choice. You're deciding to participate in an amazing new experiment, and not paying all the otherwise-forced insurance premiums associated with the banking and credit card oligopolies. When people take more responsibility of their money with the way bitcoin works now, they assume more risk. This risk is amplified by using closed-source applications. It's conceivable that later more services will appear that take a premium and provide the same FDIC-ish (or probably better) insurance for bitcoin-related projects that will obviate the concern over closed source applications, but afaik that time has not come yet. Thus, at the moment, I still contend that endorsing these closed source wallets is going to contribute to a lot of people freaking out when their coins are stolen through shady wallet devs or security exploits.

You could just define that as per the quotes above.
*Any* regulation is in direction opposition to what bitcoin was created for: market commerce independent of state intervention. Involving the state with regulation is sowing the seeds of bitcoin's de facto destruction, to the extent it is successful (which I don't believe it will be).
Bitcoin is not great because it can fucking compete with western union, as many of the pro-regulators seem to think. It is great because it has the potential to usurp the status quo world currency system, to the betterment of all individuals except politicians and state bureaucrats.
