Update flash/java? I can't remember which one it uses.
@_date: 2012-02-06 04:25:56
Did you make that?

My only question is it a BITter Beer?

Have any of you people ever created a professional magazine, or know about issues you would run into that would create delays? 
On that note, Matthew how far along is magazine and what is left? 
@_date: 2012-05-18 19:28:25
so what's the alternatives?
@_date: 2012-05-09 04:15:45
I LoL'd 
@_date: 2012-09-20 18:57:54
check website for your prepaid card, often you can use the direct deposit information to get signed up for an exchange. It's what I do. 
@_date: 2012-01-31 10:28:08
I think it was problems with video lag. 
@_date: 2012-01-28 01:14:06
Well I figured some people such as my self can't get bank accounts due to bad credit, and this would be helpful 
@_date: 2012-05-18 21:33:09
Yea, not good for someone who needs cash though. 
@_date: 2012-08-20 10:50:06
6 hours and no emails? I'll just take it. 
@_date: 2012-02-03 11:53:19
I challenge some one to give a tl:dr on that. 
@_date: 2012-04-05 21:48:36
I have followed forum post a little bit from what I understand this is Matthew's first ever attempt at a magazine, maybe he got over his head, but I do not think he is a scammer or trying to be the next "Bruge Wagner" 
@_date: 2012-01-30 12:07:34
Are you in the US? There is no credit check for this, just go to walmartmoneycard.com and click get a card. When it arrives follow my directions.
@_date: 2012-01-28 05:05:36
I just posted this today,   might be helpful to you 
@_date: 2012-03-01 23:40:55
Let's promote the ban of an "illegal currency" so they can move on to us next, great idea. 
:edit: I can't read
@_date: 2012-01-28 06:39:15
Could you please explain what is "so dumb" about it?
@_date: 2012-04-07 03:12:41
Go to bed, Matthew 
@_date: 2012-12-02 00:06:10
Would love to see how the mobile app works but I am "bitpoor" 
@_date: 2012-01-27 19:39:28
Worth a shot I have used Visa's in the past, not sure if my accountnow did't work because of accountnow or because it was a visa. 
@_date: 2012-01-16 01:33:01
if this is your site how about a promo code for us redditors?
@_date: 2012-01-27 17:47:05
I'm in the same boat so I know the pain. 
@_date: 2012-03-16 21:36:59
They may do a "sweet 16" pool on monday so be on the look out. 
@_date: 2012-01-30 23:49:31
I agree, but at least we got a way to use bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2012-01-27 17:46:50
They are linked to a "virtual" bank account for the purpose of getting direct deposit through jobs, but you can use the direct deposit information as you like, the only information I needed to get the cards where Name address and SS#
@_date: 2012-01-28 06:38:45
I'm not out side the US but I imagine if you have pre paid cards with direct deposit available it should work. Most prepaid cards you can sign up for online and don't cost anything I would say it's worth a shot. 
@_date: 2012-01-28 07:56:03
Yep :) also if you do $1000 a month in direct deposits the fees are waived, and for ATM's if I have time I usually just get a pack of gum and ask for cash back, knocks down the ATM fee to about 50 cents and I get fresh breath 
@_date: 2012-05-18 00:00:46
Sorry I was unaware, I was just relying the information I was told when I asked about new polices that would effect Bitcoin transactions
@_date: 2012-08-20 10:11:12
couldn't get the faucet to work on your site 1FySJHj67ZRyAbjQBhpyEuMWTHqe56tfto

"where we don't know how many tickets are sold or what the odds of winning are."   This is usually how raffles work you never know how many will enter till the tickets are done being sold. Would it make you feel better if the thread had updates of how many tickets HAVE currently been sold?
 
@_date: 2012-10-08 21:31:47
I skype with the owner of Strike every now and then, they are pretty good at staying on top of VPN's and other back doors to access their site from the US. 
@_date: 2012-04-07 00:39:33
sheffield or chesterfield, is where he said he will be shipping from, skype is preferred method of contact: vladimir.marchenko.co.uk

For odd colors at start up click Uniball Config&gt; Change your resolution to match your PC&gt; Where it says Patch click Properties&gt; Uncheck all boxes except "Hide BackGround"
@_date: 2012-04-07 03:15:47
It will be ok. 
@_date: 2011-07-31 00:56:47
hey Towlie!! (oculus) Guys it's a fun game easy way to earn some bitcoins if you are good at bankroll management. 
@_date: 2011-08-28 04:01:35
Pretty sure you are just an affiliate of moonco.in and betco.in and mad cause I made a comment about a superior poker client to betco.in, in your little thread. 
@_date: 2011-06-14 19:55:11
i tried a couple seems like most of them are down want to help me compile a list of working faucets?
@_date: 2011-10-18 23:39:01
What will this do to the price? If people aren't mining there will be no new bitcoins being produced, so demand for what is available will raise? Any one care to speculate on that?
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:24:07
I didn't just ask for donations, I also asked if there was task or a why I could earn bit coins online with a small investment, I thought maybe there was a more practical or quicker way than faucets. 
@_date: 2011-11-22 18:17:39
 is a poker site that deals only in bitcoins I play there and am a fan. 
@_date: 2011-07-23 10:10:50
I see all the downvotes, I would just like to add i wasnt spamming, I am an active redditor. 
@_date: 2011-12-06 13:07:34
Just an fyi you can use prepaid cards to sign up for merchants such as dwolla thus being able to get bitcoins from exchange sites and not having to pay a surcharge. To do this on your card there will be a website, go to the website and figure out what you need to log in, after you log in if you search a little you will find information to give an employer for direct deposit use this direct deposit info as your bank information to sign up for dwolla. I have tested this on numerous cards and if any one wants I will order a specific prepaid card to see if it also works for that one but I can verify this works for advance america prepaid cards, both visa and mastercard greendot, rush cards and I have also tried a few others. 
@_date: 2011-06-14 11:30:37
hey it's worth a shot even if someone just wants to send .01 btc. 
never hurts to ask 
@_date: 2011-07-19 23:52:22
I'm in and registered for the free roll do they have a certain starting time or just when they fill up?
@_date: 2011-08-27 04:36:05
If you are playing on betco.in I would really recommend btcontilt.com lot smoother interface and alot more table action. If you sign up you can use my affiliate, midixiewreck (using it will allow us both to get rake) 
@_date: 2011-06-18 11:35:25
There are problems cashing out, or so many people are cashing out right now it's lowering the market?

im on a windows pc how do i add the -testnet flag?
@_date: 2011-10-31 11:10:02
Thanks for the Link, I will def check this out. 
@_date: 2011-10-15 09:58:20
maybe we should discuss this outside of where people who don't know about bitcoin can hear about it 
@_date: 2011-10-18 23:55:56
Wtf this site is a copy and uses the same client as btcontilt.com, and come to think of it, btcontilt started getting ddos'd when your site came out, care to comment?
@_date: 2011-08-03 11:57:17
hey check out btcontilt.com it's a simple client but rocks in comparison to betco.in BS

How hard is it to plate things in gold? I'm going to start gold plating EVERYTHING!
@_date: 2011-10-31 16:09:34
haha not sure why got down voted, must have an enemy on reddit. 
@_date: 2011-08-03 11:58:37
What bullshit, player was playing in a way that can piss people off but in no way was he doing anything to be a bannable offense.
@_date: 2011-12-03 09:47:58
Good site, and great customer service! 
@_date: 2011-06-14 12:14:13
maybe instead of being cynical and a douche you could point me towards a subreddit more likely to help me out?
@_date: 2011-08-30 22:46:37
oh I also like btcontilt.com better cause losers like you don't play there, thanks for the reminder. 
@_date: 2011-06-18 11:38:07
No upvotes and 4 down votes as of now? I am fine with the down votes but please take the time to explain the down votes, I made an educated guess going on what I know and am seeing about bitcoins, please educate me not just downvote and leave if you feel other wise. 
@_date: 2011-11-14 23:13:08
there could be mini games with in the game that players could bet and compete against each other for bitcoins on.The house would get a small percentage of these "bets" for development cost and to distribute among enemies in the game. 
@_date: 2011-12-21 12:30:27
I would like to personally apologize for ever promoting this site in As a poker player and a bitcoin enthusiast I saw potential in this site and thought it would do well, but the site owner has choose to let it sit and collect dust.  Last I saw him I told him that people had many questions and offered to be a mediator between here and him to answer any questions people may have.  He agreed that was a good idea than went AWOL. 
@_date: 2011-08-24 13:03:33
what do you need bitcoins for?
@_date: 2011-09-17 07:47:49
Can some one explain to me what a 51% attack is? I have been hearing it mentioned a lot lately.

Actually the small profit you seem to think i make, I would be making the same profit the person the uses my affiliate would make, all it does is opens up rake. 
@_date: 2011-10-11 05:15:04
@_date: 2011-07-19 23:47:22
what kind of upfront payment are we talking about? I am working on getting backers together. 
@_date: 2011-06-14 12:23:05
I looked at bit market, and found bitgigs.com im going to check around on there and see if i cant find anything 
@_date: 2011-12-02 02:36:41
dwolla is just as east to sign up for as paypal (same steps actually) just do it and than most exchanges accept dwolla
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:28:18
You have really good prices expect an order soon. How new is your site as I noticed you don't have a very extensive product line, any chance of expanding it? 
@_date: 2013-02-12 23:21:04
As some one who works in a restaurant I would love this. My co-workers, not as much..
@_date: 2013-01-29 21:34:48
Seals with clubs is great site (got a chance to talk with Bryan Micon a bit, good peoples). Also it's good to see people over at are finally starting to accept bitcoin.
