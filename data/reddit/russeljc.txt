A proposal similar to the OP would be far more preferable in my mind. However...
The larger question of whether socialized losses (bail-ins) are an acceptable way for an exchange to recover is at stake. Such a question is one that is important to large players within the Bitcoin sphere. Unfortunately, I expect the resolution to this to be drawn out and bloody.

The taller and more slender form fits the magician archetype. The more zoomed out view allow one to see the magician has effortless mastery of his surroundings.
The other two look more brutish in comparison.
For gender, my answer is probably invalid, as it is **both**.  As a gamer, I prefer the choice. From a creativity standpoint, you get more mileage from each idea.
Provided both genders are covered elsewhere relatively equally, I would choose a male figure for this particular style of sketch.
I would imagine a female character demonstrating her mastery in a different way than this sketch's environment would allow.

I think the above suggestion is progress, a good idea, and likely to get us moving to a solution.
What if the protocol used the majority-voted size? The upgrade could increase the base size to buy us the time. Miners would contribute 1 satoshi to their 'right size' with each transaction. (They set this setting once and it is applied to all their operations.)
The protocol creates new blocks based on the votes. (It could just as well be a weighted average, with outlier removal.)
The idea of a controlled increase is good.
Ensuring safety in the corner cases is essential.
I'm trying to think of a way to embed the possibility or option of future flexibility, i.e. not having to require a future hard fork.

Numbers are universal.
A preferences setting with a sliding bar. To oversimplify, it goes from 1 to 100 right now. If you want 12 MB block sizes, you set it to 12. Your vote counts along with everyone else's, they are weighted.
If the wallet has a language pack for other settings, adding another is not a problem. If the wallet has no language support, then adding a setting with no language is just perpetuating an existing problem.

bobabouey linked to some of the OTC rules in this thread: 
At this instant the GBTC page and my Ameritrade Level II stream does not show the Asks that I have in place. Bloomberg feeds do. Orders &gt; 100 shares appear more reliably, if I understood things correctly.

As the debate has evolved, it feels to me like we are arriving on a logically 'provable' best solution. Maybe there's a flaw in my thinking.  Unless we are electing to continue searching for new solutions before taking any first steps.
One approach has future effects if/unless changed, with those effects being unknown.
One approach has no future effects.
By using the latter approach, we limit risk relative to the other solution.
Risks attributed to increasing block size fall into two camps.
The first set of risks apply to the 20MB size increase are legitimate, but also apply at the current block size of 1MB.
The second set of risks speak to what MIGHT happen, were subsequent size increases to be imposed.
The rationale for the second set of arguments is precisely why we should be making a single, limited change. We can learn from those implications in a real world environment. We will also buy ourselves additional time to try to find consensus on a long term solution.

So long as nobody else comes forward having had the same experience, collectively with 13 or more shares, it is probably a safe assumption that a filter would account for the historical omission.
It doesn't explain why Asks for 1 share did appear on the Ask side on GBTC's view ( nor in my Ameritrade Level II quote data, while concurrently appearing in a bloomberg feed.

There are a million ways it could go. You just have to place your bets and be at peace with them.
I think the combined LTC / Doge community is an unstoppable force. I think Monero provides some real innovations.  I hate this, but I think Ripple will go up a lot from its current price.
I don't think that is the most important question, though. I think the more important question is, in what capacity will these cryptos co-exist?
-Bitcoin comes out.
-Litecoin comes out.
-The notion of cloning is born, and inevitably an unsustainable number of cryptos emerge.
I believe markets move to efficiency. When a natural market event (someone deciding to form a new crypto, which is generally in their best interest) can cause harm to a market...I believe the market will find a way to remove that harm. Markets move to efficiency.
One way that could happen is through a convergence. A realization "there can be only one", and everything moves into Bitcoin.
This was the first thought the bitcoin community grappled with. It was a binary decision. There will be one coin, or there will be many.
Then some legitimate 2.0 coins started showing up.
The value of having 'side experiments' was very clear. Market valuations indicated the perceived value of those experiments. But invariably, the self-diluting nature of having various cryptos competing directly against themselves caught up, and new cryptos need, in general, to have something legitimately valuable about them to have staying power and value.
When Counterparty, Mastercoin came along, a new possible was conceived of. One where a single umbrella holds all crypto, which is then divided into separated assets.
The past few months, there has been a raging debate about whether sidechains risk systemically destroying bitcoin, or being its future.
I want to be very clear. I am not as educated about the nuances of the implementation as many that debate this far more often than I. I'd refer anyone to cypherdoc's 'Gold Collapsing. Bitcoin UP' thread:  if they want to explore this more deeply.
We're nearly at the end now...
Microsoft's head of corporate strategy allegedly made this prognositcation - a future with 6 digital currencies: "USD, Euro, Yen, Pound, Renminbi, and Bitcoin."
I think the market will move to this. You can invest and exchange between each of these various baskets based on your own risk and hedging appetite. The exchange will be the same as we view moving from Bitcoin to Litecoin right now.
Whether the 'Bitcoin' of those 6 currencies will contain sidechains for the various specialized uses of Bitcoin remains to be seen. I am not an expert in the field, but my expectation is that is the direction we will head, because the market will demand it.

I transferred 20% of my small trading account from BTC to LTC after reading this. A mining chip with a 130% LTC advantage, intended for the masses. It is exactly what the LTC market needs - an injection of fresh blood.
They have an amazingly strong community after combining with Doge. They are, among other things, the "Plan B" if something catastrophic were to go wrong with bitcoin. And it's BTC/LTC ratio has never been lower. I had viewed it as being in a now or never situation.
This chip news nudged the now scenario up above the never scenario enough for me to be willing to throw a small amount of speculative funds back at it again.

Markets always find equilibrium. Opportunity exists when gaps exist between them.
In my mind, the market must valuate two things:
1) How much of a premium exists for the added protection and security, both real and perceived, through investing in Bitcoin within the existing stock/share system?
2) How much additional demand will come into the bitcoin sphere by providing a first investment vehicle for which this group of people is comfortable? 
My own personal experiences, talking with people of various risk tolerances since 2011 re: bitcoin, is that this represents a massive segment of market share.
If someone is already comfortable with the notion of buying stocks, the idea of buying a stock backed by the value of bitcoin is not intimidating. They can do what they already know, and have bitcoin. They do not need to worry about storing it safely. 
We early adopters don't think of these things as barriers.
But for the next wave of adoption, these problems cannot exist.
I have long believed - speculated - that this event is THE catalyst which will bring the next order of magnitude both in users and financial backing, to the bitcoin world.
That is just my speculative assessment. It could be wrong. But it weighs into my long term selling plan.
Circling back to GBTC, I see three distinct phases.
1) Rift - two prices out of phase, price discovery not yet occurred.
2) Equilibrium reached, market effect indicates clear direction.
3) Rally (or crash) ensues once 2) becomes clear.
Today was very, very much step 1).
The entire thing happened because there was no liquidity.
762 shares sold today. 76 Bitcoin. That is not real volume.
As I said above, my primary motivation was to accelerate market price discovery. I didn't expect it to play out the way it did. Now, people will have a night to chew on this before making their real bids.
Today was just testing the water.
No real volume traded.
I know there are people waiting to make their big 401k or Roth buys.  They are waiting to see where the price lands, whether to be patient, or rush in.
Tomorrow (5/5), I anticipate an increase both in the number of bids, number of asks, and net volume.  I also expect the price gap to narrow significantly.
The key thing to watch in my book is Maxim's 50,000 Ask at $35.00. That still represents a 46% premium over market.
Tomorrow, I speculate:
33% - the 50k Ask remains unchanged, no new 50k Asks appear.
-25% - the 50k Ask fills.
-25% - a 50k Ask appears at a price between &gt;1 and 2x the $35 ask.
-17% - a 50k Ask appears greater than 2x above the $35 ask.
I personally speculate we'll find equilibrium above the current market price, but very likely below this ATH.  Moving into 2), this will cause a net upward effect on price that will let us test the long term resistance line around $300.  Once that breaks with confirmation, the rally can take care of itself.
As for how long...very soon or very far away :-)
This event is one of several 'jolts' to the market which give it a chance to rally. We hit bitcoin with a defibrillator.  Whether it responds is up to the collective market participants. 
If the event does not cause a rally, then I expect the TA-predicted downtrend outcome to become more likely. That typically prognositcates a bear market that could continue through the summer.
Tomorrow will be a very interesting day.
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:04:25
Equilibrium does not necessitate equal prices. It means that whatever relative premium exists becomes stable.
For example, BTC $240, GBTC $600.
Or 240/240. Or 600/240.
The relative values don't matter for stability, just that the ratio becomes more stable than it is now.

This is why I stay out of this particular debate in general. There are nuances being discussed which I am not aware of. I thought it was a safe play adding Satoshi's commentary.
Wouldn't it be true that, even with your proposal, the same problem exists? It seems to me we are merely redefining the 'trigger' scenario. 
In one case, it flatly and universally is applied at some point in time. Satoshi's recommendation allows adoption time to pass.
In the other case, the change is applied the first instant some majority uses the new approach (? assumption based on what you wrote above).
In the latter case, the trigger moves to the point in time that a majority adopt. At that point, it is still a hard fork, the same implications exist. 
In my view, the latter solution provides more contention and risk than the former.
I fully acknowledge that in this discussion, I know much less than many others (I will again cite cypherdoc's Bitcointalk thread as a great focus point for this discussion). So in all honesty - is there something I am missing?
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:15:43
1) Leave code as is. 
2) Apply 20MB limit, buying ourselves well over a year more time to continue to evaluate options, including those we have not yet thought of.
1) projects a failure scenario within a year (could be much sooner), 2) has demonstrated itself to be safe.
Billions of dollars of Wall Street and investment money is not going to flow into an open-sourced cryptocurrency that can't solve its own problems.
We need to prove that open-sourced, group-based refinements and improvements can be safely made.

Here's a link to the reddit writeup I made detailing the 17 shares of GBTC sold at $1337/BTC, or $133.7 per share:
Since the thread has begun, we've gotten a bit more data that might help explain the disparity on the historical price data - outlier filtering. Another contributor noted that there was a gap of 29 shares between those shown on the graph and the total shares sold for the day. I account for 17 of those shares.
We're still trying to figure out the weirdness about orders showing up in some feeds but not others.
All told, I would say it was a very successful first day for $GBTC, and I am thrilled to have been able to be a part of it.

Something procedural to consider as we discuss incorporating the fix to the capacity cliff. I forget who said it, I heard he was pretty smart ;-)
"It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."

EDIT: I just saw the SS, capturing the sale at $175/share as it happened. It would be great if the lucky seller was able to come forward to confirm. I'll link to your thread here:
Text before seeing the new thread:
Well, that was the highest Ask at one time. But we have not had anybody confirm their sale.
We further suspect that 733 of the 762 shares sold were within the 37.98 to 42.00 range, with mine accounting for 17 of the remaining 29 'outlier shares'.
It is possible, if someone else reports their sales of the remaining 12 shares, that the amount was higher than the $1337. 
Right now, because of the presumed filtering, we can't know for certain.
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:34:23
That is true of all solutions which require a code change.
General consensus seems to be shifting towards acknowledging that as a beneficial step, so long as we do not overcommit and doom ourselves. The proposed change is a single increase, which will allow for us to learn from its impact before making any further potential changes. 
Changes which defined a programatically scalable solution which could, given the right scenario, spell the doom of Bitcoin, has been averted.
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:25:30
I was so sure I had it at $1337.
But I see this SS is not only higher, but also taken 1 1/2 hours before mine. Thanks for the SS!
There were still 12 shares unaccounted for between net shares sold, the 29 unaccounted for, minus my 17.
I bet this was a 12 share sale.
I really hope the lucky seller comes forward!

Well said, and absolutely true.
I think it'd be tough to get consensus on what does and doesn't qualify for a market buy.
Is a coin bought on an exchange which provides proof of funds representative of more than a coin bought on an exchange which does not?
MtGox showed us the market priced in that confidence into the price.
What about OTC sales, or localbitcoins?
I know there will be a lot of visibility on GBTC as one of several indicators of Bitcoin's value.  The value is a loose approximation of the BTC assets held within the trust, with value-add for the perceived and real additional compliance security, protection of funds, and a larger potential market participation.
Once equilibrium is reached, I do anticipate there will be a premium attached to GBTC above and beyond spot. How much, I cannot guess.

People keep assuming that. 
I'm purely in the second possible camp of those selling:
I bought some shares from my self-directed Ameritrade Roth IRA with USD I had in my account. I later sold some of those shares.
There are rules about the number of day trades you can perform within a rolling day period, everyone has to consider their own investment position.
This liquidity pinch will only ease when existing BIT holders are compelled to sell.
Until then, the market is razor thin, with many buys and sells show up neither in price history nor on Level II quote streams.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:13:50
The few trades I have done have been manual, active trades. Each has cost me $9.99.
I don't typically move into and out of stocks quickly within my Roth.
The GBTC is an exception in that regard, and for the short term volatility, the trading fee is not significant.
A Buy 100 at $42, Sell 17 at $133.7, 70 more about $65, the rest at $50. Then a round trip loss from 55 to 50, counting as 1 of my 5 day trades which are allowed for non-day-traders within a rolling calendar period.
Both volume and liquidity are now up with the range narrowed to within $1.
Next week will be a different market than the first week.

-Lack of flexibility or options in auction offering.
-Doubt the premium would be paid.
Demand has risen. The market has 'learned' that auction-offered coins will be bought.
If memory serves, one leaked auction revealed close-to (slightly below?) market prices, with the rest commanding a premium.
This is the last known large offering, save for the MtGox/Bitcoinica distribution coming through Kraken in September. At that point, their exchange will allow for leveraging long, so the question remains whether that distribution will have a net positive or negative effect.
I think it is entirely possible to see the final round of coins go for such a premium.
I don't consider it the most likely outcome, but it is certainly a possibility.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:25:34
There is some merit to this.
I was just thinking today about this dilemma.
Satoshi has the problem that he needs to remain disconnected from the problem.
Yet in the past he has demonstrated that in crises, he has shown a willingness to clarify:
**"I am not Dorian Nakamoto." - Satoshi Nakamoto**
We have a similar situation here.
At least part of the debate seems to rely on a lack of absolute clarity about Satoshi's *future* intentions.
It is possible his intention was to not define it.
It is possible he did not think of it.
It is possible he had a specific idea which he was not able to communicate or convey before he went silent.
If it is the latter, I believe the bitcoin community would appreciate that guidance being communicated.
I speculate the major risk in his mind is to avoid setting any sort of precedent or expectation for future guidance.
Think of it like a canary clause.
The community could pose a formal request.  The request to comment, only if it had been his original intent to communicate, and with no expectation of future communication. If both conditions hold, he could post whatever that guidance is using whatever unambiguous means he chooses.
Even more ideally, he would be willing to communicate if one of the other two cases held - that he had not thought of it and it is best left to the bitcoin community to decide, or that he has an opinion but will not be sharing it.

Sadly, it is now only 83 GBTC at that price.
Someone bought 17 of them from me, setting a new ATH for Bitcoin in the process :-)
Most accurately, it was three separate sales.
1 share sold at around $70.
6 shares sold at $133.7
10 more shares sold at $133.7
The Ask disappeared from the GBTC ask list after the 2nd sale, but the orders were still present, and filled when the last order for 10 came in.
I am guessing they have a few kinks to work out in their filtering and streaming data.
Earlier, for a short period, the 133.7 showed on the main GBTC page. 
Someone on CryptoCrypt even screen-shotted it.
Minutes later, it was back to the $37.98 - $42.00 display.
I am speculating they were playing with the feed parameters, and reverted it to its original semi-broken state before the end of the day.

Thought is being applied to this constantly. A debate rages almost daily within the Gold collapsing, Bitcoin UP thread 
I know less about the issue that many that debate there, but my personal hunch is that sidechains are an eventuality - efficient market will demand that it not act against itself via dilution of competing markets.
If and when that happens, the core will modify. A path will be clear.
At that point, you can rest assured that new offerings will open up allowing you to create and fund your own sidechain.
Hell, when the altcoin boom happened, it only took about two months for someone to write a package to automate the entire process, and offer anyone to create their own altcoin via Ebay. (While the seller retained a % of each created coin!)
There are thorny issues about how funding moves into or out of a chain, why that funding would be necessary, how mining gets handled. Use case analysis to ensure no fatal attack vectors exist.
I expect things to absolutely explode once we get there. I think we'll be focused on the 1MB problem for awhile, so it could be another year until we have a clear path on this.

I can't wait to see what the market does on Wednesday. I expect volume to fill in with higher Bids than appeared at market end, and Asks appearing both to significantly narrow the gap, while also extending to far higher prices. I wouldn't be surprised to see trading volume be 5x what it was today - say, at least 3500 shares. Hell let's go for 5000 :-P
@_date: 2015-05-05 01:58:55
This makes perfect sense. Thank you.
I suppose that in a market with any semblance of volume, it goes unnoticed when the few small bids and asks are not displayed - they are just noise.
We were in the unique situation where the 'noise', at times, represented the entire market.
In other words, it looks like this problem won't solve itself, but will be rendered inconsequential as real volume fills in.
Thanks again for the tremendous information.

**Suggested revisions to the terms of the experiment**
Please post here. Examples include:
-Clear definition of which Unbounding approach will be used.
-Predetermination of initial mining power.
-May need to incentivize miners, or the only motivation to mine is to protect your own chain.
-Distribution terms. (There are more complicated models where initial funding first goes into the experimental coins, then to a central address. At end of experiment the coins could be returned to the initial addresses. Still the money-sink issue if the coin value goes to 0 as it has no future.)
-Anything else I am not thinking of.

I love this idea. But I think for it to be successful, the community needs to be rallied behind, and focused on, the experiment.
**Without a parallel to the real world incentives for both good and bad actors, we won't be accurately modelling the situation we are trying to learn more about.**
I've thought about some sort of funding model for the blockchains (funded by backers of each solution? Research initiatives a la MIT, TBF?) Backers would then be motivated to protect their respective chains.  'Black hats' in the purposes of this experiment would aim to exploit the other blockchain and reap its benefits (the value of its blockchain.)
Specifics would need to be thought through to ensure:
-Transfer of funds into each blockchain.
-How to ensure value to 'black hats' if they were successful.
-How to extricate funds left after a successful experiment.
-Destination of those remaining funds.
Further for maximal value we would need to define:
-Funding start/end dates. 
-Experiment start/end date.
-Terms of success, i.e. no delay of greater than xxx time/blocks, never more than xx% of control...
-Terms of failure
Such an experiment protects the blockchain while allowing us to gain information.

The ask is so high because nobody is selling.
At the start of the day, there were a few shares for $42.
When those dried up, Asks which did not appear on the board continued to be filled for smaller volumes - I sold one around $70 and the rest at $133.7.
Interestingly, the $133.7 stopped appearing in the GBTC feeds after 17 had sold, even though the other 83 remained.
I expect more people to put Asks out tomorrow, and the work of finding the 'new middle' can start.
@_date: 2017-02-02 19:45:56
So in 120 years, the breakeven point would be $7.50 fee.
Let's assume the current cost is $0.25.
5 doublings would take us to $8.
So if inflation goes up 100% per 120/5, or 24 years, then we have already hit that breakeven point.

@_date: 2015-05-05 02:31:21
That is partially correct, in that the redemption process is the only way for new shares to be 'released' to the general market.
Once that occurs, market participants are free to buy and sell them freely. In my case, I took a high risk speculative risk and bought 100 shares around lunch at $41.98. I then sold 17 of them later for $133.7. Whoever bought them could try to resell them tomorrow.
Naturally, this will create a 'price floor' in the minds of the buyers, based on what price they are able to buy from one of the initial sellers.
Most of them are not in a hurry to sell, so I expect share liquidity to remain a bottleneck causing an upward force on price, until the resultant GBTC price is tempting enough that a few more sellers finally start letting go of shares.
TL, DR; Two market factors - 1) rate of release of BIT shares to the market, 2) supply versus demand on available shares.
Only means of increasing net supply is from initial BIT holders selling.

I said that for the past 1 1/2 years about seeing the day I could buy shares of a bitcoin-backed asset from my Roth account.
At this point, I see the future distributions as predictable.
A) 200,000+ coins to be distributed via Kraken to resolve the Mt. Gox debacle. This will also resolve Bitcoinica issues.  Creditors can receive payment in USD, and if approved, BTC.
B) The final SR auction. The market has shown a consistent pattern of 'showing up' for these auctions, absorbing them, and having no market immediate price impact. I expect this sale has been priced into the market for months.
The precedent is now set. It will be easier for COIN and others to follow on. Massive, previously unavailable liquidity can pour into the market.

That's sort of my point.
They're not yet regulated, they are the most stable of that first wave of exchanges, which were cobbled together. Over the years they have cobbled together more stable pieces here and there.
But they did not begin designing their infrastructure with experts. They improved pieces as they went along. This means there are gaping holes which remain.
Each of those decisions (triggering stop losses, disabling orders) are made as one-offs. There is not a clear, agreed-upon way to handle them. So each exchange decides how to do it each time, and any decision will hurt SOME subset of people worse than others.
The Winklevii caught major hell for rolling back a single trade many months back.
Phil, from his audio, was concerned about market movement and was trying to minimize it.
I am guessing they are doing the best they can, choosing from non-ideal scenarios.
As a Software Engineer, I get there is a fine line when you are down, between balancing the likelihood of a fix, against prolonging downtime.
As such, I would expect they would not change their uptime plan on the fly between the first and second instance.
BTW, I've lost loads from exactly this kind of action on Bitfinex...as well as on Gox. It's the nature of the beast, a yet-infantile market. Nothing comes for free. You invest in something that is young and still needs to grow 100/1000x, there are going to be immature spots.
Sorry you got bit by it. It is never any fun.
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:05:25
It is helpful to be aware of the maturity of the market and exchanges we trade within.  Bitfinex and other's behavior today was not optimal. It was also light years of progress from where we were last rally.  
I still remember trading on Mt. Gox, only to realize I was watching a loop of old market activity masquerading as realtime market data.  That's one you don't forget.
I like Bitfinex. They have been around since the early days. But they do suffer from the early adopter curse. They now have a customer base and existing code, and face a new challenge in today's Bitcoin ecosystem. They must evolve their platform to compete with the next generation of systems. Systems built with scaling, hardening, performance, usability...all from the get-go. 
Adapt, or die.  I have watched Bitfinex learn from its mistakes, each time, over the years. They would benefit from picking up the pace a bit, but I expect that both Bitfinex as well as Bitcoin will harden and improve as a result of this last attack...being antifragile and all ;-)

I expect us to (barely) break ATH across all exchanges, then consolidate towards the price of 1oz of gold, with US exchanges getting a chance to catch up.

 If an arbitrage bot  can sell one place for $100.01, and by somewhere else for $100, then that is a profit with no trading fees. 
 But there is an opportunity cost in doing that trade. If your funds were perfectly balanced across exchanges, there will now be an imbalance.  If fund in the quality is random across exchanges then this is not an opportunity cost. But trends tend to persist. 
 Perhaps it is true that the net effect of removing leverage has, at the same time, change the opportunity cost of leverage in such a way that arbitrageurs are more fully utilizing their phones during fund imbalances . 
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:03:32
I get your point. I was trying to keep the example simple, but yes - let's say the same day I buy 1.25 electronic bitcoins for $100 apiece, and use them to purchase the physical, having it cost me $125.
I could complicate it by having the initial cost be variable, but that is really the same question as the simpler one - is the cost basis declared and compared in terms of BTC? If so, neither the spot value at time of acquisition or sale matters. If instead it is in terms of USD, then it matters greatly.

From the discussion so far, it looks like you're right on that. 
As we moved through the explanations and detail, that's what Silly_Balls was saying as well. Interpretation A is not right, Interpretation B is closer.  The lingering question seems to be around whether one can use the Section 1031 like kind exchange rule, when exchanging one form of BTC for another.
The answer to that question did not seem as clear.
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:19:24
To clarify, the example doesn't involve 'cashing out' in the sense of receiving USD. Instead, exchanging it, which has both a physical spot value as well as a premium value paid...and in return receiving electronic bitcoin.
At that moment, a taxable event may be triggered, even with no funds received.
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:32:38
 Another potential reason is that we are now in price discovery. It seemed there was a bit of uncertainty in the air the last few days as we waited to see what are the resolution to the PBOC actions were. Until yesterday there was still a large spread between US and Chinese exchanges, over $30. The increased volume could also just be natural rebalancing across global exchanges to a common price point.
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:28:03
Thank you for the warning. I am painfully aware. The cost of a wrong decision is tremendous on both fronts. To date I have realized the gains at the time of sale. I later learned someone else was given different professional advice than I was.
The implication of not using like kind exchange, effectively kills the collectible market.
The appreciation of the base value means realizing and building in a price increase, minimally to the cost of the taxes, just to break even. No collectible market can withstand 14/28% cuts above and beyond the _actual_ profit-taking.
I had hoped there was some clear, legal precedent I had not come across. It seems there are just strong professional opinions on both side of the coin.
Probably best to just continue erring on the cautious side, and hoping that some deep-pocketed Bitcoin evangelist, or the Bitcoin Foundation, can get a private letter ruling on the subject.

That is a true and exciting comparison.  I'd agree that psychologically this is the valuation most people would first think of. I don't think it was a coincidence we hit parity with ounce-of-gold prices back in Dec. '13.
I get more excited about market cap comparisons.
Gold - 7.8 Trillion
Bitcoin - ~11 Billion.
That gives us a current valuation of 0.14% of gold.
In other words, to have as much money globally in Bitcoin as there is in gold, with today's numbers, bitcoin would need to appreciate 70909% from there it is today. That number? $467,290.
Getting to 1 BTC to parity with 1 oz of gold is a great first step. Lots of room thereafter.

@_date: 2017-01-13 00:53:06
Since the physical coins just have a hidden *address* on them, pointing to the digital coins, I would think they are a like kind exchange.  
Legally speaking, it sounds like it remains unanswered, and all-important.
I'd agree re: The Bitcoin Foundation.  For $10,000, such a question could be submitted to the IRS via a private letter ruling. That ruling could benefit the greater community.
Absent that, I'm leaning towards consulting for an hour with a bitcoin-specializing CPA to get their opinion on my specific situation. I think we'll be able to quickly drill into the question of whether 1031 applies here or not.
Thanks so much for your input here, it has been tremendously helpful.
@_date: 2017-01-13 00:09:30
I greatly appreciate your input on this, Silly_Balls.
Even with 1) and 2) being true, it sounds like there are two concrete conclusions:
a) The notion of like-good for like-good exchange (Interpretation A) is incorrect.
b) The gains seem to be tied to the increase in value of the good, and it is only a question of whether that gain can be deferred, using like kind exchange (same ruling that is used for properties, I assume.)
...but these conclusions just seem...illogical.
What if I bought a 100 BTC bar when spot was $100. And I decided I just wanted to trade it with another guy that had a different 100 BTC bar, but I liked the vanity address better.  And the spot price of the coins is $1000 that day.
Now suddenly, I've realized $90,000 in gains for trading bars.
...So to me, that seems so ridiculous, it can't be true.
And yet, I think it's the same as the first example above, where BTC are exchanged for BTC.

Faucets are evolving.
The notion of handing out bitcoins for free works, so long as the giver has a desire to do so. It matters not whether the giver's motivation is altruism or profit.
I believe the next generation of faucets will all be interactive. I got hooked on a new game, CoinBrawl, a few days back. It reminds me of Mob Wars in 2008 - a retro feel, with the core idea being to combat against other players.
The currency of choice? Satoshis, of course. They are withdrawable to a real wallet. You can choose whether to spend the satoshis you earn in-game, or withdraw them.
As you level up, you can earn more satoshis.
The top guys are earning something like 30,000 satoshis/hour.
...so while the givers have a choice, so too do the takers. They will be driven to find faucets that a) give them the most stuff for free, and b) makes that process minimally painful, or best case, enjoyable.
If you do decide to build a faucet, expect to get a lot of experience in defensive programming, as automated bots will be set on it as soon as it is live, if the reward is at all of value.
Good luck!

I don't think that's the way VCs tend to think in general - they stand to gain so much more by investing in the infrastructure.
In Bitcoin's case, the secondary investment in the asset itself is important, largely because the relative market size is still so small compared to other commodity- or currency-based investment.
With Bitcoin, such an investment seems logical.
Perhaps some VCs would use 80% of their funding for their company and 20% in Bitcoin. Perhaps others would go 95/5.  Another choice would be to keep additional investment money, not-yet-spent, in a mix of USD and BTC that is not 100/0.
It is odd to me that all the large investors to date have chosen to take the 100/0 split in both investment, and remaining funds, in terms of USD/BTC.

The ability to communicate intent is a wonderful advancement.
The ability to communicate future intent without requiring a hard fork represents a reactionary, positive, systemic hardening of the protocol.

Found it - here's the "Advanced" version (Again - this is a public doc, make a private copy before entering your own data.) 
It has the Rebuy sheet filled in. It correlates to the previous sell sheet, and lets each order track whether its rebuy has occurred.
It was helpful during the December rally.

Here's one I've used to pre-plan my sells. If you want to get fancy, you can also set up planned rebuys for those sells.
Typical disclaimers - this is not trading advice, consult your own legal counsel with respect to tax implications, etc.
If there's interest, I can also share the 'Advanced' version. It gives you a few more ways to screw yourself up ;-)
**Note** - This is a public document. Don't put your real data in here. Play around with some fake data, and if you like it, shamelessly steal a copy for yourself, and play away :-)

Once all the railroad tracks have been laid, will there still be jobs for people?
I challenge you to make any statement you can be certain of which lies 125 years in the future.
How much stock would you put in predictions of what 2016 would look like from someone living in 1891? Would you believe they would do a better job of securing 2016's future by looking 120+ years in the future, or to leave it to those of us existing in it?

I was a 2011 investor. I HODL. Cars aren't really my thing.

I have some 2011 and 2012 pieces. Once upon a time I was rather active in promoting and trading these coins.
My read since the rally ended nearly 2 years ago is that the market is flat, and it has been a buyer's market.
I am holding my pieces until the next rally begins.
That said, Ebay and Bitcointalk are the two best places I know of if you are looking to sell now.

Start around page 11. They are actively appealing for interested parties to share their opinions. They go on to ask several questions for which they invite commenter's opinions.
Here's the excerpt from page 11:


views, data, and arguments with respect to the issues identified above, as well as any other
concerns they may have with the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written
views of interested persons concerning whether the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) or
any other provision of the Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not
appear to be any issues relevant to approval or disapproval that would be facilitated by an oral
presentation of views, data, and arguments, the Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule
19b-4, any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation.

I am not saying what is right and wrong. I am speculating what I expect the net effect to be, from all participants.

The last time requests were made, Jorge Stolfi submitted an effective, condemnatory submission.
My hope and expectation is that this submission request will reach the right Bitcoin proponents. They will be equipped to articulately address the various concerns posed, along with the most current proposed solutions within the Bitcoin sphere.
*This* is the opportunity that must not be squandered.

Ask yourself this - A week from today, will you hold any of the following assumptions:
-Satoshi must be dead (or he would have rebuffed the false claim)
-Access to the 1 million coins is lost (reduced market threat)
-Tired of Satoshi searches, desirous to cease searching
-No reason to look at Dr. Craig Wright again.
PR firms help shape reactions. The community reaction to this has been nearly universal. They either succeeded or failed wildly.
It seems to me that the net effect to Bitcoin is a positive one.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:08:38
 Two halvings from now this will be 160% the block reward. And people worry about 100 years from now, and why miners will continue.
 The counterbalancing force to reduce net fees is to increase block size,  to distribute that cost among more people. 
 There must be tension between these two points, and on the century scale we are still bootstrapping. And imperfect solution which is not wrong will move us forward in time without failure and make the possibility of failure lower in the future.

I am saying that I don't know, and it is possible that is by design.
We know Dr. Wright received unwanted attention beginning late last year. I wouldn't use the term publicity stunt.  Damage control might be a better term.
Only those involved know how much they weighed personal needs versus Bitcoin. I tend to give the benefit of the doubt to people who in the past have 'fought the good fight'.

 The Raw data is nice, the text overlay is misleading at best. 
1.  We should have been buying at the  2013 high? 
2.   Selling half, must be in terms of net worth in and out of Bitcoin.  That racial can be maintained as the price continues to skyrocket. I would further add nobody is saying 50%, some people might choose to keep 10% net worth in bitcoin and others might choose to keep 90%.
