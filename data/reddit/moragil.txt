I have the same problem as the OP even though I live in EU (I just don't get any physical mail to my address). I used the Linden dollar way to get some BTC. It was really fast the second time around but I had to pay about 15% of the total sum in various fees. It's good if you want to get in before a big rise but it's really bad for making a large investment (which I would have done already a year ago if any site had verified me).

Thanks, I'll try the local thing again, but we're a really small country and the offers are very limited. Also, any on-line method would be much more comfortable. Still hoping there is a way out there.

Please explain how to deposit cash to btc-e without verifying your address? All the deposit methods (OKPay, EgoPay, Bank Transfer) seem to require verification.

I have tried Coinbase but it seems I have to verify a bank account and that's US only? I had high hopes for Coinbase when I saw "Coinbase is an **international** digital wallet" but sadly, it's only the wallet part that's international, not the purchasing part.
I'll point out more clearly that I live in Estonia, EU. Thank you for the response, though!

That would mean that I'd have to buy physical gold, then find someone who would want it and then mail it. I'm not sure that the exchange rate would be better than buying by the roundabout Second Life way, for example.
There are a few offers on localbitcoins.com but they are all 200 km away from me. I'll probably drive and meet up with someone eventually but first I'd like to explore any option which would allow me to buy them on-line with a credit card or bank transfer (without address verification).
I believe my last resort, before mailing gold to anyone, would be to change my official address in the national register (which I currently have in another city for social security benefits and other purposes) and then apply for a proof of residency. That should clear up things with Bitstamp registration, for example.

It's actually about 40 bucks (10 * 5 mBTC), just 5 copies of each address, but it's still sweet.
