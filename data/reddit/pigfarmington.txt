Anything that takes power of the powerful will be subjected to propaganda.  This just means that it's good for us, and they know it.

But money is...even though you can simply print more?

a-hem.... wall street bankers.  how's that investigation going?

They've never been.  Ask poor people, Native Americans and black people.

I would assume they pulled them over because their plates.

I had to take a private student loan once when I lost me job in college. 
Long story short: I played off my WF student loan about a month ago. Right when I did the guy wanted to sell me shit that would put me right back into debt.  Actually encouraged me to go to grad school and take out a loan. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:49:01
If you were naive enough to buy it when it spiked and was selling at $1000 you, deserved it.

Because we all know consumers have tons of liquid cash just sitting in their bank accounts.

This is why the US government wants the ability to kill your phone.

The law they broke: you can't try to dismantle the current banking status quo.

I'd believe that the FBI and Federal Government are the ones leading us all to a very dark place.  
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:23:27
You know what's a huge red flag. Dark skin. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 15:16:41
Because WF is such a nice business, right? When considering their past predatory lending practices, were they just trying to make a buck? Poor WF.
If I'm going to grad school just to go further into debt, what am I going for? Probably not a decision that should be made just so WF can make more money. 
These are banks that have no morality... No social accountability. And that's a problem seeing how big of an impact they have on the world.

And they cherry-pick who to press charges on.

This is purely about the ability to spy on everyone on a computer. Period. Its like being God. They won't relinquish that power. Their top priority is to maintain the status quo of power. Monitor communication and you will keep it.

If you're shocked by this, you're not paying enough attention.

I started an MTGox account 2 days before this happened. Had yet to buy any coin. Dodged a bullet. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:39:54
Damn, $229 is what I just checked.  Damn.  Glad I didn't buy a year ago.

Imagine a group of people who go around town and check on everybody.  Ask them what they're doing, where they're going and sometimes, when the person they're talking to questions why they're asking, they get tased, slammed, arrested, shot, etc.  These people then take that person's possessions. When high authority finds out and the person questioned is not further punished... they sell their possessions and keep the money. 
Cops are fucking crooks.   
@_date: 2016-06-09 16:38:56
Not sure.  The older we get the less frequently we talk :(  My guess is no, but slight maybe. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:26:57
Cops are fucking corrupt as fuck. 
I once had a friend had his apt. raided for no reason.  None.  He had a few thousand in cash.  It disappeared. 
Edit: That is the full story.  They said he was a drug dealer.  He wasn't.  I know him.  He was one of my best friends and had known him since middle school. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 11:27:41
[Already do]( But...you get tased into brain damage. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 14:53:10
Not using a bank is suspicious. And people really think government is the one on charge

Just add three zeros to all the $1 notes. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:18:33
Yep, I'm sure there were some very nice Nazis too.  I'm not saying cops are Nazis, I'm saying the system in which they work in is corrupt and some take full advantage. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 22:32:28
He asked what their evidence was. Turns out it was because of where his car was parked once.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:10:03
They said he was a drug dealer.  He wasn't.  I have known him since middle school and was one of my best friends at the time.

Buying on margins.

Americans love their political boundaries. Makes exploitation easier to blame of the foreign governments rather than domestic corporations.

Whoda thought.

It's a new fearful slogan that the ignorant and fearful will eat up.  Or at least the media will make it seem that way.

Bitcoin will be linked to "terrorism" soon enough. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:59:46
I have been buying BTC for over a year and never spent any.  I just sent it to them.  It was so easy I honestly couldn't believe it. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 16:25:12
So, it's no longer terrorist money?
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:28:49
Oh... so the Fed and all them were lying?!  :O

Wow... win-win for the ruling class.  
Clampdown on rights and overall dissent

This is the type of issues we need to get off our complacent assess and hold the ruling class and their political puppets accountable for once.  
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:33:44
Hmm... May want to look into socialism. We're living in a plutocratic republic under the guise of democracy.  Giving into deregulation and capitalism is what helped us get here.

One time I was at six-flags on a day nobody was there.  I rode Batman probably 30 times.  Eventually I was doing this for the in-ride camera.

Awesome rebuttal. 
You seem to be under the assumption that I'm trying to assimilate people.  Spoken like a true neo-liberal.

Don't forget monthly fees, check your balance fee, fund re-charge fee, expired card re-issuance fee, contact call center for support fee, and annual fee.

I don't know what it is, and the banks who tell me what to do tell me not to like it.

I fail to see the resources being controlled by the people and for the people.  It's quite the opposite. I still see a scarcity driven economy rather than supply.  
Your link proves my point that you have no clue.  Hitler was a  fascist, and what he did smacks in the face of socialism.  Why do you think he put them in concentration camps?  Hitler just continued the use of the term to appeal to those influenced by socialism/Marxism's rise to popularity after the depression. (Hitler hated Marx and his belief in no personal property)  It's just a word, but in practice... No, Hitler was no socialist. 
"I absolutely insist on protecting private property... we must encourage private initiative". - Hitler
Again, you seem to lack information about socialism and its various forms.

I'm currently at relatives for Thanksgiving and never see cable. The propaganda on 24/7 news for allowing more surveillance is frightening and worse than I thought. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:32:47
If you try to explain that to many people in the US, they'll say you've been influenced by the liberal socialist media.

On NPR yesterday, they were phrasing it as if Bitcoin was part of the problem/blame, and that trading/using it was illegal.

Nothing like a good stereotype to make you feel better about your surroundings.
