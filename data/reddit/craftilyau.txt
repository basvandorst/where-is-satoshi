Blockfolio feature request: When my alert is triggered, automatically reset it at +$1k. Getting annoying having to do it manually multiple times per day
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:29:28
I say buy a little (I think you mention $100 elsewhere).  It will get you more interested in learning and reading about Bitcoin and crypto more generally.  $100 isn't going to make a dent in your $30k debt, nor is it going to make you rich.  But it *should* give you a greater return than the interest on your debt, give you a reason to invest your time and effort into learning more, and if you lose it well I am sure you've blown that much on a night out or fancy restaurant before anyway.
Just don't get further into debt just to invest because that path could lead somewhere nasty.

You're not alone ... I have a transaction sitting for 4 days so far (60sat/byte) and one at a day (414sat/byte).  It's pretty much just broken at the moment unless you pay super high fees and even then no guarantee.

You do realise that every buy is also sell, right?  Finite number of coins means for one person to buy another has to sell.
The green/red colours on the recent trades just indicates whether it's a purchase made during an upswing or downswing.

You mean BUY wall.  Just over 4K BCH orders at 3099.99.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's Ver himself using the opportunity to cement a new price tier for BCash.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:47
Just factor in the fees ... if you can put in $100 ahead of time that might be better than $25/week for 4 weeks.  But if you need to save up, then $25/week at the moment is a better bet than waiting a month to invest $100.  
If that makes any sense? haha.

It's amazing how it only really hits home when you try to use it rather than HODL.  
I came across a nifty [github project]( yesterday to check your forked coin balance (as a relatively newb I wasn't sure which I had as I've been buying gradually since early October).
Wanted to donate $10 as thanks, suggested fee was $14.  I adjusted it down to 150s/byte but that still meant $8 fee, meaning it cost me $18 to send $10 and I still had no idea when it would confirm (turns out it didn't take that long).

@_date: 2017-12-13 10:11:44
Ah gotcha.  So if someone buys my BTC for sale at $17,249.95 I pay no fees, but if I buy someone's BTC at $17,250.00 I pay a fee?  Makes much more sense now.

Okay someone explain to me the standoff for the sake of a few cents.  The book shows 685 BTC for sale at $17,250.00, and 21 BTC to buy at $17,249.95.  If all those 21 went through at $17,250.00 it would cost an extra $1.05!  What's the deal?

It's ridiculous that Bitcoin is trading at +US$2,000 here (AU$22k = US$16.5k).  Until the last few days it was trading fairly in line with the USD but now it's way out.
