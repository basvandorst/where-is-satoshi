Total shit coins. Bad team, doesn’t moon every other week. Would watch out

I came to crypto for the tech (and money) I stayed for the memes. Solid work mate 
Tron was 10/10. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:20:33
what negative news? Aside from BitConnect, which can be viewed as a good thing, I don't see anything that stands out.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:51:53
Solid advice

Bro look what sub you’re in.

Not only will it be a nonissue because of that but the crypto demographic is on the younger side. If we learned anything from Sanders 2016 campaign, young supports don’t actually go out and vote. Don’t see this making any difference
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:40:45
Unless you are doing some sketchy shit and causing security measures to be tripped, you shouldn’t be getting screwed for simply trading. Trading is required for the growth of any market. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:27:04
While true, it kind of illuminates the stupidness of the medium. It tries to force its users to be concise and to the point but most of the time people just post multipart tweets or link to another post that allows them to write longer messages. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 17:12:46
There is nothing to call tho. The service is free, that means that there is a 99.99% chance they are selling your data. That’s like saying its going to be cold in the winter. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:08:20
What was to call? 
If it’s free, you’re the product. 
This is nothing new. Pay for shit then you won’t have this issue.

By reducing supply, the market grows even more illiquid thus making it more susceptible to manipulation. I’m not saying leave your funds on a exchanges if you want to hold them but your logic is wrong. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:19:31
I never said holding provides liquidity. I said the opposite. It doesn’t matter if you have open bids/asks. Buy holding you are essentially removing circulating supply. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:44:03
It means as the price of Bitcoin goes down, shitcoins die. 
The amount of pure hot dumpster fire left in this space is still amazing. Just wait till you see what happens when the ICO’s start selling off whatever they have left. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:23:23
No one is arguing against leverage volatility. If you want to remain spot while holding funds on a leveraged exchange, either don’t have an open position, short/long with 1x leverage or have a hedge. 
It’s very clear people here don’t know how to trade. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:59:01
I don’t follow people blindly. I make my own decisions. Iv been shorting since 18k. I’d rather take advice from someone who has had professional experience than some mouth breather who thinks holding shitcoins like nano and ada will make him rich. 
No one trader is always right but Tones predictions through out the bear market have been all correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:28
Time to buy more!

He doesn’t even trade Bitcoin anymore. Most of his wealth is in Bitcoin so he benefits from the price going up not down. He’s experience in professional trading in traditional markets tells him we are going lower before we see ATH again. Sorry that hurts your feelings. 
Go back to holding your -90% shitcoin bags.

It’s not bias if it’s factual. What you take away from the information is bias not the information itself.

This meme added another year to the bear market
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:41:46
Traditionally markets bottom one of two ways. Either a massive capitulation with an equal or greater bounce up or side ways movement in a price channel. Back in 2015 bear market, we got both. I’m hoping for the former. Rip the band aid off rather than slowly and painfully go through the process. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:52:56
Don’t get my wrong. I still have a short open from 7.8. This is not the bottom. Don’t be fooled. But a bounce was expected sooner or later 
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:44:05
Sarcasm bro.. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:18:27
You have no business trading if you had a high leverage short open below 5.9 right after a recent drop and were just asking to be liquidated. 
No volume pump into major resistance. I’ll call that bluff. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:48:50
Correct. Just like nothing go ups forever, nothing goes down forever either. After consecutive weeks/days of negative or positive price action, you are likely to see what technical analysts call a relief rally or correction. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:47:21
Probably more bitcoin than most people on this sub tbh 
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:20:24
1.	NEVER tell anyone how much Bitcoin you own or how much money you have, unless you trust this person with your life. 
2.	 Take out the hard drive from the laptop and place it in a working machine.
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:19:44
It’s only fdic insured when in USD not when your funds are in crypto. Same with coinbase 
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:23:42
Yes but only because I know the tech will eventually catch up with the price and catapult it up again. DCA back in more when I can. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:18:11
Not zero but back to $1300 if we keep falling. If $1300 breaks we are truly in for a rough ride 
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:07:48
$1is still $1. This argument has always been stupid
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:19:39
Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing with wanting to be make money off of crypto. We are early investors, I sure as hell would like to benefit from that but I just find the hypocrisy ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:12:45
PoS has plenty of issues as well. The main problem with PoW is power consumption while PoS brings a whole slew of issues. Why do you think ETH has been struggling with it for so long...
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:47:52
The same people who are anti government are the same people who cry about exchange hacks, lost/stolen funds, slow services etc.  I have no problem with exchanges cooperating with government if it means it will benefit the customer. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:19:31
DBZ and Crypto, my favorite things 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:32:07
Who said coinbase isn’t safe? They get a lot of hate around here but understand they have been in the game for several years now and are 100% legitimate exchange. Arguably more so than any other competitor. They have yet to be hacked. The customer service is questionable but it’s as “safe” as it gets in crypto. And yes the inside trading is shady AF but it’s a unregulated market. Stuff like this happens. People want decentralized and less regulation but start to cry when something like this happens. 
If you really don’t like Coinbase maybe look at Gemini. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 15:35:00
You can't call it a store of value and ignore the market price. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:26:45
Every time bitcoin has reached a new ATH it has always come back to retest it. $1300 is the only price that hasn’t. If enough time passes, lower s/r levels have less significance but because BTC jumped from $900 to almost $20,000 in less than a year it’s still a possibility. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:01:41
It needs to close above 9100 on the daily to consider 10k. Heavy resistance at 9400
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:43:00
I think you meant ����
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:48:51
As it should be. Gotta love the USA where we have idiots electing other idiots to be in charge 
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:21:36
You people are ridiculous. 
“Crypto isn’t a currency until I can pay my taxes with it”
“We accept crypto for tax payments”
“Why the hell would I do that, so I can show you my bags?
That’s the problem with this community. Most of us are in it for the money and greed, not for the tech. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 16:52:17
3k is not a bullshit number. Plenty of TA to back it up
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:45:17
No one said it’s a science you idiot. It’s based off probability not fact. The evidence is the amount of money people make who understand TA. Go back holding you -90% bag and stop wasting people’s time. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:48:33
An ETF will not help adoption. Don’t fool yourself. Nothing fundamentally changes if an ETF gets approved. Bitcoin at 20k was fundamentally worse than it is now. Remember how clogged the mempool was? Remember those stupidly high fees? Ya I’m sure an ETF will fix that all up. Let the tech catch up before screaming for ETF solely to pump your bags. 
I’m purely in it for the money because the tech is no where near ready. I don’t lie to myself.
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:15:38
Not sure about recently but anyone who thinks that the dollar isn’t backed by threat of military force is being ignorant

@_date: 2018-07-02 19:31:17
That’s not how TA works. We are not fortunetellers with a magic ball. Certain criteria have to be met in order for the price action model to be accurate enough to be profitable. The current bear model fails if price successfully exceeds 7k and a bottom in July fails. If you think there is only one potential scenario then you will fail. I’m not being vague. I’m not here to be your financial advisor and give you a play by play. Do your own research if you care. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:32:11
No it’s not.  No one using the Bitcoin, it’s only on paper.  The average Joe doesn’t give two shits about an ETF. The only reason they would be interested in it for is a retirement account. If you want that, just buy the actual damn thing not not some pink sheet. 
2009: “Fuck the banks! Buy Bitcoin” 
2018: “Banks please buy Bitcoin” 
No one is in it for the tech. All this shit is just driven by greed. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:05:21
Why are you looking towards the government for approval that bitcoin is legit? That goes against everything Bitcoin stands for. Bitcoin isn’t ready for adoption outside of niche cases. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 06:10:53
I was talking about people that are fighting for an ETF approval. Not Satoshi... 
@_date: 2019-09-17 16:33:47
It’s backed by the US military..
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:30:37
Well after a period of a lot of sideways trading. ATH of shorts that got liquidated we saw a massive price jump. Im not truly convinced that we are done with the bear market just yet. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:03:08
Depends on the next few weeks. If the acceleration down continued if we could seen it hit 3-4k mid July with a close back to 5k. But whichever whale is playing the market right now is just delaying the inevitable and screwing with the original analysis. Which is fine, the model will just have to adjust for it. It’s looking like Bitcoin will probably have to go even lower and take longer for a true reversal. 2014/15 all over again.

I’ll be honest. I came to bitcoin and crypto for the money. Ended up staying for the tech. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:24:40
Man with tremendous amount invested into bitcoin is bullish on bitcoin. Who would have thought. 10/10 piece of “journalism”.

Yaaa while I was reading his reply I was thinking to myself he just proved your point. 
Soros doesn’t give a shit about crypto or fiat. He will screw over anything if it means becoming wealthier one way or another. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:29:34
Yes because a Japanese based exchange that originally dealt with trading cards is the same as Coinbase or Gemini which are FDIC backed. 
When you go market buy your favorite shitcoin on Binanace who do you think is selling it to you? You wouldn’t get millions in trade volume if everyone held funds off exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:51:58
I leave what I trade on exchanges. I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. Just don’t use shady exchanges. Where do you think liquidity in the order books come from? Where do you think the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars of volume comes from?
