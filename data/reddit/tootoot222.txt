The problem is not with the merchant, but with the users. Do some sort of competition or tournament with the prizes being some amount of bitcoin. Give out a whole lot of prizes, like 20, but everything except the top 2 or 3 are very small amounts. Even if only 10 people actually claim the prizes, they will have been introduced to crypto, and maybe 2 or 3 of those will get it enough to be able to donate or even help other users figure out how to do it (if the community is strong enough).
Edit: also if you require that contest participants enter their bitcoin receiving addresses in order to register for the competition, it will increase user adoption even more, even if those people don't win anything.

When segwit activates it doesn't create a new chain, but anybody who doesn't upgrade their client can only verify transactions at a SPV proof level.

It'll be just like the BCH fork. If enough miners don't participate, it dies. If they do all move forwards, it'll be a wakeup call for anybody running a fire-and-forget shop when none of their transactions go through anymore.

No, you can still make normal, non-segwit transactions, just like now. If they don't upgrade, you just can't make the new segwit style transactions until they do.

What is this a scene from? The cinematography of that shot looks really good, curious if the rest of the movie is like that.

Telling someone the private key isn't in of itself illegal. It's what happens afterwards that is (large sums of untracked money changing hands). 
Imagine telling somebody the location and combination of a lockbox with millions in cash inside. Just telling them where it is isn't illegal, but if they've just handed you a million euros in exchange, then the unlicensed money exchange was illegal.

It's actually the same block. Segwit transactions verify the signature data (the witness data - - segregated witness) in a secondary structure referenced from the block. It makes the transactions smaller, so you can fit more of them in one block.

There's a lot of transactions, and they propagate across the network at different speeds. Choosing which transactions go into a block is an implementation of the well known Knapsack Problem (google it). There can be many ways to solve it, but it will rely on the order of the transactions in your local implementation since many transactions will have exactly the same fee per byte, among other things. 
So no, simply by looking at a snapshot of a given node's mempool and the transactions which were included in a block, you will not be able to tell, unless the block is much less than empty (all transactions should/could have been included, but weren't).

I think this sums it up nicely.

A soft fork is a strengthening (addition) of rules. A hard fork is a weakening (removal) of rules.
Since SegWit introduces new rules, the only way to remove those rules is via a hard fork.

No, due to variance, if the mining rate drops by exactly half (in and of itself unlikely that it's exactly 50%, but disregard that for now), the expected value of how long it will take to finish the 2016 block cycle will still be 4 weeks. It's basic statistics.

If a new block is mined after the fork, the coins created by that block will not be on the other chain, since a different miner mined it with different transactions etc. If you include even a very small amount of those newly minted coins as one of the inputs to a multi input transaction (where the other inputs are your normal coins), the new coins only exist an exactly one of the sides of the fork, and the other chain will reject any transaction which tries to spend these non-existent coins.
Not a particularly great solution unless you're a miner, and it takes 100 blocks to be able to spend newly minted coins anyway.
Best way would be if one chain did a soft fork to reject transactions not destined for its chain (but this inherently makes that chain more restrictive, and thus less likely to be used at all).

It's because blocks aren't perfectly 10 minutes apart. If  they were always exactly 10 minutes apart, then you would be correct. However, finding a block is a poisson process, and thus some blocks are 5 minutes apart, and some are 35 minutes apart. Cutting the mining power in half makes these times twice as much, so now a random 30 minute interval takes 60 minutes. Thus the average is actually weighted back up again, so no matter what random point you choose in the 2016 block interval, the average time to the end of the period, if you pick enough random points, is 4 weeks (2016 blocks at 20 minutes apart).

Difficulty does decrease. Every 2016 blocks (which at 10 minute block interval, is 2 weeks). However, if, say 50% of the miners suddenly went offline (which pushes the block interval to 20 minutes), it would take 4 weeks to reach the full 2016 blocks, where the difficulty would then drop down to make it average out at 10 minute blocks again.

You mean reducing the number of miners who could accept your transaction by 70%? I love the thought of increasing the wait time for  the first confirmation by &gt;3x...

They have something like 6 to 10 years to back-audit. So it may be a while. Also you won't really know why they're doing the audit (what lead them to review you), you'll just be asked to provide documentation for everything in the last 6-10 years.
