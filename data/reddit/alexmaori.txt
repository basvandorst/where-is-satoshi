Interesting point , why not
However remember, btc can rise dramatically while you’re sleeping
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:01:31
So you’re saying the current dip is created by the bank’s lobby?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:35:23
You can do this simple procedure via many exchanges. You can also keep your BTC on their wallets
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:59:39
Good on you, mate
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:27:46
Excellent answer 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:31:20
Haha, nice
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:16:05
It’s gonna be $30K in about week time 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:45
Well, it’s $13,630 right now, not too bad either
In order to give you good advice please tell how much you’ve bought?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:53:04
I’m interested as well. Subscribing 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:52:33
Impressive, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:45:29
Nice staff 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:55:31
Might take some time I presume
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:43:59
Interesting story, just read the article 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:00:55
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:17:59
You won't believe but I've just did the same.
And it's Monday approaching 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:50:41
Because of the traffic jam
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:54:38
Looks like he is doing many transactions as well
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:52:08
Any ideas on when the massive retaliation will take place?
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:32:34
It is definitely shady
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:52:36
And this is a perfect 100% true statement
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:31:13
Hard not to agree
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:12:40
Exactly, just curious what could we celebrate in one month from now?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:30:10
Just secure your private keys to your wallet but leave a way to access them after you’re gone. This should work perfectly 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:24:05
Unbelievable stuff 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:28:06
For sure plenty of movies are on the way to the screen 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:14:14
So you're back to BTC now?
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:18:28
You have to be silly enough to pay BTC for striptease nowadays 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:01:10
KhaKha, u made my day
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:25:29
So the "papa" will hit 10K by the end of the year
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:42:07
The fees, they say "the highest we have seen in the history BTC"...$100!! Ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:25:55
1,5 billion?!
I like it anyway
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:10:48
I just love it having the fact the significant majority of earth population is still outside of crypto world 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:56:01
Who knows... From my humble opinion, with all the ongoing forks I think the miners are behind 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:57:31
If it is a matter of love, a real sincerely love... The love you'll never betray..
Then yes, no need to leave it
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:30:00
Just curious how much BTC is that?
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:09:03
Very funny.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:34:19
Amazing stuff we’re witnessing 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:31:26
I remember the times when these kind of fees were in existence 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:24:41
So do not want more declines? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:05:49
Thats about it
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:21:29
Well, the current bitcoin situation is unbelievable and paradoxical indeed. It's something new to the world which never experienced in the past. I think it's not really good idea to compare all this to financial crisis a few years back 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:45:24
What is ur opinion on that?
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:59:11
By saying "during our next round" do you mean the current round is already over?
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:23:24
I've used ShapeShift, yes the confirmation is being pending with "awaiting exchange" status.  
Awaiting exchange is the status given for exchanges that have been received, confirmed on the network, and are awaiting the exchange process from ShapeShift. The next step will be a completed Shift! :D

This is from Exodus:
"WARNING: Bitcoin transaction fees are the highest we have ever seen in the history of Bitcoin. These fees are paid directly to the Bitcoin network to process your transaction. Exodus does not keep ANY of the network fees. We are currently seeing Bitcoin fees range from $25 USD up to $100 USD"
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:13:31
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:05:36
Exactly you're 100% right 
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:07:43
Nothing is artificial about bitcoin, mate, all ups &amp; downs are natural

That's on his twitter yesterday:
"We closed on our retirement property near the island of Dominica. We're moving there for good in one week with our staff. But nothing will change. It's the Internet age, plus you will see me at every important conference. I will still be with you. First photo: view from our pool..."
