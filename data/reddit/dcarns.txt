That is very helpful. I will need to experiment and then update the guide to include that tip.

Dash is a very cool alt coin.

First, congratulations for making it this far! I am glad it work out up until this point.
You are certainly right that I did not explain that step thoroughly. I will update the site with more detail.
You need to copy the 'blocks' folder and the 'chainstate' folder from your mac to your Pi's **.bitcoin** folder located at **~/.bitcoin** . (aka **/home/pi/.bitcoin**).
Let me know if that helps.

Thanks! I will add a mention of WinSCP for PC and Cyberduck for Mac.

You're site is much more detailed....nice! I like the option of the external USB drive.

Fixed. Thanks!

I put together this guide for running a node on a Raspberry Pi:

Is ShapeShift.io a good tool to use as a mixer?

Each wallet has it plusses and minuses. But for me, it strikes a good balance of paranoia, ease-of-use, and features.

LOL - well, apparently I was being simplistic. Ah well. Nothing like being called out on the internet for being naive.

I know it sounds simplistic, but I was thinking of leaving "handouts" at food trucks and small businesses explaining bitcoin and how easy it is. Laminated handouts, as people don't throw those away as readily. If they knew bitcoin existed, knew how easy it is, and knew that supporters are willing to go out of their way to support businesses that support bitcoin, then I think it might work.

I have been able to restored across my iPad and Android phone without issue. As long as I have those 12 words (in the right order), I was all set.

Order placed! And just letting you know I had no problems placing the order and using a generic bitcoin wallet (Mycelium) to pay by scanning the QR code.

I've been holding my first bitcoin for the past two weeks....gotta say, it has been worth the price of admission just for all of the entertainment.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:59:06
Much appreciated! Will try to make a bunch of mistakes, first, and then might PM for advice to save me from myself. ;-)

My new Raspberry Pi just arrived today for that very purpose.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:17:42


Just downloaded mycelium. Great app. Nicely put together. Thanks for the recommendation.

I just got into Bitcoin about two months ago. I started out just running SPV wallets so that I could testing things and and see if I wanted to devote more resources (even if minimal). 
I decided running a full node was the "right thing to do" and just spun up a Raspberry Pi full node this weekend (currently up to a height of 302,000 blocks in the verification process). 
While people are still considering, I found this to be a good option:
