Because only complete morons would be using it. It has been a "shithole" for months and months. If you trusted a site like that with your real money, you won't get much sympathy from me.

Like any currency network, LN will need critical mass for it to be useful. That is incredibly hard to reach and is why there are 10000 alt coins that are basically useless. Bitcoin, is the oldest and largest crypto currency network and not a single one of my friends or places I transact with will accept it as payment. No one knows for sure how long mass adoption of LN amongst bitcoiners will take but I think years is the correct denomination of time.

Ok, I'll bite... I have tested, nothing to report. I don't code... So how can I help?

He means borrow USD using your BTC as collateral. That way you have USD you can use to buy a car, and don't have to sell your BTC so you can avoid paying short term higher taxes on it now. This type of financial transaction comes with risks and complexity so is not for your average joe.

You're paying a "fee" through a bad conversion/exchange rate. When you purchase using the Shift Card, they use the coinbase bitcoin spot price which is always higher than the GDAX bitcoin exchange price. Coinbase and GDAX are the same company. 
I supposed if you normally buy your bitcoin at coinbase, you're used to paying 2% more for your bitcoin so in that sense, there is no fee.
There is nothing inherently wrong with what Coinbase is doing, they are a business and need to make money. Just wanted to clarify that it's not "no fee".

The "network" part of Lightning Network will take a long time develop into usable network. It's the same chicken and egg new network problem all altcoins have. It will take years for LN to become usable even after it's released as perfect bug free software. The software frankly is the easy part, developing the network is the hard part and why there are 10000 altcoins that no one uses.

That's what they said about segwit.

He was just in the USA recently so I don't think he's barred from entry to the US.

She didn't give a timeline, she ignored the question entirely.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:59:20
high fees=no ebay, no amazon. Right now bitcoin is only good as a speculative asset only.

The test or contribute line I've seen a lot and it's just a snarky deflection. As I said, 99% of users aren't coders... 
I'm not asking for a miracle, just more candidness. If they know it's not happening in 6 months, which I'd bet it's not, just say that and set people's expectations. If they can't even give a rough ballpark, that means it's still years away and half of r/bitcoin thinks it's coming any day now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:21:43
I have tested it, seems to work ok at the test phase. I'm not a coder and neither are 99% of potential users, so those snarky remarks are pointless. Refusal to give any kind of timeframe makes me think it's still "18 months away" and that I should move to a different crypto network as BTC seems FUBAR.

Every other exchange in the world charges for outgoing btc, even bitfinex who has huge volume to "cover these fee costs"... I think it's naive to think free transactions will last forever... 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:57:45
Generally, bitcoin is being engineered towards a high high fee model.  Those people who are not ok with high fees and slow confirmations have already or are in the process of moving to bitcoin cash and other coins.

Why won't core put in a one time 2 or 4MB upgrade NOW to hold us over until all the other "solutions" actually materialize years down the road? It's just not logical...

The hope is that lightning network will allow for huge scaling increases. If segwit adoption is any indication, it will be years before lightning network is released in production and adopted widely enough to make a difference.

As someone who uses hitbtc, do you have any proof?
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:56:23
Most recent comments from developers I've seen say 18 months. Considering this is software development, I personally am thinking 2-3 years.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:53:21
I would bet 18-24 months before production release and then many more years before it's enough of a network to actually be useful.

Miners are just signalling, it's not set in stone. Even if they do prefer S2X and are willing to mine it for less money, it doesn't mean they'll mine it exclusively. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:02:36
You may be right and they may release a finalized spec prematurely. It seems like it would be way too early looking at the current issues they have. I would be foolish to bet on when developers will release as "production ready", they could release today and call it ready. My main point is that it won't be mostly bug-free and trustworthy for at least a few years. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:27:25
But what does huge savings mean roughly in KB or %?
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:59:18
Seems like an obvious question with no answer that I can see. How much does this help scale?
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:01:52
As usual, it's a mix of both. If every bitcoin transaction cost $1000, how much would it change the world? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:32:45
I wouldn't say they aren't fungible, they do have a lot of experience working with the code. My main point was that they ultimately won't leave, they will continue to work on bitcoin, most likely on whichever version winds up winning. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:55:04
If s2x does win this battle, what would Blockstream/core do? 
It doesn't seem practically or logistically possible that they would just give up on bitcoin. 
Sure, the unpaid open source volunteer type programmers may leave for ideological reasons. 
But I just don't see a majority of the paid programmers, whose livelihoods depend on it could just leave their jobs. I don't see how companies who are setup for bitcoin development and have investors who've put a lot of money towards bitcoin development would just give up on it.
This looks like a classic game of chicken where the main tactic is to convince your opponent that if I don't win, thermonuclear war ensues, while knowing that even if they lose, they really can't just blow it all up.
I wish all the sides of the bitcoin community would compromise instead of going with the nuclear option.
