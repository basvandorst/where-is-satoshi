Lightning network wont be successful without the big banks controlling the nodes. I think it was stealhily designed by the bl0ckstreeemmm team to just 'accidently happen' in a few years from now

I think the commonwealth bank will be a liquidity hub for the lightning network within 5 years

Blockstream (funded by bankers) will make sure that bitcoin is number 1 in 2020. You will all be making excuses by that time.

I excluded out of protest when i was paying 60 au dollars to move to a new wallet. Everybody was saying that the mempool was fine, or making excuses or telling lies. I said 'never again will i buy btc' when coinspot finally approved my account and i could be alts with fiat directly

Its impossible for bitcoin to be hinting at anything. They are acting like its human and its whispering or something.
