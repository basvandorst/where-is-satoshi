They can remove him arbitrarily, it's just that they'd need 2/3's of the board. 
Section 5.16 (c) Removal Without Cause. Any director may be removed without cause at a meeting called for that purpose by the Board of Directors. The director may be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the directors then in office.

It doesn't look like the Bitcoin Foundation can arbitrarily revoke anyone's membership. Relevant section of their bylaws, [Section 3.6(b)](

I don't know how inclined he would be to give up his board seat, given that he's proven willing to throw bitcoin itself under the bus to try to take the heat off of his own incompetence. 
Charlie Shrem did the admirable thing of resigning almost immediately after his release on bail in order to not drag his organization into his own trouble. See ["What Happens When a Board Member Gets Arrested?"](

See [my comments]( in the other thread about what's required to remove someone from the board, etc. 
tl;dr Bitcoin Foundation board of directors has to give 30 days notice to remove someone's membership (Mt. Gox Gold industry membership, Inputs.io Silver industry membership) 
2/3rds vote required to remove a sitting director "without cause"

How stringent should the standard be, and is there any precedent with other similar organizations to draw from?

I think they're still ok to remove him from his board seat. If I understand correctly, Section 3 is dealing with membership only, so if they wanted to remove his "Founding Member" status it would have to be "for cause" but his status as a board member is not related to his status as a founding member (he holds an "industry seat" on the board).
At least I hope that's the case.

In the spirit of nerdery, [their bylaws]( are available on GitHub, where people can also submit pull requests for alterations. 
Section 3.6 (b) address the process of a removing member, which in this case would pertain to Mt. Gox's Gold industry membership status with the Bitcoin Foundation. P.S. this is also the only way to deal with Inputs.io
Section 5.16 deals with removing members of the Board.

They're bound to their own bylaws, see [my comment below]( for how to kick them off.

A response that clearly outlines what someone would need to do to initiate a positive change? What is this madness? Anyone care to take a bet that the most vocal critics will choose to whine about someone else not doing it rather than taking action themselves? +all verify

There's a [thread over in the Bitcoin Foundation forum]( where members can submit agenda items for the next board meeting. If you are a member, or you know a member, that might be a good place to put some heat.

Article is accurate. Vessenes originally held two posts, Executive Director and Chairman of the Board(+Treasurer). He only ceded the Executive Director position to Matonis, and retained the Chairmanship.

Fun Fact: The original witness list for Panel II was Paul Smocer(yup, saw him today) Sarah Jane Hughes(yup, saw her today) Tony Gallippi(yup, saw him too) and the notably absent Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs. I counted four people on Panel II, one of whom wasn't Chris. You do the math.

Hey thanks! Quite a pleasant surprise after being away. You're a class act.
