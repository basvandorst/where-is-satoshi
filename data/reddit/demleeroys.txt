That's a real interesting idea, but I can think of two potential problems:
1) Graffiti is still illegal, and Bitcoin is not anonymous. With some effort, police could trace that address to the artist/vandal. It's another question of how well it could hold up as evidence in court.
2) Others could hijack or subvert the QR code. This also prompts the question of how the QR could would be implemented. Actually spraypainting a QR code seems extremely difficult, yet might be considered a form of art in itself (edit: I realized that people have already been stenciling QR codes for a while.) Other options might include stickers or something. In both cases, other individuals could add their own QR codes and make it look like it's the genuine address.

Nothing wrong with evangelizing Bitcoin is real life, but being condescending about it is not doing anyone any favors.

Today is a great day to learn how to be a grown up. The first lesson is that other grown ups are not always right. What the principal did was wrong. You need to stand up for yourself and get back what is rightfully yours. Try and enlist the help of your parents. Establish sound arguments about how/why the principal is wrong. If possible, find some technical way to get control over your wallet. Then once you have rub it in your principal's face.

No business license and accepting Bitcoin? Sounds like a Libertarian dream come true.

Joe Weisenthal is a known contrarian writer who has written an article in the past called "Bitcoin Is a Joke." None of the points summarized from the article he references are fatal. In particular, the mining pool will adjust itself so it gets close to break even. Finally, to read the article he references, you have to register for the website. I wouldn't be surprised if FT paid Joe/BI to write this article.

This brings a tear to my libertarian eye...

I left the Bitcoin game back in 2011 and forgot about my holdings. I got back into it and was worried I might not be able to recover my bitcoins. But then I logged back into Mt Gox and it's all cool. So does having a Mt Gox account make having a desktop wallet superfluous?

"Bitcoin is a form of digital currency. It's security is based on encrypted peep-to-peer networks, and **only 21 million bitcoins will ever be in circulation, so they are scarce.**"

I'm glad the most used word is "bitcoin." Shows we're really staying on topic.

Dag. Any other ASIC makers have something quicker? I suppose the silver lining is that the difficulty won't go up as much because of the limited supply...

So yea they decided not to *try* and mess with Bitcoin.

Oh and also if you have over 50% of a US bank note you can send it to em and they will give you credit.

Not easy! Think of this of a rough draft! 20 words or less is difficult too!
"Bitcoin is a form of digital currency. It's security is based on encrypted peep-to-peer networks, and it's scarcity is determined by built in deflation."
