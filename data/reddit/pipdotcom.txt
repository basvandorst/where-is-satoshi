The world financial system is as dangerously stretched today as it was at the peak of the last bubble but this time the authorities are caught in a "policy trap" with few defences left, a veteran central banker has warned.
Nine years of emergency money has had a string of perverse effects and lured emerging markets into debt dependency, without addressing the structural causes of the global disorder.
"All the market indicators right now look very similar to what we saw before the Lehman crisis, but the lesson has somehow been forgotten," said Professor William White, the Swiss-based head of the OECD's review board and ex-chief economist for the Bank for International Settlements.
 
White said disturbing evidence of credit degradation is emerging almost daily. The latest is the disclosure that distressed UK construction group Carillion quietly raised NZ$213m through German Schuldschein bonds.
South African retailer Steinhoff also tapped this obscure market, borrowing $1.4b.
Nine years of emergency money has had a string of perverse effects.
Schuldschein loans were once a feature of rock-solid lending to family Mittelstand companies in Germany.
The transformation of this corner of the market into a form of high-risk shadow banking shows how the lending system has been distorted by quantitative easing (QE) and negative interest rates.
White said there was an intoxicating optimism at the top of every unstable boom when people convince themselves that risk is fading, but that is when the worst mistakes are made.
Stress indicators were equally depressed in 2007 just before the storm broke.
This time central banks are holding a particularly ferocious tiger by the tail. Global debt ratios have surged by a further 51 percentage points of GDP since the Lehman crisis, reaching a record 327 per cent (IIF data).
This is a new phenomenon in economic history and can be tracked to QE liquidity leakage from the West, which flooded East Asia, Latin America, and other emerging markets, with a huge push from China pursuing its own venture.
"Central banks have been pouring more fuel on the fire," he told The Daily Telegraph, speaking before the World Economic Forum in Davos.
"Should regulators really be congratulating themselves that the system is now safer? Nobody knows what is going to happen when they unwind QE. The markets had better be very careful because there are a lot of fracture points out there," he said.
"Pharmaceutical companies are subject to laws forcing them to test for unintended consequences before they launch a drug, but central banks launched the huge social experiment of QE with carelessly little thought about the side-effects," he said.
The US Federal Reserve is already reversing bond purchases - ignoring warnings by former Fed chair Ben Bernanke - and will ratchet up the pace to US$50b a month this year.
It will lead to a surge in supply of US Treasury bonds just as the Trump Administration's tax and spending blitz pushes the US budget deficit toward US$1 trillion, and China and Japan trim Treasury holdings.
It has the makings of a perfect storm. At best, the implication is that yields on 10-year Treasuries - the world's benchmark price of money - will spike enough to send tremors through credit markets.
The edifice of inflated equity and asset markets is built on the premise that interest rates will remain pinned to the floor.
The latest stability report by the US Treasury's Office of Financial Research warned that a 100 basis point rate rise would slash US$1.2 trillion of value from the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index, with further losses once junk bonds, fixed-rate mortgages, and derivatives are included.
The global fall-out could be violent. Credit in dollars beyond US jurisdiction has risen fivefold in 15 years to over US$10 trillion. "This is a very big number. As soon as the world gets into trouble, a lot of people are going to have trouble servicing that dollar debt," said White. Borrowers would suffer the double shock of a rising dollar, and rising rates.
While banks now have high capital buffers, the risk has migrated: to investment funds concentrated in crowded trades. The share of equities traded in "dark pools" outside the exchanges has mushroomed to 33 per cent.
One worry is what will happen to "risk parity" funds when the inflation cycle turns. RBI Capital warned in its investor letter that these funds could lead to a "liquidity crash".
Deutsche Bank has advised clients to take out June 2018 "put" options on the S&amp;P 500 - a hedge against a market slide - arguing that the rally looks stretched and that risk parity funds will amplify any correction.
These funds manage risk by matching bonds and equities through dynamic weighting. The strategy worked during the "Goldilocks" phase of low inflation and rising stock markets. Both wings of the trade did well. The danger is that both could go wrong at the same.
Whether the inflation cycle is really turning, and how fast, is the elemental question of this bull market. What is clear is that the US has closed the output gap and is hitting capacity constraints.
The great disinflation of the last three decades was essentially a global "supply shock".
The opening-up of China and the fall of the Berlin Wall added 800m workers to the traded economy, depressing wages and unleashing a tsunami of cheap goods.
The "Amazon effect" of digital technology capped price rises. The demographics of the baby boom era played its part by boosting the global savings glut.
But there was another feature that is often neglected. Central banks intervened "asymmetrically" with each cycle, letting booms run but stepping in with stimulus to cushion busts. The BIS says one result was to keep insolvent "zombie" companies alive and block the creative destruction that leads to rising productivity.
"Everything could now go into reverse: the baby boomers are gone; China's working age population is falling; and zombie companies are going to be forced out of business at last as borrowing costs rise," said White.
While higher inflation is needed in one sense to right the global ship - since it lifts nominal GDP faster, and whittles down debt - the danger is that the shock of higher rates will hit first.
Central banks are now caught in a "debt trap". They cannot hold rates near zero as inflation pressures build, but they cannot easily raise rates either because it risks blowing up the system.
"It is frankly scary," said White.
The authorities may not yet have reached the end of the road but this strategy is clearly pregnant with danger.
Global finance has become so sensitive to monetary policy that central banks risk triggering a downturn long before they have built up the safety buffer of 400 to 500 basis points in interest rate cuts needed to fight recessions.
"We are running out of ammunition. I am afraid that at some point this is going to be resolved with a lot of debt defaults. And what did we do with the demographic dividend? We wasted it," he said.

the question for bitcoin is who will be right: institutions, who are short, or retail investors (especially those in Japan and South Korea) who remain fervently long. If the past 7 years - in which retail has consistently trounced "smart money" returns are any indication, bitcoin is about to soar as yet another major short squeeze develops in the coming weeks and months.

David Thomas-Jensen  cherazor65 • 13 hours ago 
I have calculated that over 80 percent of BTC hodlers have it at less than 300 a coin, and have had it for more than 2 years, they have profited in the last year and with the advent of ethereum and ICO's have most likely increased their holdings in this time, on the profits and backs of the last 2 years early adopters. because these 80 percent are owned by the pioneers before 2015. All this adds up to people who hodl have sell resistance to prices above 1000 a coin (resistance to dumping) and quite frankly with wall street have their eyes set on 3-15 trillion market cap, meaning they have sell resistance below 150k per BTC.
meanwhile if the definition of a cornered market is the control of 2/3 or a commodity supply, then though they are not united, as a psychological group they have btc cornered. do something to change their minds and watch out, otherwise, all wall st can do is push the cap.

Log–log plots are an alternative way of graphically examining the tail of a distribution using a random sample. **Caution has to be exercised** however as a log-log plot is necessary but insufficient evidence for a power law relationship, as many non power-law distributions will appear as straight lines on a log-log plot. 
Other ways of determining if a power law is in play are documented. Have you applied these other methods to the data?

Heat pumps work by taking the heat from the outside environment, concentrating it and releasing it into the inside environment. The power consumed is what is used to run the electric motor that drives the compressor. Typically about 3 times more heat than can be made by a heat pump than an electric heater for the same amount of electricity.

I trade currencies for a living. As we know btc is worth about USD 600 at the present time.. It seems to have stabilized in this region for a while now. I predict that the value will now go down when the USD goes up and go up when the USD goes down. Will btc be worth a million USD in the forseable future?. NO WAY. NO HOW. The only way btc will "Go to the moon" is if the USD goes to the Mariana Trench. Now that may well happen but I for one am not betting on that outcome happening anytime soon. I know this statement is not popular among btc fans(and I am one myself) however I haven't made a fair living out of currency trading by living in hopium.

At 8.30 eastern standard time the US non farm payroll data came out. All the currencies started jumping around as the us dollar was bought and sold off in a fairly random way. Normally a good NFP such as this would cause the dollar to go up but as an earlier indicator release the ADP suggested the NFP was going to be better than expected. So the result was sort of baked in. Bitcoin was not immune from this because lets face it for all intents and purposes it is a currency. Nothing to see here move on... Also the NFP is the largest and most watched financial news release (2nd friday in every month) that the currencies tend to jiggle around for 24 hours after the news comes out.

Yes I understand that you need to either memorize or store on paper your 12 word seed. Then on another computer I downloaded the Electrum   software with the view to testing the recovery process.
However at about that point things got a bit unclear. I know I am sounding a bit stupid but rather than muddle through it myself it would help if I saw a simple tutorial of the process. Perhaps others like myself would find that comforting as well.

But before I take my hard earned Fiat and convert to Bitcoin I want to be 100% certain I can recover my Bitcoins if I have my computer stolen, lost or destroyed by fire. I have chosen Electrum because of its supposed ease of recovery. However I like most non tech people want to be shown by experts how it is done,

Does that make my BTC held on my wallet more valuable because those BTC held in China are no longer in the ecosystem? In fact what the $%$# is going on?

With all due respect you could not be more incorrect. The bitcoin price will rise quite dramatically as the date of the debt ceiling approaches. The VIX index will climb above the 20 level and the hysteria in the financial news will reach fever pitch. The pattern will be  violent zig zags of price increase and substantial pull backs followed by greater price hikes. This will all terminate when all the parties hammer out an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. Upon which the BTC price will fall back reasonably far from the highs reached during the run-up to said agreement, but will still be much higher than it is now. I suggest we should take note of the price now (1177.09 bitstamp) and compare to price after the dust settles.

Yes. Values above 20 are considered to be total panic. You will note if you switch to 1 year chart the last two spikes above 20 were the Brexit vote and the US election. If you really want to see fear take a look back to 2009. It just about went off the chart. So for what its worth the VIX at 12.95 probably means that unless the VIX goes up more there probably isn't much more legs to this bitcoin price appreciation(this time)

I meet in a bank lobby or McDonalds. When selling I ask to see the cash first then I transfer BTC to their wallet. After 2 confirmations I collect the cash. I only will deal with the other party if they came alone. The app shows how long the other person has been on Local Trader. The longer the more reliable they are. Scammers on the app will have a rate that is too good to be true and will try to get you to send money to bank accounts or similar rather than meeting in person. I hope that helps.

Actually a high hash rate tends to depress the price. Think about it. When a miner finally finds a block they have spent an absolute fortune in electricity to do so. They have to dump a pile of BTC on the market to cover their expenses. ASAP. That's what all those deep red candles are. God knows what is going to happen when the halvening comes. Actually I hope most of the idiots go broke and allow the price to appreciate. We don't actually need so many wasters on the network to make it function reliably.

Those big green candles are caused by institutional buyers. Every time there is a big pump the mempool stays small. My inference is that the general herd has not jumped in and caused the spike but some deep pocketed company has bought up a few million dollars worth or more in one hit.

My 2 cents on this issue. I only used Coinomi once. That was to claim my Bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold coins so that I could swap to BTC. First I created a new wallet on Mycelium and moved my BTC to said wallet. Then I entered my original seed into coinomi to get access to the shit coins I wanted. But this is the weird thing that happened. I remember creating a new coinomi wallet and started to enter my old seed and it already had every word of my seed in memory??? It kept a bloody text file somewhere in its memory of my entire seed. I deleted that piece of shit straight away. I also reset my phone to factory and reloaded Mycelium. I will never trust another wallet again.

I am really trying to understand how it feels to put your entire life savings into bitcoin at 17,000 usd.

Any how I am off for a three month holiday in Thailand in about 2 weeks time. Knowing my luck I will mistime buying at the bottom and will feel such a fool.

I agree with you 100%. If someone wants to start buying BTC, then getting one or two hundred dollars worth of BTC is the most common way to start. Using Mycelium Local Trader is the way I started and it worked really well for me. Once I felt comfortable with that I bought amounts in the region of about a thousand dollars at a time. Would I use Local Trader to buy a million dollars worth? No don't be crazy. Nowadays I use Bitstamp for buying significant amounts.(and trading)
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:35:19
You are totally correct, however the lower valued transactions will be moved on second layers and only transacted on the first layer when aggregated, paying the appropriate fee when settled.
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:40:18
Its a shame that the fee is not in proportion to the actual BTC value being transacted. That would sort it out.

Yeah but the profitability is extremely low. They have no choice but to dump their coins on the market as soon as the price makes a small pump. They have big overheads to pay. If you look back at the 2017 pump, the big one up to 20000 usd the profit factor was huge for miners. They could hold their coins back and sell when the price went up higher. Not now. Soon as they mine some, onto the market. Volatility is being depressed as a result. Edit: Although that's not actually bad for the ecosystem in the long run. It means that smaller players can buy BTC at cheaper rates than would otherwise be the case. More adoption wider base....

What's the chance that lightning network becomes so good that in effect it makes bitcoin security advantages redundant. So that when the last bitcoin is mined and off chain coins are as safe as on chain coins then the bitcoin blockchain and miners and associated costs could be retired and the fully developed lightening network sails on forever alone...

How about this for an idea. The USA makes an offer to the Venezuelan people to overthrow their completely useless government and in return the USA will incorporate Venezuela into the United States as a self governing territory (similar to Puerto Rico). What the Venezuelans will get is a temporary allowance in US dollars and emergency relief supplies and the USA gets the oil eventually. The proceeds (after Exon etc has their cuts will rebuild their shattered economy). Disclaimer: I am neither affiliated with any oil company nor  a citizen of the USA.

Mycelium used to have an IOS app as well. However they stopped supporting it a while back. Therefore I could not recommend it as a totally secure wallet as the android version. However the only part you need to achieve your goal of finding sellers to buy bitcoin from, is the local trader function. Perhaps that might be available in the IOS version. Then just use the wallet that is best for IOS for transactions/hodling. I believe that the bread wallet is most recommended. (BRD)

@_date: 2019-06-01 04:46:02
Not quite true. When you first memorise a set of words it is Physically written to a sector of your brain. By going through a memory retention system that encourages different parts of the brain to store the same information builds in a certain level of redundancy.(edit typo)

Basically what happens is the words lose their meaning and become a set of electrical impulses that your mouth retrieves to fulfill your request. Once the memory has been fixed this automatic response is from a different sector of your brain. No logic or emotion. More like a complete article than 12 hesitant words. Like a sort of song in your head.

Bitcoin takes powers from the central actors and returns it to merchants and consumers, savers and borrowers. Bitcoin brings back some pseudonymity in the transactions, and can be irrevocably traded like cash. And finally, it points a way towards a single currency – it is a bug, not a feature, that we have multiple global currencies with exchangers and transaction fees in between.

Sure there is moderation on this sub. Two of my posts disappeared without trace.
This one(far too emotional)
Since the inception of the original bitcoin to the ones minted this very day Bitcoin has never failed us. Now is the time when it is under threat by other actors (who I will not even give the dignity to name), we the people trust Bitcoin to grow in value and above all be safe from those who wish to destroy it by splitting the chain. Because mark my words if there becomes 2 chains the value of bitcoin will plummet. There will be no winners at all. The enormous faith that all the stakeholders in this most grand project will be irrevocably destroyed. The grand project, this most worthy project will be lost. I call on everyone at this oh so crucial time to get behind the One and Only BITCOIN and save the day!!
And this one(far too scary and off topic)
In all my years following news events globally, I have never seen such a clear and convincing argument that a new (and final) Korean war is about to start. 1:North Korean provocation. 2:Nearly total loss of patience from USA . 3:China/Russia prepared to sit on its hands 4:Now before North Korea can reliably launch an ICBM 5:Sabre rattling noises from USA and North Korea 6:100 day Donald 7:Military build up along the peninsula(sea,air land)
Why post on this thread? Frickin obvious what it would do to the price of BTC.
Personally I would rather the price of BTC went to zero before this hideous thing happened.( Estimated 250,000 South Koreans dead in the first 48 hrs of artillery strikes alone.)
But what would the price shoot up to??)

For the first time in a very long time the price of Bitcoin and it's market dominance is correlated. 54% dominance and good steady price appreciation. That only has one interpretation. BTC is considered to be the one true decentralised POW coin AND the disappointing lesser chains are slowly being phased out. Good bye shitcoins…

Look on the bright side of it all, The price made 20,000 USD before dropping all the way down to the high 6,000's and the bottom could be much lower, everybody who told you its a bubble don't buy now, is basically laughing at you for ignoring their advice, thankfully not too many of you borrowed against your credit card to buy in at the ATH. I believe that some of those credit card companies charge 20% plus in interest. You now know that experts on reddit are full of shit with their charts and price predictions and even though they call this a community, you are basically all on your own in your own financial hell. But look on the bright side because now that reality has made itself known to you in such a dramatic fashion you can make yourselves feel better by downvoting this post. Oh how that will make me feel bad. Ha Ha

A guy called John goes to see the doctor, "Doc I have been sleeping with heaps of Asian hookers er um and other things, anyhow my dick has gone all pussie and smells terrible." The doctor takes a quick look from a safe distance. "Oh it looks like you have the Manchurian clap, we will have to amputate, let me warn you it won't be cheap about 2 bitcoins." John screams "No way, that babies going to be the main course for lunch by 2020. I am going to seek a second opinion" John rushes of to consult with an Asian doctor, after all it's their bloody disease they should have more experience. The Asian doctor looks at John's dick and says(in a typical Asian accent) "Yep you got the Manchurian clap for sure, I am sorry we can't do anything for you, that will be 1 BTC please" John is crestfallen but decides to look on the bright side " you only charge 1BTC, my American doctor was going to charge me 2 BTC to have my dick amputated, why are you so cheap?" The Asian doctor replies" Those American doctors always charge too much, You don't have to get it amputated, it will fall off by itself in 2 weeks!!"

New Zealand (used to). Cash is different. Our buyers were mainly mon and pop investors using the equity in their existing properties to get an equity bond in lieu of a 10% deposit while the properties were under construction. Age was indeed a factor before the bond company would grant them a development bond, they had to jump through lots of hoops. At the time I was working the market New Zealanders were equity rich because of a huge run up in the value of their properties but cash poor, with few having a spare 30 to 40 k sitting around to give to a developer for 2 or 3 years waiting around for their concrete steel and glass box somewhere up there in the sky to be finished. Believe me it was a hard sell.

Probably the best way for Bitcoin and a good government to co-exist and still have the money to run essential Governmental services is to get their entire income in Bitcoin , entirely from a GST on goods and services set at approximately 20%. That rate gives you free medical, well funded ie (incorruptible Police), and a very small defence force.  No other taxes of any sort are permitted. The people vote for the GST levy amount yearly? Might also get few roads and bridges thrown in. What else does a damn government need?

I am speaking from experience. The New Zealand government tries not to get to involved in our lives. They fail miserably but we can basically do what we like. Taxes are there for sure but really simple. And if your listening IRD policy maker drop all income and business tax and raise GST to the level required to fund the whole shebang, We would all be far better off.  Edit: And as a plus the poor bloody Tourists will end up paying more to the government coffers for the unique NZ experience.

It's really easy to setup and secure. I am sick of reading about poor souls that have lost all their coins on Web based wallets, PC wallets or had them stolen from/by exchanges.

Actually I guaranteed there will be profit taking at $5000. I stand by that statement 100%. The part that is notoriously difficult to predict is where you should put your buy order in for the dip.

OK you don't understand how the Deep Cold Storage Works. Because it is hierarchical deterministic wallet you only need to input your seed to recover your keys and the full balance is recovered. In the cold storage scenario you have Mycelium installed on your wallet but you do not input your keys at installation. Go to the "Spend from cold storage option" and you then one time only input your seed to spend some or all of the balance. When you finish the data is wiped and you are back to any empty wallet.

I understand that in most situations that a pull request (via credit card) from your service supplier is fine. But imagine if Bitcoin allowed a pull request that is absolutely irreversible.

For example I could send them to a wallet I control and if I wanted to only I could steal my own coin. But until I added a bit of post split dust my coins will always be at risk. But how did the recipient get my private keys to authorise the transaction on the second chain?

Actually for a while I had mycelium uninstalled and when I needed to spend or receive coins I reinstalled from the play store and from memory inputted my 12 word seed. When I finished my transaction I uninstalled Mycelium. I then learned about deep cold storage where I had to input my 12 word seed to get access to my coins. I believe from what you kind and obviously clever techies have told me that is 100% safe. The 12 words are not stored on the phone and the balance showing in the wallet is zero. In fact I am going to do that right now.

Mycelium marketplace is awesome. I only trade for cash, in person, face to face and no other wallet finds me buyers or sellers like mycelium marketplace does. If I am in Thailand for instance I can meet up with a buyer or seller in Bangkok or Pattaya and get some Thai baht spending money same day. Until another wallet offers such a useful service I will stick with Mycelium.

To prove this in court the Agent would have to produce the Wallet and Keys (of said transactions)and show them being in possession of the defendant. If the defendant kept his wallet un hackable by the officer then they could not track back to his wallet. Therefore he would have a plausible defence. For example he could take the cash, make a call to an associate, transfer bitcoins to purchaser or just pull coins out of deep storage from mycelium.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:34:07
At the current rate of adoption by new people coming into the ecosystem as buyers a substantial percentage of these people will become business owners and they will definitely gladly accept bitcoin alongside cash and eventually will prefery bitcoin as it is clearly a better store of wealth.

Thanks for that. The federal reserve guy sounds interesting. However they look more like Big Business rather than Govt policy makers. The Government would like to shut down bitcoin purely because it threatens their control over the money supply. But they are also hampered from within because a percentage of them are hodlers too. But if they get control of the code they can run it according to their terms.

I was reading that they intend to confiscate white owned farmland and give it to the black population. Without compensation. That was a total recipe for disaster in Zimbabwe. I really fear for the people of South Africa black or white. The result of this will be mass starvation. The reason being the people who are given these farms are always cronies of the people in power. The farms inevitably fail due to incompetence and the country will not be able to feed itself.

Read the whole thing (hardly an endorsement.)
The meeting was attended by Presidential Aide Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, Central Bank Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova and QIWI CEO Sergei Solonin.
* * *
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues, 
Today, I propose addressing a topic that is relevant not only for our country, not only for Russia, but is probably becoming relevant also for the rest of the world.
I am referring to introducing digital technology in the financial, banking sphere, and using innovative financial instruments.
Modern technology in the banking sphere certainly opens up new opportunities for organisations and citizens, making business activity and everyday life more convenient.
As is known, virtual currencies, also known as cryptocurrencies, are becoming or have already become very popular; in certain countries they are becoming or have already become legal tender, as well as an investment asset.
I would like to draw your attention to the need to use the advantages that are offered by new technological solutions in the banking sphere.
That said, the use of cryptocurrencies also carries serious risks. I know the Central Bank’s position; I have discussed this topic with the Governor on several occasions. 
First and foremost, this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains, tax evasion and even financing of terrorism, not to mention the proliferation scams to which ordinary people can fall victim.
Cryptocurrencies are issued by an unrestricted circle of anonymous entities. Therefore, buyers of cryptocurrencies may be involved in illegal activity. 
In addition, there is no security for cryptocurrencies. If the system breaks down or, as it is trendy to say today, if there is a bubble, there will be no entity legally responsible for that. This is a serious matter that we should bear in mind when discussing this topic.
As is known, many countries are looking for ways of regulating the circulation of cryptocurrencies and are beginning to create the necessary legislative framework, a legislative regulatory system.
We need – based on international experience – to build a regulatory environment that will make it possible to codify relations in this sphere, reliably protect the interests of citizens, businesses and the state and provide legal guarantees for using innovative financial instruments. 
I would like once again to draw your attention to the need to use the advantages that are offered by new technological solutions in the banking sphere.
At the same time it is important not to create unnecessary barriers, of course, but rather to provide essential conditions for advancing and upgrading the national financial system. 
Bearing all these various aspects of the problem in mind, let us discuss this topic today.

I live in New Zealand. Bitcoin adoption is almost ZERO. Why? Because I can transfer money from my bank account to anyone elses bank account at any bank within 60 minutes with almost no fees. Almost nobody carries cash because every single business has an eftpos machine that you can buy all your goods even a frigin car with from your eftpos card. Nobody is allowed to be denied a bank account even if you are the most absolute shadiest criminal, you just won't get credit. I love bitcoin but NZ forget it.

Good advice. I pretty much only trade trend reversal myself. Large leverage trading is fine as long as you don't use up your margin by trading too large a position. In forex I rarely end up going below 7000% margin level. Pretty conservative and hard to rek yourself with that type of trade level.

Of course the ideal and inevitable answer is to be able to spend bitcoins everywhere, however you can't force people to take them. Bitcoin ATM's will help with adoption. The more in your face bitcoin becomes, the more acceptable it becomes. Look at it as a stopgap measure during this increase in adoption phase. This is a long journey we are on, not a sprint.

Put that $10,000 into BTC. Bitcoin is trading at $6727.65. Before everyone goes batshit and condemns this call. Lets let time be the ultimate judge. Call me any horrible name you like if it is not worth $20,000 by end of year. Cash out then and make some serious gains, although when it reaches those lofty heights again cash out would make more sense at 25k to 30k

Catching a falling knife only has meaning when you are trading on margin. If you open your position and the trade goes deeply against you will be required to add more margin or you get a margin call and lose money. In the OP's case, he will always have one sixth of a bitcoin, no matter what happens. He will win in the end I guarantee.

I saw a british programme once about an experiment on mass hypnosis(sort of). What the producers did was put a statue of a dog in a public park and introduced a fake rumour on social media that anybody who rubbed the dog was finding good fortune. Before long more and more people started rubbing the dog. They then started to interview the participants and the results were very interesting. Basically their "Luck" changed for the better. But this next part was more interesting again. One of the villagers was well known for his bad luck. This poor guy failed at everything. He had been failing for so long that he truly believed he was cursed. The TV crew decided to experiment on him, by setting up situations where he could find money, meet a beautiful girl, save someone from tragedy etc. He basically self sabotaged all the opportunities that were set up for him. His world view sabotaged his happiness. Anyhow they managed to get him to rub the dog and it all changed for him from that point in time. You basically sound like that "Unlucky" chap. I hope you find your personal "Lucky Dog" but I expect it resides within you, you just have to find it.

They don't charge interest. The broker makes money on the spread(The difference between the buy/sell price) and if you get rekt. Brokers will send the trade off to their liquidity providers if they think you know what you are doing so the liquidity providers cover your profits, however if the broker thinks (by your track record) that you are a useless trader they take the trade on themselves and when you lose they themselves get ALL the profit.

This is how you remember a 12 word seed. It is totally easy. I now can spit mine out if I had to in approximately  6 seconds.
1: Break your seed into 4 blocks of 3 words in the order that they come.
2:Start to commit to memory the first 3 words.(say it very quietly to yourself(best just inside your brain)
3:A little bit later do the same for the 2nd set of three words.
4:A little bit later do the same for the 3rd set of three words.
5:A little bit later do the same for the 4th set of three words.
Oh look you have NEARLY committed to permanent memory the 12 words in the order that will recreate your beautiful bittys.
And when you can effortlessly spit the goddam 12 words out in under 4 seconds you have finally got it. I hope that works for you too.
Actually I have a theory how memory works. Every time you pull from memory something for a reason it puts a copy back in a different part of your brain. The more times you pull it out to use it the more copies it makes. Now if some of them aren't exactly right it doesn't matter because the ones that count will be the majority of the little buggers. The ones that actually work. Strangely enough it acts in a similar way to the blockchain.

Coming from a forex trading background. Currencies normally trade sideways for 90% of the time. Trends for the remaining 10%. Of course trading currencies(I mean traditional pairs like EUR/USD or AUD/USD) normally at least one of the 7 majors is trending. Now crypto is similar most of the time it is range bound then off it goes on a trend. However it is very hard to find a trending crypto while the rest are range bound as they all follow BTC's lead. So you have to recognise when they are range bound and trade accordingly. (Whew that was a lot of typing)

In one word "Liquidity"
Bitcoin can be exchanged for cash in so any ways. Far more than any altcoin will ever be. Every day more and more ways are created for people to purchase bitcoins for cash and also cash them out. Altcoins rely on bitcoin as the intermediary. How many exhanges are fighting over themselves to exchange your altcoins for cash?
Edit: The number of industries that have been built around bitcoin is astounding, tumblers,remitances, online shopping just to name a few. No this horse has well and truly bolted and no other altcoin has a chance of reigning her in.

That's true. However I plan on keeping going with forex for a few years and build up a track record. If I can get it up to 10% growth per month with a relatively low drawdown, you can make a good living trading other peoples accounts. You just need to build up a good long track record. Already had a couple of inquiries but I am happy to potter along just for myself. I used to code trading bots on MT4. However I didn't have enough patience back them to run them long enough to see if they were gong to be profitable. Always tinkering and changing them and deleting them and getting pissed off with paying for the Forex server to run them 24 hrs on. Anyhow once I realized that a longer time frame (Daily or weekly) charts suited my personality better, I in turn became a better trader. Don't need bots for longer frame charts, just pending orders. Haven't done a market order in ages.

A new support group is being launched to help those people who sold all their BTC to buy BCH. With the total combined value of the two new BCH alt coins now worth LESS than 200usd, it is an appropriate time to offer our help with any negative feelings that you might be having. For example if someone started out with say 5 bitcoins valued at todays prices of about 17,000usd in total minus the 980usd your Altcoin is now worth(in total) a net loss of $16,020. Although 16,020USD lost is small potatoes to some of us, for others this could smart a little. For your own mental health please feel free to tell us your own personal experiences. We particularly wish to help those who have lost much much more than that. Tell the community how you made that call and if you perhaps blame any body for this? I am sure the community will rally around and give you much needed support. Let it all out, I guarantee you will feel much better...
