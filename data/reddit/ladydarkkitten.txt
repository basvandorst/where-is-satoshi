Better yet get an electric bike, or a 49cc motorized bike. Better than the bus in warm weather an you can still take the bus when its shitty outside.

If you transfer partial finds from a paper wallet the remainder goes into what is called a change address. You would then have to check blockchain.info to find out the change address. Paper wallets are really best for storage of your BTC, they aren't intended to be spending wallets. That's what your bitcoin client is for.

That can happen with ANY currency. He could have done the same with cash. Thats just a case of dude being a douche not a problem with the currency its self.

Sending money to a paper wallet works just like any other wallet. Just send it and check blockchain.info to make sure the transaction processed. I have 6 paper walletsthey all worked like a champ!
As for hardware wallets I'm under the impression that they are similar in function to online wallets (just more secure) or a standard wallet in the desktop programs. 
Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
