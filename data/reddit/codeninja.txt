What is the benefit to me running this node? I'm sorry I'm new to this, and I don't know much about it.

Hey I traded 5 Bitcoin worth a shit coin stock over the last couple of weeks. Don't knock it till you play it.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:43:58
Do report back!...  sometime next year when you sync.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:56
My bot bought a ton of btc and ltc during the dip... sold off for a 25% gain. 
Got any more of those cheap BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:58:41
Hmm, my wallet has room.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:23:35
I just bought 0.05btc, and I'm hearing slot about this futures market stuff that I don't fully understand... what am I in for and what should I watch out for?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:59
I love youre positivity. It's bullshit and it won't work for me... but never lose that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:20:27
Bought $1000 @ $19.5k. Hodl me!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:48
Argued with my wife for months to buy. Finally get approval to buy $1000 at $19,400. Fuck me indeed.
Edit: Ok, this blew up and even got media coverage... so let me just say that the decision to buy at this time was a joint decision. As it should be, I think, for any large purchase. (we also went pretty hard into Litecoin ($3k @ 150) which is still doing well). One should never invest money one is not willing to lose... and neither did we. 
HODL strong. HODL long. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:41:22
I actually think I can make this argument. :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:04:06
I'll just pay the taxes, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:20
That's why I didn't buy it a thousand. And that's also why I didn't buy it but it broke 5000 and when it was breaking 7500 and then it broke 10,000 and then I'm like oh my God maybe this is not going to stop. Well, I can say officially it stopped. And now is the time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:56:37
Sell 100 and pay off my families debts. Set my parents and kids up nice with a trust. 
Sell 100 and donate to 10 charities.
Diversify 300 to other long term investments.
 Hold the remainder until the $100k threshhold.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:34
I don't think anyone is insinuating that I should go behind her back to spend more than the agreed upon value. But in buying so low the average cost per coin would actually go down... so that might be a conversation we could have :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:09:18
Grandious if acknowledged. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:48:49
Hodl my brother! I'm strong / trapped with you.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:06:44
Just in time it seems

Create a gdax account (owned by coinbase) and the in gdax transfer your balances from your coinbase account.  Then from g dax you can send your coins to any other wallet sans ludicrous fees
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:44:45
I told her, quartly updates only.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:40:21
I should have, the LTC transfer I did was nearly instant and only had $4.50 in fees. The BTC transfer will have $40 in fees to transfer $100 and take weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:00:18
It's our savings. Our kids. Our family's money. That's not how a healthy relationship works son.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:43:22
Yes... Because when you make a major purchase you talk to your spouse about it because it's a joint decision... ya dick.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:10:36
After months of watching, I finally convinced the wife and we dove in with a $1000 purchase... at $19.5k.
I'm right there with you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:29
Ok... ok. But as a new guy in the market where should I go?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:29:41
Awesome... my wife will be thrilled :)
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:34:38
I've been hodling since $17k... when do I sell for the lambo?
@_date: 2019-11-16 23:07:03
At which time I buy 10btc and throw it in a hardware wallet and wait .
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:38:52
My portfolio is down 450% since December. That feels pretty crashy.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:49:29
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:33:32
Put a reminder in my phone to remind me in 1 year that my wife was wrong in front of my wife and show her the price.
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:52:11
1% handling fee
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:23:32
$9,500 more then I'll break even!! Whhoooo
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:51:37
Cash. Out.
Send it to a hardware wallet and take yourself in a tiny island off the coast of wherever the fuck you want.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:12:45
First Time?
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:02:46
That is exactly what I said to the guy who offered me 100 bff for  $200 several many years ago..
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:23:55
I'll take that bet!
