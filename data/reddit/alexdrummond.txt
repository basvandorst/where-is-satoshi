Genuinely surprised by the positive and even interested tone from the federal reserve bank president.
Cautious sure, but anything else would be irresponsible. I think he wants to appear on the right side of history.

Call me a crazy optimist, but I see 1 bit as 1 usd in 2030 due to the complete failure of the petrodollar and a carbon buyback tied to bitcoin.

A positive and constructive discussion.

Wouldn't a destabilization of fiat be good for bitcoin ?

I stream twice a week, mostly sci fi spaceships, environments and weapon design. I noticed the paypal fees and third party transfer fees are pretty crazy for people that only want to tip a dollar or less.

Thanks man :) i have been talking up bitcoin to my creative industry mates, the instant transfer time is a big factor.

I sell in 30 years if I have to, or I don't sell because money has shed its skin to crypto and I and my grand children are comfortably well off, actually 28 years now.

Does this emply that the  chinese government may start stockpiling bitcoin ? Time to double down ?
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:27:35
Because it is good to give extra incentive to use a new payment medium. Also the value of bitcoin in my opinion will be around 20k range in 4 years. I am not cashing out the coins I make from work, I will spend them as currency or to upgrade my machine. 
Glad you dig my work cheers.

I can hop on skype, I threw a skype button on my website to be easy to add.
Ha, this is infact the perfect example for early adoption of bitcoin for small business.

Hey that's cool, I have a specialised job inside of a specialised field. 
The majority of clients I have are producers under a deadline that need something concepted that afternoon, or studio overflow situations where a large amount of assets need to be concepted and designed that are then outsourced to other companies to get made.
The key in these situations is to get the ball rolling quickly with clients, If there were some magical currency that changes hands instantly and is relatively secure that would be a game chang... I'm describing bitcoin.

Since opening the door to clients outside the games industry I have worked with circuit board manufacturers, card game/board game designers, beer companies, car companies, weapon manufacturers.
I have been paying lots of paypal fees and that is another reason to look for alternatives.

Sent you a PM, I am actually looking forward to putting BTC on an invoice.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:17:52
I am of the same mind. I think we are in "the good old days" where bitcoin was under $1,000 USD.

I can keep the time available for the illustration no worries. Or you can licence something I have allready done if it is easier. Most of my work is unlicenced on my portfolio and blog. A great deal of my client work is all confidential and will likely never see the light of day.

I like hearing about people doing well, congrats and best of luck with what comes next. Pay your taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:35:00
Ah sorry I had no idea that existed.

I think a lot of people sell to secure their initial investment negating some risk before re-investing.
