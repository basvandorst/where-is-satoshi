It's not about the absolute values, it's about the difference. In this bear market, don't be greedy. Sell whenever you're up 3-4%, let the whales grab an additional % if they want to, wait for the ineluctable 3-5% dump that follows a few hours/days later, buy back and repeat. You'll make 3-4% at least once a week, just trailing the whales.
Hodling right in the start/middle of a bear market does not make any sense.

Jesus. If you bought 1 BTC at 6k in november, your potential gains were 13k mid-December, 10k early January, 5k early March, 3.5k early May, 2k late July and only 1k lately.
You may still be in the money, but there is indeed less and less gains to be had over time. Quantitatively, your 13k potential gains have been torn down since when you bought and are now only about 8% of the maximum potential gains (1k/13k).
In other words, you would have gained much much more selling your bitcoin at the top **or basically at any point ever since** except on two occasions, early-Feb and mid-June.

@_date: 2018-08-09 14:50:20
That's... not how it works at all in the real world. Either you declared that money on a tax form and the government knows about it (and can seize it), or you did not declare those assets, thereby committing fraud, and your government can come and force you to render it and/or put you in jail should you refuse to do so.
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:39:12
Well, that was pretty dumb 
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:46:43
You do not get to decide whether "we" are done with anything, though.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:42:45
Sigh. And with what money did you buy those coins of gold/bitcoin, I wonder?
Might it be with money you earned legally? If so, you declared it and the government knows about it. Is it with money that you did not declare? Then you're committing fraud.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:36:35
You seem to be operating under some kind of delusion that you can legally earn a substantial sum of money without declaring it, then convert it into bitcoin and use it at will without any interference from the government. That's not how it works in the real world. There are strict laws against tax fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.
For the record, that's what I was replying to:


Two possibilities here. Either that money is accounted for (the government knows you earned it at some point in time through your taxes), or it is not accounted for. If it is accounted for, it's an integral part of your financial profile and the government can seize it should you break laws. If it is not accounted for, you are thereby committing tax evasion, money laundering, fraud or whatever the crime is in your country, and your government can come to your house in a lesser mood. And they can and will still seize the account.
If you say to the investigators that you don't have that money anymore, they will demand you prove it's gone. If you cannot or will not prove that to them in a satisfactory manner, they will put you in a cage. It is that simple. Believing otherwise is ridiculous. Think of your bitcoin account as a foreign bank account. Laws don't cease to apply to you because you externalize your bank accounts, lol.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:29:11
And? The government can compell you to give the key up and put you in a tiny cage if you say you "cannot remember"... how is it better?

What good is it if you can't spend it at any regulated merchant's, and if you can't turn it back into fiat at any regulated exchange?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:56:18
Yes, and what prevents Bitcoin to get in the same situation?
Say you have some BTC, acquired legally, of course (you're a law-complying citizen, right?). Then the state becomes facist and you try to move away.
At the border check, you are asked your ID and an automated verification is instantly made on your name at all registered exchanges + payment processors (Visa, Stripe, maybe your bank, etc.).
Now the state has your address and can force you to reveal the keys or imprison you for "not remembering it"/"having lost it".
Say you have never changed anything at an exchange but were "given" those millions in BTC from a "friend". You reported that exceptional income when filing your taxes, which the state has, and now you are asked what became of that money. Once again, you are jailed if you don't remember where the money went or can't aswer the reasonable (or unreasonable, after all they are facist) request of the list of transactions emanating from the account that received the money.
Say you're not a law-complying citizen and acquired those millions in BTC illegally. There might be an inquiry on you by the state (maybe it even started before the state went facist), and the automated check at the border might flag you for being watched/wanted. You wouldn't know before the fact, of course, however it's still questioning/jail time again.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:04:18
Yup. Say a while ago, after such and such hacking/robbery, the state sprayed red paint into a bag of stolen coins. Now they force exchanges to check each and every bitcoin they see passing through for red paint. If the exchange sees red paint on a bitcoin, then that exact bitcoin is definitely not interchangeable with any other: it's tainted.
It does not matter whether the original stolen bitcoin was mixed with others at any point before reaching the exchange, because by the very definition of the network it sprays red paint all over other coins it's mixed with, so that they themselves become tainted. 
Also the red paint never dries and it's self-regenerating so there's always some to spray.
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:45:13
No. See, any state can:
1) maintain a list of tainted transactions that originate at a particular transaction and then propagate downwards
2) enforce at the edges of the network (exchanges are companies and must comply with regulations) that any bitcoin within a tainted chain of transactions be denied exchange to fiat

Definitely not, as each bitcoin is unique and traceable.
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:34:34
You *may* be able to do so, but even that is not exactly certain.
It all depends on the provenance of your bitcoin stash and the legality of your intentions, really. If you acquired those millions legally, then there is a trail linking them to your identity, you paid taxes on it, or will have to at some point, etc.
**In that respect, if your intentions are to act within the law of both countries, then moving your money from one country to another using bitcoin is no different from doing a basic bank transfer, or even no bank transfer at all just be at an international bank with offices in both countries and you're set.**
If however you acquired the bitcoin in a fraudulent manner, then it could be tainted *without you even knowing it*, and the mere action of trying to spend it at a regulated merchant's OR to store it at a regulated exchange to turn it into anything else will result in the merchant/exchange seizing it and reporting the attempt to authorities. Then, yes,  you'll be questioned.
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:12:42
There were credit card numbers, cvc and expiration dates.

Banning exchanges located in the European Union, the United States and Canada would almost immediately halt the development of Bitcoin as a platform for the whole Western world, as well as dry up the supply: individuals can no longer mine efficiently by themselves and there are almost no legal ecommerce platforms where you can pay in Bitcoin, therefore the only ones capable of owning Bitcoin would instantly be mining conglomerates (getting minted currency) and criminals (transacting with existing currency).
Also the price would drop to a low % of what it is right now, because the price reflects future use of the currency by mom &amp; pop shops (seller side) as well as moms and pops (buyer side).
