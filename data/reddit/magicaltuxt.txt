Unless someone does this - wait until XT mining power reaches +/- 50% mining power, deploys the remaining 25% temporarily just long enough than for one block to be mined and immediately scales back. What happens then?

But, didn't you read, they have been censored!

Right now no because they are just the same. But when they split - if they ever do - you will be able to. However either your BTCs or your BXTCs will probably have become worthless. Am I right?

Ah ah, but the rate is not the mostbimportant.

Okay now I get it. You explained it just below. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:16:32
Oh, sorry. Not for me.

Personally I think it is just a well-organized misinformation campaign that stands to benefit a few individuals or weaken the Bitcoin network.

Either you or I is confused. If you do not spend your Bitcoins now, assuming you have the primary key, after the fork, assuming it happens, that will become two entirely separate networks and you could spend your coins on network  and on network  separately. So far am I right? However if you do not have the primary key, assuming there is a fork and Bitcoin becomes worthless then your wallet provider could leave you with the Bitcoins and take all your BitcoinXT's away - after all they are just a Bitcoin wallet, isn't it?
