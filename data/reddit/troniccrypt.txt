Coinbase is pretty reliable to get you up and running. You can keep a cash balance and buy BTC and a few others when you want. 
Then if you want to trade alt coins you can open an account with Binance. Transfer the BTC, ETH, LTC from coinbase.

Brickstring just does not get enough coverage in the media. At last some recognition for Brickstring and  the crucial part it plays in the foundation of everything.

Can you elaborate on that? 
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:59:31
Thanks for the information, what you say is clear and makes sense. Cheers for taking the time to detail that.

Considering Bitcoin is banned in China, it is no wonder that she became ill and had to go to a hospital. Maybe she should check out the current policy in her own country before embarking on such an exercise.
Meanwhile, I am going to see if I can survive on a bag of weed for a week in Dubai. Blog to follow....

Don't be fooled people.

Ponzi scheme at best.

At least they are being transparent. Lol

Generally, it is very difficult to predict price levels. I have been in the financial trading business for 30 years now and the amount of times I have heard people quote price levels in the media and get it wrong or retract and change the previous statement, is ridiculous. People get it wrong more times than they get it right. It is comical and boring at the same time. I never listen to these experts because they are usually deluded that they can predict price action. Buy the rumour sell the fact.

No. 100k is not a problem. But you may cross the spread more than you would like in euro.

BTC USD had more participants and more volume. So you can do big size without moving the market too much.
I trade BTC/USD, BTC/EUR and BTC/GBP. Sometimes the spread (the difference between the bid and the ask) in BTC/EUR and BTC/GBP is much wider, sometimes $15 wide.

If really depends on your risk appetite. As you know, bitcoin can be volitile. If you had of done this at the begining of the year, your BTC investment would have lost a lot.
So if you put all your earnings into BTC you are going to have to deal with the fluctuations of the market. You can apply a hedge, so long BTC and short BTC futures. But that maybe a little too sophisticated for you. Also, remember the fees that coinbase apply and any other 3rd party. One of the issues with coinbase is that when most people buy or sell crypto, coinbase just implements a market order which can mean you will get an average of prices. So your conversion rate is not always a good deal. 
If you are considering this just to deal with getting the money from USD to EUR then it may not be worth your while. Probably less risk and cheaper to transfer the funds from your bank in USA to your Bank in Germany.
One last coment is that the BTC in Euros is not as liquid as BTC in USD.

If you have holding a a load of whatever and then coinbase list what your holding and make it available to their huge liquidity pool of customers, then you have an easy way to cash out for fiat. Pretty simple really.

Even worse, imagine that both BitMex and Binance are scams. Then maybe your looking at $1 bitcoin.

Is it me or is that headline just gobbledegook? 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:38:59
I am scared

Only if you can guarantee any losses. Then I can bring horde to the flashmob.
