���� why exactly 20
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:40:14
What house costs 150k there you get at least to 400k
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:25:42
Well when you are young you cannot really live the rest of your live with one Million, buy a house and it is gone even if you find cheap property.

Thanks man��

Okay thats true but what we wanted to say, at least I did is that you cannot really " throw" around with money, you are not rich with one Million. A modest life is probably possible but nothing else. Consider younare traveling too. Per trip lets say week trips, you will need around 3000$ depending where you go if you want a family,... That means if you travel every year you will already need about 200k if you still expect to live 40-50 years. And lets assume you dont travel every year lets assume just every second year then we got 100k 
So 200k +100k plus cost of living( lets say 400k + electric devices,.clothes,..
It is possible but not easy

If we assume bitcoin getting as popular as Credit Cards then 500k is a sure thing since there can only exist 21 Million BTC

And I almost forgot cars��
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:26:38
No that was just something I wanted to add to my original statement
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:17:44
Just tell them the answer to a different question, many consider gold as a save investment but what does gold back up? You cannot use it for anything neither in production becaise it wouldn't produce profit not anywhere else. It is just a shiny heavy piece of crap, bitcoin has at least a revolutionary usage backing it up
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:54:02
No, it is true you cannot retire with 1000000 but if I would tell you out of an 10k investment you would make 1 Million the next 5 years, I think you would agree that this is a good investment. I dont know how much you are invested or when you bought yourself in but this does not even matter. You still can buy Bitcoins today, just calculate the inner value and if you are pessimistic you will get to 500000/BTC if you are very optimistic ( probably too much) you get to 4 Million. The only problem you will have in the future is that you did not buy more. And of course the price can drop tomorrow to 3000 again or even lower, but people this would mean you can buy Bitcoin even cheaper for some time. The inner value would still be 500k
Bitcoin is still small, there are not that much people who really earn Bitcoin( instead Bitcoin Cash,... Or nothing of those)

If bitcoin gets as popular as credit cards thats the only possible amount if not higher, if it doesn't get as popular it wont, but I think IT WILL
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:00:09
The earnings you made with that 10k investment then, can be invested again at least lets say half of it, thats where the real earning starts and where you can risk "everything" if you want to win everything. If you would find another investment as good as Bitcoin you could then earn 100 Millions and that should be enough. Even if you would invest that money with 20 % per year yoybwould earn a fortune if you are still young now��
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:22:55
Ah okay, so what wallet can you recommend, or is cold offline storage like Trezor, or even on Paper for you the best way to go?
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:39:09
Same ��
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:13:05
First of all it would be a 10000% return not 100 000 second have you seen the chart of bitcoin so far the percentage it increased from the beginning or even a few years later to now is far bigger than the one I predict for the future. 
Also if you invest half a Million with 20% you will have in 15 years a fortune. But if we assume it is not 20% but more than that you will even have more double the amount every year and you will have 16 Million after the fifth year 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:06:40
Look what the Dollar Volume is right now, there can be only 21 000 000 BTC , this means then the value of one BTC is... If you dont get what I am saying tell me I will explain further
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:36:47
Where do you live, just curious, USA, what Sate?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:14:38
First of all thanks for the nice discussion, okay one may not find another good investment where he will make ROI of 10000% again, but from my point of view a profit of 17%per year is definitely possible, 10% would be even possible if you buy the Dow Jones long term or the DAX,..  
I personally invest since 8 years, I know this is not considered as long term but I made about 50-100% over those years which is far far higher than an index ROI of course in bad times I wont make that, but in bad times I try to decrease my loss at the same factor. If you believe that you can predict with strategy which market will grow faster than the other or even which company, than you eventually have to get a higher roi than the index

Not really because the fees would kill you, but you can save it and buy later if its not too late by then
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:23:08
Only the brave are able to achive something, either they lose or win everything but without braveness you wont achive anything in this world. If you only invest a little bit you will have enough in a few years( with a little bit I mean 5 to 10k $ and don't tell me you do not have the money if you really think this is revolutionary you should start working and save money for bitcoins even if that means you have to live for some time like a poor person. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:34:23
Let us assume it is only that popular in the USA thats my number but if we assume all of Europe and Soth America too plus even maybe china, well then its gonna go up to heaven

Kraken has the lowest fees but needs some general knowledge about Exchanges, if you have for example experience in the stock market it will feel natural to you, if not it is still pretty easy to trade there in my opinion
