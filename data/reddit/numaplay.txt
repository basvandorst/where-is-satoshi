I tried using them, but they require a social security number. I forgot to mention that in my first post. I don't think any professional company would offer what I want, so I probably need an individual.

Wow this totally doesn't look like a scam, especially the fact that this account only has two posts, and their both advertisements for your site!

Yeah, I put in $5 there as a test. I was going to end up with about $0.20 worth of Bitcoins, so I just asked for a refund, and they actually refunded me. Since they were so nice about the refund I might have to give them another chance, but you probably have to purchase at least like $50 to make it worth the fees.

Yeah, but I mean imagine this. Donate to Red Cross! All Bitcoin donations will include a 3% discount. I agree humble bundle should state that there are no fees for them with Bitcoin, but since it's pay what you want, there is no use for a discount.

I asked for a way to pay with PayPal or Credit Cards with a low fee. So far I've only gotten one of those, and they have very high fees.

Thanks fantastic! Instead of bitching in every single one of your posts, have you ever tried acting like a human? Just a suggestion, as I can see you treat everyone that way.

I still prefer this one. ՠ
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:22:31
I did, three hours later of not finding anything I decided to make my own post.

I tried that, but the fees were too high that it was useless. Is there a subreddit or anything for a bitcoin market? I know there is for some other alt coins.

I'll take some if you still have any left!

They are more of a charity. That would be a very strange thing for a charity to do.

That appears to have worked! I'll let it download the chain over night and let you know if it works! Thanks for the help!
