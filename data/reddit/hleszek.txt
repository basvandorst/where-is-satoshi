I was so surprised a few days ago when I found out there is still 0 bars accepting bitcoin near brussels ...

MAD - Mutual assured devaluation

It is like that for the french exchange Paymium.

Alive or dead?

probably why the BTC price is now currently rising ...
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:03:14
Nope. If you buy $250 of bitcoin every month starting from now at 4000 dollar and bitcoin and bitcoin increase by $300 dollar every month, then you will have 1 bitcoin after 29 month (when bitcoin is $13900) after spending $8500 dollar in total

Your 2 examples are very different.
In the first case (postponing the next halving), the bad miner is breaking existing rules. 
What happens in this case is as soon the bad miner is broadcasting the block without the correct coinbase value (after the normal halving block height),
the blocks produced by this bad miner will be rejected automatically by all the nodes this miner is connected to. The other nodes will never see this block and bitcoin will continue to work same as before (just a little more slowly until the difficulty autocorrect).
You have to remember that the nodes are verifying the longest CORRECT chain. It does not matter that this bad miner has a longest chain with broken protocol rules.
In the second case (raising minimum fees), the bad miner is producing correct blocks but imposing stricter rules.
In this case, this bad miner can accept other blocks only if they also impose the stricter rule (minimum fee raised) but he can also reject all other blocks and produce all the blocks himself. It will work but will surely decrease the value of bitcoin dramatically so this bad miner will earn less money.
tldr: a bad miner can enforce stricter protocol rules but cannot break existing protocol rules.

Correction: armory needs bitcoind --&gt; needs full blockchain

coincidence ?
33333 base 4 = 1023 = 2^10 -1
0255 = 2^8 -1

Saying that you are safe if you use it on an offline computer is misleading.
You first need to be sure that the code is correct. bitaddress.org could be compromised and serve a page which gives predetermined addresses that a hacker can sweep (even if the codes are generated on an offline computer).
What I would do:
* save the page on a usb-key
* Inspect the code if you are a programmer
* Compare the code with the version on github: 
* DON'T use it directly
* calculate md5sum/sha1sum of the web page
* wait one week and check that the md5sum/sha1sum of the page is still the same, check to verify that there is no scandal about bitaddress.org
Then you should be fine.

What was your thought process ?
Did you first create the 144113420433333025514052015 randomly and then tweaked it  to create another password ?
Or did you create a password randomly, then tweaked it and arrived to the 144113420433333025514052015 ?

Let's see how Gavin could have been fooled:
* The laptop has been tampered and then resealed.
* The laptop was new but was interchanged with another one when Gavin looked in another direction (physical magic trick)
* The laptop was new but was hacked from the USB stick
* or through the wifi (the laptop is new so windows is not up to date with the latest upgrades)
* The electrum software downloaded is not genuine (Man in the middle attack through the wifi)
Other ideas ?

Receiving is not enough I think. To be sure that my computer is not compromised I need to spend it after. But address reuse is not a good security practice...
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:27:39
Thank you! Just what I needed.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:27:14
Because if I don't spend it how do I know that what I see on my computer is correct ? Of course I would be able to see that the small amount has been sent to the address using a block explorer or even another computer but it could be an address owned by somebody else. If I spend it, then it needs to be confirmed by the hardware wallet and then I know that I have the correct private key corresponding to the receiving address.

The mempool is currently empty. So it is an incentive for organisation with a lot of unspent outputs to consolidate them now for cheap.
