That's also the telltale sign of a bubble just about to burst.

I'd rather be comfortable while in this life though. Also, some people like leaving a little something behind for their family and/or friends to make their time living easier.

I saw this video a couple of years ago and found it hilarious, but now I know enough about the topic, it becomes pretty easy to decipher what he's saying because you have the context and can fill in the gaps.

Israel has a GDP of $340 billion, and receives annual funding from the US of only $3 billion, most of which is military funding, which comes to help the US as well in terms of technology advancements and regional stability.

I buy iPhones because I used to think they were the best phones, not to look cool, and now I'm just trapped into buying them because Apple are a-holes.

I'm in the same boat as you man. Well, apart from the 50lb testes. Maybe you could supplement your income by staging a freak show?

Massive survivor bias here. Of course there are *some* rich people who are unhappy. But have you actually performed a study of all people, happy and unhappy, rich and poor, to be able to conclusively say that money doesn't bring happiness (to an extent)? Other people have done, and have found that -big surprise- poverty causes despair, while being comfortable provides greater happiness relatively. And that after a certain point of wealth, more wealth doesn't provide noticeably more happiness.

I hate to disappoint you, but you'd need to release semen at nearly 4000 mph for it to be able to orbit the moon. Do you think you have that in you?

Only thing is that IE doesn't prevent you from downloading Chrome. Don't think that banks are gonna go down without a fight if/when their profits start to be hit by people moving their money to crypto.

How great it would be to have the assets of a baby boomer and the knowledge of a millenial.

That's not true at all. There *used* to be something like that, called language immersion, which isn't in the image, but they culled it because of legal issues, or so people believe.
