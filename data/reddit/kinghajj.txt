Bandwidth is the real concern. Already, a month’s worth of blocks takes up 6x24x30=4320 MiB. Many ISPs have caps well below this. Further increases would cause more centralization of nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:53:35
Comcast, one of the largest ISPs in the US, has a 1000 MiB monthly cap, so the existing block size limit already requires users who can afford the “excess usage” penalties. This is not some hypothetical concern, especially with net neutrality under attack. And I didn’t mention lightning at all...?
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:42:33
Ha you’re right, I did the conversion incorrectly. I would actually favor bigger blocks, but done in a coordinated way a la SegWit, not a dangerous instant hard fork that would be chaotic. Has a BIP for such a safe block increase vote been proposed? I’m not terribly versed in the inner workings of LN, but what I have read makes it seem semi-centralized, and better able to scale. Something about how in order to acheive Visa transaction rates, blocks would have to be 8 GiB (which surely you agree is much too high?) I don’t see why we can’t both have an orderly transition to larger blocks and LN simultaneously.

I know, it is so obvious that the Bcash coins are identical to the BTC ones, as the only difference is that a new market disagrees to the transactions of the pre-existing property post-fork. Thus, long-term held Bitcoins “became” long-term held bcash; you just have to apply the cost basis to the sale of one “side” of the market, and set the other as $0.

Alt coins use less hashing power because they're less popular/less valuable, not because of some inherent property within them to use less power. (Well, Peercoin is different, but almost all altcoins are just the same blockchain idea from Bitcoin with minor tweaks to the specific hashing algorithm used and the growth constants.) And why do you assume that it's so impactful? All the estimates I've seen are fairly low. Assuming 1W per Ghash, then [Wolfram Alpha]( says the network uses the energy equivalent to 3500-7000 households.

Yes, that's essentially how brainwallet works. The great part is that the private key is only ever stored in RAM, so after you shut down your computer for a few minutes there will be no recoverable traces of it on any computer. If you're really paranoid, disable the page/swap files to ensure that the RAM is never written to disk. You just have to be confident that you'll never forget the passphrase, or else you'll never be able to recreate the private key when you eventually want to spend!

Alternative currencies are legal in the US as long as they do not attempt to confuse people into believing that they're legal tender. That's why Liberty Dollars got shut down, because they advocated that people pass them off as legal tender.

That's still illegal, gains are still gains regardless if they're realized in dollars, goods, or services. The market value of the good or service is just like the "sale price" when exchanging for dollars, so you'd deduct the cost basis from that and owe taxes on the gains.

@_date: 2011-06-04 10:42:18
1) That's an sloppy estimation of market capitalization, as you yourself later note when you mention that only 10% of bitcoins that exist are actively traded in the exchanges. (I'd like to see a source for that figure, but it sounds right.) Not to mention that there are unknown numbers of missing bitcoins.
2) The price of bitcoins is rising because the volume has been rising greatly in the past few weeks. Probably much of this is speculation, true, but it's also being used to exchange real goods and services.
3) Your doubts about whether anyone would spend bitcoins on real goods and services doesn't pan out. Just look at or the market on the official Bitcoin forum, the virtual credit card exchanges, and the Trade page on the bitcoin.it wiki. People are still spending even though the prices are increasing so quickly now; I don't think they'll have trouble with moderate deflation when the economy stabilizes.
4) No one believes that the value will grow exponentially indefinitely. That's literally impossible. (I know you didn't say "indefinitely", but it seemed to be implied; at least it seemed like you meant "for a long time".)
Edit: 4, not 5.
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:37:31
1) Both (though I use the older definition of "libertarian," not the current American-centric one.)
2) Long haul. When I began I thought it would be great if it reached $2 by now, so I'm pleasantly surprised at the rapid appreciation.
3) ~370 Mhash/s with an overclocked XFX 5870. My total investment into Bitcoin was just the card and a new power supply for it. (I'm lucky enough that I don't pay for electricity myself, so I'll mine even if it becomes uneconomical in the short term to do so.)

1. Cash out 
2. Determine cost basis for amount sold
3. Compute $&lt;cash out value&gt; - $&lt;cost basis&gt; = &lt;capital gains&gt;
4. Compute $&lt;capital gains&gt; * &lt;long term capital gains tax rate&gt; = $&lt;taxed&gt;
5. Set aside $&lt;taxed&gt; into a high-interest savings account 
6. Report these figures to IRS in tax filing, paying taxes from money set aside in the savings account.

We don't even know if these earliest adopters (specifically Satoshi himself) still have the keys to spend these coins; they may just be dead in the water. They've yet to be spent, anyways. I've had a somewhat crazy idea that when Bitcoin reaches some high level of popularity/acceptance, that these bitcoins will be randomly transferred to other addresses in the block chain, to spread allocation around.

It's difficult to say for certain when there's a bubble until *after* it's already popped. A more interesting question, however, isn't when it might pop, but what value it will consolidate toward after a pop?
@_date: 2011-06-04 07:02:46
Gold has value because it's malleable (and therefore rather fungible), pretty, and rare (nowadays, it's also the best conductor, but historically that was completely insignificant). Bitcoins have value because they're extremely fungible, easy to store and transfer (much more so than gold, which takes space and is heavy), and rare. It's an digital commodity. If a community grows around it and uses it as a medium of exchange, it gains value, just as gold gained value thousands of years ago when people decided to start using it.
@_date: 2011-06-08 06:57:12
The fees should definitely decrease as the price increases. I'm surprised the users haven't demanded that yet.
@_date: 2011-06-13 05:50:46
Yeah, because the only reason you found the block is because you were lucky enough to get the work that led to it. If you were solo mining, you'd have to do the rest of the work of all other pool members before you'd have found the solution. So it's fair. Some pools do give bonuses for finding blocks, though, I think.
@_date: 2011-06-13 10:38:56
When new dollars first enter the market, it hasn't had time to adjust to the new influx, so the first party to get the new dollars has an advantage because they get to buy things at current prices before they go up because of inflation.
Bitcoins only get devalued when more is put into the market. Currently only a small percentage of all bitcoins is actively traded on the exchanges; if all became available with the current demand, the price would drop. But as it stands, demand is rising sharply, much faster than the mining rate, so the price also increases. Eventually demand won't continue growing at the same rate (it can't go on forever!), and it's true that anyone who invested late would probably not get any returns, or may even lose some. But how is that different than any other commodity or stock? And how is it stealing if both parties agreed to the transaction?

1. 600,000 / 6,000,000 = 1/10. I don't think that's the number you want, either. The "market cap" listen on bitcoinwatch.com is simply TotalBTC * CurrentPrice. As I said, this is not useful because AvailableBTC &lt;&lt; TotalBTC, actually the two can never be equal anyways because some are lost forever.
2. Increased volume means greater demand, not supply. People are more willing to spend dollars on bitcoins than they were before.
3. I doubt it's $100 million, too, but again, that's not a good number to use.
4. (Sorry about the typo.) The volume in dollars (demand) seems to be increasing [somewhat exponentially]( We just had a near-million dollar day yesterday.

Prices are pegged to the USD not necessarily because the sellers will immediately liquidate into USD, but so that new buyers only have to spend USD at the current market rate to purchase items in bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-06-13 09:59:27
Well, yeah, if you trade one item for another, both must exist! "So when the Fed loads a fresh new batch of dollars to a bank, which sells them off for yen, that yen has to come from someone else's pocket?" Yes, of course it does. But trading isn't the only way to use bitcoins, in fact it's much better to spend them within the economy.

With bitcoincashout.com you can avoid dealing with the banks directly. I'm not sure if you could use this to pay bills with, though. Each virtual card may be freezable, but since bitcoins are not you would just get new cards as needed.
Governments may put pressure on large businesses not to accept the currency, but that still doesn't stop the Bitcoin economy from growing; there aren't any major businesses using it now, either, and of those that do the proportion of revenue derived from Bitcoin is likely very small, yet the demand for bitcoins continues to rise. Most non-exchanging business in Bitcoin are small sales of goods and services between private parties, and for that I think Bitcoin will thrive because of its advantages.

I don't think it's possible to unload all 8000 in one go (or 10000, which is what mtgoxlive.com currently shows.) Instead, as the highest asks start getting eaten away, current ask orders will be removed and replaced with orders at lower prices, and likely orders for more bitcoins than before. The price may drop a lot, as it did over the weekend, but it can't fall to zero in an instant.

I agree with you that the Bitcoin has a much higher-than-average proportion of various kinds of--well, let's put it diplomatically--*eccentric* people. There are serious concerns about MtGox, but don't forget that there is also TradeHill, although their credibility is only slightly higher than MtGox's at this point. Mybitcoin.com and other scams only serve to damage the community, though I suspect incompetence (e.g. the MtGox fiasco) will be a larger problem at this stage.
I'm not sure who the "only legitimate trader" you refer to is, nor why being a "Freemason/SomethingAwful troll" is relevant to Bitcoins. The ponzi scheme you refer to is openly called such, so it's basically a form of gambling. If you're against all forms of gambling, then I can understand your complaint, but otherwise I don't see a moral issue.
If you don't have a problem with stocks, which people can buy only to see lose tremendous value, why have a problem with the $30 bubble? Sure, you can blame speculators and pump-and-dumpers, but that's the community again, and not the fault of the project/currency itself.
Bitcoin attracts an undesirable crowd, but the core innovation, the block-chain/proof-of-work system, is, I believe, revolutionary, as it has numerous potential applications. We've already seen one such example in Namecoin, which may become more urgently necessary if SOPA/Protect-IP pass in the US. The ability to have decentralized, secure, coordinated information storage and manipulation could be massively empowering to the public once these technologies mature. This, to me, is the real importance of Bitcoin, even if it fails in its current form as a currency.

When you buy on MtGox, it credits your account with a certain number of bitcoins which it manages in escrow.

I bought mining equipment back almost exactly two years ago, because I was unsure of how much I'd be willing to invest and thought that I could earn more BTC by mining. When I started mining 4 BTC per day, it seemed like the better choice. Difficulty went up, of course, and my returns went down. I've mined less than 200 BTC total, and have spend 75% of it; whereas, if I had taken the plunge and invested $1000 at $0.8, well... I'd be a lot happier right now. YMMV, of course.

@_date: 2013-11-12 21:21:23
AFAIK you don't pay taxes for holding Bitcoins that increase in value, e.g. just because I have 10 BTC now  I don't owe taxes later just because they rise in value to, say, $1000. Tax liability incurs when you sell BTC for dollars, and possibly when you make purchases using BTC.
Storing large amounts of BTC in any online wallet is probably a bad idea, though.

Bitcoin is *not* currently infinitely divisible. That would require an extension. It's purpose is exactly analogous silver: it's more plentiful and easier for low-capital investors to acquire. It will surely always be much lower than Bitcoin, but I don't see why the cryptocurrencies can't complement each other, since they aren't exactly competitors.
@_date: 2013-03-31 06:55:50
They've said that they'll start shipping enough equipment to cover purchased hash outputs ASAP, while continuing to find and fix the cause of the excess power usage so that later models can achieve better efficiency. And now there's a video of a half-powered little SC hashing at around 16 GH/s.

They're easier to acquire because they're produced more frequently, and the mining process is more favorable to GPU miners than ASICs. And I've never heard it mentioned by any Bitcoin dev that they have plans to increase the divisibility--I've just heard them mention that such a change is possible, though would require a substantial change to the protocol.

I'm not an expert, but I've heard that log charts are more accurate as prices tend to move relatively, not absolutely. A $1 move from $1 to $2 is a lot more than a move from $130 to $131, and log charts reflect that. And I believe the chart in number 3 isn't meant to predict the price nor suggest that this current trend will continue indefinitely, but to compare the current upswing to the previous ones.

Various loggers (keyboard/memory) could intercept the password and/or private key, and thereby steal your BTC.

Do you have a source on your claim that simply creating one's own currency is illegal in many places? In the US, at least, it's only illegal to manufacture coins/bills that look too similar to official US ones, which is why Liberty Dollars got into trouble (and because they actively encouraged people to pass them off as a "new kind of money," basically tricking people into thinking they were an official currency), but other alternative currencies like Ithaca dollars still go on unmolested.

Who would be willing to pay more in BTC (or the current equivalent market value in USD) than they estimate the device would generate on its own? My miner current generates about $40-60 per week equivalent in BTC and only costs me only $6 per week to run (or, rather, it would, if I were paying for my own electricity.) And I'm continuing to buy more BTC with the income from my internship (soon to be full-time!), so I'm not really losing much opportunity even if it would nab me more BTC to sell the miner for cash to use to purchase BTC.

That's quite safe unless you question the integrity of the official Ubuntu binaries; NSA could have strongarmed them or just snuck a backdoor into it, so if you're uber-paranoid, you'd build the entire OS from scratch. Of course, maybe the source itself is compromised, better verify each and every line. But wait, the hardware itself may have some kinds of backdoors, better design and construct your own hardware, or at least find and verify open schematics and have those built... But, seriously, what you've done should be more than sufficient. You're using both Bitcoin-Qt and SSL encryption with two different passwords? Nobody's getting into that, even if Dropbox gets compromised.

Namecoin is based on the original Bitcoin source code, too. True, it had to make significant modifications, but that doesn't matter.

Buy the most powerful, most efficient hardware you can.
If you want to start right away, go for a GPU. ASICs are sort of in a limbo right now; Avalon's first batch is shipping, second on its way, third might not even happen... and who knows with BFL. The GPU will still be good for Litecoin mining when ASICs dominate Bitcoin mining.

In practice I would say that this method is very secure, assuming the password is long and unique (e.g., not a sentence from a book or some derivation of it, but something like "correct horse battery staple", except perhaps with twice or three times as many words). Now, there are ways to thwart that, such as software- or hardware-based keyloggers, but if you're reasonably computer literate and confident that you can avoid the obvious scams, I think you should be just fine. (If you're worried about hardware keyloggers, then your adversaries are much more persistent than the average!)

Well, the product seems to work. That address on Eligius is hashing at the rate the pictures have shown.

@_date: 2013-04-09 00:23:56
Do you really think that they have no intention of delivering a product? Would they go through the hassle of designing an ASIC and making at least one, but no others, only to run off with people's money? Any reasonable scam wouldn't bother with designing the ASIC if they were just going to run.

My 30 GH/s earns about 0.026 BTC/day at the current difficulty. If you believe that Bitcoin will eventually be worth a lot, though, then even that paltry sum will some day be worth a lot. That's how mining usually works best, in my experience. When I started mining 4 BTC/day at $1/BTC, I wasn't too thrilled, but now it's retroactively become a lot more valuable!

Probably not a great idea to have the private key in plain view like that. An entrepreneurial thief could have a camera that scans for QR codes for BTC keys, and swipe the funds if you pull out the bill.
@_date: 2013-02-11 21:29:51
The BFL ASICs should stay profitable for a while, though. The 30 GH/s model draws 30W, which is about a nickle per day at the electricity rates in my area. Even if it gets only 0.05 BTC per day, that's still over a dollar at today's prices. Of course, you need another computer running to plug the ASIC into, but if you already leave your computer running all the time anyways, you might as well literally be making money.

It's exponential because that's how growth works. I tell 5 people, they each tell 5 peolpe, *they* each tell 5 more... etc. At some point it will stop once there are no more people to tell, which will be the crucial moment. If enough of these newcomers stay and the volume stays up, these prices may be sustainable. If hordes of them panic and cash out, however, the price may crash again like it did in 2011. Anyone who claims to know which will happen is likely lying.

I'm with fried_dough, you could really use an editor to polish this up. If you're going to go through all the trouble to make it appear like an academic piece, you might as well adhere to their conventions and hope to be taken more seriously.

The problem is enforcement. That's not how supply and demand work! The only way to achieve such an outcome would be to inflate the money supply with demand, but doing that in a decentralized way is not easy task.

I think at $500 and $1000 we'll see major sell-offs.
@_date: 2013-02-25 01:16:10
Why is $1000 not realistic? I think it will have passed $100, maybe even $200, but probably would have settled somewhere in between.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:17:08
The latter. I read just today that the program that matches orders to the book is single-threaded, which makes sense, since any attempt at multi-threading would require a big ol' lock around the order book anyways. I was thinking it could help if MtGox had multiple order books with their own threads, but I don't know how traders would react to that.

If you are, you're probably better off doing pay-per-share. BTCguild currently pays 0.0000035469858386 BTC per share. Try mining, estimate how long it takes you to generate a share, then calculate how much you might earn. Just for fun, see how much the BTC you would earn in a day would be worth at $1000, $10,000, etc. The only con I can imagine, even with free electricity, is that you'll stress your CPU and possibly wear it out sooner. If you're the kind of person who replaces your desktop regularly anyways, then I'd say go for it. But, really, if you want to earn a decent amount, look into a high-end GPU and/or an ASIC. You could still use a GPU later for Litecoin (and possibly other altcoins) once the Bitcoin difficulty becomes prohibitively high.

1) Send them to an address you control. 2) You may very well lose any Bitcoins stored there. 3) Yes, Electrum is a popular secure client, and there are also "brain" and paper wallets.

By the end of the year, quite possibly. Tomorrow is probably a tad too optimistic, though! Of course, we would have thought the same about a $200 rise within 24 hours, so... really, who knows?

1. Currently yes, but the general idea you've independently arrived at is already being worked on in order to reduce the blockchain size in the future.
2. With the proposal mentioned above, even if BTC becomes quite successful, storage capacity should continue greatly to exceed the needs to the blockchain. Even without implementing this proposal, the network is still sound for quite some time. The most significant short-term risk is that only a few people will bother downloading the entire 12 GiB+ blockchain.
3. It remembers the last block it saw, say  and if a peer says that it has a higher-numbered block, your client asks it for a copy and begins verification.

Satoshi didn't keep Bitcoin a secret while he mined in those early days, though. He had already published the paper and announced the initial software implementation, so anybody could have mined if they had wanted to. That's much different than some alt-coins where the authors mine privately before the announcement.

In order of importance:

False dichotomy. Just because one wants to keep up-to-date on price movements does not mean that they are "trying to make a quick buck" at someone's expense, nor that they aren't interested in "more online services."

$20 would still be up from 3 months ago.

Honestly, the best option would probably be to just plop a few hundred (however much you can safely invest) into BTC or LTC and hold it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:53:04
No, that would require that malware is installed on the computer itself, as private keys are never sent over the network (that would defeat the point of them being private!)

I never said it was evidence, just thought I'd point out that there is at least one other person having a similar issue who provided slightly more information about it.

I recall hearing somewhere once that some of them (not sure if BFL, Avalon, or some other manufacturer) can be reconfigured to perform some variable number of SHA-256 hashes, but I'm not very firm on that. I just didn't want too hastily to generalize. Was it really necessary to "correct" me when I pointed out in my very next sentence that the actual algorithm is double SHA-256? [This site]( shows a couple other coins use SHA-256, like Ixcoin and Freicoin.

I'm still making purchases even with the price rises. "Now" is always preferred to "later." Besides, by stimulating the Bitcoin economy, I encourage the value to rise compared to if I had just hoarded them all.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:09:53
Earlier when I canceled an order during high lag, it eventually did show up as canceled, once the lag had passed. I think that once you click "cancel" it registers somewhere in the MtGox system, eventually, but, because of the lag, you can't tell.

Has anyone actual said "Bitcoin" specifically, or merely only "virtual currencies?"
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:49:13
IIRC, the first burst from $32 to $17 was a major correction to the recent price rise. Shortly after, Mtgox was hacked, which severely damaged confidence, and is presumed to be the cause of the slow tumble to the $2 bottom. I don't see any reason why, even without "drama," there won't be some correction; I'm just not certain that we're near the top yet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:52:12
There's no federal sales tax, so the IRS shouldn't care about purchases made with Bitcoin. Your local and state governments might, though.

1. Backup. If your computer crashes, just copy the backup wallet.dat to the appropriate directory, and run the Bitcoin client again.
2. The Bitcoin-Qt client has supported encrypted wallets for a while now. So if you try to spend coins from the program, you have to enter the correct password first.
3. For more secure storage, there are other options, such as paper or brain wallets.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:46:46

That's not how schedules work in the real world. You can't predict everything, so you have to manage risk. If the previous schedule is impossible, then you have to make another. So they are ahead of schedule, according to the current one, which almost always the most important one.

Hell, back in 2011 I contemplated risking $1000 of my college savings to pick up a chunk of coins at around $0.7-$1, but opted instead to buy a mining GPU.

This seems to go against Avalon's previous claims to be selling ASICs for the benefit of the network. If they want as many ASICs in as many hands as fast as possible, why wouldn't they publish what they've learned? (Because they want to make money by keeping a competitive advantage, of course; I'm just pointing that out.)
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:54:32
Not everything in BitMit is up for auction. There are many small-time vendors, like SteamGames. And then there's the Silk Road, whose sales figures are even more opaque than they used to be.

They perform SHA-256, so anything that requires performing that quickly could benefit. Technically some of them only perform double-SHA-256, which is less useful generally. There are other altcoins that use the same double-SHA-256, though, so current-generation miners can move to those when Bitcoin mining becomes dominated by the next-generation ones.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:53:34
Did you just install it and download the blockchain? Then it's verifying each and every block. It only does that the first time, IIRC.

Why would he sell these at $200 a pop when they cost $1200 and could be earning him more than that in BTC? I'd only try it if you use an intermediary that lets you chargeback if nothing arrives.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:10:21
The first outcome isn't likely, as it would require banning encryption, which both the government and big corporations need. It's too late to try to put the crypto cat back in the bag and horde it all to themselves anymore. Banning Bitcoin would also violate free expression--after all, transactions are just signed messages with a specific format--and that would hopefully be rejected by the courts.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:21:45
I forgot about FPGAs, honestly. They're less energy efficient than ASICs, but that's not much of a concern for you. When I last checked that page, none were really available.
ASICs are in "limbo" because there are only three known manufacturers: Avalon, which has no units to order and is back-logged with current ones; BFL, which still takes orders, but has no reliable timeframe on when they might arrive; and ASICMINER, which is keeping what they make for themselves to mine with, though they *could* decide to sell eventually. The only way to get an ASIC "quickly" would be to buy someone's first or second-batch Avalon, which will be very expensive (many thousands of dollars.)
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:17:08
What's the security difference between an deterministic one seeded by 12 words and a Bitcoin-Qt wallet encrypted with those same 12 words? They seem at least equivalent, and Electrum is theoretically more vulnerable in the case of a weak seed because an attacker wouldn't even need to have an encrypted wallet file to crack, but just an public address to target.
@_date: 2013-02-12 04:11:54
Really? It still took me a few hours to download the whole blockchain. It really started to slow down toward the end; going from 90% to 100% took at least two hours IIRC.
