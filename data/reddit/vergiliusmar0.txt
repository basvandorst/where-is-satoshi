Blöd nur, dass man aus damaligen 60 € bis dato nur ca. 90€ gemacht hätte und keine 76k... Unabhängig davon macht der post auch inhaltlich keinen Sinn - nutzt ein bisschen mehr Hirn, wenn ihr schon scam verbreiten wollt.

When 1 BTC is enough to buy a ticket to the moon via some private space-travel company :p

Redditor for 0 hours, 65k scammed and you write about this after 1 year? ya, sure, go on.. btw 65 btc wasn't even worth 65k back then, rather like 30k...

DO not go gentle into that good night*   best film ever!

 still has the 1050$ low peak listed in their BTC/USD ticker.

No popcorn here ;_;

Hast du schon GEZahlt? ;p
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:50:23
1360 actually (on Coinbase).
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:40:20
1050 for about 2 seconds

If you have to ask - don't.

Current status in the BTC civil war?
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:09:50
How long does it take for the BTC to be "booked again" in the sending wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:42:08
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:39:03
Been too busy follow news lately - in what way did BU "lose the battle"? Thx in advance.

Why can I send BTC from my Coinbase wallet to my mobile wallet w/o fees but when sending BTC from my mobile wallet to CB I have to pay fees?
@_date: 2017-01-06 09:59:48
So I decided to buy my 1st Bitcoin today and have a question. I'm not really intending to sell (in the near future) but if I do, is there a possibility to send the cash to my local bank account? I live in Germany and purchased BTC via coinbase.
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:27:43
I'm pretty new to BTC and have no clue what SegWit is, would like to learn about it, though. Could anyone provide a link or give a simple explanation? Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:00:35
Probably a stupid question - do you always need a internet connection to be able to buy something via BTC since the information/transaction has to somehow reach the blockchain or do technologies like NFC or bluetooth also work and if so, how?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:36:19
Any risk attached to this?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:24:03
Wrong. The seed works with all supporting wallets (coinomi eg). 
@_date: 2017-01-26 07:55:34
What happens if difficutly for mining new Bitcoins gets too hard or when the last Bitcoin is mined? Will miners keep finding new blocks for the fees or will the blockchain be "full"?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:34:00
Wait, you can lend BTC on Polo for 2.7%/d?! Is this also possible on other exchanges and with other currencies?
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:06:45
Ya, do that, if you want to pay the highest fee possible..
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:12:59
I wouldn't do that, prices are ridiculous and availability is limited (like 1 trader in a radius of 50 km...).
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:14:53
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:10:56
I'm speechless... This is so wrong... It really is time for a financial revolution...
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:51:07
Enlighten us.

1mBTC = 0.001 BTC
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:28:29
wtf, seriously?! Source?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:50:56
I'm also curious. Any math wizard wanna calculate the exact odds for this?
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:15:34
Same here. Already reported.
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:22:42
He's not mining BTC directly, tho. He's using Nicehash which chooses the most profitable algorithm/coin and pays out in BTC.
 try OC'ing and monitor results.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:46:16
Erm, ya, ofc. I learned them during the basic research I did lol
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:31:39
So you just threw money at something some internet stranger told you it would make you rich? You didn't even do a basic research before 'investing' in something? Sorry, but at that point no one can help you and it doesn't matter if you are new. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but it's the truth and someone has to tell you this.
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:34:28
So what stands red and yellow for?
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:02:54
If you don't know what this means, you should stop mining. Seriously..
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:45:21
It's called Bcash.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:05:57
ffs.. Ver is just full of shit..
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:28:42
Gosh, maybe the price but not even close the marked cap.. you know, price means nothing. Current marked cap of gold is 7,596,474,007,987 $ - you do the math ;)
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:36:55
Eh.. not really...
