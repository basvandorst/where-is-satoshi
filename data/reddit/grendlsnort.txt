Wall St watched Mark Karpeles &amp; Mt. Gox with keen attention and figured...''we can do better than that.''

Me too..watching a Bitcoin sponsored fighter get taken to the mat and tapped out will do all kinds of good for brand recognition. On second thoughts..better sponsor a Champion..better yet an undefeated up and comer.

I wish I had the money to buy all of the Bitcoin I want..as it stands..I will be getting them now at any price...all the way to single digits. Time will be our friend. Bitcoin will make you not just rich..but wealthy time is all its going to take. I am buying fractions of bitcoin when I can't afford the whole amount...because I know a fraction of a coin will be enough when the market turns. Visionary's see the future..the.courageous shape the future and wise wait for the turning of the tide.
Vindication will come for you and all of us...WE ARE BITCOIN and we are the future.

This might just be a candidate for post of the century..so true so right if you blink you might miss it.

363 + 2 = 365 as in days in  1 year..we don't buy for day to day moves...we buy for a generational shift...because SHIFT HAPPENS...you are a part of it...welcome aboard.

Buyer's remorse...when you get in is never as important as when you get out...What happens in between is not really up to you...Your two key points of decision...are the day you buy and the day you sell. Winkelvoss Twins are taking a pounding...AGAIN

Yes belief is everything,the collapse of belief precedes capitulation.
