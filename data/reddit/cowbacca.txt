You're missing that Coinbase accepts US banks only.  Being British, I don't have a US bank account. :(  Every where else I've looked requires verification, apart from BTC-e.  I don't have a Visa or Mastercard credit card (only a Visa debit card), so that doesn't work either.

If they've managed to get a keylogger on to your computer I'm guessing they can probably access your clipboard as well.  I may be wrong but it's not something I'd bet my passwords on.

Apparently there are problems with setting up a bank account to use for a bitcoin exchange in the UK.  There are European ones but they all seem to require full ID and proof of address verification.

This is something I'm not clear on.  Is one legally not allowed to take payment for goods in the form of something that isn't officially a currency?  If so, does this mean trading things is illegal?  Bartering is illegal?
I'm not trying to make any point here, just curious.

Euros aren't a crypto currency.  You can deposit and withdraw Euros.  You have to change your money to Euros first (your bank probably does this for you) but that's what everyone outside the US has to do to use all the USD sites anyway.

Kraken or Bitstamp.  Kraken has been better for me.

Try Kraken.  I'm a Brit and the most common exchanges are very much geared towards Americans so I had to search around a bit.  Found Kraken.  You need to provide your address to get verified up to $2000/day, $10,000/month.  If you want to depositing more money than that, you'll need to provide proof of residency and all that jazz that most other websites ask for to even trade at all.  Managed to buy some Bitcoin the other night, felt good after trying for about a week and a half.  I just wish I'd found it sooner rather than messing about with other exchanges while the price more than doubled.

I've been trying to buy Bitcoin for about a week but have to go through long verification processes, then wait for my money to actually get there, THEN I can buy some.  I have no experience of actually using it yet, but my current experience is that it's damn hard to get hold of.

Well, my verification was just denied.  All my bills are redirected so each line of the address has a single thin line through.  Though the address is clearly visible, this isn't good enough for the purpose of verification.  Not much I can really do about that.  I'll see if I can find something else to use as proof as address.
The other guy is talking about this being part of the traditional currency process but it's not always the case - I can easily buy $10,000 USD (and many many other currencies) with my GBP without providing any proof of my address.  I would hope to be able to do the same with Bitcoin, though I appreciate that this has nothing to do with Bitcoin as a currency in itself.

Retailers using services like Bitpay can choose receive bitcoin payments in USD straight away, instead of actually ever touching the bitcoin themselves.

I had a lot of the same problems, until I found Kraken. They verify you for up to $2000/day, $10,000/month by only providing your address.  It took less than a day for mine, been using it for about a month now and it's all working fine.  The SEPA transfer from my UK bank account takes 1 day if I do before a certain time.

Yeah, I'm not saying don't use it.  I'm just saying I wouldn't consider my passwords secure solely because I'd copy pasted them instead of manually typing them out.  As always with security, if somebody really wants to get in, they will.  You just have to make it not worth their time/money/effort to do so.

This brings up a good question.  Where is the buyer protection in Bitcoin?  From what I understand, there isn't any, you just have to trust the merchant.  Given that the website was linked from a trusted source, people would be more likely to believe it was legitimate.  I can only hope the people behind Bitcoin Black Friday were given some proof that we weren't, and it's not in fact a scam.

Yep!  I've put Euros in and taken BTC out, but not the other way around.  Can't see why it wouldn't work though.

It's more than double just in the time I've been trying to actually buy some.  This is one of the rare occasions in life where being British is worse than being American.

I've just had a look again and they actually have USD options now.
