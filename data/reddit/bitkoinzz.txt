@_date: 2014-04-23 17:30:10
Paypal will not gauarantee this transaction and they will not check the Blockchain. They don't even know how. If this guy charges back the transaction with Paypal or at his bank  or he claims he did not get the Bitcoins then Paypal will try take the money back from you. But if you take the cash and run and close the bank account and claim fraud then they can't get the  money back from you.

ok heres how you do it. Withdraw the money out of Paypal ASAP. Then when you have the cash CLOSE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY. Tell the bank that you account number was compromised on the internet. Then if that guy reverses charges and then Paypal tries to debit your bank account your bank should stop it. Just keep claiming that it was not authorized transaction.
P.S. He will not be able to stop the Paypal payment to you. It will go through initially. Grab that money and run.
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:13:00
no prob. you could just send it back to that same wallet
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:49:54
well the electrcity costs on that chart are way too high. I pay $.10 a kw/h. Each S1 costs me about $15-17 a month.
YOu can get an S1 for about $575 on Amazon or eBay or from me or you can buy one from Bitmain for .938 BTC right now but you would have to buy theBitcoins form an exchange and you will pay higher than market price. Still a good deal. Yes, you can make money with Bitmain Antmine S1's. You will make you money back in about a month. I know. I am running 6, was running 9.

You need 2-3 Bitmain S1 mining rigs. Each S1 will do 200gh or about .022btc a day right now. They are the cheapest gear anywhere right now. You can get them on Amazon.com or eBay or I can sell you a couple. Or you can buy them directly from Bitmain in China but they only accept Bitcoins. I have sold about 8 of them in the last couple weeks. I have 7 running now.Electricity is only about $15 a month.You will need a decent power supply, about $60 anywhere.

@_date: 2014-04-16 00:38:42
I think it has something to do with the amount of fee that you aadded maybe? more fee/ faster confirmation? is that correct?

That is a good plan. I buy, sell, mine, sell mining gear, etc daily. But having a bunch of Bitcons stashed, that is a very good idea brother.

take the money out the bank TODAY, then tell the bank that your account number was leaked on the internet somehow. They will close it and immediately open a new one for you.
Then later if Paypal charges it back tell the bank it was fraud. You see, even if you close the accoutn Paypal can try to force it back through your bank anyway.
Also Paypal cannot just take the money back out. They would send you a notice that the buyer was trying to do something to get the money back first.
P.S. If Paypal tries this and cannot get the money from you they will close yourt Paypal account. Just open another one with diff address and diff card number and diff phone.Remember to delete all cookies and change your IP first.
