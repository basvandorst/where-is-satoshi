8-12 years. The cycle wont get up there for a while but it will!

Think diamonds or popcorn. Just because there isn't quite a limited supply doesn't mean people wont pay extraordinary prices for it. Gold has been mined, and hoarded above ground as money for centuries. Silver on the other hand has been used in so many applications that the above ground supply is actually lower than gold! Price of silver is $15 an ounce, with a presumably extremely limited supply. Figure that one out. We will also likely run out of these resources here on earth in our lifetimes unless we get up to those asteroids.

\&gt; Yes , you are agreeing with me that Indians and Chinese have a predilection for PM's ... the market determines its true value thus the price is exactly what it is worth. In the west this is changing though, much less demand for PM's , even older men like me sold all our gold once we realized that it is obsolete and doesn't have a bright future.
I would say it's more than a predilection. It's understanding the basis of the fiat monetary system is broken and things are about to get a lot worse with more quantitative easing and for thousands of years silver and gold have been the basis of real money. There isn't a loss of demand, the US Mint is currently sold out of silver eagles for the 2-3 time this year alone.
\&gt;Gold is no longer needed as a hedge as we have Bitcoin
I disagree. Items of value will always be needed for financial manipulation and profit. Tulips are still 'needed' and can be profited from. Bitcoin will be an added class of investment until it is used as money everywhere.
\&gt; Gold is a horrible investment with horrible returns
Not really, you need to look at M1+M2 money supply and inflation in comparison to the stock market. Holding gold has outperformed the DOW and other indexes nearly for all of their existence. There are times when it was beneficial to hold cash and there are cycles of this.
In a mad max scenario, I have no interest in gold but prefer bullets, food, medicine and a long list before any &gt;PM's
I've heard that point and have to say that in the mad max scenario, who is going to want to do trade with the guy pointing a gun at you? I doubt we'll ever get to a 'gunz a' blazin' type scenario, so I'm planning to store my wealth and facilitate my own little economy for resources.
\&gt; You need to read this book to find out why using 2 PM's as reserve assets did not work out and why silver had to be dumped--
I'm not talking about using silver as the reserve money. I'm saying it will be a gold and bitcoin future without cash. Silver will benefit from gold's renewed status and has already been used in at least one silver-backed crypto, which I am in support of. JP Morgan is making a profit from shorting silver from the position taken over from Bear-Sterns and since 2011 has been hammering the price down using the paper markets. They are also acquiring hundreds of millions of ounces of physical silver while doing this, I did mention private banks recently went long on silver right? This is why. They have loaded the boat and are waiting for the market to dive as it will.
\&gt; Governments and banks can and do play speculation attacks on each other and if one is using a much less rare PM as a reserve asset they will lose such a speculation attack and destroy their economy
China, Russia, India, Romania are all stacking gold like there's no tomorrow. Central and private banks across the world know that the USD is teetering on the edge of a debt cliff with no ropes or gear. Russia sold all of their US treasury bonds and took up a bunch of Yuan notes. They are doing it to prop up their own currency for the next recession/everything debt bubble. It's coming and I think it would be unwise to throw all your eggs into one basket.

That whole post is a terrifying read from the IMF. You'd be screwed holding cash or 'e-money'. I think the only way out is crypto and precious metals. Anything that can hold value for a long period of time really. Art, patents, fine spirits, etc.
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:54:24


Honestly, with the soulless portrayal of wealth from reality tv shows you'd think more of us would love precious metals. I do and understand their value and importance. 


Then silver should be worth 17.5x less than gold, at a price of at least $72. It's severely undervalued due to the market manipulation (long story)


I slightly agree, I think they'll hodl both.

The important questions.
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:45:42


Millennials and Generation Z individuals grew up in a digital era , and dislike precisely what gold bugs love - specie or physical things over digital.
India as a people have been stacking silver and gold bullion as investments very heavily lately. There was the last guy who finally took the bar! Ignorance of value doesn't mean it isn't valuable. 


Manipulation by JP Morgan Chase. guaranteed to be in the pockets of bigger interests. They have been shorting silver since 2011 and stacking at the same time, private banks went long on silver contracts very briefly for the first time in nearly 30 years recently. 


yea, I just think we'll add BTC and crypto to the list of valuable things governments and old people hoard.

How much power do Visa/Mastercard/Discover &amp; cash systems use? Cause I bet there's a trade off.

Just checked the price a minute ago and headed straight here, nice!

I'm bullish on BTC but I don't think we're out of the woods yet, I feel a significant drop coming and sideways trading before spiking happens. Just conjecture though, I'm not spreading FUD for lower prices either.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:20:37
Careful, don't get rekt.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:23:02
In some ways I think you're right. As in, within that 100 years the USD will fail and pricing BTC in USD terms will be meaningless.
