The history of the situation is that Tesla used to make 2 battery sizes, a smaller one and a larger one, meant for a cheaper and more expensive version of the car. They stopped making the smaller one, as it was more profitable to only make the larger one, install it in all the Tesla's, but manually limiting the available battery size on the cheaper model. This gave the added option of allowing people to upgrade from the cheaper model to the more expensive one.
Intel does similar things with CPU's. All sextocores are actually octocores with 2 cores that did not meet testing standards and have been disabled. "True" sextocores do not exist. Many sextocores can be "upgraded" to octocores by removing the limitation somewhere deep in whatever software governs how the CPU runs. This is generally considered a bad idea, as often the 2 cores were disabled for a reason, i.e. not meeting standards.

As someone who knows very little about the history of all of this, what makes you believe this exactly?

That's not it. You could get the car with a discount with a software limited battery life, and then pay the remainder to get the limit removed at a later point.

As a random guy who started reading into all of this about a week ago: it's really starting to feel like both sides are reading way too much into every little fluctuation. If all these huge shifts are orchestrated by certain groups with certain interest, why are you investing your money in a game where others have so much more influence about the outcome?
By the game I mean the cryptocurrency market as a whole.
