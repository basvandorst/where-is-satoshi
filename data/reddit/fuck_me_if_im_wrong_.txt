Maybe if you bought it at under $100. Otherwise you were already like this when you bought in.

How many Satoshi equals 1 bitcoin?

So I just bought a pretty small amount into HashFlare’s SHA, what are the more profitable pools to set my 3 pools to?
I’m just buying a little bit and seeing how it is at first before I go full bore.

It won’t cost me a thing, everything is nice and cheap for me again.

Do you have any reputable cloud mining sources I could look into and weigh my options? The way I look at cloud mining, I make more money by constantly getting more bitcoin, but with buying and sitting on bitcoin I gain money based purely on how much I own from my purchases. I don’t know the current rates of bitcoin acquired from cloud mining, but assuming if that rate stays the same for the following years, I could eventually have 1 whole bitcoin and who knows, that could be when 1 bitcoin is worth $100,000 (just a guess). But as bitcoin goes up in value, I can also afford less and less of 1 bit coin. The most I’ve been able to buy of a coin was when I bought $100 worth of one when it was around $9k. Now if I were to take $100 and buy into bitcoin, it would be even less than it was at $9k.
Is my thinking wrong here? I also greatly appreciate your reply, very educated and well worded. It should be stickied somewhere to be honest.

Lmao yeah I told him that it’s like 88 satoshi to equal 1 penny, but he said “money is money” so I guess he’s enjoying himself

Actually I’m thinking about listening to [4chan and selling out my bitcoin and moving to chainlink](

So around 6500 satoshi is $1?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:50
Ah ok, my friend currently plays like 4-5 games on his phone that give him like 5 satoshi for playing it each time, are those legit? I know a satoshi is 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin but money is money. I’m not expecting anything that could give me like a whole bitcoin, just something I could earn a little extra change on the side.

No, panic buy!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:00:09
How much does it equal now?
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:10:07
So I’m curious, I just got into bitcoin in the last few weeks, as long as I report any wins I have and pay the taxes, I’m fine?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:19:38
Lol fuck that. IRS would just get hacked and all of the shit would get stolen
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:41:47
I guess I was inquiring on whether or not there are other forms of mining or any other thing I can do to get bitcoin outside of buying it or having my employer play me with it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:25:37
I hope you’re right, is love to buy in at that
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:13:21
