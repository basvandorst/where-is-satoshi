the price fluctuations seem to be caused by market manipulation. the slow transactions are because a large portion of the miners switched over to mining bitcoin cash, leaving a huge backlog of transactions waiting for processing. Who knows what will happen as some of these transactions start to clear. I personally am still waiting for a transaction from 48 hours ago to go through.

The way nicehash works is you get paid for the hashing power you provide. Your hash power is sold on a marketplace, where people bid on it with bitcoin. So you're paid out in bitcoin, but you're not providing any hash power to the bitcoin network. The person in the original comment was asking how he could help speed up transactions by mining, which nicehash will not do.

transactions are taking a very long time to go through as there is a huge backlog of transactions still waiting to be processed.

Isn't it insane that most of the gains for bcash are coming from one exchange?

What are you talking about? Mining with nicehash does not help the bitcoin network at all since you don't mine bitcoin with nicehash unless you have an asic.

Depends on the cpu really. Probably not though since CPUs don't really bring in that much.

Yup, I remember mining in the early days on my gaming pc. Did it for a week and didn't like how loud my computer got. I still cry myself to sleep when I think about it.
