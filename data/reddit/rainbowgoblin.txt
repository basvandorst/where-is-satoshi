Well I must say this looks interesting, where do I sign up *sarcasm* WTF are they thinking here?
I love that line "the national currency is backed by the full faith and credit of the government" - Really? Full Faith...?

Was this following some kind of complaint or discrepancy from the p2p buyer/seller etc?
I have my Revolut linked to my coinbase and do bank withdrawals to it, not had problems (yet)...

I am not holding too much hope of getting funds back, the legal and insolvency "parties" tend to soak up most of whatever is left through fees and such before any debtors (us that lost) get anything IF anything is even recovered. The fact they are asking people to do a survey kind of tells they didn't recover any/many logs from the servers, which will mean even if they have anything there they might not be able to do much about it since they wouldn't know what is what and who is owed.
I lost a lot in Mintpal myself, can't hurt to hope.
Maybe you could post the link to the article I published this morning on BitcoinTalk, I try to avoid that place...

Yes, I received it. You might find this useful.
In short - Its legit. I called Avon and Somerset police this morning after I got the email and asked if it was legit, the lady I spoke to was not sure, asked me to send the email to them and they would look into it.
Got an email back quite quickly confirming it was real and was asked to help with letting people know, so used my contacts to put out the "news" as soon as poss, I THINK I was first, but CCN also published something that showed up in my Twitter feed but I cannot actually find that on their site...

Makes perfect sense my friend, I certainly know what you mean and I do agree with most of your points, I just think that "we" Bitcoin users, need to maybe try to explain things in a different way to the layman.
Do me a favour, PM me your email address and I'll send you a copy of my book, I'd be interested to get your feedback on the way I've tried to explain everything [to the layman].

I disagree somewhat that people need to change to understand Bitcoin. Obviously Bitcoin itself isn't going to change, but perhaps the way in which we explain / educate people about Bitcoin needs to.
IMHO; People (general public) do not necessarily need to know all the "back-end" stuff, such as the technical babel about cryptography and block-chain etc, at least not when they are first introduced to Bitcoin.
The essentials, as I see it, is that people need to simply understand Bitcoin is a form of money that they can use to pay for goods or services.
The problem with trying to explain things to a layman about Central Banks and/or how our Governments REALLY "create" our money, is that more often than not you come across as a "conspiracy-theorist" (Nut) which I know isn't the case, but trying to explain that to a layman who really doesn't understand fiat, not so easy to do.

I disagree somewhat with alexgorale here. If we expect "people" to change to adapt to Bitcoin its not going to happen any time soon.
ShepardSays, I had a similar issue with trying to explain Bitcoin to people and a lot of people I talk to on a regular basis in the "Crypto-sphere" also had similar issues, so, I wrote a book and encourage anyone who wants to learn about Bitcoin, or perhaps similar to your situation where you want to explain Bitcoin to others but find it hard yourself to pique 'their' interests, should read it. I don't know what the rules are here for "Advertising" so I won't give you a direct link, but you can find it at Amazon by searching "Bitcoin, Digital Money Explained" or click my UN and find one of my recent posts specifically about my book where I have advertised it a bit through r/eBooks etc.

I assume you've tried all the normal ways of getting hold of the people in charge of the web-wallet?
Have you had any response from them at all?
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:40:43
Worth knowing, might take a look myself too.
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:18:19
I'll grab it now and give you some feedback.
I also wrote an eBook about Bitcoin but no one has given me any feedback yet (here or Amazon)... wishing you some success :D
