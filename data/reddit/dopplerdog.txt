The Euro is not crashing.  Greece is due to make some loan repayments, and it doesn't have the funds.  Its options are to either tighten spending (leading to recession) or to default (leading to being barred from foreign credit).  To stop money leaving its banking system, access to bank accounts is being restricted, so people can't withdraw money.  The Euro is fine - other than suffering from one of its member countries being in trouble.  It can't crash locally, for the reasons you yourself said.

It's still not stealing, nor a crime.  No-one forced anyone to lend to Argentina, lenders loaned money knowing there was a risk involved.  This is why bonds have ratings.  
edit: and you don't need to lose your job or get sick to plead bankrupcy - being financially illiterate or irresponsible will not land you in jail, otherwise half the population would be in prison.

Defaulting != stealing, one is a crime, the other isn't.  Defaulting on your mortgage may make you bankrupt, but it won't land you in jail.  Robbing a bank will.

I know that there hasn't always been an income tax, but that wasn't really the issue.  If income tax isn't collected, then the shortfall would have to be made through some other tax.  The issue was whether governments have a right to tax or not, not whether some other tax is better than the income tax.  In any case, the tax in question was one *on credit card purchases*.

But if taxation is voluntary, then no-one in their right mind will pay it.  How could government function without funds?

"Why would I pay for sex when I can get the same sex for free?" is a better analogy.

It's not possible to ignore the constitution because the state has means to guarantee it (the police, the judicial system, etc).  Without these publically-controlled means, what's to prevent the well-off from ignoring it?

Hang on... are you saying that a democratically elected government does not have a right to raise taxes?

With fully privatized arbitration and fully privatized security, how would people without means protect themselves from the wealthy?

A contract?  You mean like when a group of people agree on a set of rules (a constitution), and agreeing to pay fees (taxes) to an administrative body (government) of their own free will?


You mean like opting out of your community (country) and moving somewhere else (becoming a citizen of a different country)?


The beauty of it is you don't have to.  You can sell it, and buy one somewhere else.  If that's your objection, then if you really don't like the taxes in your country you can move somewhere else.  It sounds then like there's no problem.
