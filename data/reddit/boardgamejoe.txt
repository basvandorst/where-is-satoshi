Why so you can say something snarky whether I am younger than you or older?
I’m sure you have something prepared for either scenario so why don’t you just type out both responses?

Lool.

Nah I was trying to make 100 into 200. 
Then use the money for Magic cards. 
For a laugh.

Also, I don’t consider poker gambling. It’s skill, not chance. There is a minimal element of luck of course. But if you play like you have some sense, it’s a non issue.

Well shit, I’m too poor to invest then. I’ll guess I will just work at the hospital.

I haven’t put anything in. I was thinking it would be interesting to have a tiny stake in just for fun. 
But I would rather play Texas hold ‘em. I can get to $200 way faster that way :)

You just spelled your “ur”.

I don’t have to rethink anything you pompous little shit. I practically knew the answer when I asked the question, I was just hoping that maybe somehow it didn’t work the way I figured it would. I just wanted to do something fun, but that’s too much money to risk for a gag. Like I said, I would rather play cards.

If that gets you through life, it’s good enough for me too buddy.

I wanted to have a conversation. With the worst sort of people. For some reason. I can’t explain why. But thank you, bad person, thank you for the conversation. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:02:34
Wow, I didn’t know you guys were such elitist douchebags. 
I mean I should have known. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:25:31
I just wanted to chat with you people. Google isn’t fun to talk to. You guys are hilarious.
I haven’t even seriously considered investing a penny into this. 
I would be lying if I said I didn’t wish I had when they were worth pennies. It was like 800 bucks when I first heard of it and that price would mean my kid wouldn’t have had Christmas that year to say the least.
