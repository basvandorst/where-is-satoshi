Regular money, I'm not here to pump cryptocurrency, and you'll find that Internet access has uses outside of it.

More people in India have access to a cellphone than a toilet. I think you underestimate how important and ubiquitous the internet is becoming for even the poorest.

I cam here from Buttcoin, I think that's a ridiculous idea, they will be using cash for small transactions for a long time, which will mean fiat.
But banking and transferring money by test message is already a huge thing in Somalia and a few other shitty countries without the banking infrastructure I'm used. There is a lot of unmet demand for the ability to transfer cash electronically, and I wouldn't bet my life against cryptocurrency capturing some fraction of the remittance market anyway.

Awesome, thanks. If I'm reading it right they're picking it to stay about where it is
I don't think their website is as informative as the one I'm using if anyone else is interested in having a look, but good to have another data point.

I'll keep an eye on that.
To be clear though, I'm talking about any market that *predicts the future price of bitcoin*, not a market that accepts/uses bitcoin.
I couldn't see any exchange rate contracts on Fairlay.

That would be interesting. Still preferable to the physical and legal risks of buying offline for many people though.

Bits of this are pitched above my level, but thank you, I feel more justified in my doubts.
As an aside, I think the proponents would acknowledge that "forever unspendable" is what disputes result in, and hope game theory stops this from happening too often.

Sorry, I misunderstood multi-sig.
I still don't get how the three private keys are created and distributed without there being someone in the middle that could steal the cash, but assuming that's possible then this should work.
-Was my source.
Although, come to think of it, my point actually still stands even if that problem is solved: The first time buyer (or a vendor with more commitment, credentials could be built up by being a man-in-the-middle on trades*) could be a sockpuppet of the "trusted" third party, making thefts like this still possible (although admittedly more difficult, and established buyers are safer)
*acting as a seller to a real buyer and then pretending to be a buyer and giving his address and order to a real seller, reasonably small transaction costs to build a legitimate looking history. I haven't thought this through in detail though.
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:34:02
Yeah, but how is an account created that needs 2 out of 3 signatures without somebody in the middle sending the three sigs out and so knowing what they are.
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:14:05
What dealer would trust a first time buyer?
@_date: 2015-03-18 06:04:45
Ahh, misread the second 2. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 05:04:53
So then what stops me using my key and the shared key, and taking my funds out of escrow and using them myself after the seller has already shipped to me?

Most people use TOR that way.




@_date: 2013-08-05 01:17:08
OK. By closing TBB and reopening it between deep web and normal internet use does it clean itself of things like this?
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:42:40


OP is retarded. This is not a crime. It is a crime to drive drunk *on public roads,* just like it is legal to fire a gun into the ocean, but not randomly around a city.

Are you sure? I thought this was a JS exploit from an onion site? And most people using Tor have JS enabled.
@_date: 2013-08-04 22:21:44
Doesn't this affect anyone who visited those sites with JS enabled? (as it is for most TOR users)
@_date: 2013-08-04 23:57:45


this excludes a lot of people using TBB who think they're secure.
@_date: 2013-08-04 22:20:48
Yeah, but most of that is speculators/ investors. The actual meat behind that froth is ~ 50% SR.
