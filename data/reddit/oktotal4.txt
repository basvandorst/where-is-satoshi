yah this is noot a good idea im from a third world country and if i saw you wearing this watch i might just pay some thugs to steal your watch i can pay people lil to nothing to do anything i want and well this just isnt smart i would not do it im just saying there are people that would in a blink of a second so to me this is stupid about as stupid as wearing a ashirt saying ask me about bitcoin this is reckless and would be looked at as a weak point into your world i would not suggest this to anyone unless they have a security guard with them at all times and they just stunt that hard but a reg dude can get robbed real quick and killed for his btc watch soooo all in all no not a good idea not where im from and i also live in california part time this is all bad smdh

 ppl get paranoid about leaving crypto on exchanges, but as long as you use 2 step authentication you'll be fine    lol you must be new here ever herd of mt.gox?   
yah exchanges are shady take it from me if you dont own the keys and only you own the keys not any of that mobil wallet bs then you dont own your btc got it its that easy so let me ask ?&gt;  do you and only you own your keys? if the answer is no then your still a no coiner

most people who hold btc dont want tsa to know they hold btc thats just a convo im not ready to have when i fly i blank out my ledger and always have my key memorized idk  talk about btc in airports nor would i ever want to wear a watch stating i have btc right now this watch is just another watch but if tsa figures out this is a hardware wallet well thats just a can of worms im not interested about
@_date: 2019-07-04 05:49:09
also your just going around telling everyone your finacial situation by wearing this watch your basicly saying yah im a investor in btc i have money its a like a big flag saying i hold btc on my wrist and im screaming it to the world .... :/
