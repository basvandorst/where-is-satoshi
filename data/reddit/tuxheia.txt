It works perfectly!
It doesn't work the first day or two after you have gotten it done due to swelling and the covering, but after that they work amazingly.
It hurt a little, but not too much at all actually. The pain the day and afterwards was only a little sting.
I've now had it for 4 days and the entry wound is healed, and where the NFC chip is, is only very lightly puffy. 
I paid $190.
I go to one of the best studios in Australia, as they are the only one I trust :)
It was super quick and easy, about 10 - 15 minutes to do, and healing is easy. I really recommend it if you want to have a bit of fun.
So far I've put my PayPal on there, links to my business page and things like that.
I'm waiting for the encrypted apps for PayPass to come out, like VivoKey and Siid.

Yeah, public was what I was thinking :)
Would you happen to have any tutorial on how to do it?
Thank you

I've actually asked that. The casing is glass, which helps a lot. There's nothing in it that will interfere with an MRI.
I've spoken to about 6 people who have gone into an MRI with the same I have, and none have experienced an uncomfortable sensation, and they all function afterwards

Certainly no plans.

Hahaha. I guess it's convenient I'm in Australia :D
But yeah, I did kind of worry about that. I kept some documentation about it being an NFC chip, as well as an X-Ray from my doctor saying it's an NFC chip. Hopefully it's never a problem when I fly overseas.

I feel like I doubt that one. Sure there are some nutty ones out there, but I haven't heard of any hand thieves in Australia recently :p
I just like the option in case I forget my purse. I've done it plenty of times. Same as I'd love to put my loyalty cards on there as well.

It's implanted deeply enough that it's hidden, but still shallow enough to easily tap your phone onto it.
[Here]( is a picture of my hand after 3 days.
The only thing noticeable is the small spot of the entry wound :)
