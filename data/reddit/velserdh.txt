In my opinion it was more criticism on Facebook doing this. Than critique on the actual project itself or the concept of 'cryptocurrency' in general

It triggered me reading into different coins. And it’s fun to see different coins moving your portfolio value. ;)

How do you mean “present”?

I'm from Holland, so out here Litebit is an easier way to start. I started with a Gatehub wallet, that didn't work as well as I expected. So after a while I moved it all to Binance. 
So basicly I made the same moves your making now. Small tip: don't wait with going to Binance, that's when the fun starts ;)
