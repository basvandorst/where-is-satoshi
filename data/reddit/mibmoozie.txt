There's no way to actually know this. Bitcoin's price has historically had little correlation with "news" so this assumption is probably a bit off.

I also mean the effective tax on holdings that occurs from the massive inflation(10% a year) that bitcoin is currently experiencing to pay the miners via block rewards. And of course when that goes away in coming years those tiny little transaction fees will have to explode in cost to cover what those block rewards once did.

This might be true for gay marriage, but is nonsense in regards to financial regulation.

He wrote about it, and then proceeded to never actually provide or consider real world evidence in regards to his hypothesis.

Or, maybe invest in something that's actually productive and you know will be needed 20 years from now, energy, food production, pharmaceuticals etc etc

The title of his paper is "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
Seems pretty fucking clear he had a primary goal in mind, the goal being to make a monetary system.

The inventor of bitcoin disagrees. I'll go with his opinion over yours.

Probably marketing, lots and lots of marketing. 


Well there's a lot of different ways to tackle that, if bitcoin is getting jerked around by a bunch of renegade miners and the other coin isn't that would be a pretty convincing case to people to switch.

So you want them to call Bitcoin companies that hold people's wealth what they are(banks) and apply current financial regulations to them? Congratulations, you just requested more severe regulations.

Nope. Economists can actually cite millenia of human behavior. 


But had zero understanding of human behavior, which is the single most important thing to understand in real world economics. Mises's theories work great for a population of perfectly informed robots who all share the exact same rationality, but it crashes and burns when applied to human populations which are full of uninformed actors with thousands of contrasting views and ways of thinking. 
Sorry :)

So, it wasn't part of the punishment, it was part of paying the attorney he hired. That doesn't strike me as a problem. He used professional services, he should be expected to pay for it. People don't generally work for free. Of course if you can't pay who you hire you need to liquidate assets until you can, you don't have a right to not pay them fully. Otherwise get a cheaper lawyer or represent yourself.

Can you give me a source of some of these "serious analysts?"
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:35:46


I don't think you get that this is impossible. Wide acceptance and wide use by its very nature necessitates a higher price in order to handle the volume of wealth that would be needing to be transacted. You seem to have a fundamental lack of understanding of reality.

In the short term they'll be fine, in the long term, probably yeah, they'll fall under more regualtion. If history teaches anything it's that this nation's financial practices emanate from NY and are eventually copied in one way or another by the rest of the states. Texas doesn't have overtly lax financial regulation, just the opposite in fact, there's no reason to actually believe the state will in the long term avoid enacting any more controls over bitcoin because it's a state that's shown time and time again that it has no problem enacting ever increasing regulation over its financial institutions, regulation that mirrors the east coast. 
Hell, did you read the memo that Texas Banking Commissioner Charles G. Cooper released? And I quote....




They never said they have no plans ever, they said at this moment they are not enacting anything but will continue to monitor and are leaving open the possibility of taking action at a later date.

Unless someone releases a competing coin and wants people to freak out about the security of bitcoin and rush to their coin.

Asset forfeiture is used for money obtained from crime or to give restitution to victims. Given that OP has not said what his crime is then it's a poor assumption to just automatically think it's being used in this case. Most people going to prison are not forfeiting the entirety of their wealth. 
And in any case if it was being used against him this whole thing would be moot anyway. If he owes so much that they are coming after everything then upon release they're going to be watching him like a hawk and the second they see he is magically able to afford things he shouldn't be able to they're going to demand to see the source of the money and take it or drag him right back to prison.

Well, they would co-opt. They would borrow aspects of bitcoin for their own coin, kind of like what Filippino polititians are proposing to do with e-pesos

Actually it's primarily the bank. Banks operate checking accounts at a loss in order to attract people to them(That's called a "loss leader"). The majority of costs associated with a checking account, including insurance, are covered through revenue from other banking services as well as lending customer deposits. Fees make up a minority part of funding.

Are you under the impression that bitcoin is a market of some insurmountable amount of money? Lol. It's pocket change for major financial institutions. Google recently spent over $3 billion to buy a thermostat company and you're under the impression that billions is some scary number to major companies?

Why would they give a cut to miners and bitcoin processors if they don't have to? Why wouldn't they just continue being cash businesses if they are selling out anyway?

There is of course the possibility that this sub isn't a representative slice of who owns bitcoin. This sub has a great deal of ideological people who see bitcoin as more than an investment vehicle. 
I don't think that's necessarily true of the average person who bought bitcoin though. The average person who bought probably cares little for the ideological values expounded on here and just wants to make money, and bitcoin has done little since January to convince people it's going to make money moving forward.

FinCEN guidelines are only relevant at the federal level and only relevant to the small window of laws that FinCEN is tasked with enforcing. FinCEN for instance also requires banks to register as money transmitters, and that doesn't mean those banks avoid state regulatory standards. FinCEN means nothing to the states and their mountains of other financial regulations. If you want bitcoin to be slapped with traditional regulations then you're asking for more severe treatment. The NY Bitlicense is a lesser degree of what already exists.

The government doesn't seize your assets when you go to prison. You are still free to own financial assets while in prison.

A busy business would use a processor. No reason to not automate accounting and whatnot. 


But *why*?? Why bother if they are already throttled with customers. Most cash businesses I see are ones like restaurants who can't fit another soul through the door, bothering with another payment system wouldn't give them a dime of business more, so why bother?

Rush? What rush? Everyone already uses government currency. They're all already on board with the currency. People happily use the notes and coins issued by governments, why do you think they would be hesitant to use a digital issue of the currency they are already using?

The thing that is stupid is people trying to get rich quick on a massively speculated asset.
