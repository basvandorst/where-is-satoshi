As said. Depending on interest we are opening one in Birmingham. So it's not there (yet)

Look under "contact" on the website. We dont have a "founder team member" This is a small company with couple employees.

Why and how should we scam people? The whole transaction will take place in an office. We dont ask any front payment. Everyone is more then welcome to visit the office to meet us.

Yes their are allot of btc traders all over the world. So why do we stand out? 
Our exchange commission is lower than most traders and our trade volume is much higher than the average trader. We provide a private office with moneycounter, free drinks and for high volume customers even private taxi service.  So it's the whole experience what you pay for. 
The website is very basic because we have to comply to KYC &amp; AML policy rules of the exchanges we use. They requested we needed a website for our exchange. 
We have 4 offices now in Netherlands so thats why we are expanding to U.K. 
Feel free to make an appointment with me:)
