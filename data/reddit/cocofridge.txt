You are a certain kind of douchebag. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:46:40
Yes that would be interesting. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:19:36
Yes i am, or just if there are any complications in general. And look, i am totally for crypto implementations in our world. But right now I want to explore the hypothetical outcomes of it, or possible ways of such a transition.

Interesting video, and I catch your drift. Bitcoin was most likely created out of a such a perspective, but i'm trying to understand if there is a way for it to be "fit" into society as we know it today. Either way, interesting to see what will happen.

I see, and I know this is highly speculative, but would there not be any taxation on my paycheck then?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:45:15
So basically they would apply the same taxation system we have today only with bitcoin? And ofcourse it would be nice to see a currency that wasn't printed out of thin air, but wouldn't that mean that something withing the tax system changed in order to keep up with the countries expences? Like higher taxes?

Sure, I see what you mean and I agree that it certainly turns everything on its head. On the other hand governments have an enourmus amount of power and I belive that if it got to that point there would be laws made against the use of it. But if were to be realistic with the future use i'd think governments would try to adapt it into the current system thus compromising the complete usecase, while still keeping parts of the idea and tech.

@_date: 2017-10-20 06:31:12

@_date: 2017-10-20 13:48:52
What country? I could use swish and buy but for me thats a process that would take more than tqo weeks. :/

The future is here my friends.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:06:47
Hmm okej så man behöver alltså inte använda någon form av identifikation? Bara att skriva in kortnummer etc? Tack för tipset!
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:24:58

Most of the sites i visited used ID verifications, so I stopped there on those kind of sites. Got any sites where I can bypass?
Edit: BTW i live in Sweden.

If i understand it correctly the only way to buy bitcoins is through sites or meet-ups. Do you know any sites that dont require you to be 18 years of age?
