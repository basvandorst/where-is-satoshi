Not if you have given them that information.

We can be charitable, perhaps they meant that day was the lowest it will be in the next three years. :)

Hey guy from the future. Glad I didn't invest in Bitcoin it would be rough being rich now.

Why do we care how much money Binance makes off of shitcoin traders? It makes no difference to Bitcoin what a centralized exchange profits.

I would add to this, carry a gun.

They can print money to pay for things or to erase debts. If I owe you $1,000 and the amount of dollars in existence multiplies 1000 fold that $1,000 is the equivalent of $1 after the printing, and if I'm the government printing the money it cost me nothing to get the money I am paying you with. There is also the aspect of devaluing a national currency to make your nation's products cheaper to other nations.
Compare to Bitcoin, no one controls the supply, the increase in supply is at a known, slow, fixed rate. If I owe you one Bitcoin I can't make more to devalue it. The price of Bitcoin may fluctuate compared to other currencies, but I have to actually acquire a Bitcoin to pay you.
This gives governments far less control over the economy (unable to steal from the citizens by printing money) and hopefully makes for more conservative government spending, of course that assumes that Bitcoin becomes the global currency.

Cool idea, and possibly a good way to get use of the heat from mining.

I bought a million on eBay for around $20 a few months ago. They were new and sequential.

Unless Vitalik decides to roll that one back.

While there is that potential, it would be rather dangerous on their part. What if BCH went to $3,000 USD by January 1st? If they did as you suggest and sold at the until recent all time high they would have sold for something like $700 and would now have to buy back at $3,000. That's a lot of risk, and as a business avoiding losing a lot of money is probably more important than making a bit. Also, Coinbase likely has so much that if they were to sell it they would have to spread the sale out for a long period of time or crash the price, neither is beneficial to them.

I'm going to go with $9,816 USD.

That is correct. Though, it's probably most irrelevant at this point. It does make HitBTC seem rather shady though.

Give it a few years and they'll have to allow for transactions with smaller fractions. ��

Isn't that exactly what the one percent premine Gold did was?

Looking at this knowing there was a difference it took me a minute to spot the difference.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:17:43
Yes, the longer you wait the more likely it is to have lost value, but you also don't end up holding the wrong coin because you sold a day too soon. I think it would be wiser to hold and lose "free money" than sell right away and risk your investment.

I didn't see anything about mining Bitcoin there, just shit coins. It would be interesting to see an article about long term profit estimates based on assumptions of difficulty growth at different rates of electricity and potential Bitcoin valuations.

Electrum does, though you have to enable the feature. You don't set satoshi per byte, but total satoshis for some odd reason.
Look on  or similar to get an idea of how many satoshi per byte you should pay.

I think that is about typical for ACH transfers, and faster than wire transfers or credit cards. So, probably any use case where ACH transfers have been used traditionally.

HitBTC is. In fact you can sell the B2X futures now, though for the life of me I can't figure out how to do it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:35:44
Well, if you can buy someone is selling somehow, right?

I predict 0.01 btc by end of next week. Barely worth the hassle of selling it.

Their Facebook rep answered me. 
"Those are IOU (I owe you) trades. IOU means that our traders are not buying actual coins yet, but they are buying futures. Then our partners – verified market makers – will buy exact amount of coins, bought by our traders, to fund them as soon as tokens will be released."

Trace the transaction history to when it was bought on a centralized exchange with KYC in place. While there are ways to avoid that, I doubt most put in that effort.

I had ETH in Coinbase when the hard fork occurred. Coinbase emailed the users to tell them to get it out by a certain cut-off date.
I wish they would have added support for ETC at the time, but instead they said it had to be moved out.

Yeah, you have a chance of making money, and significant chance of losing money. If you automate it, you can do it quickly!
Is there that much of a price difference between them?
Right now it looks like there is a $7 difference per coin. You put $1800 in and make $7 minus transaction fees. I suppose there is a profit there, but for it to be reasonable, you have to exchange a lot of money.

They can't seem to figure out how to read a photo for my verification, so I gave up. A coworker did make it through, it only took a month of trying.
