you received lots of tiny amounts in your wallet? combining lots of small transactions into one outgoing transaction makes it larger, and costs more sadly. you will be better off waiting. for how long? who knows...

GDAX eats all withdrawal fees. if you transferred from GDAX to Blockchain, GDAX paid all fees. If you transferred from Coinbase to Blockchain, YOU paid the fees. pretty straightforward.

BTC is very slow when it comes to implementing changes. LTC will most likely implement LN first when the code is finished Beta testing, as it did with Segwit. LN will still have a max user amount, i've seen 500million users. so LTC will still fill the void for cheaper transactions, even on LN, as we approach mass adoption.

transfer to GDAX. same site.

such as a Trezor, apparently

damn, that sucks dude. Did you not know that Bittrex was a U.S. based exchange? I have sympathy, but shit, you should have known better.

happens all the time. keep trying to transfer back and forth from main to trading. that worked for me once or twice. otherwise, you'll have to wait hours for their customer service. but don't freak out, your funds are there.

Depends on how backed up the mempool is...sometimes people wait for days to get into a block, depending on the size of the fee they entered. How is that for efficiency?

I misspoke. I basically was refuting the guy above, thinking that anyone will remain on 1x chain, but you are correct. Hardfork to 2MB in November.

It's like the matrix. When the time comes, you won't have to sell your coins at all. People are already buying things with them. Cars, homes, renting properties airbnb style. Eventually you won't need exchanges to be the offramp.

Is it your spidy sense?

maybe not that long, current minimum is 546 satoshi. as the value increases, there may be need to increase the min transaction size. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:19:05
Any wallet that you control (not an exchange) will make sure you get credited B2X to the same address on the new chain. If you keep your coins on an exchange, the exchange controls the address keys, so they decide if they want to credit your account with B2X or not.

Split your finite money into 2 or more smaller buys

Correct. You can hold for as long as you want.

opening apps is hard. he was sending to himself, so maybe it looked that way. he technically did all 4 sides of the 2 transactions. in the real world, you will only do 25% of what he did in the video to complete a transaction.

Miners who are signalling in favor of the New York Agreement, in each block they mine. Over 80% of miners are signalling their intention to mine Segwit 2X chain, but signalling is not binding.

no. has nothing to do with that.

It has use if you want to be able to transact without a bank's permission, and on a faster timeframe.

the only people who have verified accounts to wire money in are very big players. that's not for regular Joes.

Yeah, basically, or you can scan a QR code on your phone with your wallet address built into it.

i think the proliferation of smart phones says otherwise. bank custody is a mistake IMO.
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:05:06
not for the fees they're charging. won't even make a dent in adoption until the fees come WAY down. 4% PLUS the spread, which i'm sure will be another 2-5%

maybe at first, but information will find it's way out eventually. especially for something that's public domain already. research typically runs in parallel, so if one person is trying to crack some form of encryption, you can bet others are trying as well. can't silence everybody.

losing miners is not a good thing, but it's also not catastrophic by default.

government shutdown, CFTC might not certify in time. that's why it's a "possible" delay.

Cash App on iOS or Android are pretty easy
Coinbase Pro (so you can avoid fees on Coinbase, if you use limit orders - understand them before you try to use them, it's the pro side of Coinbase)

"cost to mine" is a moving target. if the price drops, miners close up shop, difficulty drops, new cost to mine drops, profit margin for miners who remain increases. if price rises, more miners/hash turns on, difficulty rises, cost to mine rises, profit margin shrinks. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 21:55:53
Well said.
@_date: 2018-12-13 04:41:23
how could they possibly enforce that? think about it. but yeah, if coinbase doesn't want to give you your coins, they can do that. you don't own the bitcoin in your account on Coinbase, that's just an IOU
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:35:21
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:28:27
it would require funds to actually own bitcoin, turning them into huge buyers, drying up supply, and potentially forcing the price up due to supply/demand economics.
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:46:19
how is it unreliable and crippled?
@_date: 2018-12-31 21:55:20
That's true.
