Oh, so that's what's taking weeks? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:08:35
I'll be sure to let you know lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:47
All I can say is, it's a good thing I have diversified myself with other coins...wait, shit
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:30:30
I got it in my email today 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:36:29
Cashing out
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:59:29
Great, thank you. I just needed confirmation of this, thanks
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:13:56
Well, seemingly predictable, but yeah direction.  It goes up to 14.5k than goes down to 13k, then back up to 14k. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:49:22
I have some, I particularly like Geocoin, you have any suggestions? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:17
Right! I'll take a gajillion of your finest bch please
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:18:11
With coinbase, you can buy with a bank transfer and it does take a while BUT when it goes through you still get the price it was at when you started the transfer.    
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:25:51
Nope. I almost did that, but I was worried even I would forget my code

Ha - in that regard he would be brother in science teacher
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:44:28
Do you have an older account? Mine is new, well about a month old now.   The problem is the verification, if you pass, great if you don't pass you're screwed so its a gamble. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:14:44
Yeah, it seems there is a debate over whether or not they are fungible.  It's frustrating that there isn't a hard resource for this, just a bunch of sites basically giving opinions.  
I've been looking around for a couple hours and if I assume they are fungible than it seems you just need to pick an accounting method:    
Average cost method: The costs of different batches of products are averaged to determine cost of goods sold expense and ending inventory cost.   
First-in, first-out (FIFO) method: The costs of batches are charged to cost of goods sold in the order the batches are acquired, and the cost of ending inventory is from the most recent batch(es) acquired.    
  
Last-in, first-out (LIFO) method: The costs of batches are charged to cost of goods sold in the reverse order that the batches were acquired, and the cost of ending inventory is from the oldest batch(es) acquired.    
I'm still stuck on why the original price doesn't matter as AnimalXP said, because you'd need to know how much you gained no matter what method you use.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:34
Not sure why your being an ass, but if that makes you feel like a big man than great 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:58:36
Yes. Verify first if you're going to use the service.  However, there are some people that needed to redo their verification randomly after already having an established account.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:03:21
Hey, I also applied but we have a relatable cause so I thought I comment.  If nothing else, I'd love to connect with your friend.  My sisters and I lost our father to suicide when we were kids.  We started  [Camp Kita]( to help young survivors of suicide, we just finished our fourth season.     
We charge nothing to attend camp, everyone is a volunteer, all money goes directly to the program and we have had some awesome results.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:06:11
Yeah, that's where it gets stuck.  It either goes right through or it won't and you'll be stuck for at best a month.  Luckily I didn't transfer in a ton of coin.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:03:03
Yeah on canvas 12x24
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:12:17
Where are these rules? All I can find are blogs with various opinions, nothing official
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:07:25
Thanks, I did keep a copy but I kinda hope I lose it/forget about it and a hundred years from now somebody finds my amateur art at goodwill for $1 not realizing it's worth millions...
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:55:37
Awe yes, that will make telling them that much better. How dare they throw away a gift from me! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:18:39
No no, it's been a couple days sense my bitch post.   It took almost three weeks 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:01:59
What I don't understand is when you make a trade from one currency to another, the values in that moment are the same as it relates to the dollar.  So you didn't make any money by switching currencies, so there is nothing to pay taxes on.  Sure the trade might prove quickly profitable but not at the instant of he trade.  Without like kind, it's like selling to USD first than using that usd to buy a different coin. T
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:59:34
I posted about this just yesterday and got downvoted to hell.  I hope Bittrex gets their act together, and I hope your funds (and mine) get unlocked.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:45:07
I did notice that there is no hash id in Gdax yet, and there are on my previous transfers.  It says complete but I wonder if that means that it really isnt.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:06:47
I bought them through coinbase/gdax, 90% is cold storage and 10% left on the exchange.  
I didn't realize coinbase automatically uses FIFO, so thats interesting.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:04:35
I can't find anything which defines FIFO as the system to use, everything just says record your purchase and your sale. This is why I ask the question if you have a resource you got your info from that would be awesome.   
If I buy five different cars, and I want to sell one of the cars, I can choose which one I sell.  If I buy five different Bitcoins or fractions of a Bitcoin, why can't I choose which one I sell?   
Cars are property, and Bitcoin is considered property in the eyes of the IRS.   
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:26:33
Just applied and thanks for the opportunity: 
[Camp Kita](    
Here is our vision statement:   
To provide a safe, nurturing environment where child survivors can connect with one another while learning constructive ways to deal with the often unspeakable and fierce emotion of losing a parent to suicide. By creating a space for child survivors, we effectively ease the stigma around what it means to have lost a parent to suicide. The campers’ shared loss and experience grants them the opportunity to form deep, knowing bonds with others and thereby forging supportive connections that we hope will last a lifetime. As a community of survivors, our week-long focus will be to provide and explore constructive forms of self-expression. We will practice self-awareness as a way of identifying feelings and communicating them in a focused way.  Our focus on grief—on shattering apart—will dovetail with an equally significant focus on hope—the power and purpose of piercing oneself together. Most importantly, we will empower campers to utilize the tools and resources we provide so that they may draw upon them throughout their lives.

I'm one of the founders. Camp Kita is a camp for children who have lost someone to suicide. I'll have them set up a wallet tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:12:31
It's written in small lettering on the top of the wooden frame on the back. You'd need to know where to look and know what you're looking at. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:51
Oblivious to what? A broken verification system on a popular exchange? I transferred in a little bitcoin to use their service and it is stuck there, and there is no customer service to speak of...I thought I'd warn other people.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:31:50
Right, it says complete on Gdax though the time for estimated payout is always changing to the current time. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:31:19
Yeah, true. I don't have much there anyway, I keep most in my offline wallet and gdax I just wanted to buy some vertcoin.  There are some people with a decent amount tied up though so I figured I'd post.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:30:53
I couldn't get my order to go through at 10800, finally got it to go through at 12,700 :( 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:52:12
Thanks, that makes me feel better.  I'll just be sitting here hitting refresh
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:47:38
Oh I'm sure, I wish it were that easy - check out their facebook page, they have a sticky at the top pushing people to zendesk but there are 4100 comments of people having issues with no help 
  
 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:59
TIL Grey's Anatomy is still a thing 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:27:55
I bought on the dip, but I was really hoping it would last just a few more days so I'd have more money in my Gdax account.  It takes so long to transfer money
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:19:58
By chewed up, do you mean people cancel their sell orders? But just to make sure I am understanding the chart right, if we pretend all these orders hold, the price would drop until an equal number of buy orders go through right?  
@_date: 2019-12-26 23:36:58
You will get liquidated if your losses exceed what you have to back it up in your account. So at 100x and a small account balance it’s easy for a downswing to exceed what’s in your account.  
If you invest 100 with a 100x leverage, and the market goes down 1% your already at a $100 loss and you’ll be stopped out. That’s not even including fees, sooo it’s actually less than that.

Still a great idea, you click once, forget about it and they are basically running legal malware.    
Or you could do what I do and X out because I hate sites that tell me to turn off ad blocker 
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:32:10
I'm in the US. My assumption is that I would pay taxes when I either convert it to dollars or buy goods. 
Edit :This would be on any gains, above the value of the sale 
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:09:28
What about breadwallet? I like that it's on my phone and was pretty easy to setup/ make a backup phrase. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:54:38
How do you cash out when the time comes? I also downloaded Coinbase before I started this thread and there is an obvious buy and sell option.  I don't see where you would deposit it as dollars with breadwallet.
