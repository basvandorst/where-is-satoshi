Kraken just upgraded it servers. u should be happy about a nice and hopefully stable exchange with no trading fees until feb. They are overthrown with tickets. on status.kraken and blog.kraken they mentioned that deposits are going to take longer than normal for some time now.... So keep calm and enjoy trading.

Dude split it, do not invest all and be aware that you can loose much. You can also invest in other coins that have huge potential. Checkout ripple for that. This is just an advice. It is all own your responsibility. 
I know this is r/Bitcoin. But to spread is always a good option. Please dont downvote to hard :D

"stay away". Bitcoin is by far more risky then a Ripple investment. Just look how slow it is and how high the fees are.. Bitcoin is a great idea and I love the community and those stuff. But you have to stick to the reality.. Bitcoin is not going to replace all Fiat..
I am just advising you to look into different Coins too and split your investment.... You can start by investing 50-1000$ into coins you believe have a potential. You could invest this amount into bitcoin.. But to double your profit with Bitcoin, it would need to hit almost 40k. Could happend, yes for sure. But have a look at EthLend, KIN, Ripple, Mana, Ethereum, etc. etc. The chance that Ethlend will grow from 7Cent to 14 Cent seems to be much higher. Because it has a product, you can use the product, and it just got listet on Binance. Forsure there are many many many shitcoins. I dont know the future. Invest in the coin which you believe can grow...
And yes Ripple can grow and probably will. Maybe maybe not. no one knows for sure. But it is likely to double your investment.

Thanks for the explanation. I think the FOMO could get many people into real trouble. I am not saying it will crash, but it is still risky. People shouldn't spend money they need. But people are getting stupid while beeing in a coinrush.... Like in a casino

You could also donate something for the animals. Or just buy one of those mass "production" places, to save some poor animals.
I am really sick of this world.
I mean we are human, but due to manipulation and some crappy ads, we all tend to forget how people, animals and the enviroment is getting destroyed by us. 
Just look at those crappy companies like:
Glencore or Monsanto or Nestle or or or... 
There are so many. They are profiting on someone suffering. 
I am not a politcal activist nor a communist or some stuff like that. I am just pointing to the truth. 
We need to change.... 
It is always good to know, that there are people like you out there... Thank you!

Not for the "Girokonto". The bank is not allowed to touch or use any penny you store in the Girokonto. But  most banks you have to pay for it and there are no profits. But your money is yours in this case.
