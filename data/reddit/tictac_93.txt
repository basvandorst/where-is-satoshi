There's no way you could have known how much it'd appreciate.  I had a handful of BTC back in 2012 or so, when it was fluctuating between $7/BTC and $15/BTC; it had been staying in that range for so long that I never even considered the possibility of a massive inflation.  I don't think anyone did, really.
Still, it sounds like you probably have a good chunk of change lying around.  Last I checked, BTC was trading at close to $1k / BTC... You're still making out like a bandit.

They're traded for national currencies, like stocks.  Their value is tied to that, it's pretty much whatever people are willing to pay for it.
It's usually somewhat stable, but every now and then it fluctuates wildly and re-stabilizes at a new exchange rate.

I'm always jealous of these stories.  I first bought btc when it was ~$17, but back then it was so stable that I never even considered investing in it...  Oh well ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/ ¯

.01btc/kB (.002btc for the actual fee) got a recent transaction of mine added to the next block, less than that would almost certainly be fine if you're not in a big rush to move them.

Eh, I just spent my morning reading up on all of this and it's a bit confusing but not necessarily scary.  It seems like as a user, just sit tight through the late-July / early-August turbulence and then resync to whatever chain came out on top afterwards.
My main concern is that this goes over smoothly and doesn't tank the value of BTC, it's appreciated a lot since I last opened my wallet and free money's always nice.

I figured, but I wanted to make sure this went through as quickly as possible.  I normally set my fees pretty low and just let it take the hour or so to confirm.

I used a fee of .01btc/kB, which ended up being .002btc for the transaction and got added to the very next block.  Less should work fine, especially if you're not in a huge rush.

Right, I haven't been.  I haven't so much as thought about bitcoin in over a year, and it's been far longer since I really kept myself appraised of its details.  My point being, I think that the news bullitin was urgent enough to get those of us who are out of the loop to do some research, while still being far from doomsday alarmist hyperbole.
