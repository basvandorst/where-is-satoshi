In between Hong Kong , Norway and Bangladesh. A socialist utopia, a capitalist utopia and a perpetually sinking dystopia. Two out of three is good enough for me to shit on this shitpost.

That's the even more rage inducing part, that the MAJORITY of you are good, knowledgeable and socially and politically conscious human beings. Yet, you let a corrupt, racist, psychopathic, genocidal (I mean this literally), fascist minority of ISIS and Satan's love children rule your political process and hold back progress for not just your own country but for the world. I hate you non-idiots even more, because in any sane, decent country, there would have been a revolution far earlier where degenerates like Mitch fuck-the-first-responders McConnell would be hanging in the city square from meat hooks, upside down.

How is Rand Paulitician better than Bernie been-fighting-the-good-fight-for-three-decades-and-has-the-fucking-record-to-back-it-up Sanders? You Americans are like children who don't know at all what's good for you and the world.
Edit: for a community of trustless protocol enthusiasts, it's ironic how much of a hard-on some of you shitwits have for a run-of-the-mill, bought-out politician. Haha.

But being forced to give your property to the state to redistribute to apocalypse inducing corporations and financial jihadists is A-OK? That's what a vote for establishment politicians, of which Rand Paul is totally a part of, means. You'd have to be blind or desperately naive to not see the difference between the elder, honest Paul and the younger, hollow, politician Paul. 
Your reasoning is shaky without even going into your unexamined definition of "your property".

Love that subtle switch - Bitcoin is now bitcoin and blockchain is now Blockchain.

Please elaborate on what 'liberty' means to you exactly.

I would pay double for them without the B logo. Those look *awesome.*

Satoshi is dead. Satoshi remains dead. And We we will bring him back.

I've always maintained that extremely simple remittance will be one of the top 5 killer apps for bitcoin. now just make an app to simplify even further. best of luck from hong kong.

Elons not actually that big of a fan of bitcoin.

HOOOOONGG Kong here. Sent you a Pee Em.

It's pretty obvious that we should take a hint from this. 
Great idea, but maybe hold off for 10 years?

Rakuten is also planning to accept btc I believe.

It's sad to see the what a conspiracy minded swamp this place is. Sad to know that I share in this interest with them. Just in case you're wondering who cares it's the enemies of the open society. The idea, the ideas of Popper's book and most importantly the 20B$ OS foundations that's quite rightly in my opinion trying to open up every closed society which the government's of those societies also quite reasonably deem as a national security threat. A 30min cursory googling about will give you a basic idea and confirm what I'm saying, that is if you're an otherwise sane person.

Really want more details about how they did this...

Unnonstop this at once!

The change in institutional attitude towards Bitcoin from early 2013 till now is cartoonishly similar to this quote. 








It really pisses me off that no apologies were offered between step two and three. 
"Sorry, we thought you were all loonies, our bad. We're just too fucking slow and ossified to understand new technologies even though we've seen the same thing over and over again with the telephone, automobile, the airplane, the internet and electric cars. Really. Very. Sorry. Yeah we don't know why everyone listens to us or gives us all their money to manage either. Again, ever so sorry."

I find it rather suspect. Bitcoin is bringing together conservative, pro-MIC think tanks like this, extreme left anarchists and nearly everyone in the middle. 
Never thought I'd live to see the day business, state and the proles agreeing on something.

So much cringe, yet it fully captures every reason for my love of Bitcoin. Someone cover this with an electric guitar and bluesy vocals stat!

Confirmed scam. From Hong Kong and their 'office' was walking distance....found out the office they mentioned is actually ikea's hong kong office.
