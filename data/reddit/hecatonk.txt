Ok I've studied this a little more, and now I'm still confused by your statement here. BIP 101 has certain rules for how the blocksize maximum size can grow. If some miners decided to "vote" for a blocksize that was larger then the size allowed by bip100, and mined a block of that large size, then it would cause a hard-fork, not a soft-fork, as I understand it. Maybe you can explain the logic behind your statement that bip100 could be implemented as a soft-fork on a network that has implemented 101?

If it's decentralized, how does the network handle the usage case where I alter the client to disagree about the rules for transaction verification? This causes a network split and people have no choice then but to seek out the "authority" who can tell them which version to run.

I was excited to see this was done in the style of art nouveau, however it's not really done in the style of Mucha, which I found dissapointing. Mucha, the creator of the art nouveau movement, was meticulous with his detailed and intricate lines. In fact, that's one of the things that really set him apart from all other artists, his unique detailed plate-printing methods were like his signature. The subject matter and feel of the painting is consistent, but it feels "washed-out" in comparison to most art nouveau pieces.

Dynamic means "no blocksize limit" because it can be gamed. Would drive up storage costs and network usage artificially because it creates an incentive for big pools to generate blocks as big as possible.

None of this is true, tone down your advertising. I don't see how this "runs on bitcoin" at all, or why that would be desireable. I won't even look at it because you have thrown anonymity to the wind, just like all the other p2p marketplace designers.

Ok but the data you are embedding into the blockchain, I'm guessing into OP_RETURN, is in no way validated by the bitcoin nodes or authenticated in any way by their hashing power. It's really a sidechain implementation at best, and thus vulnerable to Cybil attack and centralization enforced by an "official authority". Why should everyone on Earth store your OP_RETURN data forever? Because that's what you are asking all node maintainers to do, to support your p2p marketplace experiment. I'd liken this to bitcoin "maximalism", or even blockchain spam. I just don't see a compelling reason why you should be using the blockchain as your communications mechanism. It's slow, has terrible communications limitations, and wasn't designed for this purpose. You don't need a POW system to verify entries in a ledger unless the POW is actually verifying the entries *you are interested in the ledger*, and attaching to a 3rd-party POW just seems like bad engineering to me unless you can tell me a compelling reason it should be done this way. A better implementation would just be a "myMarketPlaceCoin" and have the market directly built into the client and the marketplace transactions *actually validated* by the miners in some way, through some sort of smart-contract / oracle system. Something like Ethereum would make a more logical choice to build this platform on, it seems.

Ok, but I would have needed a 200+% increase in salary to maintain the same standard of living there. Maybe if I could have lived in a smaller city near Zug canton it could have been cheaper, but the visa rules limit employees of Zug companies to living in Zug canton.
Of course there are no countries that are truly "friendly" to Austrian economics, but the Swiss seem like old-school traditionalist bankers who specifically have a system that will be extra-resistant, as opposed to the developing countries in Indochina for example.

You are mistaken, or just lying. The bitcoin nodes *in no way* verify any of the transaction data, or anything at all within OP_RETURN.

BS, does nothing to help the economy. Where did that money come from? Printed out of nowhere, that's where. It's theft. It's immoral for one man to print money when another man works for it. It's just a giveaway to his friends in solar and wind. Nuclear is the future and anyone still pushing solar and wind is just a blowhard shining sun up your ass. 


I am opposed to public property and public schools. I believe that men can find ways to pave straight lines of asphalt and educate their children without funding those programs via forced expropriation of wealth. The ends don't justify the means. I know that is a hard concept for some people, but it's true. No social system funded by the use of force can ever be moral. I would have a very hard time supporting any system funded via taxation, or any candidate who is not ideologically opposed to taxation in all forms. I am philosophically opposed to the initiation of physical force against another human in any context, for any reason. I believe that all interactions between men must be *voluntary* in order to be ethical, and I hold individual rights as the central guiding principle to a moral government. Bernie supports taxation, supports redistributing wealth by force, and doesn't seem to even understand what individual rights even are. His viewpoint literally is a lot closer to that of Stalin than to that of Americas Founding Fathers.


I may vote for Rand Paul if he makes the ballot in my state, but honestly I don't really believe that voting matters or that America is a representative democracy anymore, it's pretty clearly a fascist plutarchy at this point. I think the last American election was about as legitimate as the last Iranian election. I will not even consider voting for any of the others, it would be merely the sanction of the victim. The only way I would ever vote for Bernie would be from the rooftops. I believe the only reason you support him is because your family has never had to escape for their lives from a socialist regime. You live in a candy-coated dreamworld.

It shouldn't. There is no reason why every single microtransaction ever performed by every person in the world needs to be stored permanently on every full node. The lack of any form of safe deletion mechanism is one of the main weaknesses of the blockchain ledger storage system.

I think that the fact that DEA agents had access to the hot wallets and were using their fake SR admin accounts for criminal activities is pretty fucking relevant. It pretty much destroys the prosecution's chain of evidence of Ross's bitcoins on that laptop they seized from him.

I don't really think such things are necessary, and I'd have a big problem with probably anyone's definition of what "spam" is. Historically, Luke Jr. tried to implement "coinvalidation" on the lesser-used linux library repos that he was building, so he could filter out all of Eric Vorhees' transactions and call them "spam". The more interesting issue for me is what happens when the block reward is so low and the blocksize so large that there is incentive for the miners to actually start collaborating to self-impose a smaller blocksize limit in order to drive users to pay higher fees to get their tx into the next block. Also, I do think the statistics of real-time network propogation will play a role, but only in the sense that it will limit how big miners will be willing to make their blocks, risking "staleness" that it could take too long to propogate before a new empty block could be found and enter a race condition for validity. Also, the mempool has issues that need to be addressed, so that's where these "spammy/ddos" transactions really start to hurt the network. Honestly I would not be opposed to just routing all transactions smaller than some qualifier into a sidechain, but I know that would cause a huge uproar among "purists".

This is everything that is wrong with Reddit in a nutshell. This actually has little to do with bitcoin, in my mind. Reddit has a broken moderator system, that enables and fosters a culture of censorship and punishes new or dissenting opinions. This is often abused and becomes outright codified subjugation and racial bias against groups of people based on their ideology or cultural/genetic identities. Note that no sub-reddits whose members oppose anarchy is listed in the sidebar of This is why Reddit will not last, and will become the next Digg.
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:02:13
The fact that Ross's prosecution was not allowed to bring this up at his trail really screams "mistrial" to me. The fact that federal agents had access to the SR hot wallets and were impersonating admins seems like it would have been very relevant information regarding Ross's claim that he was being manipulated by others.

I predict these companies will waste a lot of money and look very foolish when it becomes very clear that their "blockchain" tech is worthless without a cryptocurrency and a community that supports it.
