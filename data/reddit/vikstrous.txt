Sounds like the attacker would have only a linear disadvantage.
Edit: After reading a bit more, I'm very confused about who builds the "future" links in the chain and embeds rewards for unlocking them. Whoever does this needs linearly comparable compute power to the fastest time chain unlocker. That's not infeasible, but I don't see the economic incentive there.

I was thinking of building something like this, but I want to build it in a decentralized way. That basically means that there is no way to impose fees on using the service. Of course, it would be recommended to donate a non-zero amount to fund the development of the project.

That might require your DNA to sign a cryptographic token. I'm not sure if we are there yet. :P

Were you address and name supposed to be public in the whois record or is that an accident? In any case I'm having difficulties finding this address on Google maps, which makes me wonder if it exists.

Is it possible for someone to trademark it on behalf of Satoshi Nakamoto?

Am I the only one who can't answer this? Oh, god, did I just fail a Turing test? If I was a computer and guessed I'd have a 25% chance to be right, but admitting I'm wrong gives me a 0% chance. :(

Kickstarter funding is not an investment. It's a donation.

If this IS to be used as a drug, it's definitely not any drug I'd try. From the description: "! NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, DO NOT INJECT, INGEST, INSUFFALATE OR INHALE THIS PRODUCT, IF SWALLOWED SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION, NOT FOR SALE TO MINORS"

I don't need soap, but that grapefruit is making me hungry.
