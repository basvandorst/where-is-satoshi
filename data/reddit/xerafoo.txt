Bitstamp.net does BTC to fiat. I've used them for years and they are very reliable. And they are in the UK.

I bought  ( very modest investment when 999 out of 1000 people never hear the word Bitcoin) when they are $15 each in 2011 and freaked out when they went down to $8. Friends gave me crap that I didn't sell when they were up to $1200 and then crashed to $200.  I've sold off some along the way and converted some to XRP when they were less than 1¢ each. 
I tried to time the "dip" when they were a few thousand each and sold 3 when they were roughly $4000. This madness will continue so hold on. 
I don't think it's smart to sell unless you need the money. Nevermind the pending tax ramifications..
I'm in it for an even longer hold now.

I sat on mine in 2011 and they hatched me a paid off house this month!

I'm in the same boat as you. I have enough to pay off my house and have some left over to keep in the market. I bought $500 worth of Bitcoin in 2010 for $15 each and moved a bunch into ripple in 2012.
 I was hesitant to sell enough to pay off the house, even at the ATH. A friend told me "pull out enough to pay off your house" I replied, "why?" 
I'll never forget what he said...
"No matter what happens, you'll always be the guy who paid off his house with $500 worth of Bitcoin!"
I pulled out enough last week and it will be paid off by the end of the month.
Cheers!
