The only problem with LN is that it is still need on-chain transactions. You either accumulate wealth or spend it. So you need to make transactions to increase / decrease, you need to open and close channels. 1MB+SW+LN can not even serve 100 million users.

Agree on (2), 2MB/4MB is meaningless. But not with (1). Look, most of people either accumulate new savings or spend it. If you accumulate you need to regularly transfer fiat/alts to your main savings account (on-chain). If you live on your savings you need to top-up your LN wallet from on-chain savings Bitcoin account. How this is gonna happen? I am in long standing love with Bitcoin but this scalability ussue worries me :)

But how to support opening/closing channels? Each user needs at least 1 on-chain tx. I see main chain as bank system. And LN channels as bank accounts

What if I live on my savings which are in bitcoin? So there is only one way to top-up balance - via on-chain transaction.

BTC has almost lasted for 10 years. It is kind of proven software, not experimental.

Yeap. See it the same way. I have some savings accounts, two mine checking accounts and my wife has 3 as well. I top them up once in 1-3 months.

What do you mean? Supposed increase to 2MB was too small?

The first (1) way will actually make bitcoin obsolete with the time. 
Second (2) way does not exist because consensus failed last time. Each extra attempt will be harder to implement.

What if I live on my savings and hold my savings in bitcoin on-chain :)?
