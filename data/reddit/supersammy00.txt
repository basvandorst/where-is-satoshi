If bitcoin gets destroyed or lost it just makes the rest more valuable. If we are left with only one bitcoin at some point we can just add more digits so that people can still have the same percentage of the bitcoin supply but with less actual coins.

The benefits of running a lightning node is that you can use the lightning network. Currently you need a node but in the future I think you will be able to use light clients.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:32:38
If it doesnt connect to a node you will never see your balance. Transaction history is not stored locally unless you are running a node.

That would be better but some node seems to be rebroadcasting transactions. This isn't the miners fault. All the miners see is that someone is broadcasting the transaction so they keep it in their mempool just like all other transactions that are purposefully getting rebroadcasted. RBF is a solution to this problem btw.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:48:21
The difficulty and mempool are completely separate. The difficulty dictates the frequency of blocks, on average ten minutes, and the mempool is how many transactions could not be fit into the block because it was completely full. There is no way for miners to put more transactions in a block. There is a way for people sending transactions to make them smaller by using segwit addresses but there is nothing more the miners can do.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:50:35
You can do a bank transfer at a lot of exchanges.

There are lots of these transactions with lots of segwit inputs.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:24:44
The problem now is that F2Pool and Antpool won't put transactions into blocks with less then 5 sat/byte
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:50:09

@_date: 2018-01-27 00:23:55
We're not celebrating we are just telling people the current state of the mempool. Right now you don't need to send 1000 sat/byte transactions you can send 10sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:20:26
So your friend thinks Bitcoin is worthless because of its technology but suggests you put your money into Litecoin which uses all the same technology. The only difference is the price graphs but if you zoom out even a month you will see Bitcoin is still up. Every time we reach a new ATH it will dip because ATH isn't sustainable just like every price graph.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:19:01
What does the private sidechain mean? Is it another blockchain behind the scene and you can receive and spend real btc with lightning that interacts with this private sidechain?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:32:28
The network is doing fine. There's like 200k nodes so that means there's like 88k nodes run by individuals.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:06:50
The backlog of transactions have been getting processed. We are have completely clear all transactions from the backlog at 30+ sat/byte. The mempool went up a little after but those are all new transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:37:51
Rootstock sidechain just started and have done the first transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:02:59
Increasing the hashrate won't unclog the system. The system is designed to have blocks every ten minutes and it will always be that way. If you don't believe me look at the graphs the hashrate is double what it was just a couple months ago.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:01:30
Have you asked the merchant to send the address again it might not have been your mistake.
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:52:20
In your title you said we need more nodes run by individuals. We are perfectly healthy right now more nodes is always better but there is no need for them.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:55:03
I think it's 0.13 btc so $1000 is possible and I think someone already has a channel that big. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:11:07
It's already at 1 btc.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:25:51
The mempool is still going down and will continue for at least 4 more days which is when the next difficulty adjustment is. When that happens I'm not sure if it will go up or down but having this backlog cleared is great. In just the last week the mempool has gone down 120MB out of 280MB total. The last 160MB are transactions below 30 sat/byte and last week at 280MB transactions were 140 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:56:31
Running a full node isn't super easy anymore but it's still not very hard it just takes some time. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:56:58
The coins came from block 9 but the first transaction to that address was at block 170. These are the 10 coins Satoshi sent to Hal.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:42:27
Segwit works the same.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:19:07
There is no changing of inputs. For the transaction you described input a with 4 btc + input b with 3 btc will be spent and those inputs can never be used ever again. What will also happen in that transaction will be two new inputs created input c with 5 btc and input D with two btc. Each bitcoin block is made up of these transactions saying how the inputs are spent and can't be used again and at the same time how the new inputs are created. An input can never be changed but it can be spent and create a new input in the process.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:12:25
Running a full node would be great. Trying out the lightning testnet would also be great. Mining bitcoin on your mac will unfortunately never yield a payout. Cloud mining is not a good idea either it would be more profitable to just buy and hold bitcoin with the same amount of fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:46:34
If the whole network used segwit we would be able to process a lot more transactions. Segwit is an option blocksize increase.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:45:16
It is not easy getting a mainnet node working yet. If you would like to try the technology try out the testnet but I would suggest you wait for the mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:46:43
Hashrate is still increasing.
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:47:39
Wow Monday was spot on.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:36:43
Yes adding more hashrate does increase capacity slightly but that has never been a solution to scaling because it is relatively insignificant. A better solution would be to adopt segwit which is a long term solution. If segwit adoption was at 100% the mempool would be clear in just a few days.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:18:17
It just means they got lucky. If there was some way to mine 5 blocks in a row everyone would be doing it because that is like 1.5 million dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:20:18
That's still 9.6 extra blocks per day.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:58:14
Ethereum sounds like it's already having serious at this scale how is it gonna handle that scale?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:55:51
I don't think they are mining segwit blocks. I checked their block history and it was all under 1MB.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:25:08
It is too experimental for them to release a main net wallet. If you have enough technical skill you can get around it though but I wouldn't try.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:26:01
The blocks were just close enough together they didn't have time to prepare the transactions yet that's all. There is time in between where they need to still be mining something even though the next block isn't filled yet so they just use an empty block until they can put the transactions in.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:07:12
The funds need to be in a segwit address but to be able to use the lightning network the wallet applications still needs to add the functionality.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:03:13
Segwit is working but adoption is only at 10% right now. Lightning is in the testing phase. You can try it on the testnet and there have been some tests on the main net as well but it's still too risky and needs more testing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:14:43
I'm not sure what you are exactly referring to but there website does have SSL right now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:53:04
But we don't have bigger blocks now is the problem. Not everyone can just stop sending transactions so a lot of people are losing money because of the high fees right now. I think once we get proper segwit support the fees will be reasonable again but right now not many wallets support it and neither do exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:50:54
Wow that's pretty bad. I'm don't know if that is fixed or not.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:41:20
Lightning is technically working now. There have been mainnet transactions but for a reasonable launch adoption will be required.
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:48:10
If you want to be sure test it a couple times each time the likely hood of it is decreased by 50 times. Testing it 5 times would result in a 1 in 312,500,000 chance of incorrectly identifying the same link each time.

When Lightning is fully implemented all of this will be done automatically by your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:47:14
It is not just the miners. Exchanges which generate a large amount of transactions are still not using segwit transactions. The segwit transaction percentage is only about 10%. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:55:21
FIRST STEP: BACK IT UP! You don't want to lose your coins trying to get them back so make sure the first thing you do is make a backup of the wallet.dat file.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:11:38
Lightning is working as a technology but the user experience is still very much in development. I've been trying it out on the testnet and I it is definitely not ready. As for segwit there is nothing you need to learn the only change is to the address format from beginning with a "1" to either "bc1" or "3" other than that it is still exactly the same. The problem with segwit is wallets and exchanges are not all segwit ready. Segwit still works seamlessly with the legacy addresses it just has higher fees then segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:08:37
There are no cons. You can still send money to any address you want even legacy. The pros are you save money on transactions and you can use the lightning network when it comes out. The only thing stopping people is that wallets exchanges etc. Haven't implemented it yet. All miners are mining segwit transactions because you can fit more in per block so you don't need to worry about that either.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:54:31
Look on some block explorers for them then you will know for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:16:44

PICKLE RICK *autistic screaming*
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:19:16
That 10% is segwit adoption not lightning. It is not free there will still be fees but very small and there are intermediary channels. I do agree with you that lightning will be great and the future but it's just that the future. The comment I am replying to is about using the lightning network today which is unsafe inconvenient and no one supports it yet. When lightning is officially released I will be all for everyone using it but only when it's officially released.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:44:41
Yesterday I had a 100 s/b transaction confirm in the first block. 150 is reasonable for next block inclusion right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 04:19:36
I'm thinking there is probably quite a bit of old data is what I'm thinking. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:28:47
The difficulty is going to retarget in 16 hours. I would say use 70-100 to confirm before the difficulty brings the mempool back up above 150.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:56:19
This is still in development so it won't be easy or with real Bitcoin. It is still cool to see the tech working which is why people are doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:10:34
Start using segwit addresses. Segwit addresses start with "3" or "bc1". Not all wallets support them yet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:46

@_date: 2017-12-31 17:13:10
Lightning network can go through multiple nodes so you can theoretically only need one channel open to be able to make payments to the entire network.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:46:02
Right now it is at 22242 presses which is 41.43 EUR.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:23
The difficulty is wrong now. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:07:55
Small every day transactions will be handled by lightning where the fees are so small no one will care who has to pay them. Which is good for the consumer and the merchant. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 03:51:50
How fresh is the data? Could there be old data that hasn't gotten update because a node went offline? or are we really just that bad at updating?
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:34:56
There isn't much you can do with it besides send money to and from your own or someone you know's wallet which the same can be done on the testnet. If you want to transfer btc for cheaper you still have to wait until it is adopted by places which could take a long time just look at segwit right now.
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:00:01
It's in main net still not very popular but a few merchants are using it. It's still in development but it is generally safe to use.
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:59:37
Does this work for you? 
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:52:00
Each Antminer unit actually has 3 processors inside called hashboards.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:45:16
Like I said if you are still on the latest block your node is running good. The upload means you are giving data to other people which is also a good sign.
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:49:52
Lightning is instant and nearly feeless.
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:05:05
Eventually I think it will be the main way we use bitcoin. The problem right now is adoption is very slow and it is still in active development. When it is polished and user friendly adoption will sky rocket. Everyday more channels are coming online and more and more merchants are using it. Once it becomes easy enough you don't have to be technically savvy to run a channel it will take off. Right now it is mostly people testing the network and people who are just interested in the technology. It is not yet a way for cheaper transactions because you just don't have many options yet.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:23:51
Thanks your the best.
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:15:50
The first transaction to that address was after the puzzle was posted. It looks like it has been solved.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:33:42
The upload is sending information to other Bitcoin clients the download I believe should be that low because once you download the blockchain you only need the data to keep up the the blockchain which is bellow 144mb a day right now. you should see a little bit of download but if you are still on the latest block everything is good.
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:32:46

@_date: 2017-12-29 01:57:56
The address format will be different but it's still sending to an address. There is the standard transaction fee for opening and closing a channel but the fees on the lightning network will be much lower. It will depend on your usage what fees you will end up paying.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:20:51
I think what's confusing most people is that there are servant years of blockchain data that is identical between the two different coins. It's being called a fork because up until yesterday they were the same coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:16:09
I wouldn't buy small coins but big ones like ether, btc, etc. Then just wait no hardware to mess with or keep track of anything. You can try trading if you want but you can suffer losses. In my opinion based on past trends you will earn more this way than mining.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:25:04
That would be a good solution if you had a couple hundred or maybe even a thousand dollars worth of one or another but some people have millions of dollars. So people will be hedging their bets whether you like it or not but in the end it should yield the same result. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:59:04
If you are trying just for profit it would be better to just buy coins with the money you would have spend on the antminer.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:26:33
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:26:41

Yes. You can only process so many transactions in a block and we are usually at the limit every block. The only way to get more transactions processed is segwit, a block size increase or the lightning network.

That is their trade volume but how many withdraws and deposits, aka bitcoin transactions, are done per day
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:09:16
Yes it would. The more hashrate the more often a block will be found. P2Pool's current round is at 20% which is not out of the ordinary. The past week the average hashrate is ~1PH if you add yours it will quadruple the odds of finding a block. P2Pool is a small pool though and you will have to deal with the randomness of that. When the pool does find a block you will get a big payout but when there isn't a block found you won't get a payout. Slush's pool can payout anytime because they find several blocks a day but P2Pool can only payout when they find a block. It might be more profitable or it might be less on average it will be the same though.
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:47:19
Would it really be that huge? I would guess it is less then a terabyte. It would be a lot for everyone to have but for one person it would be totally reasonable. Most of the transactions eventually get confirmed on the blockchain even if they are spam transactions.

Why would he want to do that? Amazon is a business not a charity. When they need work done they pay people when they don't they fire them.

Why use blockchain?
Because the Lightening network is still blockchain. It is as secure as broadcasting a Bitcoin transaction. It is not an altcoin, you can't cheat one party out of money, etc. Lightening provides the Bitcoin network with enough increased liquidity to conduct everyday transaction like buying coffee, or haircuts. If you don't have lightening Bitcoin will continue to be a store of value like gold which in my opinion is what it is like today. When lightening is fully adopted you will be able to pay with lightening anywhere you can with a credit card but the fees will be almost zero. Today you don't see the fees but 3-5% of every credit card transaction is taken by the banks who process the transaction. I'm not an economist so I don't know how much that will actually effect prices but it will help businesses.

Anything is possible if you hardfork right but it won't be. Segwit or some other upgrade is required for the Lightning network which is a huge upgrade to Bitcoin. If you don't want to ever use segwit then technically you don't have to you can continue to use legacy addresses forever as currently planned.

It is also all the same transaction fee. It is one entity doing this but who knows why.
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:51:54
With segwit transactions for the same fee amount you get higher priority that's because the transactions use less bytes. If you compare using sat/byte then legacy and segwit will have the same priority even though you pay less for segwit.

On the Lightning network you can earn transactions fees by having a node running but I wouldn't do it on the mainnet yet.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:13:05
You could solo mine from your node that would ever so slightly help in that you have the possibility of mining a block how ever slim it might be. Mining with a pool would also help but less so because it's the pool choosing the rules not you. You can of course chose the pool but ultimately it's their decision.

No. It is just sending blocks to other nodes so once the full node is synced it will be using very little cpu time but will be using your network to send blocks. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:34:51
The transaction fee for sending 0.00000001 btc and 1.00000000 btc are the same because they both use the same amount of data. If you send btc to 10 different places it takes more data and there fore more fees. Most transactions are about 200-250 bytes. Right now the recommended transactions fee is 201sat/B which is 0.000402 btc to 0.0005025 btc or $2.50 to $3.00.

Maybe I am in the minority but that doesn't make me wrong. They laid some people off but that doesn't mean they are going to employ less people in the future only that they have too many right now.

Where does it say you can make a change? If you make any changes you need to convince people to switch over. The longest chain only applies with the same rule set.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:00:35
One thing you can do now is move your coins into segwit addresses while the fees are low so that in the future you only need one transaction to open lightning channel. You cannot open a lightning channels with the legacy address format and will need to make a transaction to segwit if you would like to use the lightning network. Make sure you set an approtriate fee you don't need 1000sat/byte but you do need more then 1sat/byte but it's always changing. I would say 5-10sat/byte is pretty safe and will clear most likely in a few hours.

If the onchain delay is unacceptable I think the only solution would be to have two blockchains one on Earth and one on mars and use second layer to transfer coins between if needed. I don't think there would be any time sensitive interplanetary transactions so the delay wouldn't be a problem there and people on Mars get faster open/closing LN channels.

It isn't number of blocks. It is difficulty. As an example Bitcoin Cash has more blocks but a lower accumulated difficulty than Bitcoin Core.

You can set what ever fee you want but with 0 fees miners have no incentive to include your transaction in a block. Transaction fees are based on the size in terms of data not value of btc. Some transactions are more complicated than others and therefore take more space in a block and will cost more if you want them to be included.

No. Bitcoin doesn't absorb any amount of usd or any other fiat. If someone wants to buy Bitcoin there always has to be a seller of Bitcoin on the other side. usd isn't converted into Bitcoin, it is exchanged one for another.

The cost would depend on factors like how much hashrate you have, what ASICs you are using, and how much you are paying for electricity.

Because it seems to be the future and everyone wants to be apart of it as soon as possible. You don't have to put thousands of dollars on lightning you could as many people do put just $5 to test some things out and if you lost $5 it's not a big deal. To some people losing $100 wouldn't be a big deal. It's important you make those decisions for yourself and what you are comfortable with.

I think you're misunderstanding what the market cap means. At the current price of bitcoin to usd all of the bitcoin supply would be worth 150B usd. That 150B usd didn't go anywhere it is just the value of what bitcoin is. No amount if usd has been taken out of circulation. Same goes for 1.5T usd that's what the value is but the amount of usd hasn't changed.

Each time you send any amount of btc to an address it creates a new hash for it. The private key of the wallet is proof you own the coins sent to that wallet. for each transaction you need to include the inputs from individual transactions sent to the address. 
This is what it looks like on the blockchain. At the bottom you need to turn on advanced view.

The hash for a block is dependent on the transactions in the block. Miners put as many transactions as they can in a block. Sometimes there is enough to fill the block sometimes there is not but miners are always mining. As soon as a correct hash is found it is broadcast to the network and the block is put in the blockchain forever with those transactions.

If having the ASIC online makes more then electricity costs then it's online but if btc mined is less then electricity miners will be taken offline.

B2X hasn't changed a rule yet it plans to. Everyone is allowed to change the rules but no one can force others to follow them. Right now I think the majority still backs the Bitcoin Core team. Bitcoin Core has changed but before each change they made sure it was very well supported. Now there is a lot of forks happening that aren't as well supported which is still their right to do but it creates forks instead of upgrades when that happens.

Lightning is the main reason I'm sticking with the core team. If implemented correctly it will allow instantly confirmed and cheap transactions while also saving space on the blockchain.

The problem with other currencies is that they have inflation. Every year the government prints more money which makes the existing money less valuable. With Bitcoin the supply will never go above 21 million. We have inflation due the way the currency is created by mining but it is capped and the rate exponentially decreases. The reason why inflation right now isn't bad for bitcoin is because adoption is way out pacing the inflation.

There are legitimate reasons for creating that many transactions. It's not the best practices but no one is spamming the mempool. The back log gets dealt with quickly and it goes back down to under 1MB. When someone is spamming the mempool it will stay that way for days at high fee levels. Most transactions are still very inexpensive but not 1sat/byte when there is a back log.
