Yeah i am just looking into it his claims about that dont seem to check out... He said that (as I understood it) that the price for electricity in some areas as cheap because in that area electricity isn't used as much

Okay so I will try to get the most important aspects covered.
1. Bitcoin is a Cryptocurrency. It can be used to trade goods like any other Currency and can be converted to other Currencies aswell. It is special because everything works without anybody controlling the Currency (FED for USD for example). You can get involved by just buying bitcoin (converting it from USD to Bitcoin I like coinbase, but choose for yourself just google bitcoin exchange, and look at the ratings. Right now its kinda risky to buy since the value is quite high right now.
2. The Process of how Bitcoin works. If you have time I think one of the best videos is [this one.]( its kinda complex so its hard to explain it in short. Basically when you send Bitcoin to another Person the Transaction (Block) has to be validated and thats what the miners are for. You provide your computing power to help "validate". You can get involved by mining, for bitcoin you have to buy special hardware since the difficulty is quite high, but you can mine ethereum for example with just a normal GPU.
Thats about the 2 ways on the top of my head which I can think of. Hope it helped!
Edit: Formatting
Edit2: And yes in my opinion it is worth it, I think bitcoin will play an important role in the future ...
