Possible, but I don't think they would be investing in the coins that we put in paper wallets and such.  They are most likely buying the funds.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:30:27
They always had 2 sites: Coinbase and Coinbase exchange.  They just changed the name of the exchange to GDAX, but it's still Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:54:11
I filled out the google form but didn't get a response, so I don't know what to do at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:11:23
That sounds quite possible too.  I thought Core had a roadmap in place for HF though?  I thought the plan was voted on and accepted already.  What happened to that agreement?  Actually, I'm so confused at this point.  I thought we already forked at the halving. LOL!  
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:47:09
Never thought of this before, but my latest guess is Neil deGrass Tyson.  Has he been ruled out as a possibility?  He's amazing; could easily be Satoshi.  Maybe in partnership with NASA and CERN - experimentation for the aerospace industry and furtherance of mankind's ability to explore the universe?

the price is still in the triangle as usual.

By this logic, Mt. Gox certainly should have been good enough. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 01:01:12

congratulations! :)
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:18:41
Tons of time involved in keeping up and understanding what new uses and implementations will mean for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:06:00
yep.  If it's not one thing, it's another.  Not saying I'm right, but lately I've really started suspecting govt. and corporate intervention and co-option of Bitcoin devs and early adopters.  Either way, the drama gets really boring after a while.
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:25:16
Evidently not.
@_date: 2016-08-31 14:47:43
not to single out Johnson, but the amount of money wasted on political campaigns is disgusting.  Rather than contributing and supporting the status quo, we should all be pushing for publicly funded elections.
@_date: 2016-08-25 11:55:51
This is the best solution.
@_date: 2016-08-17 05:11:27
Wait until they pump up the price then sell.

I never had those problems with vault withdrawals on Coinbase, but I haven't use their vault for over a year since I switched to a hardware wallet.

Highly doubtful that this username is a hacker (if you want to go by username, that is).
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:23:00
yeah, that taking a break was foremost on my mind this morning.  It gets so crazy in here sometimes I feel myself at risk of making bad Bitcoin decisions.  Even if I feel like I don't know what's going on or what I'm doing sometimes, I definitely want to avoid the poor decisions.  Thanks!  
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:31:21
Try verifying through GDAX, it's easier.
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:03:46
I just think it's a great way to hand off some bitcoins to family, friends, charities, etc.  To give it to them in person rather than sending in a transaction.
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:28:56
I am so totally pissed off at them!  Bitnation or Bitbastion?  In either case; CryptoDawn of Bitbastion was offering invitations to their Slack channel in here, took my personal info on a Google form and has since outright refused to send me an invite to the Slack group.  As far as I'm concerned it's outright discrimination and possibly a phishing/identity theft scam to boot.  They're probably scammers...watch out! 
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:39:00
I always liked Monero. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 22:48:54

Holy crap!  That one lady borrowed 190k to invest in Bitcoin.  That's nuts!  I wonder how many others there are who have borrowed large sums of money to buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:06:38
If it was proven to have been stolen from Bitfinex customers, I would definitely return it. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:11:00
anonymous ownership of Bitcoin is best, it gives us more freedom of choice in the future.  
@_date: 2016-08-01 14:47:07
I think it has mostly to do with "rumors" of an imminent hard fork.  Given the results of the recent Ethereum fork, a lot of people probably sold in advance.
@_date: 2016-08-31 15:09:50
well, yeah, nothing actually matters until Citizens United (and other supporting legislation) is repealed.  But still, there is coercion within the corporations.  Corporations pool/"encourage" donations by their employees.  We need to eliminate the lobby too.

very nice!

You'd think EXCHANGES would have learned their lesson too!!
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:36:11
Mt. Gox was the wake up call.  For this to happen again only means that there will always be a risk of exchanges being hacked.  Why should big investors take bitcoin seriously ever?
@_date: 2016-08-30 21:20:21
They need to handle this on a case by case basis, as in - get a warrant!

@_date: 2016-08-06 13:00:48
I wouldn't consider it, except for maybe a small amount if necessary, until we have serious banking, financial, and economic reform.  The benefits of doing this would have to be massive for me to trust my bitcoin to a bank.
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:11:05
one of the best use cases for Bitcoin, imo.
@_date: 2016-08-22 12:41:14
Social media must be flooded with users promoting this coin.  If I had anyone in my contacts promoting this, I would unfriend/block for sure.  I never keep people on my friends list with a single minded purpose of promoting anything, it just gets way too annoying lol.
@_date: 2016-08-11 21:37:47
that would be nice, but they all charge commission on all trades as far as I know.
@_date: 2016-08-28 18:53:51
so essentially forcing people to use social media?
@_date: 2016-04-02 16:46:35
I think it's great that the BTMs are going into the poorer areas first.  Whether drugs or remittances, hopefully residents are saving some for the future.  I really believe in the power of Bitcoin to lift people out of poverty and give them a seat at the table of the economic mainstream. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:01:18
and then there's always somebody who lives in one of these countries commenting on how it's not true. lol.
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:57:29
I like Andreas Antonopoulos' analogy:  "you can't turn an omelet back into an egg".  Taming Bitcoin with regulation will be very difficult, it's more like regulation (to whatever extent it might be regulated, if at all) will have to evolve around Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-08 17:12:10
I did notice bitcoin trades coming out of Panama this morning.  First time I've seen that lol.

well perhaps only more similar to the untrained ear than others which would be more distinctive like Irish or Indian.  South African and New Zealand would be good possibilities too though.  Australian, South African, or New Zealand.

@_date: 2016-04-15 11:04:12
yes, thanks :)  I am in communication with them, but so far they haven't provided a solution for getting my bitcoin out of the wallet.  Maybe today they will be able to help figure out what the problem might be.  I was just hoping somebody here might have some speedier advice as to how to get it out.  Thanks for responding! :)
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:35:43
halving occurs in Bitcoin once every 4 years.  The amount of newly created coins/miners' block reward is cut in half, so the amount of new bitcoin available will decrease.  
@_date: 2016-04-04 16:25:57

Bitcoin really bringing me down lately:  lack of direction with protocol and price, way too confusing since changes are happening so fast, lack of clarity regarding potential regulations, and Satoshi's a no-show. :(
@_date: 2016-04-10 23:41:16

I personally enjoy saving my bitcoin and using fiat for any bank or tax payments. lol!
@_date: 2016-04-04 14:56:07
hmm, i don't know.  I tend to agree with the hedgies that bitcoin is undervalued in the present moment by at least $250.

@_date: 2016-04-23 12:45:42
exactly how do you plan to stop all of the development, innovation, and billions of dollars of venture capital and investment that have gone into bitcoin thus far?  Perhaps you should be lobbying them to abandon their investments of time, development, and money?  
@_date: 2016-04-30 19:22:57

msm news nothing but lies and propaganda ever since 9/11 (actually, before).  It's legal for them to flat-out lie, so they do so without consequences.  The Clintons front loaded this election with commitments from super delegates.  She's the Wall Street and Deep State darling - no way she won't win.  All of these powerful politicians are above the law.  Very destructive for our society.

Q:  If you were buying from an exchange, and the exchange reporting to the govt., wouldn't her attorneys be able to discover that you had made large purchases of bitcoin?  Or otherwise, wouldn't they press for an explanation as to how missing funds from a bank account were spent?  I think they could compel you through the courts to replace missing fiat from a bank account or divide assets purchased with the money.
@_date: 2016-04-23 17:05:43
well I guess you can pay your ex alimony in Bitcoin then lol :)  yeah, I look forward to getting paid in bitcoin as soon as it's feasible...working on that :)
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:46:20
I agree with this. (critical for Bitcoin).
@_date: 2016-04-22 00:40:31
mostly to do with very positive articles coming out in the mainstream financial press, imo.  Plus the fact that everyone is finally realizing that everything else is falling apart.  While the so called "smart money" pulled out long ago, even regular investors aren't buying the Fed driven rallies in the stock markets anymore lol.  Bitcoin is looking like a better option all the time. Plus the halving, of course.
@_date: 2016-04-30 19:00:19
what are the benefits of this and how is it not effectively like central bank control of money supply?  Seems to me that everyone, including miners, should be able to do whatever they want with their coins.
@_date: 2016-04-05 17:49:17

hi.  as long as we have taxation, it's my belief that everyone should be held to account equally for paying their proportionate share of taxes owed to the country who's public resources made possible the creation of value/wealth in the first place.  
@_date: 2016-04-11 12:54:33
not exactly special since absolutely everything is considered "art" these days.
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:55:47
thought it was just me, but I don't really see how this has anything to do with bitcoin as it stands now anyway.  I don't know, so many changes happening so fast it's hard to keep up!
@_date: 2016-04-23 16:12:06
oh, okay, got it now. lol. sorry for misunderstanding, I really shouldn't comment while not awake yet.  I misunderstood your comment to mean that you thought the whole idea of Bitcoin should be scrapped. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 15:38:43
same reason as why access to the polls is restricted through voter ID laws, etc.  The Republican party would never win an election.
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:34:41
Wall Street blames the Fed, and vice versa.  This doesn't excuse the monstrous greed and immoral behavior of Wall Street or their uber wealthy clients as we see exposed through the "Panama Papers".  All, along with the corrupt government officials they buy are to blame for massive amounts of death and destruction in the global economy and populations world-wide.
@_date: 2016-04-05 17:48:19
love Max and Stacey!  He's a huge supporter of Bitcoin and played a big part in helping me see the light to come to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-23 16:43:16
I wholeheartedly agree that stability and security of the technology must always remain the top priority for Bitcoin, and if that is always observed many things will be possible from there.  I think the main conflict has been a push to get bitcoin ready for primetime and massive adoption for micropayments, etc.  If bitcoin can do it all it will be a miracle, and I think it can.  In fact, I think it might be there already.  The big block/small block conflict and drama we have seen play out on social media has been stressful and a general pain in the ass, but I sincerely believe that everyone wants bitcoin to succeed and if the whole episode has helped strengthen bitcoin for a huge leap forward, we will all say it was worth it in the end.  
Thanks so much to you too for bringing this into further discussion :)

if you don't need the money, hold.  The price for bitcoin is rising pretty steadily lately, and even if it "crashes" it will come back quickly and go even higher.

It's my understanding that fees support incentive for miners as block rewards decrease over time.  Seems to me that as adoption increases, fees would naturally decrease since increased transactions would allow for increasingly lower fees.

Until wallets start supporting all ~700 altcoins, people will keep them on exchanges by necessity (for lack of other options).

@_date: 2016-04-07 23:21:12
I think Coinbase is an exchange now, not a wallet anymore?
@_date: 2016-04-17 13:25:05
well I certainly agree that given how it's all worked out that personal income tax should be eliminated until such time that more fairness between corporate and personal income tax can be achieved.  Personal income taxes should actually be far less (on a percentage basis) than corporate taxes since it's the public that makes the profits possible in the first place.
@_date: 2016-04-16 22:14:35
Something tells me that within the next several months bitcoin will be so famous that making presentations to convince others to accept bitcoin really won't be necessary.

@_date: 2016-04-17 13:11:37
fairness under the law as it exists and accountability for paying a proportionate share (however that is defined) is what i said.   Tax evasion and avoidance are immoral under our current system, imo. 
@_date: 2016-04-16 13:14:58
well since it's the weekend, that scenario doesn't even give us time to get new money onto the exchanges.  The halvening is still several weeks off, hopefully we have a bit more time and maybe a price drop before it starts to price too high.
@_date: 2016-04-04 14:52:10
no, it doesn't.  I just posted because it has been a hot topic in this subreddit regardless.  It is relevant in the sense that billions of dollars in tax evasion has harmed governments and people world-wide, greatly magnifying the global financial crisis which spurred the creation of the Bitcoin experiment.  Plus, the graphic is similar to other animated visualizations of the blockchain I've seen in other posts.  Thought people might want to check it out.

I did a price estimation with some modelling software that came out around 36k, but I thought it would take about 10 years from now to get there.  With all going on, it's anyone's guess where the price will settle after halvening.  But I think the price will continue to rise through the 1st quarter of 2017.  We may see retracement after halvening, another sustained rise later in the year and then another drop in early 2017.  I don't think it will be like the last huge spike though, I don't think it will crash to low levels again. I think the new high price will be supported this time around. Buy and hold (HODL) lol.  Buying a whole bitcoin might be out of reach for most of us in the very near future.  Not that it matters, any savings put into Bitcoin is money well invested.

assuming the seller, since they're engaging in commerce vs. simply buying bitcoin for fiat, would be spending the bitcoin in their home country and thus enhancing their local economy, I don't really see how it would be seen as avoiding capital controls.

well governments do use their currencies as weapons of economic destruction against each other too.  Global debt has risen to such a massive level that it can't be repaid.  Fiat currency and our current system is debt-based and no longer viable.  All of the money for what it's worth has been distributed to the wealthiest people in the world who also have the most political clout.  This is a huge problem.  Governments globally have been corrupted by money and the people are left with basically nothing.  So now, even the large corporations have no customers and tons of debt.  We need a global re-start.  Currently we are in a managed decline as long as nothing goes haywire and sets a spark to geo-political tensions.

I don't know much about bitcoin gambling and I'm not a trader.  I bought bitcoin recently with a good amount of my savings as an alternative way to save money.  The only way I can see to stop the "gambling" would be to take it off the exchanges, but I don't see that happening any time soon having just read about Blockstream's Liquid which will facilitate instantaneous transfer of bitcoin between exchanges allowing traders to take advantage of arbitrage.

Saving is good for people who plan to get old and not be able to work anymore, unless we want our governments to cover all those costs through taxation.  Unfortunately, government (politicians) corruption and corporate greed in our current system has been so massive that the people have been totally robbed of any savings or ability to keep up with inflation, not to mention the fact that the poor of the world have been totally shut out of any possibility of entering the global economy.  This leads to social unrest, etc.  High electricity use from bitcoin mining would be offset by rise in use of renewable energy.

Yes, great post!  You said it already, but everybody needs to drop egos and stop taking sides.  What's good for Bitcoin as a whole needs to take priority over the concept of "winning".  I also agree with   The divisiveness and fighting has become too much, it really needs to stop!

because fiat currency simply doesn't work anymore.  Unless governments go back to the gold standard for backing their currencies, bitcoin is a good alternative for preserving purchasing power.

I think they've always been able to have access with a warrant.  I saw an iPhone opened in about 1/2 second on a news report.  This seems like a slippery slope to me, more like they want access to streaming data on a constant basis rather than the ability to access individual devices on a case by case basis.  Yes, when they have reasonable cause and have a search warrant for the data they should be able to access but otherwise not.  Far too much of our privacy and personal data has been sacrificed already!  
@_date: 2016-03-23 01:56:09
usually you just have to follow instructions for submitting proof of identity and financial info to raise limits on the exchanges.  other than that, it probably is based on your credit availability and score maybe (bank policy) but i haven't heard that mentioned specifically. Also, I've heard of limits being arbitrarily lowered and raised, but I think that has more to do with bank policies (not Coinbase or other exchanges).
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:16:00
First of all, Switzerland signed onto the Bank Secrecy Act along with pretty much every other country a couple of years ago (meaning that Swiss Bank accounts are not secret and they have been providing info on foreign account holders to US govt./IRS for some time.  Ever since UBS was busted for helping wealthy US tax payers avoid taxation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis).  I suspect this comment from Obama is nothing more than to provide and excuse for why the public should have zero access to unbreakable encryption.  Legislation like this where all countries provide bank information, and the bail-in laws have been around for awhile now.  These are not new laws.  All banks from all countries now are required to share information upon request, and if they do not agree they might seriously regret that decision in the future.  Similarly, all banks (and non-banks) have a coordinated plan to prop up systemic failure in the banks that are buckling under massive debt through bail-in laws that will seize customer deposits above a certain threshold and convert to bank stock (or something similar).  In this way, they protect taxpayers from having to foot the bill for bank collapse.

I definitely think more privacy features would be great for Bitcoin!  Not sure why Ethereum didn't opt for this.  Maybe because they are an OS (or platform) and have to provide the ability for govt. agencies to monitor?  But I thought maybe they were working on ring signatures too.

I would rather see Bitcoin have a board of annually elected representatives from its various groups: developers, miners, businesses, investors, and users who could communicate with their various contingencies about challenges and issues facing bitcoin, gather their votes and represent their groups in meetings where major issues will be decided and voted upon.  A representative democracy.  Elected offices could be chosen from within that group of representatives.  Something like that, but definitely something more organized than wild free-for-alls conducted on the internet.

@_date: 2016-03-12 15:14:12
price stability with low inflation or deflation is best, as are commodity-backed currencies, but endless mining of gold and silver to meet demand of currency is unsustainable and terrible for the environment in the short term, and might not even be possible.  A bitcoin solution is best for the people and the planet.

I don't like these AML/KYC requirements, but I did submit the required documents.  I needed higher limits, so I figured I might as well do it with Coinbase.  I've actually had great experience, customer service with them.  Not sure where the LinkedIn social media profile would fit in unless people are requesting higher limits based on salary and employment with a certain company (something a bank statement wouldn't necessarily show).  It's a terrible time we live in with all of these privacy intrusions.  I really hope we can start working toward restored privacy in the near future!

used to think it might be, but lately it seems that other agendas are driving BTC values more than external factors that would normally be expected to impact price.  According to these forcasts, BTC will be down by at least 25% by summer, so no I wouldn't say it's a good hedge at all (gold much better).   Although, head developer of eth says "pump is coming" and is offering a bot that will bring 30% profit, so you might try that.  Just be sure you can get out before the dump though. LOL!

I had a little issue too, so I checked out the paper work included with the wallet.  These hardware wallets are considered "Class-B" electronic devices, and by law (FCC) they must be able to receive incoming messages.  I called customer support immediately when I had the glitch, and haven't had an issue since.  I think maybe they were just testing functionality of the wallet.  I've heard Trezor users have been having issues too. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 18:37:39
okay. so i have plenty of high value transfers out of Coinbase to my hardware wallet.  What 3rd party tool do I use to correct Coinbase's transcript which by default considers these "sales"?  How do i correct the record to protect myself from tax liability for sales that never happened?
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:36:17

I think the better model for charity is for developers to donate time and skill creating games or apps for the charities themselves.  That way, users could be interacting and donating directly to the charity without going through intermediary.  They could also research cost ratios of the charities first and reward the ones that are giving the most directly to the cause vs. those that spend too much on administrative fees while in reality, only like .02 goes to the cause.  Also, their donations could and should be tax deductible and they have the opportunity of being directly involved on a long term basis with their preferred charities. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 03:29:02
well, that corporation/foundation is merged with the government already so they might not have to worry about all that stuff.  But I certainly wouldn't be interested in Bitcoin any longer if it becomes centralized and privatized by a big corporation aligned with the govt. (although quite likely it was created by the government or branch/agency of the govt. in the first place).  I certainly don't hate the government, but I cherish the comparative independence and decentralized nature of Bitcoin.  I agree with them that it's the defining unique characteristic of Bitcoin!  That other crypto will never have to work or struggle for anything they have like Bitcoin had to.  Bitcoin has earned every single bit of it's success and popularity - well earned, hard earned.  Something to think about - I read earlier that if HRC gets elected, she wants all of us to work together with the govt. to fight cyber terrorism.  I suppose that would mean that all nodes, wallets, etc. would have back doors to encryption. lol.

Our financial system is like the Titanic: technologies such as high-frequency trading (HFT) and innovations such as securitization and complex derivatives have enabled major players to construct an enormous, fast-moving financial system that creates the illusion of low risk because the risks are not visible until disaster strikes.

Only saying because I had a really rough customer service experience with them too.  Never got through it, I just decided it wasn't worth the risk after being ignored in the middle of verification, etc.  I think they grew too fast and didn't have a good roadmap for how to handle it all - customer service, etc.

@_date: 2016-03-13 02:38:09
good question!  we might actually soon be entering an age where it's more about global co-operation rather than competition.  We're at the end of growth and economies really can't grow anymore until the less developed countries are allowed to rise a bit so that there people can have a decent standard of living, work, and earn money to invest and consume (of course all of that would be re-defined).  That means more developed nations' economies have to decline.  It's possible that we will see a single global currency, I guess.  Bitcoin would be great since it's decentralized and immune to central bank policy manipulation and has the stabilizing factor of being like a commodity backed currency.  Possible that there will be a lot more war first.  I hope not!  
@_date: 2016-03-12 16:16:45
Bitcoin is the most moral, non-violent way to invest, save, spend, (whatever) that there is on the planet at this moment.  That's why I stick with it, I'm just so sick of all the violence caused by greed, Wall Street banks, and big corporations and their profit models that cause so much war, death, and destruction.  We need a complete overhaul of the global financial system.  Hopefully Bitcoin can play a large part in making that happen.  The current system is completely non-sustainable.

I wouldn't link my receive address for my hard wallet to Coinbase.  Plus, it wouldn't matter anyway since I wipe my device and set new keys after each transaction from hard wallet.  That's the most secure, I think.  You're really not supposed to re-use the same keys/addresses.  Maybe okay if a light wallet that doesn't store much funds.  Not totally sure about that, it's just my habit.

I have tried more than once to explain the cannibalistic nature of Microsoft in a few posts here on Reddit and each time massively downvoted.  I just figured either that people were being paid off by Microsoft or that they want more people to jump in and support Microsoft by buying ether.  I have actually even thought that they made deals with the "Classic" team and Coinbase to bring down Bitcoin. Anyway, like I said...I don't buy ether because I figure I've given enough money to Microsoft during my lifetime. Not to mention that a coin with no limit is basically like fiat.  Why would I pay a premium for what I already have?  Microsoft has copied every original aspect of Bitcoin that they like for their Ethereum project, even a duplicate of BitNation.  I think these concerns are very legitimate, and I wouldn't have anything to do with their crypto currency.  The people buying are big traders hoping to rope more money in so that they can short for big profit. period.  Nothing else makes sense.
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:34:10
Americans have to be shocked into the reality of alternatives.  Otherwise if it's not on FOX news, they will never have a clue. lol!!!  4 btc is still a lot of money, but I think there's a line crossed within the law at 5k that makes it grand larceny or something (not sure but I remember hearing something like that).  Whoever is conducting the social engineering op obviously doesn't want to run afoul of that limit.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:56:55
no.  Classic wants to fork, they should have to take the risk, responsibility, and reward if it's a better version.  What's the problem, miners not coming along?  If it's such a great deal for them, would think they would jump on board immediately.  Users will follow if that's what they want to do after the fork has occurred.  That's as it should be.  Users will vote once the fork is in place.  Besides, how would the vote ever be seen as legitimate?  Easy to sign up tons of fake users and automate voting probably.  Most users are not developers and don't fully understand the possible risks associated with forking.  They shouldn't be put into a position of shouldering responsibility for the fork.   
@_date: 2016-03-28 15:11:13

I think that's a reasonable possibility.  I always thought bitcoin was in some respect a government project.  Possibly a branch of defense or intelligence since I first found it in a 3-D virtual world and lots of those people were running all manner of experiments in those environments.  Anyway, government agencies and private companies and institutions are so enmeshed now, they're basically one and the same.
@_date: 2016-06-24 22:28:23
Bitcoin as a global currency might happen sooner than any of us would imagine.  As I see it, global economic circumstances have become so dire that Bitcoin is not simply an option, it's actually a need. 
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:15:59
yes, when you sell or exchange for any good or service.  The difference between what you bought the bitcoin for and its value when sold or exchanged.  Not income taxes, capital gains taxes. and depending on your tax bracket and  if you itemize will have a lot to do with how much the IRS will scrutinize.  Bitcoin is not an employer, so gains are not subject to income tax.  It is however a potentially appreciating digital asset, and if you realize gains through conversion into fiat or other goods, services, or assets, you have to pay.   You are limited to write off of losses up to 3k at this point, I think.

I gathered the information from reading and listening to articles and interviews with Dr. Craig Wright.  I believe Satoshi Nakamoto is a group of individuals and since he wasn't able to complete the transaction on his own with just his own key, I believe what he says about it being locked in a trust which would require more than one signature is likely true and it would make sense that the purpose of the trust would be for the ongoing benefit of Bitcoin.

I agree, but only if using bitcoin.  Unfortunately the lack of ROI for bitcoin mining has ensured that most bitcoin is purchased on exchanges though, and they all require KYC/AML compliance.  So it's still basically like doing business with banks.

deposit, then sell, then transfer to your Coinbase wallet.  I'm pretty sure Coinbase is a bank or at least they are partnered with BBVA, so your USD balance can be held in your Coinbase wallet safely.  If you want to deposit back to your bank account, you need to link it and they will make the transfer but it does take a few days and there is a fee for the service.  
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:30:27
I did hear this morning on the news that global banks will be easing again.  It's a tough call; gold is good, but I think Bitcoin is better in the long run.  It has a much longer timeline for future growth and more resistant to decline when economic conditions improve.

unclinching my hodl fist in exchange for more participation and voting rights regarding future business expansion,  investment opportunities on the blockchain, and the opportunity to give back 50% of recent profits to blockchain devs.  This halving will be a huge event and just in case the bitcoin price skyrockets, it's easier for me to make the switch to a new crypto now than it will be later.  The moon price of this halving will be amazing, but there's still the future to consider.  I consider the switch a win, win, win situation.  Actually, it's really not a switch even.  I can still always convert back into bitcoin.  Still Hodling lol.

rough translation:  "Cheat ( or fool ) Death Like Bitcoin"  The article is about a mental health institution and the article says something about the fact that there are no more guards in the guardhouse and that the situation is unacceptable to the syndicate of workers (or workers' union) at this psychiatric hospital.

everybody already pays taxes on the money they use to buy their bitcoins.  the banks report and the IRS has records for comparison.  this whole thing is ridiculous and should be challenged.  people are supposed to report whenever they make money or realize capital gains including sales and bartering.  that's the law and it has nothing to do with peoples' personal info in Coinbase.

okay, but i really don't think kids should be too money-focused before the age of maybe 8yrs old.  even then, not too focused on it (it's not healthy).  psychologically speaking, kids don't really understand certain big concepts before that age and it could be damaging.

I really don't know why most people would be so upset by this.  Everybody is supposed to be reporting gains in the event of sales already.
btc/cryptocurrency exchanges are far more intrusive and have much more privacy invading practices than any traditional bank I've ever worked with.  I've set up much larger accounts (online and offline) with traditional banks far easier than the hoops these exchanges make you jump through for proving identity.  They are FAR worse than traditional banks, the IRS, or any Govt. agency I've ever had dealings with in my entire life!! In fact...it's come to the point that you have to hire an attorney to help you get access to your funds in the event of a problem.  That sucks!!

It's one thing for markets to pull back due to uncertainty around election times, but if bitcoin is effected one way or another because of a particular political outcome, I'm selling my coins.  There would no longer be any reason to hold since there will always be a changing of the guard in terms of which party and what candidates are elected.  Not to mention that it would be an irrefutable sign that Bitcoin is controlled by the government.  Might as well dump the coins and just wait for the govt. to replace bank account balances with whatever coin they choose.
@_date: 2016-11-07 13:39:42
sure, why not?
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:30:58
you're right, it can't be regulated by a single party.  But there is something...it's detectable. Several months ago when i used to make large bitcoin transfers, by coincidence there were always state police gathered at the end of my road.  Maybe just a coincidence but there's no reason for police to be here.

that's ridiculous.  Just because i say it isn't bad doesn't mean it's good either.  i am not trying to encourage him one way or the other, he needs to make up his own mind about what to do with his money.  i happen to believe that bitcoin is the best thing anyone can do with their money, but that has more to do with my personal convictions than profit motive.

Sigh.  I would really like to watch this, but I can't get past 3mins.  Ted talks are so boring and done in a bad format for the internet imo.  I realize that the speakers are attempting to "dumb down" complex subjects for the masses, but the slow vocal cadence and tone that they all use in presenting their subjects bores me to death, puts me to sleep, and makes it impossible to watch and maintain interest.  The internet is a fast moving environment...Ted talks just don't fit unless the viewer is over 60 years old, possibly.

i tried not paying taxes for more than a year once because i was so upset with everything going on.  but, when i couldn't postpone payment any longer, paying up was really brutal.  everybody is forced to support this activity.  i have taken it personally over the years about my complicity and responsibility for participating.  it's really painful when you accept it at a very deep level. that's when i started to leave the banking system, it just took me a couple of years longer before i figured out where to go.
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:25:47

You don't owe them an explanation, so just don't say anything.  If they ask, tell them you are sending the money to your on-line investment account and then consider switching banks since it's really none of their business in the first place.
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:18:48

I don't see how.  Why would they come into Reddit when they're getting the comments in Twitter?  People are very attached to their social networks, they won't switch or add a new one easily.  Why make it easier for them to just stay in Twitter?

@_date: 2016-09-28 18:58:17
So sorry, my heart goes out to you.  I've been worrying that I might need to do the same in the near future.  Then again, we're lucky to have any savings at all and that's what it's for when big stuff comes up and the money is needed.  Everything will work out in the long run, I'm sure.  Bitcoin provides so many great opportunities and I'm sure you will be able to re-build your bitcoin reserves down the line. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 17:42:29
most likely it will rise, then fork immediately and come down to where it is now and probably stay where it is for a very long time.
@_date: 2016-09-14 12:19:32
same.  It seems Bitcoin will never be allowed to rise.  If it does go up to $750  we will just be in the same place we were a few months ago.

Gamblers Anonymous if you think you have a problem.
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:59:58
true, but there are a lot of other aspects to Bitcoin like the potential for political and policy activism and reform which is so desperately needed.  Those efforts could be weakened by association with politics such as picking "winners" and "losers" (making a game out of it, so to speak).  It also encourages politicians to insinuate that people would profit by voting for them.  That's unethical, imo.  Bitcoin should keep a healthy distance from all of that.  Otherwise it runs the risk of being corrupted.
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:48:30
I've had the feeling for some time now that rather than apolitical, Bitcoin is actually extremely political and has come into agreements with central banks and governments.  It's apparent that the markets for Bitcoin are being artificially surpressed and held in a holding pattern until everything is coordinated.  That's not what I signed up for when I got involved in Bitcoin, but apparently that's what Bitcoin devs and companies want.  ** just how it seems to me.

If it takes disruption, so be it, but once everything's hit bottom there's really nowhere to go but up.  Leadership from a new generation is welcome, but let's please not mythologize them as new "masters of the universe" or something like that.  We've seen that movie before.

@_date: 2016-09-12 05:13:14
The BEST endorsement is simply to let the price rise.  That's what will catch people's attention.  Other than that, I don't believe a celebrity endorsement or anything like that would have much effect on the price at all. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 17:38:18
fine, but what good does it offer humanity?
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:14:21
one of the most important steps would be to get money out of politics.  Campaign finance reform and the repeal of Citizens United and other supporting legislation would go a long way toward leveling the playing field by not allowing special access and favors to the corporations and the wealthy.  Also, "white collar" crime always gets a pass.  Massive financial crimes are in fact violent and should be treated as such under the law.  The tax code needs to be revised to eliminate loopholes so that corporations and the wealthy are actually paying their fair share.  Decades ago when they paid higher rates (and actually paid) there was much more equality,  opportunity, and social mobility for the people.  There is so much that needs to be done and undone.  Repealing Citizens United is the most important though, since nothing else really matters until that happens. 
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:19:39
I had a problem linking in from a Bitcoin news site.
@_date: 2016-09-15 18:56:16
"most likely" is a speculative reply.  I don't see evidence for predictions requested by OP.  However, I don't see the fork as benefiting the current Bitcoin price at all, only slowing future growth if at all.  If somebody does see how Bitcoin price will rise after the upcoming fork and can explain why that would be, I would be very interested in hearing about it.
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:44:58
Just my opinion, but I really feel this political stuff is totally inappropriate for Bitcoin.  I actually think it's dangerous for Bitcoin (weakens it) to be associated with politics.

**Seems to me.  Lots of political posts supporting US presidential candidates, lots of pro-Wall Street global bank posts (not that the banks shouldn't make use of the technology) but the posts have been outright in praise and defense of the banks.  I find this support of government and global banks very odd, especially combined with inexplicable price movements or the lack of movement at all.  Like I said it's just my own sense of things, no factual evidence.

I think I would prefer graduated, uniform tax rates globally (no loop-holes or tax havens) than a tax-free world.  I'm opposed to privatization of things like water, education, essential services, and national treasures such as our parks and forests.  The mechanism for tax collection seems more or less okay as it is (self-reporting), but the code needs to be re-written and updated.  I don't think we should have separation between corporate and individual taxation.  Everybody should just pay a straight percentage and deductions should be eliminated.

no, I'm saying that the reward should naturally rise commiserate with increased responsibility of securing the blockchain which is and will continue to support more and more vital services for all of humanity.  Incentive for miners is a necessary component, and as scarcity of new coins increases - value of reward should increase.  Also, profits will need to be shared in order to make room for more miners.

GDAX. If you place a limit order there will be no fee attached. I'm not sure how quickly the price of Bitcoin is rising now, but if it is just place your order at a value close to the high end and hopefully it will be filled pretty quickly.

i think there's a bitcoin bank.  You could probably open an account with them and convert to USD there.  Then later, change banks if you want to.  No law against that.  Wire all at once if you're changing banks.  But yes, you will be responsible for taxes on the gains.

Upon reading the article about Sartre on the nobel prize, it occurs to me that Satoshi Nakamoto has perhaps already received the award or is currently being considered.

This message seems to be more about coding or encryption than an apology to me.  It's almost like Wright is speaking in first person as encryption and perhaps commenting on a flaw contained in some early code.  Has anybody checked out any possibilities along these lines?  Is this an encoded or encrypted message in and of itself?  BTW, I do think he is one of a few Satoshis (probably 3, one may be deceased).  Someone else has a piece of the key or multiple approvals are required perhaps?

It occurs to me that as the opportunity of mining new coins decreases with the halving that miners will need to share profits in smaller increments but that as the value of bitcoin rises, mining will always remain profitable.  I think, actually, that halving in and of itself doesn't change much and is "already priced in" so to speak.  But the utility of bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain continue to grow exponentially with endless use cases and applications.  This is what really adds value to bitcoin imo, since mining is the very activity that provides security for it all.  That, coupled with scarcity.  Fewer coins rewarded for the enormous task of securing the entire blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 00:02:14
if you place your limit that low you might never get your order filled.  But yeah, you should be able to place an order for one bitcoin and I'm sure it would be filled almost immediately.  I'm not talking about saving tons of money on the price, just saving on a small fee (but I don't think the fee for a one bitcoin purchase is too high as I recall).  You can only set your price within certain parameters anyway (or at least that's how the old exchange was).  I haven't traded on GDAX yet, but if you can't do it there you can do it simillarly on another exchange.  It's just that if you're already with Coinbase, it shouldn't be too hard to register and sign into GDAX.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:32:10
If he's not Satoshi, he was hired to impersonate for the purpose of promoting bitcoin and creating pre-halvening volatility in bitcoin price.  FUD, which he probably capitalized on himself along with others in on the scheme.  Wright or other colleagues of his are involved in the Whale Club.  I've seen Tulip Trading participation over there.  Also, manipulating the end result of the block size debate would be an obvious potential motive.

I disagree.  It's been proven that those who have had the least are the most generous when given the opportunity to be so.  Those that have the most BTC in the end will also be the ones to give it away most freely. Ultimately, when you have an obscene over-abundance of wealth, your life becomes meaningless.  Generosity becomes the only way to restore meaning and happiness by giving away to others who are in need.  I think Bitcoin will go a loooong way towards alleviating inequality.

The most exciting developments that I see coming are lots of more private ways of using the internet:  Social media, content protection, etc.  If the price never rises, I'm fine with that.  I love Bitcoin as it is and will use it mostly in any application that offers more privacy.  I use Bitcoin for savings since I feel more comfortable holding my own money rather than keeping it in the bank, but I also use it to invest in other upcoming ICO opportunities on the blockchain.  Over some period of time if the price seems to be set at $700.  I would possibly need to sell some of my BTC because I do have some important uses for some of the money coming up.  That is, if I can't figure out a way to pay or possibly borrow with BTC.  I would hate to do that (sell), I hate even thinking about it but I might have to.  Maybe there will be another way....I hope so!

they will start piling in once they see Bitcoin rising dramatically in comparison to their legacy investments and continued geopolitical mayhem.  I think we will see a new Bitcoin ETF launch soon.  That will be a good vehicle for the wealthy to get into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-18 10:49:55
Please.  They've been chasing pedophiles around the internet for 20+ years and apparently it's only made the problem worse.  This issue is nothing more than a huge emotional trigger deployed for the purpose of getting people to voluntarily sacrifice their privacy.  We should not all be labeled as potential criminals just so law enforcement can be automated.  
@_date: 2016-07-21 18:09:26
I wouldn't be so sure about anything going on today.  Maybe, maybe not.  I certainly hope they stop.  The sooner, the better!

I love that he told the media to f*ck off.  Generally speaking, they are a bunch of irresponsible, lying vultures.  More people should follow his example.
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:44:00
I'm worried about that too.  I think maybe something happened during the halving!
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:37:13
this is a cool idea!
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:05:05
I don't think that will be an issue because it really doesn't matter if you hold 1k BTC or ten dollars worth, it still appreciates in the long term at the same percentage rate.  Everybody holding now will be sellers soon enough because there are other things they will need and want to spend their bitcoin on.  Bitcoin is not an answer to inequality in terms of everybody having the same amount of BTC, but rather that what they do have and save retains its value and appreciates in value over the long term as opposed to current policies around global finance and paper fiat currencies.  Also, there is the difference between Bitcoin/bitcoin Protocol/currency.  Bitcoin might not be the universal currency, but some iteration of it likely will be.

Funny and tragic, but it might happen.  I've resigned myself a long time ago to that possibility.
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:08:45
nobody can say for sure, but I feel pretty strongly that it will be priced by at least 3,000 USD by the end of this year.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:18:04
I believe the price will rise significantly, bringing much more media attention and people with purchasing power they want to spend with various businesses.
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:35:48
goal! *gate!
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:19:21
not sure. I'm not in the DNMs myself, but they do have a thread here in Reddit and I've seen a couple of posts to that effect. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:47:00
thanks so much, Darin!

Welcome!  I just completed the survey, thanks for asking for our input. :)
@_date: 2016-07-12 19:20:45
yeah, I noticed that.  Weird.
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:16:55
I think Bitcoin can handle this.
@_date: 2016-05-06 10:44:06
yep. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 04:21:28
not bad - very informative, just not quite up with the latest developments of Bitcoin.

Darin, I have an older KeepKey.  What do I need to do?  Will I need to purchase a new wallet or will my old one upgrade through the app?  Will my old wallet still work?

@_date: 2016-07-27 10:50:15
And what happens if you go in and just buy plain old ETH from them right now?
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:56:01
yes!  I thought Bitcoin was already in Japan. I see it being traded there, but never read about it here.
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:22:55
I already fully verified for higher limits with ID, proof of address, and banking info a long time ago.
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:13:02
At least it's finally rising above that 666 level.  Not that I'm superstitious, but yeah I am a bit. LOL!
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:52:20
Agree that it would apply to a wide range of human activity, but that would depend on an agreed upon definition of "risk" in every circumstance.  In many situations negative consequences arise from activities or behaviors that would not generally or necessarily be considered "risky".
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:55:17
incredible.  that would be amazing!
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:05:01
Excuse me, why are there so many posts and discussions about American presidential candidates (esp. Johnson) here in the Bitcoin subreddit?  I thought Bitcoin was non-political.  The more I see this stuff in the Bitcoin subreddit, the less inclined I am to vote for any candidate who's been a subject of the posts!  I'm sick of it, we get overwhelmed enough by election news out here as it is.  Johnson will not take any action that is not politically expedient for him (just like all the others except Stein maybe).  This is political posturing (Ulbricht is being used as an excuse to make Johnson somehow relevant to Bitcoin), I'm sad to see it going on in the Bitcoin subreddits.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:37:20
It's a rule in the mainstream never to cover anything of critical importance.  It's basically like one giant tabloid lol!  Infotainment with an emphasis on tainment (propagandized).

yay!  I would too if I could. :)
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:27:17
Basing my estimate on prior growth patterns, but also (mostly) on all of the new exciting development of bitcoin and the blockchain.  I actually think it's worth way more.  That was just a very conservative estimate, but if it does go up to 3k that would still be phenomenal! 
@_date: 2016-07-02 12:36:31
not that it's different, but I follow this link showing latest unconfirmed transactions from relay nodes.  Yesterday was the first time I've seen a live node transacting from Puerto Rico.  Probably just coincidence, but interesting nonetheless.  Also, same thing happened with the Panama Papers story.  The very next day after the story broke, I saw for the first time a live node transacting from Panama.  
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:02:11
yeah, I just saw it.  I think it is some sort of a bug.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:38:38
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:13:30
yep! thanks for posting.  This only one example of the heinous/murderous misconduct that has been allowed to go unchecked by our country's govt. over the past 30 years or so.

@_date: 2016-07-20 01:56:02
It's awesome that they've been released!  hmmm...coincidentally both around the same time.  I wonder if this might mean that there's something big in the works for Bitcoin.  Govt's can't keep people in prison for something they themselves are accepting/condoning.
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:24:47
passing the torch around the circle.  Circle of lighters (Lightning network?).
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:30:53
yes, I have had response within stated time frame from their support team.  Sometimes when they're very busy though, they do run behind.  They've been really busy lately with expansions into new markets and the Eth fork. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:34:11
maybe the rocket will just tip over and break into pieces?

generally speaking, I think women are more financially conservative and risk averse than men.  I'm female and made it to Bitcoin on my own mostly because I read so much and was able to finally grasp the finality of the old financial system.  Once I truly understood that, Bitcoin became the only alternative in my view.  That said, I don't know anybody RL besides myself who's crazy enough to put a whole bunch of money onto some little device and hope that the whole thing somehow just doesn't evaporate into thin air.  Most people would see that as very risky, imo.
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:29:23
They weren't quick enough to stop bitcoin, if they ever wanted to in the first place.  Bitcoin is backed by powerful technology more valuable than gold, so even if they went back to regulating issuance of fiat and backing it with precious metals they still could never catch bitcoin.  They're either gonna have to fish or cut bait or just abandon paper fiat altogether.
@_date: 2016-07-31 23:47:29

I have stopped patronizing a local restaurant that operates on Bitcoin payments until the situation improves.  In my opinion, there is no dining experience great enough to justify a 20 minute wait to settle the check.  Waiting for servers to perform transactions and wait for confirmations while at the same time attending to other diners is a total nightmare!
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:32:06
I hope not.  Bitcoin still has a long way to run, and I agree with Tim Draper that the price will continue to rise over the next couple of years and then we will be closing in on the next halving too.
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:44:55
Not sure if this applies to you, but they did say that they would be closing unverified accounts.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:21:51
I think the block reward for 420k was 16+ for whatever reason, so they can sell for price of bitcoin at point of sale times that amount plus a premium for collectible value.  I think most physical coins sell for about $50 over the amount of BTC they contain so maybe they could add $500 to the price if they sell it soon.  Otherwise if they wait until just before the next halving, they might get a $5000. premium.  Something like that...
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:53:00
considering volatility, the price would have to go up into around the 780s or higher before it would comfortably hold in the 700s.  Even then, if volume is not there to support the price, it will tank.
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:40:17
BTFATH! lol!
@_date: 2016-07-21 18:16:46
no need to be rude and insulting.  I just did it myself.  Three results before Coinbase:  cex.io, itbit.com, btc-e  all viable options as far as i know.  Not to mention the other big ones:  Kraken, Circle...there are lots of options out there!
@_date: 2016-07-21 19:16:05
I think Monero's pretty popular in the DNMs.
@_date: 2016-07-29 02:46:03
yeah, I think my wording was a bit over-dramatic.  I hope it doesn't go to zero but if it did I would be okay, would buy up as much as I could to help the price rise again :)

weird.  I just requested and they approved a significant limit increase for both deposit and withdraw.
@_date: 2016-07-30 01:55:28
I don't have a link, but they posted here in Reddit a couple months ago that all unverified accounts would be closed starting at the end of this month.

banking and corporations latched onto the "blockchain" terminology in order to get around some tricky reputation issues with Bitcoin after exchanges were hacked, etc.  "Blockchain" sans Bitcoin has become the latest trendy concept/lingo in the corporate world, but they are interdependent and neither works without the other.  I'm guessing a few understand that, but most don't. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:26:57
Apply for high limits on exchange(s) - Purchase Bitcoin - Transfer to your wallet.  I have not seen these transfers take 3 days to confirm, but maybe since the halving that's happening.

@_date: 2016-07-02 14:58:36
I don't like the KYC/AML requirements on Coinbase or any other exchange since I feel that if I want to buy a bitcoin with my dollar that should be my solely my business.  However, as far as I know, these rules were not created by the exchanges, but rather imposed upon them by govt. requirements.  Other than that, I have only had very positive experience with Coinbase and their customer service except for one time when a wire transfer was delayed.  I could have been more patient, but I just got really worried since it was a large sum transferred. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:55:05
lack of fiscal policy, financialization, fractional-reserve banking, and the nature of fiat currency itself are at the root of the problem.  However, that does not excuse immoral, unethical, or criminal behavior on the part of individuals or institutions.
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:04:50
did Coinbase take over that site? J/K ;) LOL!
