LBC stands for local bitcoins. It's a site where people can buy and sell bitcoins with different payment methods.

What bank was it with? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:30:05
For what I understand the deposit receipt was proof enough for BoA (or for at least this branch). A few days ago I didn't think this was possible either. It happened though and i'm out $4500 because of it.

Harsh words... I based my decision to do this on the advice of a local BoA and the information I could find online. As you can see most people were not aware this was even possible.

I used coinbase as well to get my pre-approval for a mortgage. I had to ask coinbase support to write me a letter though to make it more official looking. It worked at two different small banks.

not according to my lawyer
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:22:35
I will be working on this tomorrow and will report back what happens. I will also try to do a cash reversal on myself to see if it works or not. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:51:56
Everything you said is wrong. I got my money back, BoA told me it was their mistake. They have written policy to specifically not allow cash deposit reversals. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:31:18
I can't talk about the legal stuff at the moment but i'm working with everything that I can.

lol this same thing could have happened if I was selling baseball cards.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:20:39
do you have a link to it?
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:55:06
Do they release statistics on how many people paid with bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:00:27
Ha, it's obviously not common sense. I understand you see it that way though. No where in this post or any of my replies have I blamed BoA. Like I said many times. I'm only posting this to raise awareness. I wouldn't have to do this if it was common sense.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:27:51
That's a good idea, i'll have to look into this more. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:57:16
Thanks, at this point I just want to get this information out there. I would have done things differently if I knew this.

User sends me a copy of the deposit receipt, I login to BoA online, I see the $4500 deposited and ready to be used. That was around 4:30pm on Friday. I didn't check my account again till Monday morning. The $4500 was then not posted any more.


Yes, BoA confirmed that the deposit was made... and then reversed.

@_date: 2014-03-07 06:35:56
I was told the teller's balance for the day came out correct. That would make sense since the cash that was deposited from the scammer went back to the scammer. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:46:35
my name on LBC is catstack, I have been on there for over 11 months with more then 200 trades. I have nothing against LBC. I don't care for BoA but i'm doing business with them since it let people deposit the money the easiest. 
Yeah I know it blew my mind about that user doing that. I really thought this was a banking error. PM me if you want a copy of the receipt. I'll also show you a screenshot of my account. Sorry I don't have more info about this. I have made a big thread on the forums on LBC too.
The only logic I could put to the user doing that is that he found out how to do this scam and would rather have $4500 then a good standing account.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:45:18


This is what BoA said happened. Not as they saw it happen but that it was the only way that they knew of it could happen.
Like I said in my post, that information came from two different reps and a case worker. I wish I had more information this I'm still gathering it my self. I wanted to get the word out about this to help other people selling bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:58:27
Not according to BoA, they told me they saw it as cash in, cash out.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:39:10
Saying "Take this to court" is a whole lot easier then doing it. I'm already working with a lawyer and this isn't looking good. My option so far looks to be finding the person who reversed the transaction and taking them to civil court. 
My bank statement doesn't show the deposit at all. It only showed online when the deposit was made. As soon as BoA gave the money back then poof it's gone from the record. I had to file a missing money claim to even find this out. At first I thought it was a banking error of some sort.
The bank doesn't see this as an authorized withdraw from what I understand. I'm doing more research on this tomorrow and will be digging in deeper.

I don't know beyond that but i'm going to test this out with another branch tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:42:55
updating the post now, with new info.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:47:14
Someone else mentioned that post on LBC but couldn't find it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:27:31
no updates yet, I do work 9-5 as well so i'm trying to get this all worked out while still at my job.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:49:31
updated, it's policy to not reverse the cash deposit.. I got my money back.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:52:45
updated! Got my money back :) thanks for your informative post
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:07:29
Yeah I thought the same thing till people at BoA told me other wise.

Where abouts are you located?
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:27:52
I do have a photo of the deposit receipt.
