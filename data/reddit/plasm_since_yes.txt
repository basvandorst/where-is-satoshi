I have never considered any altcoin before monero, but after spending lots of time lurking and researching the project, I have come to the conclusion that the technology is the by far the best solution to the privacy problem, and the core dev team is extremely competent and thorough, and least in their engineering.  It is entirely possible that it will displace bitcoin as the currency of choice among the libertarian set - it already has for me, I'm just waiting for the software to move out of alpha now.

...now do you see where it says Mt.Gox is the "most_trusted" exchange?  It isn't.  PM the mods and ask them to fix their sidebar.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:30:33
You greatly underestimate the size of the black market.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:07:08
I'll give on the condition that they come up with a new name.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:44:48
Bitfloor is great for US citizens, convenient deposit options, register on their site for more details.  Gox is bad news, stay away from them.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:18:34
Don't get so hung up on the exchange rate.  There's a ton of development going on for those who are paying attention.

You will probably end up with more in absolute BTC terms by just holding, even with just the hashing power expected to come online by the end of the year.  And the higher the price gets, the more likely it is that some millionaire kingpin will pay a manufacturer for an entire farm of ASIC chips and take the wind out of everyone else's sails.  Of course, contributing to the network is a worthy hobby, you could do that with a GPU, just don't plan on quitting your day job.

Bitfloor if you're in the US
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:36:24
It isn't closed but it is guaranteed to freeze up or go offline at the critical moments when you need to place an order.  Right now I would recommend bitfloor to buyers, campbx to sellers.
@_date: 2013-02-18 16:50:54
In the USA, campbx.com allows super easy ACH transfers in and out - I prefer to use them if I have to sell coins for some reason.

i've been excited about alternative currencies since long before bitcoin, but this is the first time one has taken off.  why?  before people use a currency they have to acquire it.  bitcoin's deflationary properties provide an incentive to do so, as soon as possible.  built-in financial rewards for early adopters isn't a bug, it's a crucial feature, the one that made bitcoin the first successful alternative currency out of many, many attempts going back decades. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:52:14
If you're in the US, you can send a personal check to campbx (google it).

Frustration with the poor foresight of Gox has me a bit down. They had almost two years since their last meltdown to set up a professional trading platform. It's depressing that the network effect has locked their incompetence into Satoshi's beautiful system. Hell, some people have forgiven them just for doing an AMA. What makes anyone think this won't happen a third time, and a fourth?
@_date: 2013-07-28 02:17:18
Yep, you can transfer them right away.  USD withdrawals take a bit longer - -8 days for the first ACH withdrawal, 2 days thereafter.  Maybe you're thinking of AML/KYC verification for sums &gt; $1000.  Register an account for more info.
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:49:56
Yeah, don't be a tease OP, share with your Brooklynite brethren.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:42:36
Yes, we're in a dip so it's a great time to invest.  Might go lower before it goes higher, but it will be up in the medium term (months).
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:20:47
There is a whole world outside of charts.  A universe even.  Try exploring it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 23:42:22
The tone here is terrible. Insulting people is a terrible way to evangelize. Let's not turn this into a right vs. left thing - we want everyone to be on board. I'm more culturally identified with progressives and I'm thrilled at the idea of making the dollar obsolete, defunding wars, and then creating decentralized forms of self government. I'm trying to spread the word over here and this sort of mud slinging is making my job harder!

With paypal you'd have to wait 45 days for the chargeback window to expire before receiving your bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:36:08
Circumstances change.  When the next chapter of their life begins, yes, of course anonymous russians will take all of the money and run.  These slow-motion train wrecks happen all the time in the bitcoin world, but it's easy enough for intelligent people to stay out of the way.  The naive and the stupid will never last long in an unregulated economy.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:54:29
You're in the wrong thread.  We're talking about taking business away from gox - nobody stated or implied that all non-gox exchanges are trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:02:53
I don't understand this attitude.  Why would you stay at an exchange that definitely doesn't work now because other exchanges could maybe possibly not work under hypothetical circumstances?  Trading is almost impossible at the most crucial moments at gox, it's so bizarre to see people line up for it.
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:02:24
Try campbx.com, they have a dark pool and they also provide an option for 'fill or kill' orders, which can be used to probe dark pool market depth.

Clever "slogans" create an impression of a gimmicky viral marketing campaign.  I'm with OP on this.  Let's  stick to substance to differentiate Bitcoin from all the shit corporations peddle.  How about appealing to people's intelligence and not treating them like gullible, passive consumers?
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:19:55
Silk Road and the online black market in general.  Any anonymous billing (eg. porn, gambling).  Getting around capital controls (China, Argentina, Iran, etc).
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:15:51
Wow, thank you for being concerned about all of the people who are 'less sophisticated' than you, o great one.  Please.  People are looking for a little dignity, and Bitcoin can be a piece of the puzzle.  Let's communicate with them in a way that reflects that.  And let's show that we're not part of a pyramid scheme by not acting like it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:10:34
They have the feature programmed into their back end but aren't turning it on until liquidity is greater.  Let's start using this exchange so we can take advantage of features that the other exchanges are to lazy to implement!
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:28:59
Yes, they have always sucked and they always will.  Do not give them your business - it's bad for your investment because they will continue to have catastrophic failures like the one on April 10/11 that impact the exchange rate and publicity.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:13:04
Great exchange, the platform seems really secure and well engineered.  If they had better PR and branding they'd be a frontrunner.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:46:29
I've used the ACH option twice, works great.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:00:12
Then you can fuck off.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:43:07
Personal check or money order.  Within a week you'll have your btc.  Much faster than gox btw.
@_date: 2013-07-28 00:12:32
Once your fiat is in your account, it should take no longer than 60 minutes to buy and withdraw btc (unless you want to set a lower bid and wait for sellers to come to you - then it's anyone's guess). 
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:12:04
Fair enough.  Blatant dysfunction vs risk I guess.

You can earn and spend them too.  If you just speculate you're missing the point.
