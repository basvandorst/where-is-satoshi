Thats a great idea! Right now we are not working on it, but we actually thought about providing a browser plugin that would allow online payments at some point.

Personally I am from Austria, NFC capable terminals here are available in every bigger shop. Asia has really good NFC penetration as well. Considering pretty much all of the new terminals support NFC, availability will become a lot better in the next years.

The price to pay comes from the payment terminal and will be directly translated to bitcoin at the current market rate and deducted from the wallet. Right now it is tap-to-pay so there is no confirmation involved.

Thanks for the constructive criticism :). That one has not been edited at all.
We are still heavy into development, as soon as there is more time we will definitely be going back to make some more professional videos.

The reason we need internet is that have to make sure you have enough BTC available in your wallet and notify our server instantly to sell it at the current market rate.

1) yes exactly, you will need an android device with NFC chip
2) the phone has to be online in order to pay
@_date: 2015-07-27 02:48:11
exactly, therefore we are unfortunately not able to support iPhone at the moment.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:16:53
Yes, we tested debitcard terminals and they work as well.
@_date: 2015-07-27 03:03:15
Correct, the amount to pay in local fiat will be exchanged to BTC in current market rate and deducted from your wallet.

We plan to display the current exchange rate used (depends on the exchange we are using), to make it transparent to the user.
