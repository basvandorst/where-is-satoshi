lemme clarity, we could also reduce the hashing power required to mine a block in 10 minutes. since there will be less incentives coming from mining blocks, the overall network could reduce the hashing power until the difficulty drops to a more sustainable level. it is unlikely to happen in the near future but maybe in like 30-40 years and enough security developments, we could come to a point where we need to sustain the bitcoin network with hardwares that increase exponentially in processing power

@_date: 2014-01-29 02:36:39
Lil bit of economics tying to bitcoins. Given that bitcoin supply is sort of fixed and that prices are somewhat stable in the short term, higher circulation of bitcoins (ie more ppl using bitcoins as payment) leads to increased worth. 
Let's say 2 ppl trade apples for oranges. Person A buys 1 orange for 1 BTC, and person B takes that 1 BTC to buy 1 apple. Only 1 BTC is available, yet 2 BTC worth of stuff was traded. Taking this to an extreme, in that same time period for the transactions, u can supercharge it to 1k apple and 1k orange. Suddenly that 1BTC represents 2k worth of BTC.
This might help u somewhat understand how bitcoins get their value in everyday life. (Applicable to any currency really)

Just a heads up. If u want to ask the internet for help like this u gotta stick ur own neck out a bit. If u showed ur credentials right off the bat and not write a post like one of those scam emails ppl might not be as harsh. 
Also considering how the majority of the ppl who own bitcoin (extending to r/bitcoin) do not own more than a couple of bitcoins, let alone 3000+, u prob should start with a lower threshhold . the bitcoin economy is driven by the masses of small players rather than a couple of vc/early adopters

I talked to about 5 businesses in downtown Toronto who did accept or are currently accepting bitcoin. Beside the price volatility, the number 1 issue people said to me is that there is maybe 1 person in 1-2 months who asks about bitcoin. While having virtually 0 transaction fee sounds nice compared to the usually 1.5%-2% for credit cards, it doesn't help if barely anyone shops with it.

I would imagine the Chinese forsaw this coming (since they have their own discussion forums like Reddit and news over there spreads just as fast), and deciding to transfer their funds into altcoins. Even while bitcoin prices keep going up, altcoins don't seem to have gone down in prices compared to bitcoin. Since BTCC still had active withdrawals (correct me if I am wrong), would it not make more sense if people holding bitcoins in Chinese exchanges would have cashed out in BTCC? If we look at the volume on BTCC for BTCCNY chart, there was barely any volume in the entirety of the panic price drop

@_date: 2015-01-04 14:01:08
It probably will be an interesting year due to crappy global economic outlook. The trillions of Fed money has done very little to improve anything except asset prices (aka not real production). If something were to skyrocket consumer prices to, let's say, 500x current prices, even doubling minimum wages wouldn't offer any relief for the people. I think a real recessional shock like that is what is going to propel Bitcoin and the block chain in 2015.

I still think Chinese traders dumping bitcoins into altcoins played a huge factor. Altcoin prices across the board increased in value compared to bitcoins. I think the Chinese traders forsaw this PBOC move and got out of cryptocurrencies the PBOC was likely to take over control of.

No. Please do not confuse Bitcoin's increasing value with deflation. Instead, think how an economy gets its value (loosely into GDP). Bitcoin transactions represent the exchange of goods/services, and if the number of goods/services exchanged for bitcoin increase, the relatively fixed number of bitcoins would rise in value. This is the situation we find ourselves right now; there could come a day where bitcoin takes over all the representation of goods/services in the world, thereby unable to increase value through absorbing traditional payment methods. 
TL:DR - speculation aside, value of bitcoins tied to the exchange of goods/services in the economy

I listen to Austrian economic lectures on YouTube. Essentially, money is suppose to be the "measuring stick" of  wealth creation. It should store value, which people put into, over the long run. Therefore, in a Bitcoin-like economy, the system is entirely backed by the goods and services people produce and trade for in bitcoins. With mainstream adoption, you can take a rough indication of how well an economy is doing through how many bitcoin transactions are made by people.

Are you not able to imagine a world where a Big Mac combo costing +$50? Where monthly household water bills total $1000/month? Where weekly groceries around $2000/family of 3?

The issue I have is not financing his proposals with current prices for goods. It's how Bernie plans to finance his proposals when inflation really hits America when prices start increasing by doubling/tripling/etc.. Imagine if a Big Mac combo costed over $50. How will people live on $15/hr with such costs of living? 
And what happens when the stock/bond market finally crashes? Where will the capital gains come from when asset prices depreciate to their market value? The thing we need to understand is that prices are not fixed for long periods of time, and that we need to be flexible with our planning to adapt for unexpected price increases where we do not expect it. I just don't see Sanders' plan being this flexible considering the unprecedented economic times we find ourselves in today.

[Janet Yellen's testimoney]( seemed pretty clear. "The FOMC's assessment that it can be patient in beginning to normalize policy means that the Committee considers it **unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings**. If economic conditions continue to improve, as the Committee anticipates, the Committee will at some point **begin considering an increase in the target range** for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis."
