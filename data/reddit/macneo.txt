Ok, I finished it. The first section is basically a description of how it works. At the end they say that one of the biggest problems is that most people use bitcoin as an investment instead of everyday "cash" to buy stuff. And then obviously there's the anonymity factor that has brought in illegal stuff (drugs and guns dealers), and makes it vary easy to evade taxes. It ends with the question: "are we really ready to give up our paper money and what matters to most people (cash) to embrace this new kind of economy you can't even physically touch?".

The long wait for me happens with the block index loading stage. I guess that's because the app is less than 37mb but the database is 1,6GB.

I'm giving it a quick read. It's mostly ok, but they must have written it some time ago because they say that 1btc = 14 US dollars.

I can confirm the same bug. I've had it running for 10-15 minutes, but I only have current price and volume.
And keyboard shortcuts don't actually work.

Ok. Who in his right mind would convert all his entire life savings in bitcoins? And most of all: if you crazy enough to do it, BACK THE DAMN THING UP!

I would sell all that hardware, or find other ways to make it profitable (render farms or something).

I think you really need to read the wiki.
