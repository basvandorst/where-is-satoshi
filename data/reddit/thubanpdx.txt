Dogecoin, the gateway crypto :)

Saying that doge isn't based on sound economics is silly, its not a communism however the community has a giving attitude, the coin has similar principles and technology.  It acknowledges one thing that bitcoin doesn't though which is that deflationary currencies don't work well as currencies.  Bitcoin is important, due to the cost of entry of bitcoin its very unfriendly to new users.  Dogecoin has a low cost of entry which has led to alot of dogecoin users also owning btc.  Attempting to kill it would only turn off alot of potential users who would increase the value.
Your proposed attack is also near impossible due to ASIC miners which cannot go onto scrypt mining.  Unless there is someone crazy enough to waste huge amounts of power on gpu mining on btc but I would assume most are smart enough to be on scrypt/scrypt-n.

Coinbase will likely be slow at adding additional currencies, and the first they add after bitcoin will be litecoin since its creator works for them.  
Bitpay however has said the if they add another currency besides Bitcoin it would be Doge since it reaches a different demographic.

Sidechain's are merged mined with litecoin and therefore SHA-256, the reason for nearly all altcoins was to allow  normal people to try mining after ASICs came out.  Sidechains make the cost of entry in to the crypto world to difficult for the average user.  This is where doge succeeded (for now), a very low barrier of entry.  
Sidechains are great but wont end altcoins that are off the btc blockchain.
