What's wrong with BitInstant?
I'm planning on buying a few mBTC for myself soon, and was going to use BitInstant through my Blockchain wallet.  Is there a better way I could be doing this?

The question was about accepting payments, not sending, otherwise I would agree with you.  However, in this case, Bitcoin is much safer than PayPal for the seller.

Some people try to be *realistic*.  Bitcoin is awesome, but it isn't quite that far yet.  Denying that helps nothing and nobody.

Thank *you*!  My first bitcointip!

I don't really worry as much as some do about minute changes in the price, so I use BitInstant as it is most convenient for me.

Good on you for admitting your mistake, this doesn't happen nearly enough.
@_date: 2013-05-29 03:00:24
Actually you forgot part of it - your info is still in the BitInstant sign up form.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:56:11
Yeah, I live near a CVS so I was thinking MoneyGram directly to BTC.  How anonymous is this process?  I know I could always run the BTC through Blockchain.info's laundering system but I would rather not spend the extra money if I don't have to.
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:59:17
Ah, but as I understand it, the Blockchain has a sort of escrow system built in.  Someone else will have to fill in the details, but it seems to me that even now this shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2013-05-29 02:21:59
Someone else already said this but it looks like you have your name, DOB and phone number in that picture - you might want to deal with that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:13:17
Try Bitcoinity.org

This kind of behavior is why people are slow to accept Bitcoin.  Crying conspiracy at every naysayer is not endearing at all.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:12:48
This is so classic.  The price of Bitcoin has fallen just a little bit so everyone goes into a panic, struggling to point the finger of blame at "shills" or some sort of "conspiracy" when the real culprit is these very people panicking and selling.
Somehow, with no evidence listed, this post making wildly spurious claims has made it to the frontpage of the sub.  Show me some hard evidence that these shills exist and are making an actual impact and we can talk.

Stuff like this already exists.  People here have already mentioned BitVegas, the Minecraft casino server, but I haven't seen anyone bring up [SecondLife]( which is exactly what you are talking about (besides using USD to their own currency instead of BTC).
@_date: 2013-06-16 22:35:43
Ah.  Not too exciting.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:24:04
Yeah, this sub is a huge circlejerk, but I love it despite its flaws.  We do need to take breaks every once and a while though.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:46:20
Because *da Gubberment 'snot gud* circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:11:33
How *dare* you suggest that BTC will ever go anywhere but up in this subreddit?
@_date: 2013-06-13 19:25:02
Oh my goodness... I don't think I've ever heard such an accurate and concise summation of BBT.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:07:25
So... If I understand this correctly, the miners are inputting the header into the SHA256 hash function plus a nonce, which they change until the output is lower than the target number.  Can someone confirm/deny this?
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:26:38
 I think this guy is a shill.  Why else would he/she refute incorrigible evidence that the Bitcoin price will rise?
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:55:01
Yup same here, if my Dad or brother hear the word "Bitcoin" I get disgusted looks and sighs, followed by them walking away.  I think I talk about it too much.
