Can we crowdsource this? I'd be willing to put in some coins

What better way to spend some of your coins? Also with a bitcoin logo on the tower, the intention of our community will get noticed!

Thanks for being a innovative service. Have been using you for a 2 years. I'm a bit lazy and you guys make it simple with the iDeal integration. Good stuff

Man this is awesome! It doesnt matter it's an alt, it's about growing awareness of blockchain potential. If you don't support that, what are you doing in r/bitcoin? This is great stuff guys! Think about all the people checking out blockchain technology?!

Someone posted this a while back
Im looking into these kinds of solutions too. Perhaps creating a bundled package with a solid solution (info + app) so that local entrepreneurs are easily introduced to the concept and get up and running in no-time.
Edit: if someone has this for euro, that would make my day

Sure, i'm looking at a hypothetical scenario and the possibilities that would give to gap the bridge between the old and the new.
I would not want to take any of the the shit from the old system (like centralized authority) but we sure could use their integration and accessibility and acceptance with merchants

Im dutch as well (for as this counts for anything) and I have a collegue that could indeed not buy through bitonic.
He called the bank and at that moment he was told that the transaction was denied on ethical grounds. Next day it hit the news and the official report was that it was related to a "technical problem".
Now they have formed a formal statement, stated by a ethical comity saying that for ethical reasons they do not support bitcoins but it is currently not enforced as policy.
Here is the translated link of a newsarticle about a note that was leaked by someone in the bank
Personally I have a account at the Rabobank, and i'm taking my fiat (for as much I still have it in Euro) elsewhere.
I agree that the community should send out a strong signal to the current powersystems that they can either integrate and cooperate or disintegrate

it looks very good, but the overall feeling is a bit paranoid. I mean, sure people in stores might recognize you but are those really considered weak links in the chain of privacy? 
I understand that some people might do bad enough things to need such a security. It sounds a bit directed to such a crowd. 
Either way, it's very informative. Good job

Also good for the bitcoin economy

Intro is pretty true, until he starts rambling about bitcoins :)
