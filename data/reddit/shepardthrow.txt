So it's ok for you to accuse whoever you want as a scammer with no legitimate explanation why? When I ask you to explain how I scammed you, you deflect and call me a "fuck boy". Clearly you were just butthurt that I didn't buy your product, so it makes yourself feel better to call me a scammer. If you can link to me the rule on that says asking a question and not responding is a bannable offense, I will wholeheartedly apologize! :)

Damn, consider me beaten!

So apparently I can get banned for asking someone a question? Interesting. I am reading the rules on and no where does it say "Asking if the product is still available and then not responding". Is it generally impolite? Probably yes. Is it scamming? NO. Is it a bannable offense? Absolutely NOT.
It would be breaking the rules if I left a disrespectful comment on your thread, or faked trying to pay you, but asking you a question is NOT against the rules. I'm sorry you got so butthurt about it.

Wait, so messaging you about a product and then not replying back makes me a SCAMMER? Please, inform me how I scammed you! I would be fascinated to hear your explanation. Also, this thread has nothing to do about "scams" or if my account or real or not, it's about bitcoin

You did not acknowledge a thing I said. Please tell me how asking you a QUESTION, and not responding makes me a scammer.
Can you link me to a rule on or where it says that if I ask a question and do not respond, I can be banned?

Lol, and you deleted your comment calling me a scammer because you know I'm right.
