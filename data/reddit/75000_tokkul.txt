The investing people were doing was with bitcoin.
This was a scam where you gave them bitcoin in the hope they will give you some cryptocurrency at a later date.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:29:18
I don't know why anyone goes for the investment coins. Most end up being scams or not being worth what they put in.
If you really want to get involved in altcoins to attempt to make some money just pick a new coin and mine it. There will be many hits and misses but at least you only wasted time and cost of electricity instead of your Bitcoins.
I made tons of money with Dogecoin and Frozen. I didn't make money from Bells and Ducats which are both extremely similar to the ones I did. The exchange with Ducats isn't up yet so that may change when it is. There is no way to be sure just change often and see what sticks.
If you are wanting to gamble on altcoins don't do it with coins that ask you to invest. You are just throwing your money away.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:46:25
This won't happen.
Dogecoin has a large community willing to donate their coins while the Bitcoin community wants to hoard their coins in case they increase in value.
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:23:53
If Reddit actually did an IPO coin it could be some great fund raising and probably profitable for the investors as well.
I am sure many people would do it just to donate some bitcoin to Reddit.

I didn't see that post two weeks ago. 
is still the official subreddit for oldschool where the employees come to post news and interact with the community.
This type of toxic player is why is where all oldschool posts go when they are actually allowed on They can't stand that people prefer a different version of the game, it doesn't deal with microtransactions, and it is growing faster than RS3.
The Jagex employees that work on oldschool don't post on about the game, they go to @_date: 2015-02-03 16:57:09
Check out It is a different version of the game and memebership pays for both. This one is based off the 2007 game and has community driven updates.
There are a bunch of great updates coming this month and in the works.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:43:54
It is the subreddit for the game this is about.
The game has two versions and the playerbase split between and The membership pays for access to both games.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:42:52
Personally I don't like the updated game with the different combat system and microtransactions.
If you do like that version check out If you are looking for a game with the old combat and no Microtransactions check out Membership gives access to both games. The characters are separate so you could do something like a have a main on RS3 and a pure on oldschool if you wanted.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:38:55
So the plan is to abandon when that carry is needed but in doing so increase speed for calculations which don't need it?
The reduction in gates should increase speed and decrease costs some.
Only taken a couple courses on the subject so may be misunderstanding something through my quick skimming of the article.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:39:27
- main updated game
- game built off the 2007 version with community voted updates
The oldschool game has a 2 week F2P trial BUT is getting permanent F2P in a couple weeks.
If you make and account tomorrow there will be no break in you being able to play F2P. If you make it to day you will be unable to play on the 18th only.

It is only worth it to mine altcoins and trade them for bitcoins right now.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:42:16
And Bitcoins aren't?
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:01:39
You would be better off mining altcoins and when they jump in value trade those for bitcoins on an exchange.
That is if you want to try to earn by mining, best bet is just to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:27:30
How much did you put into the site.
I have ignored bitcoin and altcoins until 1 week ago and I one of the first things I ran across was mutliple people warning to not use that site since the guy was a known scammer.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:19:37
Except that you can still mine altcoins and trade them for bitcoins making a nice profit. Just need to mine when they are new.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:12:46
If you are waiting for a crash you would be better off investing in an alt coin and hoping for a raise in it to trade for BTC.

Not much actually. I mined it like 3 days before it got listed on coinmarketcap than stopped to mine other coins. I even sold most of that a while ago.
It is just people claiming things that are untrue and instead of hoping they check back to see they were called out on their misinformation by replying their inbox tells them that.
Trust me if I was a big holder I would have cashed out a while ago. Once people started calling it a scam it will drop in value even if it isn't because no one bothers to check.

at one point removed all but one post by a newpaper from Israel on the story involving the US giving unfiltered data to Israel.
After it got to they then removed that article and reapproved the guardian article which is who broke the story.
Because of the guardian article being older there was no way for it to reach like the original and in fact never did.
Some claim this was the mods way of containing the story in without alerting most of Reddit to it and also appearing to not censor the story by allowing it on For anyone curious: 
[Here is the story they originally allowed and then removed saying it was already covered after it hit  on [And this is the one they claimed was already covered and then reallowed later after it could no longer reach The admins won't step in during cases like this like when banned RT.com claiming they vote manipulated and spammed. After trying to hurt RT.com's reputation on Reddit and claiming they had sent the data to get them banned across Reddit to the admins a mod admitted it was all a lie because they didn't like the site. The mods did this after Admins made a post in about a studio vote manipulating and being caught which helped give their story some credibility.

It takes a few minutes to have it sent. As someone without money to buy bitcoins even getting that small an amount was awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:22:10
Take the time to read about the coin.
If a coin is very cheap and the idea behind it sounds innovative or useful buy that coin.
Litecoin is already a decent amount per coin, now imagine if you could a $0.01 coin and it raised to litecoins current price.
Is it risky? Yes.
Is the chance of earnings worth it? You decide.

Last time I posted this I broke the "No referral links in submissions" rule so reposting.
I don't see it being disallowed in comments so will post it below, unless they count that is submissions I guess. If that isn't allowed too a mod can just delete it or users can just downvote it into oblivion.

How hard is it to google and see it wasn't premined. Being publicly mined before you personally know about it isn't a premine.
Also not sure why you would worry them about quark. It is going to spike after his show on the 19th so anyone who buys them now can just sell them at that point for much more in BTC than they paid.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:59:06
I mined some about 2 weeks ago so no I don't have a lot. 
Mined plenty of coins since. There is just no sense in pretending that show will raise the price for at least a few days. You don't have to like the coin to see that.
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:56:45
It was mined within 6 months publically, that was the point of the coin to reach maturity fast then only allow a million mined a year following that hoping to stabilize prices.
Mined before you knew of it doesn't mean premined.

I checked the only wallet I still have, $0.20 worth.
I know I had multiple bit coins in a wallet years ago, but that is long gone.
Why didn't I invest a tiny bit all my current money problems would have been solved.

Coinbased app allowed the purchase of Bitcoins through it.
To apple that was over $1000 in in-app purchases that they didn't get a cut out of.
As long as blockchain doesn't put something similar into their app I wouldn't be too worried about it.

Just hurting themselves if they try to hold out since Apple won't allow it unless they get a cut.

@_date: 2013-12-04 20:14:03

They took it off because you could purchase Bitcoins with use through it and they don't allow that since they can't get a cut that way.
Seriously just use google the reason is widely known.

There are a few altcurrencies they can mine.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:52:27
That is the funny thing, this can't even work.
Not sure why someone would think if people running 12+ high end GPUs each all mining on this aren't making alt coins worthless then a few extra from would tip the scale.
Eventually the coin would reach such a high difficulty that the incoming supply would dwindle, the pool would change coins, price would raise, and even if it changed back so few would be mined that it won't hurt the price.
All this does is give cheap altcoins to the people investing in them and results in a loss for the community if they had held onto them instead.
