I almost shit my pants *seeing* a transaction this large.

Honestly, I have to disagree. I was never into cryptocurrencies due to the "Bitcoin experience" I had received previously. It seemed very greedy and to have an "every man for himself" mentality that turned me off to it. I followed Bitcoin through what I read online in news articles and such, and this sub really reinforced that. Fast forward to about 2 months ago. I saw dogecoin mentioned in a couple places online, and the quickly growing community with it's helpfulness really brought me a level of confidence in dealing with it, and it was welcoming. Now, having have used Doge for a couple of months, I've learned not only about Doge, but it helped give me a second chance to reexamine what I thought of Bitcoin and Litecoin, as well. I have some of all three, and am now quite interested in the crypto ecosystem.
tl;dr  It took Dogecoin to make me give Bitcoin a second chance, and I know I'm not the only person singing this tune.

Your mind is made up either way. Agree to disagree, brother.

Yep. You don't pick up 25,000 subscribers per month without picking up a few assholes with it. There are just some bad shibes out there and the actions taken by them are not only despicable by standards, but they are outright shunned by our communities ideals.

It took dogecoin to get me back into the cryptocurrency spectrum after a series of negative responses from various bitcoin forums around the internet. Dogecoin allowed me to take a second look into crypto, and I've been subbed to since. There are plenty of other people who will sing the same tune. 
is a great subreddit, it's full of intelligent discussion and there is no reason that and cannot live peacefully together.

Hey man, that's not good. We're trying to restore the relationship between the DOGE And BTC subreddits, not inflame it.

I've just been kind of denying to myself that this is happening. I agree, though. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:31:15
That's gonna hurt coming out.

It's a good stepping stone, and the amount of doge which one could purchase for 1$ (~1k Doge) really promotes a sense that you're doing something, which in turn, promotes general morale of the sub and morale around doge. It's all about getting people interested in crypto, and the possibility that something they did could make them a little extra cash in the long run. It's what works for some, and what works for others will differ :)

I would like to apologize for those who have too much zeal, and flood the sub. with dogecoin content. I'd like to see both do well, (as Bitcoin currently is, with all the gains over the last couple years and whatnot) and there's no reason for the animosity and resentment that many users carry for bitcoin, and that statement also works for users to They're two different things and a few dickheads or trolls from one sub shouldn't turn people off from the other.

It's despicable to hold that much power and deceive and steal from so many. Bitcoin is valuable, and if they really are going to take off with that magnitude of funds, I have the sad feeling you'll find a few Gox'ers in a ditch somewhere.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:46:50
This is awesome! I've always been a fan and now that they take bitcoin... well, um, it's awesome, let's just say.

Yeah, it's a tasteless move to come flood this sub with dogecoin this and dogecoin that. But it's equally immature to let a few dumbasses from another board ruin your opinion of all of it's users and the board itself. Like I said elsewhere in this thread, you don't get 50k users in 2 months without getting plenty of idiots who will jump on the bandwagon. in itself does not encourage flooding other subs with it, and asks that it's users ask sub mods before attempting to tip/use tipbots in other subreddits. If some people don't listen, they don't listen.

I agree with everything except this. If you're familiar and well versed with Linux, it will run fine on a Mac. I run it on 2 different Macs and both run quite well.

He's addressing the Mt. Gox issues, it seems.

Thanks for the new subreddit!

That's the spirit! Just do what we're all doing and close your eyes and pretend it's someone prettier.
