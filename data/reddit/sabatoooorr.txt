You must be an extremely intelligent individual, wow using ad hominem attacks, whilst brushing aside the issue. It's a terrible law, it also sets a disgusting precedent allowing for it to escalate in the future, e.g placing high fees to visit certain political views. It's really a restriction on free speech and the framers would certainly oppose. This only serves corporate interests, the very thing bitcoin, and cryptos aim to dissolve!

Firstly why do you always reply with "does one" or referencing "one". Stop trying to sound like an intellectual your not you pompous fck. Secondly just withdraw from Coinbase, declare your profit to IRA they will do the rest.
