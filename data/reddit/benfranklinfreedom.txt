I bought my Club O membership with bitcoin!

And apparently, to obtain those negligible convictions, the regulators are willing to crush innovation and progress in the USA.

It's commendable that Lavabit refused to comply, and shut down instead of becoming "complicit in crimes against the American people."^[1]

One of the benefits of Bitcoin is that it allows you to store and transmit money without any third-parties and without any counterparty risk.
Some people voluntarily choose to store their bitcoins with a third-party, thus incurring counter-party risk. The failure of Gox doesn't affect the Bitcoin protocol, and it didn't result in a loss of bitcoins for anybody that didn't choose to store their assets with Gox.
If Joe gives his dollars to Bob for storage and Bob loses or steals the dollars, the situation doesn't represent an inherent flaw in dollars.

If the purchasing power of any currency increases or decreases, consumers and merchants will adjust their price expectations accordingly. For example, the USD has lost approximately 98% of its purchasing power in the last 100 years. Thus, merchants demand more USD for the same product today than they would have, say, twenty years ago.*
Bitcoin is a new technology and a new currency, so volatility is high and people will need to adjust their price expectations frequently.
*In cases where productivity, efficiency, and technology improvements haven't outstripped the monetary and price inflation.

The private key is shown on the screen? That seems dangerous. People could stand in line for the machine wearing Google Glasses or some other tiny camera and capture private keys.

Bitcoin provides solutions that the traditional banking system is unable to supply, such as near-instant transfers of value anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, without any middlemen, and with low transaction fees.
Bitcoin provides an open protocol and platform for future development, creativity, innovations, and applications.
The innovators of this amazing system are the B-team? Bitcoin needs to look, act, and walk like the bankers, even though the legacy banking system wasn't able to create any of these innovations by looking, acting, and walking as they do?

The comment I quoted was made by EFF attorney Nate Cardozo.
Notable companies including Apple, Tumbler^[1], and rsync.net^[2] are starting to use warrant canaries. As I stated, it is not yet known whether such a strategy would be effective, or if the government would successfully force companies to lie against their will.

It was particularly annoying that Lawsky phrased it as a given. Listen to Lawsky's leading question^[1] at 60:40:
"Would you agree that ultimately… that the choice is between getting rid of money laundering **but squelching innovation** that
**we all agree** the first job is to get rid of the money laundering."

If the government forced a company to republish a warrant canary, they would be forcing the company to lie. As mentioned in the linked Computerworld article, the EFF lawyer said "There's no precedent that could compel Apple to lie."
The EFF seems to think warrant canaries are a good idea. Whether they would work in practice is unknown.
I agree that secret courts and secret gag orders should not be tolerated. Canaries are part of the effort not to tolerate them.

Overstock.com has a limited time offer where Club O membership (which gets you free shipping on every order) is only $4.95 for the first year. And of course you can pay in bitcoin!
After that it looks like it's $19.95/year. For comparison, Amazon Prime is $79/year and Amazon doesn't accept bitcoin.

The beliefs of these regulators lead to a slippery slope.

Please have ANXBTC publish a warrant canary, so we have a better chance of knowing if they are ever under a gag order or have funds seized:

I prefer sites that use a weighted average price calculation across multiple exchanges, such as BitcoinAverage.com.

I don't think this is a good idea. I wish Apple would allow Bitcoin apps on their App Store, but Apple should be allowed to make their own decisions about their platform and their products.
If you don't like Apple's stance, then vote with your wallet and vote with your feet. Move to Android, move to Windows Phone, or create your own platform. The free market can take care of it.

If you only sell a small number of items, BitPay's catalog items is probably the simplest solution. BitPay will create a button for each item you sell. You paste that snippet of HTML into your web page. The customer clicks that button, and BitPay will take care of collecting the customer's shipping address and other information.
How many items do you sell? What do you currently use for a shopping cart solution? For more complex websites, both BitPay and Coinbase have plugins for several shopping cart systems.

If Mt. Gox’s cold wallet funds are inaccessible due to government action (for example, a government seized their safe-deposit boxes with cold storage keys or otherwise prohibited their use and then issued a gag order), canaries might have enabled Mt. Gox to communicate the issue.
If a business has already had funds frozen by government action, perhaps they could implement a canary for future seizures by publishing a statement with a date. For example, “We have not had any assets frozen after February 28, 2014.” Then they could remove that statement or update the date after any future seizures.

Point them to warm and fuzzy stories about other businesses that are accepting bitcoins and aren't concerned about Gox. For example, Overstock has done over a million dollars in bitcoin sales in less than 2 months:
Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Overstock, said he wasn't shaken by the Gox events. He also said customers who pay with bitcoins are spending 53% more than others ($230 per order vs $150).

Heh, true, I guess the **B**itcoin-team really is the B-team! Maybe somebody can make B-team stickers or t-shirts. I'd buy one.

Reddit comments are an online good that can be created in exchange for micropayments.  Seriously, the bot is awesome (@_date: 2014-02-28 09:04:23
The exchange should publish a warrant canary:
