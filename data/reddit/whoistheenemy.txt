Thats's how Gox was for a while. Delayed withdrawals, but they eventually went through... until they didn't.  The support was also there dragging their feet with false excuses to buy time, until they fled too.  It's a pattern, rinse and repeat, and the victims' faces may change but they collectively never learn their lesson.  
 I wouldn't be surprised if there are only a dozen or so scammers milking this community over and over with slightly different scams.

Why not accept Bitcoins directly, as it was designed to work?  Development costs consist of copy and pasting your Bitcoin wallet address on your web site and the phone number you can be reached to organize the sale.  I doubt you received THAT many Bitcoin sales where this would be unfeasible.  And if you did, pony up a few bucks and pay someone to design a checkout page for you.

The answer is it's up over 2,000,000%.  But that's pretty much irrelevant and only a demonstration of why it's silly to pick a time frame and quote a percentage (as you did) as an example of why something is a good or bad investment.  Get out of here with that shit.

This is your argument for why Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme?  I'm pretty sure you don't know the definition of a pyramid scheme then, as this is how markets pretty much work.  For someone to make money, someone else must lose money.  


Of course not.  Nothing can!  But 8 decimal places and a fixed quantity leaves plenty of room for growth.

This seems like cruel and unusual punishment.  I am no fan of Ross.  In fact, I think he's a lowlife piece of shit that profited off of people's addictions and what many people falsely believe is a victimless crime.  
But life in prison is no fucking joke.  This is a waste of a bright person.  He will rot in prison until he dies.  There is no correction here.  There is no punitive element that others will take note of and be less likely to follow in his footsteps.  There is only vengeance, retribution, wasted resources, and injustice being dealt out simply because it could.  This is not justice being served, but an abuse of power and an activist judge seeking to make a name for herself.  20 years would have sent the same message.  I hope he appeals and wins.

The worst part about this scam is that people don't really notice, and I mean REALLY FEEL IT, until they are elderly.  If you look at the section of the graph that corresponds to your age, it's probably a tiny slide.  Sucks if you were born in the 30s or 40s though.  
Sure, you can tell stories at Thanksgiving dinner about how you used to buy gas for a nickel a gallon, or how you could make a living pumping gas for 50 cents a day.  Most people just laugh at you and dismiss you as the senile guy though.  
I don't think a lot people really understand what's going on until they see charts like this.  And even then, most don't care enough to do something about it.

You should really do more research on what constitutes an alt coin.  Bitcoin has been through hard forks before, and what emerged was never referred to as an alt coin, so it is suspect that a vocal few are doing that now in order to spin things to support their cause.  
Also, I don't really understand why you would sell your coins because of this.  In the event of a fork, all your coins that you controlled before the fork would still remain yours to spend until the dust settles and you decide to spend them.  At that point, you would have to choose a chain.  But that decision process will likely happen very quickly as the winner would not take very long to emerge.  Nobody wants to waste resources mining or spending coins that would potentially go to waste, so I am fairly certain the winning chain would emerge in a few hours or days.  
If you are selling in anticipation of a short term price drop, well that is completely unrelated to this discussion because we go through those all the time.  
@_date: 2015-08-02 06:12:28

All of you are right.  This is idiocy.  But it's also what the "possession of the private key = ownership" crowd regurgitates all the time.  They reason that as long as you control the private key, you OWN the bitcoins.  It's bullshit, and it's like they have no concept of the difference between possession and ownership.  Do they honestly think that Wells Fargo owns the money and valuables they transport in their armored cars?  No, it's called bailment.  Google it.
But if you truly believe that possession = ownership, you just got a ruling in your favor here.  And if you believe that AND had coins in Gox, you just got what you deserve.

I am having deja vu right now.  Anyone remember when people were asking this same question about Gox a few years ago? 
Answers varied, but it came down to Gox being insolvent and you had to buy BTC in order to get it out of Gox, which drove up the price.  That is, until they stopped processing withdrawals entirely.  
I hope that's not happening again, but I am a part timer now and haven't been keeping up with all the exchanges.

You can add whatever rule you like to your altcoin.  Nobody will be using it shortly.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:09:05
Here's my take.  Those arguing that Bitcoin core is the better alternative will argue that running XT makes Bitcoin more susceptible to centralization because it makes nodes more expensive to run, and therefore less likely to be run by regular joes and more likely to be run by big corporations.  So how do you vote?  Run a damn XT node.    
Yes, the miners technically make the final call, but you can show your support for XT by running a node which, if enough of us do, flies in the face of the arguments anti-XTers are relying on and also makes it more likely that miners will adopt it down the line.  
Those telling you that you can't vote just want to make it less likely that you'll support XT, which you can do RIGHT NOW.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:12:01


1) Even if you truly believe this, which you don't, there have been several historical altcoin threads screenshotted in the last 24 hours that were never deleted (e.g. Paycoin fiasco).  2) The mods are selectively deleting posts that don't advance their interests.

What they really mean to say is, if you don't control your private keys, you can be easily fucked by whomever does.  
And I think we can all agree with that simple statement.

I still don't know how long you've been following bitcoin, but if it's only been for the last year or so, you may be comfortable with small swings.  You may even see a few bumps that look like highs and lows, but while they are occurring, they feel like the sky is falling or you are being swept up in a tidal wave.  
I have been through three bubbles.  Every time they happen, everyone, including myself, always thinks they have a good idea of what's happening.  Every valley, there is a buttcoiner or some critic saying "I told you so.  It was going to pop eventually."  And every peak, there is a bitcoiner posting on bragging about how they were told to sell their funbucks a long time ago and they were glad they didn't.  Then, punctuated here and there, are people who try so desperately to figure out why this is happening.  They scream price manipulation.  They talk about pyramid schemes.  They get angry that they can't control what is happening.  I am not saying you fit in that tidy box, but you remind me of those that do that kind of thing.  
There is good reason for this, so I don't blame you.  Almost every bubble and burst at some point has been blamed on the exchanges, Gox most notably.  But now, the exchanges seem to be functioning just fine, and there are far more of them so manipulation is much harder to accomplish successfully.  There was a time when I had to wait an hour for one of my trades on Gox to go through, price fluctuating within a range of 30% or so the entire time.  What we are seeing right now is nothing, IMO.  This is acceptable volatility in the world of Bitcoin.  Wake me up when we see a new high or low.  Sorry for the rant/stream of consciousness.

Are they reputable?  "America's largest" doesn't necessarily mean that.  Who has firsthand experience?

So if those other manufactured substances become legal, why wouldn't the evil pharmaceutical companies start manufacturing those as well to increase their profits?  I am not following your logic.

Do not confuse dismissal of a crazy person's rant as trolling.  Scams abound, people are losing money left and right, and in the past 3 years since I've bought my first Bitcoin, little has changed.  Exchanges are still getting hacked and stealing people's money.  Regulation can change that.  You are blind if you disagree.  But yeah, I'm the troll because I disagree with you.  Dumbass.
Edit:  **//reads a little further.  sees that in a previous rant, you wrote that food safety regulations are unnecessary.  Concludes you are a moron and laughs you out of the room.**

You're trying too hard. The subtle pump is more believable and effective.

It also explains why martingale gamblers fail so hard.  People think strings of 20 or more losses with a 1% edge *must* mean the fix is in.

I see, so calling someone crazy is troll behavior but calling someone a commie sociopath is not.  No doubletalkin' jive there!  
Your rantings are irrational and smell of a 12 year old anarchist, but I do still believe in defending my good name when challenged.  Carry on regurgitating loony phrases that this subreddit eats up instead of logical arguments.  I'm amazed you didn't squeeze in a "sheeple" in there somewhere.  Please do so I can laugh at you some more.

I just like saying "ver-ified." I think you are overanalyzing a bit, as I am not politically motivated by anything. I think that video is a hilarious timestamp, sign of the times, and that's it.

I am not sure I follow you.  You said control is the same as ownership.  It isn't, for a variety of reasons I am not willing to go into because they are irrelevant to this thread and level of discussion.  You also said "There's no need for the concept of law."  Tell that to everyone who lost their bitcoins to Gox and countless other heists and hacks and are depending on principles of property law to recover them.  You may disagree with the law, but that does not mean it doesn't apply.
Property law is not some warped government creation.  It is law that we've been following for hundreds of years, with enough of a solid framework that Bitcoin's innovations (while impressive and groundbreaking) do not circumvent it.  
Edit:  this is the lightest reading I could find with some background info on the topic if you're interested in learning more, but if you google ownership vs. bailment vs. possession I am sure you can find some scholarly treatises or case law if you want to dive further in.  This post happens to be about gun laws but the first few paragraphs are really the fundamentals which apply to all property.

I have capital one and etrade and have never had a problem.  And I have not been selling trivial amounts of BTC using coinbase either.  I wonder what triggers the flag.
