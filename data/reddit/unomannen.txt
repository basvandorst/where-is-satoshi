Cost averaging since 10k, placing my orders every time we go down another 1k USD. Got some today at 6k USD, guess we will drop below that too but I'm happy I got my entry with a 50% discount from last ATH cause I feel BTC will hit higher ATH's in the future.
Might be soon, might be later, but we will be there someday so just HODL and be happy!

Won't happen Mr redditor for five days ��

This is the best advice. Find your entry level and if it goes down below average down. I started d looking when it was at 19k, invested half at 10k and then averaged down during the dip. But do NOT invest money you can't afford to loose, it's not worth it.

Ever wondered why the Swedish government had to save Swedbank (one of the biggest Swedish banks) during the "financial crisis"... Oh, it was because they didn't have enough economic stability to stay alive.
In Sweden you can have about 1 million SEK in a bank account and if the bank goes bankrupt the government will reimburse you.
What that means is pretty much if the banks fuck up (which they do according to history) Swedish tax payers will save the banks asses and up to a fixed amount of one million SEK they will save your own ass too.
Conclusion: Swedish tax payers are getting gangbanged from behind by Swedish banks. Because the bank insurance banks tell you about, are legalized by the Swedish government which are funded from tax payers...
DOH -like Homer would have said ��
My two cents/öre...

Be prepared to wait for returns, otherwise you'll end up as one of the cowards selling straight away when your numbers are red... Hodl

This quite slow and steady climb is so pleasant to watch ����
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:06:50
That's exactly what makes me want to sell. That shit makes me uncomfortable, I feel better when they write about BTC going down lol ...
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:59:23
I have a target in mind when I will sell 50% of my BTC, and another target for when I will sell 25% of my BTC, and the remaining 25% is something I wanna keep just to see wtf will happen to this awesome thing in the future.
I truly believe that my first target is achievable, my second aswell, therefore I don't even get worried during dips. As long as it's under my target it's a opportunity to buy more.
If BTC hits zero, I'll be fine, I've invested a fair amount but not enough to turn my life upside down. And if that would happen, it was fun to be a part of this anyways. It's just money!
