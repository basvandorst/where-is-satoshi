@_date: 2014-10-17 17:14:29
sure just tell me how the fuck i'm suppose to do that. gtfo troll.
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:13:05
no. account was legit and so were my verification docs.

first email:
We regret to inform you that your verification request has been denied.
Account Termination Notice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After careful consideration, Bitstamp decided to terminate Your access to Your Account in accordance with our Terms of Use. Your account will be terminated from the date of this notice having been received by you. This notice shall be treated as having been served upon completion of the transmission of this email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decision to terminate your Account has been reached following a close examination of your information which you have provided. It is our view that any continuation of our relationship would not be appropriate at this time due to internal policies.
second email: 
Your account has been terminated due to internal policies as already stated
in our Account Termination Notice. Unfortunately, we do not consider that
having you as a customer would be appropriate at this time as we are unable
to provide you with full services due to our internal policies. As a
result, we have also terminated the second account which you have
registered and attempted to verify recently.
third email:
thank you for your email. Your account has been terminated due to our
internal policies. 
We could ask our compliance department to reevaluate your case, however in
order to do that we would first require that you answer two questions:
- Do you have a criminal record?
- Were you ever involved in any criminal proceedings against you?
In addition we would require a form of documentation which could confirm
that you do not have a criminal record.
this is everything they've said word for word and everything else i've said is true as well. i wired money to them once about a year ago. then bought btc and transferred most of them to a different exchange. 
so how could i have possibly violated any policies? i do have a record yes. nothing too serious though. nothing to do with money laundering or anything like that. but no wear does it say if you have a record your not allowed to use their site and any money you may have will be seized.
so my advice would be to not keep any money in bitstamp if you have any kind of record i guess because it will be stolen from you. 
bitstamp sucks! if you do a little research you'll see similar things have happened to many other people too!

lol lying about what.... you somehow know my account username and asked if my account was fake and they told you yes? umm ok. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:02:21
lol... give me a brake not separating the paragraphs is the only grammar error i've made. my writing isn't half as bad as the rest of the US. damn grammar Nazi's. every time someone does that on here there's a dozen people who want to comment on it. nobody's forcing you to read it. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:45:26
sounds pretty cool. do you know how the interest works? they don't really give any info on their site, unless you sign up i'm guessing. 
i hate how all exchanges do that, they should give the same info prior so ppl know if they even want to make an account. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:07:21
i did verify my account. i got a second reply from them today and they said they won't be giving back the bitcoin. and still won't give any reason for doing all this. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 00:27:05
here is another reply i got from them today after i asked why they need to know if i have a criminal record. and there last paragraph is a lie, no where in there terms and conditions does it say customers with criminal records aren't allowed to use their services.
forth email:
"By registering with us, you agree to provide Bitstamp with current,
accurate, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the
registration process, and to keep such information updated."
If you, for example, have a criminal record, we are be obliged by our AML /
KYC policies to know about such facts.
"You also agree that Bitstamp may, by giving notice, in its sole discretion
terminate your access to the Site and to your Account, including without
limitation, our right to: limit, suspend or terminate the service and
Members' Accounts, prohibit access to the Site and its content, services
and tools, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal
steps to keep Members off the Site* if we think that they are creating
problems or possible legal liabilities*, infringing the intellectual
property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter
or spirit of these Terms."
The fact that our customers are or have been involved in criminal or
similar activities is not in accordance with our Terms of Use as well as
our internal policies.

it wouldn't be worth the time and effort and not to mention the money it would cost, even if i won i'd probably be loosing more money in the end. 
since there in Slovenia though would that even be possible? 
@_date: 2014-10-19 00:30:49
if they don't want people with records using their site maybe they should make that more clear in their terms of use. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:32:26
i've posted exactly how everything has gone down. if some ppl choose not to believe it, then fine, that's understandable i suppose. i did NOTHING. at all. i haven't even used their services in several months. and have hardly used their services period. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:33:31
i got anther email from them today. they said they could have their compliance department reevaluate my case. but first i would need to answer two questions, if i have a criminal record or if i've ever had criminal proceedings against me. and i would also be required to provide documentation proving i do not have a criminal record. 
what kind of document is there that states if you have a record or not? and since when is it part of their policy not to allow people with criminal records to use their services? 
@_date: 2014-10-18 08:49:27
really your going to comment on that. lol. look at all the other posters on this site. and on this thread. and i bet half the ppl using capital letters are only doing so cause there on a device that does it automatically. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 16:15:35
i didn't do anything to break there terms of service what so ever. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:02:27
faaack youuu. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 08:29:37
umm.. no. all i was saying is i feel bad for the 10s of thousands of dollars + stolen from the people, especially the people who did have fake accounts and have basically 0 chance of getting their money back. i at least still have a somewhat possible chance. 
i've seen reports of somewhat similar cases all over the place, do some research.
my exact words.. it sucks that they stole what i'm sure is 10's of thousands of dollars + from their customers like this. i bet a lot of ppl had fake accounts.
these is two complete different sentences. 
have you read the 4 emails they sent to me that i've been posting? because it seems there starting to give somewhat of a reason. which i still don't quite understand. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:01:05
if i knew it was possible that they would terminate my account and steel my money i never would have used them. those aren't the terms of service i agreed to, their breaking their own rules. 
people don't really don't have a choice but to trust someone if you want to buy bitcoin, all you can do is research as much as possible to see if they seem like a good company/person to deal with. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:04:40
I think they probably did it because they've been getting too many messages. I've been having problems with there site. hopefully they will allow customers to contact them again soon. never seen them do this before. i'm trying to add a credit card to enable instant purchases. but when you click on the link to start the verification the links appears to be broken. please fix this coinbase!
