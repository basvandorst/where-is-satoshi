I don't really care about my investment in it, I'm just frustrated by their sole focus on the price whilst hardly understanding the technology. If you understand the technology, I think less people would be selling. 
I get that they're free to do what they want, but the arrogance is just frustrating.

There's a difference between positive and negative attention though, and the recent crash was most certainly negative. It has a lot of people confirming their biases about bitcoin.
I'm not trying to make a "quick" buck by holding. I believe and use bitcoin because it's a better medium of exchange than any fiat currency. I don't keep dollars anymore so I am technically always holding, so you can't really blame me for that.
I spend when I can in bitcoin, and when I can't, I sell it for dollars and then buy whatever I need with fiat. I think you're confusing holding with hoarding.

Bitcoin is a GOOD thing, it's not our fault that people stop short at the price to determine if something is good or not.

Good advice.

Spot on. We do see through different lenses, which is why I will no longer promote it to my friends/family.

What's your point, man? You can be older and go back to school, but you're right, I am young and I've been a libertarian for what I consider to be a long time.

Sorry, this was badly phrased and I realize that now. I was just trying to say that I don't get how people invest in something and then hardly understand it. 
I don't mean to say that it was a holdings game for me, even though that's largely what I do, but for me it's also about the technology behind it.

Agree completely. Thanks.

Why do you say it's dumb to hold, but smarter to guess and trade at different points? I mean, you really have no way of knowing how it performs in the short-term, but you do have some sense for how it will perform long-term.

My sentiments exactly!

I thought the 80/20 rule was that 80% of your sales/profits come from 20% of your customers.

I consider a few years to a be long time...

This is exactly what I was trying to express. As bitcoin grows, I'm guessing less people will care about the tech and more about the money. And I'm worried that if the money isn't there for them, they will never care. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:57:14
You're missing the point.. I want it to see mass adoption, I just wish people would take a minute to consider how truly revolutionary the technology is and will be.

Great video!

I used to love this subreddit when I first joined and everyone was a believer. Now I feel like a lot of people here are just trolls who equally don't believe in the technology and just care about price movements. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:18:06
Interesting. 
I actually spoke with one of my friends who I explained it to and he bought $100 bucks worth of bitcoin the same day when the price was around $1000. He understood exactly what it meant from the moment I explained it. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:09:13
That's awesome, great story!

If 2008 was caused solely by derivatives, why don't they just ban it?
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:52:09
Yep, this.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:53:04
That's fine and all, until you start saying you know Apple iPads better than Apple.

Thanks, Gavin! I really want to meet you one day! By the way, when's that AMA coming?
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:02:30
Yeah, I always spend and replenish.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:12:33
Also good advice! I never liked the idea of "selling" bitcoins either, I just thought I was helping people out. Side note: I find cab drivers to be really receptive in taking bitcoins in the future.
