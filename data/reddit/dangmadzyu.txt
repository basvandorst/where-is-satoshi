Then how do we know that he has any at all? I assumed it was evident on the blockchain or some such thing.

Human nature, or your nature?
You can't conceive of a human with enough intelligence to not need to spend such an investment until it matured to its full potential?
How many more coins are left to be mined?

Interesting reality you've created for yourself.
In the reality I live in, the majority of people have very little. Almost nothing. This would indicate a population that doesn't put much value in the collecting of resources.
But that's my reality. In my reality it seems like everyone's true nature is to give everything away frivolously assuming that they live in a world of abundance. Which they do. 
But that's interesting that you've chosen a different perspective.

Correct. This is the reality that I have consciously chosen to live in.
You are welcome to join us.

What is the evidence to support this?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:28:37
You will get as much as your karma demands.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:27:17
Do you have the exact number?

Exactly. And if he wasn't, he was surely smart enough to become so.
He has already saved the world, I'm just wondering about how far he is willing to take it.
Ultimately, I would like to try to influence the situation Magickally or Metaphysically. I would like to eventually round up a group of people to meditate on the idea of sending him a telepathic message to save the world with the coins, or praying for it, or other forms of creative visualizations.
Magickally, we could perform group rituals to try and influence our reality.

Rome, Babylon, USA. You can call it whatever you want.
Look into the idea that the Roman Empire never fell, only changed names.
Remember too that the Nazis won WWII. They just changed their name to USA and essentially merged their power/muscle/technology.

It's going to be so exciting, I know.

Let's hope not, friend.

I'm guessing that you believe this means "The simplest answer", but that's not what it means. It means the solution with the least assumtions.
The solution with the least assumptions is that someone intelligent enough to invent BTC doesn't need the money, and is smart enough to know the real final value and knows not to sell early.

You can choose to live in that reality if you want. But I'm not going to. If you need help, try /r/DimensionalJumping
