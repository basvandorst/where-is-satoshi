The hilarious part is you spit this quote in reference to the greatest control system ever devised.  Bitcoin, the most traceable currency ever created, is an Orwellian nightmare.  It is not a release from the matrix, but a strengthening of the chains already in place.  What better way to promote self inflicted imprisonment than through Get Rich Quick via the World Religion of Money.

Extremely small volume in US dollar terms.

I still don't understand how anybody thought a bank for a bankless technology made any sense 
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:39:44
Buy gold
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:56:52
The get-rich-quick scheme isn't getting people rich.
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:17:16
So is sex
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:51:39
Or mail some gold.
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:31:26
Should've bought gold
@_date: 2015-06-07 02:36:53
Oh hell yeah, now this is the kinda life worth living

I doubt the US Government cares about the block-size, everything will be done off-chain eventually anyway, just as they intended.
@_date: 2015-06-16 00:00:20
Bitcoin will be backed by gold within a decade?

Privacy controls can't make subverting tyrannical regulation legal.
@_date: 2015-06-29 02:02:46
Then buy gold
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:33:36
The Dollar.  It's recursive.  It's bogus, but more than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:16:45
Not a new record by a long shot.
$5 forever
Difference is, short selling wasn't available back then.  And Willy Bots weren't in play.  Lots more pressure to the downside than last time.
Will be interesting to see if price collapses after the block reward decrease like what happened with Dogecoin.

This is the last bubble.  The Fed will keep of going for as long as possible.

If the NSA wrote the code, as I envision to help bring about a New World Order, the army is already there.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:36:07
Bitcoin is still backed by nothing at the end of the day.  Even the Dollar is backed by military and imprisonment if taxes aren't paid in it.
@_date: 2015-05-18 02:50:52
That's what a $5 wrench is for
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:47:18
except for the whole part about it being the NSA's wet dream, a cashless society where every transaction can be traced and accounted for, laws making green addresses becoming the standard all over the world, and 10% of the money supply being owned by a shadow figure
@_date: 2015-05-06 02:10:51
Yet it becomes more centralized by the day
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:24:21


This will be made illegal, quite easily.


Merchants would only be allowed payments from green addresses.


Anything is better than the current system.

Bitcoin is nothing like gold.  New copycat gold-like physical objects cannot be brought into existence, unlike the thousands of Bitcoin-like alt-coins brought into existence every year.  None of these coins/alt-coins is inherently more or less valuable than any other fiat currency in existence.
And then there's the whole issue of Bitcoin being the most traceable currency to ever exist, the establishment's wet dream, wholly dependent on the fragile structure of the Internet to function even at the most minimal of levels.
Get-rich-quick clouds rational thought.
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:44:58
These are not alts, each contains distinct characteristics.  No more can be made, that's it.  Less than 200 metals possible, that's it.  No more elements can be made.

Portugal has figured it out, waiting for the rest of the world to learn.
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:15:18
That's the point.  There's no such thing as intellectual property, because to be intellectual, it cannot be owned, for it can be copied into infinity.

Once Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs take over mining, followed by IRS green address laws, not very.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:08:54


Yes, the IRS mandated green fork
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:49:03
TPTB want an Orwellian world.  May as well get in early to have some cash in the new prison/slave system.  When the price beings to rise again, everyone will enslave themselves through their own greed.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:00:56
In that case, BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:30:40


Until bank of america, Goldman Sachs, and Citi start running nodes/miners
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:37:57
they've been trashing it for years, this type commentary is nothing new
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:53:28
Not using the green fork is illegal
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:36:22
You also get cops at your door for using stolen credit cards FREE for a limited time only if you act now!
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:33:07
Sidechains don't exist, imbecile
@_date: 2015-04-16 02:16:52
the dollar was backed by gold before 1971, it wasn't *fiat* back then
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:40:04


Common end users aren't responsible for the losses, therefore they don't care.
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:16:07


a military, taxes, and threat of moving citizens into an iron cage if they don't pay those taxes in said *fiat*
the network of users of the *fiat* USD is forced, therefore the USD is backed by  threat of imprisonment and the largest military in recorded history
