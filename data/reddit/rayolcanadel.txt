For Fiat to Crypto use: Gemini for US based customers, Bitstamp for Europeans.
For Crypto to Crypto use: BINANCE, superior to any other big exchange.

In December Coinbase crashed multiple times and it still is a pain to withdraw coins, my Ethereum transfer took 12+ hours. They haven't replied to support messages, they are just shit and obviously overloaded. I have left them for good.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:09:44
Can anyone explain how my Bitcoin transaction from Bitstamp to Binance only took 10 mins and pretty much 0 fees? It has never been this fast or cheap over the past few months. Did I just get lucky that network demand is low?
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:11:27
Many exchanges are absolute rip offs. Its the reason why Binance achieved the number 1 spot so quickly.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:52:31
Well I don't know about registration since I am European. Considering the current problems with the fiat to crypto exchanges; another option is to use localbitcoin to get Bitcoin and then you can transfer that to Binance. Have had a few friends do that with success.

People please just leave Coinbase! They are providing one of the worst services out there and shouldn't even be accepting new customers. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:49:22
Its not a Ponzi Scheme, thats for sure, but they do provide a terrible service. Thats a fact and I have heard countless stories of it. They are obviously driven by greed and should have shut new registrations down back in December.
I barely use them and have had a poor exprience:
Ethereum transfer from Coinbase to Binance took 12-15 hours. I also contacted support in November regarding an issue, I have still not heard back from them.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:34:53
And they deserve to be left in the dust. Binance blocking new sign ups is protecting existing users, something Coinbase should have done a long time ago.

At the moment Bitcoin can't be used as a currency, its obvious that Litecoin is suprerior in this aspect. But coins that are used as a currency will be far more volatile in the future, because retailers will be selling in masses when they think the price is going down. Bitcoin because of its high fees is far more suitable for long term store of value. Once Bitcoin has finally been accepted and its market cap balloon, watch it become a stable currency.
A store of value only for the wealthy? Look at Venezuela and Zimbabwe, these aren't exactly wealthy countries are they?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:52:47
I see the store of value being more valuable for the next few years than form of payment. No big business is going to accept a crypto with the volatility it currently has and taking on Paypal and others is going to take years as well. Bitcoin is the only currency that currently has a HUGE real use case.
Its like gold but better, no upkeep fee, no minimum capital requirement and everyone with a mobile phone and internet access can buy it.

Go ahead, follow the drug dealers, they always make excellent life choices.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:20:09
But this is in the west, I have a feeling it is far less in Asia and the Middle East. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:36
Yeah a ton of stop loss orders going through will do that. I have fallen victim to drops like this before and do not set them anymore. Just Hold
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:01:50
Yes its lost its original utility, but what stops it from becoming a store of value similar to gold or the swiss franc? No central authority plus no upkeep fee. Can't be influenced by partnership deals, bad interviews and will most likely not be sold off by the masses, because its not used for commerce. The only thing Bitcoin needs is to gain the trust of the masses.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:01:20
First to market is a massive advantage as you can see.
2. It is not centralised, no spokesperson can give a bad interview, no CEO can lead Bitcoin in a certain direction. Humans inevitably make mistakes. By having a community you minimise such risks, similar to why a company has a board.
3. The coins are far more distributed, although around 1000 people own 40%, that is far more distributed and less controlled by the big boys than Bitcoin Cash and other coins.
4. The Bitcoin community focus on security and decentralisation, over fast/cheap transactions. This makes it more suitable as a long term store of value, that doesn't have an upkeep (digital gold), hopefully lower volatility in the future and one that the people trust because of its proven track record. 
Lets see how Bcash scales, but just 1 month ago the number of transactions were lower than those of Dogecoin. If it can live up to its scalability claims is another question. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:21:01
And if you look at total number of transactions Bitcash only surpassed Doge a few weeks ago
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:59:05
Lightining may be suitable to gain traction again, but so many people miss the value Bitcoin has as 'digital gold'. High transfer times even help Bitcoin in this aspect.

About to post an article about how I think Bitcoin will carry on its reign for a while, you should check it out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:55
And the comments by the bitcoin.com guy are released on the same day. Quite the coincidence eyy?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:52:12
its a shit coin. In comparison to other coins it has nothing special, Roger Ver is psycho and it is very centralised. If the average transaction value is around 200'000 USD, you know that large amounts are owned by a select few.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:30:22
The average wage has nothing to do with it, its a store of value! AND Bitcoin fees are based on the size of transaction, I assume you just pulled this 20 dollar figure out of thin air.
Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places, so you can purchase very small amounts. If you put 100 USD into Bitcoin and it increases by 50% over the year, you gain 50 USD. Whereas in the meantime lets say the Venezuela Bolivar has decreased by 60% to the dollar over the year (you lose 60USD), it actually decreased by this amount in November 2016 alone, but for simplicity sake lets say over the whole year. In this scenario, by investing in Bitcoin you would have 110 USD more then if you would have kept the money in your native currency. Lets say fees are very high and your total gain is 100 dollars, that can still get you quite far in a country like Venezuela. 
Before you dismiss something with 'bollocks' I recommend you do the maths first.

Nice buy, what a year its had. I still feel quite a few of these smaller e-commerce companies have big upside potential.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:41
Massive manipulation going on, Coinbase should be prosecuted for this.
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:36:31
This company has been around for quite sometime using Bitcoin for loans. It also is definitely not a bank. Completely misleading title.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:40:02
Where do these screenshots come from?
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:58:35
No idea if this legend is still giving out, but praying I am. Keep building your business man, dedicated people is what this industry needs.

Nicely said, have to agree with you that car loans will definitely not surpass the housing bubble of 2008. 
Though I still do believe that a ton of people will default at the same time and the banks will end up with a load of cars on their hands, that they will have to sell at a discount. The large majority of us will see some photos of parking lots at the port filled with second-hand cars ready to be shipped off to some foreign market. Whilst those living in remote areas at the lowest end of the poverty line will be the ones that suffer.
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:17:08
Interesting theory, although I believe you are underestimating the number of people that will default once a recession eventually hits.
Although there is a demand for used cars, the current state of car loans has led to a lot of high-end cars being purchased. When a recession hits, people will have to sell these off after they cant afford the monthly installments. The only problem being is that the that everyone will be trying to unload those premium cars at the same time and far fewer people than before will be able to afford the merc and bmws. So people will default and the banks/car dealerships will be left with a ton of cars on their hands that they cant sell.

If you change the scenario of course you would have different results. Thats clear and I believe most people who voted are aware of that. Still the poll shows how there is significantly more trust in Bitcoin than US treasury bonds and I dont think that would change even if you do change the source of money.

Wouldn't be surprised if he has traded on insider information or laundered money. But also what he does could hopefully be classified as high pressure sales tactics. What him and his fellow cronies are doing should be classified as manipulative and deceptive practices to sell securities, which is illegal! Though unfortunately cryptos aren't securities YET. I am no lawyer, but there is definitely a possibility that he could be charged with one of the above or similar. So next time do some research or thinking before you make a stupid comment.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:28:58
All media stations push their own agenda which is determined by the owners. Maybe the owners bought cheap during the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:48:41
Would really be great to see Roger Ver taken to court, he is just absolute scum.
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:18:44
Cryptocurrencies are basically being put on the same list as counterfeit and sexually explicit ads. This is rather shocking, especially as so many projects are actually fully functioning businesses. If crypto is banned, so should casino/gambling websites, loan ads, penny stocks etc., the list could go on. 
I understand that many ads are probably misleading, but an outright ban is not the right approach.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:36:58
I agree they are very good and my go to channel. Still they have their Western biases, as thats the market they cater to.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:00:11
The whole stock market dip was created to further push down the price of crypto so they could enter. They started secretly buying late last year.

I like this analogy: Imagine a transaction is a boulder that needs to be moved from A to B. BCash's solution in order to move these boulders is by introducing a thicker rope, which of course helps. But let's say you want to move bigger boulders, do you just make thicker and thicker rope? Bitcoin's solution is to introduce leverage, like for example a pulley. This allows you to pull many times bigger boulders than you could with just thicker rope. This is Segwit and by using sidechains you may be sacrificing speed at the moment, but in the future, once fully adopted (adoption rates currently between 10-15%) Bitcoin could process many times more transactions than Visa. BCash has no plan on adopting anything similar, has no real scaling solution or even any significant developer backing.
Remember its just an analogy, so not completely accurate.

I understand well enough that humans will always be biased. Even if a news station tried to be completely neutral, the reporters would still unintentionally be biased by what they decide to report on or how the article is written.
Would be impressed if you can give me one news station that takes a completely neutral standpoint on crypto or on news in general?

Is a deflationary currency really beneficial for the economy though?
