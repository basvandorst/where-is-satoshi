If it comes to that I will just sell it and try not cry everyday at night. I was greedy, it's my fault.
I already had a small amount that I bought at 7-8k, it was great. Then I sold stocks that were going nowhere and bought way more at 19k afraid of losing more gains. (I know, diversify is always the way to go, I learned my lesson now) The losses outweighs the gains I made earlier.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:30:28
How much were you holding?
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:28:17
I just checked on copay wallet, the minimum amount I can pay for a transaction is 112 sats, and that's called super economic. Yesterday it was 250.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:45:51
LoL calm down man. What's the problem?
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:54:59
Dude, chill.

Jesus Christ... The things I have to read.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:50:27
I'm in the same position bro. Just waiting to recover my losses.
It kinda hurts buying the top, and then seeing bitcoin in this position.

I'm not that tech savvy. I only have one computer which I use for school, streaming, gaming and watching porn, also I don't have an habit of using vpns/tor.
Fairly sure my money is safer in the exchange than with me.

Why did you sell :( afraid of a dip?
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:55:22
Me too
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:40:02
Yup, can confirm. Moving 1000 dollars of my savings when I was 18 was nerve wracking.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:43:29
But, I thought the only problem about telling how much you own is if you tell in bitcoins which is precise so people can find your wallet.
Like, I hold my bitcoins on a exchange with password authentication so it's impossible to hack me basically. Isnt it?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:20:20
Isn't that because they removed Korean exchange market from the graph?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:48:12
You have to buy in person. Exchange with someone who owns bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:12:33
A respect you man. Did you felt nauseous or something in the 22 of december?

Holy fuck man. 45 cent? Jesus Christ.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:04:53
Yea but then I'm vulnerable to things like a house fire. Which I think is more likely :/ there's no perfect solution unless I really own a lot of money in which case I can use the services of people who have bunkers of cold storage.

I don't think it's that much when you realize that you can check in seconds, 3 seconds I unlock my phone and check the price using a widget, i think i check way more than 85 times.
When you say EIGHTY FIVE it sounds like a lot but when you consider the time, it's not.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:19:44
The things you have to say on the Internet...
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:22:35
Such a fucking loser you are.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:35:07
Yup, I get that. 
I just repeated what people have been saying, that the bigger blocks are a short-term solution. That's why I don't agree with it I prefer the Bitcoin Core way.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:58:33
Which narrative dude? For the third time, I not an expert nor have I said I was.
You can check my logs and see that a week ago I made a post about buying bitcoin tomorrow on this sub-reddit. And after I posted asking about bitcoin core, and also that I posted about running a bitcoin core node.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:33:57
It is indeed open source but the reality is, how many of you understand code?
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:44:57
Did the segwit2x thing already happened?
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:34:29
Hello u/Frogolocalypse :D
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:05:39
Isn't finding something pretty very subjective?
Anyway, it's not like the only alternative bitcoin has to be faster in trade is by doubling the block size.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:18:59
I have the impression that you misunderstand what I've said and is trying to discuss.
From what I read in your other posts is seems to me that I agree with your point, which is that you are probably a Bitcoin Core guy. So what are we discussing?
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:09:03
If the forks occurs which side are you gonna be on? 
I heard that the segwit side already has 90% of the miners onboard. Wouldn't that make the non-segwit side very slow and basically unusable which would mean that they would lose value?
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:36:43
So you mean corporations with big money were spamming the network with small transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:53:14
Not gonna lie... LMAO
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:30:21
What are your bets on? Segwit or core?
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:27:19
Did the segwit2x thing already happened?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:39:14
Okay, then educate me about it. 
Which part of the statement is incorrect? That most people run mobile wallets? Or that most of the wallets are run by people who support segwit2x? Or both?
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:19:35
Even worse then, right?
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:43:02
Yea, I meant Segwit2x vs Core.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:26:03
I get that.
But in reality most people aren't gonna be running nodes. They will do what is easier, which right know is a mobile wallet. 
You telling me that everyday people running mobile wallets on android are as safe as tech-savy people running a full node on linux?
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:32:23
No I mean like buying smaller value things frequently will cause you to lose money if done through bitcoin right know. Like 10 purchases of 2 dollars stuff.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:09:45
"Well that's just ridiculous"
Don't even tell me about it. LOL.
"Same holds true for crypto."
If I am using it for payments then yes. But also there's a lot of ways to make transactions "disappear".
Also, there isn't legislation about bitcoin yet, so I'm safe, and I'm pushing for it not to exist. Still have a chance.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:03:25
How so? Banks are controlled by government and if I try to buy anything major in cash (like a car) I'm going straight to jail, getting out only if I can prove with utter certainty where the money came from and that I have declared all of it in my yearly tax returns.
Maybe legislation is different in your country.
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:28:50
Doesn't bigger blocks make transactions easier?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:55:25
What? I do understand that. When have I stated the contrary?
Also, I don't know what is it that you told me I said. I haven't stated nothing, so far I only made questions, mostly. ????
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:18:20
"Some people will run the new nodes. "
How do you know this? I'm not uninstalling my Bitcoin Core node.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:59:01
Nice man, thanks. Why isn't that frequently talked about here? It should have a fixed post if its this important. I'm running it right now.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:40:06
Isn't there other ways to make the transactions faster other than increasing the block size and making a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:19:05
Hm... But we can't prove that can we?
How do you know it's a single developer?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:48:13
LOL you're a maniac.
I'm not a participant of rbtc. And you can't have a conversation normally with me even though I'm on your "side". JFC. Bye.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:33:02
Dude what I said about the people running nodes is that most people are gonna be using mobile wallets that in majority are ran by people who support Segwit2x. So these people can be used as maneuver mass to advance it without even realizing it.
Which is why I said that people running nodes from Bitcoin Core are protected. Do you disagree?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:44:23
No, no, obviously the medium of exchange is important. LOL.
What I meant was that it doesnt need to be THAT fast (5s) or that cheap ($0.01) to have value.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:57:32
So do I need to worry about anything? (not referring to value)
I'm just gonna buy half of a bitcoin and store it on Copay. When the hard fork comes do I need to worry about which side of the fork am I gonna be?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:28:24
Yep, I agree.
My point was that the transaction doesn't need to be that fast if you're not using it to buy everyday groceries. And that it still can hold value even if it has slow transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:04:03
Don't they wanna avoid the growing size of the blockchain?
I mean, to be a node today you need to download 150GB, that would be double with 2x.
Isn't that a problem? Don't we need to make being nodes as easy as possible?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:13:56
I'm no expert, lol, I've stated that in the post.
What I don't understand is what point are you trying to make O.o ? Just simplify it I will say if I agree or not, and if I don't know whether or not to agree, I will ask for information.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:17:00
Calm down man. It's gonna get confirmed, it's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:34:50
Fair enough.
Ultimately it depends where the money is.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:12:00
Oh nice, so it's not gonna be consuming a lot of processing right?
A node is basically like a bridge that people can use. Correct? Like seeding torrent.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:17:35
Okay, but I've only said that because it is what people in this sub-reddit have been saying.
Here people told me that 90% of payments are made in platforms supported by people who support Segwit2x like Bitpay. Which isn't to say that these are real "people".
That's why r/Bitcoin thinks that this is an attack on the network to force people adhere to Segwit2x.
That's why r/Bitcoin thinks it isn't a good idea to double block size because the attacks can make the double size not enough again.
I assume that this being a r/Bitcoin narrative that you agree with it, as I do. Or again, maybe I am missing something or wrote something wrong.
Also, English is not my first language and you shouldn't assume that everyone posting here has absolute mastery of the language.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:07:44
What are the ideas they are using to advance it then?
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:27:08
Nice impartial point man.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:07:06
In a world where bitcoin becomes mainstream do you really expect everyone who has their own life to check on bitcoin code every update?
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:11:01
Hum.. Core is open-source and is a community. I value that a lot.
Who are the agents behind Segwit2x? are they public?
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:22:55
Agree 100%.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:06:10
That's what I meant........
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:39:24
Not in the sense of what I said but in the sense that I know truth can sound harsh even though it may not be my intention.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:42:37
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:25:34
??? What is it that I said then?
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:17:22
 But now, does this changes need to be made in long term steady decisions or shaky short term decisions? That is the one million dollar question.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:51:48
Are you insane? Check my logs and you will see that I have no posts there and I have had this account long before ever knowing about bitcoin because of Dota 2 so I couldn't have created this just to post here.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:08:44
So this software from Bitcoin Core, is gonna be using my computer as a miner basically?
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:20:03
Definitely me. LOL
Luckily before the "correction" I had already lost 20% on a stock the day before. So I was like, "okay, just another bad thing to happen"
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:01:47
"The only convincing economic explanation I've found is that it's use as a medium of exchange gives it fundamental value. "
That's what you've come up with. In my opinion bitcoin's value is security and anonymity, a way to run from taxation of governments.
"Now, some at this point might want to say that Bitcoin's fundamental value comes from its utility as a store of value. I'd say that's circular reasoning, but let's think about how that would play out. "
It is circular reasoning, okay, but for example, the only reason gold has value is because as a species we have decided so. Also, for all we know a gigantic and easy to explore gold mine can be found at anytime, which would dramatically reduce gold's value. Still, people use it to store value to this day.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:33:03
You didn't get what I said, right? Okay.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:39:35
"At least less politically motivated", you can't prove that and you're talking out of your ass. This affirmation relies completely on mere speculation and it's not objectively verifiable. I'm sorry to be so blunt.

Deflation is a "myth", are you actually going to starve just so you can get more money?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:20:59
If people are saving instead of buying, it means there's more savings which means less interest rates. Interest rates are higher when people are not saving. Generally speaking that's how it should be, but governments control the interest.
Also, it's 's not like that. People have needs, I don't wait to buy the new iPhone just because in a year there is going to be a better iPhone. And the fact that people will be buying less means that companies will have to come up with more appealing reasons to spend money. We see that in the gaming industry with the most various tactics almost forcing the player to buy on day one.
