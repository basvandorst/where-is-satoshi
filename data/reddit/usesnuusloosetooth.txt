I mean.. I really hope so! I am invested. I was just hoping to get some alt thoughts on whether the hope still lives, and how much should it hold the test.

Valid question.. Carnage I guess?

That's how it used to be - and more! Alt spring didn't end up being how it was supposed to. And Flippening my ass..

Wonder when this naiive optimism will run out? Seriously. Has this relationship between the holders and crypto just turned completely ill? Like a too-good-for-their-own-good spouse that just takes a bearing after a beating and keeps saying that their partner still has a golden heart.. I've been in the game since early 2017, got too good to be true returns, invested more at ATH and after, and after, and after.. But somehow the past month, I've started to think more and more that maybe this was a fad. Like the ATH prices absolutely never meant to be so ridiculous and we're approaching the close to pennies and fractions prices that these silly things are worth at best in the real-real. Maybe. So I guess, in short, the FOMO is fogging out. Yesterday several of my price alarms got trickered, some at lows I didn't really expect to see. 6 months ago, I would have throught: yay - money on sale! Now I just see it as a next hit to the nail of this coffin. What about you, fellow cryptoboys?

That.. And the sudden brutal closing of doge and ltc markets. That hurt many so bad.

It's speculative value, like any stock, or holding. Apple is not, by its physical assets, worth their stock value.

So... 2 years to next ATH?
