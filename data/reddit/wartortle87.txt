Yeah, they cleared all the BCH/BTC orders that were gonna dump ~1000 bch for Bitcoin and say tomorrow morning it will go post only mode again for an hour but won't actually trade unless *it looks liquid enough*.    
    
Inb4 tomorrow morning when there are 1000 sell orders again but they still don't open it so they can prop up bch price a little longer.

I did a wire last week that was available about 10 hours later, and I did a wire this morning that was available about 2 hours later.    
    
A bank *transfer* however will likely take a few days if I'm not mistaken
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:14
They were nice enough to prevent over  1000 bcash from moving to BTC by clearing the BCH/BTC exchange from yesterday...so frustrating
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:30:34
Nice work. I always have had the reverse effect, perfectly time my purchases before massive tanks :( but I haven't bought for a bit so.. this one's not on me!

Sending question that I previously thought I knew the answer to: if i have some coin on coinbase that I want to get on my trezor should I move it to gdax first or straight to trezor from cb?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:11:21
The sell wall on gdax at the time of the original post

Lol, suddenly sellers are pioneers of thought
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:01:41
Im no finance guru and only broke my Bitcoin cherry this week but yeah, the idea that Bitcoin is suddenly only for the whales who can throw cash around for daily gains seems counterproductive to adoption.

Are taxes owed on each day trade sale (assuming a profit), or only when you withdraw from the exchange?

Don't worry everyone! I just bought another sizeable chunk so it's destined to dip.    
You're welcome.    
    
*Edit: Ok.. shit.. calm down dip*
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:56:38
When are they gonna stop propping up the price and allow those trades in the BCH/BTC on gdax go through?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:13:54
Look at the massive wall in the BCH/BTC exchange
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:10:15

Same. I love my trezor and it fits my needs. Is it *better*? Idk.

Lol wow, they just wiped them off. Smh
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:49:37
Hmm is right. I'm starting to see a trend ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:59
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:21:53
I may not always buy at the right time (spent all of my 2nd big buy-in at 17600 literally 1 second before it plunged into the most recent dip), but not HODLing never crossed my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:49
All the reactionary softies on coinbase(gdax), guess that's where all my *"yeah right it will never go that low"* limit buys will be going forward
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:31:11
A combination of the availability of money in the exchange and not having the benefit of hindsight my friend. It's ok, most of my holdings were bought much lower.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:37:04
Thought it would be him running off the edge on fire, either way you got a good laugh from me
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:49:40
..lucky. I was trying to get in during Vegeta memes but didn't get all set up,  verified, wired etc til 11k. Set a limit buy for 9500 and caught it on the dip before the current rise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:34:22

@_date: 2017-12-07 03:09:18
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:45:05
For sure. That's my plan past the initial plunge
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:20:33
Haha I'm like reverse fucking Nostradamus. Went deep on another buy at 17600 and I swear to god my confirmation triggered this plunge. It was fucking immediate.    
*Hold me while I HODL*
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:07:56
If y'all could wait to dip till the weekend is over and I can get some money available..that'd be great.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:26:04
I'm still on the outside looking in waiting for my wire to be available..
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:12:33
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:00:32
Damn. I'm noobie too but went with a wire yesterday morning, funds cleared to gdax late last night.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:56:11
I did the same today, with the same result :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:33:33
Even in a wire expect a delay. Wired to gdax this morning about 10am PT and it didn't clear. *Hopefully soon*..
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:24:48
Damn. Mine ended up clearing late last night so it was about 10 hours. Good luck
