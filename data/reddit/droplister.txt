This isn't true. XCP is the most common trading pair, but people often trade BITCRYSTALS for SoG trading cards.


You forget to mention SJCX (Storj) and all the Spells of Genesis trading cards.


There are no fiat pegged assets yet, but a Tether-like asset could emerge in the future. In the meantime, the most common used trading pair is XCP because it can be escrowed while BTC cannot, but it's used as the closest thing to the USD you can get on this system today.


This remains the biggest untruth in your essay.


I would suggest looking at Storj and CoinDaddy.io.


You really are going to suggest Uphold as an alternative? Yikes. And for Open Assets, colored coins is a different approach than Counterparty which may have its own advantages and disadvantages, but its mere existence does not refute Counterparty.


Look, Counterparty is a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. People are using it. It's likely very, very early for protocols such as Counterparty and those like it. But Counterparty, being built on top of Bitcoin, doesn't need to do a whole lot to continue existing. So long as Bitcoin exists, Counterparty exists. Ethereum, being built on its own blockchain, has a whole different set of challenges for its continued existence.

Counterparty is a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. It allows you to issue, send, and trade "assets" on the blockchain.
It does this by defining a set of message types (ex: issue, send) that can be encoded into bitcoin transactions.
The Bitcoin blockchain is monitored for these messages and they are indexed and evaluated by federated nodes which come to consensus on which assets are issued, how many "tokens" they have, which addresses have what balances, etc.
So, here's what a Counterparty transaction "looks like" (not really):
ISSUE ASSET
To: 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr
Send: 0.00000543 BTC
Fee: 0.0001 BTC
Encoded: {"Create": ASSET, "Quantity": 10000000}
SEND ASSET
FROM: 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr
TO: Some bitcoin address
Send: 0.00000543 BTC
Fee: 0.0001 BTC
Encoded: {"Send": 10000 ASSET}
In this example, I create an asset and then send some quantity of that asset. It's made possible by sending the minimum amount of bitcoin possible, paying the miner's fee, and encoding the Counterparty transaction data inside. Bitcoin is programmable money.
This makes Bitcoin our data store, and bitcoin transactions our "save" function. Counterparty federated servers evaluate that data for validity and determine the current state of the network.
To some people, it's controversial as it adds "weight" to the chain, it also bloats the UTXO pool, if you don't sweep the "dust" you create, but I see it as extending Bitcoin's functionality.
Some cool features include:
- Issuing dividends
- Voting
- Decentralized exchange

Anyone who starts from the premise that middlemen are evil, all businesses fail due to competition, and we're going to blockchain all the things shouldn't be taken seriously.
"Fermat is designed as a huge master plan, a huge system, covering all possible use cases. What we are proposing is anybody building a piece of this system can own that piece. That means that the system is divided into thousands of pieces. And whoever owns a piece of this system is entitled to get micropayments from endusers once the system is live and running all over the place."
What would you call a person who owns a piece and gets a micropayment of all transactions? Middlemen replaced by... piece-owning-men? There's too much stupid to go over it all.
So many people come to the mountain to tell you they are going to reinvent everything, just as it was, and people buy it, hook line and sinker.

There are no Bitcoin ATMs inside the airports, but you have a couple near Newark. The one in Lower Manhattan, that you might presume is on Wall Street, is actually inside the Staten Island Ferry terminal.

Denominating in BTC instead of USD will probably cause them some problems, no?
"So on a day the SP500 goes up 2 percent, your allocation to the SP500 goes up 2 percent in Bitcoin terms (i.e. 1BTC becomes 1.02BTC)."

Smart contracts, as I understand them, have certain properties that make them distinct from, say... just an API. The same way the Bitcoin blockchain has certain properties that make it different from any other ledger, database, data store- pick your analogy.
I think smart contracts and the Bitcoin blockchain are both narrowly focused on the problem of digital value transfer. This specialized kind of function differentiates them from other types of message passing.
I expect a smart contract to encumber some value with conditions such that, if met, that value will be transferred as expected 100% of the time. That transfer should be final and irreversible forever, ideally, longer than your lifetime minimum. Settled. I shouldn't have to trust that to be the case, it should be like gravity. It's just a fact, Jack.
This makes me think bitcoin transactions themselves are smart contract-y. Especially, when you get into multisignature and hierarchical deterministic wallets. You can't argue with  the Bitcoin blockchain. And you don't have to trust the Bitcoin blockchain to act as excepted. You can verify and validate for yourself.
But I don't really know. Smarts contracts are not something that captures my interest like bitcoin the currency does.
I think the use cases of a smart contract are far too exotic for me to have a need for one.

I heard about DropZone before OpenBazaar, but my understanding is that OpenBazaar used to be called DarkMarket. And it had more or less that same goal as DropZone: to create a decentralized marketplace enabled by Bitcoin.
But when you evaluate the outcomes of each project...
1) DropZone delivered an innovative protocol built on top of Bitcoin.
2) OpenBazaar delivered something like a website that's hard to find.
OpenBazaar is not a Bitcoin project and it's not censorship resistant. They chose to iterate away from a good idea that's hard to implement to a bad idea that's easy to implement.
Is there a feud? Not really. You have one side stating the obvious, "This is not a Bitcoin project. This is not censorship resistant. This doesn't matter." And another side saying, "This is a Bitcoin project. This is decentralized. This is going to be big." One is all hype. One is all code.

OpenBazaar has "no fees", but it has hidden costs. Well, hidden if you ignore the reality and buy the hype full-stop.
If you setup a banana stand on the side of the road, in the middle of nowhere, maybe no one charges you any fees, but you'll also have no customers.
Opportunity costs are real. This is a terrible opportunity for anyone looking to sell legal products online.
You'd be much better served by a website. A website like a Shopify account might provide or Craigslist can be used for one-off listings. Sure there are "evil middle man fees" but you'll have customers.
If fees are holding you back from doing business, you're doing something wrong. Or you're user.
@_date: 2016-02-19 07:49:05
So, the bigger picture you've described sounds a lot more like a pipe dream than a reasonable outcome that I should consider.
To start, OpenBazaar doesn't compete with eBay.
Alibaba and Amazon compete with eBay, sure. They're all marketplace websites on the world wide web. Right? But, OpenBazaar is a lot more "ambitious" (stupid?) than that.
**IMO** - OpenBazaar is competing on two fronts.
1) To be your browser.
Against: Google Chrome, IE, Firefox, and Safari.
2) To be your search engine.
Against: Google, Yahoo, Bing.
Unfortunately, OpenBazaar doesn't know this. If you don't know you're competing with GOOGLE... well. There's not enough magical thinking in the world for me to believe that they will succeed at that task with no budget -- even if the developers disappear.
**IMO** - You need a compelling reason to use a specialized browser and niche search engines. BitTorrent is a great example where it works, but the compelling reason is obviously that you can get free content that you can't get for free anywhere else.
Will *you* be selling products for free on OpenBazaar?
**IMO** - The fact that there are no listing/success fees is not that compelling to me. Because fees are just one cost, and they're often the smallest of all costs anyways.
It's free to list my products for sale on PasteBin.com, but I don't do that because there are no customers there. It would be an opportunity cost to waste my time promoting my wares somewhere customers were not.
I'm WILLING to pay to get customers. All businesses are. Because there's an opportunity cost of just hoping people find you instead too.
You know who is attracted by "no fees"? Cheap people. Cheap people are the worst kind of ecommerce customer you can have.
**IMO** - OpenBazaar harps on "no fees", so that you will ignore the new costs. There are SO MANY costs that come with switching or adopting OpenBazaar.
You instantly shrink your reach to a tiny, tiny, tiny, market. Take all internet connected devices (billions) and remove all the ones who don't have OpenBazaar installed.
That means you'll spend more time and $ per customer acquired. OpenBazaar fans seem to think OB has killed advertising some how, but they haven't.
For existing customers, you'll have to educate them about OpenBazaar and you'll probably have major attrition rates. For new customers, same thing. You're going to have to drag them off the internet into some weirdo software they have to install and learn.
You know how easily people abandon shopping carts, right? Right?
You're basically subsidizing their marketing campaign.
Just imagine if a successful ecommerce website tried to switch to OpenBazaar. It's not like they can 301 you to OpenBazaar. It's going to look like you shut down your website, or that you went out of business, or that you were hacked.
**IMO** - SALES create "word of mouth" marketing. You don't start from there. But suppose we magically did have word of mouth going on before we made like any sales, you can't even link a person to the store. How the heck do you think that's gonna work?
**IMO** - If it's not worth listing on eBay, it's not worth listing anywhere. It's not going to sell.
**IMO** - Websites are stupid easy to make these days and stupid cheap to host. The hassle is minimal and the benefits are obvious.
The internet is the cheap access to global markets. OpenBazaar is expensive access to thin markets clustered in a few geographic locations. And it will always be that way.
How's that for big picture?

I think it's probably premature to call Peter's reaction "out of proportion" and it's better to err on the side of caution.
There are two points that I think are worth considering...
1) Even if there are no privacy concerns because of encryption, BIP75 may effectively color coins as "high trust" and other coins as "low trust". This is a problem.
IMO - It would harm the fungibility of bitcoins.
You can think of the fungibility issue somewhat like the net neutrality debate. Packets and bitcoins should be transmitted indiscriminately.
If you create a "high trust" vs "low trust" divide, this wedge begins to incentivize and re-insert identity and trust into a network designed in such a way as to not need them.
And extended far enough, the system reverts back to something like Paypal and ceases to be useful.
An extension of the above point... 
2) There's a question then of whether this is a "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal".
Consider that other message storing protocols built on top of the Bitcoin protocol are not BIPs.
Examples: Counterparty, Dropzone, Colu, Factom, Proof-of-Existence.
Why should this be a BIP at all?
