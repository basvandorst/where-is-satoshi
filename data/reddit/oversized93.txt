More or less, a future is a bet of where an individual believes the price of a stock is going to go in a certain period of time. What stock and how long of a time period are both factors that go into pricing of these futures. 
People say that a lot of big banks are going to short bitcoin. Inexperienced investors (or experienced) could see this as “well the top guys say it’s tanking, I better get out now!”  Have 2,000,000 people in that mindset?  BTC drops under $10k

Not entirely true. 1031 exchanges can be done on personal property too (expensive cars, boats, etc) but normally is reserved for higher dollar amount items and a lot of documentation is required to do a 1031 exchange.

Work as a credit analyst at a big bank; 
a lot of the senior investment guys think the futures market will hurt BTC pretty bad; but that’s because a lot of them don’t agree that the real world usages of btc and others is there yet.  Those who are on board with block chain even say the same; the big guys (JPM, Oppen, Chase, etc) will likely do a LOT of shorting. Which alone will scare any non veteran BTC investor, which will likely cause a LOT of selling. Meaning big crash.
