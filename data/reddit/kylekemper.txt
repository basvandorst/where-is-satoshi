Indiegogo doesn't accept bitcoin but I could spin up a Shopify site. I've been looking for a Bitcoin accepting crowdfunding platform and was looking at lighthouse but it requires and an app to run. Any suggestions?

Thanks for the update Matt, you rock, any discount is better than the premium most people pay to use gift cards...I did print 5k bitcoin info cards that said 20% off at Starbucks using Bitcoin...it really is a cherry on top of the bitcoin sunday ;)

Here here BIG! Nick, Victoria, John, Jim, Christian, Bash, Steve, Jenn and everyone else who works/worked there created a badass set of features and helped bring bitcoin to countless new users. Wishing Nick and all the employees who transition to AirBnB success in their new role; their knowledge and expertise will be fresh air to the fast growing forward facing juggernaut that is AirBnB. I hope that the platform lives on because a no-fee, instant, no minimum off-chain bitcoin social payments solution with API's is key to network scalability IMO. I'm here for you guys if you want any help. send BIGbtc a taco please

oops. That page is from the Hackathon in Miami...early blueprints. The wallet itself charges no fees. Need to fix that. thanks for highlighting that problem dave. 5000 bits

Very valid observation but I assure you this is not the case. Ultimately it will take 21M to bring digital wallets and self-sovereign ID to the world; can we reach this in a day, a week, a month? Unlikely but to say never I think underestiamtes the power of the people.  Also, we do not need it all at once.  Generosity is an ongoing crowdfunding platform that charges no fees.   The app is going to launch hopefully next Monday on iPhone assuming we get apple approval. This is me, Kyle Kemper, been in the space for years but have realized we have a problem with experience and the social wallet aims to solve that. You can call me if you want me to verify and ask any questions. PM me and i'll give you my direct number. -Kemper

In terms of decentralization I compare us to a physical wallel; just digital with no profit motives. Luis Vitton has no control over your wallet...and neither will we.  We're just building the wallet platform with a focus on amazing UX. It comes empty and it's up to you to put what you want in it. We will not store your keys. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 06:41:43
it's not better it's different. Bitcoin wallets are bitcoin wallets, this is going to be more like a traditional wallet, you'll be able to put anything in it.

Ok 10-4. I'm going to get the security specialists to address your concerns. Do you have questions you'd like answered @_date: 2016-04-04 16:01:10
* 1) It is to be a digital wallet; not just a bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin is the best digital currency right now so it was natural to use it as the first money for the wallet. Ultimately it will be able to hold all money and the user can decide what is right for them.
* 2) It's really easy to use and beautiful; we've taken most of the QR codes and bitcoin addresses out of the user experience without comprimissing security. 
* 3)It is a platform for digital identity
* 4)We're not selling equity to raise funds because there is no equity; it has no profit motives and is going to be a NFP.  Our motives are to give everyone access to an easy to use digital wallet. Think Wikipedia but for wallets
* 5)It will have an app store where anyone can develop to it and integrate their services (~2 months out)
* 6)It's a hybrid bitcoin Changetip wallet to give people access to fee-free transactions, including micro, under $25.
The app will be launching next week for iPhone. 
Great Question! Given your expertise hexorx, what steps would you recommend? PM if you're interested in helping

Update: 37 hours ago I started this project because I wanted to build my daughter a bitcoin piggy bank. Yesterday, at the maker space i work from we created 2 prototypes. One is solid oak and basically a toy that also acts as a bank. The other is thinner and is more for putting on your desk or wall. I was hoping that the costs would be low but this isn't mass production. These units are art and I think the price points are reflective of the cost and value put into them. 
[I gave one to my friend for his newborn]( and after about 1 minute he understood that it was actually a savings account with the key on the back.

Great question. We're looking at solutions like one name right now and some others. The idea being you have a wallet that stores the keys/tokens to your identities that lie on blockchains and with your key + theirs the info gets unlocked.  The digital identity component is in vision stage and the app will launch as a bitcoin/changetip hybrid. V2 will feature app store and ID integrations.  Anyone interested in helping out please PM me. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 13:02:13
The goal is 21M, which may sound like a lot but is not that much given the scope of the project. Also the project has no fixed time; in my mind a huge milestone will be when we hit 1% of the funding goal. 
Think about it, to build a horizontal digital wallet platform that services the world we need the best in development, security, legal, communications, design, branding, social media, marketing, business development &amp; outreach.
This isn't just a browser extension or a tipping platform, this is bringing bitcoin &amp; digital identity to the everyman or woman. The feedback is excellent and will help us make the campaign clearer and more effective. Thanks theonevortex 1000 bits

Hey Xio, No need to be sorry. Social Wallet...

We're planning on relaunching the crowdfunding when our non-profit foundation registration goes through and the app is ready for public; weeks not months...fingers crossed. 
The app should be ready for private beta in the next week or so. If you want to be a beta tester leave your email on

Check this out. When I’m out for dinner with friends I’ll always offer to pay in Crypto. I offer them the chance to pay the bill and then I’ll send them crypto. It almost always involves setting them up with a wallet and giving them 10 minute crash course in how the wallet works. I recommend Edge wallet ( as it supports lots of coins and uses a beautiful username/password system that doesn’t require writing a seed out while also being non-custodial. 
The benefit to paying others as opposed to gift cards is it’s not putting sell side pressure on the market (when you use a gift card they usually sell the crypto immediately). Using the method I recommend is actually a p2p exchange + it activates others with a wallet and gets them on board and understanding of how it actually works.

"Digital currencies are considered a commodity and are subject to the barter rules of the Income Tax Act. Not reporting income from such transactions is illegal."
Imo bitcoin is also:
A transaction network 
A store of value 
A ledger of account
A currency
It doesn't fit into yesterday's categories neatly and we should be rethinking policy with the future in mind.

another example... Canadian Pension Plan (responsible for safeguarding the peoples pension &amp; value) has 366 Billion in Assets under management...call it wealth.
366B / 256T \* 21m = 30,023.4375 BTC
current market price for that... $194,251,340.39
It's a drop in the bucket for a fund like that...for now...
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:33:06
for example, if you have $1 Million worth of wealth and the world wealth is 256 Trillion (according to Credit Suisse) and the total supply of Bitcoin is 21m then...
256T/1M \* 21M = 0.08203125 BTC or 82,031.25 bits

My recommendation: 
if your employer has enough cash on hand request that they take your annual salary and  buy a lump sum of bitcoin; then put it in a multi-sig wallet that you, your employer, and a neutral 3rd party have the keys to. Every month or time Period you request the fixed amount. You win if it goes up, you lose if it goes down. Doesn't need to be 100% either. 
My 2 cents

For 1 BTC I can probably get an enormous try bitcoin billboard in a major city for a month and have a world class artist make it beautiful...btw good on ya Dean! Hit me on LI or twitter or via PM if you want to discuss further.

agreed but Tipping cab drivers, bellboys, bartenders, homeless people, etc. with mbtc and not bits will help.  Also you can use TipMe to send larger amounts of value easily between friends. One friend pays for the cab; simply send him $5 vis his/her TipMe; its a really easy way to get into it. +you don't need a unique login; it just uses smart logins w your social media.

We just arrived to Rincon, went to the beach, got a beer and a tequila, I asked the lovely man if he had heard of bitcoin. He had. I asked him if he had any on his phone. He didn’t. I asked him if he would like for me to pay for the beer and tequila w bitcoin. He said ok. I instructed him to go on play store and download edge wallet. He did. It downloaded, and he set it up in about 1.5 minutes. He pressed request BTC and I sent 1111.11 bits as compensation for the beer and tequila. He has bitcoin. I made him a sign. I will check in w him again before I leave. 
To the community of HODLers I suggest that you also put some BTC on your phones for easy GIVLing and SPENDLing. Once everyone has a wallet on their phone we can stop using and touching dirty cash. ��

They don't take a cut.  They only charge 1% on withdrawals. Don't trust it with any more coins than you need in it for tipping.

I think the Tip.Me service is one of the best parts of the offering. It brings it all together and allows for direct, off social network tipping. I am using this as my go to pitch for getting people their first bits. 
There is an issue with it though. It is not clear how you register your domain. The current sign-up process after receiving a twitter tip is as follows:
1. Click the collect tip link in the Changetip mention on Twitter.
You then go to the Changetip landing page where you click "collect Tip" again.
2. You setup your account by authorizing access to Twitter (this is brilliant BTW, makes ChangeTip the best hot wallet solution because you'll never lose access)
3. You collect your tip and are prompted to enter your email address for additional info; so you enter it.
4. You are now setup and signed up; you've collected your tip and are ready to learn more. But what about setting up your johndoe.tip.me domain; this is tantamount to registering your twitter handle but is missing from the process.
To register your custom Tip.me domain you need to go to  and it will suggest a domain for you but then if you click the "snipped of code", which is not obvious, you can then choose a username.
Conclusion: Right now setting up your Tip.Me domain is awkward. I would suggest that as soon as you're in your account and you've collected your tip there is a field to choose your Tip.Me domain.
Tip.Me is an area of your business that can grow like crazy. It can become the socially accessible hot wallet for sending small amounts here and there. It can also turn into its own twitter-esq feed where tipping and value transfer is the content. Also it rolls off the tongue very well.
Thanks for creating this great service!

Online tipping is great but you can also take it offline and really show people the value in Bitcoin and Digital Tipping/Value transfer.   Setup your tip.me accounts with ChangeTip and encourage others to do the same; imo one of the breast ways to get ppl into it quickly.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:01:07
With Bitcoin you push value to another user with no accepting.  With ChangeTip the other user needs to have an account or the funds won't be transferred. With the expiration feature you can send tips to influencers and at least put it on their radar even if they don't accept. But don't send Bits send $'s.
Edit: The Tip.Me feature is also next level and i don't think many people have realized that it can become its own social platform.  Get your domains while they're hot. [kyle.tip.me](
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:02:21
True. But it seems like ChangeTip is the leader and if they can make the TipMe widget synonymous with Tipping like the Facebook like or the Twitter Tweet then it has a chance at going mainstream. It's also a great onboarding tool for new users. TipMe ftw
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:30:45
TipMe is essentially taking ChangeTip to a bigger audience by allowing people to accept Tips directly &amp; discreetly.  As a former server tipping is actually a very private thing so I think TipMe is a huge step in the right direction.  Get your domains while they're hot. [kyle.tip.me](

The purpose of the demonstration was not to showcase the price difference between CAVirtEx and the ATM but how one acquires BTC.  Joseph really shouldn;t have mentioned his price because this distracted from high-level discussion. 
But lets get into the details...why was the price so high on the ATM? Because the operator is a broker and sets their own sell price based on their current order book; which at the time I will confirm was buy heavy resulting in a higher price. We also need to consider the fact that there is only 1 ATM in Ottawa so by all rights they can charge whatever the market is willing to pay.  As more ATM's come online the price will become more competitive but from experience i know that it's still below an average localbitcoiners selling price. 
Overall i think the committee hearing went well. I welcome all the feedback both positive and critical. Thanks

Count me in on the twitter front -   I think Reddit is good but Twitter is great.  I suggest choosing multiple people and sending them enough that it gets their attention.  There are some accounts with serious influence.  There are also a ton of social celebrities that add no value to the world and if they were to use change tip with a charity they may serve some good. 
Twittier profiles i think we should tip:
Joe Rogan, Russell Brand, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Jared Polis, Taylor Swift, Alex from target, Boyhood Movie (likely going to win best picture; IFC film), Charlie Sheen, Glenn Beck, Anderson Cooper, Oprah Winfrey, Justin Beiber, One Direction, etc.  
It's important to get it on their radar and i think if $100 + is collectively sent to each of their accounts there is a chance they could get on board.  
This deserves its own thread. $1 @_date: 2014-11-11 15:29:43

FYI here's the content from the blog post. 
When the dust settles and the history books have been written we think that 2014 will be remembered as a year of foundation building. Following the price rises of 2013, 2014 was a year where investment money flowed into the ecosystem and bitcoin services started becoming more consumer friendly; laying the foundation for mainstream adoption.
At CAVIRTEX, 2014 was a year of growth and relationship building and we look forward to accelerating this trend in the new year. This year the Senate of Canada’s Banking, Trade, and Commerce committee (BTC Committee ;) ) commenced an 18-month in-depth, public, study into digital currencies. Over half way through the study and after having heard experts from a plethora of disciplines, we are confident that the Senate will be making recommendations that further promote innovation within this space in Canada.  CAVIRTEX was honoured to present to the committee in April and help them understand our business and the challenges we face.
In April the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada held the Bitcoin Expo in Toronto and this marked the largest Bitcoin gathering in Canada’s history. The excitement, knowledge exchange, and innovation on display at the Expo was incredible.  CAVIRTEX was pleased to be a gold sponsor and we look forward to participating in future events.
Following the Bitcoin Expo, we bought 10 BitAccess Bitcoin ATM’s as a means of further expanding Bitcoin accessibility in Canada. On August 13th, we officially launched 7 BTM’s in Toronto making it the Bitcoin ATM capital of the world. According to our PR firm, Jesson + Company, the launch received over 72 million impressions across media sources and was trending on the front page of Google News Canada.
In October, the entire CAVIRTEX team converged on Toronto to bring the message of Bitcoin to the world money show. In the days leading up to the show CAVIRTEX was featured on BNN, Sun TV, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and many other new outlets discussing Bitcoin and inviting the public to come visit us at the Money Show. During the show we encouraged members of the Bitcoin community to come down and join us in evangelizing Bitcoin as the future of money.  The passion and enthusiasm of our team and the community helped not only create awareness, but understanding of Bitcoin, the technology, and its potential to transform the future.
2014 was a year that saw many major global brands begin accepting and integrating Bitcoin into their products and services. Dell, Overstock, Expedia, NewEgg, TigerDirect, Wikipedia, Shopify, Time Inc, PayPal, Microsoft, and many others have joined the movement. We feel this is only the beginning and we are anticipating the growth to keep up through 2015.
This fall, the Bitcoin community embraced social tipping as a way of generating bitcoin awareness, saying thank you, and donating to causes that are near and dear. Thanks to the services like ChangeTip, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly consumer friendly and usable.
We firmly believe that Bitcoin is going to flourish thanks to the collaboration of a global, decentralized, network of individuals, organizations, and communities. This Holiday season we would like to give praise and say thank you to this wonderful community for their hard work and dedication. We are truly energized by your passion and enthusiasm and are looking forward to the years to come.
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year from all of us at CAVIRTEX.

In order to grow and innovate profits need to be made and reinvested. I don't think its that they are turning greedy. I think that they are realizing their fees are too low. In the age of social networking, where everything is free in return for all our data, people are now believing that things *should* be free or next to free.  But in the end i think the message is that it's easy to cut fee's; its much harder to raise.

@_date: 2014-05-12 02:49:20
Lobbying is essential. Paying tier-1 lobbying firms is not. The most important thing that everybody needs to realize is that politicians are people and for people to make educated decisions they need information.  This information leads to legislation/regulation. The Senators and Congressmen do not write these laws, the Lobbyists and lawyers do.  
Lobbyists bring information and legislation to politicians and bureaucrats on behalf of their clients. The clients are generally industry associations. Associations are funded by their members. 
 
Enter Bitcoin. At present time the Bitcoin Foundation is the closest thing we have to an organized industry association. It has the support of the Bitcoin business community and a huge roster of individual members. They/We should be writing the laws/regulations that we want to see, or not see, and be paying for them to be made law.
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:46:13
you think that tough try twitter...and I'm giving away $10+.  I kind of wish ChangeTip would cool it on the Bitcoin messaging and keep it to messages like "You Got Tipped!" As opposed to "You got Bitcoin." Tipping 1st, Bitcoin 2nd.

It's an 18-month study but it's likely the committee is breaking until session resumes in the fall. I'm really glad we were able to get in there before they suspended the hearing.  One thing is for certain, the senators were really happy we came and presented.  They are trying to understand Bitcoin and it's up to us as the Bitcoin community to give them proper information and lead them in the right direction so they can make informed recommendations. Want to get involved? [Send the senators a note with what you think.](

I personally love the fact that it's off-chain and you cant see how much is in your friends account.  This way you can use a single identity without worrying about using multiple addresses or being concerned about that.

the SDK is on github, the binaries are also available, should tangem the app dissapear there will be a way to sign a Tx from the card. 
we discuss it in this video.

Cyclebit.com is working on this right now. All any pos that had nfc would need to do is integrate the SDK and then it would be a tap and pay experience. We’re working on a wallet integration to make this experience for everyone. ����✨

Hey Poppa.
Her are some tips:
1. [Purse.io]( \-&gt; Amazon
2. [Cheapair.com]( \-&gt; Flights
3. [Swisskeycard.com]( \-&gt; NFC physical wallet / crypto bank note
4. [Bitrefill.com]( \-&gt; Gift Cards
5. At dinner. Get your friend to pay with fiat and you give them bitcoin.

Brutal. Sounds like they don’t see the full value prop.  Getting them to accept it would be great we just need to show them that it will net add value to their operations. 
Once  the POS integration is done these cards will make sending BTC as easy as tapping your credit card. The machines should also be able to take bitcoin directly via a request address. More options the better.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:54:25
Write down the 12 words on a card, note the value and date, and submit that to the pool...then help the recipient setup a wallet and sweep the key. ��
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:30:56
I suggest writing them down on the back of a piece of artwork or framed photo. This way you’ll remember where it is and you could leave a message to your family to open the frame. It’s better than using a journal or a random piece of paper. 
To further secure it you can do a basic multisig where (in the case of a 12 word mnemonic) you break it down into 3rds and write 8 words (1+2, 1+3, 2+3) on the back of three pieces photos and then keep one and give the other two to people you trust. This way it takes two of these places to recover your wallet. 
I also really like Edge wallet for mobile which uses a user name and password and has a password recovery feature that is secure.

Lol. I made bitcoin piggy banks back when BTC was a 1k. I dopped the project. I still believe in Bitcoin. I have a feeling your friend probably still believes in Bitcoin but the project wasn't working so he looked for a way out.  
It was probably a card but likely not "exact same" as these cards have some dope tech inside of them...

In order to just try out bitcoin I would recommend Edge Wallet. A hardware wallet is a like buying a safe. If you have large amounts of crypto then sure a ledger or Trevor make sense but for getting started it’s too complicated. 
I like edge wallet because it uses a user name and password vs a seed phrase and it supports many different tokens. 
My 2 cents. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:41:30
Once a person decides to choose bitcoin they will inevitably hodl and spend it. For those of us who really understand it it's easy to get more so make it easy for others to get in. Cheapair.com is a super strong use case that works and is easy.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:43:02
If 8 words are known how vulnerable is the seed? If you create a multi-sig then you lose the ability to operate the wallet functionally on a mobile device. I'm not talking about storing massive amounts of coin but giving noobs a tool that makes it a bit less scary while providing some redundancy. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:04:56
Agreed there are many that will / would laugh at you for suggesting this but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try for something. For companies with tight cash flow its pretty much impossible. For a funded operation, especially a bitcoin related venture, where your success will further drive adoption and price you could actually pay people at a discount with this structure.

You should take payment in bitcoin. If you are with a cash-heavy company that is open minded or if you are in a free-thinking funded startup (or somewhere In between) consider this. Work with your boss (if you have one) to take a % or all of your salary in bitcoin. (But not the bitwage convert x$ to yBTC at given market price model...) Lock it up for the duration of your contract and pay out bi-weekly or monthly. For example if you make 50k per year and you're on a two year contract see if your employer will take 100k, buy BTC and then put it in a 2-3 miltisg wallet. You hold one key, employer the other, and mutually decided 3rd party with the last. Every month you propose a 1BTC spend to your personal wallet and your employer approves it. You also don't have to take 100%. If OP  or someone else could automate and productize (Hackathon entry maybe?) this that would be  awesome. (I'm going to write a whole post on this in the days ahead) ��
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:55:52
I recommend edge wallet. It’s simple, secure,  mobile and supports many coins. You should be able to figure it out no problem.
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:45:23
To use crypto in daily life it makes sense to use a mobile wallet. I recommend Edge Wallet. You can also buy and exchange directly from within the wallet. Best of all, its supports doge coin...the copper to bitcoins gold.
@_date: 2019-09-23 04:56:49
I suggest you download edge wallet and simply sweep the private key into your wallet. It’s really easy and secure.

For an online store:
Love your products...but a small bit of feedback/request,  please add bitcoin as a checkout option; it's a no brainer. The fees are zero until you do a significant amount of volume,  it automatically can convert to USD, and it opens new markets while showing you want to be ahead of the curve vs behind it. 
If you want to talk more I'd be happy to help get you started.  
Sincerely, 
Ps.  Here is a Taco worth of Bitcoin (link a ChangeTip one time url) for fielding this request.

true micropayments can't function in this model. But i guess it depends on your definition of a micropayment. I would argue that it's anything less than a quarter. In an IoT and M2M world i think there is real play for true micropayments.

Great initiative! 
1) bring music 
2) I would recommend edge wallet - easiest non-custodial wallet setup bc no seed 
3) dm  me your address and I’ll send you some of my book which is a good primer and you can sell them for $ u/jimmysong you should send him some too 
4) sell/give small amounts of crypto to people and have them send it back...teaching people how to use it is essential...plus it will be hugely appreciated. 
5) if people are really interested in buying more then give them your shake pay link or guide them through the setup. 
6) I like giving people dogecoin...it’s a good copper to bitcoins gold; only way cuter
7) have fun! Don’t take yourself too seriously! Be respectful of the wealthy people but look them right in the eyes. 
8) stickers are great too as gifts and can also be sold. 
9) take pics with people

like sending money over twitter? on [paper airplanes]( Facebook? In monikers? I think it's sufficiently different and innovative. I paid for taco's in Austin using it by sending a tweet; no POS required, no paper, just two people with twitter accounts connected to their ChangeTip accounts. But Social payments are a whole new field that people barely understand and then throw Bitcoin in there and it becomes too much. ChangeTip should bury all Bitcoin references, by default fix a users account to a given currency (give them the option to be representational for the purists), and focus on marketing the social payments network. my 2 cents
@_date: 2015-09-01 23:51:30
disagree; one does not need to fund the platform provider to be considered a platform. ChangeTip is a platform that interacts with other platforms. ChangeTip is a becoming a money layer for social media and if it achieves this there are countless ways to monetize.  I would be careful before concluding about it's long-term viability. And yes there are many ways to monetize beyond selling data. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:30:37
ChangeTip is about social payments imo. They need to get more money into the system and get the average amount transacted to be much higher. I've used it for sending $100 plus to friends over SMS and that is hella convenient. Venmo isn't available outside USA and this is market that they can tap. They need to light a fire within a smaller community and demonstrate it's killer appiness. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 18:29:19

There are also other options for US citizens that don't have low buy/sell limits. At Coinsetter, once verified you can buy, sell and trade as you like. We are definitely not a wallet. In fact, we restrict bitcoin withdrawals to a single user defined bitcoin address to safeguard your account. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:24:26
Fantastic video David! Keep up the great work and keep channeling  that passion/power. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:45:34
agreed. This is why ChangeTip needs to have a robust API so people can develop their own apps that leverage the platform. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 14:28:36
ChangeTip is a perfect example of a company that can relieve some of the stress from the Bitcoin network by taking micro transactions and social payments off-chain.  I think may think that they have got the most from the bitcoin community it's lack of growth reflects their lack of growth. I would look in the mirror first and analyze the product...the offering is confusing to a new user; i sent my friend $20 at the bar using a one time tip-link and SMS and after signing-up/signing-in had no idea what to do and the site doesn't make it clear...it asked him to tip someone to get started...and there is an animated banana bouncing around next to a GIF moniker button... IMO, ChangeTip needs to get the hatchet out and start chopping off the fat on the product. Focus on balance, send &amp; receive. One-time tip links are amazing; leverage that. Tipworthy content...it's called reddit...do you want to be reddit or do want to be a disruptive social payment provider?
Also think about tipping and appreciation...yes the platform enables this but i'm not sure the world wants to tip everyone. I think people want to 1)send/recieve money fast 2)send/receive money with no/low fees 3) easily access it  4) use/withdraw the money (or at least know they can..this way they will keep the money in the system)...Venmo style 5) simplicity and clarity in product and UE.

At the end of the day the ChangeTip bot is listening for commands. When the bot hears you say something to it it scans your command looking for an amount. If you include a moniker it will pick it up. Commanding the bot has nothing to do with monikers, monikers are just another way of representing and amount.  send commenter props for asking a relevant question

you bring up a great point. I too was at SXSW when i told some of the artists that they could now accept "beers"/money over twitter their minds were blown. Think about it, how many times when you;re at a show would you be willing to buy the band a beer, a lot of people are shy, and sometimes the artists are just plain drunk, with ChangeTip is become soo easy.

Thank [Etye]( for the video. There was definitely an appetite for more info. The awareness levels are rising but still quite low. I think Bitcoin still needs to be easier to use if you expect the average undergrad to start using it; like Venmo. I think ChangeTip can challenge Venmo if they can sort out the fiat in and fiat out. Circle's app would also do well if they would get it together and come to Canada.

probably $1000 with a 10-25% acceptance rate. The paper airplanes were cool but not too many people knew what to do with a QR code and the one-time urls are not easy to manually input.

I'm confused. It is a bot in that when you mention there is a bot that listens and provides an automoted response/executes a transaction. This could definitely work on IRC if ChangeTip were to develop it for the specific platform or if a developer were to use the API to make an integration. If you wanted to send a tip over IRC that is not supported by ChangeTip then you could use a one-time tip link.

2) Education (Industry associations, government agencies, organizations)
3) Training (Work with universities and training companies to ensure we can meet demand for Blockchain developers &amp; designers)
4)Centers of Excellence (places for companies to gather, host events, collaborate with others, showcase solutions...I think of them as outposts for the Blockchain Supercluster.)
5)Standards &amp; Regulatory initiatives; we need to work with industry partners, regulators, governments, and international groups to ensure we don't stifle innovation through short sighted regs.

Thanks Kiran! 
1) Technically it's for companies, academics and non profits but I would recommend filling out a letter of support as an individual stating why you think this is a good initiative; it could be considered a philanthropic application...neat. 
2) use the technology, teach others about it, get involved in associations, build a company to seize the every expanding opportunities.

There are lots of options.  The one I recommend is you buy some more.  When someone gives you $1 its not the same as paying $20 and seeing your balance go up.  After you have some play around w it.  Use it to payback friends,  make donations,  say thank you etc; it's a pretty amazing platform and it opens eyes to the wonder of Bitcoin.  send this man $1
