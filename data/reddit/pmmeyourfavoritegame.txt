Everyone knows how to google. Apparently not everyone knows how to read though. If you're telling me your sources are the couple first google results I'm kind of worried about your critical thinking skills.

Dude, stop replying with "google" when people ask you for _your_ sources... Reading comprehension is not your strong suit, huh?

Dude, lose some weight. Your triple chin is showing.

Thank you very much.

Those god damn shrubs!

I definitely need to learn how they work. So who is right?

You could not convince a toddler with that abomination of a video.

Because cloud storage is magically immune to ransomware. This is such a bad idea on so many levels.

You should start smoking to kick the habit!

Most programmers can't convert hex in their head and you want everyone to do it? For the average person there's really no need or benefit.

Even such a conservative statement is giving prayer too much credit. There are very few studies regarding the efficacy of prayer and they don't look all that promising. Producing the same result as any other placebo is nothing to be proud of.

True, there's not much left of your 17$ if you send them via Bitcoin.

He means cooking meth.

Hm, yes, yes! You seem like an individual that's worth having a conversation with!

To be fair he did say "[...] you no longer have to spend money on it; it's just there as a gift for the rest of time."

I don't know. I kind of get where he's coming from. "I pray for you" has the exact same effect as "get well". Aside from the emotional support basically none.
As soon as people start to think they are actually helping by spewing forth a platitude, that's where most people have an issue with it. 
And it's usually the people that say "I pray for you" that fall in that camp. So I do kind of understand why most people roll their eyes when they here that phrase.

Which stands for Bitcoin Hash.
