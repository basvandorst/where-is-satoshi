I'm a poor college student who just sank a paycheck into this a week ago.  Who the fuck needs food?  HODL THE DOOR

Right?  I’m over here with like $250 in bitcoin like “-_______-“

I’m not a money expert, but I’m pretty sure if you own 100% of bitcoins the value would drop to absolute zero.  It’s the problem with any currency that doesn’t have physical material value: if any one person gets all of it, society’s just gonna shrug and move to a different one.

Any material currency like gold or diamonds are much more protected.  Even if one guy owns all the gold in the world, everyone else is still gonna want it.

Coinbase is probably the most popular and easy to use exchange.

I have a feeling you are much less important than you think you are.

For those who don't want to read the article, it's because firms have basically pegged the price of ice cream, keeping it at the same price relative to the US Dollar.  This works well for certain goods, and is HORRIFICALLY bad for currencies to do.  Pegging basically destroyed Argentina's economy in 2001, and so far only China has been able to sustain it at all because of their massive reserves.

Keeping ice cream at the same price relative to the U.S. dollar against normal price fluctuation is the definition of pegging. 
China hasn’t been hard pegging (i.e. setting a hard and fast exchange rate) but they’ve been doing a sort of soft peg for a while, using their massive reserves and trade practices to intentionally keep the price of the Yuan artificially low compared to the dollar.  Not Argentina level, who hard pegged, but still theoretically unsustainable.

About 2% of my income goes toward bitcoin.  Once I'm done paying off my credit card (3 more months at my current rate) it'll jump to around 8%.

You do realize that the amount of gold in Fort Knox is worth more than the entire bitcoin supply at it’s current value, right?  America isn’t running out of gold.

Dude quit it, you're fuckin up my portfolio.

How are you gonna keep the water and power running without fiat?

That's not exactly an option for a massive amount of people.  You can't just dig a well if you live in the middle of a city.  Bitcoin is great and all, and I believe it has a strong role to play in the future of economics, but the truth is the vast, vast majority of people cannot go without fiat anytime in the near future, possibly ever, especially if their government outlaws Bitcoin.  It just doesn't work that way.  They might be able to find ways to buy it discreetly, but the truth is unless a bunch of things change, people are gonna need a government-recognized currency for things like utilities, rent/house payments, education, etc.
