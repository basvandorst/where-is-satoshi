$400 swings in seconds is crazy to see. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:17:08
Lol sad get this outta here
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:41:44
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:23:12
Miners get rewarded for their work in bitcoin. Every now and again that reward is halved, so the miners get half as much bitcoin for their work.

Have you been making cash withdrawals off GDAX to your BOA account?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:10
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:26:28
Right? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:44:26
How do I transfer my bitcoin from my coinbase account to my gdax account?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:20:59
So true
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:35:42
Why can’t we honestly want both though? I want to be a millionaire in a world where everyone uses bitcoin as their primary currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:38:52
Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:29:41
I've seen your comments a few places on this thread about dope. Could you give a more detailed explanation? I've really never heard this theory and would love more info. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 15:54:33
If that we’re to actually happen something tells me paper money wouldn’t fair much better. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:27:06
Good one, I can tell you put a lot of thought into it. Keep posting about dope without any facts to back it up, I'm sure everyone takes your input seriously. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:35:41
Fuck off. If you don't want to answer fine but I don't need your paragraph on why you're a dick. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:22:03
Lame. Why bother replying at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:04:08
Whatever you say bud
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:47:26
Lol what
@_date: 2019-02-22 01:08:15
I don’t get the clue “hoodie”
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:26:48
Lol wtf
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:19:23
I love you Bitcoin. ❤️
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:40:07
I would probably take out a bunch of loans against high interest credit cards for some cash to buy btc if I were you
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:01:57
Seems like a no-brainer until bitcoin crashes back down to ~$5k. Risky business. I do wish you luck though! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:36:49
Exactly. Sheldon is r/iamverysmart embodied. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:50:12
That hype must be why a bitcoin costs $4k right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:49:02
Just wanted to vouch for this guy — I’ve been mining rvn since May and this is one of the bigger reasons why. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:53:40
No OP’s saying he’s an AMD shill
@_date: 2019-01-01 14:20:15
Sure, but then you’ve waited two days to make the purchase and the price isn’t where you wanted to pull the trigger. Pluses and minuses. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:46:12
Well done, bravo!
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:36:17

@_date: 2018-02-07 04:58:39
Damn. I have an eight month old son and didn’t realize I am a cryptodad too until you said that. Sheeeeitt. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:35:53
How the hell did you turn this into bashing on the left for a paragraph? Man...
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:24:26
@_date: 2018-02-26 04:33:05
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:28:30
Seriously what am I even looking at these axis don’t make sense to me
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:24:20
Oh please. It’s light hearted and fine. Plus anyone outside the community has no idea what any of this is about. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:02:38
Man we got bigger problems than memes to worry about. I  guarantee memes like this hardly affect anything at all. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:25:10
Sure. And if Bcash was at capacity then it would be vice versa. It isn’t inherently faster. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:13:44
LAM-BO. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:08:29
Oh man. Okay. You do you. I’m not gonna lose any sleep over this light hearted joke. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:17:48
I’ve never understood this argument. If a criminal held you at gunpoint, couldn’t he just ask for your private keys? I mean I get checking to see if a bitcoin account holds any value is clumsy and not plausible in such a situation in today’s world, but I’m talking more about the future, when bitcoin will be way more “user friendly.”  If anything it seems more dangerous, because there isn’t a fortified bank standing between the majority of your money and the criminal. 
Just an honest question I’ve never really wrapped my head around.

So then he holds up his phone with a QR code showing his public key, and says “send all your btc to this address now.” Assuming you’d have your phone on you with your wallet installed, because in this future btc is a common form of money used by many on a day-to-day basis, this seems like a reasonable possibility. 
I get having multiple wallets so he doesn’t get your life savings, but still.
