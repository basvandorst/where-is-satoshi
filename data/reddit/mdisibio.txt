Whoever down voted you is an idiot. That's exactly how earnings work.

I'm on my phone so I apologize for the quick links.   Basically, cryptanalysis of the algorithms finds fundamental flaws that reduce the number of hashes that need to be checked in order to create a desired collision.   Still brute forcing but much fewer possibilities.   I didn't realize these findings were that old already. I wonder what the state of the art is now.
I believe this is the original paper for the MD5 weakness:   Wang, et al:  [
Bruce Schneier's blog about a similar announcement for SHA-1.  [

Then why doesn't the post show up in the Top listing as I stated? It's score was over 2000 and was just posted yesterday.

Great analogy, but not exactly right.   MD5 has been broken to the point where purposeful hash collisions are in the realm of possibility.

Mind posting your screen shot?  I don't see it.

IIRC that was in a later edition.  Yes, from the wiki further down:
