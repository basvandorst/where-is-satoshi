Drowned a bunch of pigs too.

Oh, absolutely. There can be a lot wrong with GSDs and I made sure I got a reputable line. Thought it was worth sharing, that you can adopt a dog, and still get a pure-bred - talk to breeders.

This argument has never worked, the passages they cling on to, are right next to a bunch of other stuff that's trivial by today's standards that no one has a problem with.

as an aside, it's not a great conductor, there are cheaper and better conductors out there, gold doesn't corrode like other conductors, making it good for terminals.
It's inherent value, is literally that it's shiny - but that's actually useful.

Thanks to John Mcafee there's a show either way, I'm not sure exactly which result I'm hoping for.

He is a massive nerd. But I'm fairly certain he's not that technically minded.

Go have a look at 4chan.

not for interest though - you buy a stock, or any other investment, you may lose.

Better breeders offer rehoming. The contract on my GSD forbade me surrendering to anyone other than the breeder. When he went missing the breeder got his adult kids to come help search.

If my employer accepts bitcoin, and pays me in bitcoin how will the government know about it?

Anywhere I've worked where data security was a thing it's literally been a case of destroying the drive. It was a fun activity for the IT guys too.
Hard drives are cheap compared to reparations for data leaks.

No, but our money is plastic which would make the stamp less effective.

Cashed out at $300 because I hit financial problems - should have waited 12 months to pick a fight with HR :(

50 cents for a number? that's crazy talk.

Yeah - we don't have anything orbiting Earth at anywhere near the Moon's distance. It's not practical or useful.

Am I missing a story here?
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:54:28
Surely you knew it was a short-term endeavour, either Bitcoin would gain enough reputation to be accepted by Steam, or it would fall away and no one would care anymore?
This seems like the more positive of the outcomes - perhaps look into PSN/XBox live, as I'm sure their parent companies will take longer to catch up.

I really wish ChangeTip was a bigger thing.

My understanding of the Dev-Cycle at Valve, they'd probably take longer than a regular company - if the whole thing about their projects being voluntarily staffed is true. (the reason there is no HL3 is no one wants to work on it).

Not all of us have so much disposable income, I have a solid wage, but a family to support, $80 is not trivial.
That said, I have a solid wage, and a family to support - I've made the case that cashing in long-term is a fairly solid investment, and have made the commitment.

I HODL because I love avocado toast, and still want to own a house.

State budgets do not work the same way household budgets do. State debt is not the same as personal debt.

LOL @ bank grade security.
The shit I hear from developers I know at major banks, sometimes I think it'd be more secure storing your money on your front lawn.
They were equally shocked at the lengths we went to in education to lock down student information.

This is my strategy, I've allocated a budget, every pay cheque I cash in just a bit more.

I just screamed "cash in" at anyone who would listen.
