There's no field for response in my Charlie_Shrem account, but here's the message I just sent to whollyhemp from it (since I thought my alt account comment wasn't showing up either):




In case it isn't obvious by now, the claims are merely fabrications

I'm not I am Charlie Shrem. I am not even a moderator of So if you want to accuse someone, then accuse me.


To be honest, I thought the likelihood of a response would be low, and even then any response would likely only be a retort or private comment. I'm literally been laughing out loud these past few minutes at how much attention this has got.
I would point out to you that in my message I explicitly say I don't want money, so it's not really much of a scam is it now? And the only demand was to be satisfied *after* the supposed release of the first batch of information - which being a fabrication, could never have reached that point anyway.




I feel somewhat uneasy that this has blown up into such a big deal, because it's a pure fabrication and therefore a waste of people's time (mainly I feel bad for whollyhemp who has done the right thing), but I genuinely never expected it to go beyond the exchange of private messages (if even that!).

I would, but I'm banned here
You can pm my 'Charlie_Shrem' account to verify this is me
I was curious to see how the moderators would react to my message, though now I realize that perhaps I should have sent to ThePiachu rather than the mods as a whole - as Whollyhemp has been the first to react, pre-empting any (potential) corrupt behavior by other mods
