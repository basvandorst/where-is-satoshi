I believe it will correct similar to how it did in 2017. The current climb will reach a high of about $15k and fall back down to $10-11k for about a month before the climb begins again. That climb will last for the rest of the three months between then and late October. After reaching $50k, it will tumble down, again, similar to 2017.
Also, you're saying this rainbow chart is old because it was made a month ago when BTC was $6k? That's silly. I agree that it will correct, but I don't believe it's going to fall as hard. FOMO is already kicking in among normies, and it's like tinder for the people who are hesitant to buy.

I'm still watching the rainbow chart I linked as a guide. 'Maximum Bubble Territory' being at $100k is over a year away in September 2020. Based on the speed of the rally in 2017, I think 'Maximum Bubble Territory' will be reached before then, and the bubble will have to reinflate before it can pop at $100k. It would be a pleasant surprise, though.

The advice I follow is not buying or selling all at once. Buy in parts as it goes up and sell in parts as it comes down. Don't let the anxiety get to you, and definitely don't invest your life savings in it.
If you couldn't live without the money you're investing in bitcoin disappearing tomorrow, you probably shouldn't be investing it in something so volatile.

I think the main drive from the previous ATH to $50k will be the attraction to round numbers. The moms and pops that buy in between now and $50k are eyeing that sweet, round number. There is a possibility that the craze drives it to $60k or $70k before it ultimately falls again, but I don't think any ATH will be stable for months at a time.


You may be right in that the timeline for reaching the new ATH could be a few times longer than I predict. I still think the new ATH is within a year, and in that year there will be a month to a couple months of consistent dropping to high $9k/low $10k.
