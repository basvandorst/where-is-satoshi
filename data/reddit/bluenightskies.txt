You say men created everything, let’s look back in history, say 500 years ago. Where only men were allowed to pursue academics and women were expected to birth babies and stay at home. That was the psychology of people all around the world for a very long time and even still in some places women don’t get the luxury to go to school or even get jobs. Now if they don’t get the opportunity to learn the basics of how the world works, how do you expect them to create  these “things” you speak of????
Your logic wasn’t bad but there are more variables at play, if you only look at the sheer amount of things that have been invented by men then one can conclude men are superior in that aspect since women didn’t invent much but where you went wrong was that you didn’t think as to why women didn’t invent things? Maybe something was inhibiting them to doing such....
But the surprising thing is you didn’t look at the education system today, in basically any class men and women compete at the same rate and have the same average score as the opposite sex. They both have roughly the same iq. Some geniuses, some in the middle and some far below.
I read your comments further below and it sounds like you just believed what you want to believe because of the things that you have gone through and I don’t blame you, I might have done the same if I was in Your place. It’s can be hard to look at the big picture but always question why something is the way it is.
Anyway mate, best of luck to you.
