Yes, Bitcoin isn't volatile at all...

Stock market does not proportionally affect USD. The real estate market is not in a bubble and looks to be quite well insulated. Why would you move money out of fiat into Bitcoin (which is crazy stupid volatile) if you want to protect your money?

Just to be clear, the Federal Reserve is audited. What Ron Paul and Rand Paul want(ed) is "a more detailed audit."

If by retire you mean no more income from work (not investments) then yes 2M at 30 is too little.  It may be okay if you're 60 and your family only lives to 80, even then it's not that much (considering health care for elderly).
I've thought this through and no I'm not limited to "the urban experience".  I can live for much less than you can.  This person is speaking in terms of USD which limits him to a certain set cost.
There are ways to live for 60 years on 2M, I can certainly do that by moving back to my country of origin and living cheaply.  In this country, that's quite risky.  Unless future income is involved.
Have you thought it through?  Done the math?

Boundaries are healthy, but not the ones you're advocating.
Two things cause divorce, money and lack of intimacy (i.e. communication and trust).
Catch 22? No.  Do it.

I got in at around $14 (it's $28 right now) and that was yesterday.  Be careful, I probably only have 10% in alternate ecurrency.

If he's young 2M is not enough to retire on.  Not nearly enough.

If you're 30, inflation and medical bills (old age care is expensive) will kill you in the USA.  I live in one of those areas where you can get a "nice" house for not too much, I come from a country where it's quite cheap to live.  2M for someone who is 30 (or less), who can guarantee investment that beats inflation is still risky.  And no, real inflation is not 3%.  
Tell me, how much has your annual health insurance gone up in the past 5 years?  How much has food prices risen in the past 5 years?
3% is a manipulation.
It's hard to find stocks that pay a 3+% dividend (Intel comes to mind).
Bottomline, **do the math**.  2M is not enough for 60 years of life in the USA.
You are free to disagree.  But on what basis?
