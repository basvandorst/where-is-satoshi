So this is calculated by their volume i assume because clearly all that volume is real and they definently arent washing themself.

If you dont require to get the receiver to pickup at the store and just want to send to a bank acount you should definitely just use transferwise as they have the best rates and super low fees.

It's crazy, I remember a few years back there was a guy in the CBD with an ATM that I would buy from but had to close down because of all the stress with police that caused him to be raided quiet a bit. We've come so far I guess

Not everyone has an otc client and selling on an exchange wouldnt suffit cause of fluctuations high fees and withdrawal limits.

@_date: 2019-01-11 08:59:07
you do realize credit cards spend money you don't have right? and theres no interest if you pay on time. not even gonna bring up the volatility, but i guess its bad to have critical thought when talking about bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:50:24
Ok but if your making money illegally don’t be suprised to have it seized when u get caught.
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:46:55
Seized is the correct term as Silk Road was an illegal operation so the government was legally allowed to seize the btc...
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:25:00
