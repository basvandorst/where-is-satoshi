The blueray "syncing" might work, but that'd be really inconvenient :D
Can you say more about syncing from the UTXO set or give me a hint where to find info? It sounds like an alternative to full block download where only headers and a stream of UTXOs is downloaded, relying on checkpoints or "assumevalid" to make full blocks unnecessary? 
Is repeating most recent blocks already implemented or only planned? With 64kbits/s I'd assume it's only planned or implemented and disabled. If I remember correctly, the FAQ stated that bandwidth upgrades are planned, can you already say how much bandwidth is planned/expected?

Regarding the content of the post: Maybe I'm missing something, but how is disconnecting malicious nodes changing anything when your fully validating node had to connect to it before? The end result is the same, your node is not connected to the bad node. Your node is not isolating bad nodes from the network, the bad node is doing it by himself. Your node does not influence anything in the network by the act of disconnecting.

One of the downsides which is mentioned is very often the performance. I've prepared an article that shows a few possible optimizations which IMHO should allow BLS to compete with ECDSA based signature schemes. I'll post this article in a few days.

I've sent you a link to the article draft. Multiple optimizations are involved, all leveraging aggregation and aggregated verification. I'll publish this article in a few days.
