One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. 
Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

because 99.5% of the world never heard about bitcoin

3- Replace

i am running a node and it is easy. use an old computer, install btc core and open ports - done. 
hopefully i can run a LN node in the future. iam just waiting that more of the LN node stuff gets automated (channel management). in that case, i would run a node with a couple thousand bucks in it and with zero fees for users.
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:14:53


which leads to an infinite price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-26 18:01:53
i paid 0.001 cent for a LN transaction

they use the same fake argument all over the world.

This website ist owned by the former politician Roger Ver (people call him "Bitcoin Judas"). He is expanding his influence with this and is attacking bitcoin since years. He even wants to install a Bitcoin CEO and tries to centralize the development of bitcoin. In upvoting this crap, you are helping Roger Ver with his plans to form Bitcoin in a centralized Shitcoin and hurting your own investment in a free bitcoin. Roger Ver sold most of his bitcoins and now holds large amounts of Bcash which he tries to pump.
His website buys old reddit accounts to post this spam.

that does not have to be the case, as you say. "thin air" still holds.
i can take out a loan (as most people can) for 1000 USD and buy a tv, or burn it. the bank does not have the money, it creates money when it gives me the loan. (click the link)

@_date: 2019-06-07 17:13:24
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. 
Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

So if I keep a pending transaction with you for $0.01 when fees were dirt cheap, and now the fees are something wild like $3.50, I have a discounted transaction fee, so I could "sell" the liquidity for $3.25 and make a profit all while someone else happily routes through my channel for $0.25 cheaper. Rinse and repeat for people willing to do it for half, or even 1 cent below the standard transaction cost, and we have a free market emerge that slowly averages down the transaction fees over time as it becomes easier and easier to just do it all over lightning.

	To the untrained eye, several of the world’s top central banks appear to be rushing towards launching their own cryptocurrencies any day now.
There are many reasons why central bankers are intensely interested in the relatively new world of digital currencies, not least Facebook’s plan to launch one called Libra that has the potential to change the way money works.
And there are just as many reasons why these masters of the monetary universe, such as Mark Carney at the Bank of England and Christine Lagarde at the European Central Bank, want to convince commercial bankers they are close to creating their own version of Libra.
Yet, listen carefully to the central bankers, and it soon becomes apparent that all of this talk about launching their own cryptocurrencies is likely to be one big, elaborate bluff.
Ms Lagarde summed up this contradictory position this week when she told the European Parliament that central bank-issued digital currencies were “an area where we have to rush slowly”.
The new ECB president went on to explain: “There is clearly a demand and there is clearly a technology that would support it, but clearly there are also risks for the international monetary system and financial stability at large.”
There is no doubt that the idea of Libra, a digital currency that promises to make payments quicker, cheaper and easier for Facebook’s 2.4bn users, has been a serious wake-up call for central bankers. They worry about all kinds of risks, including its operational robustness, customer protection, money laundering, terrorism finance and data privacy.
But the biggest concern is that Libra has the potential to dilute the main power of central banks — to control the supply of money to the economy.
Benoît Cœuré, the ECB director who led the G7 working group on Libra and other asset backed “stablecoins”, has likened Facebook’s digital currency to an “elephant in the sandbox” — blowing away the “try it and see” approach used until now by regulators to examine nascent financial technology projects. Some politicians, like French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, have warned they could ban Libra.
Faced with such concerns, central banks are moving cautiously. Ms Lagarde said the ECB was conducting a joint research project called Stella with the Bank of Japan to examine the potential of digital currencies. Other central banks were further ahead with equivalent projects of their own, she noted, including Sweden’s Riksbank, the Swiss National Bank and the People’s Bank of China.
She even talked about the possibility of introducing a digital euro that gives every person in the eurozone direct access to an account at the ECB, describing how they could “use central bank money in their daily transactions”. This would mean a dramatic democratisation of access to central bank accounts, which have hitherto been limited to financial institutions.
Such a concept should make commercial bank bosses queasy. If it ever happened, it would mean that in the next financial crisis people could shift their money out of banks and into a digital currency backed by the central bank. A similar flight to safety occurred in the last crisis when stronger banks collected money withdrawn from weaker ones. Remember Northern Rock? And havens do not come much safer than central banks.
Mr Carney at the Bank of England went further in a speech in August by suggesting that a new “synthetic” currency issued by a network of central banks could potentially gradually replace the dominance of the US dollar in international transactions.
So what is going on here? ECB insiders say it has no laboratory working on a digital euro and little intention to create one any time soon. Most of these comments seem designed to jolt the private sector banks into improving the inefficient, costly and time-consuming world of cross-border payments.
Mr Cœuré recently praised an initiative by about 20 large European banks including BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank to create a new digital payments system — dubbed the Pan European Payment System Initiative, or Pepsi. The idea is to enable instant cashless payments through a European rival to ApplePay in the US and Alipay in China.
In the same speech, Mr Cœuré discussed the possibility of the ECB issuing its own digital currency, saying: “Potential central bank initiatives should not discourage or crowd out private market-led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area.”
For all the talk of central banks issuing digital currencies, many of them are secretly hoping the private sector will come up with solutions that make this unnecessary.
Now that the Pepsi project is becoming bogged down with competition authorities in Brussels for being too much of a closed shop, the key question is how long their patience will last.

Full node:
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

@_date: 2019-05-19 16:30:43
One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including "You received 10000000 BTC!"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.
