There is an argument for selling if you think it will go lower so you can buy and increase your holdings.

Please consider [Needy Meds]( who help by providing information on how to get medications more cheaply for patients in the United States. It provides links to coupons for patients with insurance, links to drug manufacturer programs that give certain patients free drugs from the manufacturer, and links to charitable foundations that may help pay for medications as well. And while you’re at it, you might also consider donating to some of those assistance foundations as well, though I’m less familiar with specific programs (otherwise, I’d totally give some suggestions).

As someone who had sold at 14K a few weeks ago when I was anticipating a bigger dip then, I was excited to get back in at these discount prices and end up with some more bitcoin.

Just commenting that I appreciate your username.
Finnegans Wake, WTF?!?! Indeed.

Hmm..The makes me wonder what bitcoin would be like in a parallel universe without computers. Presumably, certain precautions to make it unhackable by computer could be somewhat relaxed, meaning it wouldn’t have to take quite as long.

That one.  I will warn you that getting scammed is very possible, and at least 3 scammers PM’d me in the process. You’ve got to be very cautious, but it worked for me.

There’s a subreddit where you can sell gift cards for bitcoin, though you will generally get less than the card’s face value.

It worked out for you, but you should never risk money you can't afford to lose...and when you're taking out a loan, it's usually the case that you can't afford to lose it.

My but says it will go down further before it goes up, but we will see.
Edit:  GUT! I meant gut.

With as divisible as they are, many, many more than 21 million can own a fraction of one.

If you had a crystal ball you'd have sold at $5000 and bought at $3000 and have increased your holdings by 66%.

They'd probably make more money than at their day jobs.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:11:52
Let's say that you can *consistently* (and that's part of the catch, as others have pointed out) raise your holdings by 0.5% each day you go at it.  You have $1000.00 now.  At the end of your first day, you'd have $1005.00.  At the end of your second day, you'd have $1010.03.  Your third day, $1015.07, and by the end of your first week, $1040.70.  
So not a lot at first...but by the end of your first year, you'd have $6205.52.  A bump up, but not something to quit your day job over certainly.
At the end of year 2, you'd be up to a respectable $38316.96.
Year 3, $236,593
Year 4, you're a millionaire with $1,460,885
Year 5, $9,020,461
So it's possible it could be viable if the amount you can increase it in a given day is sufficient, and if you can do so consistently.  The trouble of course is that one wrong trade can set you far back.

Awesome! I'll go from $2 to $10!!
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:27:51
$3000 + ($3000 * 66%) = $3000 + $1980 = $4980
If you use the real value of 66.666666666666666...% you'll get 5000 (I should have used 67% as this is what the true number rounds to).

No, it means that if transaction fees were always so cheap, this wouldn't be news.

Burr, that's why we need it.

I got my bitcoin by selling a giftcard to someone on reddit.  I had to sell it at a discount and 3 people tried to scam me, but I managed to sell the card and got bitcoin for it.  Other people here may have better suggestions than this where you won't lose money by having to sell at a discount like I did.

Are you a bot that just replies with "or gay" to random comments? If so, that'd actually be pretty stupid, don't you think?

Actually 41%.

But if you sold at, say,  $4800 and bought at $3400 you'd have increased your holdings by 41%
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:33:12
As I've said elsewhere, sell $5000 buy $3000 would have been perfect timing.  What I proposed required much less tight of a window.
