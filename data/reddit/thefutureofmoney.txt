Why shouldn't Bitcoin rise? The mainstream media has been pumping it for the first time over the last 2-3 months. Exchanges are claiming hundreds of thousands of new users are joining their platforms every day, Japan has made it a mainstream national currency, everyone there is accepting it or investing in it. it is coming off a year where everybody made money, s it has all the momentum in the world.  
You think it should be falling?  You spreading that FUD?
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:58:16
The best way to get a company to change their wicked ways is to hit them in their pocketbook.  Don't appeal to their morality.  They don't know what that is. Kill their profits and you will kill their evil.
There are plenty of exchanges out there to choose from. Don't centralize yourself with a decentralized currency!

I can safely say, for the entire Bitcoin community, that we are all very proud of the work you do, for us, every day, Andreas. Bitcoin is very, very fortunate to have you on the right side of history.

Coinbase is undermining Bitcoin?  Man, I know I'm shocked......
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:17:22
Coinbase only cares about one thing:  Coinbase.
I worked on Wall Street for 4 years and they think just like any other bank. They live and thrive based on fees. Anyone who thinks a bank cares about any greater good, or any business ethics, is a dupe. 
Coinbase is a bank, preying upon its customers, who are generally noobs coming from the mainstream. They don't know any better, and when they do figure out that Coinbase is a low-life corporation, it will sully Bitcoin's reputation. This is called "rent-seeking behavior." They really see their clients as cows to be milked. Their actions speak this louder than any interview Brian ever does. 
Coinbase is an enemy to Bitcoin and all Bitcoin users, just like any bank is an enemy to any bank customer.  I've been on both sides. This is why I'm on the right side of history.  this is why I hodl.  This is why I use "The Future of Money."

In "The Shawshank Redemption," they called it being "institutionalized."  There was a time when you feared Bitcoin's volatility, but once you got inside, you started to expect it.  Now, we depend on it, for future growth. That's "institutionalized."

Hodling Bitcoins for 5-6 years without wasting them, losing them, or getting scammed for them is no small feat of mental strength.

When Segwit and LN hit Bitcoin adoption, a lot of these "faster" altcoins will quickly become obsolete, and fall like a stone. Bitcoin transaction volume is down for one reason:  Fees are too high and transactions take too long. When, not if LN solves this problem, what will the haters say then? 
When LN hits, you better cash out of your other positions in IOT, LTC and others. Their advantage will have been removed from the network, and BTC will take off, in volume and value. See the future.  BE the future!

This is if you ignore the fact that it grew 1429% last year, and has SegWit/Lightning Network coming in 2018, which will return the transaction fees back to pennies. Most altcoins and ICOs will require an investment in BTC, at some point, so it has built in investment demand on two fronts.
You assume that Bitcoin will not improve and this is a huge error on your part. 
Right now, Bitcoin is just the hottest mainstream investment on the market. What will be the problem when you can do millions of Bitcoin transactions per second off-chain, for pennies? Then what will the haters say?  All they'll be able to say is......how do I get started with this Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:01:35

The central banksters have a lot of power too, especially over the governments/regulators.  They can force you to pay them their tax slave money by their own version of Bitcoin, like they are doing right now in India.
Remember, ever politician needs money and central banksters have it and can get it to them, so the law will never be on The People's side.  If you are going to defend your right to use Bitcoin, you may have to put yourself on the line. 
Are you ready to meet that test? The test for your own financial freedom?

This is a logical business move by Visa and MC and should have been expected. Why should they help Bitcoin, essentially a direct competitor to their systems, adoption through their platforms? They aren't banning it, but profiting from it, which I don't have a problem with. The 3% lost will come out in spades, if you are smart enough to invest and hodl your BTC, or reinvest in altcoins that grow even faster.
Visa and MC are right to do this. Only people taking their fading fiat and investing in "The Future of Money" are much more so on the right side of history. That is a very wise investment that a mere 3% shouldn't stop. I only made 1400+% on my BTC last year.
My advice: Don't worry about the 3%. Think bigger than that, and you'll be just fine.

Only a few million people are using Bitcoin today. I think a few hundred million will use it 5-10 years from now. Who's gonna stop Bitcoin from growing?  What happens when Lightning network hits,
and Bitcoin can do millions of transactions around the world for pennines? It's selling for 415k and it isn't even a good currency right now. What happens when it serves as a great investment and a great digital currency?

When devs want to change the future direction of a coin, they cop the successful brand name, and its history, and then change the protocol rules, going forward to serve their purposes.

The new company is working with a marquee group of organizations including BCG, Microsoft, Starbucks, and others, to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a seamless global network."
"The Bakkt ecosystem is expected to include federally regulated markets and warehousing along with merchant and consumer applications. Its first use cases will be for trading and conversion of Bitcoin versus fiat currencies, as Bitcoin is today the most liquid digital currency. The effort is designed to address evolving needs in the estimated $270 billion digital asset marketplace."

Of course they're not going to mention Bitcoin.  They didn't want it's  negative image in the mainstream to impact the conference, and using blockchain gives the conference more mainstream appeal and they can build it bigger and attract more banks, institutional investors, etc. That doesn't mean this isn't the biggest Bitcoin conference. The biggest announcements this year, by Microsoft and Ledger HW were Bitcoin announcements, not blockchain.
This has been the top Bitcoin conference for the last 4 years, and their marketing to blockchain to build it doesn't change that one bit.

They aren't the problem.  The fact that they have little to no competition......that's a problem.
Companies don't get better until competition forces them to. That's what a free market society does. This will never change. It's called simple economics. Capitalism. 
When they get a competitor, you'll be amazed at how their fees drop and their service improves.

I've always been an advocate of "bits" for Bitcoin.  Make a millionth of a Bitcoin a "bit" of Bitcoin. Just like with paper currency, you need something the public can understand and latch onto that is smaller than the main unit.  You don't have a bitcoin, you have a "bit" of bitcoin.  Makes sense.
You have pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters.  if you're going to be a global currency, you need know quantities smaller than a Bitcoin, with names that make sense.

I've been saying this for months.  They used future's to hold Gold prices down for years and its come to Bitcoin. Gold was growing nicely every year before future hit that market.  Then it dropped from 2011 thru 2016.  The problem is not people so much as it is futures and dirivative trading. These practices are highly manipulative in the greater market, and in Bitcoin and Gold.
This price drop is not a coincidence......

Saying "Bitcoin is an investment" is not "wrong" as most people will use it that way.  You are probably using it as an investment, not a protocol. He's calling it like he sees it.

The central banksters have a much bigger problem in the digital currency space than Bitcoin to deal with in 2018. 
"The Petro" in Venezuela, backed by national oil reserves, inspired by Bitcoin, is being supported by Ethereum and Chinese blockchain technology experts, and may actually succeed, regardless of what the U.S. thinks or wants regarding their economic sanctions.  If Venezuela can work around U.S. sanctions this way, and profit quickly and easily from this new technology, many countries will follow suit in 2018, and the world will go digital currency over the next 1-2 years.
If this comes to pass, what will foreign nations need the U.S. dollar for, if every country can produce their own digital currency, and profit handsomely from the process.  If Venezuela succeeds, many will copy their blueprint.  The centralized banking system will surely fall by the end of the decade.

No one said Bitcoin was perfect, but it is clearly getting better every year, in tech, apps, and infrastructure, regardless of whether the price if $20k USD of $5k USD.  the price of  Bitcoin in USD is the least important part of the tech, but it is the easiest part to understand, so we all gravitate towards it.
It was a great investment last year at $965 USD and nothing has changed except it has more tech, more media attentian, and is worth 8X as much.
If the banks aren't that bothered then they wouldn't have colluded with each other last week to stop credit card purchases of Bitcoin. If it wasn't relevant, they would have continued to ignore it, so I don't know what you are talking about.

So he hodls the 20 BTC, and they are worth let's say $1 million before he graduates, but he understands risk analysis. Now, all he has to do is get a job paying $1 million a year, for the rest of his life, and he breaks even.
For you to defend his "investment" in NYU, you also have to support the idea that Bitcoin WILL collapse, somehow.  You are either trolling Bitcoin, or you think he will do better knowing risk analysis than having one million USD of an asset at age 22?
Show me a scenario where he graduates at 22 and he is doing better than $1 million thanks to NYU? You don't see how him hodling Bitcoin and other altcoin, plus running his own businesses in crytpo currency, without NYU, are teaching him more about "risk analysis" than anything NYU can give him?  And he doesn't have to waste 4 years doing it?  You are trying to miss that point?
If hodling Bitcoin doesn't teach you about risk analysis, nothing will!  And that education doesn't cost $200k, or 4 years of your life.

I'll mistype and you can waste thousands of dollars.
Good luck with that.

Should say "According to five jabronis we found loitering in the lobby."
That's about the same intellectual value you are getting out of them.
Calling them "experts" undermines CNBC's credibility.

That doesn't make any sense at all. 
What are the chances that every person hodling BTC never sells?  That's 0%
If the market contracts, and a lot of BTC is not on the market, then the few that hit the market skyrocket in value.
Bitcoin is a lot more than just a speculative investment. People will actually use it as a way to send money too, whether its a few Satoshis or to pay for a job on the other side of the world in seconds.  
You see the dark side.  I see the Future of Money.

By that logic, he could've gotten those benefits from a college education that cost $20k for 4 years, not $200k.  
Show me how a four-year $200k college education is more valuable than the 15-20 BTC that will be worth 3-5X that much by next year?

No. The fake news tells you what they want you to believe. 
The only question is are you falling for their propaganda?

I know a dozen people in Florida, where I live, who don't need the grid for jack!  
So if you can't get it done, own it, Son!  That's your problem, not mine.

This is great news for smart people who buy the market dips. 
More BTC for me!

This may be a blessing in disguise. If India, and China, force people out of banks, and to stay in Bitcoin only, that would accelerate the growth of Bitcoin currency transactions going mainstream, as people can't come out of the digital currency and back into fiat. Their plan of attack on Bitcoin may actually accelerate Bitcoin's growth as "The Future of Money!"

Yes, I am a genius, because I know you don't need the grid to store enough energy during the day to run your electronics at night. Plenty of people store the overcharge energy and never need the grid. Depends on where you set up and your system efficiencies.  If you are smart, like me, no problem.  You would struggle....

I have BTC hitting $1M by 2025.  
BTW, this takes into account the lose of value of the USD over the next 7 years. The USD loses value every single year.

They won't all be released until 2140, so you undermine your own point.
Besides that, you seem to be trolling here, just to do so. You don't seem to know much about its use cases and value proposition, and I don't have time to educate you, so I'll ignore you. 
Think whatever you want, but you are off. Bitcoin is a useful currency and a valuable digital asset. It is not A or B.

I use the BitPay debit card.  It is a great card, with high limits, and it works in the U.S. and can be received in the U.S., a rarity.  Currently, there seem to be very few, if any options for Bitcoin debit cards in the U.S. due to regulations.  If you know of any other options, pass them along, but I've used the BitPay debit card for over 2 years with no real problems. This new protocol is really the first problem I've ever had with BitPay.

You can see the fake news spin, if you look carefully.
See how they framed it against Bitcoin:  "Despite the optimistic comments of SEC commissioner Pierce, the price of Bitcoin dropped by more than 4% within a one-hour period....."
This is fake news.  Here's what actually happened:  The SEC rejected the ETF, dropping BTC price.  Then, Pierce defends BTC, and supports the ETF, which caused Bitcoin price to rebound nicely to previous levels.
The fake news tries to be slick, but I'm old as %$ and know their game before they play it. 
Now back to your regularly scheduled programming, heavy on the programming.....

Looks like Bitcoin is about to get a heaping dose of good mainstream publicity on its ever increasing value.
There is no such thing as bad publicity, and this can only help Bitcoin attract more mainstream investors.
They won't make tens of thousands of % on their money over, but they'll do much better than anything else out there.

A classic newbie investor buys high and sells low.  The smarter investors are buying BTC right now.
Hopefully, you don't bail, and you get your net worth back in 2019.
