If you are planning on receiving a 10k wiretransfer from coinbase, be prepared to claim it on your taxes as a capitol gains with proper documentation (and a 30% tax rate if this year, or 15% if more than a year)
There are other ways around this, some include local bitcoin face to face transactions (which even if you get a lower exchange rate, cash is cash).

On payday, I have coinbase buy a specific USD amount at current btc.

Beyond doing what you are (regular bitcoin buy on payday for set USD amount, I am also using bitcoin online and in the wild when possible, but purchase that value in btc at the same time.  SO if I spend $25 dollars on coffee beans using btc I go to coinbase and buy $25 dollars worth.  (or a tad more if I feel good).

Well. it depends on why I want it liquid.  If possible I would try to find a way to reinvest those funds back into the same "business" that they came out of.  And if you are making thousands of dollars on trades, I hope it's your "business" that is investing and not you. The extra layer can help you write up more items.   
I originally mentioned that I would sell face to face to go from BTC to USD CASH not to USD in a bank account.  You can always claim cash on your taxes, but I dont' want my bank to report it for me.  
For the record (since all internet statements are for the record) I have a trusted accountant who signs off on my taxes.  The nice thing about him is that he is creative but honest about the system.  He is actually willing to save me money (vs a lot of big box accountants who just want quick work, secure, no risk on there part).

This is why I kept my credit union even though it is 3 states away now.  They look at what the members want, and mine is educator based... so it is probitcoin.

I prefer to structure the way I manage money in a fashion that takes full advantage of the financial system.  Playing by the rules only works if you know all the rules. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:14:57
I totally agree. 
what I have found I like BEST about bitcoin (and coinbase as a means to buy) is that I am EXCITED to save money and put it aside.

When I was 22, I had that much of my wealth in high risk investments.... I am 29 now and wish I had been a "tad" more cautious.    Invest just as much in the safety net that will catch you if you fall.
All that said.. I am investing heavily in Bitcoin.. but if it DOES crash I will lose potential wealth not safety.

I realize that it is part of your income. what I am saying is that simply having it in cash, does not mean you can't report it.  I guess part of why I use bitcoin is the same reason I prefer to use cash. It leaves the accountability up to me, instead of being imposed on me.
