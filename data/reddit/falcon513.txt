I usually use the mobile app or typing directly. I've changed passwords and I can't at this moment but very soon I will transfer them to a paper wallet.

point taken. I've been meaning to look into it. Also, the link is not working for me.

Oh ok thank you for the clarification. I did not make any transactions at all yesterday, so I don't know about the other output. I'm wondering if they were stolen or where they were sent to.

My wallet had 0.87 BTC yesterday morning but last night it had 0.76 even though I didn't make any transactions yesterday. A transaction sending 0.089 BTC was made yesterday, but I didn't do that. I'm not sure what you mean by change, but nothing came back to my wallet.

So is it safe to import wallet seeds into a BCH (BCC? still lost for that) wallet? Like Coinomi?

I have my seed phrase, so I'm set right? Will I have the option to move my coins as BTC after today?

Thank you for your replies. I didn't buy BTC for the purpose of making money as one would buy stocks; it was mainly because I think it's a cool idea and I want to be a part of it. At the same time I don't like seeing BTC drop because that's money going down the drain. Does that make sense? Anyway I am rather excited/curious to see what will happen later in the week.

So.. I just bought Bitcoin for the first time yesterday and to be honest I am panicking a little bit cause at this point I'm losing money. Should I be worried?
