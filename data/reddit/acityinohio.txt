Thanks so much for choosing BlockCypher! Always makes me smile to hear about more developers building their products with us. :D
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:51:33
That's a great point. If the original proposal goes through, it probably wouldn't work as stated...however, if some modification of it/aspects of it become part of the consensus protocol, it would be possible to modify it accordingly, per [BlockCypher's co-founder/CTO from this same thread.](
If the consensus method does modify to a lesser degree, I will happily write another article outlining our new model, of course. And what you mention about replacement would be valid in computing confidence in some implementations of replace-by-fee too.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:47:34
That's a great question---ultimately, in its current form, this would be incompatible with original replace by fee proposal, but there are cases/other modifications of the proposal where it would still be valid, to echo the sentiments of [BlockCypher's co-founder/CTO from this same thread.](

This is really great y'all! Having just moved to SF I'm very excited that I seem to be surrounded by bitcoin companies.
Have you ever thought about offering companies listed the ability to add tipping addresses? I think it'd be pretty cool to support a company for supporting bitcoin...although I imagine proving valid ownership would be difficult. (maybe something akin to what keybase does with a "proof" on a user's website?) Either way, thanks for all the hard work here, I love being able to support crypto-loving businesses!

Thanks so much for the vote of confidence Erik! I just joined a few weeks ago, and while I'm already (understandably) biased, I can say that this perfectly reflects my own internal view of the company. The team is incredible, and everyone here goes the extra mile to help our customers build their products. 
And on a broader strategic note, my view is: the better we can provide infrastructure, the more developers will build on block chains, the more diverse the cryptocurrency community will be, and the more widely accepted cryptocurrency will become. It feels great to be part of that positive cycle.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:09:35
That's a really interesting idea! At the moment, we already guarantee all transactions delivered through our [Microtransaction API]( We may eventually consider the idea of bundling automated insurance for broader transaction ranges, although we haven't seen much demand for something like that yet. Still, definitely something to think about in the future.
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:04:40
Thanks for response and I'll clarify a bit more about the [Microtransaction API]( for your benefit After the first 8,000 transactions (and even during) we compute the absolute minimum transaction fee that we think will be accepted into the next block. This is both to minimize our fees for the first 8,000 transactions, and to minimize the cost to you thereafter.
While it's hard to determine what those fees will be before the transaction is created, we do try to minimize them. If you want to see what those fees will be before sending a microtransaction, you can opt for the two-step, client-side signing of your microtransactions, whereupon after you call the API once with your public (instead of private) key we'll send a partially filled out Microtransaction that shows the computed fee (along with data you need to sign on the client side).
Feel free to email me directly if you need more details: josh [at] blockcypher [dot] com . I've also written some new documentation that I hope will be up on our website within the next week, so be on the lookout for that soon.
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:12:31
Ahh sorry, I was throwing around "consensus" with a bit too much abandon (a dangerous thing when talking bitcoin, heh). You're right, that won't affect libconsensus; I meant to say whether a large number of miners reach consensus on tx replace-by-fee (aka a majority of them accept those replace-by-fee patches). So far we haven't seen the (minimal) uptake materially affect our model, but if we do we'd absolutely modify accordingly and publically walk through our changes too.
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:56:43

As someone who loves both bitcoin and tea, I'm a big fan of what you guys are doing.
One quick question though: I'd love to try some of your tea, but I don't necessarily want to make (yet another) account online. One great potential advantage of bitcoin (in my mind) is that it has the power to simplify the entire purchasing process online. I know this is a bit of a tall order, but I'd love to be able to buy your tea by simply entering an address and sending you BTC.
I could be alone here, in which case I'll stop whining. ;) But I think simplifying the purchasing UX might lead to more BTC-related business.
Either way, very cool to see what you're doing, and keep at it!
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:58:58

BlockCypher's Developer Advocate here; saw this post on our company's Slack channel and felt like chiming in. :) 
Anytime you want to do on-chain, small payments for which we will pay mining fees (for the first 8,000 transactions). We also guarantee the value will be transferred, as long as you wait for it to reach 98% confidence through our [Zero Confirmation Confidence factor.]( This typically takes around 8 seconds, far quicker than a single block confirmation.
 is the most prominent example of someone using it in a largescale way, but I promise there are others. Let me know if you have any questions, either here or at my email: josh [at] blockcypher [dot] com .
I'm also in the process of writing a longer blog post about how our Zero Confirmation Confidence factor works---which is also used by [Streamium]( and [Shapeshift]( and provides the basis for our own Microtransaction API.
@_date: 2014-07-06 11:05:41
Not t'all! My favorite was definitely an IPA called Falcon Smash (was close to Imperial in terms of ABV and had nice citrus undertones alongside massive hops). Also had a Scottish ale, a red ale of sorts, and strong pale ale. It was delicious --- definitely worth a trip if you find yourself in the RVA.

BlockCypher's Developer Advocate here. We just rolled out HD wallet support in our API, which you can [read about here]( Not quite the same interface as a web-based block explorer, although with cURL and some piping you can do some neat stuff.
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:04:06
I see your point, and that's a fair critique of folks using 0-confs for wildly inappropriate use-cases; e.g., I wouldn't sell a car without at least a few confirmations.
But with enough players providing risk mitigation services (ours included) and customers using appropriate levels of risk, I believe that concern can be greatly mitigated. On the flip side, I'd really hate to tell my unbelieving friends that it's the payment platform of the future at a bitcoin-accepting coffee shop, only to have them wait ~10 minutes to get their cup o' joe.

Well, better that than the "double secret probation consensus" rules.
@_date: 2015-07-17 05:19:38
Those are certainly legitimate strategies, and I'm hopeful for Lightning Network as well.
But dozens of satisfied Confidence Factor users would categorically disagree with you there. Its practicality has been forged in the crucible of the market, and with every new double-spend attack vector it becomes stronger.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:32:41
Having just yelled "cup of coffee!" I find that it doesn't enhance my ability to ignore anything, but maybe I'm doing it wrong?
...no, but really, I draw the "car vs coffee" distinction because it's the easiest dichotomy to strike, but as you allude to, there's a broader risk spectrum. With enough sales volume, the risk is manageable, whether it's coffee or PlayStations or cars. However, if you're only selling one $300 item a day, you might want to be more careful. That said, it's all dependent on your business. 
As an aside, I'm pretty sure that many "physical store double-spend" security systems will rely on IRL security, like, security cameras, police reports, and what have you, and they'll wind up being a pretty strong disincentive to double-spend. Not sure there are many black hats who are also shoplifters.
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:56:42
For having a decentralized, distributed, pseudonymous accounting ledger? Nothing we're doing here is counter to that; everyone at BlockCypher is committed to furthering the goals behind Bitcoin. We are downright passionate about it, you can ask any developers who work with us.
If anything, our risk assessment strategy is **leagues** ahead of what existing payment infrastructure uses, from a privacy perspective. They rely on credit history and personal information; all we look at are transaction propagation and structure, which you [can read more about here](
Everything we do and use is publicly available, via any blockchain explorer---because everything we do is on-chain. We're completely transparent, and even these Confidence Factors can be tested via our API if you feel so inclined. Many companies use us in tandem with bitcoind or their own local bitcoin daemon, and we encourage that.

I've been saying this to a number of a friends for a while now: I think kids are one of the next great usecases for bitcoin. They're perennially underbanked, but have the will/desire to engage in commerce online, and the technology/infrastructure to do it too. Will become especially more critical as games start using bitcoin for in-game currency (which is an awesome trend).
Anyone who makes a kid-friendly wallet/service with some parental tie-in (maybe with a weekly allowance feature? 2-of-2 multisig for approved purchases?) is going to be doing the ecosystem a huge favor. I'm a little busy as BlockCypher's Developer Advocate, but if anyone goes down this road and needs help please let me know.
@_date: 2015-07-17 05:50:36
Luckily, the data that goes into our Confidence Factor is completely open and accessible to the world. It's called "the bitcoin network," and with a few well-tuned nodes, you can build your own version of it. We welcome competition, and happy to see other strategies like GreenAddress, payment channels, and (hopefully eventually) the Lightning Network. Alternatives help ecosystems thrive.
Regarding your second question, our Co-Founder/CTO [has an articulate response via the bitcoin-dev mailing list.](
In short, no, for the (broken-sounding) record, we are not Sybill attacking the network, nor have we ever been, nor will we ever. I don't know where you're getting your information about Sybill attacks, pseudonymous identity that has [existed for a single day]( but I have to assume your source of information on it is likely being [Sybill attacked.](
The irony that this particular claim is coming from a [sockpuppet]( is not lost on me. How long have you been Sybil attacking reddit on an industrial scale, "Alexi?" :)
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:34:01
OP here. Of the 102,000 double-spend attempts, only 11 were against transactions with at least 90% confidence (and the rest were against lower confidence transactions). In that same time frame, the **vast majority** of transactions above 90%+ confidence had NO double-spend attempts (in fact, much larger than 90%).
Apologies if this was unclear, but we were trying to convey that our Confidence Factor does a very, very good job of predicting transactions that are likely to have double-spend attempts.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:57:37
Of course! Just trying to give our developers what they need to build great bitcoin applications, and if we can use that data to help the bitcoin community at large, well, why not, you know? :) And thanks for the tip!

Author here, you can check via [Keybase]( or [Onename](
Don't mean to antagonize here, as I think many in the bitcoin community want the same things, but I feel like I ought to protect my credibility by responding. But in the spirit of the article and as a friendly retort, I'm going to do it with the helpful aid of Princess Bride references. 


[To paraphrase Vizzini:]( Never go in against a Calabrian (my ancestral home, not quite Sicily but close) when his credibility is on the line!


To paraphrase Vizzini a great deal further: *citation needed*. I did [such a search]( and the first link is a self-post by [you, speculating, and with no official response from the Coinwallet folks]( Their prior June stress tests were announced, you can look at the following links in that search, or just [look at their user account here.]( If you can find me an official statement from claiming responsibility for the attack *last week* I'd yield and update my article accordingly. Although I think the likelihood of finding one is quite [INCONCEIVABLE.](
Beyond their own lack of admission, you can ask anyone in the bitcoin infrastructure space, and they'll tell you that the June "stress tests" versus the July attack were fundamentally different, both in strategy and magnitude. Look at [this graph]( which I generated from awesome site; you can make it yourself at [statoshi.info]( The June stress tests were barely a blip on TPS, compared to July. Moreover, beyond simple TPS numbers, the Coinwallet.eu stress test was straightforward and constant; the July attack had varying volumes of transactions, varied inputs/outputs, varied transaction sizes...more varied everything, and much more sophsiticated in execution and scale.


I'm with you there, whether it's a test or an attack, we all wind up improving. Like [mawage, consensus is what briiiings us together.](
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:31:30
Thanks! And got you covered there too. :) If you look at the unconfirmed transaction list [here]( you'll see a field called "miner preference." "High," "medium," and "low" correspond to those estimates; e.g., with "high" preference you can expect the transaction to be included in the next 1-2 blocks, wih "medium" within 3-6 blocks, and with "low" 7+ blocks (although depending on TX volume the inclusion in the block might vary).

Part of judging a transaction is not just whether a double-spend will succeed, but whether *a double-spend will even be attempted.* If you're a PoS vendor and you see a 90% Confidence Factor, it's not just incorporating the likelihood of a successful double-spend, it's also considering whether it will be likely for a double-spend to even be attempted in the first place. [You can read more detail about the methodology in an older post of mine.](

@_date: 2015-02-01 01:43:55
Agreed. I think said it best on Twitter recently (and full disclosure, I'm paraphrasing here): all forms of money carry risk. To imagine otherwise is to become a sucker.
So then it becomes a question of what kind of risk you want to carry. In the long run, I prefer the risk profile of money backed up by cryptography, open-source methodology, and a decentralized, PoW-based, predictably limited monetary supply. It's a risk that, as a techie, I can understand and accept more readily.
The risk that other currencies carry are downright frightening by comparison, but are masked by the sheer *scale* of the systems/users that support them...until something in the system breaks. It's much harder to explain the hidden risks to people at large, and I think it's one of the areas where bitcoin runs into adoption problems. But I think it will overcome them.
