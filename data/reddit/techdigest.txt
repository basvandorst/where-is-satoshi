The big point here is being missed, Telegram has 65m users who can now buy Bitcoin through the app and easily convert their Telgram messenger to Getgems and still connect to all their old contacts. telegram being open source in the end will win. Telgram is a great fast app, no reason to find another messenger app if you are into bitcoin. Connecting social networks in an open source way is the future.

No free money for you!

Plus gave 900 gems bonus for making the move, that's about $20 at present prices. Poor you having to change a password for $20.

Of course your wallet is separate to the security of the apps messaging element. I guess security wise Telgram is seen as an encrypted secure app. Even if it wasn't the best your wallet is protected by other means.

The intrinsic value of Bitcoin the currency is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin the blockchain. It's like saying there is no value in roads or railway lines. Plus yes in some ways Bitcoin is fiat like,  it the biggie is that it has a limited supply, something fiat never has. It's what makes Bitcoin a kind of virtual Gold. Without limited supply Bitcoin would be BS.

Your wallet is decentralised and can be accessed through counterparty and I believe hive, you have an offline wallet and an online wallet, think of one as your actual wallet and one as your bank.  there are elements of the apps function that must be decentralised like the coming airdrop.

You answered your own question, the last innovation misses the next. So the last innovation on your list has completely missed Bitcoin. Whatsapp, snapchat etc could of put a Bitcoin wallet in their apps, created a store and even an alt to reward users....it would of been so easy. Basically what Getgems have done.

I was talking about Ryan's comment. yeah I heard referrals will be paid retroactively so while they aren't 'working' they really are working.

Whisper has a lot of question marks over it. The fact is Snowden in some ways undermined it by recommending it, it put a target on its back. Telgram has a large prize if anyone can hack it, No one has, if you don't think it's secure then please go get that prize if it's soooo easy.

The app is in beta..

If you're going to make up lies make up plausible ones.

Apples to Oranges. Gemz is not some social media platform that hoped to promote Bitcoin. It IS Bitcoin and an alt. I'm guessing you never used it or read the white paper.

You can send 1000 BTC as a text message in an instant IF you got it...

most chat apps had a slow early build up. It will start to snowball once you get to around 50,000-100,000. the viral elements of the app have only just started to be implemented. The airdrop the big one is yet to start.

You know you are in the Bitcoin section of Reddit, right?
Anyway,  you are doing something, you will be paid the potential money that Zuckerberg gets from your info. In that sense it's actually a more tangible economy than Bitcoin cause real money/value from advertisers will come into the system.

viber is nice, great if it gets a Bitcoin wallet and learns from Getgems how to send coins in an easy way. Getgems is more a self rewarding social network that Viber with Bitcoin could never do. I expect Viber will be used to make paymnets to Raketuen. There is plenty of room in this market..
@_date: 2015-07-25 05:22:03
Plus Gemz actual vision is decentralised social, ie advertisers sell IF  you let them to you directly and not to friken Zuckerberg. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 02:57:11
65 million people, hardly anyone...right?
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:50:07
Really? Didn't Getgems just answer all the fears you seemed concerned about? And explained fully with perfect logic to why they are holding back OS till a quality check is done. What do you want their first born babies?
Telegram are clearly happy about the project as the CEO tweeted about a feature it developed a few days ago....some people are idiots on here.
