Would someone be able to link me to the percentages of bitcoin held by certain individual accounts? I remember there being a graph once showing like 1btc is so and so percent 1-10 Btc is so and so percent and so on?

I get where you are coming from and that's your opinion and you are entitled to it. 
Buuuut you have to admit public interest in bitcoins has grown more and more every day and as bitcoins are no longer created what do you think will happen to the price? Basic supply and demand problem.
Not all of us want to cash out, what if bitcoin becomes the normal worldwide currency? I wouldn't need to cash out. 
Yes it is a speculative investment but with how fast technology is moving do you really think in 10 years time we will still be using paper money and waiting 3-5 days for our banks to process our payments? 
Do you like the idea that you could work 1 hour today for $20 and put it into savings and one day that whole hour you worked can't even buy you a loaf of bread? Inflation is fucked. I'm 22 and I can see that the system we live in isn't sustainable forever, something has to change.

Bitcoin is not inflationary like the dollar.
Cryptocurrency's in general fix a lot of problems we have with the current systems (monetary and plenty of others).
The paper that money is printed on only has "value" because we give it "worth" value, like bitcoin.
Bitcoin is boarder-less, therefore if I travel from one country to another I don't have to worry about converting my USD to EURO I can just spend my bitcoins and it will automatically send the required amount on the price tag just in bitcoins.
Bitcoin may be in a bubble and it may pop but look back to when bitcoin was in a bubble at ~$1200 and it popped to ~$300. Then see where bitcoin is now. I wish I bought more during that "bubble"

Those feelings all go away after a while, you have just been put out of your comfort zone and you don't like it because it's not going your way. Markets will never just go up they have to go both ways. Most I've been down is about 5k was a hard time but I believed it had a lot of upside in the future. crypto isn't going anywhere.
"Don't invest more than you are willing to lose"
Ever heard that one? I'm 22 and have all my money in cryptos. I don't give a fuck if it all goes to 0 life is all about experiences NOT money, and the experience of crypto is fucking amazing. 
Keep your mind off it by studying about how cryptocurrencys can fix a lot of problems we have today

I also have an addictive personality lost $36,000 trading. The worst part is the “potential profits” the $36,000 could have made me in the future. 
Lesson learnt.

That’s like saying the internet let’s bad websites up that can be hacked? Is it the internet’s problem a site can be hacked and potentially have money stolen? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:07:30
Market Physiology. They want you to think it will keep going up forever while they sell into you.
Have a look at bitcoin it’s been going in a bullish channel for a while now do you really think we will never see another bear market again?
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:24:32
Yeah I’ve learnt my lesson. Next bull run I’m taking profits on the way up, if it falls then I can buy back in but if it doesn’t I can sleep well knowing I’ve made a tidy % profit.
Thing is if I continue to invest this way soon enough there will be times when I take profits at good points relative to the indicators and make extra money. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:04:01
If you think bitcoin won’t have a major bust period again I think you’re in for a rude shock.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:18:04
And what about all the websites that have been hacked since the beginning of the internet? Should they contact the CEO of the internet and as for their money back? Lol
This is growing pains for ethereum and the developers creating things on top of the platform, just like the internet still has problems with developers creating things on the internet. Nothing can be perfect strait away you have  to have problems to be able to learn and make a product better.

I was pretty angry with myself for making the 8 or so trades. Every trade had a goal and I read the market well what I didn’t do well was handle my emotions and fomo back in, then the price dropped to my projected buy back price.
Took me about two days to get over each bad trade but I analysed my mistakes and I know I’ll have an opportunity to make it back in the future, the biggest mistake is trying to rush back into “finding a trade” to make your money back, you don’t make trades you wait for them. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:44:45
So you are saying we shouldn’t try? Because we will just make mistakes what’s the point hey?
These are just the disadvantages of being an “early adopter” to the tech. If you don’t like it come back when we are stable and the market cap is massive.
Can’t have the high rewards without the high risk.

“Goldman Sachs expert” so not Goldman Sachs directly I suppose but don’t you think a Goldman Sachs expert would still use GS trading techniques if he was personally investing in bitcoin himself given his high status? I mean is worked enough to get an article and a lot of views on reddit

Btcmarkets is probably your best option for fees, spread and usability. The team behind it is very fast to help with any problems. 
If you want to buy a smaller amount you can use coinbase with your credit card and it works out to be a little bit cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:42:45
Works out to be about the same. Btcmarkets you pay a premium and independent reserve is even worse.
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:43:24
Cheaper to go through coinbase you get a cheaper price most the time even with the fees on top.

Any publicity is good publicity. Smart people will see the % gains it has made and be attracted to it doing their own research and probably start investing

Markets generally like to follow previous patterns. He/she is saying last time bitcoin acted in this manner it was followed by a drop in price.
