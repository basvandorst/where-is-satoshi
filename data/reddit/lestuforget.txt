That does not matter. You cannot do any harm to Garza, just keep on writing troll comments to vend your frustration. He is powerful man busy making money and here you are trying to scratch his ass as if it gives you peace of mind.

How is it relevant here? Looks like you are some butthurt guy who keeps on shitting in every thread about Garza. Did he sodomize you or what?

There is another thread on the same issue.

So as soon as they realized it they are terminating the contract what is wrong in it. Better late than never. Such contracts are called unconscionable  contract and void.

But Ver is calling OKCoin fraud when he is the one who entered the contract with fraudulent intention.

I don't think Ver will forgive OKCoin. This amounts to fraud. After all, it was managing bitcoin.com based on the same  agreement, overnight it has become not binding. Ver being a marathon litigation expert will take OKCoin to cleaners.

Is this even news?

That is why I say Roger Ver being Roger Smart. With shit site like bitcoin.com how can anyone make profits. OKCoin did not do due diligence but I think the contract was **Unconscionable Contract** ab initio, it won't be applicable. Void ab initio.

**The properly signed version of the contract (v7) had an early termination clause for Ver, but not one for OKCoin. Even the 6-month advance warning in the unsigned/forged version (v8) seems too restrictive. I would think that neither version was seen by a lawyer or by someone used to such contracts.**

Hi Roger. Though this a/c is new, I am as old as old is I have seen this sub when it had 1K subscribers.

OKCoin paying for its mistake; it did not do due diligence but Roger Ver sounds unethical to take advantage of OKCoin and their lack of language expertise. This is a learning experience for non-English BTC companies.

The site gets meager 4-5k traffic/daily which is nothing great. For 10K/month the website should have at least 50K/daily traffic. Ver new it all along, duped OKCoin.

How is it different from Jon Matonis' case. He messed up the Bitcoin Foundation and then joined some Bitcoin consultancy firm. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 17:38:15
So much ad hominem. You did not answer the questions I asked? A contract that favors one party over the other itself is unethical. Here it is pretty clear Roger Ver knew it. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:46:11
How is Roger Ver right claiming OKCoin is insolvent? Hope they hire a lawyer to sue Roger.
