Thanks for the IQ confirmation.

Some major assumptions about my motivations there. You don't know me well enough to make those claims. 
Anyway, I'm sure everyone wants to act normal and of course they have every right to. I also have the right to disagree. No need to resort to personal attacks.

I don't see how this has any relevance. I'm not advocating for censorship of opinions. I'm just explaining to you how those opinions make people feel uncomfortable.
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:09:56
Not asking for a 'safe space' (have the trumpets trademarked that yet?) just for people to not be dicks. Pretty easy. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:24:30
Quite a bit more to it than that.

This is simply not true to the totality that you claim. What you just described is much closer to communism. Possibly socialism and definitely not the left as a whole. I'd wager that your opinion on theses topics is informed largely by the corrupt attempts at implementing them rather than the core idea(s) themselves. 
It's like claiming Democracy is a bad idea because of the current state of the US or that liberalism is undesirable because it's been warped for political gains on the right. There's value in all these ideas.
That said, I whole heartedly agree with your last paragraph and believe that decentralization is one method we can use to navigate our way out of this mess.

The edit is irrelevant.

The people in this thread are ones stuck in the 15th century.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:04:44
You should seek mental help. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:16:08
Disgraceful. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:50:32
Wow, that's incredibly rude. I was just asking for a citation? Jeez.
Thanks for supplying anyway, checks out. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:11:36


Let's see a credible source for this claim please.  
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:57:31


I've never heard this and believed it. 8 years under Bush were anything but. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:18:34
100% agree. Was shocked to see the comments in this thread. Really dumb. Made me lose a lot of respect for this community. I thought you were smart people goddamit! 
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:23:54
Wow. That is unacceptable.
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:06:15


It's bizarre. Then again Bitcoin has always drawn the libertarian / anarchist crowd so doesn't surprise me that much.
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:02:32
You might want to consult a dictionary for the actual meaning...
@_date: 2016-12-22 03:01:42
You joke but anything's possible with a fentanyl addicted authoritarian. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:03:57
It's not rigged, unfair design but not rigged.

He is anything but moderate. How can you say that straight faced? His whole campaign played off divisive, reactionary rhetoric (to his success). 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:12:30
You sound like a great person
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:11:56
That's not the point. Look at the comments in this thread - complete arrogance and lack of understanding of the female viewpoint. It's not about segregation either, it's about making a more accepting community which seemingly can't be done here.
Look at the comment about Bitchcoin, would that make you feel accepted on if you were a woman? 
Get real yo.
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:52:39
Why is this thread not a good example? It's not gender discussion that is off putting anyway - not sure why you would think this? It's comments about hiring prostitutes with profits, or buying trophy wives and the like that create an unwelcoming environment. It's not just this sub either, it's an issue with the entire scene. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:55:20
Don't read the comments in this thread, you'll lose IQ by the character. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:24:40
Yeah...there's no 'fake votes' dude. You need to be more empirical because that opinion has no basis in reality. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:34:07
Wow..you are being totally deceived my friend. That website is about as fake as it gets. No domain, basic Wordpress theme, no legitimate authorship. How could you trust a site like this? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:21:47
Sorry dude! Totally misinterpreted your comment – I've been arguing on r_td too much I guess. Please accept my apologies.   
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:32:14
Couldn't agree more :( 
@_date: 2016-12-22 03:13:36
Yah yah. Troll all you want Alex if that's your goal. If you seriously believe what you're saying though then you need to talk more with people outside of your bubble. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:20:07
Because the current community is not very accepting to women. It can be downright demeaning at times. Look at the comments in here. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:46:52
I think the two parties are marginally different in action and largely represent the same conservative interests. None of what you described can be called 'leftist' in any objective sense. Unless of course you auto-attribute government subsides to left.
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:10:16
Take a deep breath. They're just reporting on the fall of bitcoin after the first bubble. They're not trying to take your wealth away from you...
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:14:02
Not even close to what's going on. You can either continue to be arrogant in your misunderstanding or you can start asking why.
@_date: 2016-12-22 13:03:01
Oh god..you Trump supporters are so simplistic. MSM this and that while most of those that voted for him will still froth at the mouth at the sound of the Fox news intro. The far left haven't touched the mainstream media in decades. It's you that have woken up late to the party and all thanks to a balding con-man that can't spell precedent.
