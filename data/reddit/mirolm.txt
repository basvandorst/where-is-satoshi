You know there are other former Soviet countries than Russia, right? For example Latvia, Estonia... And there is bigger freedom than in the US, for 100%.

They already sent money today, so this is not answer to my question

It's really not about arbitration or something like that. They sent like 50eur, wants to buy some small amount and send it to wallet. I regularly use SEPA with bitstamp and in 99% it is credited to account in 24 hours. They sent it today and I would like to know, when they should expect it to be credited. Tomorrow? Friday? Next week?

Information that 98% of trading is in China is completely wrong and it has been wrong for very long time. I would love to see your source, but if I can guess I would say it is from January or February? 
You can check yourself the numbers, how big volume is traded in China today, for example here: 
It is around 6-7% right now. Do your math before you throw up facts and numbers after 5 seconds of googling.

Great speech as always. But I must say, as not native English speaker, I have problem to catch some words, because of loud music. Honestly, the music is also little bit distracting (probably more for not native speaker again). It would be ok with little less volume.
