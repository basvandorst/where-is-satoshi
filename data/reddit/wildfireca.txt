What people don't understand is that the ETFs have already bought their coins to get approval from the FEC. So at first they won't drive the price up at all, but they will always wanted to keep that capital on hand to keep their leveraging in a one-to-one ratio. I'm guessing it is what the leveraging is but since the FEC is an asshole my guess is it's one to one when they let the banks have 50 to 1 leveraging. So in a few months they will start acquiring more coins and that will drive the price up. But at the same time the price will rise when the ETF is approved do the speculation alone.

**Bitcoin Technology Tested In Trial By 40 Big Banks**   ...................  **3/03/2016 @ 12:01AM 6,843 views**
The technology behind Bitcoin is starting to make progress on Wall Street.
By December, financial technology company R3 CEV had brought together a consortium of 42 banks to create standards and protocols for using blockchain technology in financial services.
Thursday, R3 announces that it has completed a trial in which 40 of its member banks tested five different blockchains to issue, trade and redeem a fixed-income product. The company believes that this is the largest trial on blockchain technology of a real-world process in the financial markets.
12 Warning Signs An Investment Is A Scam
The size of the trial demonstrates that even as fintech, Bitcoin and blockchain startups threaten to dismantle Wall Street’s grip on financial services, established players also intend to capitalize on technological innovation to make their products and services cheaper and faster — and could potentially do so quickly enough to ensure their future in what is likely to be a radically changed industry.
It’s not the only effort by established financial institutions to exploit the efficiencies of shared ledger technology. In late December, Nasdaq’s Linq product, which uses blockchain technology to manage shares in pre-IPO companies, recorded its first transaction, documenting the issuance of shares to a private investor.
“This development further supports R3′s belief that close collaboration among global financial institutions and technology providers will create significant momentum behind the adoption of distributed ledger solutions across the industry,” David Rutter, R3’s chief executive said in a statement. “These technologies represent a new frontier of innovation and will dramatically improve the way the financial services industry operates, in much the same way as the advent of electronic trading decades ago delivered huge advancements in efficiency, transparency, scalability and security.”
The group experimented with five distributed ledgers, provided by Chain, Eris Industries, Ethereum, IBM and Intel, all of which have developed such technologies either as open source projects or for enterprise.
The banks evaluated how well each technology ran smart contracts — computer programs that execute financial transactions — that helped issue, secondarily trade and redeem commercial paper, a type of fixed-income security corporations issue to raise short-term funds such as if they need capital to purchase inventory.
The distributed ledgers were hosted on cloud computing resources provided by Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud and Amazon AWS.
Member banks participating in this trial included Bank of America, Barclays, BBVA, Bank of New York Mellon, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, State Street, Wells Fargo and others.
“Blockchain is a powerful innovation that has the potential to create profound change in the way businesses interact,” said James Wallace, IBM’s vice president of Blockchain, Global industries in a statement. “Using IBM Blockchain services, a blockchain network was deployed within minutes, allowing the developers to rapidly focus on building a sample application for trading unsecured promissory notes within hours.”
While many observers of Bitcoin and blockchain technology say that a group with so many member institutions encumbered by bureaucracy is likely to be slow-moving, R3 has rather quickly experimented with new technologies. In January, 11 of its members, which included large financial institutions such as Barclays, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Wells Fargo, simulated the exchange of value on a distributed ledger (another term for blockchain technology) without using a central third party.
“By undertaking initiatives such as this one, R3 is further accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology by demonstrating, instead of simply asserting, the commercial advantages of this emerging approach to financial services,” said Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, in a statement.
R3, in addition to gathering a consortium of banks that is developing blockchain standards and protocols, is working to create new software that can act as a standard communication layer that would allow different ledgers, such as Ethereum’s public blockchain with Chain’s private one, to interact with each other. The company also has a lab for its bank members to run controlled experiments on the technology, and down the line, it intends to also offer commercial applications that would, for instance, lower the costs of post-trade processing, settlement, payments and so on.

This is not a risk I would be willing to take. If the coins are in your own wallet there is no chance you will loose your coins on the majority chain.

The BU nodes are not rejecting blocks signaling for Seperated Witness. They are rejecting blocks that have not yet appeared on the live chain and that will not be on the live chain for a while. My guess is if Segrated Witness was to get activated on the live chain the BU team would make it compatible with the BU nodes. Stating the obvious that you tried to put deep fryer oil in your diesel car with out converting it to run with fryer oil does not mean that the fryer oil is broken or the car is broken it mean your a fucking idiot for not setting the two up to run together. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:06:11
That is up to the Core team. First it will change Bitcoin Cores coin forever. Next they will be causing temporary instability in both coins and some people might loose a lot of money choosing the wrong coin. The white paper basically says that the most hash power that is on the longest chain controls Bitcoin because they have the most invested and the most to loose. By going against consensus they will be stepping in to the unknown. If I was the core team and I knew the hard fork was going to happen I would make an announcement of consensus for the greater good of BTC and it's users. Next I would get Blockstream to hire all the core devs and start working on top layer or second layer products for Bitcoin. This would be the best outcome and it would end up uniting the community and send BTC to the Moon.

It sounds like you know the risks and you're willing to take them. If that's a concern of yours then pre dump, or just hold them. Just because you want to try to profit when there's a slight hiccup in the road. I am suggesting the Devs spend there time helping you.

BU just broke 44.44% network consensus for the last 144 blocks mined for the first time ever. Segregated Witness is 10% behind Bitcoin Unlimited at this moment and BU is gaining traction fast. The only new large mines coming on-line in the next few months is John McAfee's (a BU supporter) 2.5 PetaHash that he is going to add the 2.5 PetaHash he already has. This is just speculation but my guess is that McAffee has already bought up all the miners from Bitmain's S10 run and this is why Bitmain has not brought any new miners to market since may 2016.

Bitcoin was originally created with unlimited blocksize, so we would be reverting back to the way it was. Unlimited blocksize has been fully tested on the live chain where Segregated Witness has been only tested on testnet and it is a year away from being ready. You can go test it on testnet your self and see.

I normally don't make price predictions but I am willing to make my first one as I have started to get better at it. I think the next jump up will go to a minium of $8000, with my guess being $10,000, with a maximum of $15,000. My charting shows that if it is able break out to $20,000 it's going to go parabolic but I do not think we are at that point yet. I expect this to happen in the next 2 weeks to 2 months. $20k is a big jump and I feel that we will need a BTC ETF or small island to switch there currency to make that happen, but you never know. One thing I do know for sure is that we have barely left the launch pad on our way to the MOON!!!!

No. The only thing that would happen is that we would have blocks that are 2x the size they are now. Nothing else would change. Literately the only change in the code would be from what it is now: MaxBlockSize 1 to MaxBlockSize 2. That's it,, easy peasy.

If you don't know how to secure your coins properly your investment will be worth 0. I would be more worried about how to secure my coins then how much they may go up. I have been doing this for a while now and at the end of the day the price will either be more then you can imagine or 0. This is a binary game that only has two outcomes. What I can tell you is when I start to see this much activity in Bitcoin the price jumps up exponentially. The Chinese gov may have delayed the jump for a few weeks but it is still going to happen.

I have never used multibit so someone else is going to have to help you. Also try googling pulling my private keys from multibit.  If your wallet has not synced yet wait until it has.. You should then see the other addresses. I would then move them to the address you want them to be in... What happened is you had your change control set to use so called change addresses.

If you want to fork the thing we should add 2mb blocks at the same time. This argument of what one we should have is BS. We should have both and will need both.

It could be changed to that also that way it would be future proof, at least for a while. If we had 3mb blocks all that would happen is that they would fill up to lets say 1.5mb and the rest of the 1.5mb would remain empty giving us a 1.5mb block. When Bitcoin first came out Satoshi made it with an Unlimited block size. They changed it to 1mb because the network was weak at the time and there was a theoretical way break Bitcoin using the unlimited block size. Now the network is the very strong. [\(Bitcoin mining network is 43 thousand times faster than every supercomputer on the top 500 list combined\)]( Theoretically at this point the Blockchain could handle blocks with an almost unlimited size.

I don't remember them saying anything about Asic boost in their advertising. Were you expecting a sick boost with your Miner? You weren't because they didn't sell it to you. What they do with their own technology is up to them. Asics boost has been known about for over two years. If Bitfury  was smarter they would have licensed the technology from bitmain.
@_date: 2017-04-25 03:27:36

I still don't understand why it matters if they report using a technology they own and built. Are you saying if they disclose it tomorrow they are free to turn it on? What are your thoughts on Bitfury coming up with a way to make an ASIC that is 5000% faster than the current speed and they decide to make and mine with them their my own. Is that ok? What rules do we want to have for innovation in regards to mining machines? Who is going to decide what is ok and and what is not.

I have not seen it yet.  I don't understand why someone would be obligated to tell you what kind of technology they are using to mine Bitcoins. Next why would you want to block innovation? Why not licence it or come up with something similar or better. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:19:13
I am not trying to block anything. Segwit/Core is the one blocking larger blocks because it does not fit with the Segwit profitability model. So instead of adapting like they should with AB or larger blocks size, they try and block it. Even the Lighting Network is seriously looking at using FlexTras because it is better, newer, and suits there needs perfectly. It's like Segwit 2.0, but that's non of my business.

It's only an issue if you think Segwit is the only answer to scaling. It seems to me Segwit is the one that is incompatible as there is a patent for AB. Plus it has already been implemented, where Segwit is still a proposal at this point. Segwit knew about the patent years ago and did not account for it.

Is does not address the fact that Bitcoin needs bigger blocks. No one is saying no to Segwit, people are saying no to making the block size larger

If anyone else used it they would be in violation of the patent. Just because other companies are too stupid to come up with such a thing does not mean it's bad. You would think a smart company would take advantage of such a thing. If Bitmain uses it on it's next gen chips are you going to have a fit then too?

A hard fork will not have a coin split as the minority chain will be terminated. Anyone telling you there will be 2 coins is a fucking idiot. There is no point in talking to me about this we are forking Bitcoin to increase the network capacity as it is the simplest solution to a full block. Separated Witness/lighting is not even ready yet and it looks like it might not be ready for up to 2 years. Bitcoin will be dead before the end of year if this problem is not fixed ASAP. A UASF is another stupid idea as the network would be insecure and the minority chain would be attacked and killed off. Plus a UASF is way more contentious then changing the block size back to the way it was.  
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:39:32
Nowhere where in Cores road map is there's a place for two megabyte or larger blocks. This is why people are forking the network. If core added two megabyte blocks six months ago no one would even know who Bitcoin Unlimited is. Even today they could probably take out Bitcoin Unlimited by just adding 2 megabyte blocks tomorrow, but as we can all see larger blocks are not anywhere in Cores road map, so we are going to fork this fucker

So if Segwit, Lighting, Bitcoin or Lightcoin finds a technical advantage they should tell everyone? Like say in a patent? You are saying that they should be telling everyone what they have and what they are doing with it. I see, just like the US should have done when they were making the atom bomb, they should have told everyone what they were doing and where and how they were going to use it.

Do 10Mb blocks then. You have to think we are going to have to have enough BTC transaction capacity for when the aliens show up. Segregated Witness is meant to enable off chain transactions, it does next to nothing to fix the full block problem of Bitcoin.  If you think about it when your hard-drive is full you increase your capacity. Any other solution to the full hard-drive is counter productive and a work-a-round at best. Usually the simplest solution to a problem is the best one.

The company and the share holders are way better off now. For starters we are now getting 40% of the profit from both the mining and hardware sales. Before the share swap we were getting 10% of just the mining company. The mining company was then going to give a 0% interest loan to the miner sales company that the share holders had no stake in. The next thing we did was get the total shares available to the market brought down from 100,000,000 shares to 25,000,000 shares. On top of it all the 60% of the shares management holds will not be collecting dividends until AMC has enough money to pay off the chip manufacture. Dividend day is tomorrow.

Just wanted to drop a quick note about the pending transactions and down time over the past couple of days.  We have been working hard to re-architect our backend to keep up with growth.  The demand for bitcoin recently has been amazing and the site has received a large increase in traffic.  It looks like we’re almost out of the woods, but we want to be careful with how fast we change things, and run an extensive set of tests before pushing the upgrade live.
We realize it is very frustrating to have transactions stuck in a pending state.  Rest assured that they will go out.  This definitely wasn’t our intention; the growth caught us off guard and it’s been pretty embarrassing to let down our customers.  Thank you for bearing with us as we try to keep up with the growth of bitcoin!

I have been using  to buy coins. I think I may check out  next time due to the lower fees. Asking other people for investment advice is not a good idea. The reason is that you can learn from your own mistakes fix them, and then do better next time. If you listen to someone for advice you will not have as much incite to make corrections for successful trading. 
Were on a high right now and it's steady. If your planning a short term trade I would worry about the high and low but if you can wait and you double your money you won't care about the 3-4 bucks per coin you might save.

They use the space time continuum theory to extract quarks from the nanosphere. Once the quarks have self replicated in a perfect sphere we then can extract them from the nanosphere. Every time they come out the nanosphere there exactly the same and this is how the addresses are encrypted. So if you can recreate the correct nanosphere you can access the coins in that address. This is how addresses basicly work.

Try to think of a bitcoin as a commodity like wheat or gold. It takes a certain amount of time and effort grow or mine any commodity, you as the miner are able to get a price for your efforts if someone else sees value in your item. Since it hard to send gold or wheat to China for your new cell phone case there is a need for an easier way to send money. Paypal and the banks take too long, want an arm and a leg for the transaction fees, for doing nothing more then letting there computer focus on sending our money for a second. Eventually what happens is if your slow to react to a need and don't change your ways, a new solution to the problem will not only present it's self but have people actually put faith and change in there regular patterns to make the new solution successful.

CaVirtex has excellent customer support,, try calling them. 
They also just lowered there fees the other day.

Why the down vote? 
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:52:17
Yes,, because they are more scarce. If you have put your cash in too Bitfloor the price on MtGox means nothing too you as you can not buy those coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:47:16
do you have a link to the profile,, I want to use that tag too.

Unless you have tons of time to research the mining company's I would stay away from mining and buy BTC. Then try to find BTC investments to play with.

Hardcore bitcoiners like the ability to be able to diversify there assets without moving back in too a fiat currency. Alt coins let them do this. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 02:30:34
My guess is that it's GPU miners that are shutting down there rigs and are cashing out the last of mined coins.

It's people who are not proficient at backup's and computer security. These people are also unwilling to learn how to protect there wealth as they are too busy working to make money.
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:12:01
If its an honest mistake return the funds. If it were the other way around you would want Cavirtex to return the funds to you.

This policy is going to kill Virtex. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:48:58
Virtual Mining says they will be shipping in Dec at TGB. I think they are getting a very small batch of machines at the end of this month and will be up to full speed in Dec. 
@_date: 2013-02-09 20:21:30
I took a screen shot for when they fix the problem on there site. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:40:19
Virtual Mining should have the next batch of miners on the market.

I added you to my friends list. I have always wanted to play with bitcoin.

That was good.. It's getting harder and harder to debunk the coin without smiling at the same time.

I have had 2 people plus my self park BTC in ASICMINER-PT. Its a good investment plus I feel better about the people I got in to BTC having shares and not BTC on there own PC. There not as mindful about backups and security as I would want them to be. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 16:14:23
I agree we should doing our best to make sure no one else gets scammed. If new people are getting scammed out the door its going to give BTC a bad name. We should be singing praise for people like Fryedcat, and warning people about scams like this so those scams don't keep getting funding to continue the scam.

If someone offered a service that was 7% less then WU could, it would take off pretty easily. If it were me I would open a few point to point locations, starting with the locations that WU has the most volume between two points.
