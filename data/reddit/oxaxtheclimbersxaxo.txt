The way i suppose to send bitcoin is trough address right ? so for example i create an wallet address on lets say poloniex and buy bitcoin on bitstamp i will need to wrtie or scan my waller address from poloniex and i send the bitcoin from bitstamp to poloniex ? could you write a feedback if im thinking right ? And Thank You so much for all of your help.
