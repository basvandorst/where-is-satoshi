Noob move.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:47:02
Same lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:55:13
He makes good points though.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:15:16
I can't even get verified on Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:03:21


Smart move.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:57:26


Not anymore. There are debit cards that solve that issue. Revolut.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:00:14


Most of you are privileged, white libertarians who just want to make money. Get over yourselves.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:04:59
It really does. OP didn't even know the basics of securing his Bitcoin. Can't compare us. There are winners and losers. You seem like a loser too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:04:26
In the ludicrous situation that Bitcoin becomes worthless, I'm willing to lose the bank's money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:59:13
If you have student loans, you won't have to make payments until you leave school.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:02:49
That dude made big gains even with this current dip. It's called taking risks for big rewards. I took out student loans to buy crypto and will continue to do.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:56:54
Crypto has saved a lot of people from wage slavery.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:36:17
I'm pretty smart myself. OP not so much.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:32:01
What do you predict the growth of Bitcoin's marketcap to be in the next few years? Do you think the growth % will be greater than say, 9-15% ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:36:42
Thank you buddy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:58:06
Paying with crypto should be on everyone's radar. Some of us actually want mass adoption and aren't focused only on personal gain. Debt is not a big deal. In most cases, there are ways to alleviate or escape it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:07:55
Damn, what a boss!
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:21:29


Yes, that was the point.....Thanks for showing you have basic reading comprehension.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:22:43
I'll have to keep attending, but it's possible to reach that goal before graduation. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:25:34
More like my future prosperity. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:47:35
Worked out for me.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:20:11


You can default on federal loans.......... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:59:35
You can pay off debt with your crypto gains.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:57:45


Continue with my plan every semester.  I'll treat the crash as a massive dip. Losing a few thousand will mean nothing in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:52:10
I'm still confident.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:04:50
You are welcome
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:06:38


13k used to be an ATH for BTC. With discipline and long term goals, they will be better off than the fool that got an iphone.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:36:27
I'm sold!
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:02:57
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:30:35
What a ridiculous question.....
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:21:37


Luckily, Bitcoin is nothing like a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:52:57


And you're investing in that technology.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:08:08


The next semester silly. Is there another way to take out loans that you know about?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:15:59


Well duh. That's the point of using the loans...... This plan shows high risk and high reward.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:49:25


I don't see anyone doing that. The amount of risk doesn't change the fact that you're investing.
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:47:01
The better term is bull market.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:47:22
Live and learn.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:40:09
Why just two months? You seem very short-sighted and shouldn't be calling anyone an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:07:22
I believe it already has.
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:10:44
Yobit, Litebit.eu, Gemini, LocalBitcoins etc.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:50:36


Wow dude. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:02:13
West coast of Florida. A lot of smaller towns.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:04:37
Use multiple exchanges daily. It can be done in a week.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:38:42
That's what I plan on doing for the next few years. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:05:12
Use several exchanges daily.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:45:23
Most students don't make much considering they don't have a degree/certification yet. Einstein.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:23:20
A time machine would come in handy!
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:47:43
We're in the early stages.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:33:13
It has market cap of over 70 biillion lol. It's crazy how people think it would drop anywhere close to zero in a short period of time.
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:04:43
Calculated risks baby. I will continue to do so. I just wish my loans came in time for the recent dip. It would've been foolproof gains.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:42:17


1. Wishing for that to happen is pretty scummy.
2. Bitcoin will never go lower than $3000 ever again. 
3. Those people missed out on huge profits. 300% gains &gt; several years of 7% interest (that doesn't apply to subsidized loans while still in school). 
@_date: 2017-09-10 04:48:45
This comment section is gold.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:32:30
Quit siding with the banks!
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:31:01
I use credit cards and student loans to buy crypto and I'm far from an idiot. So mean.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:00:22
It's not that simple and you should know that.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:58:12
You do make a few good points. However, you sound like someone without a soul. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:32:55
The success rate doesn't even have to be that high if I just hold until I graduate. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:03:32
Not cool dude.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:24:42


What's so significant about the end of the month? My guess is there's nothing and you're just trying to sound smart. There's a bitcoin fork at the end of the month and litecoin fork coming afterward. There may be a Monero fork as well. IMO, the smart guys are focusing on ICO's, forks and mid-level alt coins. Many day traders got wrecked recently.
