Where you hold then? And what you mean, "a safe place to buy and sell"? A safe place to buy things online with your coinbase BTC wallet?

What should I use then? I kinda dont wanna have it on my HDD at home.

Luckily I only have 1 EUR in BTC in my BTC Vault so far! What would you recommend as my BTC Vault?

Does that seem secure enough?

Im currently doing my Driver's Lessons, so I will have a license soon.
But I hope I can solve this some other way with gdax/coinbase.
Thanks for your Comments! :))

I don't currently need a passport.
It's unacceptable, that I cannot use my Cash anymore on GDAX, because I do not own a passport or drivers license?!

I already verificated successfully with my Identity Card.
It says I would need an additional step to verificate my identity.

Sorry, English is not my main language. I meant 'verify' instead of verificate.

sadly i cannot use GDAX anymore because they wont let me trade until i verify my "passport or drivers license" which I do not own.  
I only have a Identity Card and thats verified already...  
so frustrating

I'd like to buy / sell /  trade on gdax and not on coinbase.

No, I live in Switzerland.
I did never make a deposit over 10k. I dont even have over 10k on that gdax account.

I do carry an ID, but not a passport.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:19:44
"Typically". But they want me to verify a PASSPORT. I already verified my ID lile i said.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:55:02
Wot? What manual?

If a system doesnt work, it probably doesnt have anything to do with the terms of use
