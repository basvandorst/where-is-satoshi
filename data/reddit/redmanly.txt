In order for the price to crash, people have to be willing to sell for less than $1. But if they do, they will be taking a loss. Of course some people will sell for less than a $1 but hopefully other people buy those BFX coins and maintain the price atleast $1

If you are looking for an exchange that supports both BTC/CAD and BTC/EURO, check out Monetago. They recently launched and support over 28 currencies.
So you can buy BTC on their Canadian market and then sell in the Euro market on the same site
Not sure how the withdrawal process works but you should email them first

Ya it is risky that they are not backing up each currency fully.
However, I want to point out that your surge of 5% example is overestimated. Uphold has 3,633.413 BTC in its reserves and owes customers 4,884.951 BTC. So if BTC goes up 5% there obligations do turn increase by $101,391.36 but that doesn't put them in a deficit since their 3,633.413 BTC would have also increased in value.
But your point is still valid because the difference between amount owed and amount in reserve does get bigger as the price of BTC goes up.

Ya, but the Bitcoin you send there just gets converted to Tether (aka your Bitcoin gets converted to USD).

What do you mean use Tether to store Bitcoin? Converting Bitcoin to Tether is the same thing as selling Bitcoin for USD

Just to clarify, its not really fair to compare Coinbase to Gemini because Gemini is an **exchange** where as Coinbase is an online wallet software that allows you to purchase and sell bitcoins based on their pricing (which is why there is a markup).
However, Coinbase does offer an **exchange** service ( and it makes more sense to compare GDAX with Gemini

That address is a change address, I don't believe those are displayed with the sending/receiving addresses but your wallet still has the private keys to them.

Im pretty sure the reason your seeing a blank page is because Cryptsy does not allow you to withdraw into a currency that does not belong to the country you are verified with.
For example, if you are a verified user as US citizen then you can only withdraw USD and not EUR and CAD. At least thats what they told me when i emailed them asking if i can withdraw CAD

I've noticed that people on this subreddit tend to completely shit on Coinbase because the "fees are too high" or "trading on Coinbase sucks", even though they fail to realize that Coinbase.com is not meant as a trading platform and Coinbase actually offers an exchange service gdax.com that is meant for trading bitcoin and has very reasonable fees

Late reply, my apologies.
In order to use GDAX you need a Coinbase account. So yes, I guess you can think of it that way.
