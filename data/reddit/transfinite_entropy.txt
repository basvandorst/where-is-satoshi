And if it it is stolen?
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:42:38
Real banks are perfectly capable of keeping much larger amounts of money secure.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:45:50
And how will one be 100% of never, ever forgetting that password for their entire life?
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:47:26
And how many people are actually going to do this? I am a professional Systems admin who understands bitcoin very well and I have absolutely no desire to do any of this. It is like having platinum bars I need to keep safe forever.

What if I don't want to be my own bank? Real banks seem capable of keeping much larger amounts of money safe.

Indeed. Bitcoin's irreversibility heavily favors thieves.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:14:55
At this rate 98% of all bitcoins will be stolen. And you cannot compare predictable inflation to mass theft.
Money is supposed to be a means of exchange that facilitates transactions. This means that it SHOULD be mildly inflationary. Deflation causes people to stop spending, which is bad.

But then anyone could just read it and steal my bitcoins, or I would have to remember an encryption password. We are back to where we started.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:43:40
The irreversible nature of bitcoin transactions makes theft easier.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:46:18
That has worked out OK so far.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:11:38
That doesn't seem very convenient at all. And you still need to backup the Trezor. Do I put that in my shoe?

Humanity is more prosperous than ever.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:05:58
Seriously. My company contracts a company to monitor our security logs.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:09:20
This was either an inside job or truly staggering incompetence.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:07:21
And what if you forget the private key? You will need to remember it for the rest of your life.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:55:26
And there is a reason I only have a few hundred dollars in cash.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:47:18
Their solution is to store your own bitcoins, which can be very safe, but if you forget the password (head injury, dementia) or lose the device you will have permanently lost ALL your bitcoins.

I'm not, I don't own any. I'm into machine learning to select peer 2 peer loans, and that is earning my over 40% Return on Equity with leverage. I just find bitcoin a truly amazing technological achievement and the blockchain has revolutionary potential. Bitcoin as a currency simply sucks right now. It is also an endless source of entertainment.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:01:08
Bitcoin velocity is very low. It is being treated more as an investment than a currency.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:54:43
You basically have to trust third parties to hold your money to do anything useful with it.
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:29:09
Probably about 160

This is one of the single shittiest comment threads I have ever seen on reddit.
@_date: 2016-05-31 04:11:00
Doesn't that make BitCoin very deflationary in the long term?
