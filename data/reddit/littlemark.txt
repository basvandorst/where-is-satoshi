Haha, do I dare ask what the prize is? :D
Seriously though - welcome to the slightly crazy but always fascinating world that is Bitcoin. I wish you all the success in the world.

It's been a long and pretty exciting ride so far! Here's to the next 300k!

You're not the only one - every time I see people talking about stuff "in the cloud" it makes me think of pictures in computing textbooks I was reading in the 80s and 90s where the local net would connect off to a WAN (depicted as a cloud) with a thunderbolt.

Buy something for your bits with your bits? ;)

Interesting stuff.  My immediate knee-jerk thoughts on the time stamp were "when's the epoch?", and "Why isn't it 64-bits long?"
Do you have anything in your considerations that addresses those topics ?

    The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
That do ya? ;)

We're talking 2009 here, so Alistair Darling held the position of chancellor, but he was considered largely a puppet for Brown, who was at that point Prime Minister.

Oh, my first ever tip! Thanks :)

Sounds to me like sabre-rattling for political points. These guys either don't understand the tech, or are hoping that the general populace doesn't. 
It will be interesting to see what they actually *do*.

Now we know the face of our enemy... Small, blind, wearing a fuzzy jacket and covered in dirt. :D

...But wait! That's not all! Order now, and we'll also send you a box full of cats to welcome you as a member! You'll literally be drowning in karma and hairballs!

Aha, knew I meant to do something the other day! Purchased. 
@_date: 2013-07-21 22:55:02
Awesome, I can see these being very powerful tools!

Indeed. When someone's income relies on them deliberately misunderstanding something to manufacture controversy and create page views, you can guarantee they're going to get it wrong.

The difficulty, I imagine, would be doing that in such a way that everyone knows about it and allows you to retain reputation, customers, etc. - except not let HMRC know.
I can't help but think anyone attempting such a thing would be made a rather severe example of in very short order.

Well, thank goodness for that - I was worried the entire supply of drugs and other black market items was going to dry up overnight... ;)
