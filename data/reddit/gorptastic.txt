Well, that's not really short selling BTC at all! You're simply cashing out of your long position and waiting until a more favorable time comes to go long again. You believe BTC will go down, but it's not speculation unless you're taking a position.


This is a 5 day chart with 30 minute periods. I'm using 50/200 moving averages and trying to predict where BTC is going next.
Seriously? You expect to forecast some trend on *5 days* of data??? Especially 5 days after one of the most volatile periods of BTC ever? I don't know if that's a good idea. Even if there MIGHT be an apparent trend, you're never supposed to speculate on charts without at least looking through the fundamentals. If the purpose is only speculation, you might want to look beyond more than 5 days of data!!


Okay, if this is what investing means.

The NYSE can halt trading of any security on its exchange. Usually it happens at gradated levels (i.e. market falls 10 percent, close trading for 1 hour; market falls 30 percent, close for rest of day). Considering that the Bitcoin market fell over 60 percent overnight due to panic selling, MTGox's actions seem reasonable IMO.

If I had to guess, it's probably because of a liquidity premium for Bitcoins on the Gox exchange. Since Bitstamp handles only a small fraction of the market, making deals might be more difficult. So to entice people to trade, that difference (which we assume should be arbitraged) is the result of liquidity differences.
