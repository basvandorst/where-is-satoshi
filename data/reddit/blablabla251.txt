When I pay for 100 Mb/s I should be able to use my 100 Mb/s on whatever I want to use it on the internet. I don't want my ISP to decide what I can and can't do on the internet by throttling my bandwidth to sites they don't like. That's why I support net neutrality.

I had issues when I updated my ledger and it was because the ledger manager app on the computer wasn't updated to the least version. I had to uninstall and install the app to get it to update.
