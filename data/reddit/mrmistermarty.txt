I just don't get that BTC is overpriced since you can buy partial amounts.  It's really about the percentage increases, right?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:59:07
1.5% is high? I thought that is not bad to get an instant buy from your bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:51:45
True but that $60,000 is probably worth $100k so I wouldn't be worried about the 900.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:50:27
Not really if you use Coinbase since its a percentage.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:00:29
Very true.   And the 10s of Trillions added by the previous two guys too.

Totally agree that the US Dollar and other fiat currencies are backed by debt but the US GDP is too big to allow it to completely fail. Right?  It's backed by the US government and I don't see that going away anytime in our life.

Well by instant I mean that you are locked in on that price but you don't get the BTC for a week.  But since I'm holding them for a while, it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:46:26
This is my exact thought for the reason to just pay the Coinbase 1.5% fees.  By the time you would deposit money from your Bank Account, BTC will have gone up way more than that measly 1.5%.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:02:32
And they charge you 1.5% right?

I just received my Ledger Nano S the other day and was able to send .0001 BTC from Coinbase to GDAX for free (only took a few seconds) and then from GDAX to my hw wallet address (only took about 10 mins) for free.  Super easy to do and I want to now transfer the rest of my money to the wallet (little bit nervous but will do so in increments since its free).
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:40:19
so is it alright to leave it at GDAX for now?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:17:31
Gotcha thanks.  Or could I just write down the bitcoin address (is that right?) and store it in a closet in my house?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:41:21
Is this falling just because no one can get onto Coinbase.com to sell/buy?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:25:20
I guess sorta like it did the other month before the fork that almost happened.  So it jumped up fast to 7800 and then dropped fast to 5500.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:08:15
Seems like for my small investment, I should try out the paper wallet.  Especially since I'm very organized and doubt anyone would break into my house for that.  
So when you put your coins on a wallet, does it not make any more money through GDAX?  And if that isn't the case, then when is a good time to start using a paper wallet?
Thanks for this information.  This is very helpful.  I would say this is the one aspect of Bitcoin that makes me nervous to invest is that I wouldn't want to lose any of my invested money.  I feel safe through my bank when I put money into mutual funds or ETFs.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:15:21
Perfect.  Seems pretty easy to create a BTC address as a paper wallet and then send my coins from GDAX to that.  However once I have money in a wallet, it seems that Coinbase doesn't let you deposit from there.  I cannot seem to find any info that Gemini lets you import money from a wallet.  
edit: I think this link tells me how to deposit from a wallet to Gemini: 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:03:16
Ugh I keep putting off buying into bitcoin and might as well jump in on a 1/2 a coin or a full coin but it just keeps going up!  Might even just buy it through Coinbase and deal with the 1.5% fee since it's going up and up.  This going to dip anytime soon?
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:32:11
Alright I think I'm getting the hang of this. Been reading a bunch of articles and then coming back to ask you more. Appreciate it. 
So if I have this whole process correct and not get charged any fees, I'd like to try moving some coins around. My coins are on gdax and I see that I can withdraw them to an address which I can enter with my breadwallet app that I just downloaded. Is that one any good? Or I can send them to the address of a paper wallet that I created. Then when I'm ready to sell those coins, I can transfer them to Gemini by depositing the coins from the address I have. Is that right? To which you mentioned that Gemini can send the USD money to my bank account with no fees. 
So with these steps, is it actually possible to transfer money from my bank account to Gemini, buy bitcoins, stash them in a wallet and then cash out to my bank with no fees at? Seems like I'm bound to hit a fee at some point.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:39:37
Need some help on this.  So I transferred money to Coinbase and then moved it over to GDAX where I did a limit buy to avoid fees.  Right now I have my bitcoin there.  Is it okay to leave it on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:17
so then even if you bought in big at 10k, it'd be best to hodl, right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:37
That's what I bought in at with the majority of my fiat.  Makes me nervous when I see it dip down to 9000 but I'm going to hodl and wait for a long time with this.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:23:37
Yea that drives me nuts that it takes almost a week to transfer money over to Coinbase without any fees and then move it to GDAX to do a limit order.  Sometimes I think it is worth just buying through Coinbase and eating the 1.5% since the damn market is booming so much anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:54:51
How does a ACH withdrawals work?  I tried pulling money on GDAX from my bank account and that took a while too.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:48:22
Thanks again.  I've heard of Gemini and I guess I should use them to withdraw to my bank account when I want to cash out eventually.  Is it hard to send my bitcoins from GDAX over to Gemini?  Or I guess sending it from GDAX to Coinbase to Gemini?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:41:46
What about Ripple?
I bought into ETH for the first time the other day at $474 and I plan on keeping it for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:40:58
Hmmmm....that number is so much different than 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:52:16
I understand now.  I think my confusion is that having a 1 bitcoin on paper makes it harder for me to remember what I bought it at.  Leaving it on Coinbase or GDAX lets me see what value I purchased it at which helps me know how much it has more (or lost).  
Right now I have .12 bitcoin so maybe I should just move it off unless I plan on putting more money towards it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:32:38
is this part of the reason that BTC is falling so much lately?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:10:08
Oh nice that will help once I move over to a paper wallet.  What is your process for investing in Bitcoin or other currencies?  You seem like a fountain of knowledge on this so I wouldn't mind following your moves.  Right now what I'm doing is depositing money to my Coinbase account, wait a damn week, then transfer it over to GDAX and purchase a limit order.  That is all I have done in the past 2 months.  I'll probably hang onto this investment for a while (hodl) and buy some more later down the road.  I haven't looked into other currencies or storing the coins or even cashing out (which I researched and seems to be about 1.5% if I moved my coins back to Coinbase to transfer back to my bank account.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:57:33


Is it better that I do that or leave them at gdax?  I bought some on coinbase and some on gdax.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:37:47
but if I move my money over to GDAX trade website, then I should be okay, right?  
I'm thinking about dumping more money into bitcoin but just not sure where to do that and at what cost to finally jump back in.  Bought in back at $3800.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:57:33


Is it better that I do that or leave them at gdax?  I bought some on coinbase and some on gdax.
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:09:46
I plan on buying 0.5 Bitcoin soon and will probably get it through coinbase. Should I transfer that to gdax or leave it at coinbase when I want to cash it out at some point?
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:01:46
That's what I have started doing now instead of buying $100 over at Coinbase.  But is it a good idea to keep my money at GDAX?
