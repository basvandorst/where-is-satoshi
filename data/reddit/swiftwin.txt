Bingo. That's why it's important to read the white papers when investing in a cryptocurrency. Is the tech sound? Does it make sense? I guarantee you that we currently are, or soon will be in a cryptocurrency bubble. A big crash will come. Does that mean that cryptocurrencies as a whole are doomed? Of course not! It's just part of the growing pains. Natural selection if you will...  
Just because you believe a tech will succeed, doesn't mean you'll make money off of it. Even if you're right, you can still lose everything. Separate the tech from the investment.

No, it showed how worthless many of the websites and companies were. Similar to the way how many worthless ICOs and altcoins are out there right now. I think it's a very good comparison.

He's still not wrong. Lots of ICOs out there are borderline pyramid schemes. Especially considering they are nowhere near as regulated as IPOs were during the dot-com boom. Again, look at the height of the dot-com boom. The NASDAQ did not go back to year 2000 levels until 2015. Yet the internet still succeeded and became ubiquitous in those years. That goes to show how highly overvaluated these companies were in 2000. The exact same thing can happen to cryptocurrencies as a whole. The tech may succeed, but the valuation may be completely off. Nobody knows the true value of cryptos. That's why it's called SPECULATION.  
I swear, some idealists around here who want to "stick it to the man" are going to get destroyed.

He's not talking about the internet as a piece of technology being a fad. He's talking about the investment in the internet being a speculative bubble and a fad, which is correct. After the Dot-Com bust, the NASDAQ (the main technology index) didn't recover until 2015.

Exactly how I feel too. I do think that the crypto currency craze is similar to the dot com boom. In there sense that there's alot of garbage ICOs and altcoins out there that will inevitably crash. A few will survive, like how Amazon and Google did after the bust.
