So Xapo is taking a page out of PayPal’s play book? No surprise, considering Xapo’ ceo is a board member of PayPal! 
I hate PayPal with a passion. It’s a criminal enterprise for sure, freezing and stealing money under the guise of ‘security’.

Practical people who aren’t in denial and who care about transaction speed and costs. I don’t hate BTC, and if the transaction speed and fees were lower than BCH, I would buy hold and use BTC.

When I was around 10 I once shot bottle rockets across the pond straight at a cop car (didn’t see it). Cop drove straight to me with sirens on and confiscated my stash of bottle rockets and firecrackers that my sister bought for me from out of state (firecracker legal state). 
Based on you bitcoin core guys that claim Roger is a criminal, I should be one too. 
Guys, stop spreading exaggerated misinformation, it’s not good for the crypto market, and destroys your credibility.

How about stopping with the personal attacks on Roger and everyone else? It’s very childish and immature, you give off a really hateful vibe. Your life will improve once you stop the hating.

I also do use stellar lumens for transferring funds due to the low cost and fast confirmation as well as future potential.
I believe privacy focused coins such as dash will not survive the upcoming regulations as cryptos become more mainstream.
As for litecoin, I simply prefer BCH as it’s closest to the origin bitcoin philosophy of peer to peer cash. 
Really, no hate towards BTC or you!
