This video will be part of BTC’s history forever. How can I long Indian dances and Bollywood movies?

Also, Bitmex, it offers up to 100X leverage, but I don't go anywhere near that.

Only people who have not made a genuine, sustained effort at trading say that.

I only trade BTC on margin.

My strategy is to now make FUD comments. Everyone’s on hopium. I’m going to try to make people doubt bitcoin so that people short for once, which will give fuel for the price to go up.

No it's not the same. Gambling is complete luck, this is based on a prediction. Think about it. Why are you holding? Because you expect it to go up. Are you sure about this? No? Well then by your logic you're going to the casino and putting everything on red. Yes? Well then, why? Because you think it has fundamental value? Okay, well then, why not keep longing (betting the price will go up where you can do this on leverage) it? It's basically a form of doubling down on your bets.

Margin shorting the bounces and holding them.

Based on what? Why do the percentages change every time I see these kinds of comments (0.5%..5%..10%). You clearly just made that number up.

Read my last reply to you.

Also, I did not say more than the amount since 2013. I said more than 2017.

It's regarding a partner on Coinbase's newest product which released today. How would anyone know the partner before today? -.-
