Bitcoin going galaxy wide

I think it was a little longer then two days but I could be wrong. How long has this one been going on? I've just been hodling until this morning.

Solid play, I'm not stuck on the HODL 100%. I just feel there's still some upside yet before I get rid of the rest. I was in low.. took 75% still have 25%. If it hits 12k I will sell and look for another position.

Stay away from meth kids.

I posted because I hope some new comers do stick around and understand what is taking place here. I tried being a little more elaborate with my post rather then the other generic HODL posts. I think I got conversation flowing in the sub a little bit which is the point of the forum afterall.

Username checks out, shill. Please direct yourself back to your sub until bitcoin's blockchain is no longer under attack. 
Thank you

Wow cyber criminals stealing bitcoin using the same exact methods they use to steal every other type of currency? Who would have thunk..

Are you shorting? I personally think we can still hit 20k but I won't go for broke just like any other sane trader shouldnt. Good to hear from the perspective of another trader thanks for your input.

It's actually Wednesday my dudeee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:18:37
In at 6k, thank you for your concerns though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:04:58
I agree but also think alot of this is shills.

What is the downside to increasing the block size? Something to do with miners?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:50
Sorry to hear that, ONLY if you can afford it I'd average down if I was you.

The term you're looking for is swing trading &amp; it's quite risky. Also need a decent amount of capital to make it worth your time anyway.
