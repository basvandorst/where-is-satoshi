It is hard to predict market reaction but it could be catastrophic. If bad actors get the private keys then just by moving the coins they can do a lot of damage to the market. If the system private then this type of attack can be prevented. I don't think this is a hypothetical either.
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:47:30
If privacy can be implemented on the base layer then it should. "Transparency" can quickly turned into forced transparency.

The supporters of eth cling to future development improvements as if it would change the fact that eth is anti store of value. Billions down the drain. If btc community was more supportive of counterparty eth would never gained so much power.
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:56:43


Satoshi is an abstract in this case. Early mined coins. The fact we can track them is a big problem for the market and network security.


The market price of btc is why the network is so secure. Users pay miners mine. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:24:26


In practice this is not how it works. If satoshi moves coins the market will be destroyed. The security of the network depended on price of btc.
@_date: 2018-09-01 07:30:04
If the price too low a rogue actor can preform a 51% attack and short the market. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:40:03
Counterparty=bitcoin. If your token has liquidity it can be moved to lightning. If it has none it might as well be priced out.
The apathy and sometimes even hostility towards counterparty came with a great cost. Bitcoin network effects suffered. Instead of attracting talent, users and $billions all of it was pushed to alts. 
Sidechains such as Rootstock are centralized non solutions IMHO. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 07:39:43
Bitcoin is money. Without "the market" you are left with numbers that have no monetary value.
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:56:39
The network you build on is unstable because of eth. Better build on top of btc.

"Massive compute farms" don't exist in isolation. Their existence is a direct result of market price of bitcoin not the other way around.
Users pay miners mine. 
If the silly app crypto gains 20 million active users then it would be reflected in the hash power of that coin.
Bitcoin used almost exclusively by speculators (gamblers). So the notion that if an altcoin out-competes bitcoin then it is game over for crypto is misguided at best. 
After almost a decade of existence bitcoin has less users than candy crush. Bitcoin impact on society today is negligible. The network effects of bitcoin are small. It can be easily replaced.
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:52:05
Thanks for the lovely chat. Remember bitcoin is just an experiment at this stage it is yet to deliver its' napster moment. So don't commit to it too much.
It is quite possible that some meme coin with an addictive game will take over bitcoin. 
This is why I believe that the early players with deep pockets should support the development of apps.
At this point hodling is far more dangerous than investing in development.
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:05:39
Bitcoin doesn't solve envy, resentment and greed. When you talk about gold not being scarce the same can be said about altcoin inflation. The value of crypto is in network effects. 
If some random dude invents a silly app that goes viral and that app uses his brand of crypto then that crypto will out-compete bitcoin easily. Don't be fooled by reddit echo chamber. Bitcoin is still nerd money it has almost zero effect on society. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:27:20


Mining is not some ideological pursuit it is fueled by greed. This is supported by the white paper.
@_date: 2018-06-05 19:26:37


Correct. There is no need for other units of account. But people are greedy. If you can make 100x profit building altcoin app, why would you invest the same amount of effort building bitcoin apps and get almost nothing in return. You would only make early players rich. There are very few incentives to bring innovation to bitcoin. 
Hodlers must hire people to build bitcoin apps. If they don't altcoiners will eat their lunch.

Without privacy humans are finished. They will be turned into rating chasing artificial beings, driven by fear of losing some points. 
Forget about experimentation, self discovery and creativity. All will be just a calculated attempt to maximize "trust" and probably outsourced to some number crunching, optimal decision making app. 
You'll become absolutely controlled by apps. If you won't follow machine recommendations you eventually get a badge of shame and be ostracized. This is "info-eugenics" type of nightmare some useful idiots are welcoming with open arms.

Bitcoin market value is instrumental for keeping the network secure. 
Instead of working on making bitcoin better and making it more valuable and secure, the "flippining" get-rich-quick schemers decided to manufacture endless supply of new units of account.
To answer your question, working on alts instead of making bitcoin better (decentralized apps, microtransactions, better fungibility) is an attack on bitcoin security.
It serves greed not greater purpose, which is understandable and all too human.

You need a LN enabled app that blocks all unidentified callers by default. Unblocks the call if the caller pays. If you talk to the caller for X amount of time the caller gets bitcoin back. Could be the first LN killer app.
**EDIT:** The same principle can probably be used in LN enabled email/messaging apps. Filter out all unidentified contacts. If people you don't know want to contact you then they must pay you bitcoin. If you open the message they get that amount of bitcoin back.

No, altcoins are just get-rich-quick schemes by those who feel that they missed the bitcoin train.
Around 60% of market share belongs to bitcoin is parked in altcoins.
Competent devs, marketers and tech savy users chose to work and promote altcoins in an attempt to kill the greatest innovation of our time.

Isn't bitcoin uses as much energy as Ireland today? Multiply it by say 100 and see how sustainable it would be for the planet.


What about "hyperbitcoinization" and irrational exuberance.
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:34:40
LN is the first step towards replacing POW with POS. Mining is unsustainable when the price of 1 btc is more than million $. We don't need bitcoin to consume all planetary resources. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:20:11
I might be completely wrong here but if "hyperbitcoinization" happens in the next decade or so it is hard to see how mining will be sustainable. A significant amount of planetary resources will be devoted towards POW.
