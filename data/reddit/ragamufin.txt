GDAX is coinbase.
Moving from GDAX to a private wallet will cost you a TX fee around 30 bucks.
These folks are right that if you are okay letting coinbase hold your money for you it isn't that expensive.  I do not trust coinbase or any exchange to babysit my money.  Every major bitcoin theft has been an exchange hack.

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 950 satoshis/byte.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 214,700 satoshis.
That's like $26 bucks a transaction right?
So the suggestion above is to do 2k buy in 10 transactions, which is $260 in fees or &gt;10% of your investment in transaction fees.

Ah but you keep the bitcoin on coinbase?  That's the missing link here for me. I always move my BTC off of there as soon as possible so splitting transactions up like this over time would be very expensive.  I don't think it's a good idea to keep your bitcoin on coinbase. Isn't the whole point that you don't have to trust centralized, private institutions to hold your money?

that would be a fine strategy if the transaction costs on bitcoin weren't absurdly high.
A 2k buy in 10 transactions would involve spending more than 10% of your investment in transaction fees alone.

How is that possible? Movement of bitcoin from one address to another must be written to the blockchain.  Writing it to the blockchain requires a transaction fee.  Somebody has to pay the miners to process the transaction into the next block.  Who is paying for the transaction to be processed?

But you have to send it unless you want to let the exchange hold it for you which history shows is a horrible idea.  I guess you could dollar cost average over a few days then transfer the full balance though
