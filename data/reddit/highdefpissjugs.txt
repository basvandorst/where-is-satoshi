Do you trade arbitrage opportunities? I've noticed coinbase seems to have higher prices than other sites. Right now BTC is about $500 higher on there than Kraken. I'm wondering if the fees would eat up any profit you would have from buying on Kraken or Gemini, transferring to coinbase, and then selling there.

Nothing goes up forever in the long term. There will be a dip at some point. It's inevitable.

It touched 3200 and is going back up. Hoping that's it.

But the stock market being at an all time high can't be a bubble. Stocks are backed by a real company with buildings and assets and things!!!
Except that stock entitles you to none of those and if that company files bankruptcy then your claim to those things are at the bottom of the list after the banks, inside investors, preferred shareholders, and other creditors liquidate those assets.

Acceptance would be great but we don't want anyone to except to them.

I mean when you eventually withdraw in retirement. Let's say Bitcoin takes off like we're hoping and you see a massive gain with GBTC, for example. You're leaving a lot of money on the table in taxes when you go to pull it out. The offset to that is with a 401k you're getting employer contributions and reducing your taxable income in the present.
Compare that to a Roth IRA where you aren't getting taxed in retirement. I would rather hold anything Bitcoin related in a Roth IRA. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:06:08
The difference is how they're taxed. With a traditional IRA or 401k, the money you deposit reduces your income that you can be taxed on for the year but then you get taxed on that money when you withdraw it in retirement. If you make $35k this year and put $5k into an IRA then you pay income taxes on $30k. 
A Roth IRA is the opposite. The money you deposit is included in your income you're taxed on but then you aren't taxed on it when you withdraw. 
So say you buy $20k worth of a Bitcoin fund over your lifetime and Bitcoin takes off so the fund is worth $10 million in 40 years. Would you rather get taxed on $20k now or $10 million in the future?
And that can really apply to any asset, not just Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:32:12
Dude I gotta ask, what are the logistics of selling that much Bitcoin? Do you get an accountant involved? Do you just withdraw it to a checking account?
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:41:07
But a 401k or traditional IRA gets taxed when withdrawn. Roth IRA would be better

Yeah i am. Our so called leaders have been fucking up for a long time with no repurcussions. Their actions have real negative consequences on your and my lives. How much better could our lives be if our so called representatives worked in our interest instead of for whoever pays them the most money? And this has been happening for decades. We're only becoming aware of it now because of the internet. Take a step back from the horse and pony show and look at the insanity of it all. I'm not calling for violence or saying anyone needs to be killed because I'm hoping it will get better once the boomers start retiring from government  but in the meantime i don't have one ounce of sadness for anyone who catches a bullet like that snake congressman. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:20:10
Well this is why people are snapping and gunning down congressmen.

A distaste I certainly have. I thought Clinton was just as awful of a candidate. I honestly couldn't choose between either of them. You have one who publicly embarrasses the country and himself on a regular basis but whom I'm hoping is so incompetent and polarizing that he won't do too much long term damage or you have one who is dug in deep enough to actually make moves in the government and slick enough to sell us out behind our back while we thank her for it.
