I’ve been waiting for verification for almost a week ☹️
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:25:28
Fuck man, really? I’m guessing support hasn’t emailed you back either?
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:11:15
I’ve been waiting two weeks. -_-

Answer is no. Hold on and let it recover, especially if you’re selling at a loss.

It’s been almost two for me

I’ve been waiting for verification to invest in XRP for two weeks now. I’m so pissed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:28
Yeah, I’d say now was the time to invest. Personally, I prefer litecoin, but bitcoin is the safer bet typically.

How long for verification on Binance though? If it takes weeks then it’s not any more viable than waiting for Bitstamp.

I’m out almost a 1000. Sad times, might as well stay like a sunk cost fallacy. HODL till I make a profit.

Can I send BTC from Coinbase to an unverified Binance account or do I have to wait for verification?

I’m pretty new to this, but what about Bitcoin Cash and XRP? Aren’t they centralized? With implementation of BCH on Coinbase, and their plans to implement XRP; is it crazy that they might try to push for centralized currency? 
Wasn’t Coinbase just bought by Fidelity as well? I’m a little suspicious of all this coming together, but I admit that these are all speculation.

I had something similar happen when I tried to pay my gf through Venmo for a trip we took to “Cuba.” It’s just flaging the transaction due to our trade embargo we have on the country itself.

Depends on whose crash you’re talking about. If you got in and invested in ethereum before November, it be all profits.
