Awesome post. I share some of the feelings expressed in this post with respect to my interning at Armory.
Definitely an awesome time to be alive.

I can only speak about Debian and Ubuntu. Of course the difficulty varies based on what distro you choose.
First of all there were some issues with the makefiles in Armory, where some of the generated files would not be removed when make clean runs. This resulted in errors when trying to build Armory twice using Debian tools. So before doing anything else, I worked with upstream to get those issues resolved. Those issues aren't a problem if you use a clean chroot everytime you rebuild, but I don't so it was an issue.
Lets start with Debian. You start out by filing a RFP (Request for Package) if you want to see a piece of software in Debian, but are unable to or unwilling to package the software yourself. You file an ITP (Intent to Package) if you intend to package the software yourself. I go into more detail in [this post](
Then once someone files an ITP they follow the procedures in [The Debian New Maintainers' Guide]( This involves taking the upstream tarball, running a command to make a debian directory, and populating the autogenerated files in that debian directory. Once you are done you try building the package with dpkg-buildpackage. One of the harder parts was the [debian/copyright file]( which must list all the copyrights of the files in Armory. So it is not just the technical aspects of packaging that can be difficult.
Most of the work I did was in the patches I made to the Debian version of Armory. You can inspect them [here]( It was tricky to remove the convenience copies of code (which are the libraries that Armory ships with). For Debian you are supposed to replace them with the libraries that Debian ships. It was tricky because Armory was my first package, so I didn't know quite the right way to do it.
It took me from filing the ITP at the beginning of June to the end of October to get Armory into Debian, but not all of that time was spent working on Armory. I am not a Debian Developer, so I needed a sponsor (who is a Debian Developer) to get Armory into Debian. So some time was spent waiting on a sponsor. Then when I got a sponsor I worked with him for a while on Armory and he was very helpful, but he eventually became busy with his real life job. So in the end it was a second sponsor who uploaded Armory. Also, during the period where I was working with the first sponsor, [this happened]( which made me wait for the next release, which took a while. Also there is a New Queue that all new Debian packages must go through to be reviewed. So it was around October 7 or 9 when Armory entered the New Queue. So most of October was spent just waiting for Armory to be approved.
So it took five months, but it would have taken a lot less if everything lined up better.
Ubuntu is very easy, because if you get your package into Debian, it will automatically sync to Debian. There are also other ways to get packages in Ubuntu, but I am not familiar with them.
Wow that was long.

Hi again,
It looks like Armory actually won't be staying in Ubuntu for the Vivid release. Ubuntu doesn't have an equivalent of Debian unstable. The development release of Ubuntu becomes the stable release. Once Vivid is actually released, it would be hard to release new versions of Armory. Armory would get out of date and there could potentially be bugs from using old versions of Armory with newer versions of Bitcoin Core. Hopefully one day either Armory will be stable enough, or distro update policies will be changed, so that Armory can be in Ubuntu.
I could probably setup an Ubuntu PPA for Armory if it would help you or others. That way I can keep it up-to-date with the newest version of Armory.

Maybe because resolving .bit domain names requires special software to be installed and/or the changing of DNS settings, which not everyone is going to do. So it probably comes down to ease of access for the average person.
Now why don't more companies use .bit domain names in addition to their usual domain name, I don't know.
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:56:07
It does not mean that Bitcoin-Core would have to be in the same repositories as Armory. Armory doesn't technically need bitcoind to run, but most people running Armory would also want to run bitcoind, because Armory is pretty useless on its own. Therefore, Armory lists the bitcoind package as a recommended package, not a dependency. So Armory will still install without Bitcoin-Core.
This allows someone to install the Bitcoin-Core binaries, or build from source and use it in conjunction with Armory from the Debian repos.
I will admit that it does kind of defeat the purpose of providing a convenient method of installing Armory through Debian if the user has to go download Bitcoin-Core from a website.
Bitcoin-Core is only in unstable. There is a [release-critical bug blocking Bitcoin-Core from migrating to testing]( because the maintainers want to prevent Bitcoin-Core from entering stable, which would make it difficult to provide timely updates to Bitcoin-Core.
The reason that Armory will be in stable is that it uses Bitcoin-Core to do all communication with the Bitcoin network. So I don't have the same concerns that the Bitcoin-Core Debian maintainers have where bugs in the Debian version of Bitcoin-Core can cause network consensus issues.
@_date: 2014-07-30 12:06:07
Yep, I'm working on it and the plan is to get it into the Debian repos. (Of course it will start out in unstable, migrate to testing, and then end up in stable eventually)

I'm sure I never entered my email before. I just started up a browser I never use and got the deals again.

Note that right now you are not able to install Armory from the Debian archive if you are running stable (Wheezy) or testing (Jessie).
The text from my post over on BitcoinTalk Forums:














In addition it appears that Armory has synced to Ubuntu Vivid, the development release which will be released in April. So if you are running Ubuntu, you will also be able to install Armory.

All these posts about electrum, and no one is posting about Armory?

I don't know about i18n in Armory. I am just the maintain of Armory for Debian. I am unaffiliated with Armory Techologies Inc. That would be a question for them.

It's not something I'm going to do right now, since I have some more work to do to get basic Namecoin support. Namecoin is a lot easier than Litecoin, because Namecoin shares more similarities with Bitcoin than Litecoin does. In particular, Litecoin uses scrypt as PoW, so that would probably complicate things.
Note that I am just contributing to Armory, I'm not actually affiliated with Armory Technologies, Inc. (ATI)
If you or someone else who knows C++ and Python wants to add Litecoin support, then go for it (you should probably let ATI know beforehand, so that they are aware). I can answer questions about the Armory codebase. I think ATI is busy with other stuff, so unless someone comes along and programs other altcoin support, it probably won't happen anytime soon.

I agree it is hard to read. Chrome is better than Firefox for me. In Firefox some of the boxes are too small, but in Chrome they are all the same height.

I see them when I go to that page. No email necessary.

As the other person said, there is bitcoinj. There is a [coding conventions guide]( There is also MultiBit, which is built on top of bitcoinj.
Armory uses a mix of C++ and Python. Bitcoin Core itself uses C++ as do altcoin clients that are forked from Bitcoin Core, like Namecoin.

Jeremy Rand, Namecoin Lead Application Engineer, recently posted [a Reddit comment]( about the security issues with using an extension like this that relies on a centralized service like dotbit.me.

At least Newegg seems to have their own special readable page.

Debian package for Armory coming soon!

Pick a piece of software you like and start contributing!
I am working on adding Namecoin support to Armory. I also maintain Armory in Debian.
I also know that the Namecoin folks could use a lot of help.

Not part of the Armory team (though they are being helpful and are also interested in seeing a package in the Debian repos). "Just" a dev who wants to see Armory in Debian.

I don't think it had the falling snow last year, and I think it was split into categories to make browsing easier.

Does anyone know what time zone the Newegg deals that start at a specific time are in?

By default, in online mode, Armory will try to run Bitcoin Core in the background.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:01:51
It looks like it is already part of Ubuntu Vivid which is scheduled to be released in April. That was done automatically by getting Armory in Debian. I will have to look into seeing if it is possible to get Armory into earlier versions of Ubuntu. I am not too familiar with how Ubuntu development works.

I am working on [NMControl for Android]( which is a version of NMControl designed to run on Android.
If you don't know, [NMControl]( is Python software that connects to a namecoind instance and sets up an RPC server and DNS server. You could, for example, point your computer's DNS settings to that DNS server, so that you can resolve .bit domain names.
Right now Namecoin for Android isn't particularly useful. First, there is no lite client for Android, so you need to connect to a remote namecoind instance, for example, one running on a computer on your local network. Two, Android can only connect to DNS servers running on port 53. To run a server on port 53, you need to be root. So without root, NMControl for Android is useless in it's particular state.
There are plans to integrate a proxy server into NMControl itself. You could then, for example, use Firefox for Android with NMControl for Android even if you are not running root. It would work the same way Orbot works without root.

A career website.

is right. A lot of companies, especially small companies (like a lot of Bitcoin-related companies are), don't explicitly advertise for interns, but if you can show them that there is an upside to hiring you as an intern, they may.
You also have to keep in mind that "requirements" are often what the company would like to get, not what they will realistically be able to get given the various factors that come into play during an employee search. So don't be discouraged just because you don't meet every single requirement the job listing says, especially if it is just an internship position.
My current internship wasn't explicitly advertised. Rather I went the "show them what you can offer" route and an internship developed from there.
And don't worry too much about the fact that you don't feel like you can offer much as a second semester CS student. You'll develop, even just from what you learn in class if nothing else, and there will be companies looking for interns at the point you feel that you are ready for internships (even if they don't happen to be Bitcoin-related companies).
