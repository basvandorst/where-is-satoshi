I wonder if the law enforcement is actually on your tail for having a username like that

Bitcoin does not neccesaryly need to be the 1 solution that does it all. if it does the basics, ie. a sound digital token, the market can build the more advanced features on top. I have no problem with this, since on a global level competition is free enough, that we likely wont see giant corporations doing everything bitcoin related. There will be startups big and small trying new things all the time. Even tho there is bitlicence in New York. Thats probably the 1 place they wont be.

I dont know how he does it, but i think in this case he tried to guess the password with the help of hints from OP. Simply giving Dave an encrypted wallet is probably not enough.

You are not really helping the cause by censoring yourself

For something like bitcoin, it may be open-source, but its not a benefit for it to fork, since in the end the goal is to have a global ledger. Not two, or 3, or whatever. But if the market choses to fork bitcoin, and suddenly there is 2 or more blockchains, so be it.

I wonder if the court will pay any attention to how this will affect the price of bitcoin if they sell them on the open exchange. Doing that they may end up getting significantly less that otherwise possible. Perhaps they will auction them.

This XT buisness has been terrible for bitcoin. Devs being impatient is the last thing we need. Bitcoin may be anti-frigile, robust, but it still a sensitive system in the end. I feel like Hearn and Gavin are rushing things, and now we have the actual potential for a fork. They cause unnecesary uncertantiy and doubt, when in reality it is not urgent to raise the block size. Other than that there is also crammed other stuff into BitcoinXT which may or may not be properly thought through and or tested. On top of that, it only requires 75% consensus to switch, all in all I cannot believe they thought this would be a good idea.
By the way that was an allright article from the MSM.

It would probably be a good idea to allow talk about any crypto-currency on Barring the ones that are pump and dump or scams, except that the comments sections probably will contain enough information about such things. So i dont think it will be irresponsible to take a more laid back approach when it comes to alt-coin talk here.

You are saying there could be two Apples?
@_date: 2015-04-23 09:30:21
Agreed. Dont try too hard. Dont waste other peoples time (and your own). Ive only had positive results when ive kept it short and on point, like you said.
The only thing i will ad is if you can point them in the right direction, ie. bitpay or coinbase, or coinify if you are in europe, or any other bitcoin payment processor you can recommend:)

There have been two bubbles in the past. Or 3. Back then there was even less incentive to use Bitcoin than today. Certainly the infrastructure was much less developed. Said in another way, there doesent need to be a incentive to use bitcoin over dollars, for a bubble to form. There have been bubbles in other commodities as well, or whatever you want to call it. Beanie babies, and tulips. It doesent have to be rational.

That sounds very good

Why do you want to sacrifice innovation for consumer protection? There must be a better solution

If you had asked 50 years ago if it was feassable for bread to cost $10 and not 10 cent then theyd probably say no. But i think thats where we have arrived today.

It's probably because they don't want to be viewed as a shadow bank. I don't think giving someone 10 million euros in cash is going to look good on your official resume due to the whole guilty until proven otherwise when it comes to cash transactions. Fuck the war on terror and drugs Which is starting to take over our financial system.

I dont think you replied to a vague post. I thought it was specific. A good way to get the entrepenours attention is to mention you would like the option to pay with bitcoin.

What are the benefits of a Trezor for example over a software wallet like Electrum?
@_date: 2015-04-24 13:55:56


Why do you need an alt-coin for this?
