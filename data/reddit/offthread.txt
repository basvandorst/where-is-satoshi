You tired to use bitcoin recently? I don't think you have.  
When purchasing something I click a link, it opens my wallet, I type a password, hit confirm, re-type the password and then it's done.  At no point did I need to do anything that I would consider a hassle.   
At a store I pick a store from a list, an amount and then I have the gift card.  When at the cashier I show them a bar-code, they scan it and the price updates.  Simple really. Most banks will be going this route with your debit card in the future anyway.  I hope you survive. 
It's less steps than taking out your wallet and typing out all those silly numbers that can easily be stolen.

Today we traded $5,306,860,000 in Bitcoin.  I certainly didn't spend that much; but the some total of your "30 people" did??  Damn billionaires spending billions everyday. You're figure is vastly off as it's already adopted by many communities around the world.

You can buy plenty of sandwiches with bitcoin now actually.  There are dozens of gift card distributors that accept bitcoin. You can buy virtually anything with bitcoin now a days. Shit just go to craigslist and check off "cryptocurrency ok".

People mad cause this is the answer that they refuse to believe.  You can buy anything you want with bitcoin now; they're delirious.

That's very possible actually.   I do it all the time.

 Say you were not so short sighted and bought Bitcoin a few years ago, then you would have many Bitcoin for many sandwich shops.   Some people actually think of the future and not just the moment.

How is giving people with existing bitcoin access to hundreds of storefronts with pay-by phone system "pretending it better"?  That IS BETTER.  You're acting short sighted to make a stupid outdated point.  Stop making up all this extra bullshit trying to pretend that someone is thinking *today I buy bitcoin and today I buy a gift card to go shopping.*  That's DUMB, DUH.    
These aservices are for the people UNLIKE you who already HAVE bitcoin and need ways of spending it.  Everyone who has bitcoin don't give a fuck what you people think as we have the cashier scan out phones. 
I don't take out my wallet.
I don't spend an of the fiat I have in the bank.
I have absolutely risk of someone stealing my credit card number; it's not used.
I have no risk of identity theft as none of it is linked to my identity.  
The cashier scans a bar-card on my phone so I feel futuristic too. 
Please take your head out of the sand.

While good; get ready to deal with... people... used items instead of new, incorrect item types, and canceled orders have all happened to me.
