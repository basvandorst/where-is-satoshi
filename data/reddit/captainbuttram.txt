In history, when the market crashes people run to thing like gold that will hold value. I believe bitcoin will be the new gold and people will be buying bitcoin with their exceedingly useless dollars. Stop taking things so personally you little downvote Nancy

No you want your GDP to grow that's what tells you the economy is actually in an uptrend.

How is it shallow? That I want what's best for the user? I'm saying these companies DO NOT have bitcoin or users in their best interest. ALL they see is $$$$.
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:42:06
Yes and this autonomous corporation is so groundbreaking because it isn't influenced by corruption or greed, it can't be bribed or fooled. This is the advantage.
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:32:56
And you're right greed is good in some sectors, but for bitcoin, do you really think a central mining authority is good? What if big banking put the squeeze on big mining? Would bitcoin collapse or would it just be easier for the average user to mine? I am for decentralizing because there are a lot of very rich people who stand to lose money from bitcoins success and I would hate to see bitcoin defeated in this way.

When the time comes to sell.. I won't have to

I'd say agree upon a price of bitcoin at the time of deal 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:11:16
Look at GDP of US since recession. It's stagnant. We're being propped up by spending money we don't really have.

You are blinding yourself because of emotion, if you don't think politicians are just doing their donors bidding, then there is nothing I can say to convince you. You will have to find out yourself. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:37:25
Yea so?

Who makes the guns? Military industrial complex. 
Who warmongers? Military industrial complex. 
How does a politician become powerful? Money.
Who has all the money? Corporations.
You think a politician takes millions from a corporation to get elected, and then they get into office and now have power over the corporation? You are greatly mistaken my friend.

So corporation have infinite greed right it's what they do, they profit. Currently the bigger the mining operation you have the more you profit you get. This will lead to mining corps being created so that can create massive mining ops. What do you believe greed will lead to?
