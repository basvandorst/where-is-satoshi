It's already gone under $200 as I predicted on 3 major exchanges, but I'm pretty sure it has much further to fall, as it hasn't fallen below ~$400 on Bitstamp yet. 
People are also still operating with the belief that Bitcoin is not in a bubble, and are scapegoating MtGox for everything rather than realizing (perhaps they simply deny) the real explanation.
One thing is almost certain: The price won't start going wildly up again anytime soon. Just look at other historical examples of bubbles. Even previous Bitcoin bubbles. Once the price crashes, that's when the long grueling sideways-trend of despair begins.

That talks about decentralization of data, but how would you get fiat into a decentralized exchange exactly?
How would you escrow fiat in a decentralized way?

No I did not, but if you have evidence of that (i.e. a link to the post) then go ahead and present it.
My prediction was originally stated as this: 'Bitcoin will go to $200 or less before ever reaching $1242 again'
Realizing this could be interpreted to mean that the price will someday again reach $1242, I later added and repeated with it: '..if it ever does that is'
I have also stated that in the end, Bitcoin is going to zero.
