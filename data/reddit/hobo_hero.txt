You got source for that IQ, I find that harder to believe than most of the conspiracy theories

Always follow this advice, especially when dealing with things like bitcoin. I've got back ups of all my bitcoin stuff stored between my in a my pc, a deposit box and a buried safebox (It's buried treasure). I need to access two of the locations to be able to send any money just to make sure no one can steal anything. If we're gonna have have bitcoin become mainstream then people need to be better educated about proper security of digital assets.

Use altcoins as an example of how the bitcoin protocol is open source and anyone can view and change it

You should give some examples of what you can buy with it and where you can aswell

I heard about bitcoin in particular on a podcast called Security Now, sparked my interest when anyone could of mined them with their gpu. Then I stupidly ignored bitcoin for a couple of years, I wish I had brought back then :(

Sounds awesome, I'm not sure if I got in time for the free BTC but I signed up for the happiness prescription anyway. I've been looking for something to do with my Bitcoins anyway.
Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm wondering if using the kudos points you get to get new prescriptions would be as effective as paying or if it would be more comparable to paying nothing.
Edit: Also is the one placebo locked to local time or USA time?

Definitely compare a bitcoin transaction to an international bank transfer in terms of cost and time

Also I don't think half the BTC in existence is in exchanges ready to be brought
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:24:56
So it helps the exchange then?

Yeah someone with an IQ like that would probably be doing a bit more than running an exhange
