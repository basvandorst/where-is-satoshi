It's on the drawing board but no official word yet. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:02:08
Thanks!  Stay tuned for Canada!
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:24:25
As a leader in technology it's important for us to set an example.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:39:07
Gift cards, no cash or btc refunds. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:37:45
Stay tuned!
Edit: You can use the US site and ship to Canada!
Edit  Working on a few kinks... we'll post an update as soon as we can.  Our apologies!
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:45:23
Good to hear a satisfied customer!  Thanks for shopping with us!
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:19:22
Indeed it is Bitpay!
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:44:18
Another TigerDirect Bitcoin initiative is now live!
We have them in stock and ready to ship! (limited quantity available)
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:36:53
Thank You!!!
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:33:19
Thanks for the feedback.  We noticed this issue appearing with early bitcoin orders.  It has now been resolved and an invoice will not be sent.  Please disregard this one.
Sorry about the confusion!
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:47:49
Hey OP, please send me your order number. I want to take a look at this for you. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:59:24
Glad to hear it! Happy shopping, friend.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:32:12
One tiger sized duck we'll kick'em right in the bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:40:39
Hey! We're already there under the name [Misco](
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:25:19
Ask and you shall receive. Changed!
Yeah, we had digital on our official press release as well.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:11:07
We have exclusive promotions for Bitcoin customers periodically. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 12:17:12
Did you have a negative experience with our store? If so we'd like to hear about it. Any feedback we can obtain to better our customer experience is welcomed with open arms.

We love you too, Skydive.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:44:47
TigerDirect prides itself in being a leader in technology; accepting Bitcoin is just another way to exemplify this. We've created a page from our initial Bitcoin launch to help those that do not understand how to currency functions. [Check it out](
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:26:47
We welcome you with open arms :) 
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:03:33
We're not allowed to discuss since we're a publicly traded company. However we believe other retailers haven't adopted due to a lack of understanding of the currency.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:13:58
Things We Like - 
1. It's exciting technology 2. We believe in the concept and where it's going 3. You guys use it.
Things We Don't Like - Nothing.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:26:18
Thanks for the questions guys! We enjoyed answering them. We're heading out to lunch now but we'll come back in a few hours to answer any stragglers out there. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:10:23
Hey OP, send me your order number so I can take a look at whats going on here.. Sorry for the delay, just saw your notification. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:21:47
We have sales exclusively for our Bitcoin customers periodically! Be on the look out for them. Subscribe to our mailing list.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:18:23
This should be updated soon.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:56:52
No, luckily for us most of our web dev team are miners themselves! A few meetings with Bitpay and we rolled it out. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:06:02
Online, but see question from ero79
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:40:50
Enjoy your stay, Cab00se.
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:15:35
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:42:13
Yes! Someone asked this same question a while ago. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:05:10
How to treat the accounts before payment. Our credit orders are a bit different since we receive payment upfront. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:19:34
Sorry for the misinformation provided.  The Bitcoin promotion is actually for the entire site.
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:46:07
You're welcome very much.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:33:30
Which do you think? We're here, we've heard you guys loud and clear and we're working hard at providing :) Thanks for the heads up on the typo! 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:01:25
HOW DOES RIGHT NOW SOUND?? [Link to TigerDirect.CA](
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:07:39
Fair enough. Thank you for sharing your feedback with us, and I'm sorry to hear we weren't able to resolve the matter to your satisfaction. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:23:18

YES! We do Canada.

3dfx Voodoo Banshee 16MB, the good ol' days of Quake. Thanks lolwerds we're happy to be a part of the BTC community. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:02:27
Well... The ones we do hold were spending on trips to space, buying Teslas, floor seats to Kings games, and buying all the 50 Cent albums we can get our hands on!
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:34:17
1. Refunds are only provided in the form of a TigerDirect gift card. No refunds in CASH or BTC. 
2. It's an idea.
3. Not at the moment, but perhaps in the future. Getting other vendors/retailers to adapt the new currency might prove difficult. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:49:39
We have the systems physically in our warehouse and ready to ship!
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:19:15
Hey there, just logged in and saw your message. Forwarding to our care managers now. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:19:56
Can you send us your order number? We'll look into it. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:23:27
Sorry for the issues with your order.  I'd like to help out.  PM Sent!
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:24:42
Yeah... that's a shame.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:30:35
Yes.. You can!! [Buy a Tiger with Bitcoin](
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:30:36
Yup, edited this.  We had digital on our official press release as well. :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:35:03
Yes. We've noticed an increase in new customers since accepting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:18:39
If you didn't pay within the 15 minutes the order will be canceled, and you'll have to replace it. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:34:01
Good catch! Sending this over to my web team now.
Also, great to hear we've moved up in your book.  :D
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:42:02
As we said, we have a ton of projects on the drawing board, but we don't have any official statement as to when or if we'll be implementing Bitcoin in Europe. As always, Reddit will be the FIRST to know about it as soon as we go live :) 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:03:48
Come on man, we did that like 2 minutes ago!! Visit tigerdirect.ca
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:28:48
Graphic cards and other mining equipment.  Since bitcoin has dipped it's now more luxury items such as TVs, Tablets, PCs, and More!
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:44:19
USD, only for BTC transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:34:55
Phase 1 complete.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:03:25
Our number one goal is to make our customers happy, the sentiment across the board has been overwhelmingly positive. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:47:49
We &lt;3 you.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:05:37
We're rolling this out in phases in order to align with the right partners and use the best tech.  Retail is on the roadmap.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:38:08
At the moment we offer exclusive sales aimed at Bitcoin consumers periodically. These sales will save you more than the 1-2% in CC fees. You needed a new router anyways, right?
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:42:43
[Androids, anyone?](
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:29:13
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:56:30
We are all VERY excited.  Reddit is the first online community to hear the news.
