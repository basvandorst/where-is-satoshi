The block itself is made up of transactions.  Once the block is full the miners collectively "solve" the block which authenticates all the transactions within it.  The miners are paid the fees for their work solving the block.

If "many many" transactions are performed outside the bitcoin network then the security of the bitcoin network will be undermined, no?
Also, if this sort of scaling takes place, what will that mean for the btc mining industry? If lightning means less transactions in the btc network surely that is going to reduce mining revenue.

Fees are dependent on the number of transactions trying to join the block.  The more people transacting, the greater the competition to be included in the block. The higher the fee the greater the chance of being included in the block.

The more people transacting the more fees there are in the pot.  Meaning lots of people transacting leads to higher numbers of miners.  Higher numbers of miners decreases the profitability of mining (smaller piece of the pie) therefore the relative cost of mining goes up.  Which in turn puts upward pressure on the fees once again.  When the fees go up, the price of bitcoin goes up.  Higher fees mean that demand is high.

Yeah sorry that was a leap away from your article.  Just building upon these two great points you bring up:




We can not form a social consensus that more gold will be born into existence.  THAT is part of what makes it a true store of wealth, it's scarcity is guaranteed.
Great post OP.

So essentially with less mining capacity the fees go up?

You haven't offered a solution to the problem he's reiterating, if it's such an outdated question, why don't you provide the answer?


How has the issue been solved?  Please enlighten me (for real, if you can.)

If the mining capacity goes down while the user base goes up, either you pay top dollar to participate in the block or you wait a long, long time.  This sort of thing already happens when there's a high number of people transacting on the network.


So bitcoin is just as useless as paper money during a calamity.  That's not a pro-btc statement.

That is not an adequate response.  Part of bitcoin's security depends on making transactions difficult to reverse.  
Andreas' answer is typical of a true believer:  Faith that in the future, we'll figure it out.  Don't worry about it.

I agree with you.  "Digital gold" implies that bitcoin's value is in storing wealth, when in fact it is supposed to be a currency.  It can't be both at the same time.

Any technology that allows for the reversal of btc transactions is in fact undermining one of btc's core security features, that being the computational impracticality of reversing transactions.

This same reasoning has been used during every bubble in the past 100 years.

Very well written thanks for the read!  Especially liked this part 


This is a huge challenge when it comes to increasing bitcoin's value as a true currency.  If transactions are irreversible people lose trust in the system when they are scammed.  Imagine if Amazon didn't guarantee every purchase on it's site.  People would stop using Amazon.
