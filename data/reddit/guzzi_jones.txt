I was thinking by using a unique bitcoin price you could eliminate the upc all together.  The main problem i see here is the customer who scans an item and then decides they want to "return" it.

dude you kidding? stay far away from that place.

agreed.  once multisig is added the protocal will be adopted a lot more.
edit: i accept your downvotes as a badge of honor.

damn!  how well does it work?  I have been looking for something like this for coinbase

I read the sidebar and that gave it away for me.  Totally misses the whole point of bitcoin.  It makes it seem like some CRAZY internet money and is NOT professional at all.

if it makes you feel better my wedding ring got stolen last wednesday.  so not only am it out that, but i am in the dooooggg house.  :)

I have commented before as well that the sidebar is too biased

Btc is an asset. It is taxed as such with capital gains taxes. Yes it is legal

don't forget litecoin. It is the second most popular coin.   you will need to go full tech though and install the client. make sure you only install it on a linux box.
message me if you want help with this.  maybe we could do a gotomeeting.

the fees on bitstamp are higher than coin base to buy bitcoin with fiat.  this cuts into the price.  Then there is the added fee from your bank to wire them the money.  unless you already have money in bitstamp arbitrage is difficult without significant amount of cash.
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:19:39
Yes we should come up with a decentralized currency with zero fees and encryption so this never happens again
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:47:22
looks pretty tough to get USD into bitstamp.  Coinbase is a lot easier , thus the price is higher.

Great work so far.  lets show them that we care more about the people of WA than a Nascar race!

Well written sir.

Thanks for the clarity.  poorbutalive must be in on it.

correct, malwarebytes is the best free one i know of.  no bloatware.  take it as a lesson learned and use it as a positive.  I just posted a text post asking for tips on how to best secure a software wallet.  I agree this is the future.
Ubuntu is free and stable.  At this point in its lifetime if offers most software equivalents to windows.  Give it a shot if your up for it.  Most drivers are built in to the software.

appreciate your comment.  I truly believe  bitcoin will change the world for the better. THANKS!

In my experience i have found that Bitcoin could potentially remove "friction" of donations.  I was just watching a fundraiser for PBS last night and thinking "why don't they just put a QR code on the screen for donations".  Spare yourself the effort of a call center and having to take personal information.  Just give us a show! The block chain address should be enough verification for tax purposes.
edit: LTC and BTC are both legit coins that are proven IMO.
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:22:15
Ur donation page for bit coin is a pop up.  It is causing issues on mobile. Just make it a regular href link. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 01:32:41
let these guys know they should accept bitcoin if they want to fight for the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:38:17
 buy from coin base, transfer to a local wallet on android or linux distro.  secure and backup your local wallet.  have a backup at work and home.
@_date: 2014-06-15 23:59:32
it opens up the possibility to giving CC to users who otherwise wouldn't be able to.  Like in foreign countries where access to credit is slim.
1 of 1 would probably be best.

sounds like a classic key logger.  If your going to use bitcoin, make sure your on android and linux

Something seems off.  This is too easy. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:14:32
Right I believe there is a niche need for it but a don't know enough about the current system in place. Essentially it would be giving someone a prefilled wallet with a promise to pay back. A marked set of coins may do the trick.  I love the trolls here.  U seem to be  one with a positive approach to solving problems
