I got my bitcoin cash via the coinbase airdrop. My issue will i get taxed on the price it was when it showed up in my account or when it was accredited to me via the actual blockchain release. If its when coinbase releaed it then i am in for a huge bill. No one seems to have a clear answer for this

You gotta think the winklevoss brothers are probable first in line to secure as many of these as possible . They already have the experience with buying large amounts.

Even in the best case scenario of hold bitcoin for over a year before realizing gains . If it is taxed as a capital gain and you have to pay the 15% tax rate in the us. That is going to have a major impact on the usefulness of bitcoin for buying goods and services on top of any sales tax that applies in the future. After reading the post on the tax process of bitcoin I am a little more confused on bitcoin as anything other then a long term investment hold right now. Using it day to day can be very expensive from a tax perspective.
