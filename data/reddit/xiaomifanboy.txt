You hodlers should have fucking sold when it was crashing and bought more when the crash was over instead of being happy about loosing money.

What do you think will happen to the price when the Segwit implementation happens next week?

Is there a way to accurately know how much space a transaction takes up in a block?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:03:57
Then it just be the same as bcash 
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:40:42
Will that having lead to much higher fees to keep it profitable for miners?
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:00:46
Great. Does anyone know if the Transaction fees will be higher or lower than paying by card.

(Panicking) Bitcoin forecasts saying it's about to drop. Should I sell now or HODL?

Be careful with those secure facilities. In South Africa earlier this year a bank got robbed off all its safety deposit boxes.

What does FUD mean?
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:38:07
I think that it's that people are getting increasingly worried about Bitcoin be banned.

@_date: 2017-09-19 18:00:53
Someone please explain to me what all this means.

More chance of the rand strengthening than this succeeding 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:39:14
Just a website that uses past performance to work out the future price
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:50:40
As long as it's not 8MB.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:02:04
Damn that's funny

How do you know that China will ban Bitcoin mining. It's a good way of bringing money into the country.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:22:36
Entering the lottery right away! Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:34:03
Bad news for Bitcoin. This is the beginning of the end for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:21:54
Someone isn't affected by the economy.
