Well it means something to some people but the actual joke is meta. You have to understand it to get it. Someone who just reads a comment would have no idea why it's funny no matter what the context was unless they were in on the joke. 
I live in Australia so I didn't go to the rally in NYC. But I was on reddit during the rally and it was very quiet. 
After the rally there were all sorts of posts about waffles upvoted to the front page so that we could all comment "Waffles, don't you mean carrots? HAHAHA". 
The people who were at the rally caught on pretty quick.. Since most of them were probably redditing on their mobiles the whole time anyway. Great idea tho.

Unless you got the transaction ID whilst it was processing you will need to send your coins to another address and get the TID for that and check block chain. 
It's probably a security feature so your coins aren't stored in a hot wallet but stored in a secure wallet on the coinjar site. Then when you send coins somewhere else the coin jar server organises everything for you. 
I've never had an issue with coinjar so I'm confident you actually received what you paid for. 
Maybe a coinjar admin who watches this subreddit has a method you can use to check the block chain for What's in your account? Otherwise I don't know. 
I only use coinjar to buy using AUD then send to other wallets so I've never tried to check what you are looking for.

I used CoinJar and after around 30 minutes I had enough confirmations for it to show up in my account. Look up the transaction ID or the address the coins are being sent to and do a search on blockchain.info. It will tell you how many confirmations you have.
Did you buy by depositing cash at a bank? At this time on a Friday night it might take until Monday before the bank processes the payment properly.

You cannot manually validate your purchase. The bitcoin network needs to confirm it for you.
This is done automatically thanks to the way bitcoin processes blocks and transactions. If you look up your transaction ID on blockchain.info you can view where each computer that is processing your transaction is on a world map, pretty cool thing to look at.
