Bitcoin has “failed” about half a dozen times over the past several years.

No more than saying bear markets only last for 24hours

Ahhh... memories
Edit:  For those new around here, this is 100% serious. And they weren’t shitty memes either - they were very, very real.

Exactly.  My goal is 100% debt free as soon as possible, and that absolutely includes paying off my house as fast as I can.  If I could cash out my portfolio right now and pay off everything, I absolutely would.  I can always start re-investing again with the money that I'm saving on my monthly mortgage payment.
If everything goes to shit I will at least have somewhere to go and not be forced to take my family onto the streets.  It's also why I like living in a rural area.  I can grow a garden, hunt and fish from the land etc.  I'm not a prepper by any means, but I like the idea that if everything goes wrong, I can still feed my family and keep a roof over their heads - and no bank can come and take it from me.

The goal is to have no ends to make meet.  I need food, water and shelter.  Pay off the house and you have shelter, grow food and harvest water for the other two.  No electricity?  Fine - people lived without it for all of history.  I’ve got enough clothes to last me the rest of my life (I won’t look good, but I’ll be covered).  What else do I need to survive?  
Yeah, that’s an extreme example, but if the world has really gone to complete shit, the goal is surviving, not paying for DirecTV.

Exactly - this is real money, and people can lose a LOT of it if they aren’t careful. And absolutely nobody knows where this is going.

This is called stability.  And it is very good.  50% rises every couple days lead to bubbles popping...

They shut it down. It’s showing as $0 right now. Fuck Coinbase, and fuck Ajit Pai.

Except for, you know, that 3 year bear market we just came out of...

I bought at $900, then shit bricks when it his $600 and Iost money....if I’d held....
Then again, this might go to 0 and you’ll lose everything. Nobody knows.
