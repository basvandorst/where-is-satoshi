Its so funny that it took 5 years until people realised oh shit this is too slow and the fees are too high for anybody to actually use it day to day. STORE OF VALUE that's what it is.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:11:35
You could compare the SHA
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:31:49
That's what I'm saying. At the best it took 10 mins which is took long to be used anywhere really. People had dreams of using it at the store while shopping.

What happened?

Android Apps aren't binary, it's just APKs (Archives) of Java
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:10:43
I'm going to need that to be open source. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:26:29
Interesting, I never knew a simple solution wasn't available.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:45:06
Keep holding to your coins. Honestly it will jump back up. You put in alot at the peak so you probably aren't into the tech. Just wait until it pops back up and decide to sell at 16k or can you hold on to it for a few months.

I tried to teach my friend how to buy it. They didn't even want to give the site their email. I finally just signed them up and gave her $10 in coin. Now she watches how much it goes up or down every day. Lesson, just do it for them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:05:53
Which may not be the case. The turning point is when I tell them it could drop to 0, I also mention that would take a good amount of time and it do it in an instant, but once there hear that they good big eyed and don't try it.

Let's say I make a $1 bet to you that by saturday bitcoin will go up. If bitcoin is up on saturday you owe me a dollar. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:20:14
Wait, that is a huge over look. If you can't spend it quickly it's worth is lost. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:46
Brain storm possible ideas.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:23:37
I have been into bitcoin for 5 years, I have no idea what a sat/byte is. I also just found out only 7 transactions happen per second. Last this is a scheme, because the network can't handle the traffic and are struggling. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:40:00
They have a huge cash reserve though. You don't think a company with so much prying from by the IRS, wouldn't plan on that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:01:52
Can't you claim coins from wallets that have been inactive for years?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:01:15
How long are the keys?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:20:53
How long does it take for the whole thing?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:12
Then buy more as you use it. And if more companies start accepting there will be no need to turn it into dollars or euros. People who are invested into bitcoin, bought it a long time ago and will hold onto it until it reaches $100k. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:01:42
Some people said that about bitcoin in the beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:18:44
You don't have to pay $20, it will eventually process. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:16:17
I'm just saying lets say you want to buy TV. Find somewhere online that accepts bitcoin, buy that amount in bitcoin, and use that to pay for your TV. The more that credible companies use it the more stable it will become.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:06:29
Yeah it was only 10 cent, by the time I sent it she got more than I sent.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:15:31
I kept telling people actually try to use your btc. They insisted on holding was the better option. I told them just try sending it, they refused. How do you want this to be a everyday currency before you even test the network on a huge scale. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:58:34
"The Americans"  is something wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:22:39
Move your BTC to XRP while it is $1.10, from an investment point the high entry price of the other currencies is turning people away. They all feel they missing the come up. The lower price will make people use XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:04:10
The method isn't developed yet. That's why I need other software and networking people to help come up with the solution.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:59:46
That is what people actually do. I don't think it's impossible
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:06:46
tomorrow if I'm reading this correct.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:54:07
You can't switch if you can't sell, now they just lost a lot of people due to fear. Yet, it did cause the community to realize they need to upgrade their code.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:23:55
Is that 14 day limit designed in the software?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:34:03
They charged me like 10 cents. The people saying Trans fees are high are the impatient people who pay more hoping that it's sent faster. That seems to through off an algorithm and it's being sent slower.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:32:21
I'm sure that would be worth quite a pretty penny. Good thing you have the internet where you can research on the tech that would go into that mission.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:26
No, we would contact people who lost their wallet and work with them to get it back. Then charge a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:09:07
Don't buy it use it. People think it's some type of stock. If everybody just keeps it, it's not serving a purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:01:28
No, I think they just trust that I would give them good advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:17:41
Quick Question: If you send your bitcoin with a low fee and it never gets processed. Can you cancel it?
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:58:17
I just realized it was litecoin, so there fees are lower.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:29:28
hold onto guns and take what you want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:39
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:27:13
Well that's how you identify the people, the next step is to contact. I do admit this project becomes better with comments and reactions. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:38:10
Have you ever Knowingly gave money to an foreign adversary?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:08:25
The trend is very noticable not following that. I think the btc spammers were bch people who realized bch was dropping too and decided to quit. Now the network is just working it's way down. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:01:04
I do have a background in software engineering. It's not a plan to get rich, it's more of an effort to push those lost coins back into the market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:58:30
But if you put effort into finding it and reclaiming the cash maybe a portion of it can be taken as profit and the rest sent to the original holder.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:09:33
What happens when you no longer have access to the wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:35
That's the whole point they are out there somewhere. Lets group together and find a way to claim them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:29:59
Was I right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:46:41
We had mainstream attention, then "someone" spammed us and re understood we aren't ready for mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:22:42
He may pull if he didn't realize you can't use it as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:23:57
Look up the fee that would occur.
