feedback question. Did you undestand that after signing up with your mail you can spread some btc locations on the map? trying to make it clearer

Thanks man! :)
Well as you said is a great way to get first.time users into the bitcoin community. We recomend places were you could use them, so in the long run it can potentially be great for advertising, faucets right now cant give a lot of prizes to people because their profit structure comes from generic advertising. We're thinking more in a near future were lots of shops will like to bring clients trough their door steps.

Hey, thank you for the detailed look. Ok, so
- The reason we added a map in the signup form is for everyone to contribute by suggesting future locations for were we'll put the bitcoins. We may choose cool tourist places but people always are going to have more information on what would be nice places to hide/visit. Right now, you can suggest places by clicking in the map once you've signed up.
-Mail sign up right now is for notifications on the launch :) Besides, reddit is a great way to get people interested in trying out beta versions.
-Thanks for the tip, we'll try again with different resolutions to see how it looks!
