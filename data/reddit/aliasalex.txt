*throws head back in laughter *  people speculate on bitcoin and dont invest in the technology. And furthermore, by buying bitcoin you couldnt even invest in the tech, you only put money in the hands of the exchange

Dude if you look at the earnings reports you can see they are operating at a profit. I dont care why or how, they just do.

I dont know where you get your info but thats simply not true. Facebook is NOT operating at a loss, twitter is yes, but the stocks performace isnt very good if you look at the chart. Over the last five years a lot of companies saw great growth in stock valuation, twitter declined by almost 20%.

The thing is that behind the emotions of stocks stands real economic data. If the companys performance is bad, emotions go bad and the stock price drops. What real economic data backs up crypto? Its just speculation.

Only the new companies DONT get traded based on economic data. If you pay close attention to stock prices after earnings reports you can see that there is a correlation. Tesla is just a blown up dream of Elon Musk. Its overpriced imo. Tesla is living off its hype, so is crypto.
Of course the markets emotions can be exponentially better or worse than the economic situation asks for, but it certainly goes hand in hand. Market cycles are a thing but crypto is not linked to any cycle thats why I find it hard to believe that there is any pattern behind it. You just cant tell whats gonna happen. Its too young and too small for that. And, lets face it, krypto has no use. Just because I can buy clothes in a store in ukraine or pizza in this one pizza place doesnt mean bitcoin is actually worth something. I had fun making money off it last year, but imo the party is over.

You actually believe that horseshit? Bitcoin is fuelled by emotions and nothing else. There is no cycle for that
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:07:14
Yea if you believe anything anyone says about krypto then you deserve to loose your money

No shit Sherlock 
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:54:58
What are you trying to say? I dont get it
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:04:57
Who says I'm investing?
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:38:21
Are there still people who buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:52:33
Don't feel bad. I am happy that I got to witness such a market phenomenon as bitcoin. It was so unpredictable that one shouldn't feel bad about any missed opportunity. I could have played with more risk and could have seen much better returns, but for me as a college student with limited capital it just wasn't worth it
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:37:21
Every clear thinking human being should have known that Bitcoin was a hoax
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:35:20
nah I didnt, I havent touched Bitcoin and Krypto for a long time now
