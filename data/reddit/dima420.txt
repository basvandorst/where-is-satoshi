Have you contacted your bank?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:55:28
Coinbase controls your private keys, so technically they control your coins.

Nice touch on the eggos. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:26:42
Where do you get off saying everyone when you’re talking about yourself. Don’t pretend like you know what you’re taking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:56:39
Maybe follow your own advice?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:52:41
Way better than the 20 posts about people who bought at $17k and sold at $14k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:31:05
I phrased it poorly I guess. You would’ve gained that if you didn’t pay any fees but they ate up the difference and then some. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:04:06
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:46:21
You got some reading to do. This isn’t something you’re gona figure out from one reddit post. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:44:17
How do you invest a lot of money and not know what the fuck you’re talking about. I smell bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:44:35
She’s gona leave you if you keep it up.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:38:57
Did you write that title in yoda speak? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:39
It is owned by Coinbase and you use the same log in. It is just an exchange. Watch some videos on how to limit trade and all that and you’ll get it. It’s pretty straight forward stuff. Main benefit is limit buys have no fees, and you can transfer to Coinbase and back to GDAX with no fees either. 
Edit: meant to respond to you last comment there instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:30:40
Ok, you’re obviously not very bright so I think we’ll end it here. You’re literally making shit up to fit your narrative. At no point was it said he has no bitcoin, just that sending it to himself to make it seem like it was donated is just pointless and dumb. Like you and this post. Good luck with your sad life.

@_date: 2017-12-08 11:46:25
You’re fucking dumb. Take your own advice at the very least though and go away. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:44:49
I bought from amazon and had no problems. When you get it just make sure it prompts you to create a pin and gives you a seed. There are shitty known scams where they try to make you enter a pre set pin but those are just lotech attempts and you can just enter a wrong pin 3 times to reset. No one has actually hacked a ledger as far as anyone knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:23:43
That’s a stupid conspiracy theory. What is his end game? Become a face for bitcoin to donate money to yourself for what? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:09:50
Bitcoin never leaves the blockchain. All the seed word does is translate into a private key which tells the blockchain that you are the owner of these btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:24:30
Honestly that was a pretty dumb move, you kind of brought on yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:20:54
My crystal ball said it’s gona drop a bit though. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:54:21
15% in US after a year. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:56:01
More power to you I guess but I’m not looking to pay taxes on every sell and risk the chance of loosing out on coins with the ups and downs. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:54:02
Once you get funds in your usd wallet you can transfer it to GDAX and then buy btc from there for no fees with a limit order. Otherwise you do not need to deposit usd to Coinbase and can just purchase direct with either your bank account or a CC for instant purchase. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:01:48
Because people appreciate the information that he has provided for them, and it has made people a lot of money. Why are you so fucking butthurt that someone is doing well? Probably just jealousy I’m assuming but damn dude, get a life. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:07:29
That’s just reddit man. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:28:35
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:24:29
You pay the same percentage so it ends up being the same if you trade $100 10 times or $1000 once. But yes, you absolutely have to pay taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:45:26
100% agree. Obviously this wasn’t directed at you then. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:46:44
There a lot of people who have done that unfortunately. Spreading his bullshit is only hindering things. I don’t see why he has to be bitcoin, do your fucking bcash thing and be happy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:47:56
Yes, if you’re looking to day trade then keep a smaller amount that you wana play with in a wallet with quicker access on your phone. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:31:24
It’s barely even out of its beta and it’s already obsolete? Man things sure move quick, good thing you have all the answers.

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:29:23
Good luck with that 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:13:00
Localbitcoins is probably what you want it seems just do some reading and don’t get scammed.

I’m looking forward to more ideas for later milestones if you make em.

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:02:57
There have been thousands of people like you saying the same thing for years. Those that believe in bitcoin will continue to do so. Nothing that is revolutionary has ever happened without a horde of people like you saying it’s going to fail. Sure, something drastic may happen and bring it crashing down, but it will not be because the price is going up too fast, that just makes you sound jealous of missing out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:40:41
Do you have the private keys or access to a wallet they are in? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:50:48
Coinbase owns gdax.  If you do a limit trade on gdax then you will pay no fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:45:03
Should’ve kept some, bad move. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:40:15
At the bottom it’ll tell you what the average is and you can judge based on that and how long you’re willing to wait. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:22:52
Bitcoin being bitcoin.  Nothing new. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:39:26
The fees and swings will eat up your coins in no time. There is no way to predict this volatile market right now and anyone who says otherwise is talkin out their ass. You’ll end selling at what you think is the high and then it just won’t drop. Or you’ll buy in at a dip and it’ll keep dropping. There is just too much chaos to day trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:26:52
You should blindly listen to people on the internet without doing any research. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:28:03
That’s because they send small transactions to verify the amount. Once you verify it they refund it and you’re good to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:03:38
If you’re trying to invest money, and can’t do simple math, then you’re more than a “newbie”. You’re just a person who fucked up at some point in life and crypto should be the least of your concerns. I understand you’re trying to be nice and all but some people just really need to get their priorities straight and not have their hand held their entire lives. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:34:05
Good, hopefully that means it translates to GDAX as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:17:40
Lol, yes. The government gives no fucks about your $.25. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:01:05

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:21
Calm down, click the sell button and go do something else if this worries you that much. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:32
That was a dumb move and you should feel bad about yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:54:42
You know 10 people hold as much money as half of the world right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:01:16
You’ll become numb to it eventually. But really though, diversifying is always good in crypto. You don’t know when the next 300% spike is gona be, just like litecoin in the past 24 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:02:10
A lot of people always say that. They don’t have any idea what they’re taking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:31:53
It’s your money, do what you want with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:52:29

You can pay in cash. Get better pricing possibly and buy before you’re 18. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:22:43
Well you only “gained” .0004 btc, and paid more than that in fees. This is why day trading with minuscule amounts is pointless. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:19:59
Why don’t you go back to school. Not only can you not do basic math but you can’t even put a sentence together to tell someone to shut up properly.

I mean you sure as hell seem like you have it figured out. What’s your goal here? Talk some shit to feel better about yourself? Find a new hobby bud. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:27:11
I know, I’m just hoping maybe a couple people understand that this is normal as well and quit panicking every time the price doesn’t just go up and up constantly. These ups and downs are heathy, constant upward trend should be more worrying than a small dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:48:25
No, I just like to throw money at things without doing research. “Just because”

Haven’t you heard, Elon Musk created bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:58:01
Those coins haven’t moved in forever and I don’t think they’re going to any time soon. I don’t see why Satoshi would sabotage the whole thing, makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:25
Isn’t IOTA centralized though? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:19:14
It’s not arrogant to point out to someone who is investing money that they should be able to do basic math. People are trying to save him money because if he can’t even do that he’s going to fuck something else up down the road. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:47:11
I think you got the wrong sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:19:23

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:34:21
Awwww, is someone cranky they didn’t make more money?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:10:44
Not to anyone’s knowledge. Just make sure it prompts you to create your own pin and gives you your seed and you should be good to go. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:20:27
The first starter internet companies were not globally established like bitcoin is now. Yes it is still in it’s infancy but it seems to have a real foothold in the market now that will be hard to overcome. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:50
Really stupid one at that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:19:55
Anything that can access the internet is at risk of being compromised.  That being said if you control the keys of the wallet you use and basically never turn the thing on, you’re probably fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:34
Cool story bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:34:33
Read the white paper, do some research and decide for yourself. People have confidence in it for a reason. But ya, it could definitely just crash any day so you would be dumb to assume there is no risk involved. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:29:06
And none of them make sense in any realistic way. So again, this is a completely stupid theory “boi”. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:34:06
Ya came to say the same. An exchange is much more on top of things. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:08:13
They had successful trial runs last I saw but no one really knows, hence the “”. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:08:10
Day trading with small amounts is a terrible idea. Maybe if you have dozens of coins to mess around with it’s doable, otherwise it’s just a trap. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:45:24
No, and this will get taken down shortly. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:36:34
Ya he really does seem to be a man of the people and puts himself last in front of others. It is weird to come across someone like that these days.

@_date: 2017-12-03 14:11:33
If you had $5k sitting in your laptop in someone else’s car and not have a seed somewhere else or a backup then you fucked yourself plain and simple.

@_date: 2017-12-12 01:47:42
Not without investing tens of thousands of dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:02:46
If you’re buying a significant amount I would not keep them in their wallet. Get a hardware wallet or even just a paper one and then you’ll control your own private keys. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:42:44
The fact that you’re surprised is also ridiculous. At the very least use GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:30:46
Or maybe if you weren’t lazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:12
I use Coinbase and gdax for myself so I can’t speak to cashing out of blockchain.  If you can hook up with your bank account from there then you can do it that way. Otherwise you can create a Coinbase account and link that with your bank (which will take a week or so most likely) and transfer to that wallet and cash out from there.

So this was you saying something nice then? Lead by example if you’re so high and mighty. I for one would prefer people who can’t do simple math to not come here myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:53
No one really knew it would take off back then. Either way you would’ve sold at some other point before now most likely. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:28:10
This place has become a hive mind where anything not Bitcoin is a shitcoin. Which is just a joke.

@_date: 2019-10-25 19:12:52
For the majority of people it is, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:58:55
Ya pretty much, but by that time btc will go up enough to cancel that out most of the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:41:36

Oh gee thank you so much for your “informative” comment. Go back to r/btc where you belong you moron. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:15:47
They’re not trying to force the issue unlike some. The current state of things can hold out while they perfect it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:12:13
If bitcoin keeps doing what it’s doing, each coin will be worth much more. So it should just work itself out. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:56:35
Go take a nap. Everything will be fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:54:20
I grew up in a poor area. And all I ever heard from family members was how shitty the government is. I moved away at 9 years old so my experience is limited but it left a bad taste in my mouth for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:37:13
I never said I was upset. I’m just responding to an ignorant post. I’m very happy with how things have played out so far. Doesn’t make some people involved any less of a piece of shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:10:05
Just use the faucets that go with it and you’ll get those few fractions faster than the mining option. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:47:34
Get Coinbase cause it’s easy but then transfer immediately to a paper wallet, seeing as how you probably don’t have a hardware one yet. Be ware that bank transfers can take over a week on Coinbase but CC is instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:47:51
Did you just photoshop a post with like 3k upvotes and hope no one would notice. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:51:27
I think they’re going to go through with it only because they are too stubborn and stupid to admit when they’ve lost. I don’t think they’ll drop to 0 in less than 2 weeks either way though. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:22:55
I’m sure people will look back to this year as when it started to really boom. But I think next year will blow this one away. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:03:07
Definitely. Sell your btc now. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:46:23
I wouldn’t worry too much about the extra coins. There are plenty pieces for everyone now. Advances in technology need to be made to make it more main stream, but the amount of coins themselves should be the least of your concerns. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:08:03
Seems a little extreme. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:29:28
Why would people pay you extra to buy from you when, like you said, they have international exchanges. Seems like you’re trying to make a buck off the less informed. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:31:27
Ya you probably just got scammed if what you say is true. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:16:49
Just because the word bitcoin is used doesn’t make it relevant. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:34:57
They’re free, so just get one now.

I’m pretty sure you’re trolling. If in the off chance you’re not, then please just sell and shut the fuck up. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:02:10
Well you are on the subreddit that completely opposes s2x so it’s no wonder that you don’t find arguments in favor of it. The main reason almost everyone is against it is because a small group of people are trying to control bitcoin, something that was meant to be decentralized and not under control of any one small group of people. It is plain and simple an attack on bitcoin to try and privatize and monetize it before the world really knows what it is. Any arguments you read here or anywhere in favor of it are simply going to be from people who want to make a quick buck or are misinformed. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:24:42
How about you learn how to do some research and learn shit on your own instead of asking stupid ass questions you child. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:08
Wtf? How did you amass “great wealth” and not know what an exchange is? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:55:02
People who have it set to sell at 10k on an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:01:58
That was my understanding too. Unless he’s talking about alt coins but that doesn’t make sense as far as what he’s asking. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:40:38
You’re friends with Ryan gosling? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:22:06
Because you don’t have an idea how these transactions work. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:59:52
Anything’s possible I guess and although unlikely,  but with so little activity in the futures market maybe some of the original supporters still trying to pump it up and get some traction. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:17:01
Speak for yourself. With money like that there are better things to be doing than fucking other people over. Those people are the definition of assholes, no matter how you want to sugar coat or explain it. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:07:29
I second this. Was born there, definitely not going back. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:35:45
No one cares 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:57:04
Check r/bitcoinmining. But better yet, just don’t bother even trying to mine at this point unless you have some very deep pockets. At that point just buy btc though. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:03:44
How dare you question Satoshi’s math. But honestly though, why? Miners will get by with fees alone when all the coins are mined anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:00:52
Well good for them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:34
Probably at least like 2 or 3. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:21:33
It doesn’t, I’m sorry for leading you on. I assume OP was also joking. 
As far as the high school thing, I can’t say for sure. I remember like 5 people from then. First graduating class of Lakes. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:16:40
Well you coming here just to talk shit doesn’t make anyone want to have a discussion with you. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:50:42
If you’ve seen so many posts you should already know the answer to your question. Asking people here if you should buy bitcoin is pointless. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:09:40
I see you’ve added some links to your usual copy/paste comments. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:23:11
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:33:57
Bitcoins are forever on the chain. You just need the private key to get them. Which the nano safely holds for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:30:50
Probably not, no. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:33:35
Maybe. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:38
No thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:58:55
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:55:44
Ya, don’t bet them on anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:18:30
I buy through gdax and transfer to my ledger for storage. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:38:02
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:08:05
Forks happened before and will happen again. The market decides value of the split coin, which is usually very little compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:49:31
Spare funds only, don’t loan money to gamble. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:09:27
If you think this is just about fees then you’re just ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:03:57
Just check out blockchain.info and check out some stats and charts. You’ll get plenty of new info. 
Edit: it’s like 16,700,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:55:42
A whole team he says!
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:47:33
I think if he put his mind to it, he could really pull it off though. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:10:50
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:11:26
Maybe to the deep pocketed assholes trying to play around. To others it’s just unnecessary headaches. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:10:35
Good choice too. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:45:44
Cool story bro, but if you think someone with a few millions dollars can throw bitcoin in a loop like that then you do need to take the tin foil hat off. People are buying it still because it’s worth it not because they got played. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:04:01
Damn dude, you’re pretty pathetic.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:48:37
I mean if you’re planning on investing more over time on a regular basis I would still get one. It’s still the most secure way. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:36:45
Can someone smarter than myself explain this as far as adoption goes? Is this somewhat like the lightning network project, and is it really viable? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:24:39
Damn dude, you’re not too bright are you? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:18:56
Yes, that’s probably your best bet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:57:34
Definitely, sell your bitcoin now, this is the last straw. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:27:29
Good counter argument “redditor for 1 week”. Please share more of your bitcoin wisdom with us. Fucking idiot.

Your $1k gets you absolutely nowhere as far as mining goes. Just give that approach up. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:49:52
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:25:07
Probably not though. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:49:13
If you don’t know what the other side is trying to do at this point then you need to do some reading. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:05:43
Anything that comes out of this woman’s mouth is usually complete bullshit. But I would be very surprised if our government wasn’t monitoring a huge booming market. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:58:09
I fucking wish. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:30:30
Might be a good start, anything by Andreas is good though.

Go home, you’re drunk. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:29:18
No offense but you’re honestly better of just googling this stuff. There are infinite answers to these questions now that explain it far better than I can.  As far as price, no one can say for sure and don’t listen to anyone who says otherwise. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:31:52
Wtf? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:15:57
Sounds more like begging to me.

I just tipped you some. You’re welcome.

Why would anyone ever want to do this. Why are you trying to work Paypal into the mix?

What grade are you in now? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:18:47
Most of these are not viable ways of earning bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:35:16
That is way too much shit to explain in a post. Just search the sub or google, plenty of info out there. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:31:25
You’re allowed to say fuck on the internet. It’s ok. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:08:11
I can never blame anyone who got in early for cashing out. People scream hodl but honestly if I could buy a house with bitcoin right now I’d cash out. Still don’t know if I could do all though, def would’ve kept a few just in case. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:45:10
No bro, you should stop talking 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:00:13
The original white paper that satoshi wrote. Look it up, should def read it if you’re here. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:15:50

That’s like a couple of days worth of pay? What are you accomplishing with this post?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:03:47
I mean username does check out, even if only 2 days old. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:54:43
I️ think it would create more confusion seeing as how most people don’t know shit about bitcoin to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:07
Those days are long gone 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:12:27
In theory, yes. Not so much in practice. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:19:56
He definitely is not joking if his post history is anything to go by. What a sad excuse of a person you are. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:30:31
That man alone is a wealth of knowledge on all things bitcoin. So anything by him will be useful. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:55:50
Your title didn’t help. Didn’t really come off as you joking. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:41:34
You only pay taxes if you sell for a gain. Just don’t sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:35:44
Why are you not a millionaire yet with all that “experience”?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:36:42
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:29:41
Doubt it. They’d name us something else and keep the money. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:05:40
What’s wrong with that? Especially if they plan on buying more. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:59:04
A wallet is a place your private key is stored. Having an online wallet usually means you don’t control that key, therefore you don’t control your coins. Paper wallets are a good free way to control your key. Hardware wallets such as Trezor or Ledger are much safer all around because you need your pin to even access it and the private key is never shown. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:33:48
I’m pretty sure he was being sarcastic. At least I hope. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:22:29
Also update your iPhone. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:30:17
I️ mean, he’s not doing anything illegal. Immoral, but not necessarily illegal until he actually steals coins. But that account can be closed by then. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:17:40
There isn’t one and anyone who says different is lying. Which I’m assuming the person you responded to is as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:19:38
They’re selling bitcoin in the form of pieces of paper for a pre determined future price. Like the stock market and stuff. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:12:59
You should take off the tin foil hat, I think it’s fucking with your head. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:19:02
It’s literally not. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:58:04
This isn’t a fucking game. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:15:47
No you just don’t know what you’re doing. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:46:11
You don’t have to yell. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:14:23
It does eventually get old, but at the same time people who don’t bother looking into bitcoin itself and judge it by the random memes they see, don’t seem like a very smart bunch anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:56:32
You don’t need to enter a receive amount. Just scan the receive qr code from ledger with your app and choose the amount to send and should be easy as that. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:13:40
Don’t worry too much. This guy has a vendetta of sorts. Yes Coinbase sucks to an extent but sometimes it’s a necessary evil for early adoption. 
Nice job on accepting btc either way! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:47:12
Yes, always sell when it’s crashing and buy again when it goes back up. Solid strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:29:01
Change wallets then 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:49:29
There is 20 articles and posts a day explaining it in great detail. Please search first. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:05:49
Cool story bro. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:42:20
As long as you don’t actually cash out and just keep it on an exchange you can buy and sell btc as long as you want. Once you cash out you gota pay though. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:14:48
Imagine how the other guy feels. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:11:57
I just tipped you some too. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:40:39
Shut the fuck up. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:42:10
So you spent a grand on bitcoin while you can not afford to buy gas and food? These types of things are usually an issue with the bank not clearing payment though. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:04:47
Go away. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:03:05
62 sold, poor suckers. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:40:34
No, that “man” has never been the best thing to happen to anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:42:50
You should read up on some current events in the bitcoin world. Plenty of posts about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:00:36
Just another good ‘ol decade long pump scam. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:46:34
Cool story bro. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:49:13
Make sure you use the chord they sent you as well, sometimes it also just takes forever for it show the update.

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:07:58
Cool story bro. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:03:56
Is that what that is? I️ was wondering wtf happened. 
edit: it’s apparently the letter “i”
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:25:21
Try google first. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:03:14
No, panic and sell everything 
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:02:28
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:39:43
Don’t worry, 30 other people posted it, along with the $6k mark as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:10:21
That’s the kind of attitude that will get people jumping to help you. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:26:04
I was quoting eurotrip mainly, but thank you for the informative response :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:32:14
I don’t think people will ever turn away from the internet. Either way, they are not related at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:30:58
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:12:39
It doesn’t make sense cause that fork hasn’t happened. Not saying anything about trust, just that this reason doesn’t make sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:15:16
You can’t realistically mine it, just buy it. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:39:19
Doesn’t seem like the smartest move. But get yourself a hardware wallet and move off Coinbase soon either way. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:30:43
If you buy through something like Coinbase it’ll just go through as a regular CC purchase. Just don’t keep your coins in there if you’re buying a decent amount. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:16:21
Ya just wait for Ledger to tell you what to do. They’re pretty good about it from what I’ve seen. Or just check r/ledgerwallet 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:32:06
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:05:14
That has yet proven to be a fact. Forks have happened in the past and btc is the highest it’s ever been. I see this as just another, albeit slightly larger, bump in the road to btc being the sole cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:43:00
You’re posting looking for validation. You know it’s risky but if you’re willing to let it ride then good luck. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:29:33
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:50:08
Where you gona keep your coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:32:28
Sounds like he just forced a rebuttal as fast as he could and it came out sounding like a broken record odd. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:17:44
But you are in the small percentage of people who still own some coins. I wish I bought in at all back then, so at least you got some travels and stories out of it. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:35:15
Then you already have a Coinbase wallet. You just technically don’t own the coins on it until you have the private key. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:32:12
I personally wouldn’t feel safe with them anywhere other than a paper or hardware wallet. Does blockchain give you the private keys? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:15:51
Keep the majority on your Trezor or whatever physical wallet you get. Keep a few bucks worth in something like Blockchain or Coinbase for whatever day to day stuff you may use it on. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:33:34
Would you recommend the Ledger then? I was looking at a couple of different ones and that one did come up a bit along with Trezor. Thanks in advance. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:17:50
I just don’t see why you wouldn’t buy a Trezor or Ledger. Just get a paper wallet at that point I guess. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:21:36
Did you just make 2 posts asking opposite questions? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:13:53
Magic. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:09:46
I think they’re aware, check the username. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:09:07
That doesn’t make sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:11:04
Well first of all double check the address. But Coinbase has been super slow all day with people transferring last minute otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:34:22
You’re overreacting 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:24:07
This doesn’t answer any questions for new people. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:03:39
Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:06:24
That’s a very ignorant question. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:27:07
Ya they’re super legit, give them all your money. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:43:42
I bought a Trezor and keep most of it there and only keep a bit on Coinbase if I need to use it for something. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:28:12
Why does $6k matter?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:31:34
After Breads announcement today I would not go with them. Buy a physical wallet and transfer to that. Something like Ledger or Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:21:17
Is it?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:20:33
The internet 
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:47:27
Seems like a much better and easier option. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:57:27
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:38:40
It does Eth and Ltc as well as a couple others I believe, but I only mess with btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:49:56
Once you set up the nano, transferring is as easy as scanning the receive address on your nano from your Coinbase app. You control the private keys once it’s in your nano so you’re good to go from there. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:10:45
Ya I sold everything before it goes even lower. /s
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:48:54
So? What the fuck does it matter. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:40:22
Exactly, I bought one as soon as I went over $100. Didn’t take much convincing to keep my money safe. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:13:06
I hear it gets very depressing in the winter. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:13:03
He never said all of it, just a significant amount. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:25:15
Services are slow but you’re staying on the btc chain, I don’t see what can go wrong other than it taking longer. Correct me if I’m wrong please. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:39:00
Get a Ledger or Trezor and send it there. It’s as easy as scanning the qr code and sending the coins over, and then they’re actually yours. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:23:42
As long as you got your address right I don’t see see what can happen. Just give it some more time. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:35:45
Have you called your bank on this? Heard about a few people having issues with their bank and not Coinbase itself. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:57:18
I got mine off amazon. Not sure if that makes it any better but it should be relatively easy to tell if the unit has been tampered with when you receive it. As long as the seller is well rated I would say it’s fine but I guess you never know for sure  
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:02:47
I see no need for anyone who supposedly has that much time and effort and not just money invested in something to cash it all out at this time. If he/she/they need the money they can cash out some and keep the rest. This idea of a rogue satoshi or any one man army to me seems ridiculous. They created bitcoin, why try to undermine it now?

The fork will happen sooner than people thought. May be an issue for some people who didn’t have time to pull their coins off Coinbase or what not. There’s a million other threads for more in depth info.

Coinbase will just switch your coins over to the new chain if they follow it as they seem to be doing. So I would move them off their if you want to keep your btc.

It says it takes 3-5 business days. You should have it next week. Buying through a bank account gives you a higher limit but takes longer to receive.

At least it gives me something to downvote while I browse new posts.

In theory yes, but I don’t think the world would be in a healthy place for that to happen.

The site will not refund you. It is at your own discretion as far as I’m aware.

I guess huge is a relative term. Less than a year ago $1k would be devastating, now we swing $500 a day and don’t bat an eye. But I agree, I think there is going to be some volatility for sure but after the dust settles btc will come out ahead without dipping below $4k. &lt;— completely random guesses btw.

You’re on a subreddit that loves bitcoin. Of course we’re gona mostly tell you to do it. That being said, do some research, make sure you’re able to withstand the volatility if you decide to invest. And learn how to be in control of your coins if you do.

Personally I stay away from anything without a product. To rise so far as it did on the fact that Dan Larimer is behind it just doesn’t sit right with me. The whole worthless token thing doesn’t bother me but overall I just prefer multi billion dollar projects to have a real working product and not promises. 
Edit: billion, not million $
