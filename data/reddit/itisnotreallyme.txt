[It is in the original]( and every other version as far as I can recall.


I pay taxes because the state will use violence against me if I don't, the exact same reason as for the people in Robin Hood's world.

Are you suggesting that people who do not think it is acceptable to steal other people's property are freeloaders?
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:02:44
So you agree that it is wrong for the state to force people that are not willingly using any state infrastructure or services to pay taxes?
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:23:36
I understand that. My main intent is not really to convince anyone. It is not very common for people to change their mind about an issue as fundamental as the legitimacy of the state so I highly doubt I could change anyones mind about that in a reddit conversation. I mostly debate with people because I'm interested in why they believe the things they believe.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:29:15
I'm certainly not a member of the states 'club' but it seems like we are moving the goalpost a little here so let me ask you this: Is there anything other then the states superior capacity for violence and their willingness to use said violence that should compel me to obey it?

The problem is that rulers exist, not how they are chosen.
But I think blockchain based voting is an exciting idea when applied to consensual organizations.

I don't know very much about objectivism but I have never heard one of them criticise charity, the same can not be said about statists.
I am not saying that can't be an objectivist but he/she can just as well be a conservative, socialist or libertarian.
It is impossible to determine ztsmart's political stands based on that comment, the only think it says is that he/she is an asshole.

Why can't you argue your point instead of trying to insult people?

Glenn Beck is a conservative which is about as far from libertarian as you can come in mainstream american politics and Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist that calls himself a libertarian (but I have never heard him talk extensively about it so it is hard to judge). Both of them are in favor of a state.
I was more specifically talking about voluntaryists (sorry I wasn't clear about that but I still don't think the majority of libertarians regardless of camp have anything against voluntary social safety nets).


Yes but so are everyone else except pacifists, I am a pacifist on a personal level but I do believe people have a right to protect the product of their labor if they want even if I would choose not to.


I am neutral to the following types of violence:
* Consensual violence (Martial arts, BDSM, enforcement of contracts etc.)
* Self-defence (using violence to stop somebody from attacking you or your property*)
* Defense of others (using violence to stop somebody from attacking someone else or their property* if they want your help)
/* Property is here define as something the owner have created or been given by another owner.
I am against all other forms of violence.


(ignoring the fact that a 'campaign donation' is worth far more that a vote)
A group of people can't have a right that none of it's members have. it's just as wrong for you to go to your neighbor's house with a gun, point it at him and demand that he relocate to your basement for the rest of his life because he possessed a plant or chemical that you dislike whether you have the support of a million people or if nobody support you.


No, my ideal is where nobody can vote on what others can and can't do with their life and property.


I don't think so, I think it's coercion that leads people to treat others like shit.


I am sorry but I don't understand what you are trying to say here.


Prisons, military and police are the worst parts of the state, they are the enforcement arm of the state and responsible for more violence and coercion than any other organisations. There is absolutely nothing libertarian about them.

Yes it does, if one person is willing to buy drugs and another person is willing to sell drugs, both of them have gained value regardless of the government's opinion.
I think silk road was one of the best things to come out of bitcoin as it can have saved hundreds of lives because the drugs on SR was much safer than street drugs (even FBI admitted to that).
Why should the state get to decide what value is?

In what way?


And it is my opinion that the government is harmful for society but I don't try to kill or kidnap people who disagree with me.
How many people are hurt by drugs vs governments?

No, the community is saying: "We don't want anything to do with you if you do this"
The government would say "We will steal from, kidnap or kill you if you do this"

The government is absolutely my enemy and I definitely did not elected it.

I was mostly trying to illustrate that he actually didn't cause any damage and that without the state he would not have tried to kill anyone.
The sate on the other hand kills a lot of people regardless of the free market.


I live in Sweden and the police kills on average 1-2 people a year and it seems that most countries kill many more.
There was no way he could have defended himself and his customers in any other way, I would not have tried to kill the attacker but instead warned everyone and flee the country but that would have allowed the government to imprison a lot of innocent people.
I am not trying to say that he did the right thing but that there was no way anyone could have done the right thing.
What is your "ideology" and when do people of the same ideology as you support killing? 


Ok, let me come out and say it: I do absolutely entirely and without reservation oppose the assassination market, I think it is immoral, harmful, ineffective at its stated goal and I believe that nobody deserves to die.
Can you say the same about war?

I´m not an expert but I will attempt to help:
1. There will just mine some more I think, I couldn't find any limit in the protocol but It is so long and complicated that I have a hard time understanding it.
2. I dont know how the transfer mechanism works but I think it can take some time, try an ask at r/Dollar
3. I can´t see why not but it is always important to be careful when dealing with unstable currencies.
4. I wold wait the price is most likely going to go down some more.
5. That is a known security bug that I assume will have a fix soon although development have stood still for a long time now.

1. DPR never actually killed anyone.
2. One of the people he allegedly tried to kill threatened to release information that would give the state means to kidnap (and knowing how police often handel things, kill) thousands of people. 
3. The other person had stolen from him (according to the fbi) and was arrested by the fbi, the hitman was also form the fbi.
It is of course still wrong and immoral to kill someone but the government was with him all the way.
4. There is no proof to any of this and the government is known to lie a lot.
5. Statists believe in controlling other people which of course include violence while ancaps believe the complete opposite.
6. The ancaps (and other types of anarchists) are in power every time you don't use violence,
every time you have sex and it is not rape we are in power,
every time you you buy something instead of stealing it we are in power,
every time you you talk to the person you are angry at instead of hitting him/her in the face we are in power.
Edit: And very few ancaps supports the assassination market but very many statists supports wars, prisons and theft
