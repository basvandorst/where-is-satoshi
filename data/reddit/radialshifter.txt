i would surrender the info right away and give you a dummy wallet
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:27:03
I think that's a bit disingenuous considering 1 BTC was less than 1 USD a few years ago. (not that I agree with the OP message either)

Who says you HAVE to have liquid cash on hand to get BTC? What if I'm desperate and sell everything i own for BTC?

make a gyros

If i didn't have a dummy wallet and gave you everything you would still threaten me again, so why not cut my losses?

half the world CAN buy bitcoins =/= half the world WANTS to buy bitcoins

its not so much volatile as it is guaranteed to lose value thanks to inflation.

Please link and/or credit the original source... and get rid of the tip address, all you did was rip and re-upload in lower quality.

what about P2Pool?

Pretty unlikely, no one has enough computing power to bruteforce 51% of the bitcoin network by themselves.

Anyone who thinks storing something of value in a safety deposit box is nuts is probably hopeless anyway

good luck "forcing" anything on open source encryption FORK FORK FORK FORK
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:39:34
Well of course there will be forks that go nowhere but there will be also forks that go somewhere especially when the main function of the software is not up to snuff.
@_date: 2015-04-12 15:49:04
Is there a reason a more secure fork of publicly compromised software wont catch on?
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:23:51
Good luck with that lol, states already have issues keeping track of tax on online purchases already

how was dinner?
@_date: 2013-10-10 21:44:39
HUUUUUUUUUUURP, reading comprehension fail on my part.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:18:22
soooooooooo I should buy more now or later? :P

A proper backup should ALWAYS be isolated..... especially if they involve large amounts of money or value like a bitcoin wallet.

Since when is it ok for the FBI to use a zero day exploit O-o
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:08:15
Bitcoin was originaly more of an anarchist thing *hipster glasses*
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:17:03
Why does the price matter if its divisible to up to 8 decimal points?
@_date: 2013-10-10 15:16:43
That is horrifying...... note to self don't bank in Italy o-o
