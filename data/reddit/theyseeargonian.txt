Really, eh? I'm too much of a cynic so my mentality is not there yet. Is there any specific info you learned that convinced you bitcoin will replace fiat? Seems like the world governments are only willing to let it grow to a certain point before stamping it out. I don't know as much as I should considering I put money down but, how do you think bitcoin will overcome that barrier? That seems like the only real hurdle, government regulations.

[ Up to 2 BTC withdrawal without ID,]( but now that I think about it, I'm not sure what their policy is on adding US dollars because I'd already had bitcoin that I transferred in. It may be different if you want to transfer money from your bank account, and they use tether on binance, so if I were you, I'd go with bitstamp. They're ranked number 3 right under coinbase as best bitcoin exchange.

The bid is what people without bitcoin are willing to pay for it, and the ask is the price that people with bitcoin are willing to sell them for. If you want to buy bitcoin, you can purchase immediately at whatever the ask price is at, or you can set your own bid price and wait for someone to accept. The constant changing of the prices is like going into a store and trying to bargain. You wanna pay 5 bucks (the bid), but the shopkeep is selling for 10 (the ask). So you tell him you'll pay 7, but he doesn't change his mind. Another person walks in and says they'll pay 8, but he still won't sell the bitcoin. A third person comes in and says they'll pay 9, but again no.  
  This time, another shopkeeper walks in and he's selling bitcoin for 8 bucks, so all those people that were bidding on the first shopkeepers bitcoin now turn to the second shopkeeper and buy from him. Well, now that first shopkeeper is worried he won't be able to see his bitcoin, so he prices his at 7 bucks. He's happy that focus is back on him, but now 10 more people walk in wanting to buy his bitcoin, so he raises the price up back up to 10, maybe even 11 or 12. If a couple people pay that price, then others might follow. That's basically how it works.

  This world is the one you're thinking of. The heroes of bitcoin are those who hedl after it dropped from $1000 to $200, where it would stay for 2 years.  These days, people commit suicide because they didn't hodl as long as those legends back then. In any event, I agree with your statement that holders are idiots. Might I also add that they're quite ugly as well. Hodlers, on the other hand, are the investment world master race.

The company that prints tether(fake US dollars) was robbed of 30 million a few weeks ago and people are losing faith in their claims that they have US dollars to back up every piece of tether that they print. I would try bistamp if you just want the basics (bitcoin, etherium, ripple) or binance if you want access to a lot more alt coins. I'm pretty sure that you don't need to be verified on binance to fund your account as they allow withdrawals up to 2 BTC without ID.

Did you buy bitcoin to make short term gains? If you did, then you're playing a losing game because you have weak hands. My unpopular opinion is that the only value bitcoin has is as a long term investment, like gold. It's an obsolete currency because of how long transactions take, but [it prints money at a stupid high rate if you park your cash]( You hold for more than a year and you're making serious bank, but open up the weekly/daily charts and it's vicious highs and lows. Lots of folks succeed at day trading, but they've got balls/tits of steel and scoff at being 16% in the red (unless it goes against their strategy).
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:13:50

Yes and no. The slow confirmation time and higher fees is why many people use alt coins (ripple, etherium, litecoin etc) to move their wealth around, but segwit+lightning network is supposed to bring bitcoin back on par with all the other, faster coins. So, for right now, yes you're right, but long-term, no.

Then I salute you for hodling through far more tumultuous times. However, hodl is much more than a drunken typo, but a rallying cry for every pair of weak hands that's ever sold just as prices skyrocket, or bought in right before a major drop. That tirade of his was worthy of an inebriated Abe Lincoln. Just look at how quickly those downtrodden users from back then latched onto the jumbled speech; they immediately recognized the importance of his words. I gotta believe that if bitcoin continues to survive through bubble pops and grows long term, then there will be quite a few people getting HODL tattoos.

  No. Buying crypto is like buying stock or any other security. There are hoops you need to jump through to get in the game, and these hoops help protect us all from fraud.

I suggest Quadriga. Low fees and, depending on who you bank with, you may be eligible for instant interac online instead of having to wait days for wire transfers. If you're keen to dive in right away, you can go to coinbase and buy some with your credit card, but you'll be limited to buying $100-200 worth of coin until you're fully verified (and even then, I've heard the limit doesn't go up by very much).  
  My first purchase was through coinbase, but after they limited me to $100 a week, I bought from mybtc with my credit card and transferred to Quadriga, but I don't recommend that because mybtc fees are high. Whatever website you choose, make sure you sign up asap because it can take some time for them to verify your ID (hence why I broke down and bought from mybtc instead of waiting for Quadriga to verify me).
