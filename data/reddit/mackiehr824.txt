Bitcoin has crashed plenty of times already. 20k --&gt; 3.5k is not exactly surprising for those of us who entered this space before 2017.
2011 = -93%
2013 = - 73%
2014 = -84%
People tend to forget about this.

I only have a checkings with BoA and I've been with them for 12 years. If they want to pull this kind of shit on me, I'd have NO problem pulling all my funds out and banking with someone else.
I just like BoA for the convenience factor.

Bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver, whose view for bitcoin is a bit different from what the core team wants. The website pushes his political agenda a bit.
That being said, it does not have a reputation for being fraudulent or a scam. Is simply has a reputation for being biased towards Ver's vision.
I personally wouldn't, but that's just me

Well I'm 100% confident it won't  rebound ... so you should sell everything now.

Right now, I'm using *only* the interest I'm making to pay off my Rent/Bills  every month... that was a short goal of mine that I recently accomplished.
I'm thankful to have an extremely high paying job for my age, with 0 debt. So I'm just continuing to funnel roughly ~25% of my monthly income in numerous stocks.  Currently have about 10k tied up in bitcoin investments at the moment, and am now just starting to diversify.
My long term goal is financial independance.
