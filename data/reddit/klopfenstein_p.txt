There must be some type of requirements, my goal was to create a starting point and go from there. What you are saying is that with minimum performance requirements, more transactions can be processed than a large mining farm can mine.
Security shouldn't be any different than how a company runs a btc node. To lower any risk, we could have multiple gateways; gateway1.business, gateway2.business, gateway3.business and so forth.

Yes, I understand, the company this is for is seeking to reduce environmental impact.
There is no concern with onchain or offchain, if it is secure and goes from a to b, great. What is needed is the tech specs to be able to process the amount I need to put together.
EDIT: If anyone needs it, I found this link which may help you if you are in my position:

This question is for linux if anyone can help; What are the specs for a node or node(s) that processes a high volume of transactions of up to 1M / day?

Miners, more or less, are payment processors.
What you are saying then is that we will achieve better security than what is currently available, where each transaction is secure and we follow a similar security procedure.
I need to know the tech specs of such processing power, everything else looks good.

It is not for me, it is for a company. I need to compile the specs of server requirements for a hub or node that can transact up to 1,000,000 (1M) transactions / day. The node or hub addresses to send encrypted transfers for example would be; gateway.business. I read your post history and it says, "big companies like Amazon, Ebay, Apple, Internet providers, Mobile providers etc.", I don't think they would be running a raspberry pi, these are the specs I am after.
