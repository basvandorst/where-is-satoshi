In your estimation the entire global system will shift to protecting rather than prosecuting cyber criminals and they will become commissars?
Seems like a bit of a stretch...
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:01:28
And this is definitely bad?
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:01:59
Is this bad?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:14:49
Looks like someone is shadow banned?
Also where is the 2.5X coming from....?

was clearly speaking as the vendor, while the replies were considering the customer/end user perspective.

....hopefully? I can't say this makes me sleep any better when using Coinbase....
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:27:40
Care to provide an explanation?
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:23:53
Can you explain what's logical about the second half of your comment?
Is there something logical about being a divisive force here?

So as someone who has only observed from the periphery, have we crunched the numbers to determine if there is enough computing power for anyone, even the US government, to actually rehash the block chain?
Do I have accurate notions of the way in which the block chain consensus is maintained?
My understanding is that without blowing a hole in the basis of cryptography, this is the only way that the block chain could be corrupted.
Furthermore, does anyone have any speculation on if/how the increase in difficulty will affect the value? I imagine this has probably been discussed to death here already....

Everybody responded to you with a bunch of "Dude Bitcoin is taking over duh" answers instead of a direct answer, because you're not wrong.
Most **vendors** *don't* accept raw bitcoin.
Is it so difficult to believe that a lot of vendors can't afford even 5% volatility on some part of their revenue?

Hey, I think your troll account is hilarious :)
Let the greenbackers hate as they continue to inflate!

Aren't these things all archived?
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:10:57
It's the most recent, and most efficient. It's effectively the devil of modern times.

I don't completely understand having such a conclusive attachment to a single iteration of a technological design.
Diversifying the assets in your capital flow isn't a new concept. Keep Bitcoin on your ledger as long as you want. Maybe it will get bumped off by UltimateFutureCoin or maybe it won't.

I suppose you should search, but a bunch of other people here suppose they should give you witty comments to show how cool they are.
Wow this community has gotten so much better /s

I wish I had not read this thread.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:46:32
Why would it go that high?
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:28:03
I'm pretty familiar with it, I just don't think it answers original comment...
2FA is exactly what you use to prevent all of that. Are you going to use secret email addresses?
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:32:22
How does someone bypass 2FA with social engineering?
Do you let anyone peruse freely through your phone?
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:30:08
Where does she bypass 2FA?

In other words, if you're a casual *web browser* you're probably not hiding your activity very well?

The U.S. government and major banks are well aware of what competing currencies can do. They certainly have their eye on it, because it does indeed pose a huge risk, albeit theoretical.


I don't understand, are you trying to divorce politics and economics?
@_date: 2013-09-06 18:10:19
Ah sorry, I misread.
My point of contention was that the security of Bitcoins does seem pragmatically sound, but I am still learning about it.
@_date: 2013-09-06 06:04:53
I doesn't seem like the OP meant merely "petty" resentment, but of course I could be wrong. I would imagine he was implying a general resentment as a result of the domination of the petrodollar, which is rather well established by international polling. I doubt that many states are very pleased after being forced into unfavorable positions by the United States.
It seems that you understand this as the countries you listed are among those which have experienced the worst as a result of the Cold War and U.S. foreign policy.
@_date: 2013-09-06 20:27:06
Due to potential user errors? Or is this an inherent flaw?
@_date: 2013-09-06 00:10:51
Having your assets seized and the key "beaten" out of you.
@_date: 2013-09-05 23:07:01


What is the circumstance for this?
Seems like a fairly impractical and extreme hyperbole.
Unless you're into illegal arms trafficking.

Well, I would contest that it does indeed create value as long as this material/commodity/substance is in demand.


Exactly. Value from utility is more effective, sustainable, and (to be redundant) useful, than value from rarity.
Edit: grammar
