You have no idea the life here especially in provinces .Not everyone has a land to plant crops to sale and to depend on. Imagine the landmass and the population.And the population is bigger than the land mass. Most of the child's of people who are living in provinces or remote control are everyone going to cities to find a job. And most of them has no educational background or even don't know the law itself or the law as an employee in any jobs. And for them and for us we have no choice than to follow the employers We are always being fuck over by employers and working 12 hours or 13 hours aday with switching working shift by morning and you only have 4 hours sleep .Try to search and experience it before say anything but I don't judge you coz that's the way you see but as for me who seen the reality and hardship as an asian. I'll always keep to tell to the world the reality and I work slot and seen the lives in cities or even in provinces and  it’s poor, and it’s very sad. And I’ve always taught myself to look for the beauty in it. To look in the beauty in the faces of the children and to be grateful. And I would bring this aspect as a Human being in this earth to see situations with a silver lining, and to assess, where I could give something, where I could provide something, as a spokesperson and as a human being, and if I could teach also people to be grateful, we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster and children would have a smile on their faces
