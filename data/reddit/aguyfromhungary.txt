Arguably, being exposed to numerous vulnerabilities that are known by every script kiddie (which is what happens if you don't install OS patches) is worse than being exposed to a couple of obscure exploits that only the CIA and a few others know about.

Which is worthless against content that's as little as packaged into an encrypted rar file. So they hardly solved the problem, although they did what they could.

I think it is. Rar uses an algorithm that's known to be secure, and I don't think there's a known way to simply crack it. And I don't think dropbox is the kind of organization that could be sitting on a major flaw in a commonly used encryption format without it getting out. They aren't the NSA.

All I got 15 hours ago is 0.00001 BTC. I can't even get it out of coinbase because it's less than the minimum transaction amount.

If I was a US citizen, I wouldn't even need the $137,000's worth of motivation to get the fuck out of there to Europe. The 137k is only there to help a huge deal with moving.

All you have to do is get a Geiger counter rigged into your computer and generate your random numbers using the decay events of radioactive nuclei. If you do this, the randomness of the numbers will be guaranteed by the laws of physics. It's the equivalent of asking god himself(if he existed) to give you random numbers.

You could permanently move into a tax heaven, acquire local citizenship, renounce the US citizenship and THEN cash out.

Oh, yeah, it's obvious now. I really should go to sleep.

So what happens when you decline to make a private contract with the military, and a foreign nation decides to take over your area? The military will just be like: "Right this way gentleman." And leads the attackers directly to your door, and away from their customers, or what?

So, out of curiousness, what is your opinion on movie, music and book copyrights? What do you think about the file-sharing of said materials? What do you think about ad-blocking on the internet?

Why did you only include federal governments? Not all influential countries in international trade are federal.

As long as you only buy booze and cookies in the grocery store with cash, they wont catch you. But if you are seen in public wearing expensive clothes and driving expensive cars, spending hundreds of dollars in expensive restaurants, while having a minimum-wage job, eventually someone who doesn't like you, or a jealous co-worker or someone like that will tip off the IRS to check you out.

How exactly do you imagine for example financing the military or the police? Or do you think such things are absolutely unneeded?

If he moves the coins through Tor(to hide his IP), a police report will do fuck all.

Did I miss something, or everybody on r/Bitcoin is tripping on mushrooms? Why exactly are we trying to solve problems that doesn't exist yet?

One of the points of bitcoin is that it's harder to tax, so tax time is gonna suck for the government.

If I was certain the end of economy is near, I would definitely stockpile cigarettes. I don't smoke(anymore), but they would make nice barter products. And they are divisible to the individual cigarette.

The rich may not pay taxes, but the middle class does. And the rich need the middle class to pay taxes, otherwise the whole system that keeps them rich would collapse very soon. But bitcoin makes the middle class able to do what the rich do: keeping money and trading overseas, out of the hands of the govt.

Or if that absolutely doesn't fit, then comes the "think of the children".
