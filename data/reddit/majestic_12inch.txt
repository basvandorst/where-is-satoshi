OK but that's not what you said, was it? You could just say "I'm wrong" rather than try and move the goalposts with a 100 word reply. With a link to a hypothetical bubble graph that I've seen hundreds of times before.
As for killing the hype, well we'll see how things look a year from now... 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:25:01
Not afraid of words, I just find it frustrating when people make false statements and then try and change their argument.


Well it was at the time, so your initial claim was false. 
I think a mistake you're making with your opinion on this being the "big one that kills the hype", is that you're considering the price per coin as too high (~$10,000), when this is simply an arbitrary number related to the total number of coins. If you were around when Bitcoin hit $1000 dollars, people were saying exactly the same thing.
And a $200bn market cap isn't that big in the grand scheme of things. Like I said, we'll see in a year or two what happens - we could see a couple of years of stagnation like after the Gox crash, but speculative bubbles aren't gonna make Bitcoin go away.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:58:27
What are you on about man, is English your first language?


With all due respect, this statement is simply not true. $31 was a high point, and it crashed. $1000 dollars was a high point, and it crashed. Many other times were high points, and it crashed. 
Therefore this is *not* the first time Bitcoin has crashed from its high point. It's pretty simple dude.

I imagine magic internet money may just be interesting to some kids? I know when I was 10 I was into sci-fi, gaming and computers; our family got a 486 around that time with a 66 MHz processor, and I couldn't believe my dad upgraded from 4 MB of RAM to 8 for like $500 or something like that. It came with a 28.8k modem and I found the concept of the Internet incredible.

Errr no, there have been multiple major crashes, with many far higher in % than this one, for example the ~90% drop in 2011, and two or three more with a 70%+ drop. We're only at about -50% right now. 
Not sure why you couldn't do some basic research before posting...
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:44:46
I think I get it, I guess the problem I'm trying to get my head around is if one party (lets say the shorter) already has the ability to cause a crash because they already own BTC, that they have been buying in this rally. And the other party (going long), has no BTC hedge.
In this scenario, wouldn't the shorter have the ability to manipulate the market in his favour, by market selling the BTC on an exchange and then closing his short position in cash when the BTC price falls as a result of his market sell? Possibly even a cascade effect of multiple shorters doing the same thing (using software bots/algorithms, or by collusion)?
And if it's a margin short, wouldn't this give an advantage to the short seller (assuming they had stocked up on BTC beforehand, to sell and drop the BTC price)?
But the risk is certainly there - there might not be enough people shorting/manipulating to make the price drop far enough, essentially liquidating all the short positions and sending the BTC price even higher, right?

If you've been to any low-wage economy countries, you'd know this isn't the case. McDonalds costs pretty much the same as it does in the West ($5 for a Big Mac meal roughly), but you can get a traditional meal for less than $1, which will fill you up just as much.
McDonalds might not be as popular as in the USA, but they're still making a shitload of money. They also can pay their employees a lot less.
Not to mention most people that are well off won't be going to McDonalds anyway, they'll go to a classy expensive burger joint instead.
I think your scenario is a lot more complicated than you make it out to be.

Not sure I understand your point - mining can't exceed the amount wasted because there wouldn't be enough power coming from the source to power the miners in that location. 
If the power plant needs to increase power output then they would charge more for the power, resulting in the possibility of the miners moving somewhere else with cheaper power (likely coming from oversupply or renewables).
The point he's trying to make is that:
A. Miners go to where power is cheap.
B. These are places where there is excess power, whether from fossil fuels or renewables (and renewables are becoming cheaper all the time, and can't be turned off - you can't save sun or wind power (without investing in batteries or hydroelectric mechanisms), like you can save coal to be burnt another day, which is obviously cheaper than batteries or other forms of saving renewable power).
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:52
You seem to know what you're talking about, and I agree with you that the "scalping" thing is unlikely.
As someone who is knowledgeable about markets, can you help explain why the following scenario is likely/unlikely/plausible?
1. Traders buy huge amounts of BTC before the CME futures open, pushing the price up (maybe happening now?).
2. Traders short BTC in cash when the CME futures open.
3. The same traders market sell their newly accumulated BTC, causing a crash in BTC price (and gaining huge amounts of cash due to their short positions).
4. Traders close their short positions, reaping the cash profits (along with the profit they may have made on their initial BTC purchases)
5. [optional] Traders rebuy BTC at low rates and attempt to capitalize on "buying the dip".
If this is possible, then I think we could be in for a wild ride. But I honestly don't know enough about how these "futures" work to know if it would be profitable, for example I've no idea on how much margin (if any) will be available if you want to short BTC through these CME futures...

Thanks for providing a source. However there's a fatal flaw in the data - it doesn't account for wasted energy being used for mining, or how much mining is powered by renewable energy (so the carbon footprint estimate is basically nonsense).
As he says in the video, bitcoin mining power does not scale in terms of number of transactions. And it also congregates around areas with cheaper power, which are mostly areas where power is wasted, whether it's from fossil fuels or renewables.
And renewable power is becoming cheaper all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:50:20
You're basically agreeing with him without realizing it, I think. By saying mining is "geographically-independent" he means that mining farms can move anywhere on the globe with an internet connection.
As a result, they can (and will) move to the areas of the planet where electricity is the cheapest, often due to excess supply. And often due to green energy, because there's no need to "turn it off".
I'd love to see the maths on your second hypothesis - how much power does the global banking system actually use? I'm not challenging you to tell me, it would be an incredibly difficult number to calculate. But consider that global banks are not "geographically-independent" - they need to set up shop in the areas where they are most needed, not in the areas with the cheapest power.

Thanks for the great response, yeah I understand what you mean about the risk - 35% is pretty hefty margin in such a volatile market (even though forex margins can be far higher, but obviously with far less volatility).
I guess I'm just worried that there might be enough collusion between traders to manipulate the market in their favour. Is this illegal? I know it is with normal forex markets for example, but what about with Bitcoin?
And as for number 4, wouldn't closing the short in a cash market have no direct effect on the Bitcoin market? i.e. the traders are securing cash profits on a short sell on a future index, without directly affecting the BTC market?

Anyone thinking that the references in the whitepaper might be part of the puzzle?
There are 8, so [2] [5] ~~[7]~~ might have something to do with it. Also the clue 00212121 has 8 digits. And if you +1 in hex, (01222222) you get speech marks which might relate to the titles of the references. The titles have words which are in the word cloud.

Additionally, the key starts with "L" so must be a compressed WIF key - 52 characters long. This means that each number is a single digit, with 2 identical digits (the vertical line with 2 squiggly lines intersecting at the top and bottom) and the other 5 digits unique.
0=0, so we can discount that. the symbols must be 1-9, with 2 the same...
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:17:13
Good shout on the lower case l. I was wondering why the keys I've been trying were not valid. Most likely it's a mistake and should be capital L (or something else...)

I'm not going to bother addressing all your points, because they're mostly just your opinions. But:


Most major fiat like USD, EUR, GBP is *not* pegged to anything, you're wrong. It's manipulated, sure, but it's not pegged. You're talking about two different things. Other currencies might be pegged to these, but that's different. You can look at fluctuations even in the last year between these three major currencies to disprove your point.


You really have no evidence for this though, and you're assuming that these "big players" are in debt in the first place. With a falling fiat currency, why would people *not* accept payment in another non-national currency/asset? We already see this in countries whose currencies are unstable - they have a huge USD market. Sure, it's cash and not digital but it exists.


How many of these are exchanges/funds?
And sorry, but just quoting you from your earlier post:


You see, this little paragraph proves that you really have no idea. Firstly, what is the point of a regulated state cryptocurrency using a blockchain? If it's *regulated,* then it has to be using a *private blockchain* right? Because otherwise a malicious actor could 51% attack it (or use other attack vectors). So if it's using a private blockchain, what's the point of using a blockchain at all? Just a normal distributed database would work just fine.
You seem to be intelligent, but somehow you don't know the meaning of "Ponzi Scheme"? You're either trolling or just parroting things you've heard other people say.
The whole point of crypto is that it allows transfer of value with no third party, and this includes no regulation/manipulation of the currency by a dedicated third party (like a central bank). Sure, it can be manipulated by individuals; but the idea of introducing a third party to "regulate" the value is totally at odds with the ideology. And besides, by doing such a thing the cryptocurrency simply becomes another normal currency.
You really should do more research before spreading such misinformation.

"Educated in economics"
"Doesn't know what Ponzi Scheme means"
Hmmm. You also didn't really address any of my points. 
I know about everything you're saying, it still doesn't mean all fiat is necessarily pegged. I already said some currencies are pegged to the three I mentioned. Are you just trying to admit you were wrong in a roundabout, confusing way? China is an example of a pegged fiat currency which is intended to stay weak, to strengthen exports - I don't know why you didn't mention this in your reply. But the three I mentioned are not pegged by any definition of the word.
I obviously know about world debt, I was talking about "the big players in crypto" that you mentioned - Are they in debt? Big exchanges and mining farms/pools? 
That IMF article is pretty much a load of waffle, it briefly mentions "central banks issuing digital tokens of their own" near the end, but doesn't address my point of public vs. private blockchain, or how this token would be in any way different to a regular fiat currency.
Rather than posting barely related links and changing the subject, perhaps you should try addressing people's points directly, Mr. Clever Economist.

Right I'm gonna post what I've got so far, cause these numbers are doing my head in. OP, can you give us a clue on the numbers? Maybe say what base system you are using, or point out a key equation? :D
Pretty sure I have all the letters in the private key correct, numbers have been replaced with bold symbols:
So we have 7 symbols, and 6 unique symbols. At first I thought that !=4 and  because one of the equations (6th one down from the left) is  (or 21x21=441). The one underneath is llxll=l (11x11=121) which also made sense. But as I went through, things started not making sense.
0=0 for sure, and I think l = 1. But if we're dealing with a number system that is not base 10, the other equations I just wrote would be nonsense.
I thought I worked out the symbol for 3 (7th equation down in column 2 is llxl and I thought 11x121=1331). But again, this seems wrong now.
OP, this is fiendish!

I'm a bit late to the party, but there is actually an interesting law in the UK, which was part of the [RIPA]( legislation which **"requires persons to decrypt information and/or supply keys to government representatives to decrypt information without a court order."**
Obscene, I know. But essentially you can be imprisoned (for up to 2 years, 5 years in cases involving national security), for simply refusing to give the police your password/private key.
Of course there are ways around this - hidden wallets or hidden computer partitions are two examples that would work, with dummy wallets containing small amounts. 
Not a lot of people know about this law, and I believe there are similar laws in other countries. Not the USA though, because of the 5th Amendment I guess?
Moral of the story is, make sure you protect yourself if you live in a country has bullshit laws like this. 
Re: the hacker in the story, it does say that there is still £1.5m untraced. So the £0.5m probably was "seized" (due to the guy giving up his password/private keys as required by law, and probably recommended by his lawyer for more a more lenient sentence). Whether the hacker has access to the rest is unknown.

 Y * X = (Y-z)Y
P * X = (P-z)P

I thought I'd have a little go at finding your message, haven't had much luck though. Tried converting various PUSHDATA hex code to ASCII. 
The tx amount is oddly specific (.00009001) so I think this might be a clue. But I've tried converting both that, the change amount (.003254) and the total output (.00334401) from hex to ASCII, just to see what came up. Ended up with some random letters ("2T" for change, "3D" for total output. ALso "X%" for fee/byte.)
Found some text in the block hash saying who mined the block, but I'm pretty sure that's irrelevant unless you're the owner of a mining farm... Hmmm

What on Earth are you babbling on about?


I honestly don't really understand your point here. I am not talking about banks making money, on transactions or any other services. I am pointing out the huge energy consumption of the global banking system: Worldwide offices, card factories, datacentres, local branches, trading centres, and don't forget the energy for every one of the employees to get to and from work every day. There's probably more factors I'm missing, but the power consumption is gargantuan.
Fair enough on your point about banks still being an entity even if Bitcoin was more popular. But the freedom that Bitcoin can give the average person is extremely valuable, and arguably worth the electricity cost. 
Re: your second point, yes of course some farms are powered by coal plants. But like I said, farms will flock to the areas with the cheapest power, and the areas with excess power. These are becoming more and more likely to be renewable. It even says in the article you linked to:
"Computers in Iceland get power from geothermal plants. Even in China, some are clustered around hydroelectric facilities in Sichuan and Yunnan."
I could post hundreds of articles disputing your claim of bullshit on cheap renewables, but here's one:
And if you want more, here's a google search from the last month:
Someone posted a great article in this thread about this exact topic, I suggest you read it: 
There's also a great little speech by Andreas Antonopolous about this exact concern, I can't find a link right now but what he has to say is very interesting.

@_date: 2018-05-20 19:39:59
Also re: the Z letters, I was assuming that the symbol that looks like a square lower-case p was a "zz" sound, making the characters in the private key "z-ee". Being British, this threw me a bit because we call it "zed" haha.
Also there are some discrepancies - really if it's a "zz" sound then the word "users" at the start of paragraph 2 should have that character, but instead it uses the "elongated backwards Z" (which corresponds to an S. I figured by looking at some other words that contain that symbol (like "just" and "concepts") that this was probably a typo.

No. The only reason no-one would want to buy is if there was a fundamentally serious flaw in the protocol. Anyway, if there are no buyers then there are no sellers, so the price would remain at whatever it was when BTC was last traded. I don't think you understand quite how markets work.

True, also whenever I come across one of these types of threads there are normally 500-1000 comments already there, so it's futile to try and step in with some actual facts.
Of course there is a huge crossover of users who worry about the climate, and also have no clue about how bitcoin works or how much energy the current banking system (or other systems) actually use. 
I mean in that first thread in the image, many were using the manufacturing cost of physical cash to make a comparison to the Bitcoin network - It literally had not occurred to them that the banking system is exponentially more than just a banknote factory.
Not to mention no-one seemed to get the basic concept of mining farms clustering around areas with cheap power, either because there's excess power, or because it comes from renewables (which are getting cheaper all the time).
At least there are some news articles giving a more balanced story, even if they aren't as popular with the reddit hive-mind...

Good point - yeah I noticed that symbol earlier (said it looks a bit like a text cursor) and figured it might be useful. 
LIke you said, the result always has the same digit that's being  multiplied as the last digit - and, *the digit before always seems to be a "smaller/less complex version" of the symbol in question*. I think this is very important.

I think you might be missing the point. It's satire, it even says so in the title. It's using humour and absurdity to take the piss out of banks, and actually will probably educate some people too.
The idea of bankers actually trying to protest in this way is obviously ridiculous, that's the joke. But some people who aren't yet aware of certain things, could easily see this and think "yeah, come to think of it bankers would probably hate Bitcoin... Maybe I should look into it?"
I think it's pretty clever TBH.

I solved most of the letters I think, and mine are a little different to yours. Perhaps the "uu" should be "w" (double-u)?
Some of the letters you're missing are H, QB, ZV, Z, V, (symbol), ET, F, NMTG... I think. 
I'm having trouble with the numbers to be honest, it's some strange base system I think - there are loads of different symbols. I think I can sort the rest of the letters pretty quickly, so I'm gonna try and work out this number system.
If anyone wants to give any ideas about the numbers, feel free (I'm a bit stumped, but the "~~bracket~~" edit "text cursor" looking symbol might be important). I'll post the rest of the letters when I decipher them.

Fair enough, but you seemed to be conflating Keynesian currency manipulation with pegging, they are different things (as you've acknowledged), although they do indeed utilize similar methods. 
As for your Ponzi scheme definition, what you seem to be missing is that a true Ponzi has an actor/actors at the top that *promise* returns to investors (using the money from newer investors to pay the older investors). Obviously such a scheme is unsustainable. 
Bitcoin/crypto cannot be a Ponzi by definition, as no such actor/s exist. It *may be* an asset in a bubble, it may not. But it cannot be a Ponzi/pyramid scheme.

Maybe I'm missing something. Take one example in the text sample, the character that looks like a bridge with a circle on top. This seems to represent uppercase "I", lowercase "i" and lowercase "y".
But the private key contains this character, which is weird.
Some of the other characters seem to be phonetic sounds, rather than letters (the "ey" in "money" is the same as the "e" in "ecosystem").
Also the spelling of "users" and "units" is driving me insane. I thought the symbol that looks like a cursive "do" with a horizontal line above the "o" represented "n". It's at the end of the word Bitcoin, and the second letter of Introduction. So why is it in the word "users"? And why has the word "units" got a weird C-shaped symbol inbetween the "u" and the "n" sounds?
OP are you trolling us? Or am I just being dumb... :D
Edit: Ah OK I'm starting to get it, phonetics are important.

One of these similar puzzles went on for years: 
I remember one on BCTalk that took a few weeks for someone to get, it had multiple layers including a custom minecraft server where QR codes had been built into the game and you had to fly around and decipher them. And that wasn't even the final 'level'.
I wouldn't count on too many more clues, but he did say that he would be giving at least one more. This one seems more simple than the previous 2 I mentioned, but it will probably still take a while for someone to get it...

It's not really an example of Bitcoin doing anything bad though, fake exchange volume has been a thing for years - I remember when they started charging exchange fees on those big Chinese exchanges, and the volume dropped by like 80% over night...
As for the fact that the futures market can manipulate the price so easily, yeah that kinda sucks. But I guess it's a good chance to try and accumulate more while the price is artificially low? Everyone should know it's still a largely unregulated market, you just need to bear that in mind if you trade or use Bitcoin.

Sounds like a good plan mate, all the best! Too many people on this sub always say "It's ridiculous to go all in" without considering context. 
"All in" for a 50 yr old, who's accumulated half a million bucks in fiat over their life, with a shitty job, would be a bit dumb. In your situation it's smart if you ask me.
I did a similar thing a few years ago, sold some stuff and even took out an interest free (for 36 months) credit card loan to buy bitcoin, which I balance transferred to a new card after the time (for 0% again, and a small one-off fee). That means my current situation is I'm *over 100%* in Bitcoin (because I have fiat debt, and the BTC price is much higher now then when I bought). Sounds dumb, but if Bitcoin goes to zero it just means I'll have a shitty year or two, where I have to eat rice and save enough from my job to pay back my fiat debts. No interest, so I'm laughing in all honesty. I even cashed some out to treat myself to a sweet gaming PC during the bull run.
Strong hands my friend!

Don't rate an artist's work based on what you think about the artist themselves. Loads of actors, musicians and painters were right cunts, doesn't mean that the stuff they produced was bad.
Elon comes across as a douche to me, but you can't deny that Tesla is the pinnacle of consumer electric automotive tech. And to risk a design like the Cybertruck is brave, and also pretty counter-cultural (very much like Bitcoin).

Most people that got rich weren't necessarily dumb. They were either lucky, brave or intelligent enough to see the potential. Back when Bitcoin was worth double or low triple figures, you needed to have an obscure combination of knowledge to see the potential. I would say knowledge of computing, cryptography and economics would help, together with a libertarian/anti-authoritarian outlook. Also drugs. But drugs often go hand-in-hand with some of the other knowledge. Why do you think the FBI wanted to loosen drug laws to hire hackers?

I sold some bitcoin yesterday, it took less than 5 minutes from the initiation of the trade, for the money to be deposited into my bank account.

@_date: 2018-10-25 10:01:40


And that's why I'm holding. I'm not sure what history has to do with it, it's about fundamentals. If you (and enough other people) believe an asset has value, it probably won't just disappear like Bitconnect essentially has.
You could sell if you knew for a *fact* that an asset would continue dropping, but it's risky. I stand by the advice that "you only lose money if you sell", if that asset has merit. 
Of course, no asset really has objective value (everything is a risk), but to compare Bitcoin and Bitconnect is pretty ridiculous.

Seriously though, I love it too. I understand why some people don't like it, it's a controversial design - but to say zero design work has gone into it is plain wrong. 
They've incorporated the styling and aesthetics of older car designs (Lotus Esprit S1-3, Toyota MR2 Mk1, Audi Quattro, Merc G-Wagen, VW golf Mk1+2, maybe the Countach etc.), and retro sci-fi/cyberpunk cars (Blade Runner car, Ghost in the Shell car, Aliens APC etc.) into a modern vehicle. And they're good movies btw!
I don't like the way many newer cars look, they're too curved and refined, and lack the character of older boxier car designs - they all look the same. I think the Cybertruck looks incredible.

You're right, but I'm not sure if "willfully" is the right word to use - in hindsight of course it would have been better to sell 100% of my holdings, and buy back - But I honestly didn't know when the hype train would stop.
I actually took some profits at 14k on the way down, maybe 10% of my stash. But I'm in the lucky position of having got in early and still being &gt;1000% up overall, so I feel that the type of risk management you speak of is kind of irrelevant to me. In fact, I'd say the risk of selling too early is more dangerous than failing to sell (for someone in my position).

Eh, people's reasons for using it as currency vary - Some people like the pseudonymous aspect, some people like the empowerment of paying for things without incorporating any banks/CC companies etc. Some like to use it as a middle finger to "the man", some want to increase adoption by buying things and supporting vendors which accept it. 
Some people bought low and now have significant amounts of BTC, and want to buy stuff without the bullshit of converting back to fiat. Maybe some want to keep their funds a little under the radar. There are many reasons really.
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:35:24
Not zero sense at all, it's mathematically the best way to value the asset - it makes a lot more sense than valuing the asset "per coin", which is what everyone seems to do. The lost coins are just a variable that need to be taken into account.

Yep: higher market cap, and more than ten times the trading volume compared to back then, like you said.

It's not fake, it's a logarithmic scale (as opposed to a linear scale). And log scales can be very useful when tracking certain things, for example the price of BTC, because it's value has gone up by so much in a short space of time.
However, it's just one way of looking at the data. I do think the graph would be better if the y-axis had labelled logs of 10 in the scale, rather than random numbers (ie, 10^(1), 10^(2), 10^(3) etc.)
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:46:10
Sats not flats.
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:13:42
I think that it should have a clear title stating that it is a log scale (rather than just a small log indicator in the bottom right corner), and as I said I prefer powers of 10 on the y-axis (10, 100, 1000, 10,000 and so on) for clarity. 
However logarithmic scale graphs are really nothing new - It may be misleading to people who don't understand how a log scale works? 
Some data can be more easily interpreted in a log scale, some non-Bitcoin examples would be the dB scale and the Richter scale. Day-to-day crypto price graphs tend to work better on a linear scale chart, but in fact the log scale can show interesting information when looking at longer periods. 
Try plotting the BTC price from day 1 to today, on a linear chart - Most of the insane bubbles of the past just look like tiny bumps, because the most recent one was so much bigger. So I would say a log scale is better for this, because all the previous bubbles are easily seen and compared. 
Of course, if you are unfamiliar with log scale graphs then it might look misleading, but hey why not learn right now?

Unless you have free electricity, the simple answer is no. I could go into a lot more detail about stuff like ASICs vs altcoin GPU mining, expected ROI time and setup costs, and what mining actually entails... But basically no, don't bother. 
If you want to find out more about it check out some of Andreas Antonopoulos' videos or read some articles.

Oh man, you made a really well thought out comment so I have to respond. My remark about your life was a shitty joke, sorry about that. I just felt like there are so many more important things to get offended about/be opposed to, than something like this. I know that's a fallacy (fallacy of relative privation?), but to be honest you show some fallacies in your argument as well.
For a start, you're using a slippery slope argument to try and say that mouse racing is immoral, because other industries involving animal racing sometimes allow abuse of animals. Sure, it's *possible* that an industry might spring up around this mouse-racing, and the mice *might* get abused. But that's totally hypothetical.
Secondly, mice are arguably less sentient than dogs and horses, they are also used in cruel animal experiments to help us with medical science (which I believe is a sacrifice worth making). And in this racing scenario, they are not being mistreated - in fact (as the other poster said) they are being allowed to run around, be fed and generally have much more comfort than a wild mouse might have. So your point about me justifying this by simply saying "it's fun" is false, I do think it's fun but I also believe these creatures are being treated *better* than the majority. 
As someone that eats meat yourself, I'm inclined to believe you may be a bit of a hypocrite - You probably eat pigs or chickens that have been raised in much worse circumstances compared to wild animals. I mean, I have too, I'm not judging you. But it seems a bit disingenious to then get worked up over some mice that are running about (something they do in their natural habitat).
Whatever man, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree... Because like I said I think this is a great idea.
@_date: 2019-02-24 10:08:33
I'm not saying it's a useful graph (the timing and $ range is dumb from a TA perspective). 
But I doubt you'd get the 'long wicks' upwards, even if the time was shifted by 30 seconds. The reason the long wicks are at the bottom of the candles is probably because there are large market sells being bought by bots/lower buy orders, so the price dips very briefly and then recovers. Of course there's a chance that the minute will end just as the price hits the bottom, but it's very unlikely.
And there's probably strong resistance just below $4040, making it hard for the price to go any higher.
That's my take anyway, but yeah I don't know why I'm spending my time trying to figure out a useless chart such as this :P
@_date: 2019-06-15 10:44:13
Oh my god your life must be terrible. I'm sorry.
But seriously, some people just thought it would be fun to race some mice? I think it's great. This is not some corporate overarching industry, it's literally a bunch of people that thought it would be fun to race some mice and allow people to bet on it. I wish I'd thought of this, it's a bloody brilliant idea.

Okay, let's assume this article is true. (For a start, it's certainly true that Bitcoin mining congregates in areas with cheap power, which tend to be areas with renewable power, or surplus power that would otherwise go to waste. So your "limited natural resources" argument is moot).
Secondly, Bitcoin is only a waste of power if you *believe* that the system is useless.

OK, I get how that would work but how do they know which wallet to check for the total consolidated amount, I suppose they just scanned the blockchain for any wallets with a similar amount and tracked it from there?
Seems like a bit of a sketchy way to trace coin, but I guess if a certain amount went in (like 180,123.42009 BTC) and the new wallet gained that exact amount then it's easy to follow. This is potentially a flaw in coin mixing systems that I hadn't though about before - I guess if you were to send the coin to several wallets after, then it would be impossible to track.

It's like finding a dinosaur fossil when you're a kid, and then having to pay money for it when it becomes apparent that it's valuable, but without selling it. Of course CGT would apply if the funds were realized, but surely the mining tax would only apply on the value of the asset at the time of mining?

Video game items are different like you said, at the bare minimum you get a skin or some cosmetic upgrade which I guess some people like so they can look unique in-game, I think those are dumb but not a scam. Actual useful items like swords, spaceships or DLC which unlocks new maps/missions etc. certainly result in increased enjoyment of the game - that's not silly at all IMO - it's like buying an attachment for your hunting rifle, or buying the sequel to a movie you like.
Reddit coins are a scam because their main point is obviously to increase the revenue of the site, and they give you barely anything in return. I guess some people enjoy receiving fake internet gold, I can understand that more than the people who buy the gold in the first place.

I mean, you're kinda right - the US does have a habit of interfering and it mostly doesn't end well. Same goes for the UK (where I'm from) and a few other countries.
But to be honest, we only tend to do it when there's some sort of geopolitical/economic gain for our country. So, if people donate money through official channels, or our governments donate money/weapons/assets, it seems to benefit the ruling powers (and not necessarily the people that need it).
It would be nice if we could help the people in some of these struggling countries, without involving any rulers. Bitcoin could help with this I think. It wouldn't be as simple as just sending BTC to random people, but being able to bypass government and bank barriers is a step in the right direction.

Are you *on* drugs? No-one is smuggling anything through customs other than information in their head. There is literally no need for any physical thing to be actually taken through customs. 
That's like saying that if someone *thinks about buying drugs* as they walk through customs, then it's smuggling.

Wow, you seem really dense. If I had $1m worth of bitcoin, and a private key in my head, that doesn't somehow make it illegal for me to cross any international borders. I'm not actually taking anything through customs, so I won't be arrested for anything.
Do you seriously think that this would be illegal? I'd *love* to see the law which states this.
Is it also illegal to take a bank card across an international border if I have $1m in my account? (That was a rhetorical question, of course it's not, and it's a much better analogy for what you're implying).

Well yes, but what this doesn't address is how much capital the attacker would need to initiate the 51% attack, and how quickly they would need to offload their BTC before the price tanked. Also what would they do with the thousands of useless ASICs afterwards? It would be incredibly risky and difficult to pull off.
As for the idea that mining pools could conspire to pull off a 51%, I find this far more plausible. But I'm honestly not sure why they would do it - it would devalue their holdings and cut off the stream of income they currently generate. And the problems of market liquidity and speed of selling BTC would apply to them as well, the only difference would be they don't need to buy hardware.
I thought this article would be about something more serious than a 51% attack! Seems many people still know sweet FA about Bitcoin...

It's a "normal distribution" graph, and I suspect the "buckets of adoption" are based on similar sectors of other new technologies that occurred in the past. 
Sure, it's not gonna be 100% accurate, but it gives us an idea of adoption potential. Of course, like someone else mentioned the percentages could be related to "target population" instead of "world population", but the graph still has merit.

I'm honestly starting to get really annoyed with the main criticism of Bitcoin being that it's "a speculative vehicle, only existing for people to try and make money". I've heard it from loads of people IRL, and on many "news" sites.
Yeah, no fucking shit it's used as a speculative vehicle! What do you expect from an asset that has grown 1000s of percent in a few years, *of course people will speculate on its value.*
It is an inevitable result of the increase in value, and anyone who has studied Bitcoin could have told you years ago that this would happen if it took off. It would be incredibly weird if people *weren't* speculating on it.
Therefore, along with the dumb "environmental disaster" arguments, it's an invalid and illogical criticism.

Have you got any actual argument for it being a "bubble"? I agree that you should be careful stepping into it, but if you look at volatility in terms of percentage, the current fluctuations really aren't that crazy.
Maybe it is a bubble, but you should show some evidence before claiming the fact.
IMO it could easily go to 10,000 in the next few months, or drop back to 2 or 3k.
But it's not going anywhere, I highly doubt it will drop below 2k. The more likely scenario is +10k within 1 year.

I wouldn't say it's anti-capitalist, more like anti-crony-capitalist. I would say in fact that it glorifies anarcho-capitalism as a political ideology; it shows how powerful corporations can skew society into accepting their ideas, and thus how the power is really in the hands of the people (if they choose to take it).
And I don't think the protagonist is as you describe. Your opinion is that he is a "horrible person, a whiny little snowflake millenial".
My opinon is that he is a troubled, schizophrenic individual, but intelligent and morally sound. He tries to use his abilities to make the world a better place, but gets sucked in way out of his depth, in terms of political and corporate power.
The story is told quite metaphorically, we are seeing it mostly through the eyes of the protagonist so everything on screen is not always factual. The show uses the idea of the protagonist narrating to the viewer in a very clever, insightful way in my opinion - It puts the viewer directly into his brain and uses this device to tell the story in a unique fashion.
I can understand why some people might not be into it, but I love it.

I doubt it's the miners, they already have a mathematically based theory of profit.
People are speculating on the value of a new, innovative asset. Look at 's comment below. Bitcoin has many attributes that no other currency possesses. The value is based on the ingenuity of the protocol.
And yes, of course a lot of this value is based on speculating a higher price in the future. But this is educated speculation, not just a random gamble.
Many people believe in this shit right now...

Eh, some economists/media outlets certainly think that way. But bashing Bitcoin for its environmental impact has also become a clickbaity way of getting pageviews on your site, while also making you seem "environmentally aware".
It works well because few people understand Bitcoin, so it's seen as something pointless by many. So you have a "pointless" thing which is using a lot of power, which is easily spun into a story which puts Bitcoin in a bad light. And everyone loves controversy.
Also, the big picture is quite complex, including things like hardware efficiency/mining farm distribution/power arbitrage/renewable penetration etc. Rebutting an argument such as "OMG Bitcoin releases as much CO2 as Ireland!" requires a long answer. A lot of people probably can't be bothered to read past the headline...

Possible, there is some evidence that the authorities have their fingers in some of the drug markets...
However, I believe this was more a case of "Do what this guy did, go to prison for life". He was made an example of to dissuade anyone else from defying the government in such a manner (especially considering the libertarian/anti-authoritarian angle on what he was doing - it wasn't a crime against any individual, it was a crime against governmental constructs, verging on anarchy).
In my opinion, the actual crimes he commited were trivial, but the ideology behind them is what led to the sentence.
But as we can see, money talks. Hence the ploriferation of darknet markets.

Ok I see what you're getting at now, sorry I mistook you for a troll - it's just you have a very odd, roundabout way of explaining what you mean.
I don't see how a decentralized system of value tranfer could possibly work, without a protocol of some sort that is agreed on by the participants. 
If you want to define the Bitcoin system as "centralized" just because it has a central protocol then you're free to do so, but that's not the definition that everyone else is using so you're going to be misunderstood.

OK I see what you're getting at, it's a kind of decentralized socialist system, with sharing of resources. It's a great idea, but surely there needs to be an underlying protocol, or a system of laws or rules to stop people cheating.
We all know what happens when a socialist system is controlled by a small group of people, so I guess the laws option is a bad one. So there has to be another way to do it.
I think the "Star Trek" style utopia of no money is very far away, our species would probably have to evolve for this to work. But maybe your idea could work with underlying cryptography making sure the system is fair. 
I really like the idea, I guess one problem is how do we actually track certain resources, without compromising privacy of users. Sure, apples are not that hard - slap a NFC chip in the sticker, or even just a QR code. And information about who needs apples is probably not that valuable. But when you start tracking *all* the resources, things get a bit messy and this information might be very useful to governments/corporations/hackers etc.

They rely on actual feedback from buyers. I agree with your case for legalised/regulated drugs, but the darknet sites are a step in the right direction - If someone wants drugs, they can buy from a vendor that has positive reputation and feedback. This encourages pure product, and therefore is good for harm reduction. It is a form of "self-regulation" that does not occur on the streets.
If I wanted to buy drugs, I would prefer to buy from a darknet vendor with hundreds of good reviews, than a street dealer - that's not faith, it's simply common sense.

I read quickly through the paper, and to be fair the guy has done some research, and I understand the premise. But I have a couple of problems - firstly he seems to underestimate the current power of the network, and makes a lot of assumptions about the "future power/price of ASIC chips". 
Also, how does he think a short-sell attack would actually work with this much money? Let's say the market cap increases to $500B, and someone thinks they can 51% the network for $400B. Therefore they have to get $400B+ from their short sell. Firstly, I doubt any exchange could even afford to pay them (they would just go bankrupt/close the short). Secondly, wouldn't this raise some huge red flags with governments/LE? Would it even be legal?
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:04:51
Agree 100%, we shouldn't get complacent - anything can fail - even if something has been "antifragile" for 10 years, doesn't mean it isn't vulnerable to a new attack vector.

In particular the classic tessellating bird&gt;fish works, the fractal-like lizards and the Moebius Strip with the ants.

You totally missed all of my points, or you're just trolling. I don't have time to rebutt all your points right now, but I may reply in detail tomorrow. Just a few for now:


No, they're governed by the protocol, which is open source and democratic - if enough miners/nodes disagree they can fork the network by writing new code.


No they change at the will of the whole network, as I just stated. There is no governing entity.


The WWW, not the Internet.


What are you on about? That's not what centralization means, the whole point of decentralized systems is not that they don't follow rules, it's that they are not controlled by a single entity. The two concepts are totally unrelated. A decentralized network with no rules is simply nonsense. The whole reason a decentralized network can work at all is because all participants *have* to follow certain rules.

That's disingenuous and you know it. When people talk of a "central authority" they are describing a person/group of people that has influence over something, and that can change the nature of an entity by will alone. 
Also, you just totally shifted the goalposts. You started by saying "a smaller team of developers, miners, and node runners are there, lurking, running the Great and Powerful Oz.", and now you're saying the protocol itself is the "central authority". MAke your mind up. 
Does HTTP control the web? Do MP3s control the music industry?

Are you being deliberately obtuse? Of course not, the review would say "I tested this with the following reagent kits and found that the vendor is not selling what he claims to be"
Or, "WARNING - My friend ODd on this shit"
I already talked about the murder for hire charges, they were not involved in his sentencing. As for money laundering, well that does have some merit, but computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics is not implied. As far as I know, he did not traffic drugs in any large quantity, and didn't hack anyone. 
Even if he did traffic drugs in small quantities, the whole Silk Road program was objectively saving lives and offering harm reduction. Morally, I don't think the guy did much wrong. Did he break the law? Of course, but a double life sentence is fucking ridiculous. There are murderers and rapists that get less than 10 years in prison, and in my opinion they are much worse individuals than Ulbricht.

Good. Whether or not the messages were real/fake/had real motive behind them, *so many people* believe that he was imprisoned due to these charges. It comes up in literally every thread where Ulbricht is mentioned.
Hopefully this will allow many people to see through the charade, and recognise that this is just another case where someone is being "made an example of", to try and stop others from doing the same thing... Oh wait, the dark web drug scene is just as active (if not more) than it was when Ulbricht got caught.
Hmmm. Maybe people just *want* to buy drugs, and it's easier to buy them from an online marketplace than to trust a random guy in the street. Maybe it's actually safer - how many people have died from fake Xanax bars laced with fentanyl recently... You think that shit would fly on a reputable dark website? The bad reviews would probably get the vendor banned within a week.

Hey, thanks for the reply. You state some valid points and have given me some things to think about. 
You argue that QE can be considered "less unfair" than a depression. I suppose you *could* be right, but this is a hard point to give evidence for, as the only examples we have are old market crashes that happened before there was a huge derivative market propping up currency markets. This kind of ties in with your point about the 2008 crash. It is pretty common knowledge that the crash was a result of fraudulently valued, 'stacked' derivatives and credit ratings that were falsely represented. 


Yes, that's exactly what I meant. And I believe it *is* more artificial than aspects of currency because it leads investors to make more investments, and riskier investments, because they believe a crash would be less likely, with the QE "safety net" (and I'm inclined to believe them). With Bitcoin, the market cap is already set into the protocol so there is no safety net. 
You probably saw the wobbles in the market when the Fed announced the tapering of its QE program. This is evidence that some of the confidence in the markets is artificially propped up by the idea of QE.


OK, I take your point here - QE definitely eased the pain of the 2008 crash. However, the crash was a result of the derivatives and misleading ratings that I mentioned earlier. I guess this is not so much a point against QE, but more simply an argument in favour of the Austrian school of thought - ie we should let markets naturally assume their own value, based on the collective belief in their worth.
As to my point about greater market cap and liquidity, well I believe that this is true - many of the currencies with the largest market cap and liquidity show the least volatility - put simply, it's harder for an entity to move the price of an asset or currency when they need more of that asset or currency to do so. This seems obvious to me, maybe I'm missing something?
Although we saw a huge market crash in 2008, this is not evidence that bigger market cap/liquidity does not prevent volatility. All it is, is an example of a large market that *did* experience volatility.
My counter evidence would be simply looking at the value of the currencies/assets in the world that have the highest market cap, and noting that they experience low volatility, and specifically their volatility is over long periods of time. The ones with lower market cap and liquidity are more volatile over shorter periods of time.


When people need food, they buy food. When they need a car, they buy a car. Fuel, shelter, clothes, same deal. People don't spend their money because they think it will be worth less tomorrow, they spend because they need or want something. 
As an example, look at all the depreciating assets normal people buy - phones/computers/cars etc. They quite often don't need these things (or at least they don't need to spend as much as they do on them). 
Assets like new cars and phones have huge depreciation - probably between 10% and 30% in the first year of ownership, yet people buy them. They are exchanging a currency with 1-5% inflation for assets with much higher depreciation.
Granted, if the currency had a *guaranteed* large deflation rate, perhaps people would hold off on buying that 2nd car that they don't need. But:
A. An deflation rate of currency is never guaranteed.
B. I believe if they held off on buying that 2nd car for a year, and their currency had increased significantly in value, they would buy a better car.
I have to admit, I don't have much hard evidence for this idea that a deflationary currency is a good thing, but I just don't accept the arguments to the contrary... They seem illogical to me. If you have any evidence where this has actually happened (a deflationary currency causing a significant economic crash) I'd love to read about it.


Point taken. However I think you are a being a little hyperbolic. Bitcoin will not be a replacement for a currency such as the USD for many years (if ever). But there may be other ways of preventing depressions other than classical QE.
Just a mad thought, but how about some sort of universal basic income? Instead of sending the QE money directly into the financial markets, it could be distributed evenly between the population. People would then spend the money directly, stimulating the economy. Bit socialist, but hey at least it would be fairer right?

Interesting. Not a lot that wasn't already known (eg. CGT is applied to crypto profits upon disposal, which includes not only selling for cash but also exchange for goods or services).
But some interesting clarification on net losses - they can be reported and reduce overall CGT if assets are being disposed. 
Also interesting that they specify that mining income is taxed on an income tax basis. This makes it a bit annoying if you are a miner that makes a lot of money and disposes of cryptoassets on a regular basis, because you can be stung for Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax...

Your reasoning is illogical - why do you talk about stocks, and then just throw gold in at the end? Gold is way more similar to Bitcoin than it is to stocks.
The only infrastructure gold has is the "Real Stuff" *required* to mine/sell/transport/store it. It's not like a business which produces assets.
Your prediction is bold, I personally believe that, in this scenario, many people will flock to gold *and* Bitcoin, and also other diverse assets like land/property etc. 
Bitcoin has some extremely useful properties for many people in countries that restrict capital flight, and if there is a 50% drop in the stock market, the fallout will be fully global. If you were a HNWI in China/Russia/India etc, you'd honestly have to be pretty dumb *not* to put 1-10% of your assets into Bitcoin. At least.

While this concept of the ledger "not being finished" (as you put it) is a possibility, it would involve a huge number of miners all ceasing activity at the same time, so the network is attempting to mine blocks at a higher difficulty level than is optimal. This would slow the mining process for a short time, before the difficulty re-adjusts. Then more miners turn back on because the lower difficulty makes it profitable again. It's a self-regulating system.
But the chances of this are super low, there are too many miners for them to conceivably all decide to stop at the same time. All that would happen (and we've seen this in other coins, and in Bitcoin to a certain extent) is that the block time would increase a little for a short time.
You say that alts might take over because of this? Well the exact same issue faces all coins, so if Bitcoin drops to near zero, it won't be from the price of electricity, it would be for some other reason. Your argument is a bit convoluted.

I just thought it was interesting, because in my opinion heroin is no different from any other drug - it is a choice that people make to put heroin into their body, the same as LSD or marijuana. It has no effect on anyone else (no matter how addictive it is).
Weapons can be useful tools in the right hands, or they can be dangerous to others in the wrong hands. However it is still the human that pulls the trigger.
Sex slaves are in a whole other category altogether, most people (including myself) would say that sexual exploitation like that is abhorrent. 
The point is, all these things existed before Bitcoin, and would still exist if Bitcoin was wiped out. Taaki's point is that the ideology of Bitcoin should primarily help to build a better world without government intervention. The example of the original Silk Road is a good one - after establishing itself it began to self-regulate, and for example banned child pornography. It also banned weapons sales from its main site. This is a great example of how a marketplace under no government control, regulated itself in an objectively moral manner.
This is what Taaki is getting at, even with no government justice and threat of punishment, a community can facilitate illegal activity, yet be morally sound. And that is something that Bitcoin can help with.

The custom background function on Trezors is fun, I went with this: [

A Keynesian in our midst, eh? Begone, scourge of the Austrian school!
Seriously though, while I agree that policies like QE can have benefits, I would argue that the drawbacks of the system outweigh them. QE is unfair on the general population as the money does not seem to be "filtering down", and merely encourages banks to make greater risks with their money, for personal profit. It also allows for more currency manipulation. Another downside is that it creates a false stock market belief, and affects investment in company stocks and shares.
Your point about volatility affecting the everyday price of goods and services is valid, however the idea is that once there is enough market cap and liquidity in Bitcoin, this volatility should decrease. And not many people are expecting Bitcoin to be a replacement for fiat currency anyway, at least not for many years.
There are many other downsides to QE, such as constant inflation (which i don't believe is a good thing - I don't buy the "hoarding" theory, where people continue to hoard a deflating currency/asset, supposedly crashing the economy). I could go on, but in summary I believe the Keynesian system is flawed, and creates a kind of "crony capitalism" whereby banks, investors and rich people in general benefit, while the majority are worse off.
You are correct in saying that "Bitcoin by design has no method of managing those swings." However, I would argue that this is a feature, not a bug.

Good point, maybe some people did make the same mistake as me!

To be fair, he didn't say "*mainly* fueled", so it's a bit misleading but not wrong.

It's not about the actual transaction, it's about the ideology behind the technology. You can use it to send a few billion CNY out of the meddling government's hands, your mate can buy a gram of MDMA with it, I can buy a motorbike in Cambodia with it, drive to a ranch and shoot a rocket launcher at a cow. All without government intervention.
Stop getting caught up in what's right or wrong, according to society/government. Bitcoin is freedom, and we need to get back to that ideology - that's what Taaki is trying to say.
