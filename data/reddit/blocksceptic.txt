21 years ago there were trivial denial of service bugs in Windows and other operating systems.  [Ping of death]( is just one of many examples.

Anerica has a somewhat unique tax deferrment scheme for capital gains - if you want to reinvest your gains, you can defer paying the tax until you sell the reinvested asset, until you decide not to reinvest.
Also, length of time matters because inflation. It should be indexed, but working that out is too hard, so instead they just give you a big discount if you’ve sold something you held more then a year.

In the long term, if the applications materialize, I think we're in for a lot more than $10k per bitcoin.  But do not underestimate how big of an IF that is.
For the short term, I don't think the fundamentals to support that price are there yet, so I've taken my profit while I can.  I'm still holding a small amount as a hedge in case I'm wrong.
I'm almost as excited as you by the potential - but at this stage it's just that - potential.  [Don't invest recklessly]( has some great advice IMO, and [I made a comment]( about the wider financial system that I would encourage you to read.

I won't be buying any more BTC unless it goes back below 5k.  I think we need to accept that it could drop below 1k though.

It’s also worth noting that bitcoin didn’t exist at the time of the last financial crisis and we don’t know how the price will react to an external shock.  While many of us are interested in bitcoin to insulate us from shocks in the wider financial system and by extension assume it will do well in a crisis much like gold, we don’t actually know this.
One of the effects of the 2008 crisis was to cause people to de-leverage - selling off high-risk high-reurn investments to pay down debt or make lower risk investments

I'm probably too late here for this to be seen, but I want to raise this point anyway because I think it's important and I haven't seen it talked about at all.
Many of us, myself included, are interested in bitcoin at least partially because of its deflationary nature.  But in the short term we're still years away from the point where new bitcoins are no longer being created.
It seems to be widely accepted that shocks to the wider financial system will be good for the price of bitcoin, similar to how gold has historically gone up in a crisis.  In my opinion, this should not be assumed - bitcoin did not even exist at the time of the most recent major crisis in 2008.  
The 2008 crisis [brought Madoff's ponzi scheme]( to the ground.  I raise this not to compare bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme, but to point out that one of the effects of a crisis would likely be that people want to sell off high-risk investments that are doing well to pay down debt.
What happens if there's a 2008-level shock and you lose your job?  Can you still make your mortgage payments without dipping into your bitcoin?

It should work but you may need to set a custom [derivation path](  If you get this wrong, it will appear to work but you won't see any bitcoins in your wallet, so don't panic!

What about it?

Okay.  Let me have a go.
The current run-up in the price is unprecedented.  On the surface, it's driven in part by a growing awareness of crypto currencies (in the past two weeks I have helped two people who had never paid any attention to it before buy small amounts of bitcoin) combined with a fear-of-missing-out from true believers.  Some of these true believers are interested in crypto because of the social and political implications, but many see it as an opportunity to get rich quickly.
If you dig deeper, there's a lot of shadiness going on.  Aside from ICOs, shitcoins and schemes like Bitconnect, the current situation with Tether and Bitfinex I find extremely concerning.  I don't want to get into it too much other than to say that, with the issues raised and the importance of Bitfinex/Tether to the crypto ecosystem, the burden of proof should be on them to answer the issues or at least provide a compelling explanation as to why they can't.
I've watched a lot of Andreas Antonopoulos' talks.  He is an incredibly smart guy, probably smarter than me. But from my perspective, having travelled and lived in more than one place, including places with vastly more modern payment systems than the USA, I'm sceptical of bitcoin and cryptos as the future of money.  It could be - and there may be applications that it enables which are simply not possible under existing payment systems - but those applications do not exist today.
Now - the 21 million BTC question - Can the current price be maintained by the combination of existing speculators, new enterants, and possibly also fraud until the demand from real world applications catch up?  Because when you describe it like that it's starting to sound a lot like a bubble or worse.
It COULD happen.  Such a thing would be unprecedented - but there are a lot of unprecedented things about cryptocurrencies.  I haven't even seen anyone talking about how mining throws traditional econ-101 supply-and-demand on its head, but that's a topic for another post.
But far more likely the price comes crashing down.  Possibly to sub $1000 levels.  In my non-expert opinion, this is the far more likely short to medium term outcome.
With all that said -you could do a lot worse than the general advice of DCA'ing some amount you can afford to lose to buy bitcoin, then storing it on a Trezor.  But please don't stake your financial future on it.
For myself, I just sold the bulk of my coins and am redirecting the funds to other investments.

Sold around 75% of my holdings at 10k.  Made my peace that it could easily get to 20k or 30k in this cycle.  Not mad.

Well I'm not a coiner, but the OP I replied to seemed to think that credit ratings agencies being incentivised to not look closely at the products the banks were asking them to rate, was a problem caused by too much, rather than too little regulation.
Personally I'm inclined to think that laws like Dodd-Frank don't go far enough, and we're about to lose that...
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:28:27
Nope. But I'm arguing it's probably not a good idea to unilaterally declare they don't apply to you.

The customers of the ratings agencies were the banks, and the ratings agencies were doing exactly what the banks wanted.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:49:45
And whose job is it, pray tell, to check that the credit ratings agencies are doing their job?

2. Sit in jail charged with contempt of court for refusing to give up my private key.

The bankers probably knew the ratings were BS, but my point is they relied on them to sell MBS to pension funds and other investors who thought they were buying AAA rated debt that could never fail.


Don't know if I'd phrase it like that, but there was definitely a failure of AIG to do due diligence on what they were insuring.


If the scheme is batty, regulators should be empowered to put a stop to it.

Once law enforcement, knowing your identity, suspects you of having bitcoins and thinking they have a claim to those bitcoins, you're screwed. They'll charge you with making a false statement on top of whatever they originally suspected you of.
