No it doesn't, because I'll have to pay you $1 if I lose the bet, and you'll declare bankruptcy if you lose the bet.

Context? Some of us don't spend every day on @_date: 2014-02-25 07:57:34
I feel I should point out: there's quite a low limit to how many transactions can fit in a block. Miners will prefer the highest bidders. When we get decent transaction volumes, it's going to mean you have to pay a high price just to get your transaction included.
$2-$4 transactions are not going to be viable. At least not in the way they are now.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:13:43


I have. I keep an open mind, even to criticism phrased as insult.

They send you bitcoin. You don't send them goods.
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:19:26


No, that's not a long time. *No one* has been watching bitcoin for a long time. Not even Satoshi.
@_date: 2011-06-30 09:04:14
Let's be clear though: trojans mining bitcoins *are* good for the network. The more *different* miners there are, the harder it is for any one (e.g. deepbit) to control more than half the network.
@_date: 2011-06-15 10:29:24
Don't expect people to buy things for bitcoins that they wouldn't be willing to buy for cash.
And don't be surprised if that means there's nothing they're willing to buy for bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-07-18 12:13:39
I was thinking more along the lines of a website selling a web service in BTC, and paying for hosting, etc. in BTC.
@_date: 2011-07-18 10:32:02
(I agree with you, but)
Actually it can be a stable long-term way to describe the value of goods.
This will happen when people are selling goods in bitcoins, but also paying their costs in bitcoins. Then they can – and will want to – keep their price (in Bitcoin) constant, even though the exchange rate fluctuates.
I'm sure that's a while off though.
@_date: 2011-09-05 21:53:05
That's not supply. The supply that effects the price is the number of bitcoins (old or new) that people want to sell, not the number of bitcoins being created.
@_date: 2011-06-16 08:13:58




The second paragraph is a much weaker argument than the first. Day traders can only take profits once. I also don't think the long-term investors will sell at $30, $35 or so.
@_date: 2011-06-03 22:47:40
Actually it started at 0 BTC/USD. So it's really up infinity%.
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:50:24
You can trace it, forever. But it won't help you.
@_date: 2011-06-12 10:56:11
I bought a few bitcoins to keep indefinitely. I'll keep them until they become worthless, or I actually need them for something.
@_date: 2011-06-06 17:52:22
By whom?
@_date: 2011-06-02 09:20:52
There are two ways to look at this:
1. It's wasted.
2. It's used to create inflation in the BitCoin currency.
(Yes, everyone always talks about deflation in BitCoin, but that only comes once the mining *stops*. In the mean time, mining is like printing money: finding bitcoins through mining makes all the other bitcoins worth less.)
@_date: 2011-06-30 09:07:19
If the coins don't belong to the botnet owner, then they belong to the people who's computers are infected.

No, you can pay someone else who understands, and there is an effective employment market for such people.
And Mt. Gox should be able to afford them.
And Mt. Gox should recognise all of the above.

What? It reads like bullshit to me.


... okay ...


... okay ...


... actually, the majority of the computing power, not a majority of the generals. Most bitcoin users contribute nothing to the collective proof-of-work, but okay ...


... okay ... but wait, where was the bit about how this allows the generals to be sure that a majority of them are will invade the city?
This doesn't look like a solution to the Byzantine Generals' problem to me.

Cross site request forgery is *not* a problem with a ton of websites. At least not websites where there's anything more valuable to protect than privacy.
What I'm getting at is this is a very severe type of flaw that is very easy to stop. The really should know better.
@_date: 2011-06-12 12:20:57
It's back at 17.5 now.
@_date: 2011-06-11 22:29:04
What's the problem? Are you saying you want the price of bitcoin to be even higher? Why?
Anyway, if what you've said is true, why don't you make some money off it: deposit money on Mt. Gox, but on Sundays, and sell on Tuesdays.
@_date: 2011-12-31 00:10:26
Care to define it then?
@_date: 2011-06-18 07:48:01
In order of importance:
1. Secure your computer (antivirus, firewalls, etc.)
2. Don't keep your money on a third party website like Mt. Gox
3. Don't keep your money unencrypted anywhere, except temporarily when you spend it.
I think that'll do for the majority of attacks. I.e. the ones that aren't specifically targeted at *you*.
@_date: 2011-06-11 22:32:32
No, **don't hang tight; sell!* Just because you lost half your life savings on a super-high-risk investment is no reason to risk what's left. It's no better investment decision now than it was before.
@_date: 2011-06-18 08:18:49
Shit no. You hire a consultant, and you give them access to your source code, and you give them access to your internal test site with no live customer data. You do not give them access to the production system.
If they're changing your code, you have code reviews by employees you trust (yourself if necessary), to ensure the changes are for the better.
Or, if you don't trust your own internal process to maintain the privacy of customer data and quality of source code, you have them do external [penetration testing](
This stuff can be done. You just have to take it very seriously.

@_date: 2011-05-01 01:05:55
So does everyone else who has significant funds in BTC. When the market starts to fall, who do you think is going to buy your BTC?
@_date: 2011-07-20 11:36:29
0.1BTC is too much. For beta, it should be a really insignificant amount. Also, can't you just load-test it yourself? (I.e. with your own addresses.)
@_date: 2011-06-22 21:39:09
If I was Mt Gox, I'd disappear right now, say I'm bankrupt, but keep everyone's money.
@_date: 2011-06-06 12:17:27
If you don't plan on selling any time soon, then by the time you do sell, there will probably be much better options.
**tl;dr:** Don't worry about it.
@_date: 2011-09-18 17:03:59


But you'd be silly, given you could wait and buy cheaper.
@_date: 2011-06-11 22:33:13
He's a troll. Read his comment history.
@_date: 2011-06-19 08:32:19


This will work when most of your costs are paid in bitcoins, and when your suppliers' prices are stable.
@_date: 2011-05-29 06:11:20
That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the response.

Reddiquette. Read it. You don't have to agree with someone to upvote them.
@_date: 2011-07-06 12:09:46


It will stabalize eventually. When that happens, people will buy bitcoins because *they want to spend money online*. Other people will sell goods and services for bitcoins, and pay their costs in bitcoins too. Then it doesn't matter what their expectation for the future of the currency will be. They will be using Bitcoin because it is *useful*.
@_date: 2011-05-01 08:58:32
Sure, you can get your BTC to market fast, but the question was, *who do you think is going to ***buy*** it*?
@_date: 2011-04-21 06:13:10
Even if it's not.
@_date: 2011-06-06 19:03:22
It'll happen if someone finds a deficiency in Bitcoin and then creates a new system that fixes it. And if that happens all bitcoins will quickly become worthless.
But without a competitive edge, the momentum will give Bitcoin the monopoly.
Just like when people try to fork Wikipedia.
@_date: 2011-06-06 19:11:48
Hmm, I don't know how to read that. Can you tell me to what extend people are gambling on the price falling?
@_date: 2011-07-20 21:53:00
How are you hosting it? What's your app written in?
@_date: 2011-06-30 09:14:43


You're saying that some medium-sized hedge-fund could singlehandedly take control of the total network right now.
Do you realise that's what you're saying?
@_date: 2011-07-13 12:31:47
But can the relative computing power of each pool actually be quantified? Or the network as a whole?
@_date: 2011-07-21 08:03:41
Do you host it yourself? Do you some kind of service-level (availability) agreement with your ISP?
@_date: 2011-06-24 23:04:27
Why would you need to?
@_date: 2011-06-10 21:37:41
Having lots of bitcoin doesn't give you control.
It gives you the *potential* to *influence* the *price* of bitcoins only.
I agree that if someone dumped 100,000 bitcoin onto the market, the price would plumet. And probably stay low, because the supply of bitcoin just increased.
See, when someone takes 100,000 out of the market, by decreasing supply, that's essentially creating deflation. It's just like the destruction of those bitcoins. Unless they later sell them, when the price will correct back to where it would have been if they hadn't bought them.
@_date: 2011-04-25 03:01:34
I still don't see what advantage bitcoin poker has over US$ poker. You still have to deposit money onto the site to play. You still have to trust the site. The government can still seize the site's domain. Insider cheating is still possible.
Heck, if the site crashes, all the BTC being held by the site could be permanently lost.
Does anyone know if it's possible yet to get insurance for your bitcoins? That is, insurance against accidental loss/destruction?
@_date: 2011-05-29 05:51:08
Who would know they need bitcoins at a set date (in the future)?
@_date: 2011-06-30 12:49:54
Good on you. It's nice to see someone else basing their analysis on even back-of-the-envelope calculations about the future, instead of just where we are now and where we've been in terms of network capacity, price, economy, etc.
@_date: 2011-09-07 22:50:30
*They have always been producing 50 BTC per 10 minutes.*
@_date: 2011-05-08 04:38:45
When do you expect that to happen? Don't worry about being accurate, what's your best guess? Or if you can't guess, what's the earliest you think this might happen? Be pessimistic if you like.
@_date: 2011-06-22 12:36:03


No they're not handling the aftermath honestly and openly.
@_date: 2011-06-06 17:49:52
I think the fear will come back in a flood when Bitcoin options hit the market.
Right now, anyone who has good reason to believe Bitcoin will fail has no way to use that information; That information is not present in the market. Once people can pay for options to sell in the future, we will see that there are people out there who are willing to gamble that Bitcoin is doomed to fail.
@_date: 2011-07-10 11:42:06
Yes, you could say "I can pay you in USD, but I'll have to exchange some BTC, so it will cost you 0.65% of your fee."
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:56:23
I like this idea. You could do the same for cash withdrawals.
@_date: 2011-05-07 13:11:21
I understand that coins will never run out, they'll just get rarer and rarer. But if the price of computing power goes down over time (as expected), or if the value of bitcoins goes up over time (as expected), that will compensate for the extra time taken to mine coin.
@_date: 2011-06-18 04:47:18
There's no way this was a brute force attack over the web.
@_date: 2011-06-06 18:55:50
No, people will use them, for the black market. I want to pay someone $1000 online today, I buy $1000 worth of bitcoins today, and use them today, and I get my stuff. I don't care whether the price goes up or down tomorrow. I paid $1000 for $1000 worth of stuff.
@_date: 2011-06-08 09:56:05


Uh, that's what causes a bubble:
* No one is willing to sell because the price is going up;
* people keep buying;
* every time someone buys, the price goes up;
* eventually it stops;
* everyone finally realises the price was only so high because no one was willing to sell;
* people start selling, to take profit before the price falls;
* people realise there's a correction happening, and everyone tries to sell;
* no one is willing to buy, because the price is going down;
* every time someone sells, the price goes down;
* eventually it stops.
See the thing is, everyone knows Bitcoin is overvalued right now, but no one is willing to sell because the price is still going up!
@_date: 2011-06-18 11:56:16
How the hell would you know. Do they keep referrer logs, even though they don't check them when performing requests?
@_date: 2011-06-19 07:22:18

Where are all those bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-06-19 11:31:49


I'm really not. I mean, my comment just wasn't phrased that way.
Anyway... could you explain how you think that the dark pools being predominately used for selling is causing the price to be higher?
@_date: 2011-06-07 08:34:26
There's a problem though. Normally, options are actually *contracts*. But how do you enforce your bitcoin option against an anonymous user?
Answer: you have to rely on that site.
Question: what happens if it shuts down? What happens if you want a 10-year option? How much confidence can you have that you can enforce it 10 years from now?
@_date: 2011-06-19 09:53:32


No it's not. Read the article.
It might be the case that large sell orders in the dark pool are keeping the price higher than it otherwise would be, but it shouldn't be long before all those large-volumes are sold, and then people are as likely to be buying big in the dark pool as selling big.
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:32:08
No, it really wouldn't. Google has *Google*.

Have one, then switch to the other when the .com is seized. If the software is a download, it can use the IP address, and continue to work without the domain name.

To do bitcoin transactions, you use the bitcoin client, or an online wallet application. Bitcoin *is* money, remember?

What's the practical upper limit on difficulty? I.e. in the current network / software?
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:33:27
Not at all. Transaction fees are built into the protocol. And no escrow or insurance is built in, and someone has to pay for that, somehow.
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:14:51
Thanks. But what I meant was: is there a point at which the protocols or the current client implementation can't handle the sheer size of the difficulty because the number is to big? Sorry for not being clear before.
