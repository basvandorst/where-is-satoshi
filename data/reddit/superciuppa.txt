Been following since it was at 3000, kept telling myself to not invest because it was going to be a massive bubble and it would crash anytime soon, now that I know I could have quadruple anything I would have thrown at it in a couple of months I’m eating my balls...

I mean, do you honestly believe that alcohol is more dangerous than heroin? I think it has something to do with the rate of hospitalization and overall impact on society than actual danger that it poses to your health. I personally wouldn’t shoot some heroin after a long work day instead of cracking a beer open on the couch...

I don’t think banning alcohol is going to happen in the future, the production of alcoholic beverages is one of the economic and cultural pillars of certain countries, wine in Italy and France, whisky in England and beer in Germany and the Netherlands. Plus it’s not like everybody who drinks alcohol does it because he wants to get shitfaced, in Europe especially most people who drink alcohol do it during mealtimes, and then stop at that so they don’t get drunk on a regular basis...

Yeah that’s my point, alcohol is dangerous because it’s so widespread, not because it’s necessarily the more harmful drug on its own. If there would be as many heroin users as there are alcohol drinkers (and I don’t mean the serious addicts or alcoholics, just regular consumers of it), society would grind to a halt...
