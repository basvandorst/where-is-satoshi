Haven't been invested much time, but from a bigger picture cryptos will definitely be something that average people will use. Since they haven't yet it's hard to tell what coins will be worth what. But something is happening, almost as if attention is being set to them. It's a good time to start "looking to invest". 
The more and more places start accepting, the more they will catch on with average people. Once it hits the main blood flow of everyday spending they will be worth their true value.
As of now, something is happening with bitcoin itself. Completely speculative.. I think it's going down one last time before it pops again. Then it's going to make a big jump up again. Timing it right is impossible but from ME and just ME it's affected by attention. So since attention is being set right now people will pull in and pull out soon. It will drop. Then the HODL people will buy it back up to higher than average. Then newbies will bump it up to that last jump. 
Amazon will start accepting, once that happens all markets want to cover their bases to keep up with competition. 
This is completely my two cents and you should never base you investment decision off other opinions.

It's would be amazing to see a government accept cryptos. Used side by side with local currency. Even if a small country was the first, it could be pushed into others. 
I share the thought of the big drop, but it's hard to see by how much and when. The traders and newbies will make it drop. It will show what percentage of holders are doing. For it to be that 15-20% of holders touch 3 million is far fetched. Also what could make the snowball start rolling? A ban? Mainstream media? A "taco place" that sells double meat chalupas?
I'm think the people that got in first and the holders plus the transaction fees make up 40-60% of bitcoins right now. I pulled these numbers completely out of my ass so it's not a to scale model. We would have to look at when people bought and how much to see who's holding majority when it used to be less expensive. If businesses  are trading and where. Permanent holders because people lost keys
