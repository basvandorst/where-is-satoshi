Inflation in the bitcoin money supply is meaningful until 2040. It's 2040 to 2140 that's not going to be meaningful, when fees should replace block rewards.
Bitcoin money supply inflation still exceeds some fiat currencies. This will change after the 2020 halving.

This is more of a trust issue than a bitcoin issue. Bitcoin can accommodate any combination of signatories but in some ways it is better to trust one benevolent dictator.
Giving the control of money to a group always leaves them fighting like cats in a bag.
In 50 years many of the signatories will be dead. Nobody will understand 50-year-old technology assuming the keys haven't been mislaid during 50 years of house moving.
I suggest multi-part paper wallets. That way each person can make several redundant copies but can hide them where the other holders can't find them until it is generally agreed they should be combined.
Just make sure the minimum needed to release the funds is at least equal to the minimum number needed to distribute the funds as intended.

You are doing the wrong thing. It's not like metal detecting, it's like walking down a row of cars trying the handles to find one that's unlocked and has a wallet inside.
It's called theft by finding. And you didn't just find it, you went looking, so you need to examine your motives. You're not looking so you can give it all back, you're looking because you wanted to get some.
At least you had the innate morality to step back from the brink of disaster. Assuming you couldn't be traced, you would have to live the rest of your life knowing you're a thief and wondering what happened to the person whose life savings you stole.
As you can see, you're attracting the attention of other thieves, who want to know your MO, who think that thieving is 'work' because some effort is involved. I put the black spot on all of you.

I think you know more than you let on, but I'll play along for anyone else who's reading this.
Inflation is used by the public to refer to an increase in prices, when their fiat currency becomes worth less. It's a government stealth tax caused by inflating the money supply and spending the proceeds on war and running large budget deficits.
Because bitcoin's money supply is fixed and predictable, as demand rises then the purchasing power of the currency increases causing deflation (decrease) in the price of goods and services.
Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, meaning there is never a shortage of money however it does mean we will have to get used to our currency buying more rather than less each year as the government can't run the printing presses to 'stabilise' the exchange rates and rob your Mum blind in the process.

We knew straight away that the Web would allow anyone to be their own newspaper, radio station and store but the software to make these properly easy took decades to write and guess what? Most people don't want to be a newspaper, radio station or store (unless you count Facebook and eBay).
Bitcoin *will* allow everyone to become their own bank but not this week/month and most people will frustratingly still want to use a third party to manage their money.

Tl;dr Tether is probably the most successful alt-coin so far, that has a unique use case and that is 'mined' as required to stabilise the price.
Imagine a situation where you own an exchange, and the users want to keep dollar balances to trade with, but you can't use dollars or anything that's a direct competitor to the dollar, so you invent a coin that you can use instead.
There's a demand for these coins from people who want to diversify their portfolio, hold a dollar-dominated asset when cryptos fall and buy quickly before they rise. You sell your coin and get crypto in return. It's just another coin like any other alt-coin.
*Its aggregated value is equal to the demand for dollar-denominated holdings on exchanges*
Congratulations, you have invented an alt-coin with a killer app. - exchange reserve proxy for a dollar. As demand for dollar reserves goes up (as the market expands or when crypto tanks) you print more to keep the value constant. If the value falls (people sell to buy crypto or FUD) you use some of the crypto to buy back (effectively destroying them) but this doesn't happen much, if at all.
Tether is backed by a real-world use-case. Most alt-coins don't even have that, so it's not going to collapse because it's not backed by dollars, IF it's going to collapse it will be because most people think it needs to be backed by dollars when it needn't. Or if the US Treasury realises someone is muscling in on their scam.

Look, I don't understand why everyone's getting so confused around here. Litecoin is used to buy things, Litecoin isn't backed 1:1 with dollars.
USDT has a dollar as its *yardstick*, as its *metric*. It doesn't have to be redeemable for a dollar to be worth a dollar, it just needs a dollar's worth of utility.
In fact, the closer it is to an actual dollar, the more likely the US Mint and Treasury agents will turn up on the doorstep.
It's an altcoin that acts as a substitute for dollars on exchanges which can't get banking facilities and it's doing a pretty good job. It's probably the most successful altcoin to date.
If demand for dollar-denominated holdings goes up (crypto bear market), print more Tether and sell for crypto, propping up crypto market.
If demand for dollar-denominated holdings goes down (crypto bull market), sell some mooning crypto, buy back Tether and destroy it.
Tether will blow up when its issuers have problems pegging it to the dollar, for example if demand for dollar denominated holdings drops but that's not likely.
Tether is sticking it to the Man big time by allowing traders to do what the banks have decreed Should Not Be Done.
But you have to cash USDT out into crypto, not Treasury notes.

They probably don't have (or need) full reserves and certainly don't have full dollar reserves and they don't promise to redeem a Tether for a dollar.


I agree and I don't think they have 2 billion dollars tied up in reserve.


Some people might think its value is based on the assumption it can be redeemed for 1 USD but the market sets its value based on it having $1 of utility.




The bitcoin supply is fixed. If demand goes up, then bitcoin value has to increase. Tether's value is fixed. If demand goes up then more have to be created. That's the difference.

Nothing disappears apart from the value assigned to USDT, based on its utility.

No crypto is destroyed, it ends up in the hands of the Tether issuer in exchange for Tether. They can store it (risky) or sell it OTC for dollars in which case they are hedged.


Correct. If Tether price falls, exchange buys Tether with crypto. But as the aggregated demand for dollar-denominated exchange reserves is expanding with the total crypto 'market cap, it's a one-way winning bet.
Currently the only possibility is that they will 'overprint' it and have to scale back a bit, but the printing schedule appears to show that they think they have been timid and are now scaling up.


I don't trade so I don't quite understand this; but the arrival of real dollars and dollar pairs on exchanges would impede the sale of USDT at least in the US. The issuer would have to sell crypto or dollars to prop it up and may choose not to, leaving Tether to die.
USDT has many advantages over USD (lack of capital controls, tax-avoidance etc.) so it might not even have that much downside risk.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:48:13


They promise that USDT will stand in for the dollar on exchanges and so far that has been delivered.
The promise that it's fully-backed was necessary, but anybody that believed it must have just fallen off the top of a Christmas tree.


Demand is expanding. If demand contracts they would have to buy and destroy Tethers.


Or, alternatively, the markets are functional and Tether does stand in for dollars and the people who don't understand how it works are dysfunctional.

Gold makes nice jewellery and lousy money. It's just another commodity. The Romans would not have used gold as money if they had had bitcoin.
Gold bugs imply that gold is 'backed up' by the 'inherent' secondary use value, the truth is that gold's industrial value is much less than the spot price.

A blockchain is a global ledger, not a currency. It's native token may be a money and may additionally be a currency. Cryptos are backed by maths, the money supply is fixed and predictable. They are close to Nash's ideal money and valuable because they are useful and scarce.
Government-issued currency is issued constantly and unpredictably. It is only useful for paying taxes. Holders are robbed of purchasing power by large erratic increases in the money supply and an inflation target that robs them of 2 per cent of their wealth every year. Most governments are bankrupt and back up their currency with nothing. The mythical 'lender of last resort' is the 'money printer and bailer-out of failed banks' that was referred to in the very first block.
Blockchain tokens do not need a lender of last resort because they are a sovereign money, not debt-based.

Can we get one thing straight? BTC, BCH and the USD are ALL fiat currencies.
In the case of the USD, it's the government that decrees that it should be money and legal tender.
In the case of cryptos it's the code that makes that declaration. Just because you can trust the code to maintain the money supply more than the government doesn't mean cryptos aren't fiat.
Tone is corrupting the sense of 'fiat' to mean 'centrally directed' instead of 'centrally created'. His statement 'BCH is fiat' is equivalent to saying 'BCH is centrally directed'.
He has got the means of creation mixed up with his allegations over centralised control. Since the community uses 'fiat' as a perjorative, by attaching the term to BCH he claims he is exposing a dirty secret.
I hope he doesn't believe what he is saying, but I suspect he does, as his analysis is always pretty shallow and muddled.
I would have more respect for him if this was a deliberate hatchet job, since the headline 'BCH is fiat' is true (as also is BTC etc) but I suspect he just doesn't understand what 'fiat' means in the context of money.
The 'centralised control' argument was stupid in the light of the current three-way tussle over the direction of BCH. But neither side covered themselves with glory in this 'debate'.

The reason that people use government money is that it's convenient and they underestimate inflation tax. People use bitcoin for various reasons.

Historically gold has proved to be the best commodity for secondary use as exchange/money, due to its value/weight ratio, divisibility, corrosion resistance and constant demand for jewellery.
In 2018, however, gold is far from a perfect money. It has become too easy to counterfeit (with tungsten),   too easy to steal, expensive to store and transport, is not generally accepted in law for settlement of debt or taxes, cannot be transported across national borders, can be seized, cannot be sent by email etc.
Once it loses its goldbug premium, gold will be just another 'hard' commodity. In contrast, bitcoin is very close to Nash's ideal money and will spread quickly.

This is fun. First you say that 'realest' isn't a word outside of Scrabble, which it is, then you say Scrabble isn't governed by a dictionary, which it is, (technically it's a 250,000 word list), then you say that list isn't authoritative (hmm.., Scrabble the English word game's list of allowable English words...seems pretty authoritative to me). You're not on trial for your life here. Change your plea! You can't prove the word 'realest' doesn't exist; whereas anyone who Googles the Scrabble list of words based on the Collins Dictionary can find it straight away?

Agree. Just listened to his second appearance on Epicenter Bitcoins and Tim's superficially coherent but skewed understanding of the bitcoin model was machine-gunned out so fast that the interviewer was unable to rebut most of it so ended up agreeing. I don't know how someone can write so much without understanding the fundamentals. For example he includes costs that don't exist in the fiat economy (conversion) when calculating the cost of using bitcoin so he is not comparing like-for-like. This is hard to pick up on the fly and is a defective and unfair analysis. It's difficult to accept he's not aware of this.
@_date: 2018-09-23 04:33:26
Not only has he had no donations from the BTC community for responsibly disclosing a major BTC bug; I haven't heard any mainstream commentator acknowledge that it was a BCH developer wot found it.
The narrative is 'someone found a bug, in no time our wonderful developers fixed it'. This is a necessary variation on the 'our developers would never let a bug into our code' meme.

Your analysis seems to be based on the 'typical' load (which shows us at half-capacity) and not the 'max' load which shows that some blocks are starting to bump into the 1MB ceiling.

Wisdom of the Crowd doesn't work by voting for the expert opinion of your choice, it's good for counting beans in jars and estimating the weight of cows.

I say that WoC only works on simple problems by aggregating what are essentially uneducated 'guesses' to remove background noise but fortunately this problem is simple enough for WoC to work here. So what is the role of the technical expert in either scenario? To express an opinion, but certainly not to try to dictate the result. I get technical info from the devs and economic info from others. We do need someone to set a finishing line.
@_date: 2015-06-26 08:07:55
Absolutely. If you can sell a $5 note for $10 then you will keep doing that until the prices equalise, so the value of the token on the chain with the most utility will drag every other token up. This ratchet only works one way (who would sell a $10 note for $5?) All convertible tokens must end up with the same value as the most valuable token.

Your reply is internally inconsistent. You say 'realest' is not in a dictionary, yet you concede it's valid in Scrabble which is based on a dictionary. You say I won't find it in the WSJ and then immediately quote it from the WSJ. And then you let yourself down badly by writing 'want to use it' instead of 'wont to use it' which leads me to suspect you learned your English phonetically but didn't read much, so I 'won't' be taking English lessons from you.

Blockchain technology is a breakthrough in computer science that enables the public decentralised, trust-less and frictionless exchange of digital assets which are provably unique, underwritten by state-of-the-art cryptography and game theory. The first of these is bitcoin, the native token of the blockchain, adopted as a digital currency and asset that is inherently valuable because it is useful and scarce. Since most things can be represented digitally, blockchain technology is expected to be widely adopted. Cons: The system currently only supports 2-3 transactions per second but is due to be upgraded. Any currency with a fixed monetary base must fluctuate in value in response to changes in demand.

IMHO sidechains that are publicly tradable must drag the main chain (and all other tokens that can be traded for them) up to the higher value. Arbitrage dictates this. If a sidechain token is declared to have a value far in excess of its face value by a third party, then that third party will in effect be a registrar and could try to prevent arbitrage (for example by banning the assigning of rights) but at this point the system is no longer trustless and goes back to relying on a central database, police, lawyers etc There is a clear distinction between using chains to transfer value (because the tokens are varying degrees of useful and scarce) and using a chain merely as a ledger.

We'll have to disagree on this. Wisdom of the Crowd applies to quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning to remove idiosyncratic 'noise'.

Technical opinions are welcome but WoC can decide this because the issues are not too complex. We have come to the same conclusion for different reasons.

If you are saying that the mean of a great number of 'uneducated' estimates is more accurate than any single estimation, I agree. But this doesn't apply to matters that rely on an in-depth knowledge that most people are incapable of. There is a place for subject experts, the question is whether the block size decision requires deep technical knowledge of the sort that Peter has. Most people don't think so. Deciding that we ourselves can decide, is the most significant outcome of this debate.
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:58:59
Not this. I can't believe in this '1MB not broken; 2MB broken' mantra and I think the whole counter-argument to increasing the block size is driven entirely by an agenda of raising transaction fees. I like paying 0.1mBTC per transaction and I run a node for the privilege. Forcing up transaction fees is precisely how to turn Bitcoin into a bank.

The idea that people don't spend their wealth when it increases is wrong on its face.
Wages, pensions, investments, stocks, winning bets etc. are all examples of things that are exchanged for goods and services when the holder feels that the value of the goods exceeds the benefit of hodling.
If you never spend your wages (sudden increase in wealth every week) then you starve. If you don't spend your crypto then you get to buy a Lambo on your deathbed. Neither is compatible with a reasonable standard of living.
Nobody gets rid of their money to avoid inflation (outside of a few basket cases like Venezuela). That's why the inflation tax has been successful at keeping the middle class hard at work like rats on a treadmill for 100 years.

Agreed. Currently a third party 'owns' the shares and mediates the transfer of the beneficial interest. If you delegate that job to the blockchain it becomes the third party. Lawyers are still involved in disputes.
But if the value of the token is equal to the value of the asset - no lawyers (=trustless) because in the event of a default there is no loss. You get to keep the bitcoin and buy more shares.

The reason why not, is that if someone defaults on delivery of the asset denoted by the token, you are left with nothing. It's like swapping your Rolex watch for a piece of bubble gum.

You could use block chain technology and replace proof of work with trust. Centralization of trust would improve efficiency.

Anyone who uses blockchain technology by implication wants a decentralized trustless system which in turn implies use of the blockchain token-the bitcoin.

An online wallet where 2 out of 3 keys are required to move funds would be safest (you keep two, it has one). You use one key to co-sign their transactions and keep the other one in case they go bust. Also it must support two-factor authentication.

There's no hate for bitcoin as a settlement system. Bitcoin is inherently a settlement system because the value transfer simultaneously settles the debt. That's what makes it so attractive.
Most people are not phased by the 10 minute settlement time, either.
Turning it into a settlement system for the privileged few by artificially throttling it to impose a fee market is the problem.

I think you're right. For most people it's like asking if they'll accept Linden dollars or PLEX. You've probably got lots of it you don't want, right? The only time I would do this is if I could see a clear use case for the merchant, for example if they had to receive or pay money worldwide.
Getting paid in domestic currency is just not seen as a choke point by merchants. Accepting bitcoin isn't going to bring in much new business relative to the work involved and with respect, most shopkeepers aren't rocket scientists.
Spend your bitcoin at places which accept it and other merchants will adopt it when they see it has given early movers a commercial edge.

My reply 'and yet I didn't' was intended to provide tangible evidence that others with problems did exist, and a lesson that one's own perspective is perhaps not the best lens to judge the overall situation through.
You implied I had no evidence of my stuck transaction, which I proved. You neither asked for nor provided evidence of a working transaction from the other party.
You palliated your cognitive dissonance by bringing up an unrelated issue (criticising my wallet's choice of fee) without following your new argument through to its logical conclusion, which is that an unpredictable fee market makes bitcoin unusable in the short- to medium-term.

Yes or No. The sender would need $1m in Bitcoin for about 60 minutes (6 confirmations). I am pretty sure it could be done with trustless multisig escrow, or the old-fashioned way would be to use a third-party escrow (like localbitcoins) or take out a mutually trusted insurance against default. The point is that, yes, the blockchain is an immutable public ledger, yes, you can register pennies on it and tell everyone they represent peace on earth, but don't expect to buy my Rolex with anything less than the equivalent value of the only native token. I don't care if you say your colored coins are redeemable against some asset that may or may not exist and which may or may not be redeemable at the price we agreed, if at all.

The way I see it, a successful ETF is being priced in. Every day without a rejection is good news. So the price is climbing. You could say the chances don't vary so it's illogical for the price to increase and I'd agree with you.
Fact is we're all human and things get increasingly priced in the closer they are. If the ETF is rejected it will be priced out and we'll have a dive. The best time to sell would be just before the refusal, except nobody knows when that will be. Except some people will know, so if you see the price diving around 11-13 Mar you have a hard decision to make.
Hodlers won't care but market makers will want to sell and buy back lower. Some makers will jump the gun because they will bet the ETF will fail. They are just waiting for the price to top out and sell. They may start a downward move, that fools others into thinking they have inside knowledge that the ETF has failed.
So as we approach the deadline the market will get increasingly skittish with everyone daring everyone else to hodl and a big prize for whichever side calls it correctly.
Zoom out and look at the 1-year or 2-year chart and you'll see the ETF has only increased upside pressure. Bitcoin doesn't depend on it.

I think the analysis is all wrong. Coming off the gold standard was not a 'hard fork' that was effectively a theft because it was done 'without consensus'. It might have been theft and it might have been without consensus but it wasn't a hard fork because old dollars were still valid.
After the Great Train Robbery in the UK the British government literally changed the format of the notes to prevent the thieves spending their loot. That was a hard fork because all former notes were invalid, forcing hoarders to change their money at banks. It was done without consensus, it wasn't theft and it wasn't a problem (except for the thieves).

I think you are looking at it backwards. If scarcity is assumed, then price must be proportional to utility, since utility drives demand.
If gold is more valuable than silver, then it must have more utility, assuming both are equally scarce. You should be looking for the reasons people prefer gold to silver, not complaining everybody's got it wrong.
Both bitcoin and the dollar have no intrinsic value except as a money (fortunately). Bitcoin is a bearer-bond with its own intrinsic settlement system.
Fiat cash is a bearer bond; otherwise fiat is in the hands of third parties. You are forced to accept it in settlement of a debt but the only time you have to use it is when you pay your taxes.
I don't think the settlement system is what gives bitcoin its value, but it's a big part of what makes it useful as an ideal money.

Schiff comes at this from several different angles.
His biggest problem is that bitcoin is intangible. He also thinks the dollar is intangible, however he conveniently ignores the fact the dollar has value.
He says merchants don't accept or want bitcoin, they will always want fiat -- but then goes on to say they might want fiat now, but soon they will want shares in a Brinks gold repository.
He ignores the fact that bitcoin transactions are settled, while goldmoney transactions are not settled unless you take delivery of the gold, and involve third party risk.
Lastly he trots out old criticisms like 'anyone could invent bitcoin 2.0' and ignores first mover advantage and network effect.
Ultimately he makes money by charging 2 per cent to manage (badly) the wealth of people who are scared of a zombie apocalypse. That sort of fund can lose money for years and if a zombie apocalypse comes good luck finding him in Puerto Rico.
His clients are saying 'Why aren't we in bitcoin, Peter?' so he says enough to steer his clients (who are, remember by definition dumb because they can't manage their own affairs) back to the zombie apocalypse.
It's a shame because I think he's prescient on US affairs and the Fed. and a double shame because we're so busy fucking up bitcoin, nobody could use it even if he saw the light.

My guess, and it's only a guess, is that Satoshi's coins are in a time-locked trust and need to be realised in the most friendly jurisdiction (as soon as that becomes clear), so there's no point blundering into giving the authorities irrevocable proof of identity at the moment.

A 'store of value' does not mean that something has to be stored, it just means it retains its spending power.

He's wrong that money must have some intrinsic value (such as gold/jewelry). All money needs, is to fulfill the requirements for perfect money (liquidity, fungibility, immutability etc). Bitcoin is a perfect money.
He's wrong to ignore the network effects of bitcoin. Peter says coins can be created ad infinitum, each one could replace, or at the least, dilute bitcoin's monetary base. This is like saying 'Facebook is worth nothing. Anyone can clone Facebook'.
He's wrong to say gold is money. Yes, technically legally it's defined as money, but that is a historical hangover. Nobody uses gold as money any more. Because it's pretty useless as money these days. You can't take it across borders. Storing it involves third party risk. It requires a separate settlement system.
Peter is wrong to call bitcoin a Ponzi scheme. Peter knows what a Ponzi scheme is and it's this particularly, that leads me to suspect he is being less than honest in his criticism.

Proof of work (PoW) is described in Satoshi's White Paper which builds upon previous ideas to cut down on spam by making any attack extremely expensive for the attacker.
PoW is only Byzantine-tolerant, which means it relies on a majority of miners being honest, to work.
Every miner is given a checksum which embodies all transactions to date. They try and find a random number which combines with this, to produce a new acceptable checksum.
Any attacker would have to accumulate a substantial percentage of the hash rate to overtake the honest chain (and if he did, it would be in his interests to act honestly, since he would be getting rewarded in bitcoin).

Paul has done a good job in the past of explaining why currencies shouldn't be taxed. He usually does this in the context of gold as money.
In the UK, currency held by citizens for their own use is exempt from CGT (not so currency traders/businesses). Gold is exempt because the Treasury thinks it's money. Silver (coins) are VAT-able because the Treasury says it's not money.
The importance of this podcast is that Paul is shifting his viewpoint to include crypto with gold in the category 'sound money'. (Like Mike Maloney / unlike Peter Schiff).

The reason why it has never been explained like this is because retaining the 1MB limit was based on the argument that larger blocks would have an adverse effect on bandwidth, node count and decentralisation.
Therefore the fact that SegWit would produce and require larger blocks was not mentioned as it undermined the arguments in favour of 1MB limit. (In the early days a few people did point out that the witness data would have to travel over the network somehow in any case).
Now, suddenly, it appears that larger blocks are OK if done through SegWit, larger blocks they are and larger blocks we will have.
I appreciate this explanation but saying 'surely this is the increase big-blockers want?' is missing the point. It turns out that an increase in the 1MB limit is not so impossible after all and some movement on both issues was expected and promised.
It seems as if proponents of SegWit just want their big block idea to be moved to the front of the queue. A modest parallel increase in the block size limit from 1 to 2MB would have made this all go away. This would have the effect of reducing competition in supply (user fees go down), while increasing adoption (miners' fee income goes up).
What is being proposed is the worst of both worlds (a bigger fee auction).

Well one of us is going mad and I would like to find out which it is. =)
The best definition I could find is this:
"...as a side effect, (SegWit) introduces an accounting trick that raises the effective block size (by not counting part of the data against it)."
Also this:
"When upgraded nodes send block data to old nodes they will strip out the signature data from transactions making them smaller. These old nodes can still only take 1mb of data for a block, and the only way to make them get all the transactions is to strip some of the data from them. So it is definitely making transactions smaller for those old nodes.
"When new nodes send the block data to other new nodes it sends the full transaction with the signature data. So they see a larger than 1mb block and transactions aren't any smaller (possibly larger)."
They get a 1MB block, plus the witness data so they 'see' a larger than 1MB block. It's a good technical workaround but not a solution that satisfies people who actually want larger blocks rather than 'effectively larger blocks' or 'accounting tricks' or a one-off increase in 'capacity'.
If I'm wrong I'm happy to admit it and sorry if you felt I was calling you arrogant.

I am currently in Delhi, there is no sign of bitcoin here. There is very little cash and even using Visa or MasterCard is difficult once you get out the tourist hotels.
Small businesses charge 3.5% on top for Visa and need a day's notice, plus your name, card type, permanent address in India and passport scan before their merchant services provider will send you an email link to their payment portal (which never arrives). Then if your details differ by one ASCII character your payment falls, your card gets frozen and you have to go to a bank with your passport to unfreeze it.
I would love to pay with bitcoin but they are all using Paytm app. This requires an Indian mobile number (prepaid Vodafone 3GB 4G SIM is 1000 rupees or about $16 at airport). To get one you need to give scan of passport plus they take your picture with camera, then you have to ring activation number to confirm your name, passport number and address in India and confirm you want Internet access. Then you get called every 30 minutes by all the people they've sold your number to.
Once you have got Paytm app and Indian mobile number, you can't top it up because you don't have Indian credit card.
Why has India gone for Paytm and not bitcoin? Look at Paytm app and compare it with bitcoin wallets. If we had a wallet that completely hid the crypto (showed only the fiat balance) made transfers immediately (not after 10-40 minutes) kept a static fiat balance (didn't keep going up and down) with no payment fees (and certainly not variable and unpredictable fees) that guaranteed payment (not just suck it and see) then bitcoin might take off in India. As it is-no chance.
And that's without going into the economics of living under a plastic tarp. and some scaffolding and having to sleep outdoors all night whether it's a thunderstorm or not. All this argument about fees per byte, you can't see the wood for the trees.

Just because the best money historically has always had some other use ('intrinsic value') does not mean it must be necessary. History only tells us what happened in the past.
Bitcoin is the first system that was purpose-designed as a pure money. Having no intrinsic value turns out to be a feature, not a bug.
And having no intrinsic value is not the same as having no value, whatever Schiff says.

The best money has no intrinsic value, otherwise there would be a conflict between its two use cases. It just has to be useful (possess the properties of an ideal money) and scarce.
Gold has an industrial use, which you could say makes it 'intrinsically' valuable, but it trades well above its value as a metal. The extra value comes from its suitability as a money (hint: good but not as good as bitcoin).
Mises was obsessed with the idea that all money was once a commodity, until bitcoin came along and bit his theory in the ass. Bitcoin's value is derived from its suitability as money, it doesn't need to electroplate anything as a sideline.

I think that's a bit harsh. Most people would accept that concerns over bandwidth were voiced in opposition.


Thank you for this reference. I don't remember opponents of a larger max. block size giving much publicity to the current ability of the network to absorb 4MB blocks.


I appreciate that SegWit is thought to be a good compromise between extra load and increased versatility. Personally I support it, but currently it is a hostage to fortune in a community that has been split by factionalism and the emergence of toxic brands.
How many people are 'opposed' to a hard fork won't stop one. The longer this factionalism persists, the more chance we will have a hostile hard fork. I don't think we need to be afraid of them. As they say, this is a feature, not a bug. Hard forking might be how the system turns from a chrysalis into a butterfly.


Bitcoin only becomes a fee auction if there is competition in supply. Miners were expected to live off seigniorage until about 2040. Transaction fees were intended to replace seigniorage when (despite a high bitcoin price), very few bitcoins could be mined.
A trivial fee (like we used to have) would discourage spam and encourage adoption. Cheering a fee market now leaves us stunted and throttled.

The price was agreed in fiat. Then bitcoin went through the roof, so the buyer had to pay a lot less bitcoin (hence 'bought house cheap'). The seller got the same amount of fiat, but from far fewer bitcoins.
If the seller had agreed to denominate the sale in bitcoins, instead of insisting they be converted to fiat at the current rate on the date of sale, then seller would be happy.
Moral is: denominate sales, loans in bitcoins; purchases, debt in fiat.

Of course they do. Why not? The fact that there are fewer bitcoins than ounces of gold is common knowledge. There is a time to compare aggregated value and there is a time to compare price of an arbitrary unit.
This is the unit price comparison time. Providing what constitutes a unit hasn't changed, comparing unit price is a good way to monitor relative value.
Trying to downplay a bitcoins' value exceeding an ounce of gold by pointing to aggregated value is misdirection. If anything the evidence points towards bitcoins' 'market cap.' eventually exceeding that of gold.

"I don't know how many times I've explained to people that Segwit is a block size increase, and in the very next thread they're complaining about how Bitcoin is dead because there's no block size increase in sight.."
...is difficult to maintain. SegWit may increase capacity but not block size. Therefore opposing it on the grounds that it doesn't increase block size is logical and tenable. SegWit is not the large blockers' solution of choice. Despite that, many large blockers support SegWit, providing max. block size is relaxed (which was promised).

The difference is that BCH has an emergency difficulty adjustment (downwards) which kicks in after 12 hours. BTC has to wait 2016 blocks (2 weeks but could be much longer).
Also, with a max. 8MB block, BCH can shift more data in one block/hour, than BTC can in six blocks/hour.
BCH will therefore survive periods of extreme shorter of hash power much better than BTC. Bring on the downvotes.

BTC is not a stock or a commodity. Its value depends on its utility and its scarcity. The jury is still out on on its utility (increasing with every new application, decreasing with every worry about government interference).
How useful is a global money that enables the transfer of value between any two people worldwide, within minutes, at little or no cost, immune from third-party interference or taxation, using only a mobile 'phone?
We don't know, because it's only just been invented. An aggregated value of a few trillion dollars at least, I would guess, probably much more. It's nowhere remotely near a bubble.

A small percentage change in bitcoins' value now produces a lot of bucks. It's time to say 'Ya boo sucks' to the people who said bitcoin was always going to be too volatile to work as a currency.

A coloured coin is a UTXO that has been agreed to represent a separate asset or obligation that must be enforced in law if the transfer is not honoured.
The coin must be large enough to be capable of transfer but unlike normal bitcoins, the transfer does not constitute the entire settlement.
A coloured coin, therefore, is nothing more than using the blockchain to record an event, with the exception that the same coloured coin can be recycled by agreement to represent the same event (eg transfer of ownership of an asset).

I agree that 'real' scaling will come on the upper tiers, but all your boogie men (Chinese firewall, node operators, governments, disk space, bandwidth, Mr Ver  and presumably Mike Hearn, Gavin etc) don't add up to a hill of beans.
You're driving the car at 1mph and you're petrified to go at 2mph in case the brakes fail, people mistake it for a bus, the wheels fall off or you come to a really, really sharp corner. I'm sitting in the back of this car and it's very frustrating because it's not going anywhere.
It's frustrating that there are no proponents of the current block limit, and everyone seems to agree that 2MB won't stress the system overly, yet everyone and their grandmother has got a boogie man telling them not to do the bleedin' obvious.
Any charge (even 1 cent) will discourage spam but you will never build a network that can't be spammed. And you shouldn't try to discriminate against valid transactions which might be tomorrow's perfectly legitimate killer app. But any fee higher than 1 cent excludes most of the world from using it.
This pressure for an increase will not go away. In fact it seems to be growing and a hostile hard fork is looking increasingly possible. Your off-chain scaling solutions might solve the scaling problem but they do not exist at present.
What a 1MB limit brings us currently is an unreliable system where you can't predict the fee required to get in any block, fees that exclude third world adoption and confirmation times that range from an average of 10 minutes to never.

He thinks the people who have been dumb enough to send him bitcoin are doing it to make the fake claim that he's a closet bitcoiner; or because of some misguided idea that by using it, he will become a convert.
He accepts bitcoin in payment, because he considers that helping hodlers turn BTC into gold through a payment processor, is a mission of mercy.

If bitcoin was (say) $1000 and somebody found a use case for a Counterparty token that cost 1BTC to buy, that increased the token's value to $2000, then 1BTC would be worth $2000.
The US Dollar's convertibility into gold from 1959 to 1971 led to President Nixon breaking the link. 
In September 1992, the British government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism after it was unable to keep it above its agreed lower limit.
So long as any asset is 'pegged' to bitcoin at a fixed exchange rate, the value of both/either is the higher of the two unless the link is broken. Arbitrage will ensure this.
This is why BTC owners don't lose value during a hard fork, because their money is guaranteed on both chains. (Yes, other, different, arguments might apply regarding total aggregate value).
The extent to which XCP Counterparty or any Counterparty-created assets or any other asset is guaranteed denominated and fixed in BTC, is the question.

Consultations are a form of intellectual laziness dressed up as pluralism. The SEC is looking to defend its decision claiming it has consulted widely. The implication is that their decision is based on consensus.
What they are looking for is:
* new arguments for or against that they have completely missed (very rare)
* new angles on existing arguments that significantly strengthen or weaken them
* an idea of the 'mood' of the public
The decision is then made by looking at the balance of the arguments. Public submissions are very unlikely to sway the result but the applicant may be asked to clarify issues raised by the public. This insulates the SEC from public criticism of its decision later.
Jorge Stolfi asserting that bitcoin is a Ponzi is unlikely to come as news to the SEC and his failure to justify it either here or there means it will be ignored. He is however getting technically more competent at bamboozling non-bitcoiners.
We just have to trust the SEC to understand the market.

You see, this is my point.
There is no real intention to lift the block limit, just a bunch of disingenuous devs with an apparent conflict of interest, peddling 2nd and 3rd tier vaporware.
Nobody wants to use corporate or proprietary tiers on top of the main chain and we're intelligent enough to know we don't have to, at least for the time being.
SegWit is a good idea but wrapped up in it is the key to corporatism and commercialism and I want to leave that door locked for the time being.
I have a record of every cup of coffee ever bought with bitcoin in a 100MB corner of my 7TB RAID 5 array on my Windows 10 home PC. It amounts to one small cat picture every 10 minutes. Most people rent 100MB cloud storage off Google without blinking just for personal use.
Raising the block limit is a no-brainer. The coffee argument is really a proxy for how the network scales. At this level, it scales fine linearly.
If you can demonstrate that your second tier would be open source, free and non-proprietary and high volume with low or no fees then most of the opposition to SegWit would fall away.

It is implied that he meant 'fewer people than would do otherwise (assuming no fee market and therefore lower fees)'.

This. The whole 'Satoshi had feet of clay' thing is deliberately overdone. Apparently by 'following your dream' and working hard enough, now anyone can be X-Factor Satoshi.
Einstein was a bored clerk in a Patents Office. His job was to spend all day imagining how obscure novel things should work from drawings and descriptions and to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of what existed.
From this and pursuing physics as a hobby, he made his conceptual leap (that it was the speed of light that was constant, and not time). This was not open to physical testing and was purely a series of 'brain experiments'. 
This points towards Satoshi being immersed in crypto theory, reading every new paper, lurking in all the important groups before making the conceptual leap that lead to a public blockchain and all that follows from that.
I would look for someone with some maturity at the time (25 - 40), with a high IQ (but not necessarily an academic), possibly current or past member of Mensa and a large dollop of Asperger's. He will probably have posted online but mainly questions asking for further clarification of ideas. Probably a high achiever in other areas with a high-paying job that meant he could indulge his obsession and happy family etc.
I bet his wife knows who he is/was. He will have been the first person in history to bore her with 'bitcoin news' as soon as she woke up. 8&lt;)
In both case they were visionaries. There was a point where they had a conceptual breakthrough and they joined the dots in a way that was not obvious to workers in the field.
It is easy to minimise this with hindsight. Books exist to explain the General and Special Theories to the common man and Satoshi's White Paper is very accessible, but seeing something like this in advance is not just a matter of 'hard work', it's impossible unless you are a seer.
The hard work comes post-facto but if you have the framework in your head, the job defines itself. It's just a case of assembling the parts.

I understand perfectly and your argument doesn't lead where you think.
The Tragedy of the Common refers to competition over a finite resource ('the Common'), which is in the public domain. To avoid depletion of the resource, the solution is to set up a central authority which can ration access.
Word processors don't restrict word counts and you don't have a daily email limit. Block space is artificially scarce, so Tragedy of the Common does not apply.
Miners get seigniorage to run the system. We all pay the miners by accepting their inflation of the money supply.
Supposing we doubled the limit, bitcoin doubled in price and users and nobody died? The only arguments against are i) people would immediately want 4/8/16 MB etc which eventually would be too large or ii) hard forks are best avoided.
You couldn't stop people asking for 4MB blocks but the arguments for and against would be more finely balanced. As for hard forks in my desk, I've got 5 1/4" disks, 3 1/2" disks, cassette tapes, mini discs and the odd camera that takes chemical film.

In an altruistic system cost is not a factor (within reason).
It's possible for the cost to go up, yet still have more nodes if the number of nodes is more closely related to the number of altruistic users and only loosely related to the cost.
Also, most of the costs of a node are already 'sunk' (line already paid for, hard disk space spare anyway) so cost is not a factor.
Lastly, we have far more nodes than is necessary to secure the system so a possible drop in node count is not a reason to stall on block size.

Gold is a relic. It's just a metal. An attractive metal, I'll give you that, but there are other metals to invest in.
For centuries gold was the bitcoin of the ages. It was universally traded, easily recognised and always useful and scarce enough (although its commercial value is much less than its price and consists mainly of the work put into a piece of jewellery, for example).
Just because something was valuable in 1453 or for the last 5000 years doesn't mean it's valuable now. Pirates and Moguls didn't have the internet. Sultans didn't have to contend with a paper market 'creating' as much gold as it could sell. People don't realise that gold can be counterfeited.

The record of which bitcoin are associated with which private keys, is stored on the blockchain. Your private key is stored on the Trezor.
Once you log in the Trezor it will sign transactions with your private key. This enables you to move bitcoins, authenticate to Web sites etc.
The Trezor must be connected to sign anything, whether it's via USB to a PC running Electrum or via an OTG cable to a smartphone running Mycelium.

The value of something is determined by supply and demand. Scarce = reduced supply.


Fewer miners does not increase confirmation times.


Bitcoin is what FX desks call an 'exotic' (a small cap. currency). It is expected to be volatile until it grows larger.
Transaction fees are generally very low. You can choose your own confirmation time (from the instant the transaction is broadcast to a few hours if you are paranoid about a fork).
If big companies are staying away from bitcoin it's because (like you) they don't understand it or there are regulatory obstacles.
It has several other advantages over existing settlement systems (trustless, decentralised, immutable).

When you transfer bitcoin you are transferring money. You are not transferring 'nothing'. How much energy does it take to transfer a ton of gold from A to B? With bitcoin this can be done in an email.
The energy that goes into minting bitcoin is also a one-off cost. You can think of the transactions in each block as free.
The energy requirements are greatly exaggerated by established interests. Bitcoin disintermediates banks. How much power does it take to run Wall Street or the City of London? Do we worry? Do we campaign against Christmas lights each year?

Two interchangeable assets will always be as valuable as the most valuable of the pair, because if their values diverged you could buy the cheaper of the two, convert it to the other one and then sell it for a profit. Valuable sidechains will 'drag' bitcoin's price up.
Any coin that is in theory infinitely divisible is not scarce. It doesn't matter whether your currency has 21 million coins, 42 or 1. What matters to value is how useful it is and how scarce it is at that point in time, taking into account money supply and velocity.

Bitcoin is a currency/asset. It competes with other currencies and assets. It doesn't exist in a bubble (except in this forum). People who are interested in bitcoin are interested in information about competing currencies and assets providing they are important and relevant. A state devaluing its currency by 5 per cent in three days is relevant. Inflation, deflation and the money supply of currencies are all relevant to bitcoin and are often discussed here.
Moderators often make the mistake of thinking it's their job to restrict content to what they want to see, rather than simply remove what the community doesn't want to see. Ruthlessly pruning non-bitcoin content in the hope that the bitcoin core opinion formers will be attracted here ignores the fact that (outside of an occasional thread) the technical debate happens elsewhere. The subreddit has a much wider audience and it should reflect their wider interests.

The UK government has no need to 'ban' encryption. It can already demand that anything be decrypted, there is no constitutional right to keep your thoughts private in the UK, including your passwords. Plus we already host GCHQ which does an excellent job of listening to world traffic and sharing it with certain three-letter agencies that can't overtly spy on their own population because of 4th amendment issues. We photograph every driver on every trip and put every voice call through voice pattern analysis so don't bother using a 'burner' in the UK.
The government has powers to intercept or request data and instruct the provider to keep this interception from the media and the target. Cameron's statement was designed to justify and preserve, post-Snowden, what they are already doing-which includes keylogging Windows 10 and listening in on Skype and getting lists of the files you open with LightRoom and Premiere Pro for all we know. End-to-end encryption with perfect forward secrecy and open-source software are the answers.

Yes, potatoes can be eaten, used as a battery for ants and made into vodka (and printing press etc). The blockchain/bitcoin has hundreds of use cases. That's why, if you ask nicely, someone will give you a potato for nothing, but a bitcoin costs several hundred dollars.
The blockchain and its native token bitcoin have wide application. If you are saying use as money is a 'niche' application then I'd have to say that's a pretty big niche and that's just one application.

It's all relative. You can compare currencies to each other but there's no currency to 'measure' against because they are all manipulated at various times. Gold used to be the standard for measurement (because it was impossible to create it at will) and by that measure, all currencies lose value, but even the price of gold is manipulated now by selling certificates for gold that doesn't exist.
Bitcoin is the first currency that can't be created at will that has a fixed and predictable money supply but currently increasing in excess of 9 per cent, twice that of the dollar. It is likely that the dollar/bitcoin exchange rate will move in favor of bitcoin in the medium/long term (post 2016).
You are right that the price of a bitcoin comes as a surprise to most people and may be a psychological deterrent to investing but the reality is that, unlike shares, you can move even small amounts into bitcoin cheaply and the percentage subsequently gained or lost would be the same.

There's a lot of misunderstanding regarding the size of the bitcoin money supply. With fiat a constant level of price inflation is targeted, with the twin objectives of i) smoothing out volatility due to variation in demand to maintain public confidence and ii) to misappropriate the proceeds of seigniorage.
The number of bitcoins is fixed, which means that the value of a bitcoin must vary with demand/supply. Currently supply is increasing at around 9 per cent annually which is high, even for fiat. This is because we are still in the 'distribution' phase (come and get it while it's cheap). This phase will end (in my opinion) when the bitcoin supply is increasing more slowly than governments are printing fiat (about 5 per cent in the US) - so probably this time next year.
There is no mechanism to prevent volatility. You could argue that an inherently volatile currency would be unpopular but supporters say this is a feature, not a bug and that volatility will be mainly upwards and will reduce greatly with widespread adoption.
The conundrum is that the bitcoin money supply can be increased although the number of bitcoins is fixed, by dividing each bitcoin into smaller units. This is because each part of a bitcoin acts like the whole. This means that (unlike fiat) the benefits of expanding the money supply accrue to the existing holders and not to a third party.
If gold went up in value, for example, it could be traded in grammes or atoms (good for gold owners) but as this is impractical to do physically, gold is leveraged over 100 times by people who print paper certificates because there is no Merkle tree mechanism to check your claim to physical gold.
With bitcoin if there is a 'stock split' in a few years, at least we can guarantee that nobody will get cheated by being sold part of a bitcoin that belongs to 100 other people.

Your initial premise (that the miners are entitled to some sort of guarantee) is faulty. You have also assumed that larger block sizes would automatically lead to centralization and then to cap it off you've broken one of the tenets of bitcoin, which is the fixed money supply.
I didn't tell the miners to spend millions on ASICs that are worthless as soon as they're out of the box and I don't see why I should have to put up with a congested system, high fees and an extension to their seigniorage to keep them in business. I'm running a node on a domestic line no problem and if the difficulty comes down enough (it won't) I'll start mining on my 560Ti so don't worry about centralization.
There's going to be a concerted attempt at FUD between now and the halving orchestrated by the miners. They know the score and they've been through it before. They just happen to have millions at stake this time so I don't blame them for trying. Let's get the block size increased and we'll see it was all a fuss over nothing.

Access to the Web to run a node is different to access to cheap transactions. There is no reason as a group we can't have both. Everyone can have cheap transactions, even if some people can't run nodes. You don't need to run a node to use the system and the number of nodes is related to security, not to the cost per transaction.
My node is running OK on a connection that manages about 3Mbps up on a good day. It uploads about 8GB a day. It has about 50 connections and doesn't cost me anything I don't pay already. There will be enough nodes.
Miners on the other hand are rent-seekers with one aim - maximise profit. Unlike governments, miners' seigniorage income must fall. With a halving coming up and depressed prices, they are going to want a bail-out through higher transaction fees.
If we are going to remain honest, we have to let price discovery work in mining, even if that means a lower difficulty and some bankruptcies. Fortunately the network is currently oversecured.

Before this subreddit turns into an offshoot of ZeroHedge can I point out the implications of this alarmist thought experiment relevant to bitcoin? Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply. Since you can create a trillion dollars of 'derivatives' from a $10 note I fully expect the bitcoin 'derivatives' market to be larger than the bitcoin supply. The problem with fiat derivatives is that they have lately been predicated on asymmetrical information (the seller knows the derivative is worthless, the buyer doesn't) and this tangled ball of wool is so huge nobody knows where the end is to unravel it. Merkel trees mean that bitcoin derivatives can be traced back to the Bitcoins underwriting them.
Bitcoins are like Swiss bank accounts. To seize them you have to link the number/address to a person and there's no risk of a Swiss bank employee going rogue as recently occurred. Bitcoins are also Bearer Bonds which the US government banned because they can't regulate them. For all of the above reasons, diversifying into bitcoin would seem to be a good idea, while you can.

Market theory requires that assets are fairly priced. A bubble has occurred when an asset is overpriced and suddenly drops. Bubbles may occur because of irrational exuberance. Investors hate bubbles because investing in one can kill your portfolio.
Bitcoin is not in a bubble. Investors are exuberant, hence steep price rise, but not irrational. It is a new asset class and it's in the process of price discovery. Nobody can agree on how to value it but all agree that, so far, it's only realised a fraction of its utility and that there is considerable upside to the price based on its baked-in scarcity.
Saying 'it's a bubble, it's going to pop, but in the meantime it may go higher' just allows naysayers like Schiff to reconcile the inconsistencies in their world view.

Currencies other than the local fiat satisfy a need, in the case of holiday money it is to spend in a different market (cf Silk Road). Other first tier needs not served by fiat (like them or not) might be to conserve wealth where the fiat is crumbling, bypass capital transfer laws or evade income tax, send money without alerting/paying a third party, create Bearer Bonds, hide wealth. These are covert applications. It's somebody else's job to worry about those.
Second tier (overt) USPs might be to avoid chronic fiat inflation, send money by email, as a secure savings account, to get a discount, as a speculative investment, as a time-stamped ledger, to settle small interpersonal debts, to eliminate identity theft, to send to dependants abroad, to avoid chargebacks, trade 24/7 and to spend while abroad with no commission. This list is far from exhaustive.
Last of all will be a third tier of general conversion from fiat, to participate in the new global bitcoin economy.
If the person you are talking to has none of the needs listed above, they will be in the last tier of adoption.

You make it sound like the money supply is going to double. It's not. All the software will be pre-upgraded and ready to switch to larger blocks seamlessly. Larger Blockheads will carry on business as normal. Smaller Blockheads might try to keep smaller blocks going for a few hours or days using old software, mainly in the hope of defrauding suppliers into parting with good or services, for coins initially mined into small blocks. Exchanges and payment processors are not likely to get caught up in this idiocy. It's like the Year 2000 date rollover hysteria all over again. Jackals are looking at this fork as an opportunity for fraud, speculation, arbitrage and shorting. It won't be.

'Ledger agnostic' is Byrne's way of saying 'We're using blockchain technology, but not the PoW public blockchain'. The financial sector has already decided it's going to use Proof of Trust private blockchains for settlement. Going to the Courts for restitution if the goods aren't delivered is a model they are comfortable with and the chances of non-delivery are small. The Web site does refer to 'the blockchain' but I think that's because it reads better than 'a (random) blockchain'. Also it says 'affecting nearly instantaneous settlement' which is poor.
We all know that PB is on a crusade to overturn the tables of the financial establishment and good luck to him, but we may have to accept that the public blockchain will be most useful to people who have little or no recourse to the Courts as the value is inherent in the transfer. Selling businesses a trendy database and calling it a blockchain might be a stepping stone, or it might not.

I don't think people say it's 'backed by math', I've seen people write that it is already 'regulated by math' in the debate over regulation. Bitcoin is valuable because it is useful and scarce. This is in direct contradiction to the Austrian School which says that use as money must be a secondary function of a good, that already has some other value. Frankly I think they are going to have to get over that.
Of course people have to believe that bitcoin is useful and scarce, but the value emanates from its properties, not the belief. It's just easier to attack the belief than it is the math.

Your input addresses will always be linked to the chain of inputs/outputs that produced them unless you move them out of bitcoin and back in again using an exchange like Shapeshift.io. The longer the chain the more difficult it is to prove that they are linked transactions, but they will always be linked. Plus your coins might get linked in a mixer to some Cryptolocker coins and some Gox coins.

Wrong that the expansion of the Web manifested as a huge explosion of pent-up demand for something that people didn't even understand. Also wrong, in that domestic computer-to-computer communication was possible from the mid-80s over dial-up modems using bulletin board systems which acted as central message servers with little or no interest from mainstream users. Also many early users ended up with many email addresses as they changed ISPs without being accused of 'making them up' to speed adoption. It's far too soon to say if or when bitcoin will go mainstream but it feels to have the same utility in relation to finance as the Web did to information exchange.

A hard fork is unstable (=good). The preferred chain will quickly replace the deprecated chain, particularly when you realize that it won't get triggered until it has a 75 per cent adoption head start. This will happen within a few blocks (an hour or so). After the fork, all transactions on the losing chain will be undone/rolled back. Nobody will lose any coins. The only people who might theoretically lose out are merchants with antiquated wallets who ship physical goods in return for doomed bitcoins on the losing chain in the first few minutes after the fork. They might lose the goods.
A post-fork bitcoin will still be worth a pre-fork bitcoin. I think that the fiat value of bitcoin would rise on news that the hard fork had passed (I think it will go without major incident despite all the hysteria and doom-mongering) and it now had more upside potential.

I think this has been done by offering to sell a valuable precious metal bar for some ridiculously small amount of fiat, on the street, just outside a metal exchange which could verify it. It failed because the public assumed the seller was in league with the exchange to verify fake bars. It supposedly portrayed the public (stupidly) preferring cash, but what it illustrated was the problem of verifying the authenticity of previous metal, without trusting a third party. If someone was selling $100 bitcoin paper wallets for $5 I don't think they would have trouble, as they are easier to authenticate, once people learn what they are.

Bitcoin BTC is a monetary good with considerable upside and downside risks. To benefit from extraordinary returns you have to take a big chance that you will lose your money. If that fits your risk profile then fine.
It has to be said that it's better to understand the utility and scarcity of bitcoin before exchanging your dollars, rather than 'buying it as an investment' because you've heard that might be a cool idea.
And if you're going to buy in, do it by dollar cost averaging to get best value. Lastly, the question of whether a large tranche of bitcoins is lost, or was simply frozen, may be resolved on or shortly after 1 Jan 2020 which may move the market.

Welcome to the bitcoin community. The rules of bitcoin are set out in the core client (until such time as a standards body is agreed). If you do not follow the rules, any coins you create will be rejected by the system.
If you attempt to change the rules, any change you make will be rejected by the stakeholders unless it benefits them all. And every stakeholder defines 'benefit' differently.

Bitcoin is capable of acting as both a commodity and/or a currency, depending on the context of its use. Arriving at a fair valuation is very difficult as the technology is still very new and a number of outcomes are possible however most people think there is more upside than downside.
The money supply is fixed as it would require agreement of all concerned to change it, which would obviously be against their best interests.

But what would be the point? The problem is that not enough people want it.
Instead of 95%, why not use 51% as per the original spec? Nobody gets 95% support for anything. Who, in their right mind, decided that 95% was achievable?
We need a selection of proposals that will activate at 51% supported by a healthy (and fair) futures market to steer the way. This can be arranged by proponents and markets and decided by users (miners to follow on).
It combines a meritocracy with free markets and the wisdom of the crowd.

Mining is inherently 'unfair'. Some miners will always have a competitive advantage, leading to centralisation of mining which was a concern well before ASICBoost.
The issue is the conflict between a competitive advantage and a proposed change in the code. Miners can veto any code changes and will only allow changes that are in their economic interest.
They are greedy by design. To change the code you have to buy them out, probably by making a case for greater income through mass adoption.

I think everyone's forgetting something. Increased volume and a higher bitcoin price was supposed to make up for the halvings way before transaction fees kicked in. Transaction fees were something to worry about in the 2030's, not 20-ruddy-16.
Restricted volume, strangulated prices and now transaction fees plus the halving is a quadruple whammy for miners. And it's self-inflicted. Because they are doing it all backwards.

We have to consider the possibility that the protocol has already ossified. This was suggested over a year ago when it became clear that anonymity wasn't going to become a core blockchain feature despite it being in big demand and something the inventors of the Web say they wish they had included from Day 1. All the recent end-user benefits have come in the form of known properties being implemented (e.g. multisig). Personally I think we have had enough discussion and Gavin needs to set a timetable for this. There is a big difference between centralisation and showing a bit of leadership. Let Mike Hearn and Peter Todd set a timetable for their proposals as well and let's see which one the crowd follows.

especially), require double spending databases (seems inevitable with
software systems), and **probably not suitable for very low value
transactions.**  But nevertheless I think a departure from the banking
mindset (trust the bank), towards systems which avoid the need for
risk management overheads, and where the whole system is distributed
are interesting to explore.
I appreciate all the effort that seems to have gone into trawling old emails in support of the current meme that "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" was never intended to be a currency, but instead a crippled settlement layer.
But 'probably not suitable for low-value transactions' is meaningless unless the terms 'probably', 'not suitable' and 'low-value' are defined.
'Low-value' could mean anything from a millionth of a penny, through the average consumer spend on coffee, or groceries up to…whatever.
'Not suitable' could mean either 'unsuitable' or 'not best suited (but could work)'.
'Probably' implies a probability between 0 and 1 of whatever is meant by the other two variables. You can probably do anything that is possible.
Sorry to nitpick one sentence apart but I doubt even the author can remember what was going through his head when he wrote that so long ago and it certainly wasn't the problem we have now.
Bitcoin is the native token of the only trustless public blockchain. It is scarce and useful, therefore valuable and as a result is being traded as a commodity and in use as a currency. Clunky, yes, but currency nevertheless.
To deny bitcoin as a de-facto currency in support of the idea that all true currencies must emerge out of the second tier (Ethereum, LN) is to put bitcoin in the same category as Special Drawing Rights from the International Monetary Fund ('neither a currency, nor a claim on the IMF. Rather, it is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members').
If bitcoin is going down that route, I'd rather own 'SDR' bitcoin, than the currencies that will be derived from it.

I was just summing up their reply. Kudos to GM for exposing this, but he says they are using it, they say they aren't (because if they did, it would undermine the whole ecosystem).
You say 'obviously, they are' and cite the empty blocks as the proof. The rest of it (opposition to SegWit, domination of the mining sector) is circumstantial. It's only obvious if you want to see it.
My point is that they have come back with a flat rebuttal. Perhaps attack is the best form of defense but you have to have some cojones to deny this outright if it's true.
If it was me I'd front it out and say it's an optimisation. That's what the Jihan apologists are saying anyway and it's a credible line.

The risk of having a real-world transaction reversed is miniscule and part of the protocol. Six transactions was only recommended because it was longer than the longest fork at the time (which was four I think). Zero confirmations is OK if you are splitting a bill between friends, 30 is some ridiculously high arbitrary number suggested by one of the devs to reinforce his point that only his approach will save the currency. If you are receiving bitcoins you just need to make a decision about how many confirms your goods are worth.
To spend bitcoins and get them refunded you have to know when a fork is coming (unlikely) and find a mug punter who doesn't understand confirmations to sell you something valuable quick smart and somehow get your bitcoins confirmed on the wrong chain before the system autocorrects. Short forks happen all the time. Give me a break. The reason this one is significant is that it bodes ill for the hard fork because it shows people are running irresponsibly out-of-date clients.

I do appreciate the trouble you have taken to reply and I am duly impressed with the math and the links. My point really was that without a guarantee from a counterparty it's up to everyone to assess the risk for themselves (including LocalBitcoins who might want to reconsider their three confirmations in the light of recent events).
Implying that I'm not concerned with safety of other people's money just because I want to keep a bit of convenience by adopting the risk myself is not fair. I seem to be trapped in some Through the Looking Glass world where suddenly most of the devs are hell bent on deterring anyone from using bitcoin. I have a lot of respect for the devs, but sometimes things work in practise but not in theory.
(Incidentally have you tried to sell $10,000 of bitcoin quickly on LocalBitcoin? You'd be lucky to do it in a month, let alone a block. I think they might notice one customer recycling $60,000 an hour-but perhaps not.)

You are quite right that governments adjust the money supply to maintain stable exchange rates and the population doesn't like it's currency to fluctuate in value. This is not possible with bitcoin, so its value increases or decreases based on demand. Since it is a global currency, it makes more sense to use it as the base against which all fiat currencies are measured. It's a feature, not a bug and the inability of a centralized authority to prevent the value rising (by firing up the printing presses) is central to its appeal.

Two competing forks are inherently unstable by design. They would quickly resolve into one, whether the support was initially split 51%/49% or 99%/1%. The higher the number, the quicker it would resolve; but 51% would quickly become 61% which would immediately become 90% and so on.
Too many people have jumped on to the bandwagon without learning this basic fact.

That's a misconception. The market doesn't have to set the price of bitcoin high enough to cover miners' costs. Miners look at the price of bitcoin, deduct their desired profit margin and spend the difference mining.
If bitcoins went up then the money spent on mining would go up the same, until some external factor (cost of coal, lack of water for hydro, natural gas prices go through the roof, outcry at global warming from bitcoin ASICs etc.) exerted an external and equal downwards pressure on mining.

If payment can wait, can it wait a few seconds (for transaction to be broadcast with low risk of fraud), or up to one hour (for one confirmation, low risk of chain reorganisation) or for a few hours (multiple confirmations, payment pretty well guaranteed)?

Such confusion over value.
Bitcoin is valuable because it's useful and scarce. It's usefulness (as a money, as a ledger etc.) is its intrinsic value.
It's not 'declared' to be useful, usefulness is an emergent property so it's not fiat, it's a sovereign (debt-free) money. If you're going to argue it's fiat then it's the math that makes the promise.
Gold is valuable as jewelry, in industry and as money (historically)/store of value (currently) in decreasing order. Gold has lots of drawbacks as a money that bitcoin doesn't (portability, security, verification, pseudonymity etc). The total value of the 'gold as store of value' market is about $1,000,000,000,000, when bitcoin reaches this it will stop.
It is illegal to refuse to accept Government paper/plastic money in settlement of a debt, so it's useful for acquiring stuff and paying taxes, but it isn't scarce so you shouldn't buy any more than you can afford to lose.

Somewhat rude.


A fully-paid up contract to buy a bitcoin at a future date is as good as a bitcoin. The only difference is that it isn't counted in the 21MM cap.


Cash settlement means that futures traders don't have to buy the asset that underlies their contracts, so the contract price can differ from the spot price.
ETFs have to constantly match their contracts with actual holdings, they aren't allowed to sell 'empty' contracts.


Correct, however if you start slowly and build up volume, then bulls never get a chance because of the poison you're dripping all over them. Ask any gold or silver bug.


The risk is asymmetric. If bitcoin is $8000 in the market, will I sell more contracts at $7000, or $9000?
Would you rather wait for a store to have yet another sale, or volunteer to pay over the store price now in case they put their prices up massively in future?


I do agree with you on that.
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:12:10
No. I am a futures trader (say). Bitcoin is $8000. I offer to sell your girlfriend the option to buy you a bitcoin next week on your birthday for $7900. She agrees (she'd be mad not to at that price). She pays me a commission for taking the 'risk'.
Everybody sees that bitcoin's on sale next week, so nobody pays more than $7900. Spot price moves down to Futures' price.
She says she's 'bought you a bitcoin for your birthday'. (She hasn't, she's bought you a futures contract but as far as she's concerned it's a legal deal and the same thing).
You might fall out and she might instead sell the contract to a friend who wants 'a bitcoin'.
On your birthday you buy a bitcoin or keep the cash, I don't care. Everybody takes the money. Even if they buy a bitcoin I'm back at the same game next month.
The more contracts I sell, the less upside risk there is, the more the market moves to meet me, the more commission I make.
I make the market by creating as many 'contractual' bitcoins as I need. These bitcoins add to the supply while they exist and are then liquidated into fiat when the contract expires, just in time for me to create the next batch.

A few people will pay more this week, rather than wait and pay less next week, but these would be 'distress' purchases. There are always people who have to sell low or buy high.
Futures are settled in cash so no bitcoins need to be 'stocked up'. I would react to any upside risk by selling more contracts into the market so that everyone who wants a bitcoin at my price can get one.
Who would be dumb enough to pay more than the low price I was guaranteeing?
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:47:54




No, you were rude and called my arguments clueless marketbabble and bullshit. That doesn't advance your argument.


My point was that a valid futures contract (the right to buy a bitcoin) is tantamount to a bitcoin. When it is settled is irrelevant to that point. By 'fully-paid-up' I meant fully valid, not 'paid in advance', my bad.
The fact you have spent so much time refuting points I never made or that are irrelevant to the thrust of why futures are exerting a downward pressure on the market is appreciated, but I regret not helpful.


I agree. The fact you can't see that this is integral to my argument is disappointing. I never said that bitcoins can be created and destroyed on a whim.
A bitcoin futures contract effectively brings a bitcoin into existence. One side counts on owning one, the other side is under an obligation to facilitate the ownership.
Futures contracts constantly create and liquidate 'paper bitcoins'. The fact that contracts can be liquidated whereas bitcoins theoretically cannot, and your refutations of other points I never made, do not really add anything.

I don't think that's right. It can't be unethical to do something ethical.
I think Dimon's problem is that it's hypocritical to sell something you think is rubbish. This is very similar to the jeweler Gerald Ratner affair.
During a speech, Ratner commented:
“We ... do cut-glass sherry decanters complete with six glasses on a silver-plated tray that your butler can serve you drinks on, all for £4.95. People say, "How can you sell this for such a low price?", I say, "because it's total crap."”
Dimon is also sneering at his customers but you have to show that he knows he's trading bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:32:18
tl;dr Futures markets are equivalent to creating bitcoins (over the 21MM limit) and selling them.
I think he's right about futures but they don't suppress price in the way he describes. Ensuring supply constantly runs ahead of demand, by manipulating every mainstream media channel is a bit far-fetched.
I think futures contracts suppress price because every futures contract mints new 'bitcoins' out of fiat (because they are settled in fiat). A contract for a bitcoin == a bitcoin.
This reduces scarcity and therefore reduces value. So, futures contracts trade below spot price in anticipation of reduced scarcity. This puts a downward pressure on price.
In fact, the more futures contracts that are issued, the more bitcoin moves down to meet the contracts' price. After all, who is going to buy a bitcoin if they can buy a 'future' bitcoin for much less?
Futures become a self-fulfilling prophecy; and the downward rachet ensures it only works one way, down. If futures had to be settled in the commodity they were speculating on this wouldn't work, as they would have to buy the underlying asset (like ETFs).

Technically all the halvings are already priced in, but the effect on price is dependent on how far they are away.
It's like buying a house with a 999-year lease or a 5-year lease. As the lease gets shorter over time, the price of the lease goes down.
With the halvings it's the opposite. They are increasingly priced in the closer they get. Plus some people don't know about halvings at all until a few weeks beforehand (human nature) so that causes a late blip.
However don't forget that the next halving will only bring inflation in the money supply closer to the QE in fiat. We are still in quite an inflationary phase until 2024. Then, the money supply really tightens.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:34:13
If you 'buy' or denominate some of your holdings in BTC then you gain from any rise relative to fiat, that's the main benefit.
If lots of people hold their balance in BTC then they have to buy BTC to hedge against a rise in BTC, so that's a secondary benefit.
It's almost like an ETF in your pocket. If you cashed out of an ETF it would have to be into fiat. An ETF wouldn't let you cash out their bitcoins.

We're not talking about credit accounts and payment terms but the fact that bitcoin is settled when paid (there is nil delay due to third parties being involved) so there's no opportunity to arbitrage bitcoin by claiming 'it's in the Post' or 'Don't worry we've got it in our vault'.
If you've got 5 bitcoin all you can lend is 5 bitcoin. Since your reserve must always be greater than your lending you can't do what is commonly called 'fractional reserve' banking where your creditors are less than (=a 'fraction' of) your lending.

This is the correct answer.
Because it's a sovereign currency (and not debt-based) you don't need to keep printing it into oblivion. A loan merely increases demand which puts the price of a bitcoin up.
As demand ebbs and flows the bitcoin price goes up and down, it's part of the design. With mass adoption the price will be stable but still responsive to demand.
Imagine you want to rent a flat. In a mixed economy, you give the landlord one bitcoin. Every month he works out how much it is worth (denominated in fiat) and spends the difference. When you move out, he gives you back the fiat equivalent of the deposit, in bitcoin.
To simplify it in a full bitcoin economy, you give a bitcoin and get half a bitcoin back, half representing the rent. One bitcoin represents the deposit at the outset and half represents the deposit at the end.
If you can't raise the deposit then you can't rent a flat, that doesn't change.

Supposing instead something was valuable because it was aesthetic and scarce like a unique digital song and you made a digital approximation that would never validate. Would it retain its aesthetic appeal? Probably. Would it have the same value as an original? No.
Ergo - instant property rights, based on resale value. (Cost of song minus resale, is less than cost of fake). You won't abolish piracy but it will be very clear which are the pirated copies and the digital content might only be served up if you have the correct private key.

Fractional reserve doesn't mean you keep a fraction of your deposits in reserve numbnuts, it means your reserves are only a fraction of your lending.
Since bitcoins are transferred and settled simultaneously you can't send any you don't have, and you can't pretend to have any you don't.

I agree with you completely except in one important respect. Going long or short does not affect the market symmetrically, since it is easier to cause markets to fall with misinformation, than it is to make them rise. Therefore markets where unregulated aggressive or naked shorting is practised are (on balance) driven downwards, which reinforces the tendency to short. We all end up owning stocks, currencies and commodities that would be worth more if trading was restricted, which is why naked short selling and hedging downwards has frequently been banned.

Refilling your machine by paying for a bond in fiat, that pays out interest in bitcoin sounds incredibly complicated. Much better to generate it or pay 21 to top it up occasionally if it can't mine. The idea is to earn bitcoin by selling your IP so it's not really an issue.

I run a full node from home with no effect on other uses and my only concern is being DDOSd therefore getting into trouble with my ISP. Once you've downloaded the Blockchain you shouldn't need to do it again. If every node was a bitcoin faucet you'd have a lot more. It seems all of Luke-jr's arguments boil down to the block size running ahead of the hardware. At times this might be true but mostly not.

You're assuming that it would be more sensible to preload the device by removing the ASIC? That would change the nature of the device from a node/massively multiplayer miner back to a Raspberry Pi node. I'm assuming it needs unfettered (full node) access to the Blockchain to check on your digital property rights.
A PC that can mine (even at a loss) is much more attractive to consumers. What's the first question everyone asks? 'How do I mine bitcoin?' and then 'How do I earn some'? Perhaps it will come preloaded with say $5 of bitcoin but not at the expense of the hardware. Someone's done some spreadsheeting on this I'm sure.
Plus it never runs out of bitcoin so it's always functional. Spending 5 cents on electricity to carry out a 2 cent bitcoin transaction isn't such a bad deal if you don't know that's what it costs and you're selling a 5$ asset. People leave appliances plugged in all the time that use far more electricity at rest.

It's tempting to think that bitcoin defies the laws of economics but it's simply a case of supply and demand.

That's going to end well. There may be a number of leveraged bitcoin exchanges and/or derivatives we don't know about, human greed being what it is (although not as bad as the 98 per cent of gold that exists on paper only) which will depress the price.

It's true there is a risk that you might need to liquidate an asset at a time when it is worth less than it was when you bought it.
The problem is that fiat is always worth less than it was when you bought it and never more. That's why the poor stay poor, because the creators of fiat leech their wealth.
At least with bitcoin, the 'fiat' promise is based on math so you can make an objective assessment. Saying poor people shouldn't buy bitcoin is like saying they shouldn't use faxes, email or web sites.

tl;dr  Bitcoin is neither a Ponzi scheme nor a Pyramid scheme. It is a tangible digital asset with money- and commodity-like properties traded globally in a free market.
Bitcoin is a purely digital asset. Thanks to the blockchain it is the first digital asset that is safe from counterfeiting, therefore I think we can confidently say it is tangible and exists in a way no other digital asset has.
It is valued because it is useful and scarce. This is the same as having value. It's usefulness and scarcity give it value but there is no 'enterprise' behind it. It has that in common with Ponzi schemes but that doesn't make it a Ponzi scheme.
Bananas are yellow, but we don't say that everything yellow is a banana. Bitcoin promises no interest, no rate of return. It has no mechanism to pay a dividend. Ponzi schemes are characterised by a promise of large dividends.
Some bitcoin holders expect a large capital gain. That is not the same as a dividend. It is not promised or 'guaranteed'. There is no central authority to gain from making such a promise, or even make it.
This is why your comparison with a Ponzi scheme is fatally flawed.
Is bitcoin a pyramid scheme? A pyramid scheme sells an overpriced good in such a way that part of the profit flows upwards to every tier. Goods must be sourced from the tier above.
People participate in a pyramid scheme, because they believe the good is fairly priced and they will receive a regular income from sales further down the pyramid. This is, of course, a mathematical impossibility. There is a strict hierarchy. There is a premium to join. Later/lower members pay more to buy the goods by diktat although the sale price remains static. Price discovery reduces the profit and sales fall until the pyramid collapses.
In bitcoin there is no hierarchy. You can buy bitcoins from anyone. There is rigourous price discovery. Later buyers pay more or less, depending on price movement. Bitcoin operates in the free market. There is no premium to join.
I can see the putative link, in that early adopters have an asset which they sell to a buyer who expects in turn to sell at a profit. In a pyramid scheme that expectation is created by the seller who also performs the price discovery. In bitcoin the buyer is an independent actor who creates his own expectations in a free market.
The profits of early bitcoin adopters is a premium on their research and development. It is fairly gained.
In conclusion bitcoin is neither a Ponzi scheme nor a Pyramid scheme. It is a tangible digital asset with money- and commodity-like properties traded globally in a free market.

My point, Mr Redditor For 12 Days, is that today is poor timing to allege that bitcoin is volatile (implying that it's a poor store of value/unit of account and therefore a poor candidate for a currency).
Bitcoin is an 'exotic' so it shouldn't currently be benchmarked against the dollar. It's proving to be an outstanding store of value and on course to be the best performing asset of the year (again) (again).
Bitcoin's alleged volatility is passed out as an opinion like a conversational leaflet, by the footsoldiers of the opposition. Volatility and criminal conduct are the easily recognisable hallmarks of a person who has neither the intellect not the inclination to think independently.

There is an enormous potential market for the dollar. It could still replace many other national currencies, either officially or unofficially. The number of dollars in world circulation could double, then double again. Nobody knows how big.
The Fed will only have to stop printing when the purchasing power of a dollar goes into decline. This is the signal. No inflation of prices, no need to stop printing. This could be decades away or it could be tomorrow.
The dollar is still a relatively stable currency and store of value, it's highly liquid and backed up by the US' legal and cultural values, which a lot of the world aspires to. Dollars allow you to 'buy into' America, a huge continent teeming with natural resources with a developed infrastructure.

That's correct up until the point you equate a public ledger with lack of privacy.

That's not true. Most public bodies will accept submissions from anyone who appears to have a valid opinion sent in good faith.
It's easier for them to formulate policy by getting others to suggest it, rather than do it themselves and it gives them a measure of public opinion.
The SEC referred to Stolfi's submission, now we have the extra job of refuting it. More people should have sent submissions the first time when policy was less ossified.

You are asking the wrong question. A Ponzi scheme promises a rate of return (interest) on an investment, not capital growth.
As the interest is paid out of new investment, it is true to say that there is no basis to pay dividends on existing shares.
The shares exist. The new investment exists. It is the basis for payment of the dividends (the 'enterprise' or the wealth-generating business) that doesn't exist.
Arguing with Jorge over whether an asset is an asset or exists after it has been digitised is fruitless if not pointless.

You call this 'all my retirement money'. Is it truly all your retirement money, or is it just unexpected money from this supplier, all intended for your retirement?
What were your plans for retirement before you found you had this money? This is a missing piece of the jigsaw. Also--how close are you to retirement?
You are considering a high risk investment which will likely produce a large gain or a large loss. Early in your life you can do this because you have time to recover if things go wrong. As you approach retirement you will want to move your wealth into assets that have a lower return but are unlikely to vanish.
Remember that there aren't enough bitcoins for everyone in New York to own one, let alone the World. If things go as planned you won't need a lot of bitcoins to retire.

Bitcoin can be used as a placeholder for a debt in the expectation that it can be redeemed for an equivalent value in cash or work etc.
Example: I go out for a meal. My friend pays. I owe him $10. I give him $10 worth of bitcoin which he can redeem from me or someone else. Someone else offers him $12 because they can redeem it for $12 from someone who wants to send $12 by email. This is price discovery at work.

You are, of course, speculating about how gold was viewed 'initially'. It is equally likely that there was a period when it was a mere curiosity, being too soft to make into weapons or tools, in the same way that oil seeping out of the ground was viewed as a pollutant of good farming land.
Bitcoin cannot be easily obtained or forged. It is durable. The only difference is that the price of gold is less volatile, making it (currently) a better store of value. There is no reason bitcoin should not be adopted by the wealthy, if this happens then volatility will decrease.
Gold has been regarded as the perfect store of value because of its properties (mainly longevity and rarity) but there are many alternatives (fine art, land). In contrast there are unlikely to be any alt-coins that will pose a serious challenge to bitcoin. What you regard as externalities (network hashing rate, network effect), are a defence mechanism that the dominant crypto-currency uses to kill its siblings in the womb.
In summary, bitcoin also possesses all the properties you unilaterally attribute to gold apart from price stability, and the nature of any dominant crypto-currency is more suited to killing off its rivals than the nature of gold is to killing off silver (for example).

This is just another form of gambling. You try and predict the future price of something. Of course that would be too easy, so in real life you have to predict the future price of something better than somebody else.
To win this game you need to have better information than your opponent, such as insider information (illegal but possible), use collusion (form an investor's club that decides in secret to buy or sell in concert) or just do better research.
Once you are set, you need to find a steady stream of mug punters to bet against you and lose ('open a trading account today for just $1').
If you are hooked, you can borrow money to gamble. You have to put up collateral. You can win bigger, but if you lose you also lose bigger. One person just lost $2 million dollars betting the bitcoin price would go down. Less interestingly in other news, some other people on the other side of that trade won $2 million dollars betting it would go up / causing it to go up.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
The interesting aspect is that gamblers (and economists) believe that the 'efficient market' theory (where all known and relevant information is factored into the price of something) means it is a level playing field. It is never a level playing field. Someone always knows something you don't, and they will eat your lunch.

People love to gamble. If bitcoin goes up, a lot of people bet it's going to go down.
If it doesn't go down, they have to buy bitcoin to pay their bets. This makes the price go up more and the whole thing accelerates.

This is a feature, not a bug and was anticipated in the original spec. Whether it's 'inordinate' is a matter of opinion.

There are millions of mug punters out there who have got bits of paper 'proving' they own gold/oil/pork bellies they could never collect. And they don't want to collect them, just trade them like kids trading cards in the playground.

Your statement implied (possibly unintentionally, possibly not) that it was intended that miners' income should be supplemented by transaction fees from the very beginning. This is not true.
I wanted to clarify that it was intended that there should be a long period of increasing adoption before fees replace seigniorage, when the block reward runs out.
The block reward runs out in 2140 but it was generally agreed that it would be negligible after 2040 even with the large run up in price expected from general adoption.
The premature introduction of fees before general adoption and concomitant price increase has caused the system to stall to the point of putting it back some years.
Asking for fees in addition to seigniorage at a time when miners are still inflating the money supply at 4 per cent, and before general adoption, is madness caused by opportunistic greed.
I seem to be the only person reminding everyone that the costs of hashing should follow income and not the other way around. It's not our job to keep the miners solvent, especially when the network is so oversecured.

I would point out that the existing system does not give them the protection they are looking for.
Bitcoin doesn't rely on the Web, the blockchain can be exchanged on hard drives or USB sticks or beamed down by private satellites and transactions can be carried out with smoke signals if necessary, but to kill bitcoin on the Web, you would need to shut down the whole Web, worldwide. Clearly a silly objection.
Alternatively you would need to ban trading in assets that were not government-approved. That battle has been lost, except in Russia and a few other places who want to dwell in the financial Dark Ages.
In order to ensure your anti-bitcoin laws were obeyed, you would have to take unbreakable cryptography back out of the hands of the public. This battle was lost years ago (although it breaks out again from time to time in the US).
As Pres. Obama said, bitcoin is like having a Swiss (numbered) bank account in your pocket. A bank account where you are only identified by a number has historically been seen as the 'gold standard' in anonymity by most people. It can only be compromised by either voluntarily associating yourself with that pseudonym or being revealed by a whistleblower (possible with banks but not with bitcoin).
While the Government can see the economic activity they cannot make any sense of it. Once you get through AML on the border, you are on your own to do what you like.

I'm not going to dispute a hypothetical.
Peter thinks the bitcoin price is fuelled by irrational exuberance for an asset with no value.
I think bitcoin is valuable because it is useful and scarce. It is growing organically and the price jump reflects a raft of good news (acceptance in Japan, tax relief in Australia, ETF appeal, miners increasingly signaling for capacity increase etc.)
Trouble is, some people call every rapid price increase a 'bubble'. Peter even has a special contemptuous way of saying 'bbubbble' with 5 'b's. Saying something is a 'bubble' is just another way of saying 'I can't understand why this asset is valued at that price'. He can't conceptualise bitcoin, so of course he dismisses it. It's a natural reaction.
Something can be under- or over-valued at any price, but his declaration that he is now closed minded on the issue of whether bitcoin is a bubble right up to and past $100,000 seems to indicate that his reputation hasn't got long to last.

You are correct, but we are talking about real life here. If I split a cheque and a friend of mine pays me back in bitcoin, after I watch him fiddle with his phone I don't even think about that payment any more.
Knowing a transaction has been broadcast gives me enough confidence to disregard that small debt. For a lot of people that might be enough.
You are also right that RBF doesn't kick in to reverse transactions until confidence levels are higher, which makes it worse in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-05-04 04:52:39
Let me explain it to you. The bank holds 1 bitcoin but lends out 100. Ninety-nine fake bitcoins now exist on paper. The upper limit on coins goes from 21 million to 2.1 billion. Bitcoins are still useful, but no longer scarce. The value of a bitcoin falls to 4 dollars for you and me, but the bank has 1 bitcoin and 100x4=400 dollars so it is unaffected. You suggest that the bank be forced to cryptographically prove its reserves. The bank laughs at you.

Not in the sense that critics deploy this argument. I don't think you meant to phrase it that way in any case. There's nothing wrong with jumping in on an appreciating asset for profit. It's the smart thing to do.
If by 'many' you mean 'some' who are buying, simply assuming they can sell for more later, then yes - there will always be speculators who buy without doing their homework to ride on the upward momentum or believe that past performance is a good indicator of the future. Sometimes they get burned, sometimes not.
If by 'many', you mean 'most' then no - if you look at a log graph of weekly price for the last year you will see a steady % rise. There's no reason to believe that bitcoin is currently significantly overvalued, relative to its value proposition and likely demand. I expect it to calm down after the ETF appeal decision on 15 May (or go ballistic, depending on result).

The figure 6 only arose because it was longer than the longest 'fork' that had spontaneously rearranged at that time, therefore was considered 'safe'.
Six confirmations will delay the sale by one hour on average and possibly much longer. Zero, one or two confirmations are generally enough, depending on the goods or services sold.

Creation of credit that isn't based on genuine prosperity undermines society, that's before we even discuss its fair distribution.


He would need to buy some, the same way he buys his holiday currency and his wife's jewellery. It would always be for sale at the market price.
Societies used gold as a currency for hundreds of years and it worked very well.


With bitcoin, the transfer IS the settlement. Coloured tokens require a second party to deliver on the promise and a third party to enforce delivery if it is not forthcoming.




That is not the only, or even the main, difference. Bitcoin has merely been a threat around which some banks have unified to upgrade their antiquated infrastructure. Corporate databases are still based on trust. It is misnomer to even call them blockchains.

The second one 'Dappy' was a student who smashed her phone and replaced it and forgot it had some bitcoin on it and hadn't kept a copy of the seed.
The third one 'SOL' was a woman who did make a copy of the seed, then dropped her phone in with the dishes. Some helpful person got it going again but didn't realise there was a wallet on it. When she looked for the seed which she kept on a piece of paper in an old handbag, her daughter had borrowed the bag and 'cleared it out'.

I mean, saying that Satoshi never mentioned the Blockchain in the White Paper, because he wrote 'block chain' instead of 'blockchain'?? Blockchain (without the space and/or capitalised) was a convention that emerged from use, a bit like calling typefaces 'fonts'.
We all know that 'Blockchain' is the new buzzword in finance so I don't think this article added too much.

Surely you are looking at it backwards? Most of the value of gold as a currency is historical, relatively few people trade it for its industrial potential. Theoretically there may be fewer elements to use as an alternative than there are possible alt-coins, but in both cases value is derived from usefulness as a money and scarcity. Bitcoin is better than gold because it is scarce and infinitely divisible (try buying and storing 10 atoms of gold) in addition to it's transmissibility etc. 
Any element could be used as a money if you required your money to have different properties but gold turns out to be the best physically. Bitcoin is the best digital money by virtue of first mover advantage and network effect. In a metaphysical world, it's the best 'metaphysically'.
Yes, in an alternative reality Litecoin or a bitcoin with 5-minute confirmations might be the main digital currency, but not in our Universe any time soon.

Gavin is in two groups. He is a) with the rest of us, left with a ridiculous non-proof and he is also b) privy to a private demonstration of an absolute mathematical proof.
As stated in this video ( Gavin saw CW sign a contemporaneous message of Gavin's choosing, using the private key of block  on a computer and using software that appeared to be standard issue. I think that's about all the proof you can ask one person to witness in one demonstration on one occasion.
In the public court case of CW v. Reddit I think it's likely Gavin is giving evidence in good faith but the jury has not found it compelling and feels he may have been duped; and has ruled against CW on the balance of probability unless new evidence comes to light.
I am not going to get into a detailed consideration of the evidence which is ambiguous. For example they could have used a VPN to download Electrum (likely, in a hotel room) so they may not have appeared to be in the UK.
I find your assertion that Gavin hatched a plan to invent a fake Satoshi, who would last long enough to back him up on the block size issue, laughable. Andresen does not have to 'remain relevant'. He could retire tomorrow and he would still be entitled to plinth number 2 in the bitcoin Hall of Fame.

Governments are going to increasingly try to enforce statutory payments in their currency. It's the Government's willingness to accept the local currency in payment of debt that puts the 'fiat' into 'fiat currency'.
We need to be prepared to convert 'hard' currencies like gold and bitcoin back into local fiat to pay statutory debts as and when required.
This is part of a plan (which will fail) to make fiat currency ubiquitous on the grounds that it satisfies so much Government-imposed debt. It will fail because so much value will be held in hard currencies off balance sheets, that there will be no fiat to tax.
Cash is a separate issue. That's an AML measure to stop money launderers using the government as a Washomat.

First, governments will only ever accept their own currency (or another one, like the US Dollar). They are never going to start accepting Starbucks vouchers, chickens or bitcoin in lieu of fiat.
Secondly this is a pro-fiat thing, not an anti-bitcoin thing (although it is an anti-non-fiat thing).

Coinbase needs to hire a PR firm to get a grip on things.
Let's assume they want to improve their customer service and transaction speeds but are overwhelmed by noobs, don't want to have anything to do with BCC (and would rather the few customers who do withdrew their coins to split them). But if BCC does take off, they would reluctantly do something (rather than steal the coins) and find a way to allow customers to withdraw their BCC.
The public's perception of Coinbase is a company that has no customer support, processing delays, intends to steal your bitcoin dividend and you must withdraw all your funds immediately.
A good PR firm could close the gap between perception and reality. People take bad news better than no news.

You sound like my 4-yr-old niece. Confirmation is not a binary condition. Nothing is ever confirmed 100%. Confidence rises with every block in which the transaction is included. You know this.
A transaction that has been broadcast on the network but not yet included in a block has a level of confidence which may be adequate. Once a transaction has been broadcast in good faith, with an adequate fee it's quite tricky to rescind it. Or at least it was until RBF came along.

Everybody will realise some of the gain on their investments at some point in their life but there's something a bit whiffy about this fairy story.
Your choice to sell some of your bitcoin (as opposed to your other, less well performing stocks with less up-side potential) indicates a faulty decision relay circuit and your portfolio got royally burned as a result.
If you had just kept the faith, you could have paid off double the student debt and bought the University, but you sold because you thought bitcoin was irrationally overpriced. This is because you don't (and never did) understand the fundamentals. You think significant elements of bitcoins' success are random.
I can understand selling bitcoin to reduce a portfolio's volatility approaching retirement but killing the hens that lay the golden eggs to get some money?
I think you don't want to be remembered as the idiot who sold half his bitcoin, so you've come back to try and give your story a happy ending. I have two children. I don't refer to them as 'my adult children'. If they've got student loans it's implied they are adults.
And I don't understand this 'Sell now, you can always buy more later' schtick. Nobody ever made money selling then re-buying at a higher price.

'Creating liquidity' is another way of saying 'printing money out of thin air'. It is not appropriate and doesn't apply to bitcoin. Liquidity in bitcoin is created when the asset increases in value, so the total amount of bitcoin (measured in other currencies) increases.
Similarly, third party tokens (or 'coloured' coins) rely on a third party to redeem them. Bitcoins and bona fide alt coins are bearer bonds where the settlement occurs simultaneously with the transfer. They are inherently valuable.
Tokens are merely an immutable record on the blockchain of a third-party debt. They require the issuer to be around to provide the value.
This is also the difference between bitcoin proper and corporate blockchains.

They aren't real users, they are people swapping bits of paper promising counterfeit government debt with bits of paper promising counterfeit bitcoins.
Any asset that is widely counterfeited will lose value. I know that bitcoin is the only asset that can be cryptographically audited but most people can't differentiate between ownership and a tradeable 'certificate'of ownership.
Your government could make fractional reserve banking in bitcoin illegal but not all governments will, and why should they when they are the biggest counterfeiters to start with?
This is not an argument against bitcoin, but fractional reserve banking and commodity fraud. Bitcoin is the only asset class you can easily prove ownership of with a digital certificate so it might be the only asset class immune from fractionating.

I think an ETF must possess sufficient of its underlying asset to underwrite the shares it issues. So a gold ETF must own the gold to cover the paper it writes.
There are other gold derivatives (paper the face value of which is linked to / 'derived from' the gold price) that don't have to be fully underwritten and can be leveraged, which is why there is 200-500 times as much paper gold as there is physical.
People who don't want the bother of taking delivery or storing gold will accept an IOU if they think they can sell it to someone else for the same price or more. The price of default is built into the paper, but the fact that the paper can occasionally be redeemed for gold depresses the price of the physical asset. Providing only a few people actually redeem, the system doesn't collapse and gold stays cheap.
Bitcoins work differently. There's no penalty for settling every trade or storing them, so the number of bitcoins traded can exactly match the number on existence. Every trade brings with it, instant settlement.
Supposing that you don't want to store bitcoins so you trade/buy a derivative. You can demand that the paper issuer proves (mathematically) that they are not leveraged, so (unlike gold) you can be certain that you can redeem your paper, without even taking delivery.
So it's technically impossible to leverage bitcoin derivatives and the price stays high (unless you choose to be scammed). Particularly for ETFs which by law have to own all the bitcoins they issue paper for.

Tl dr; Bitcoin is valuable because it's useful and scarce.
Bitcoin is useful because it is a breakthrough in computer science. It is the world's first digital good that is provably unique. The most obvious first use, for a unique digital asset, is as a money.
Bitcoin is issued at a rate which is fixed and known in advance. This is secured by Game Theory. Miners (the only people who could change this) are paid in bitcoin and will not do anything to cause a collapse in value (for example, making it less scarce).
'But bitcoin has a falling share of an increasing number of crypto-currencies-it's not scarce at all'.
Crypto-currencies are not scarce, nor are national currencies. You can choose between the Dollar, the Euro and the Venezuelan bolívar. Similarly you have a choice of digital tokens with different properties.
Simply cloning a public blockchain does not create an equal copy. Using Proof of Work, there is a period during which your clone can be destroyed by malicious actors and the value stolen. Bitcoin got through this period because it was the first mover. A clone would likely not.
Currently bitcoin is still the main game in town with first mover advantage, network effect and widespread brand recognition and over-secured by a ludicrously large amount of hash power.
National currencies are also valuable because they are useful (your creditors must accept them to settle your debt, by law) and fairly scarce.
Anything that is useful and scarce is valuable, but in addition, bitcoin naturally has the attributes of a perfect money. This makes it a valuable money.
Don't worry if people don't understand all this first time, some economic commentators can't get their heads round it. (Cough, Schiff).

Where do you think bitcoins are mined?
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:56:01
My assessment is that the miners want 2x more than SegWit. That fits in with the narrative of this sub which is anti-miner. Miners have been holding out against SegWit because what they really want is 2x, but they are prepared to compromise with SegWit and then implement 2x, because it eventually gives them what they want.
If they concede SegWit, why wouldn't they then implement the part they DO want (2x)?
The intention by SegWit supporters to reneg on the 2x part is not yet being voiced prominently because SegWit is not yet a done deal. To think you can agree SegWit2x and then run away after the SegWit part, is naïve. Especially if the ones who want the 2x are the ones securing the system.
So you come up with a plan to run away, get rid of the miners and PoW just to avoid 2x. Now it's getting stupid - (but you are going to hear a lot of this once bitcoin has got SegWit).
Add in a large dose of xenophobic ranting about the 'Yellow Peril' and you ensure that the miners implement 2x, just to give you a spanking.

What Luke is describing is a clone, not a fork. (Although clones are forks, not every fork is a clone). A fork is a fight over the protocol that is inherently unstable and therefore designed to be resolved wholly or substantially in favour of one party or the other.
A hard fork can be instantiated by any miner at any time. At this point, two coins exist to the extent of the hashpower backing them. All users have their coins on both branches.
They can go their separate ways, but by design the majority of hashpower acting in their selfish best interest will favour the branch with the most value.
The tipping point is debatable but 51 per cent would be an excellent start. One hundred per cent agreement ('everyone') is only required to close down a chain, not start a new one.

Everybody has the means to access their wealth. The way bitcoin is stored (passwords, Web sites, brokerage accounts, dongles, bearer bonds etc.) is no different from conventional wealth except it can be stored locally.
The main difference is immutability. If someone invades your home and forces you to transfer your bitcoin there is no third party bank to get it back for you.
No thief is going to believe your life savings is $10 and multisig gives too much power to a third party so the solution is time-locked funds. You need a wallet that won't send more than (say) $200 in total without 24 hours notice, similar to banks ('this vault is time-locked').
In that case every home invasion attempt would have to last 24 hours, which is unlikely because of the high chance of detection in that period.

Since the inflation is fixed, miners cannot enrich themselves through QE like the average oligarch. We are all in it together, sink or swim.

A lot(*). What's your point?
* Most critics don't know about VISA and MasterCard debit cards that can be loaded with BTC and spent anywhere, so it's greatly underestimated.

Because so few of the original contributors who know this stuff are still around, it is helpful to go back to basics sometimes to keep the debate on the rails.

Miners will not activate SegWit without going on to honour the 2x. They have more integrity than you think.

You are just describing how the current banking system could incorporate bitcoin.
Most people here wouldn't agree that a bank is solvent just because it can borrow money (if it becomes insolvent). Borrowing money to get out of debt is deprecated.
The old goldsmith's trick of giving out more notes than you have gold in the safe doesn't work with bitcoin because every depositor can check their money forms part of the bank's reserves.
Of course, if you lend your assets to a third party then they are always at risk, which is why bitcoin is a peer to peer money.

I'm only reminding people how a hard fork works.
May the miners be with you.
