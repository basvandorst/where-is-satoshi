Thanks for trying us out! Your are absolutely right about the title. Maybe we can have a description field for more information and limit the title to one line.
We currently don't convert bitcoins to USD, so you'll get the exact amount of bitcoins the product costs in your account.

Isn't Ruby able to work with a normal REST APIs? Which is what we're creating and probably the most universally usable.

Was it that bad? We pngified it for you!

Thanks! :)

Thanks! And very true. We have our own greeny buttons on most pages but there are still some default colors here and there. Fits under the 'nicer for your eyes'-bit, but check the support page again.

At the moment yes, you need to do this manually. We are looking into ways to automatically update your prices when bitcoin value changes, but that might not help much as you'll still get coins, not dollars, which could be worth double (or half) again the next day before you withdraw or spend them. Let's hope bitcoin stabilizes.
Protected downloads are coming real soon! :) Thanks for your comment.

It's a big difference. If you want to do it youself you have to generate a new address for each transaction, import it somewhere, manually check if the payment is completed, and then send the user to an url or a link to your download (which is probably not protected), again manually. We do all that stuff for you.
When you have existing webshop software we're not the best solution, and as you say, Bitpay has much better options for this.
Hopefully this explains it a bit, if there's something not clear please let us know.
And thank you for the other suggestions for the website! The T&amp;C is an important point, the rest we'll use in the further development of the website.

Thank you for the helpful information. Very true point about the trustworthiness. We noticed some bitcoin sites are 100% anonymous but are stilll used and trusted, it seems to be part of the way things work in bitcoin-land but we're not yet sure about how we're going to do this ourselves. Will use your comment in the decisions about this, thanks!

Thanks! People like you are exactly who we are building this for. :)
