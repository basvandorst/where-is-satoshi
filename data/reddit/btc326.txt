Have you tried telling them?

To the untrained eye this might not look like spam.

Your site is a basic wordpress theme with articles you probably outsourced on the cheap. It is new, as is your username. Also the site is plastered with donation buttons.....for PayPal of all things. Do you even use Bitcoin or understand how? Don't try to pretend your spam Isn't spam. That's a funnier joke than spamming the site itself. Feel sorry for anyone who upvotes or donates to this scam.

Fiat and banks will win out? Do you even 21st century bro?

Too bad he is a shill: 
Funny the whole End The Fed and Sound Money campaigns... and then dismisses the answer to it all. He's just there to keep the extreme right/libertarians who don't quite get the political system yet at bay.
edit: here he is shilling again: 
Of course you can put bitcoin in your pocket. You can print it like money in $1 worths if you want, just have to keep the key covered. Or get a Trezor etc.

I'm with DoctorDbx. I'm looking to get from point A to point B, and I probably have better things to be doing during the ride than having to put up with useless small talk or as stated, listening to someone preach to you about something you never asked about.
