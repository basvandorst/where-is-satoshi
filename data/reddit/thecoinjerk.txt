Money laundering will always be a problem in crypto or in fiat. Personally the vast majority of money comes from drugs which shouldn't be illegal in the first place. I'm all for greater freedom for people. Crypto gives us freedom.

This isn't news. This has already been known for a while.

Pretty good news! At least Bitcoin is being used!

Yes actually. Prohibition isn't working. The people will continue to do drugs regardless if it's legal or illegal. At least if it's legal we can make the stuff cleaner and less likely to kill fiends. It's horrible but I'd rather people be alive than dead.

That sign cost him his internship at the cato institute. Probably one of the most prestigious internships in america, in terms of political think tanks go. There's few think tanks that are better in America - even world wide... so honestly maybe quite a bit. 
But if i remember correctly, he got quite a bit of money from posting his address there and then he went to some crypto firm in cali. Have no idea what hes up to now.
Edit: just checked his address. Guy got 7 bitcoins or 133k so pretty decent. But that's at the height. Orrr thats 14k if you take the earliest deposit date which is like july 12 2017. You could look at when he pulled them out and determine the actual value he probably got but that takes too much effort imo.

Do you blame them? Most traditional investors aren't going to touch something so violate... i personally, dont blame them at all. Its difficult to understand, its new, and has little real world application currently (as in its not BEING USED OUT THERE). we are a bunch of niche nerds talking computer geek at each other, lol. 
I mean, i think you should have a very small percent of your portfolio betting on extremely risky things like at most 5% but this obviously varies on risk tolerance.
Its kind of sad. But outside of these echo chambers crypto is a scary investment... it lost 75% of its value over the course of 4-12 months. While i like crypto, i dont blame people for just ignoring it.
