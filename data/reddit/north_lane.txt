I read this that individuals who makes gains from the sale of crypto will be subject to CGT in the usual way, this is mentioned in the very last section of the report.
But if you are a miner or other party involved in the business of crypto, looks like the legislation is pretty light touch at this stage. As ever with anything from HMRC, probably warrants 4-5 reads and re-reads however before forming your final opinion/interpretation

My god. This was embarrassing. 
The legal dude was a rockstar! That’s the difference between someone who’s out for themselves and pushing a personal agenda (Schiff) versus someone who is speaking for the greater good and wants simply to present facts and educate (both the legal dude and Saruhan Hatipoglu, who must surely be the winner of today’s “Best Name in The Cryptosphere” competition)

I only got involved in January of this year, and even then only a little bit because I was so bewildered by everything and didn’t know what the hell I was doing. But I read and learned and got pretty hooked in by the potential of the technology, and couldn’t find a solid reason why we wouldn’t have digital money in the digital age - so took a little bit more of a plunge as I went.
I now have a little bit of three currencies, and I’ve never really made any money on anything so I’m happy with my gains so far, and have hodled all the way through (I still feel like the new boy in class, trying to be cool when I use/say hodl, and I’ve been here anonymously for months!)
Thing is, I look at some of these stories too and every now again think “bloody hell, if only” but then I think that about lots of things I didn’t do (threesome, bungee jump, living away at college - we all have our own lists)
But if you dwell on it, it kills you. Because no matter where you are or what you do, there’s always someone who’s made it better / had better luck / richer / faster car / bigger dick / bigger tits and if you let that get to you you’ll get nowhere. Way I look at it, I’m involved in what I think is one of the most exciting social and technological experiments the world has ever seen (internet excepted I guess) and if I make a bit of money at the same time, that’s a bonus.
Appreciate my circumstances may be different to yours, but just giving you a different point of view.

Just trying to open on my iPhone and seeing a white screen - nothing  else. So it does look like it’s struggling - prob because the numbers are moving so quick ha ha

Post up above is correct, between 25m and 30m credit cards in India today. About 600m debit cards also exist. However, regardless of the numbers, number of people who are willing to use them and enter their card details into any kind of website or online service is very low in my experience. 
(UK National, working with India now since 2014 in the payments space - currently in Delhi on my 29th trip....)
A fantastic, fascinating country. If you haven’t been - make a trip at some point. Melting pot of humanity doesn’t come close to describing it here. A world of opportunity - especially for Bitcoin if the RBI doesn’t ban it!!!
