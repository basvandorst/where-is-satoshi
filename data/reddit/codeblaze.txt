do your research, you're wrong. For example, Chapter 560 Section 125 from Florida’s state statutes on regulation of trade, commerce, investment, and solicitations specifically prohibits non-licensed individuals or businesses to provide currency or payment instruments exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month period.
Chapter 896 Section 101, Florida’s Money Laundering Act, prohibits the trade or business in currency of more than $10,000.

Actually, if you cash out large amounts over 10k or have frequent transactions you do need one. But in his case it probably isn't necessary. Still paypal will ban you if you mention using your account for bitcoin and  banks wont care if you get scammed cause of it

haha yes Chase Quickpay is scam on localbitcoins, only use the cash deposit options or other options where you can get cash money. Everything else is a scam on there/uses stolen credit cards. Also i doubt chase will help you if you say it was money you got for selling bitcoins. That's illegal to do if you dont have a money transmitter license.

"prohibits non-licensed individuals or businesses"
Im giving an example, every state is different. Do you want me list every different states law, you ocd retard? You were saying 10k isn't revelent but its def revelant in florida. LBC users get arrested often in florida and other states. Im just saying florida cause i live there so your advice is wrong.
