It's the same as the early days of email, or computers, or any new tech really. The simplified user interfaces are always being worked on.

The idea would be that with less new coins being generated the price of available coins would increase. Also, that perhaps the notoriety of the event will spur interest, increasing demand and further raising the price. 
Other people believe that all of this is already priced in and there will be no significant change to the value of bitcoin. 
In reality, nobody knows what is or isn't going to happen come the halvening.

Segwit did many things that this analogy doesn't convey. 
Segwit is akin to making the computer bigger. The blocks are bigger with segwit. In addition, segwit implements some important fixes to long standing pain points in the protocol. These fixes allow for future improvements to be implemented far easier and in some cases make them possible at all. Everyone who wanted a blocksize increase gets one with segwit. In addition to more space, segwit encourages more efficient use of said space. Segwit is a pretty awesome upgrade to some pretty awesome software.

If by users you mean the group of consumers doing small daily transactions (like buying a hamburger) then sure they just care about it being easy and cheap to use. 
However, that group is economically tiny compared to the actual major use cases for bitcoin. I dont think it makes sense to say "no one is going to care about bitcoin" just because some small subset of potential users currently finds it a bit of a hassle.

Coin base has one advantage over other exchanges and it's not technical. They, for some reason, get a pass from traditional finance. They have greased all the right hands and now sit comfortably in a regulatory nest. It's kind of sketchy really, especially given Strongarm's anti-bit coin behavior.  
And of course they are free to do as they like, but that doesn't mean there aren't better ways to operate. Methods that cost users less, cost coinbase less, put less load on the network, etc...

Maybe go a look up all the awesome developments in bitcoin land? Lightning, CT, signature aggregation, Schnorr, MAST, the list goes on. Bitcoin has attracted the best of the best when it comes to cryptography and distributed systems development. If bitcoin cannot achieve "fast, secure and decentralized" then no other coin can. 
DGB is a pre-mined pile of garbage. It is a clone of bitcoin (just like LTC), with some parameters tweaked so that the owner/godking of it can convince noobs that it is "better than bitcoin XOXO". Good luck with your shitcoin pumping!

You seem to think bitcoin is only good for small personal transactions. It is good for far more than just that use case!  


Why would no one want to use it after that? (Also, I would personally buy every bitcoin if they were available for peanuts) People bought bitcoin when it was worth pennies, because they have uses for it. Bitcoin is useful at any price. That's what makes it so magical. It's value is not based on its market price, it is based on what it allows people to do. Bitcoin allows people things that other technologies cannot provide. Bitcoin is valuable because it does useful stuff. It is really that simple.

**The basic idea is that there is little differentiation between a commodity coming from one producer and the same commodity from another producer.** A barrel of oil is basically the same product, regardless of the producer. By contrast, for electronics merchandise, the quality and features of a given product may be completely different depending on the producer. Some traditional examples of commodities include grains, gold, beef, oil and natural gas. **More recently, the definition has expanded to include financial products, such as foreign currencies and indexes. Technological advances have also led to new types of commodities being exchanged in the marketplace. For example, cell phone minutes and bandwidth.**  
By that description I would say bitcoin could surely count as a commodity. It is both interchangeable regardless of producer and the term commodity doesn't necessarily strictly refer to only steel and sheep.

What new thing or things is bitcoin missing that any other alt has? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:05:18
Got anything of substance? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:40:39


Wait, you're commenting on what segwit is and you don't even know all the upgrades it includes? Uh that's cool... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:13:17
But regardless, the internet itself didnt go anywhere. It just got stronger and more valuable. Buying bitcoin would be like if you could buy shares directly in the internet itself. Others that want to use the internet would need to obtain these shares as well. The shares would become quite valuable. With the internet the shares are all infrastructure (hardware and large services). With bitcoin it is a combination of infrastructure (mining equipment, services) and the exchange unit (bitcoin). So I think owning bitcoin could end up being quite useful as time goes forward.

Bitcoin is going swimmingly. The constant, steady protocol upgrades, and growth in the ecosystem is a beautiful thing! 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:35:30
Consumers always want the best. The best stuff they can reasonably get, anyhow. Bitcoin is the best money. Therefore, the consumer will eventually come to desire all the bitcoin. So far this is holding true as evidenced by the constant growth of the network and its value. 
As long as bitcoin continues to be the best money, consumer demand will continue to increase, and bitcoin will continue its spectacular rise in popularity.

You realize that having a highly decentralized base layer (bitcoin) in conjunction with a slightly more centralized layer (lightning), or even a fully centralized third-party model for small transactions (coinbase, etc) is a perfectly fine, resilient and secure design for the network? 
Having a centralized, premined, no-talent copy coin, as the base layer means the best you can do on higher layers is centralized, premined, no-talent copy crap.

Yeah lightning IS more centralized than bitcoin. That is part of the trade off for the low fees.
There is a security trade-off made on the lightning network to enable low fees, and have actually instant confirmations. The main chain (bitcoin) gets to remain decentralized, secure and easily accessible, and the smaller payments and micro payments get to move off to a network more suited to handle them. Win/win. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:09:32

You are unable to think of cool use cases for programmable money?  
* Smart contracts  
* Unforgeable token that can exist only in your brain  
* Universal timestamping/proof of existence service  
* Protocol for value management for a DAO or the like
* Allow for an efficent, decentralized energy marketplace to emerge (already happening too!)  
It's  the freaking Internet of money, the sky's the limit!  
Also, we can list the features bit coin has that no competitors do: 
-no centrally controlled money supply  
-complete bearer asset  
-unforgeable  
-borderless/nationless  
-no central point of failure  
-open source/open development  
-trustless/solves distributed trust problem  
-fully fungible  
-digitally sendable and recievable  
-nationless/nonpolitical  
-unable to be frozen or taken by a third party  
-the list goes on...  
Goddammit bitcoin is so fucking cool.

You really have trouble reading. I said bitcoin is decentralized. Bitcoin, the base layer, is decentralized. IF the base layer is decentralized, more centralized layers can be built on top of it. Thats not a problem. Bitcoin still remains decentralized. Get it? Bitcoin = decentralized. Services built on top of bitcoin != bitcoin. Still following?

I thought you liked to complain about high fees? Either you pay a decent fee and get confirmed fast, or pay a lower one and wait. Which is it? Whenever I have paid a fee recently it has confirmed fast. If I cheaped out, I waited a few more blocks. Whats the problem?

No, the facts aren't on their side. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain. Bitcoin is the basis for the incentive system that allows proof of work to function.

Segwit does not change that. Think you can explain how it does? I don't think you can.  


Nope. Just like currently, all code is open for review, all development is transparent and all code is run by voluntarily by node operators. More layers does increase the surface, but has nothing to do with trust. You're casually mixing up two unrelated things to make your point seem better.  


Forces? Oh by being completely voluntary?  


Limbo? You mean a payment channel?  


As in how ever long they want to?  


Absolutely not. LN preserves the P2P nature of bitcoin, builds on top of btcs security and adds much needed transaction throughput. LN is completely optional and totally freaking awesome.  


The current dev's would make Satoshi so proud. Bitcoin has become more resilient, more efficient, oodles faster, massively more popular, and better by nearly any metric imagineable. Bitcoin is in great hands (the whole community) and is on a beautiful path forward.

Segwit paved the way for improvements like lightning, schnorr, MAST and drivechains and countless more in the future. Segwit was a set of  direly needed improvements that enable better, cleaner code in the future. Good development takes time. Developing for bitcoin is unlike anything else.

It really is amazing when you think about it. No wonder people are starting to take notice.

I wouldn't call differences in consensus logic minor bugs. Also I think having lots of different implementations of the consensus logic guarantees there will be differences, not potentially. 
Though this debate is certainly nuanced and I don't know exactly which side of it I am on. I think we can both agree that there WILL be multiple implementations (as there currently is), so we have to make the best of the situation either way.

ETH gets made fun of because it is overly complex and seemingly fundamentally flawed by design. Contracts are too complex to be made completely bug free. 
No one said to "pile on" everything on the bitcoin blockchain. Instead, you maintain one exceptionally well vetted, widely trusted and resilient base layer (BTC, Bitcoin  protocol) and build the other stuff on top  (school credit diddlydoo). Use something like drivechains to leverage the security of the main chain but to have the needed allowances (reductions in security) required by whoever wants to use the sidechain. Likely, there will ultimately be one "main" blockchain and other apps will anchor to it. It seems to me that Bitcoin is not only the first application of blockchain tech, but also happens to bootstrap/enable the whole idea of blockchain. 


That very well may be true but it doesn't make their system a good idea. Other groups that are more willing to adapt will obsolete the old methods anyhow.

@_date: 2017-12-27 19:56:28
You misunderstand. The shards are the blockchain broken up. You need to validate all that to be full archival node. 
 Lightning transactions do not need to be recorded. Just the channel opening and closings. Those happen on the bitcoin blockchain. The only people who need to remember lightning txns are the involved parties and only until settlement. Recording lightning txns wouldn't really be possible since you won't see the vast majority of them. It would be akin to recording all of Coinbase's internal accounting. Only CB needs to worry about that and even if we wanted to we can't see that data. For the rest of us, whatever txns Coinbase puts on the Bitcoin blockchain is all we care about recording.

This statement underlines your lack of understanding of the difference between bitcoin and traditional currencies. People don't need to store their fiat in their safe at home because it isn't really theirs and it would not change anything about the safety of the fiat. 
Bitcoin, in stark contrast, can actually be owned, by one single person, in its entirety. If you hold the keys, you alone have the Bitcoin. Cash can't compete.

From everything I have read, the shards are basically the blockchain broken up. If my shard has to reference your shard to complete a computation or prove validity, then the two shard might as well be one larger unit. Separating them, but then making the segments intricately intertwined doesnt seem to be beneficial. It makes the individual shards seem smaller (the blockchain bloat problem goes away...) but it is still there, now there are just a randomly selected group of PoS participants securing each shard instead of everyone securing all of it. 


Thats pretty easy. A full archival bitcoin node is one that maintains and validates the entire history of the bitcoin blockchain. Sidechains, or drivechains or the like, are not necessary to maintain a record of unless you are participating in those side chains. They are aside from the main chain. They do not contain any interesting information from the POV of someone not involved in the chain. 


For a full archival BITCOIN node, that is everything!

If bitcoin becomes massively successful, gold won't be worth anything near what it is today. Bitcoin would entirely displace gold as a store of value. Gold would go back to just being a very useful metal. Don't get me wrong, shiny, useful metal has value, but not as much as bitcoin would.

The absolute value of that good or service did not change, just it's equivalent amount relative to whatever currency your comparing it to.

@_date: 2018-08-29 23:22:18
I think you're over inflating the effect of boutique miners. I'd wager the vast majority of hash power is run by large operations getting practically optimal power and hardware costs. You can't compete in the space otherwise. The variation in hardware and electricity costs for the majority of hashpower is minimal. The supply of bitcoin is fixed, so the demand is effectively infinite. It grows every year, while the number of new bitcoins decreases and more people hodl, taking more coins off the market. You point to the dramatic volatility  in the price as proof that mining cost != cost of btc, but I'd say it clearly shows the opposite. Take some sort of average of the bitcoin price since its inception, and you will have a chart that shows the average price to mine 1 bitcoin over time.

I meant that if they hold a certain amount of bitcoin, a long term uptrend could counteract the fluctuations (and thus risk) caused by short term volatility. 
However, their business models aren't "make money by investing" in bitcoin, so unless they are true beliebers, I don't see long term "gainzz" motivating them to support bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:20:55
Bitcoin can be used for trading, especially in these early days due to volatility, and as time goes own it gains more "real" use in the everyday lives of more and more people.

The same way everyone else does it. Likely some combination of cold and hot wallets. It sounds like you're saying it's harder for the government to manage bitcoin than dollars. But why? When the government is ready, they will codify rules for how various agencies/personnel should interact with and manage bitcoin. Same as with fiat.

You obviously still do not get it. Your first statement is just appallingly wrong. Like, it is so massively dumb that I am having trouble believing that you know how to breath. 
Actually, I am sorry. That was just mean for no reason. I will assume you are genuine and I will attempt to convey my point in a civil way. 
We have a bunch of cryptos, and they all have a monetary value. But unlike bitcoin, none of them are worth anything. Anyone can copy bitcoins code since it is open source. However, they cannot copy the history. The start of bitcoin (anonymous creator, bootstrapped by a gang of brilliant cypherpunks, no premine, etc) is part of its massive value. The massive, knowledgeable and distributed dev team is part of bitcoins massive value. The year and years of Just Working^TM is part of bitcoins massive value. The unbelievable effort that goes into analyzing the algorithms and theory behind every byte in bitcoin core is part of its massive value. The brilliant and diverse community, the memes, the non technical contributors are all a part of bitcoins massive value. The absolute glut of companies, small businesses and countries that are adopting bitcoin is part of its massive value. The fact that bitcoin solves previously unsolved problems and basically started an entirely new paradigm of interational finance is part of its massive value. There are so many things I have  left out, but it should already be apparent that just "copying bitcoin's code or better" will no get you very far. So many dorks have forked and yet their shitcoins are just that: shit. Don't be a fool and think bitcoin has only a price and no value. It's infinitely cooler than that. You owe it to yourself to learn about this stuff. Throw away your preconceived notions and keep an open mind. Bitcoin is ready to blow it out of your fucking head.

Hi cmckay!   
I understand that bitcoin can be daunting. It is a technology that has never existed before and there are many moving parts. However, the power of bitcoin is in being able to properly own and control your money. In order to safely participate you need to fully educate yourself on all of the different aspects of bitcoin. You need to really wrap your brain around how it all works so that you can avoid getting scammed or losing your money due to silly mistakes. Your safety is solely in your hands. 
The side-bar is a great resource. Beyond that, google should be able to find answers to the majority of your questions. If you have more specific questions, post them here and the many helpful folks of r/bitcoin will be more than happy to assist you. 
Bitcoin empowers the individual. Do not let your fears cause you to put your trust in third parties. You are your own bank. You control your own finances. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:20:52
You're spewing nonsense again.

B2B is where I can really see bitcoin making waves in the near future. If suppliers start accepting it en masse, many businesses will not have to convert to fiat just to operate. It will be glorious. So don't get down because merchant adoption is trumping consumer. Merchants can realize more immediate benefits from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:20:14
You are correct. Removing the fungibility of bitcoin is not worth talking about.

It's because bitcoin is brand new technology and thus will necessarily be quite volatile. The true value of a bitcoin will continue to remain volatile until the market grows and obtains more economic inertia. 
Claiming bitcoin's volatility is bad is like claiming a pizza straight out of the oven is too hot. Just wait for it too cool down, and then you can enjoy your delicious pie.

But with a car the ownership is separate from the ability to use it. A screwdriver and some time give me the ability to use a car, so what? The ownership is entirely separate from the ability to use it. With bitcoin, the ownership and the ability to use it are both granted by the private key. I'm not trying to say that stealing someones private key is okay, just that the car/key analogy does not work for bitcoin.

Firstly, what is the difference between chargebacks and fraud protection?
Regardless, I would say that chargebacks are a detriment to the payment system. It is only possible when you do not really "own" your money. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:16:24
You go to sellers who have built up a reputation. Or, you can take your chances with an unknown seller and if you get burned, you only get burned once and can now warn everyone else. Just like in the real world (this is the real world afterall right?) reputation and trust can be built up.
Think about how well the silkroad functioned. That was a (is?) decentralized, anonymous marketplace selling perhaps one of the most sketchy products (drugs, amongst other things). It seemed to work just fine. Most people realize that playing nice gets you more in the end than trying to abuse people/the system. Everyone else is just a silly goose.

Maybe they're biased against coinbase? I have heard on numerous occasions that Coinbase takes forever to "send" transactions, but have never experienced it myself.

Well said and an excellent point. The car/key analogy is still poor. If I drop 20 bucks on the street and forget about it, then someone later finds it and decides to pop it in their wallet, I'm not going to consider them immoral or unethical because of that. It's the same thing with the private keys. If you accidentally let your private keys out, you have effectively dropped your money on the floor.

You don't understand how coinbase works. Coinbase uses off blockchain transactions. So they have a range of receiving addresses, and a range of hot wallet addresses. Thus, the address you send coin to has no bearing on the address that coinbase will send coins from. So anyone other than coinbase will have a lot of trouble connecting the two. If you create a coinbase account with minimal personal info (read: none), then even if they associate the specific in/out traffic with your cb account, that's all they got. 
Also, coinbase is not an ideal laundering method. I just wanted to illustrate how simple it can be. Using satoshidice or some other gambling site may be preferrable. 
Please, I beg you to become more informed about these topics before you start spouting off. You bring down the quality of this subreddit and the bitcoin community as a whole. I applaud you for asking questions, but be less malicious and more open-minded. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 13:58:12
I was thinking this exact same thing! 
Businesses adopting bitcoin en masse may drive the price down as they convert, but what if they didn't have to? 
Bitcoin has a lot more to offer to businesses than it does to consumers (at least for the time being). If businesses could reliably purchase their needed supplies with bitcoin, from other bitcoin accepting businesses, there would be no incentive to convert to fiat, which would eliminate the "downward force". 
So to all those complaining that business adoption is outpacing consumer adoption, don't worry! Right now, the network effect is stronger between businesses than from consumer to business, or between consumers.

This is really a non issue. Data storage capacities and internet bandwidth are increasing each day.

What about some sort of live action donation system. We pick an athlete and set up a website capable of accepting btc. Whenever the athlete performs admirably people are encouraged to donate a tiny amount. That way the athlete would get live feedback from their fans based on how they perform. Heck it could be for anything really. But something happening live would certainly spur some fanfare. 
Don't beat me up too much about the specifics of what I just wrote. Its more of a mind dump. So yeah, it stinks haha.

Absolutely. The price of bitcoin is highly manipulated. This is clearly evident in its extreme short-term volatility. 
But consider two things: 1) bitcoin (the protocal, the idea) is rock fucking solid, and 2) the long-term upward trend (seemingly logarithmic or whatever) in price. 
These two things preserve my faith in bitcoin.

I consider it a waste of time but I just signed it anyhow. To the moon! 
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:38:52
You dont want to go to the moon on an untested, rickety rocket do you? Going to the moon is a big undertaking. Taking it slowly is part of doing it right. Bitcoin wants to replace government issued currency. The inherent difficulty in such an action is so massive it's hard to comprehend. 
An ideal endgame would mean that the entire basis for how society functions will be completely different. How business and politics operate will be unlike anything we have currently. True anonymity, accurate global democracy, the complete homogenization of governing and governed, effortless transfer and storage of wealth, a resilient and immutable store of information, and countless other advancements will come about from the very modest concepts behind bitcoin. 
Such a paradigm shifting idea takes a while to be accepted en mass. People need time to double check all the wiring, and make sure the design can withstand the g-forces. The average person likes to play it safe and only wants to jump on something that's been well tested, and has a proven track record. This is fair, and to be expected. 
But of course, as always there are those special individuals who decide that they aren't going to wait. They want to fly now, before everyone else. So they figure it out the hard way. More often than not they launch with what is probably less than ideal equipment. Now if the idea's good, and the math is sound, they tend to make it. They get to touch the moon before anyone else. Eventually everyone will catch up, but they didn't pave the way they just followed along. And there's no harm in that. If the idea's good, they'd be silly not to join in on the fun. 
Don't be in such a hurry to get to the moon. If the math is sound, everyone will get there eventually. Though I do suppose there is some fun in trying to get there first. :)

Value: the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something.  
Notice the words 'importance' and 'usefulness'. The value of bitcoin is not in lockstep with its current price. It can be undervalued and over valued. However, that fluctuating valuation is separate from its actual worth. Bitcoin does things, certain things that nothing else can do. Don't get fooled by short term price fluctuations. Bitcoin is a game changer.

USD)** and sorts them from highest to lowest balance. This eliminates millions of addresses from places like Satoshi
Dice that have small amounts of bitcoin in them, called ‘dust’. We then save these addresses, along with their balances,
and an alternative representation of the address known as a hash160.1
This seems ridiculous and arbitrary. The value of bitcoin in USD is meaningless, and I'd imagine in the future people would want the snapshot to include those transactions previously thought of as "dust".

Yes, hiding the messy details is convenient and desireable for regular operation. However, when something goes wrong, understanding the inner workings on a low level can help you to diagnose and/or fix the problem. 
For instance, being able to accurately create a bug report (software), or describe your car troubles to your mechanic are very useful skills to have even if you aren't a hardcore DIY type of person. 
With this mindset, everyone becomes a more valuable part of society and our average "savvy-ness" (be it cars, technology, health, etc.) increases. We actually make the world a better place.

The problem is, for people in the first world bitcoin really doesnt have that much to offer "physically". The cool part of bitcoin for people in developed areas is (at least for me) primarily idealistic or often, opportunistic (investing). For someone with first-world banking, bitcoin doesn't really improve all that much, and tends to remove "protections" that people have become quite fond of. 
Regardless, the principles behind bitcoin (things like being your own bank, true ownership of a fixed global currency, and having no central authority, to name a few) are unstoppable. 
In 2008 the paradigm shifting implementation of these ideals, called bitcoin, was let loose in the wild. For 6 years it has been tempered against all the worst attacks this world can throw at it. See, bitcoin can be "money" and money drives the worst out of people. It's been nearly 6 years and bitcoin isn't doing too shabby. So, I think it's safe to say that it really has a fair shot at this thing. Though this "thing" is huge and it's going to take a while. Bitcoin doesnt need fanatics, it needs reasonable people working to improve the world we all live in. It needs people who plant trees whose shade they wont get to stand in. 
I believe that if the core of the bitcoin protocol can be developed to be as simple and reliable as possible, systems can be built on top of it that would allow us to completely revolutionize the world in which everyone of us lives in. The internet did it for information. Bitcoin could do it for life.

* Distribute the btc by relating a pub/priv key pair to each student in the MIT student database (or however they have it set up, I'm sure it's smart). 
* Equally distribute btc among those addresses. 
* Then, let them access that key pair with their typical student credentials, as well as giving them a BTC primer (if they want one), including how (and why it is important) to move the bitcoin to a new address of their own.

I agree. 
I also believe people can see beyond just the value of bitcoin and realize what other benefits it can usher forth. Then they may see the rationale for buying in now to get the whole thing going.
We need adoption. Price fluctuations hamper adoption. Stable price relies on adoption. So we need something else to drive adoption other than stable price. I believe enough "average Joe" consumers can see the other benefits bitcoin offers and be convinced to buy in while ignoring the price fluctuations. The lack of bitcoin adoption is due to its volatility but more due to the lack of education. Many people are hardly computer literate, being "bitcoin literate" is even tougher.

Cygnus_X, you are actually making a very good argument. 
With the current US fiat you are permanently in a "Gox" situation, where you're money is only an IOU and your trust is in a third party. 
What you are suggesting is that with bitcoin, you never have to relinquish "control" of your coin and thus can track it's progress to a certain extent. Yes, the further away it gets from when you signed it over to a third party, the harder it becomes to follow. But as you say, it only takes a hint of foul play to trigger a reaction. 
MyDiddyK, you are failing to realize the distinction between how bitcoin functions vs. how fiat currencies function. And yes, through bad practices you can effectively cause bitcoin to behave much like fiat. Though you are somewhat right that bad internal accounting can result in problems, but why would you trust an organization that isn't transparent and does not do on-blockchain, publicly auditable accounting? The only reason to do that would be to conceal finances.

A system to exchange an effectively infinite amount of tokens would be trivial to create, but the tokens themselves would be worthless. The more tokens there are, the less each is worth. If you have a currency, and there is some, arguably arbitrary way that exists to increase the number of currency units in the system, the currency as a whole is worth less. When more dollars are created, your dollars lose value, however, when something like bitcoin is subdivided further, no one loses value.

Okay, so you don't like Core much, would rather a hard fork, and think any other options besides Cores' for fixing the current primary problems with bitcoin are better. That's fair. Can't argue with you on that. 
However, you described a network. A network that is composed of many different clients with subtle, possibly fatal, differences in consensus logic. Then, then you want to load that network down with every single peanut purchased the world around. I don't think that is feasible.
LN, centralized bitcoin backed payment services, and other semi-centralized/federated/what-have-you solutions are the only realistic option for massive transaction throughput. Big ticket items and long term savings are on the main blockchain. The main chain will be a big deal eventually. Also eventually we need to build a network with effectively infinite velocity, all backed by the "power of the main chain". In the meanwhile, the value of bitcoin has to be protected. If the bitcoin project were to fail, it would be a very big setback for widespread adoption of cryptocurrency. Hard fork vs soft fork is a very political matter, more so than a technical one.

Truly infinite and practically infinite are two very different things. If the money supply has no upper bound, it's value will eventually reach effectively zero.

First off, that's not too bad a deal. Especially since unlike WU, with bitcoin you could do it, instantly, privately, securely and directly.

You cant separate the currency and the chain. The more useful and successful apps that are built on top of the blockchain, the more value btc will gain as you need btc to use tech built on the blockchain.

First, there is nothing wrong with having to wait for a seller to send goods to you. This is inherent part of the process. 
So, in order for online transactions to work, you need to have established a system of trust between the seller and the buyer. Without escrow or charge-back ability, you have to have some assurance that the seller is honest and will send the goods upon receiving the payment. A basic, unbiased review system would likely be sufficient in weeding out dishonest sellers. But, there are a variety of ways to establish a trusted vendor network. 
Lastly, if you have to worry about the site being hacked before your transaction is confirmed (not a very long time at all) and the seller sending your merchandise, why are you trusting the site in the first place? You have to do your own research about every aspect of your online transactions. The impetus is on you, as a consumer (or vendor) to ensure that your transactions are secure and effective. This environment breeds a more informed consumer and naturally, a more informed vendor. Which, on the whole raises the effectiveness and safety of the global currency system. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:57:46
What's your point? Yes fees increase if more people want to send transactions simultaneously. That's exactly how the system should work... do you want some sort of artificial ceiling on transaction fees or something?

People would listen to the vehemently anti-bitcoin people if they had reasonable arguments and didn't just spout off nonsense. The only people bringing up reasonable concerns or quarrels with bitcoin are not the die-hard buttcoiners, who are incapable of having a civil debate about bitcoin, but are in fact people who have taken the time to research bitcoin and to really understand it. Those people do not get labelled as trolls, or downvoted to oblivion or anything else of that nature. If you give respect, you get respect.

Me too. I was vehemently against the roadmap that the Core developers laid out as far as blocksize. I was also very much against the notion of a lightning network for "coffee" transactions. However, after much reading and lots of internal dialogue I have come back over to the ideals that the Core devs believe in, and that the lightning network is really an ideal decentralized way forward to get everyone on the blockchain.
As a side note, I think companies like Bitpay and Coinbase are against lightning network because it basically takes their entire function as a company and turns it into a decentralized protocol layer on top of Bitcoin. They don't like it because it replaces them.

This is indeed a critical time for bitcoin. That is precisely why we should be careful and not break it. Businesses and peers need to realize that the blockchain is a limited and extremely valuable resource. If they keep getting fooled by artificially low fees then they will really be in a bad place when we inevitably come up against the limits of raising the blocksize. We need to think longterm and code for the future. Stopgap solutions and kicking the can down the road are pointless.

I don't believe in giving in to the malicious miners power grab. Segwit is the compromise. Raising the blocksize just further concentrates power where we don't want it. I think the fork is preferable. But it's not going to happen.

Not really. 
Check out UTF-8 vs UTF-32. UTF-8 is far more complicated than UTF-32 yet there are a multitude of good reasons to take the extra implementation complexity inherent in UTF-8 to gain the effeciency and compatibility over UTF-32. 
The blockize increase vs segwit it like that. Raising the blocksize is simple but gets you very little. Segwit is a bit more complex but you get massive gains. It's a no brainer. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:47:08
You hit the nail on the head here. The vitriol for the core developers is unfounded.
However, their seemingly odd silence on any plans for increasing the blocksize are what draws most of the ire. If the core team simply stated that "yes, we will upgrade the blocksize when it becomes actually necessary (read: not yet)" then they would catch a lot less flak. From everything I have seen this is basically the sentiment I get from the core team. 
AFAIK though they have not explicitly stated something along those lines.They may feel it is not necessary to comment on the issue, but when lots of casual users believe the sky is falling, you can at least tell them that it is not. Maybe even provide some examples. Then again, maybe these responses do exist and I just have not seen them. Or perhaps the core devs are devs and not PR people, so you get this sloppy communication which makes casual users antsy. 
From everthing I have gather it seems that we are here:
People believe the sky is falling because blocks are getting closer to capacity. However, no disasters occur if blocks fill up and a fee market develops. If transaction fees increase a little bit, that's not a horrible situation. 
Raising the blocksize limit, taking primary dev responsibility from the core team, attempts to fork the blockchain are all comparatively very risky moves. They could pay off, but they could also destroy bitcoin as we know it, in all its variations. 
Soft forks (technology refinements) are safer and can help improve the quality of the core protocol. They pose little risk to the stability of the network and allow for benefits to the network that compound as the network grows. These are good things (in general) and are safe. 
So, some people want to play it hard and fast with the bitcoin project and others want to take a very cautious, thought out approach. I tend to agree with the latter group. You can build all the crazy shit you want on top of bitcoin, to enable any kind of weird stuff you think is useful and it wont hurt the core protocol no matter how many bugs, tricks or faults you create. But, if you damage the core protocol, everything is at risk of demise. One tiny bug introduced in the core protocol could cause potentially fatal amounts of damage to bitcoin. 
TL;DR: Be careful what you wish for. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 01:26:13


Ideally, the bitcoin protocol will be used indefinitely from this point in time forward.
Hopefully, bitcoin will get used more and more until everyone is using it.  


No, definitely not. Just how currently not everyone is instantly using bitcoin despite how friggin, indisputably awesome it is. On boarding takes time. Especially with something as paradigm shifting and brain-exploding as bitcoin. 


This bitcoin "road" you speak of is not currently full as far as I know. There are empty blocks, undersized blocks and still, anyone can freely transact on the blockchain for a reasonable fee and usually, almost instantly. Your post has this air about it like immediate action must be taken, or else... dun dun dun. 
The internet is kind of sucky the world around. I don't know why, but I think it's because the internet (like bitcoin) scares some ~~overlords~~people. Some places get it right and hook everyone up with fat pipes, but even in a "first holed" country like Canada's Face, people still have terrible internet connectivity and outrageously priced and limited internet options in a lot of places. Slowly, over time this will get better (ideally) and slowly, over time is how we should increase the blocksize. 
Increasing the blocksize is an inelegant solution. Sure, if the sky were falling, it would absolutely be an easily agreeable bandaid and everyone would hard fork bitcoin until it worked again. But right now, forking is reckless. There is no immediate need to do it. Seg wit and other shit will benefit in the short term, but more importantly, they benefit massively in the long term. They are improvements to the core code, that only require soft lovin', allow people more choice in the near term, and ultimately help everyone with minimal damage. 
Yes, the blocksize is a super simple fix. But it is dangerous. Right now, we still have time to work on the real elegant stuff, optimize the heck out of every bit (bit bang it so you dont have to fork it?) and it is these optimizations that will allow us to reach the massive transaction levels everyone drools about. 
One of the core ideas of bitcoin is that it is decentralized. Without a head, without a heart, it cannot succumb to any single threat. All that Antonopoulous talk about anti-fragility doesn't just sound awesome, but is one of the revolutionary things that makes bitcoin different than anything that came before it. 
Bitcoin is not just a new currency. It is not a store of value. It most definitely is not a replacement for VISA. Bitcoin is a completely revolutionary concept. Say the internet represents free transfer of information. Bitcoin represents the free transfer of trust. Or something to that effect. 
TL;DR: Don't break the protocol. Don't break the protocol. Don't break the protocol. 
NOTE: This is all just my bs opinion from whatever I have gathered through my biased ears, arse and eyeballs. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:12:20
I'd say that's a good general take on it. I was getting to the fact that people will always need a bunch of other tangentially related questions answered and you have to be able to handle those. Bitcoin can be very offensive to people's idea of money, information and value... it can be hard for them to hear that they don't really understand these things. 
Like, what would you say if someone asked you what money is? Or if they say bitcorn has no intrinsic value? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:40:47
Lightning, schnorr, segwit and what have you are solutions to problems. Raising the blocksize, however, is a problem. It's a problem we may have to face in the future (ideally not) but it's a problem none the less.

Who gives a frack what Toshi suggested? We have the code they wrote. Thats what mattered. Until ole' Toshi writes something new that allows us to do microtransactions on the main chain in reality then who cares what he thought would be true. The sheer amount of improvements that have been made to the original client is astounding. Satoshi is probably so happy that people took their idea and ran with it. People that really have the chops to take it all the way through. 
EDIT: Also, segwit will improve transactions on the main chain which is a small step back in the direction of viable main chain micropayments. Its a good step forward.

Bitcoin is not that hard to use. It's like saying driving is too hard for people because there is too much to be responsible for. It isn't hard and as soon as people decide bitcoin is something they want to be a part of, they will figure it out no problem. 
The "problem" currently, is that a large majority of people just do not care about bitcoin.

Well if miners believe that bitcoin price will always trend upwards then it does make sense for them to grab as much coin now as they can. However that doesn't make sense, since if massive adoption occurs the fees they wI'll see will increase massively as well. I really can only conclude that they want power and central control over bitcoin. No other conclusion adds up. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:32:47
I'll assume this is a genuine question.  
Nearly no one thinks that the blocksize can remain the same forever. The majority of people believe it should increase. There are different opinions about how much and how fast. What cannot be disagreed with is the fact that you cannot increase the blocksize enough to ever get massive transaction throughput. It's just impossible. There are however, achievable ways to increase transaction capacity. Lots of technology is being built to do just that.  
Increasing the blocksize is necessary, the debate is just about when and how much.  
I, personally, favor the conservative approach. Take it real slow and give lots of time for the changes to propagate. Bitcoin is getting more valuable with each passing minute. Being careless about the way forward is a sure way to trip over a rock and die.
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:18:52
Breaking up bitcoin into many little camps is a good approach to killing it. Perhaps all of this noise is an attempt to ruin bitcoin from within. Technologically it is pretty sound, but dividing the people that use it could prove to be a viable attack. 
I agree that blocksize will eventually need to be increased, but hard fork, consensus protocol changes are exceptionally dangerous. They should not be approached without the utmost care and attention. The current state of the big-blockers camp does not come across as reasonable and cautious. The golden rule is: Whatever else you do, don't break the fucking protocol.

Why are you fine with being so wrong? It's not that simple and is not a real scaling solution. You can only put bigger tires on your car up until the point where they don't fit in the wheel wells anymore. At that point you need a real scaling solution. Segwit elegantly makes the car bigger and enables for easier future scaling. It's a good path forward.

Very excellent point. Though if bitcoin "just works^TM" for everyone who wants to use it, the common perception of bitcoin wont matter much. 


Their next big thing cannot ever be bitcoin. "They" don't want bitcoin. Bitcoin is more than money, it is more than value transfer, more than a public, distributed ledger, more than a decentralized network designed to run best when all the participants are selfish. It represents a very significant possibility of a shift in the status quo. The very hierarchy of society could be reorganized around the "basic" potential offered by bitcoin. Buying stuff online, remittance and micro payments are just the start. There may come a time when people don't understand why anyone would have ever used fiat currency; when encryption, privacy and the true power of open information are the layman's everyday. That would be a beautiful world to live in.

I'm not against raising the blocksize. I believe every possible optimization should be made prior to upping it. If we could get away with never raising that would be ideal, though very unlikely. Bitcoin is still pretty tiny. The blocksize does not need to be increased right now. Seqwit, start building out the second layer solutions, get organic growth to occur and then possibly up the blocksize if it's the bottleneck. Seems reasonable to me. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 23:46:05


I dont know where you've been but I believe that is true right now.

@_date: 2016-01-31 02:32:35
But then you have a limit that will exclude many people who are too "poor" to be able to lockup a massive amount of BTC just to run a node. 
Then, the people who are reaping a prize for running nodes can afford to start more nodes and gain even more of the prizes. In this way the nodes will all be run by whoever can get the most nodes setup the fastest. The reason this doesn't occur with mining is because mining is relatively "hard". The costs of spooling up a node are relatively tiny comparatively. 
I think this may have the opposite effect. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:18:48

Yeah but if your full node uses an unacceptable amount of bandwidth, you'd want to turn it off. If it uses less, you might be fine with having it run in the background. You can only saturate your connection so much at one time. The balance is the whole incentives - disincentives = peoples willingness to do it.

FWIW, I moved from big block camp to small block after diving into the more technical details of block size/propagation/decentralization, scaling bitcoin and realistic network/hardware limitations. My understanding is that bitcoin strikes a very fine balance between many different factors. This balance is delicate and any large jolts in a given direction can cause the whole blockchain to topple over.

Of course. So you do agree that lowering the disincentives can increase the overall incentive. But yes, you have to have some sort of incentives (even small) or it would just be stuck at neutral. 


It cannot create net incentives, but it can increase them by not taking away from already present incentives. The result is the same, regardless of how we waltz around the semantics.

All of your questions have really easy answers. Answers that can be found simply by even half heartedly following the history of bitcoin. 


Look what happened last time any pool got above 51.

Also I disagree with your point here:


People exchange money for things all the time. They typically "lose money" on those exchanges but gain something else like entertainment, leisure, new toys or whatever else. People can conclude that the economic cost of running a full node is worth it for things that it provides. If you don't believe the things bitcoin offers are worthwhile, then you are right, why use bitcoin? 
If you can reduce any disincentives (like bandwidth usage), then the offerings that bitcoin has are more likely to convince people to use it.

Bitcoin is very useful and more and more people realize it every day. I'm still curious about the Satoshi coins. They're the only unpredictable factor in this whole house of cards. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:57:24
I didn't claim that "reducing disincentives" == "increasing incentives" though. I just said both independently can make it more likely for people to run full nodes.

I think most people mean "practical value" when they say intrinsic value. We can all agree certain things have practical value. Or maybe call it universal value. There is probably a proper term for it.

Why not?
@_date: 2016-06-05 13:06:05
Bitcoins value goes up and if you are holding it you get "wealthier". No need to convert the coin to another currency just to realize it's value.

Yeah payment protocol is neat. But how are addresses unsafe? 
@_date: 2016-06-11 20:43:12
I just don't get your point and why you are so vocal about it. You're basically saying "if more people have marbles, then more people will potentially get robbed of them". Yeah, that is true, but it is also painfully obvious. 
Why make so much commotion about such an apparent conclusion?
 Also, you are right. Apparently you are right about many things. I'm simply failing to see why this particular point merits so much fanfare.
Edit: also you said "their money used to be safe". My point about fiat was that it is not their money. With bitcoin, although it can be stolen, it is at least actually "their money".
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:55:51
That is obviously what you want to do, so just do that. Don't use those services that convert your direct deposit to bitcoin. Just buy the btc yourself. Make sure not to leave your coins on an exchange or online wallet. Transfer them to your own wallet and you will ensure they're yours for the next 10 years.
@_date: 2016-06-03 14:33:20
But the payment protocol is also vulnerable to mitm attacks as well as malicious software that can change payment fields, no? Also how does the PP handle distributed cert authentication? I didn't see anything about that in the BIP. Also, at the end of the day the wallet still sends a regular bitcoin transaction which is susceptible to manipulation. Payment protocol is cool but it does not help if someone else is playing on your computer. As for making sure you pay to the right place, a little bit of legwork goes a long way towards ensuring the address(s) are correct. PP is convenient for sure, but, as i see it, calling addresses unsafe seems disingenuous. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:14:04
Stop this. Blocksize debate is not that simple and you know it. Changing "a simple constant" has far reaching effects on bitcoin as a whole and is anything but simple. Also, changing that constant does nothing significant for scaling.

Mining could help offset the costs of heating your home. Especially if the price of BTC continues to increase. However, unless you can retrofit your house on your own, I think the initial install costs, equipment and electricity would prevent you from ever profiting.

BIP 75 is about adding identity certification to the payment protocol. I don't think that will seriously affect user adoption at this point in time. Certainly not more than other improvements. I have a friend. I explained bitcoin to them. I don't really get your point about your friend mining a long time ago. Even satoshi knew gpu mining would be very quickly left in the dust.

I don't get it. That 10USD has diminished purchasing power 500 years later. At year zero it purchased 2.5 chickens and at year 500 it can purchase say .65 chickens. That's a reduction in buying power due to inflation (though the magnitude I suggest is not accurate for US inflation).  
So, if the value of BTC stayed absolutely in line with USD over a time period, because of inflation, that same BTC would represent more USD. All things the same, USD actively devalues when compared to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:15:57
Then rapidly back up to 25!

@_date: 2017-01-30 16:21:29
That's true of anything though, right? The learned can take advantage of new tech, while laymen cannot... kind of how it works. 
It's like saying at first that the Internet was too complicated for average people to use. It still is. It's just that now there are layers on top of the Internet that allow less expert people to use it. They still don't understand how the Internet really works, but for them it has been abstracted away to the point where they really don't need to. But likewise, there are lots more people who do fully understand the Internet than compared to when it first emerged. I think that far enough in the future, most people will have no need to understand the nuts and bolts of the bitcoin network. They won't need to. But overall there will be more bitcoin experts than today (though they will still be a tiny fraction of the majority).
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:35:45
Just raising the limit will never get us to VISA scale. Ever. Raising the blocksize limit beyond a certain, not very high, amount will destroy decentralization, one of bitcoin's most important characteristics. So yea, we can increase transactions some tiny amount and simultaneously remove one of the best features of bitcoin. I don't think that sounds like a good idea. Raise the blocksize when the whole network can actually handle the increased load. What you are suggesting is to take the governor off an engine that can't handle higher speeds. The engine will go faster for a moment, and then blow up.

What does that even mean? Is this a book, or a song? Perhaps a short film? What the fork do we care about overtones for?  
Bitcoin is designed to operate despite the shortcomings of human behavoir. Developers kowtowing to populist ideas is the end of bitcoin.  
The point is that bitcoin really only needs to do one thing to pan out: remain stable. Forking the blocksize "just because" is the antithesis of that goal.

Constantly facing insults and resistance to even discussing these things must be draining. Thanks for sticking it out! I cannot fathom why people would not want to talk about these things. Money is one of the most important things in everyone's lives and yet no one wants to talk about it or take any time to understand it. It a sad state of affairs.

You cannot downplay how immediately useful it is to have that ability. It gives bitcoin a real utility, right now. It gives bitcoin value.  
Other things like smart contracts, dapps, and all the cool stuff enabled by bitcoin are still in their infancy. The forex, settlement currency aspect of bitcoin is currently a major factor in its value. 
Bitcoin has much more potential that just "relatively cheap cross-border transactions", but those are currently something that makes bitcoin very attractive. Even better, its an aspect of bitcoin that doesnt undermine the basic concepts that make bitcoin different and give it its real value and revolutionary nature. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:12:42

For the average nobody, sure. But with a fair amount of insider information you can definitely get a leg up on the "rest of the market". As with all things, imperfect information is why the price has to be discovered, and it's what prevents the price from just immediately lock-stepping into perfect equilibrium.

It definitely is. I was being sarcastic.

The specific valuation is not as important as how secure the currency is seen as. More secure and stable means more confidence and more confidence means more people holding it.

I did comment on that further. I figured that by the time bitcoin is in the millions of USD per coin value, "dumping" the bitcoins wouldn't even make sense, right? Why trade bitcoin (which by then would be the "gold" standard of currency) for any type of fiat scrip? 
Yes, I do think institutional investors take the dump threat seriously and I wanted to see if that concern could be alleviated by reasoning through the scenarios.

Though, one comforting thought for those crazy gamblers: anyone who has bought and held indefinitely has always had increased returns.

Perhaps for someone who can only barely figure out coinbase, addresses are too difficult. But for anyone actually using bitcoin they don't seem to be too big of a point of contention.

Lets break down their comment.  


What does deserve mean in this context? The value of bitcoin is found naturally by the market. In that sense I would say it "deserves" whatever market cap it is at.  


Should gold be less valuable by the same virtue? No, probably not. 
The whole comment is just malignant.  
It's like saying at the advent of electricity: "then electricity doesn't deserve a high market value because it's only used by a few people currently" because it is a new technology that is rapidly developing. Pure inanity.

Yeah, kind of. How much expertise can be behind your opinion if you have little to no knowledge of the matter at hand? Spreading uninformed opinions can be detrimental.
This subject is not just that of desire or want, there are technical matters that need to be thought of as well as the political issues. 
The block size is an easy to latch on to point of argument (or contention) but it is an immensely complicated issue and it really doesn't matter what some group (or individuals) "want". All that matters is code and testing that code. If you can make bitcoin deliver 1 bajillion TPS at no detriment to the fundamentals, then by all means let see that magic spell Mr. wizard. 
Otherwise, go ahead and keep voicing your opinion. No harm in that! But dont delude yourself into thinking you're doing any good. Especially if you don't understand the nuances of the issues, you may be doing more harm than not.

Just because something isn't as likely to occur doesn't mean it's not good to be unprepared for it.  
Additionally there are ways to transact offline. That's one of the cool parts of the Bitcoin protocol: it doesn't actually care if you are online, or on a computer even. Those just make it way more convenient.

Haha, wut?

There may be good reason to make it smaller. But for now, 1mb is a known quantity and all our data is based on it. Why venture into the unknown (with unknown repercussions)? Bitcoin is working great. What's the rush to try and break it?  
 If you like the "move fast and break things" approach, ETH welcomes you with open arms. They love that approach. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:34:56
Yeah thats my understanding. The block is counted differently but they're the same size. What it does help is shrink the UTXO size which is nice! So you can have lots more transactions in the same size UTXO pool.

They can. But they can also just be shills. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 22:33:20
Because what makes bitcoin valuable is hard for a majority of people to understand. It is worth 12 billion and barely anyone uses it and even fewer actually understand it well (myself not included in that group haha). Imagine it's market cap once it hits prime time and everyone sees how revolutionary it is. Or more likely, when applications are developed that leverage the incredible power of a decentralized currency. Bitcoin is one of, if not the single most important inventions of recent history.

@_date: 2016-11-03 00:03:03
The problem lies in how one defines ownership. In bitcoin, ownership is traditionally possession of the private key. In that sense, if someone could somehow miraculously come up with a private key for a funded address, then those coins would belong to them.

They really arent.  
You are saying that it is just as important to store, forever, duplicated across thousands or (ideally) millions of nodes, every single can of pringles purchased, than, say, every transaction that transfers the ownership of a house. If that is what you mean when you say that "day to day" purchases are just as important as "large amounts" then I disagree.  
No matter how you cut it, whatever faction, or side you're on, you must agree that main chain (on chain) transactions are not, and can never be unlimited. They are by definition scarce. I would personally prefer that insurmountable level of security for something a bit more important than a grande latte.

The ATH counts. I'm not saying it doesn't count. By the definition of ATH, it was obviously 1k plus. What I'm saying is that is was very briefly there and reached that high suspiciously  (gox and willybot), so the current price is actually much "higher" than it would appear. The next bubble (if it happens) will severly eclipse the previous ATH.

Isn't that the point of forums like this? People can discuss the complexities and nuances of the network without being forced through a single lens.  
If you have a site that takes facts and interprets (translates) them into more accessible language there will necessarily be tradeoffs between accuracy and ease-of-understanding, but more importantly there will be biases. 
 The raw network data has no biases and always tell the full story.
@_date: 2016-11-19 17:41:38
Very good point. That's why it seems to me that big blockers who want a hard fork are doing it for other reasons than increased throughput. One reason could be to gain control of the protocol. If the big blockers only wanted more throughput they could work with the biggest dev community, come up with good code and make it happen. But instead they spew vitriol, misinformation and attempt to poison the well. It's nasty.

Its that there exists an alternate way to get blocks even if your connection to the Internet is down or nonexistent. Redundancy is the key to a resilient network. This download-only satellite is a great step towards strengthening bitcoin.

The funny thing is that little story applies to countless more situations than just the subprime mortgage crisis.

You're missing my point. OP was suggesting that it should be compared to some adjusted value in USD. It shouldn't.

Perhaps they are intelligent and realized that they dont want to operate on L1, the blockchain, since their service (customer safeguards and conveniences) makes more sense on L2 of bitcoin, the p2p coffee currency level. Maybe they dont need to deal with bitcoin directly and are going to pivot into the market they actually want to deal in. They could provide services like insurance, fraud detection/prevention, deals/promos, escrow, interest and other things using a coffee currency they offer that is powered by bitcoin. The user get a nicer experience, circle makes money and provides a unique service and acts as a libre bank. Perhaps they will get into the LN game when and if they becomes a thing.

Being difficult to fork is a pillar upon which bitcoin's stability lies. Forking all over makes everyone lose confidence in your crypto and then it goes the way of the dodo. The fact that segwit is taking time to activate shos that bitcoin has a healthy, diverse set of participants who all have to participate to reach strong concensus. I'm glad bitcoin doesnt have a butalik that could force segwit down everyone's throats. Fork smart! 
@_date: 2016-12-13 13:10:48

From what I do know about bitcoin and segwit, I am not against segwit. But I do not know enough about the protocol and the specific implementation of segwit to be strongly for or against it. 
If the majority of the network finds consensus that segwit is a benefit, and adopts it, then I am comfortable with upgrading to it based what I do know about segwit and the protocol.

Hardforks are supposedly dangerous. Whether or not they are actually that dangerous is a different debate that I am not well versed in enough to make points either way. Though on the surface it does seem nicer with a soft fork that people can choose if they want the upgrades and if not they are not kicked out of the network. Then again, hard fork when btc is young may be better than later when there is more value on the network and becomes impossible. Technical debt and all.

Lowering the amount in active circulation increases the value of bitcoins. You can send 1 satoshi around and around to do every transaction on earth. That one satoshi would be quite valuable. With a few more you can have higher throughout, but each token is valued less individually.

My store, [Calypso's Combs]( has accepted bitcoin from launch via bitpay. They have been zero hassle and it was super easy to setup.

It's the same concept with gold. Does anyone know exactly how much gold there is out there to the grain? No. It's hard to count every chunk and nugget. But there are many people doing their best to estimate the number. Why? Self interest. They want to know "truly" how much their own gold is worth. How much total gold there is affects that, so they count it as best they can. If a ship full of bullion sinks in a pond full of acid, everyone will likely note that down (maybe someone will try to recover it but that's a different matter). So gold has a value despite there not being an exact count. Same principle applies to bitcoin. People are estimating (now and in the future) how many are out there in total, how much demand there is and how many are available for sale. This informs their decision of how valuable a bitcoin should be. I don't think any of this is theory as it has been shown in multiple other situations.

Banks are predatory. Bitcoin liberates us from the banks and puts the control of money back into the hands of the people.
Some banks charge fees for having too low of a balance. This disproportionately hurts poor people. This is just one of many reasons why banks keep people poor.  
Bitcoin, in contrast, is a level playing field, with no central authority in charge. This means everyone has to succumb to the natural balance of unmolested economics. Poor people will not get poorer using bitcoin. Holding fiat, they get poorer with each passing minute.

Or even if you're just suspicious... the fact stands that it is really scary that we don't own our own money. We just get IOU's for all our hard work.

I guess your general assessment is right, but the way you frame it is pointless.  
"it's too volatile to use, people must use it to make it less volatile". Then you go on to claim that adoption won't happen because of the initial volatility barrier. But that is clearly wrong.  
Look at BTC volatility 5 years ago vs now. It is way down. Volatility is decreasing and adoption is increasing.  
Both things you claim are impossible are actually happening.

Segwit is not comparable to a block size increase for a few reasons. Currently, yes bitcoin could use some scaling because people are cheapskates and dont want to pay for using a technology that solves a previously unsolvable problem and that has the potential to give everyone on earth complete financial freedom (among other awesome things), Segwit acheieves a slight capcacity increase (comparabble to 2mb HF) but without an actual fork. It does this in a slightly obfuscated way with its block weight didgeridoo. On top of that though it makes a very necessary change in how signature data is stored to make the whole protocol more sane. Probably also some other housekeeping things are in there but I dont know. It is a very minor step into the unknown compared to the giant leap that is a block size increase. Again, this is just my understanding.

3.Never trust nobody.   
4.Never get high, on your own supply.   
5.Never sell no coin where you rest at.   
6.That God damn credit, dead it.   
7.Keep your family and business completely seperated.   
8.Never keep no coin on you.   
9.If you ain’t gettin coins stay the fuck from police.   
10.A strong word called consignment,If you ain’t got the clientele say hell no.

I am surprised that I have yet to come across a set of network simulations with various variables tweaked. Heck I'd be willing to help develop some. Anyone know of anything like that? It would be cool to model the different network's that would result. Probably wouldn't be very reliable (only as good as the specifics of the model and likely flawed assumptions), but fun to look at for sure. I remember Gavins stuff, but I think those were more back of the envelope style and not comprehensive simulations, but maybe I just don't remember exactly.

Trying to get rid of the "blockspace issue" or "difficult to determine transaction fees" or "too much confirmation time" may necessitate changes that make bitcoin lose its other unique benefits (decentralization, censorship resistance, etc).

It still is low fee compared to most other methods of wealth transfer, especially given exactly the type of wealth and manner in which it is transacted (own able money and decentralized transfer). However, where did this idea that it should be a practically free coffee currency come from? Please don't just say satoshi. Second layer networks should handle the trifling transactions and bitcoin proper can handle big things like the purchase of a house or a car. Exactly for the reasons that people claim using and securing bitcoin is too hard for the average Joe is why we need a second layer(s) to make it friendly and easy for Joe to use. Then we get massive adoption, no threat to bitcoi cores real value proposition, and easy safe on boarding for non technical people. Bitcoin is the hardcore low level internet, layer two will be AOL or the like. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:46:21

Think one step further. With bitcoin as the back bone of an international monetary network, any regular Joe schmoe can open up an international bank and start offering banking services like insurance and interest gaining accounts. With bitcoin as the bedrock, literally anyone on earth can become a bank with no barrier to entry. That's frigging awesome!

Technically there is no spam on the blockchain. If a transaction gets into a block its legit. 


I believe this is generally what people are doing when they identify "spam" txns. They see a pattern that they deem to be abnormal or "spammy" and call it a spam attack. However, it could just be that someone is doing something that to them is legitimate and to outside observers looks like an attack.  
I am not saying that there are no spam attacks, I am just saying that identifying them for sure is not possible.

I'm just keeping the important distinctions in-tact. You seem to not understand this important difference. Neither of our opinions changes reality.   
Here, let me try to clarify: 1 BTC != 1 BCH.   
The unit of measure for Bitcoin is BITCOINS. The units of measure for BCash is BitcoinCashes. This is pretty basic stuff. If I asked to be paid 1 BTC and recieved 1 BCH, I would not consider that valid payment. No one would! Because they are not the same!

You're running through an ancient list of bitcoin misconceptions. Do more research!  
First point: By taking the power over money from governments you eliminate their ability to manipulate using that power.  
  
Second point: Every transaction is pseudo-anonymous. Without "good old fashioned police work" you cannot relate the TXNs to real identities. Also there is "off-chain" functionality. 
The difference between bitcoin and every other money is at the foundation.

Regulation is not relevent in this discussion. Traditional financial institutions have very small networks that need to coordinate for all users to be synchronized. Its a smaller set of peers that need to be synced. So it is easier and more efficient. It is however not decentralized.   


Bitcoin, having lots of well distributed nodes is less efficient at synchronization. Bitcoin is massively redundant and that makes its inefficient. This inefficiency however is a necessary trade-off to maintain meaningful decentralization. This decentralization is the value that we get for being distributed. Not being more efficient. Efficiency is the trade-off. 


The gains from decentralization are not in efficiency. They are in freedom.

Some people do. But it's just as silly as people who lump, say, all firearms rights issues together. It would be pointlessly general.
Though things are never black and white, you can usually observe a good general direction to head in. Id lean towards fewer regulations than more. Legislation is like a bitmap. At a certain distance it appears to cover every case (appears high resolution), but as you try to apply specific laws to increasingly specific contexts (zooming in) you see that the laws don't necessarily include every odd corner case (appears pixelated, missing information or resolution). This is a general shortcoming of regulations. They hardly can broad enough to cover many situations withot  being so broad as to be useless. Then we get into the whole interpretation of law which introduces yet more uncertainty. Regulation typically causes inefficieny that a functioning free market would not have to bear.

So, since it's inception bitcoins use as a currency and as a store of value has only increased. These increases occurred alongside the increase in fees. Could you not perhaps think that they are related? That perhaps increased usage has also caused increased fees? To me it makes perfect sense and is what always happens when a scarce thing gets more popular. It's very similar to road usage. The problem is of induced demand.  
I don't think that fees are a hinderance, as you put it, but are a natural result of the market finding the correct feerate. Despite your cries of the sky falling, Bitcoin is stronger and more popular today than it ever has been.

Thats fair. I can see that being a factor. But to me, using the same bitcoin logo everywhere builds brand recognition. If I see a different version of the BTC logo everywhere, it doesn't have the same effect as when I see the same exact bitcoin logo used by everyone. The logo being the same confers that the bitcoin behind it is the same and that it is the same "bitcoin" that everyone else is using.

Okay and your points are still false. And I'd argue they interface decently. Considering the entire digital world transact primarily with fiat... yeah it's pretty good at it. The only difference between a banks ledger and the bit coin one is the decentralization.


We will have to agree to disagree on that one. The value of bitcoin is directly proportional to its degree of decentralization. Simple evidence of that is how badly the price tanks everytime there is even a tiny looming threat of unacceptable  centralization on any facet of the network. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:12:46
Of course. That's how the system works! People just use whatever code they feel is best and that is within a reasonable margin of consensus.

Everyone can coexist happily under a system of properly coded peers.

They can change strategies to their advantage without other players changing strategy... Like they currently do with block withholding, AB, blocking protocol upgrades... etc. I don't think miner incentives are yet perfectly balanced against other players. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:33:22


It's the same sitation taken to a further extent. My analogy was to show that AB is indeed a detriment to bitcoin. The incentives for all members of the network need to be properly aligned. AB interferes with that balance and so should be fixed. And the cherry on top is most people just want covert AB fixed... which really just allows us to upgrade the protocol and still allows miners to cheat. Jihan just doesn't want to admit to using it.

AB does too just to a lesser extent. It biases towards AB miners. Change my example to "solve blocks with one millionth the time of the fastest normal ASIC" and there is still a distribution, just extremely tilted toward the "cheating" miners. However it would just look like those miners have massively more hash power than they do... so perhaps you're right, it's not the real problem. But from my point of view, generating more PoW by doing less of the work is a threat to the incentive balance. Though if everyone could do it it would be moot... so yeah I see what youre saying about the patent being the primary issue (along with the protocol upgrade blocking).

If bitcoin relies on the good will of every single participant, it is doomed. I do not disagree with your view.

Why do you treat satoshi like an infallible god? He had a good idea and made a decent first implementation. Most of his initial visions were speulative and are now outdated.


They are. There are much more up to date analysis of how bitcoin works and how it can actually scale.


Gavins proposal to jump to 20mb would have objectively centralized bitcoin to the point of killing it. It's too much for the network right now.

What is to stop someone from creating a tool that attempts to double spend every transaction you make? Then, even casual users can take advantage of any service accepting zero-conf. I believe there are tools out there that do this already. With or without RBF, people will either accept zero-conf for small amounts or they will not. No one would ever accept zero-conf (RBF or not) for any significant amount. Why does it matter?


Yes, if you explain it incorrectly. Users need to be informed of the technology they are using. The whole "be your own bank" ideology of bitcoin includes informing yourself of what the heck you are doing. 


It lets you know that transactions absolutely can be changed after transmission. Takes away the false zero-conf sense of security. This is true with or without RBF.

Yeah, but the only people using bitcoin now are the early adopters. 
Ever try explaining tcp to someone? Or how BGP protocol works? Super complicated, but still everyday Joe user can leverage the power of the Internet no problem, with zero knowledge of the complex underlying protocols. 
Bitcoin is the underlying protocol for the Internet of money, or whatever you want to call it. Bitcoin will not and need not be understood by everyone. Lightning and other layers built above Bitcoin will facilitate the onboarding of anyone who just wants to be a user and not worry about the protocol level details. In just a few years Bitcoin has gone from obscure cypherpunk tech, to a system that is used globally by millions and many of who are not very technically savy. I see no reason why this "softening" of the bitcoin user experience will not continue until even the most computer illiterate can use it seamlessly. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:59:04


Right and that isn't the problem here.
It's the despicable behavior to boldy lie about using it, stealing the IP (which I personally don't give a carp about), and holding back protocol upgrades under false pretenses. 
Basically it looks like Jihad Bu wanted to gain as much coin as posible before this optimization was eventually patched up. Perhaps Jihad knows that segwit is inevitable and just wants to maximize ROI before it happens. Greedy son of a fuck.

Core is clear on where they believe bitcoin should head. It is hard to expect the core developers to both create and market bitcoin. They can only do one of those effectively at a time. Perhaps, the core devs need some "marketing" focused members, but then that would just seems sketchy in and of itself. They are clear on their intents, motives and ideas if one just takes a bit of time to read what they write. A lot of the big-blockers have been very loud and frankly hostile in their attempt to get core to "sway" on the issue of blocksize. Sometimes there just isn't really a good reason to do something at the current time. 
Though this feels all tired and boring. These arguments have been drawn out waay to far. I just think it is going to be interesting to see how this all develops and where bitcoin ends up in a year or two. In order to bring about the change that bitcoin intended, it will have to prove impervious to attacks on all fronts. Including community bickering over the technical timeline of whatever the most popular protocol is.

No what gives it value is the immutability of the ledger, combined with the coin cap and the decentralized functionality. Break any of those qualities and bitcoin is no longer useful. Transactions fees cannot be "too high" until bitcoin has competition that offer what it does. Currently there is none. And due to network effect and sheer inertia, there is likely to never be any.

We already know that bitcoin is technically superior to gold on all fronts.
It'll just take time for bitcoin's stability and immutability to be proven. Gold has been around a long time and people trust it.
Bitcoin is already more valuable than gold in a technical sense, it just need to be time tested to gain the faith that only long term reliability can bring. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:59:49
There's a lower limit for what transactions cost on the bitcoin network. Whatever that bottom line is, users will have to pay it in order to transact. The only risk is that higher paying users push out lower paying ones. That is not a problem. It is a sign of a healthy network.
Advancements to the protocol will work to push the lower limit down and that is a good thing. But over time, as bitcoin becomes more widespread, the transaction fees will increase. As they say, this is good for bitcoin. 
If another protocol can do what bitcoin does, but cheaper, then yeah everyone will jump ship. However, I don't think that is possible. If it were, it would be implemented in bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-02-07 02:15:15
I don't really see the argument as how much to increase the blocksize. I see it as when to increase the blocksize. Big blockers want an increase "right now". Core supporters feel that there are other optimizations that should be prioritized before increasing at all. Increasing the blocksize will exclude people from being able to support the network. How many people will be excluded is up for debate, but it is definitely non-zero. 
Why rush to increase the blocksize "right now", when there is really no urgent need?

This again. High fees need to be relative to something... what are fees "high" in comparison to?


You're contradicting yourself. You just said decentralization was on a sliding scale and then said you need it to enable the other things you listed... Decentralization may be on a gradient but there is a threshold below which it is no longer counted as being decentralized. It's like a Schmidt trigger. Eventually it hits the threshold and flips from centralized to decentralized primarily. 
The rest of your list is just a bunch of -ilities with no substance. 
Your last statement isn't even true. Fiat currencies check items 2,3,4,5,6 and 8 and yet they are fully centralized...
How do fees hurt acceptability and portability? Users who think bitcoin is for coffee transactions may shy away but people who actually need a global immutable ledger will pay an appropriate amount for the power. Bitcoin main-chain transactions can, by design, never be coffee microtransactions and I'm fine if all the people who thought it could be are scared off. 


They are. But they aren't bitcoin, so what's your point?


Who said cheap hardware? I'd say decentralization is about not writing protocol software that obviously and inevitably leads to centralization (crossing the threshold as mentioned before). So we strive to have efficient code that requires minimal resources. The more resource hungry running a node is, the less people will be able to.

If we simply raise the blocksize this same exact scenario will play out. And then we raise it again and yet again, the blocks fill up. 
There is a infinite demand for blockspace. Raising the blocksize is not a solution, it is a necessary evil. We should do everything we can do improve the efficiency of the protocol before going down the slippery slope of raising the blocksize. 
Segwit has no real drawbacks and we gain a lot from it. 
Raising the blocksize comes with real problems and we realize no benefit from it.

That is a very flawed argument. Decentralization isn't the sole characteristic that makes bitcoin useful. What if there was no limit to the number of bitcoins? Decentralization probably wouldn't matter in that case. Bitcoin is a balance of many features and incentives. None of the curremcies yoy mention have more than maybe one of the vital characteristics. Why do you need to resolve bitcoin to solving a single problem when there are so many applications for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:31:54
Yeah it's not a replacement, it is an actual improvement to the protocol. With it, more can be done with the same amount of blockspace. With it, transaction malleability is gone. Improving efficency and eliminating transaction malleability are much bigger priorities than upping the blocksize, especially considering we haven't even reached block capacity yet.  What baffles you exactly? 
@_date: 2016-02-03 05:06:56
I agree with you. Did some more reading on the matter. It doesn't  provide anything and creates weird payment scenarios. It does make zero conf basically unusable when currently no miner would purposely start allowing double spends. Still, it is a nuanced subject but basically the "if it ain't broke don't fix it" ethos applies, I guess. No need for RBF. Also once I saw that greenaddress supports it, I knew rbf was trouble.

That's the thing about digital goods though. They're not scarce. So it makes it hard to justify paying for them since it costs nothing to get a copy. Difficult problem to solve. The content that would be paid for has to offer something that the stolen content wouldnt. Even just convenience can be enough.

Bitcoin, in its fundamental operation, cannot scale to handle visa level transaction numbers, ever. It is a physical impossibility no matter how big the blocksize grows. There is not enough bandwidth in the world to make it work.

@_date: 2016-09-14 18:22:38
My statement is not an opinion. It is based on some simple calculations about transaction size, blocksize, and available bandwidth. With the way the protocol works right now, VISA level transaction numbers are impossible.

We have a metric that prevents spam, it's called a transaction fee. If the sender is willing to pay the needed fee, days destroyed or coin amount do not prevent these "spam" attacks you describe. They can't even really be called spam if they pay proper fees, but that's a different discussion. Days destroyed allows one thing. For old coins to be spent without fees. This overall lowers the average fees, which technically makes spam attacks easier. In reality it's just not a very good metric to use when ranking mempool. Maybe useful in an analytic sense, but it does not help to filter transactions very much.

You keep comparing paypal and bitcoin as if they are competing in the same game. They are not. They are totally different beasts. Comparing paypal and lightning is more accurate. 
Regardless, people tend to use the best money available. For some people that's fiat+paypal, for others it is bitcoin+lightning. If you have a website that, say, accepts payment for something that paypal is against, they have the power to seize your funds without any recourse on your part. If instead bitcoin were used, that is not a possibility. That is just one small example of how the two differ. 
Bitcoin will absolutely require a blocksize increase eventually. But look at how much has happened recently with batching+segwit. Look at the horizon for how many more even cooler developments are in the works for bitcoin. The improvements just keep coming!


Do you think that the transaction backlog was from regular old users making their little purchases? I believe it was from colossal services like coinbase and bitfinex that werent batching transactions and completely hammering the mempool. Now that they are batching, bitcoin will have to on-board massive amounts of users to reach those txn levels. To me, that's the good kind of problem.  


You're saying that lightning is doomed because nobody will use it and simultaneously that it will be unable to reasonable support a massive userbase?  Have you heard about the possibility of topping off a lightning channel with out ever cashing out to main chain? That means everyone could potentially pay one fee (ever) to get onto lightning and never have to pay another mainchain fee again (unless they specifically want to). That's pretty neat stuff.

Your arguments are just like those from people who thought computers were to complicated for average joe. And then again with the Internet being too complicated as well. People are smarter than you give them credit. New tech is always hard to use and it always get easier over time. In my view, bticoin is not for buying coffee or as an alternative to PayPal or venmo. Bitcoin competes with national currencies like the dollar or euro. Bitcoin represents the money of the people of the world. It is a stateless currency that is everything we want. Transparent, fair, decentralized, scarce, easily transmitted, easily stored, secure... the list goes on. Why will people use bitcoin? Simple. Because it is frigging awesome.

That's an interesting way to think about it. I belive the government does play a large role in deciding which technologies will win out. They don't control it exactly and in the case of bitcoin, can't stop it even if they wanted to. But they do play a part. I think it would be a bad decision for the government to go against bitcoin. The much smarter play is to support it and get a lions share before bitcoin makes the government as it exists today largely obsolete.

All of these things are either being actively done, are in development or are being explored by multiple independent groups.

The entirety of 2x is antithetical to bitcoin. The 2x (really 4x but I wouldnt expect you to admit that) increase is really not the main contention. IF you think a 2mb blocksize limit is the real point of contention then you are not following along closely enough.

Thats kind of a haughty thing to say. But whatever. I think what you're saying is fair and makes sense. I suppose if you really don't trust the primary devs, that a great reason to avoid the project. I was just saying that you don't necessarily have to trust, or even like the devs and you can still form your own opinion about however much or little of the project you can understand since its all out in the open.

It's mostly number one. Primarily due to a lack of motivation. I have read about it here and there, but the DAO and ETH rollback permanently ruined ETH for me. I cant take the project seriously anymore. Cool your jets though, I'm just being a snarling arsehole.

It wont. Pirates are free! 
It would be like trying to take control of a ship, successfully killing the captain and getting on board, and then in rapid succession the entire original crew, necessary to make the ship work, jumped off into the ocean and swam to and island to start building a new ship. The overtakers would quickly find themselves alone, with a ship they cannot make float.
I wanted to extend the analogy to say the ship has very rare engineers who can keep it floating, and without them the ship rapidly gets eaten by the unforgiving sea.
Except bitcoin is way better than a boat.

There is only one blockchain that can back such a technology as lightning. It's bitcoin. 


Paypal is nothing different than using fiat. Its like a 2nd layer on top of fiat, the lightning network of the busted ass traditional finance system. Paypal was pretty cool, but now it doesn't hold a candle to bitcoin. Dinosaurs only see the asteroid when it is too late. 


Yes, gold is a good analogy. Digital gold is thrown around a lot to describe bitcoin. However, let me ask you: can you store gold in your brain? Didn't think so. Bitcoin is the most secure asset in the world.

It's a huge factor in the price. Value of bitcoin basically follows cost to mine.

I'm sure I can find a product priced ONLY in btc. How does that fit into your perspective? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:52:09
No need. The smart ones know how to set proper fees. Everyone else will learn eventually.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:16:34
Yeah this wasnt much of a question, haha.  
Thinking about it more, I think it is impossible for development to stop on bitcoin. Even if all the current devs stopped right this instant, eventually someone would pick up and keep developing. Even if just for fun. More people would join and it would keep going. Cat is out of the bag and all. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:46:39
If bitcoin keeps working it will keep rising. So far its kept working despite all of the attacks and mistakes. Good track record so far! But of course no one can predict the future. We can only guess. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:38:10
Just because you pay too high of fees does not mean anything to everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:28:36
Oh okay that's roughly in line with what I thought.  
I disagree with you though. I don't think Roger has shown any reason that he is not just self serving to a fault. I'd go so far as to say he is a scammer. But whatever, you're right, in the grand scheme it doesn't matter.

@_date: 2017-09-27 17:47:33


 whatever the fuck that means.  
Exactly. Its hard to say. But back in 2010 you may have not thought bitcoin was going anywhere and didnt buy any. Few years later its worth more and you wish you had valued it more in hindsight. What a bitcoin is worth is a very complicated matter. 


Id say we are still in that brief window with bitcoin.

I did. Results are in: You have no idea what you're talking about.  


Is this supposed to be a joke? 
@_date: 2016-09-21 12:01:46
The basic idea of it. Owning more bitcoin shouldn't give you an advantage in mining over others. It sets up a value funnel that concentrates wealth to those who already have it. The longest chain is the one with the most coins "staked" against it. This means that whoever controls the majority of the coins controls the state of the chain. I'm no expert either. PoS just doesn't seen sensible. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:39:21
They can offer services on top of bitcoin, right? Escrow, buyer/seller protections, loans, etc. Why couldn't they? Hell they could even try to fractionally reserve it.

@_date: 2017-09-24 03:25:26
I dont think this is a problem for movies and music.
DRM for those types of media is broken on a more fundamental level. Artificial scarcity, imposed by central authority or a blockchain, does not get around the fact that anyone can transcode the media and release it to the public. DRM is easily circumvented for simple audio visual media. For example, in the worst case scenario, just re-record it and voila, the DRM is defeated. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:21:35
I think you are of the assumption that we are in disagreement. We are not. I pretty much completely agree with what you wrote. 
But still, people have minimum requirements and those take energy to meet. That energy can come from anywhere, but money is a nice convenient form for most people. So, to meet the minimum requirements that everyone has, they need to spend money.

You heard wrong. But more importantly: You judge which software to run based on the moderation of a subreddit? That's seriously your criterion for what financial software to run?  
Maybe you should look at the software itself and not the political noise surrounding it. Judge the software on how it is implemented, developed and distributed. If you aren't very technically inclined, seek opinions from a diverse set of network participants. Read content aimed at explaining complex technical issues in layman's terms. You should not judge what code to run based on political noise. That is a sure way to get scammed.

@_date: 2017-09-27 23:50:11


Because no one feels a need to do it. Jeff Garzick is already coding it. He feels that there is a need so he writes the code. No other devs feel a need to write the code that the 2x community wants. The 2x community is doing exactly everything it can to develop and foster its codebase. As they should. That is how this open system works. If you have ideas, you share them. If others like them, maybe they build on them. If you build something, maybe others will want to use it. If not, tough cookies. That's how this system works. It is open. It has to be open because behind closed doors freedom dies. So, the 2x community is doing what they believe in and everyone else is also is free to do what they believe in. We will have to see where it all concludes in a few months.

The analogy is fine. Just because something consumes something to survive, it does not necessarily become that thing it consumes. The bankers can pay to hasten their demise all they want. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:35:10
Bitcoin, when faced with reality, has limitations on how it can function reliably. Additionally, given the space Bitcoin is in tends to be quite hostile, bitcoin has to remain resilient against attack. Bitcoin must resist active, well-funded eventually state level attackers AND still be easily distributed and used by anyone across the globe.  
You seem to have solved all of these nuanced balancing acts. Please show me your solution that isn't hopelessly full of defects. Oh wise one please bless us with your solutions!

@_date: 2017-09-08 18:24:31
It could perhaps one day represent the majority of the world's economy and then it would stabilize. Natural economic cycles would be reflected by minimal shifts in the buying power of bitcoin regionally. Globally all of it would average out. I don't think there would as huge of wealth disparities between different regions.

Because of the versioning. Bitcoin is not at 1.0.0 yet and is thus, still beta. Any developer will tell you the same AFAIK. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:22:11
But realistically, people HAVE to spend. They do not have to save.  
That's why it's a huge mistake to operate a system that encourages spending and discourages saving. People NEED to be encouraged to save, not the other way around!
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:42:53
Well it would lose what makes bitcoin valuable, decentralization. So it would be worthless. Also, a govCoin may legitimize bitcoin in many peoples eyes, which could backfire on a central authority. Why not just keep using fiat?

That'd be like 20k btc... I don't think OP can swing that. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:13:19
I think I see what you're saying. But miners do take into account long term potentials when making immediate decisions. I don't think enough miners will jump ship because the ship they'd be jumping onto is made of smoke. The market knows this, as reflected in the coinsplit token, and the users know it, as reflected by the overwhelming number of core nodes. I don't think enough miners will risk going against the majority of the network. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:49:34
I don't kow why you think that. Business cycles? Inflationary monetary policy? What do you mean all currencies are bubbles?

Bitcoin is inherently a political hot topic. It is very divisive. Also there is a lot of uncertainty in bitcoins future. Intel,Nvidia and AMD do not operate in isolation from government. Bitcoin is "anti" centralized control. These factors make it a very touchy subject for the big chipmakers to get involved with.

The seller thinks they got paid but you "double spend" the money back to yourself. Costs you nothing in the end. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:12:46
That's fair. Though I never specifically mentioned government. The Bitcoin protocol encourages it without any type of government involvement. Though the deflationary nature of bitcoin will eventually cease (the subsidy stops) and then it can be a proper inflationary/deflationary currency, becoming whichever one the market dictates when appropriate. There are business cycles and having constant inflation or deflation is silly. Currency should adapt to the state of the economy it represents. Bitcoins economic model allows this to happen very efficiently.

@_date: 2017-09-08 18:30:10
Yes. It is indeed a complex balancing act. There are so many different aspects of the argument that it is hard to pin down the really important parts.  
Government, economy, politics, policy, what have you, these types of things are all so deeply intertwined that it is hard to talk about one aspect without opening the whole can of worms. I'd say that ideas that favor individual control and weak central control are superior to ideas that trend towards strong centralization. One extreme is not better than another, but perhaps there exists a better side of the line to stand on.

The reasons you list do not detract from bitcoins security. Yes, improperly stored bitcoins can be stolen. Like most anything. The fact that bitcoin offers the highest security of any asset possible means it is the most secure. There is no other asset than can be stored in your brain in its totality. The proof of ownership and the actual asset, completely stored inside your brain. That is as safe as it gets.

The developers that choose to contribute ideas and code to bitcoin do not have free reign to do as they please. There are many constraints both inside and outside of the specific domain of development. But, is it really any surprise that developers have a significant control over development?  


This cannot occur as long as lots of bitcoin users run full nodes and make their voices heard. We have to stay somewhat up to date on the various paths forward and decide what is best, together. Developers have no power if no one runs their code. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:49:30
Nodes determine the bitcoin network. If the nodes don't go along, no amount of hashrate can change that.

He supports all of it! Actively aligns himself with a blatantly malicious project.
 &gt;but at that time the fight was about segwit, and without that we'd have no segwit today or a paining uasf split with unknown outcome.   
UASF is what got segwit activated. To think otherwise is delusional. 


He's already said it. Everyone can withdraw if they want to, that is known. However, the people who have not withdrawn have ulterior motives. Any problem that 2x purports to solve has already been solved. There is no network congestion, fees are reasonable, bitcoin is stable. Why in the heck would anyone want to go and mess up a perfectly working system for unnecessary changes? Simple, just like every fork attempt prior, their stated motives are not the actual motives.

You can't be serious. Barry Silbert, founder and ceo of DCG, proposed the scaling solution segwit2x. That is the hard fork which is attempting to usurp the bitcoin network.

To be clear, I never said TCP is the base protocol for everything. You're the only one who has said that. And now you're reversing your statement on SNMP... 
My point was and still is that TCP is the dominant protocol for communication on the internet. This is a fact as far as I am aware. It is dominant because interoperability is key. The layered approach allows for freedom within the stack, but the further you go down the less variation. Yes there are other protocols. No, they are not as widely used as just a handful. No one said anything about one single protocol, just you. The main point is that at the lowest levels, having a bunch of competing protocols does not make sense. If those protocols do wildly different things, maybe, but then they're disparate bases, not the same stack. For crypto, you are arguing for having many base settlements layers... which seems crazy. Bitcoin only needs to do one thing well to be the base layer. For analogy, something like routing packets. Bitcoin handles the base layer and other protocols layered on top can handle other functionality. You keep saying one protocol, and I keep coming back with its a layered approach. Where's the value in a bunch of crypto protocols that essentially do the same thing?

I was referring to the "we need to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the few at the top." sentiment.  Though I think that a more open system by definition allows for more people to get their "fair" share. 
A lot of methods by which wealthy individuals maintain that wealth involves influencing or subverting economic policies. With bitcoin, this type of control is very hard (I would say impossible) for one person, or a even small group, to exert. You actually have to overpower (or work alongside) the will of a massive number of people to get anything done. Look at segwit and the 2x happenings. It's clear that bitcoin is quite difficult for any special interest to control.

Seems pretty reasonable. I can't really generate any interesting responses, but thank you for the food for thought. 


I'd say a growing majority of people will never start mining. It'll always be niche for specialists. 


If this doesn't currently dissuade what few miners we do have, why would it dissuade potential future miners? 
If advancements in mining hardware can pace with difficulty  and keep the balance similar to now, I suppose it only safe to assume that things will stay the same. Which means bitmain maintaining their majority share... hmmm, that's no good. 
Though I do wonder if their majority share is even a problem. The idea that they would be more incentivized to cooperate than attack seems to be holding up just fine. Though hopeful thinking isn't a good basis for bitcoin...

Wall street is going to pump and dump bitcoin as much as they can. It's what they do. 
That doesn't change the fact that bitcoin is on a constant upward trajectory. And not without reason. The technology is sound. Best devs the world around. The concept is battle tested. Ten years and still running flawlessly. The ecosystem is exploding. More adopters, more services, more ideas, more layers, more everything.
The way I see it, wall street's obsession with short term gains is going to make them fuel bitcoin on its astronomical rise to a global currency.


We are creating something useful. That creates value and wealth. Futures contracts do not affect what bitcoin is. They act upon bitcoin, but do not change it fundamentally.

It's for both... maybe it's possible that in the early days of paradigm shifting technology, some group would have to take on some risk and "invest". Just maaaybe.   
If you think volatility makes it more for traders than every day people then I'd say you don't have a clue what you're talking about.   
The main point though is that with bitcoin, there exists no wealth pump that constantly ushers money back to a small minority like with fiat. Over time, the initial distribution disparity of BTC (necessarily caused by bootstrapping) will go away. As the current whales spend their coin, other players can pick it up. Those whales have no inherent mechanism in bitcoin with which to get their coins back. In this way, bitcoin will become one of, but most likely, THE most fairly distributed currencies the world has ever known. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:58:08


I see what you are saying. Basically, this device supports itself by contributing just enough hashing power to be beneficial to the network, and in return can use those highly divisible tokens earned to interact with all kinds of systems (autonomous ones perhaps). Very interesting concept, but still this whole box reeks of centralization. 
Why not an open source CLI/OS (or just some software on top) and instructions on how to paste together a few usb miners and a computer. Would be cheaper, more developer oriented and definitely more open and in line with bitcoin's ideals. 
Then again, these things cost money and who is going to just go and write software for the betterment of mankind? Maybe if this box proves it salt, a deluge of alternative solutions will come forth. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 03:10:00


That's fair. Though you may be sacrificing freedom for a centralized, locked-down, and monitored solution. Not sure if that's the case, but I don't see anyone saying otherwise. The whole premise doesn't seem very open to me. 


Very true. But in the same vein, bitcoin may be much easier to "freely" interface with in that time as well. This product just seems to provide a solution for what is basically a non-issue.

Okay, so it's a computer and a miner in one package. Why not just buy some btc (for far cheaper than this will make it) and then "learn to use bitcoin to buy and sell digital goods and services"? 


A spectacularly tiny source of bitcoin. How does that help with writing programs? I'm not exactly sure. Lets run tests on our software with real bitcoins! Surely that's the cheapest way to test it.


Full copy of (most of) the blockchain... thanks! A CLI for bitcoin? Thats incredible...


Yay! It includes the essential parts of a computer!


This is just confusing. What digital goods does this allow you to sell? The space on the tiny HD, act as a VPS... not exactly sure. I'm probably missing the unique part of this thing. 
I dont like it. The ideas listed [here]( for uses cases are either silly (mining one) or not new:
* instantly mine Bitcoin from the command line - **why on such a tiny scale? and it centralizes the mining to 21**
* sell API calls for Bitcoin, like English-to-Chinese translation or file conversion - **pretty neat**
* set up your own personal iTunes-like digital goods store - **interesting**
* reward peers for posting your links on social media - **interesting**
* make any IoT hardware Bitcoin-rentable, from smart locks to 3D printers - **interesting**
Those are good ideas, but why use this 21 box instead of a regular computer + linux + miner (if you even want it)? With this it looks like you are stuck with their hardware, their datacenter, their command line tools, their drivers, etc. Smells an awful lot like centralization in a big way. Is any of this stuff open source? Thats what really matters here. If this is all locked down, factory fresh garbage, then who would want it? 
TL;DR: These are all interesting, albeit not new, ideas, but what matters is if this whole shebang is open source or not. Does anyone know more? 
EDIT: All of these words came directly from my butt. I encourage anyone and everyone to chime in and correct me on all points.

Okay thank you for clarifying. And thank you for the enlightening debate. I don't agree with you about the need for multiple protocols to maintain a global ledger, but you certainly make arguments in favor. When the protocol deals with scarcity and trust, multiple implementations seems counterproductive. Though obviously as you have shown, that won't stop people from making a glut of protocols anyhow.

I'd go with don't care or don't have the time. Most people are smart enough to understand the basics of crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:01:08
If the bank is, as a convenience, saying you have money that hasn't cleared yet because they are confident it will all settle fine in the near future, then why can't people accept zero-conf txns with BTC? Because those truly are free and instant. And you get the same security as with traditional finance.

@_date: 2017-10-01 22:04:03

That is why people always say to keep as little as possible (or ideally nothing) on custodial exchanges. You shouldn't trust *other* people with *your* money. Better tech will make centralized exchanges irrelevant anyway. Like decentralized exchanges, which we are already seeing.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:34:33
Those types of nodes are usually easy to spot. Honest node count is what matters. 


Hashrate it great, but I don't think it is the sole decider. For one, without constant attention from a very skilled development team, bitcoin, or any coin, would sooner or later fail. That alone is a big reason why hashrate doesnt matter that much. Miners just run code, just like user nodes. That code, the network, the politics, the nuances of that system, all of that is what bitcoin "is" and the miners are simply not the unstoppable entity you make them out to be. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:59:43


True. But the many-to-many nature of transactions makes tracking coins/taint analysis of limited effectiveness for actually linking people to events.

@_date: 2018-04-28 17:29:22
Good! Keep spreading it around. The more people spend it, the better the distribution becomes. Big holders right now will, over time, spread those coins out and without any mechanism to unfairly generate new bitcoins, there is no wealth pump effect. So every bit the bitcoin economy strengthens leads to better distribution of wealth. At least that is how I see it. Even the big pump and dump whales get bites taken out of them. It is a very free market.

Compare bitcoin to another protocol like tcp. Sure there are alternatives to tcp, but they're not anywhere near as popular. They have their niche use cases and their own set of tradeoffs, thats why they exist, but they arent used nearly as much as tcp. It helps when everyone is using the same protocol. Bitcoin is a protocol just like any other. Having tons of competing protocols seems counterproductive.

I agree with the poster you responded to. 
At least with how bitcoin works currently, a high transaction load would crush it. So called coffee purchases should be on a level 2 like lightning that is more suited for it. Buying a house would maybe occur "on-chain" since that is a much bigger and more critical purchase. 
However, layer 2 technologies can only exist because of how secure and resilient bitcoin is. Without bitcoin, you cant have lightning or any of the other cool smart tech. We need bitcoin to retain all of the qualities that make it awesome and to keep it stable above all else. This stability and resiliency will allow confidence to be put into any technologies built upon Bitcoin.

You would need a way to hash the print so it can be compared to a reference hash. The problem is that you can't reliably generate a hash from a physical object like a photograph.

What bitcoin is: trustless, decentralized (amongst other things)
What bitcoin can never be: cheaper than centralized services, faster than centralized services, (amongst other things)
If I don't run a full node I no longer am getting a trustless bitcoin. I have to trust some other groups or groups. If I don't run a full node, I hurt the decentralized nature of bitcoin and I additionally further centralize my own transactions. Do you see why I say that you are actually not using bitcoin if you dont run a full node?
If you dont run a fully validating node, the two major benefits of bitcoin are lost. I might as well use a centralized service (paypal/fiat, whatever else) as they are faster, cheaper, easier and better than bitcoin in practically every way except for a few. Those few reasons are what make bitcoin different. They are what make bitcoin valuable and worthwhile. If you don't need those qualities, you don't need bitcoin. 


You actually didn't ask me that. But it's a moot point. You said:


The expected loss is infinite. So regardless of how much my budget for a full node is, if I do not run a full node I am losing. I HAVE to run a full node at any cost if I want to use bitcoin.

There is one real difference between bitcoin and every other currency. Can you tell me what that is? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:40:52
Yeah what you are saying is correct, but what is your point? 
Bitcoin is in the investment stage. Does anyone expect to get a huge return by only investing for a short time period? That never really happens with any kind of investment. Dont invest anymore than you can afford to lose. Once you buy BTC, consider the "dollars" spent and gone. You have BTC now. 
If the game is to buy a few coins and then hope it goes to 1000 USD (or what puts money signs in your eyes) and then selling, then that is a get rich quick scheme and then who cares about the fundamentals. So day trade, do whatever, but don't complain about volatility. 
If ones belief is that bitcoin is going to be successful, then whats the problem with hodling for a long time until the initial investment pales in comparison to its current worth?
Basically it boils down to this: 
Bitcoin is going to be successful and be tremendously valuable, or it is going to be worth squat. If you believe in the former, then no matter when you buy BTC, or how much you pay for it, it is always going to appreciate in the long run. If you believe in the latter, then investing in bitcoin basically becomes a gamble. You can decide what your motives and odds are, etc. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:59:07
The same security as all other web wallets, right? 
Individuals using their own locally hosted wallets wouldn't be as vulnerable. If an attacker infiltrated the wallet's repo or wherever people download it from, it would be unlikely that a large number of users would update to the new malicious version before word got out. (Unless it auto pushed updates, but that would be silly.) But with a web wallet, every time a user logged in, the malicious web wallet code would be loaded and everyone would be vulnerable at once.

Eh his power is very easily taken away. The high fee situation in bitcoin is ideal for him right now. He knows the long term trend in price is up. That means moving forward it is harder and harder to get coins. Subsidy goes down, coin value goes up, equals harder to get more coins. The obvious winning strategy given that information is to take advantage of the congestion and high fees to accumulate as much btc as possible. As soon as the threat of bitcoin  going down becomes even a bit real, Jihad will jump on Segwit like he invented it. Then boom, moon,  and his massive pile of accumulated coins are worth a fortune.

That'd probably be for the best. Modern industrial agriculture is unable to cope with growing food demand. Local, sustainable agriculture is the only way to solve the logistics problem and to also actually create enough food for everyone. It's a fact that intensive gardening yields more food than industrial agriculture. Burning fossil fuels is a grave mistake. It provides the illusion of efficiency (using ancient stored energy sure is easy) but with a potential downside that far outweighs the benefits. Also, what prevents people from making bioplastics? Cheap oil. That's it. Without our abuse of oil, we would be eons ahead in manufacturing environmentally sane plastics.

@_date: 2017-05-07 15:12:43
okay. But the costs for increased blocksize are numerous and often not obvious. Just one of the many considerstions: At the current 1 mb size there is already intense pressure for mining to centralize and to cheat in various ways (headers only spv mining bs for one)which is no good. That only gets worse if we just bump the size. That's just one of the numerous risks to bumping the blocksize before first optimizing the living shit out of what we have.

You could create a centralized ledger to maintain software licenses or concert tickets, etc. But the point that is being made in this thread is that the btc blockchain allows it to be done in a decentralized manner.

We do. And we get a stable, decentralized, censorship resistant, digital bearer bond and ledger that sidesteps all central control and creates a global level playing field for information transfer. Bitcoin is plainly incredible.
No alt-coin can compete, for if they grow to bitcoins size, they will face and have to solve bitcoin's problems. And no one is more qualified to scale bit coin than the core contributors. They have repeatedly proven this. Bitcoin being resistant to change at anyone's whim is a strength. Stability is key. 
And yes, who cares about TPS and transaction fees [as long as Bitcoin remains decentralized] ! I totally agree. Decentralization is one of, if not, the most important qualities of the whole Bitcoin network.

@_date: 2017-05-03 19:46:01


It is an extremely poor example.
I will try to explain why. In order for a currency to be deflationary (or inflationary) the economy needs to be changing in size. If the total value of the economy is increasing, then the value of each currency token will increase proportionally. Thus, each token is worth more tomorrow than today. However, in order for the real physical economy to be growing, work must be being done. Work requires energy which is easily represented by money. The money that is being spent to grow the real physical economy has to come from somewhere. So someone is spending money. Yes! Someone is spending money in a deflationary cycle. The value tokens are increasing in value, as they should, and the physical economy is growing. Most importantly, the physical economy and paper economy match up, both are staying connected. If some disaster struck, or any other mishap, the economy could go into an inflationary cycle. This is where the value of the physical economy is decreasing and the value tokens are now proportionally worth less. Still the physical and paper economies are aligned. But now people are generally more inclined to spend what they have gambling that they can get more in return. They will do this by investing in the real economy. Build things or do research or whatever it takes to get a ROI. Enough people head in that direction and the inflationary cycle is left behind for a deflationary boom. The cycle repeats. Always in sync, always representing the actual economy and desires of the people within that economy and all the other infinitely complex factors. This is something that cannot be achieved by a tiny fraction of the population attempting to manually manage the majority of economic activity. The economy is best left to manage itself as much as possible.

That may work for compilers, but isn't good enough for Bitcoin nodes. Nodes need to be in complete lockstep with each other and have total compatibility.

There is a infinite demand for blockspace. It will fill up not matter how big you make it. Raising the blocksize is a linear solution to a non-linear problem. It cannot work. We need to scale transaction throughput by a larger factor than 1. Second layer solutions accomplish that. It's really simple to understand if you take the time. But sadly you're too busy calling well informed people "thick in the head"...

I see your point. That's a reasonable concern. Though it doesn't bother me too much. Good money drives out bad. The banks can do whatever they want. As long as bitcoin keeps delivering on its premise, then the banks' days are numbered. The traditional monetary system can only hope to taint bitcoin and confuse users to delay the inevitable. Software, just like ideas, cannot be stopped. 
However, if bitcoin compromises on any of its primary ideals, then it is doomed. One false step and bitcoin is left by the wayside. We cannot afford to make concessions in order to gain popularity. Good money drives out bad. Bitcoin will take over, as long as it can remain uncorrupted.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:19:28


Good! Bitcoin (like any other clone of it) cannot handle every transaction in the world on layer one. I'd rather have things like house purchases and wealth storage on the main chain, instead of coffee transactions. As bitcoin becomes more popular, more common use cases will out price less common ones. 


Cool. If you think that any alt won't face the same issues if they were to get as popular as bitcoin then you are delusional. Alts don't have the challenges that bitcoin has because no one uses them. The only one with any tiny chance of usurping bitcoin is litecoin and that's because it's basically an exact clone of bitcoin but with segwit activated. Kinda telling that. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:17:37

@_date: 2015-11-03 18:39:12
As long as you can easily (and noninvasively) get your coins into and out of the centralized service, you can still get all the benefits of bitcoin. Bitcoin is so decentralized you can build services powered by it and other people can use them seamlessly (if you build the service sensibly).  The users then can choose which (if any) services they would like to use. 
In the specific case of changetip, it's just convenience. Using pure bitcoin, people could exchange addresses and tipping would only be mildly less convenient. In the case of online tipping, bitcoin is much more convenient than dollars, gold or credit cards by a long shot. Heck, if reddit integrated a native bitcoin tipping system, it would be even better than any third party attempt. 
All of these awesome possibilities are brought about by such a "simple" thing like bitcoin. That is really cool.

Everything in Bitcoin is (ideally) completely transparent. All the information you need is freely available in many places around the internet. You have to fend for yourself when it comes to personally managing your finances. If you want to be spoon-fed, bitcoin is not for you!

It's good advice that people often forget. It's like telling people not to gamble away their livelyhoods. It's obviously a dumb thing to do, but people still do it! Or, to not to keep coin on an exchange where you don't have the private keys. If people actually listened to good advice, far fewer would get scammed in such obvious ways.

I wasn't expecting you to argue against all possibilties, just wanted to point out that AGW causing an extinction level event is not an unheard of idea. Could just be a popsci idea promoted to "get views"... Also, choosing a daily mail article to debunk is possibly the lowest hanging fruit possible, but that's beside the point.  
You seem like a very reasonable and knowledgeable person and I'd love to debate this further. I'll do some proper research into real sources and come back with a more substantial argument. I don't believe it's that far fetched of a result of AGW and as such I should be able to cobble together and decent arguement for that.
Off the top of my head though, can you give me some insight into these vague concepts?
-clathrate gun   
-rising ocean acidity reducing it's carbon sinking ability  
-rising sea levels  
-increasingly extreme weather  
You're probably much more knowledgeable on those "sound byte" concepts so I'd love a dose of rationality. Thank you for taking the time to have a debate about this stuff.  I really just want to know more about the "true" situation our planet is facing.

No, no. You must see the important difference.
 If I have private keys and you do not, then I have bitcoin and you do not. You say you can use your IOUs all the same as my bitcoins, but what do you do when [insert Web wallet of choice] freezes your account, goes under, gets hacked, or otherwise bars you from what you believe to be yours? 
See the difference? When you own private keys you need no faith in any other single entity. If you have IOUs you must inherently trust the issuer of those IOUs. It's a massive difference. 
Please try to see for yourself why one is very good and the other alternative is very bad.

To me that is like saying "even if fish wanted cellphones, they simply can't use them". The more important question is: do banks want to use btc? To which I would respond with a resounding NO. Certainly not the cypherpunk, freedom first, version of bitcoin. But maybe if the banks can pervert bitcoin into something that they like (ermagerd blockchain), and convince everyone else that what they are offering is the real deal, then they can win by not even fighting us. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:32:50
More individually controlled nodes = more decentralization  (duh)  
Migrating to fewer, data center nodes = less decentralization (duh)
Less decentralization = bitcoin is pointless (duh)
I think nullc is saying that below a certain threshold of decentralization you are better off just using a fully centralized service. Semi-decentralized systems (like a bitcoin with only large data center nodes) are generally worse than either mostly decentralized systems or fully centralized ones. With bitcoin, if you stray too far from what makes it unique, then you might as well just go fully centralized.

As far as I am concerned I just don't like the idea of the term blockchain being diluted to the point of losing significance. But yeah, bitcoin is very anti-bank. It's kind of the whole reason it's any good. 


I would disagree with this statement. What makes you say this? 


Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it not? Bitcoin is really fucking revolutionary. Totally different. Paradigm shifting. Holy fuck balls this is really new unexplored territory. People say the banks are scared. Everyone is scared. This is the wild west. The new gold rush. So yes, there is a lot for new comers to take in. A steep learning curve, for sure. But, with each passing day it gets easier and easier to get and use bitcoin. For everyone. Bitcoin is for everyone. 


Bitcoin is branching out everywhere, and rapidly. I can't see how anyone can argue that it is not. Also, being completely opensource, it literally is the most accepting currency in the world. 


Bitcoin doesn't need to be cool. It is a boring lame ass protocol that just also happens to be one of the most interesting inventions in a long time. Bitcoin needs to be stable. Bedrock. The foundation of an effectively infinitely reliable, global, decentralized ledger. Cool just comes as a side effect of that. Slow and steady wins the race. Good money drives out bad. Blah blah blah only layer one, we got it. 


Again, this is just not really true. Yes bitcoin attracts those types for very obvious reasons. Yes, those types of individuals tend to be vocal. BTC is for everyone. The conflicts in the dev community are good. They foster open and sometimes heated debate. Peoples true colors are shown. Seems to be a pretty decent way to develop open software to me. And, if nothing else, very entertaining. 


A lot of people have heard the term bitcoin by now. But not nearly as many have any substantial grasp on bitcoin. Hell I barely know how bitcoin works when it gets down to it. What makes you say that bitcoin is a punchline? I think (and I know many others do) that bitcoin is fucking awesome.

You're  missing the fundamental point that you cannot separate the blockchain from the currency, at least not if you want bitcoin to remain decentralized. Bitcoin, having the first mover advantage, is difficult to displace at this point. 


It is a global distributed financial ledger. Far from useless. 


One quick example, the internet -&gt; bitcoin. Beautiful use for old infrastructure in a way that had only been theorized about until recently. 


Because you cannot separate the two.

That is like saying distributing media via CD is better than through the internet. Those alternate payment solutions are better than traditional banking, but bitcoin is better than them all (depending on your values).
As of this moment, there probably aren't too many reasons to switch from MPESA (or what have you) to bitcoin. But perhaps if bitcoin becomes a global currency in a big way, then the benefits of switching would be greater. 
The infrastructure (mobile networks/phones) are already pretty much in place for them to join the global bitcoin network if they decide that is something they want to do. That's pretty neat.

ETH is a joke. The premise is smart contract where code is law. Then, at the first sign that their obviously overly complex smart contract (DAO) worked exactly as it was designed to, but against the wishes of some portion of the network, they forked off and reversed it all.
The whole project lost any shred of credibility right there

I'm not convinced of the severity of this attack. Not to say that I support hardforking willy nilly either. 
Even if there exists a doppelganger bitcoin, and a large portion of casual crypto users are disheartened, the original bitcoin will still be useful and just as secure. 
Useful and secure sounds like a winning formula to me. I think people will still use bitcoin, especially so in those cases where bitcoin's unique qualities are desired.

This is really ominous. What state wouldn't want to take control of bitcoin. This is a very real and imenent threat and possible explains some of the crazies foaming at the mouth for a blocksize increase.

Well for one, the internet is not always a perfect network, so having more nodes means there are more chances to connect. Also, I'd figure in a similar manner to bittorrent, having more "peers" would speed up data transfer such as block propagation.

The protocol can change as concensus desires, so no it is not irrevocable.

It uses bitcoin when people cash out. You can't have "off-chain" transactions without a chain to begin with. You don't seem to fully grasp how value is transferred traditionally, and that is impeding your ability to realize how bitcoin does it differently. Paypal and changetip could not build this service without bitcoin or something like it that provides the necessary benefits over traditional banking systems.

@_date: 2017-07-06 01:51:34
I don't think you give them enough credit. 
Perhaps they saw segwit as inevitable (and why not, its good tech) and saw an opportunity to profit by creating uncertainty in the market. 
They knew the music would stop eventually and just have to get it together in time for the upgrade to occur with minimal disruption.
If bitcoin really is going to continue to explode 100x/1000x/10000x in value, every fraction of a coin that you can get your grubby paws on now is that much more valuable.
Everyone is just doing what they are expected to, the self-interested greedy thing. And so far, fucking amazingly, bitcoin continues to take advantage of those incentives and balance them into a functioning decentralized network. Its cool shit and we are so lucky as to get to watch it first hand. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:10:51

At this time, save for a few niche uses, yes I have to agree. Fiat is more useful for the average person right now than bitcoin is. But yet you are still missing the point.

What's wrong with btc in its current state?
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:55:37
If you aren't capable of verifying the state of the network, then you aren't sure of anything. How much bitcoin do you own, did your transaction get accepted in the latest block, are payments being double spent, etc. You can trust a third party to tell you those important facts (like with SPV), but the point of bitcoin is to be trust-less and for you to "be your own bank". If you don't run a node, some would go as far as to say that you aren't even using bitcoin.
Also, a critical part of bitcoin is the fact that it is decentralized. Every additional privately owned, independently verifying node, helps strengthen the network and further increase decentralization. By running a node you are helping make the whole network better. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:36:55

The point is that there is counterparty risk before that settlement occurs. Which means the transactions are occurring off-chain. Meaning your coin can be stolen since it's in a custodial, off-chain account.
Yeah, sounds just as secure as a fully on-chain transaction...

My suggested solution is not really using bitcoin. But neither is an etf. I was making the point that custodial ownership of bitcoin is equally easy with an etf or with custodial bitcoin wallet services. The pre-tax usage is the only benefit of the etf. Otherwise, people can use custodial wallets and it's just as easy. Or they can get real, and actually buy and hold some bitcoin.

There are a finite amount of BTC. People that hold disproportionately large amounts of BTC will redistribute to everyone else by using it. With fiat and the ability for a select few to control currency generation, a wealth pump is created that concentrates money into the hands of those that can create it. With bitcoin, lacking this money creation ability, large holders today will redistribute their money to everyone else by using it. And unlike with fiat, unless those large holders do something productive to earn back their coin, they will slowly lose their horde and the wealth unbalance will lessen.

Energy costs money. Mining takes energy. Miners don't mine for free. So the question is: Does it make sense that miners will want more compensation for coins mined at a higher cost? I would say yes. The more energy embedded in a bitcoin means the more money a miner will want for it.

Oh if this isnt the shitposter calling the shitposter shit. There is a great proposal: SegWit. It can be activated immediately. Hard to get faster than immediate. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:10:49
For account verification they should just hash a few critical bits of PII and make you do the same on your end. Then you can give them the hash to prove who you are as needed. Maybe include a rotating salt in there every time you actually use it to prove your identity so that previous hashes are useless.

What does that have to do with wallets allowing manual fee selection? The transaction will still be built by the wallet.
Also, manually building transactions (small ones, or even test net) is a good way to really learn the details of Bitcoin's implementation.

Yes. Hence, it was a reasonable reason to hard fork. 
With ETH, the fork happened because some whiny early investorbabies wanted their money back, because they were too highfalutin to read the damn contract they signed. Its a joke. The hard fork makes a mockery of everything that ETH stands for.

The middle two points are true of bitcoin itself. The first point is a downside yeah but not a big one. The last one seems acceptable. Need fancy transactions, go main-chain. Sounds reasonable.

It is the second part of "move fast and break things". ETH leads the industry in breaking things. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:11:02
Honestly taxes are almost reasonable. I think a lot of people complain about QE and unchecked derivatives markets and whatever other nonsense goes on. Stealing enabled by having control over the markets. The financial system is pretty messy and perhaps quite skewed in the favor of a few.Though I'm not sure and not informed enough to say. 
Also, on the even more extreme side, I think some people are of the opinion that taxes are theft by threat of force. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:24:39
How do bigger blocks solve the profitable spamming policy? Why can miners not just fill up more of the bigger blocks and achieve the same inflated fees?

Was talking about coinbase, since you for some reason believe their internal transactions+eventual settlement is the same as on-chain all the way.  


Yes that is the definition of an off-chain transaction.  


If the txn gets reorged out then yeah no transaction occurred on-chain... by definition.  


No full node, no bitcoin. SPV transactions are barely bitcoin transactions. They take all the important aspects (decentralization, trustlessness, individual validation, etc...) and throw them away for dangerous convenience. 
Also, I love how you have moved the goalposts from offchain/on chain to just "what is a bitcoin transaction". Weird.

@_date: 2016-07-16 11:35:12
I wouldn't agree that it has nothing to do with energy cost. Difficulty skyrockets in response to the cheap/free energy. Bitcoin may self adjust to maintain an equilibrium, but it is most definitely affected by changes in the cost of energy. Or more directly, it is affected by changes in the cost of mining. Which is largely (but not totally) determined by the cost of energy.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:52:20
Haha good point!

Eventually integrated miner/heaters will be made. Generates hashes and heat output for residential/commercial/industrial. There's always a need for heat, might as well make some blocks instead of burning it throught a simpler resistive element. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:00:30
Other than native bitcoin, other services offer all of those features. The main value of OB is it being decentralized. It's also the main reason it has to work as it does, quite clunky for now. Which is fine, tradeoffs should be made for liberty.

@_date: 2017-06-01 19:03:53


I thought those subtle differences were inevitable as people cannot predict the complete workings of a complex enough system. So encouraging different implementations becomes dangerous as it guarantees the different implementations will not be compatible on some level.
Though I suppose if you make the spec "finite" enough, perhaps its possible to fully cover every possible quirk.
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:23:44

Reflection. Determine what is important to you, then go out and find it and support it.
If you are having trouble deciding between core and classic you have a lot more research to do. In my opinion they are very much in contrast to each other and from what I know the choice is easy and apparent.

So in our current situation we have a miner/conglomerate with a lions share of hash rate, which means that raising the blocksize would be wreckless. Giving that large miner disproportionately more fee revenue and simultaneously furthering mining centralization due to the large "full" blocks. Doesn't sound good.

Nodes allow individuals to have their own, untampered copy of the blockchain. This is integral to ensuring the valid state of the blockchain in a trust less fashion. Nodes are absolutely critical to ensuring bitcoin is trust less and decentralized. 
By running a node, an individual can contribute to the security of the bitcoin network and do their part to secure their bitcoins personally.

BTC has value because so far it has a solid track record. ETH has a solid track record of misfortune and deception. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:06:56
Bitcoin isn't necessarily about being "easy". That is a quality necessary in any serious currency. The problem is that the value of Bitcoin is still quite volatile. No one is comfortable saying where it's value will settle. 
Bitcoin's volatility ensures that larger operations will not adopt it. The potential for loss would be far too great. So, for the time being, Bitcoin stands as the first and most popular crypto-currency. The early adopters get to play with it, and then sometime down the road it will boom or bust. Perhaps to be succeeded; perhaps, imitated.  But get on board! There is nothing scary about btc, and as a currency, it has some great features. 
Bitcoin has been around a while and I think it's here to stay.
