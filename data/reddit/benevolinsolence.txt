Because 20 dollar transaction fees are so useful
@_date: 2014-07-25 15:50:01
It took one week but that's largely just how long it takes to transfer the money (2-3 business days). Later on when you get more verfied they give you the coin before the transfer actually goes through but you can't blame them for not doing it immediately.

I understand not sharing the same feeling towards it but not seeing the appeal? You can't imagine a situation where someone would not have time to get and eat a meal? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:14:07
Easier (not for me or you for big money and old money) and more compatible with tax law and ordinary investment

Coinbase doesn't let you buy on credit though
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:24:44
I think we can all do math. If its available cheaper somewhere else, you buy it there. Its hard to beat 150 on 500, they would have to raise prices on everything significantly for that to matter. I know what I want is at the cheapest i can find it.
Also, things will often go up in price around a sale due to demand.

What are you talking about? The hacker is not your neighbor he doesn't know shit about your spouse or church or who you are. You're talking about some Hollywood level shit. Besides anyone who has shady transactions that isn't an idiot uses cash or some equivalent. That is like the craziest edge case I've ever heard.
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:40:02
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:41:59
I'm not talking about those other things im talking about the coinbase api. I dont care what happened to pf changs if the api gives read only buy/sell data your coins are safe.

But to an extent you can say that about corporate tax. " if corporations didn't pay tax on income we would see the savings"
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:19:07
Even then. In the unlikely case mint gets hacked in a way that access usernames and passwords (which some of the ones you mentioned did not and is very unlikely due to their setup) all my financial accounts have 2fa so I wouldn't care much.

Gov slowly undresses
@_date: 2014-07-24 23:15:29
After overdrafting your account yeah. It says on the coinbase site that credit is there only as a backup payment method. Very different from what we're talking about here.
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:45:37
Some people don't want their bills declined
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:34:15
Why that last part? Why is it impossible for some people to make a point without being condescending?
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:23:27
This is false.
The security has nothing to do with mint and everything to do with coinbase. You can set the api key to only relay buy and sell prices and you can disable it at anytime. 
Stop it with the paranoia.
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:00:53
No no it has everything to do with math. 
If product a is the same price at newegg that it is everywhere else it is cheaper to now buy it at newegg.
The sale is far from moot. Even in your example with the 150 off 500 deal the item will be cheaper than it was before they raised the price 230-(230*30%)=161. And even if it was more expensive in your example it would not mean the whole sale is moot. It is all math.

There's never a chance see what actually happened in the target leak. Credit card fraud is really easy to reverse
@_date: 2014-07-24 23:19:09
Yeah no thats crap. I have never uploaded anything to coinbase. For your first purchase you need to verify email, personal info and bank account. You never need to upload anything.
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:24:19
The only thing transmitted to mint is transaction data, I could show the world that and not care
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:48:44
The 3k transaction rule seems inane with the way Bitcoin transactions work. Why would I not just send 20 $1500 transactions rather than 1 $30000 one?

This is an Egyptian recipe. It's is similar in taste to Turkish baklava but different in size and consistency. It stilll has the same ingredients though (sugar, fillo dough, nuts etc)
The main difference is Turkish baklava is generally flat whereas ours is rolled.

Funnily enough I'm actually not at all, like this is my first post on this sub. 
I don't own any coins and I'm not particularly interested in the technology. I just thought it would be a funny costume.

The US is huge. If you're in Cali or NY sure it's everywhere but Oregon or Kansas, not so much.

Most people not right away but generally people didn't have to ask.
The whole night I had groups of people with puzzled looks staring at me then one of them would have a lightbulb moment and come over and yell "Are you the blockchain?!". Especially later on with the lights people really liked it, I was pleasantly surprised at the reactions. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:16:14
Works now, really sorry about that coinbase changed their api and i didnt notice.
If you'd still like to place an order, I'll give upgrade it to a size larger for the inconvenience. Really unprofessional on my part not to have tested it extensively. 
EDIT: Now the coinbase page just 404s. Coinbase support is unresponsive. I'll switch to a different processor. Until then, I'm really sorry about that.
EDIT2: Everything's working now with BitPay. Offer still stands, thank you.
@_date: 2018-10-29 16:57:28
Yeah I mean I wore it for 5 hours at a 100 person party so I'm pretty far past feeling any sort of embarrassment haha
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:52:54
It's a long kept family recipe so I'd like to think it's better than what you'd get on a street corner in Cairo haha.
@_date: 2018-10-29 23:27:33
Yeah but it's not in person and I'm never going to see anyone here again.
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:11:04
Not really, this is intentionally goofy looking and people loved it. 
If you can't laugh at yourself on Halloween then when can you?
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:16:39
Yeah I was very hesitant to upload but eh, if it makes people laugh I'm glad to share it.
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:34:19
I'm really glad you appreciate it, glad it brightened up your day friend.
@_date: 2016-06-12 14:35:43
If you have any questions or concerns let me know! I'd be glad to address them.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:47:49
I would love to but I don't think that's in our scope right now. Bit too small for that.
@_date: 2016-06-13 02:17:27
Hey thanks so much! I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:15:43
I have a background in Medical IT so I'm very used to having to addressing issues quickly haha.

They're cardboard party favor boxes that I painted and cut holes in. Then I just threaded them onto the chain.
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:21:54
Yeah I didn't take it as a diss, just giving some context. But yeah, thanks man!
@_date: 2018-10-30 05:06:50
Most of my family has seen this and thinks it's hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:17:52
Haha. I actually did have some homemade "bitcoins" in one of the boxes that I gave out to people.
They were just orange pieces of cardboard with the B on them lol
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:57:06
Surprised it took this long to get a racist comment. Not Indian btw, not that it matters to you
@_date: 2018-10-29 15:10:08
Someone brought glowsticks and people kept giving them to me so by the end of the night [it looked like this.](
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:14:06
That's funny because there were mimes at the party! They loved the costume haha. 
But thanks yo, glad you liked it, it took a surprising amount of work.
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:13:10
Just this room actually, this was one of the 4 bedrooms, most people were downstairs in the living room. 
Edit: also if you don't include me there are 2 men and 2 women in this photo
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:15:14
Yes! We bake it in a local kitchen in Carlstadt, NJ. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:32:17
This has nothing to do with either. Both can be easily stolen.

In business email is still king.

... Is there only one bitcoin or something? He's talking about market cap not individual value 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:24:44
If bitcoin does go to something absurd like $1000000 per coin wont satoshi nakamoto have enough money to basically take over the world?
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:56:27
He's not talking about actual taz hes saying paypal and ebay fees are a tax.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:18:31
Exactly. No one's gonna double spend a coffee.
