You can use technology as a decent example to see why deflation wont really be a huge issue. Every year computers are getting better and cheaper, why do people buy computers this year when three years from now they can get one with double the power at half the price?
The answer is they need a computer now.
People are realistically not going to hold out on purchases they need for extended durations of time, and if they don't need something maybe it's good they aren't buying it.

I had to make a website for a friend of mine a week ago, didn't use nfs because they don't accept bitcoin. I'll consider using the service againt when/if he changes his mind :)
I the model of nfs but there's so many other hosts out there accepting bitcoins id rather use.
