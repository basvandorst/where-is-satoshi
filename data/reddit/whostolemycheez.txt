Average and mean are the same thing. You’re thinking about median

Most likely less than 1. Maybe around .5. But then again that is. Complete guess as no one really admits how much they truly have.

Stop trying to buy for short term profits ��

Yeah it’s stupid, maybe I’ll get him to do a push-up for each one idk

Also when I was getting into crypto everyone would tell me to do my research and understand what I’m investing in before making a purchase. Now everyone says just buy buy buy even though the newcomers have no idea what it is they’re investing in.

At no point did I take anything against their will. Plus it’s not even my campaign

I have faith this isn’t going to make him no where close to a full bitcoin.... That is why I made it as a joke and have been sending him literally not even a dollar. Did you read the post?

It’ll definitely give awareness to all the newbies of how crypto is a risky business and anything can happen
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:51:37
This isn’t meant to make him any money. Hence why I gave him roughly a dollar in BTC a couple times so far...

Glad to clear things up for you
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:30:02
Including the decimal point too ��

Slowly keep adding a grand at a time. You can decide out often you’d like to do it too as it would be safer than putting any amount you choose all at once

Isn’t the problem 99% of this sub has that you didn’t buy bitcoin when you first heard of it? Cut me some slack dude, I bought a little bit to get to know how it works before I buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:31:17
I’m saying this because it doesn’t make any sense to sell anything that you’ve bought if you’ve had the mentality of accepting you’re losing the cash you’ve already put in since all it stands is to grow in the long run

What does the fork mean? As in how will it change the prices/profit?
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:45:01
Is it a bad thing to let coinbase hold the wallet? With this fork coming up and me getting into bitcoin a couple hours ago I felt it would smart to let them handle whatever kind of changes that will be done, especially since it’s a negligible amount on there. Thanks for your help bro!

Okay? But this is actual currency and doesn’t have nearly as many downsides of the currency that has been used up until recent history. I just got into this but it just seems logical to just invest into this and nothing else. Beanie babies were just a hype and can be replicated easily with counterfeits. Idk just my 2 cents 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:49:03
Thanks bro!
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:47:46
I should have clearer on what I was trying to convey. What I meant was that I know that I can’t get a key from them as they hold onto the wallet, but what Can I do to to regain control of said currency. Thanks for the info though

Fork not happening
