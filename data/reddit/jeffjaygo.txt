yup. they are constantly giving people sitting at poker tables some free sports bets as well... the poker on this site is great, but the sports is even better

damn they might've changed it, there used to be a weekly 10btc freeroll and a daily 1btc freeroll... now it looks like the most is 500mbtc but still, there are tonsss of freerolls with opportunities to win bitcoin for playing some hands without a risk.
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:50:42
thats just the hourly. they have weekly freerolls with 10BTC total prizes...
