Just in case someone is feeling lucky today and want to brute force Satoshi’s treasure

You can view the open code on github and even run the code offline

I got it!

Hello galactic friend :) the terminal freezes when a match is found and the last output will be the key in WIF format ready for copy and restore on any bitcoin wallet.

The total amount of the coinbase transaction is 0.28.
0.009 is going to this address 1M7L2mx9KDds3eL9eChzEffjUUEo1Mpdbs and 0.27 is going back to the sender as change.
If you cant see the 0.009 it’s because of blockchain.com. 
I recommend you to move your founds to a much safer wallet that is not a third party hot wallet.

Try contact blockchain.com.
Also be aware when you using blockchain.com that you are actually using the real website and not a phishing website.
Again, this wallet in general is not recommended.

For me bitcoin is to think differently from the norm. If we can’t do things differently and more simple why not? If we want to get massive adoption I think we need to be more adjustable for changes to make it easy for the rest of the world to take part in this economy.

I think there is a huge difference between a system of money that supposed to serve regular people than a financial product who is not for everyone. If bitcoin has become a product, the future of it won’t be bright. Do you think we need to look at bitcoin as an exclusive product for smart people? How bitcoin could expend that way?

For me it’s easy to keep my seed in 512 bit in hex format but for non-technical people it’s easier to use the BIP-39 which basically convert the seed to words with a checksum scheme. So what if it’s well established? It doesn’t mean that it’s the best way to do it.

Really? Do you know how to creat a WIF format private key from a raw number? Do you know how to create a public key from private key with ECC or you let your wallet do that for you? 
You know that people worked very hard to make things easier in bitcoin for 99% of the bitcoin users today. It really not nice to be so arrogant and think that the majority of people in the world needs to be educated as you are.

Because than everyone needs to know that 1 satoshi = 0.00000001
Microbit = 0.000001
Milibit = 0.001
Don’t you think it kind of hard to memorize when you are new to bitcoin. It has to be more effective way to split units and make them more intuitive for the rest of the planet, don’t you think?
