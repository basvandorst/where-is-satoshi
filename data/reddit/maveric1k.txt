To be fair he wasn't lying, the price of a coin was 320 just last week.
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:36:33
Yes, I can get instant coins as well, only up to a certain amount, something like $100. I'm talking about buying 15-20 bitcoins in one clip though.

Gox fiat wires take "months" to process?? That is a ludicrous amount of time. And they are/were the most reputable bitcoin dealer? Sheesh.
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:39:51
It doesn't matter what price you "buy" those coins on coinbase. It takes up to FOUR BUSINESS DAYS for the transaction to settle. So... good luck in a downward spiral that we are currently experiencing to get the price you like. Bitcoin could crash to 100 and it doesn't matter because you bought them at 350. These go betweens are complete garbage.

Great question. This needs more up upvotes for visibility.
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:37:54
Okay so he exaggerated by 5%. As of his post the price has declined 45% since the beginning of the year. Everyone in here are so quick to jump down someones throat if they say anything less than cheerleading for Bitcoin.

I bought 7 coins on Coinbase a week ago and they still haven't posted to my wallet. I ain't even mad because my purchase price was $333 per coin. Even still, a week to get my coin is pushing it.

So you are factoring in Venezuelan inflation into the equation, where I think the OP was just discussing the absolute value of Bitcoin only.  I see your point.

If I were a bum, pretty much my only requirement for living in a town is that the ability to panhandle be legal.

You can buy one month of VPN service for $6.95 at  with Bitcoin.

I'd like to encrypt her if you guys know what I mean, nudge nudge, wink wink.

I nominate for user of the month. This thread should be linked to or Okay maybe not subreddit of the day, I don't want the poor guy to go broke. lol

Hey, thanks for the offer! I thought gox suspended withdrawals denominated in USD?
Did you guys close on your house yet?

Congrats! Are you going to have a house warming party or invite some family over to see it? hint hint
@_date: 2013-07-22 05:43:02
OK, so tell me a broker I can use in USD currently with reasonable fees?
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:23:28
Well, with all these 3rd parties and the shutting down/suspending transactions is frustrating. For bitcoin to really takeoff, there needs to be a more streamlined way to buy/sell somehow or people will really start to lose interest, imo.
@_date: 2013-07-13 06:52:31
How does the price of bitcoin fluctuate 30% between South American countries?? I thought bitcoin is uniformly priced across various brokers?

I'm sure it's gorgeous, I'm eager to check it out!

Facebook is a private company? Uh, u/zedlander I hate to break it to you, but they went public over a year [ago]( and is publicly traded on the Nasdaq exchange.
@_date: 2013-07-02 08:07:02
This is actually bearish for Bitcoin. Does anyone remember when the GLD and SLV etf's came out? It destroyed volume in the NYMEX pits of the actual physical gold and silver markets. Bitcoin could nosedive sharply. I'm a seller.

bitcoinkeychains.com. Says it all in the name, sold for $9.95.

Can someone tell me who the Managing Director or Bitcoin Co. Ltd. is?

I feel like a douche quoting Gordan Gekko but it's true,
"A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place".
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:08:52
Exactly right. If the largest broker in the world by a longshot isn't being forthcoming with information, this could be very bad for the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:01:37
Bitcoin is [le]terally our saving grace and is more valuable than oxygen in our lungs.

What the hell is "cold storage"?
@_date: 2013-07-02 17:06:15
That's a good point. But Bitcoin will need to be careful it doesn't become the tail on the dog to the etf fund. I am not sure Bitcoin could handle the weight of the bitcoin etf. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:03:59
30 days, loooooooooooool. The bitcoin market is **so accessible!** I guess I'll try the localbitcoin in person deal.
@_date: 2013-09-05 02:46:16
So Bitcoin is going to need their own AOL to bring it to the masses. I would rather invest in the company that does that than buying bitcoin
@_date: 2013-07-11 18:36:48
babbletees.com has some really cool tee shirt designs that accept bitcoin. The shirts are over $10, but under $20 each.

Are Americans able to use MT. Gox? I submitted my passport *and* proof of residency and they **still** denied me account verification. Bitcoin has to be the most inaccessible currency of all time. I also tried at Bitcoin Instant, but got a few questions wrong on the verification page and have to wait TWO WEEKS to try again. Fuck this currency.

Bitcoin has gone from $100 to $75 very quickly. You don't find the timing coincidental to the MtGox partial shutdown?
@_date: 2013-06-17 10:01:23
I'll try it, thanks.
@_date: 2013-09-05 02:30:03
These projections look great and all, but before this currency can take off, Joe Six Pack will need to be able to know how to buy and sell bitcoin on his own. Let's be realists, the only pole who know how to buy and sell these things are extremely computer savvy people. That's less than 1% of the population. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:58:02
So they could go on Silk Road to acquire their crack now.

Most expensive mid-rise rent in Old Town $3k/mo for 2BR. Whoever is paying $8k for a view downtown w and extra bedroom is an idiot and is overpaying by a lot.
