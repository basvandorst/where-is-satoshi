One tip I can give is do a bunch of reading on r/bitcoinmarkets. The discussion is far less biased and there's more talk about alt coins which you want to be looking in to if your plan is keep putting money in crypto.

The long post below is the answer you're looking for. These subreddits perspectives are so skewed it's ridiculous, so many people post opinions here as facts and the bulk of peoples perspective are fueled by emotions and the hive mind.
If you want to get into crypto do your research, not just on BTC but on all the coins and the economy in general. You might get lucky following the trends you read here but if you really want to make larger amounts of money you really need to educate yourself. If it's just 100 bucks or something go for it but if you really want to make profit put your time in.

At the moment,what is the most cost efficient way to buy bitcoin in Canada(vancouver specifically)? As far as I understand I can purchase through an A.T.M,a personal sale,or through a coin exchange like quadriga. Any thoughts? Thanks.

Read as much you can from multiple sources then make an informed decisions. The vast majority of posts on Reddit are speculation and hype and the answer to your question is far more complicated then any of the responses you're bound to get by outright asking.

As other have said,nobody knows. 90% of the answer you're going to get on this subreddit are people throwing out definitive statements when in reality they have very little understanding of the crypto market. You're better off doing the research and forming your own opinion.
