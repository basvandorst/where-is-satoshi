Dude me too. Great crypto hype man. He has been doing this for a long time and is very passionate.

Please explain this further if you could. Would they not have to replace the entire existing block chain to do this?? 
How exactly can someone be in the middle of using a true P2P transaction?
I could see it with custodial accounts but with a P2P transaction how would a person pull this off without me knowing? Fake addresses imported to users wallets?

Right on! Thanks I really appreciate it!

To fake a BTC transaction you would have to reconfigure the whole existing block and create an alternative block for the rest of the network to give consensus on. You would have to do this in the short period of time in between blocks(less than 10min) and remembering every single byte in the existing blocks must remain the same or it will not accepted so it would be nearly impossible to do. 
I’m not gonna say it can’t be done, I just don’t see how it could be done and accepted into the block in time. Maybe if it was done back in 2010 but now it’s basically impossible.

I’m done using banks guys. Well I’m trying. This is my first major start.

I wasn’t sure if the bitcoin community used a particular platform for it. 
I’m in Atlanta if anyone is interested.
