Not "most" in terms of today's distribution, more like 13%. But the point remains.

Satoshi said that fiat system "works well enough for most transactions" but reliance on trust adds cost and in turn makes "small casual payments" impossible. IMO there's a spirit of suggestion his solution could replace the whole system but he doesn't say that and I worry it's an unnecessary either/or.
Agree completely about his intention to aid the less wealthy, as the whitepaper specifically solves the problem of small payments.

Damn, you're right! I was remembering the 12 million number. The way the ICO unfolded the dev vs. total counts were confusing.

Well yeah we all assume that, but I'm not following your reasons. If etrade's CEO declared some currency was a fraud, wouldn't we all expect him to remove any instrument for it from etrade's service?
Let's face it, we assume nothing will come of this because nothing's come of JPM's record of repeated felony fraud, perjury, forgery, bribery, money laundering, etc, except some fines. 
More specifically all that came of JPM's last criminal currency manipulation conspiracy was a $550 million fine:
With 175 BTC-like patent attempts denied to JPM at this point, I imagine they're entertaining more aggressive measures. And with JPM's expertise in net-profitable financial felonies and $38 billion set aside for legal fees I'm sure Dimon's not worried.

Whether technically a crime or not, condemning something as fraud while profiting from it is at minimum deplorable, misleading, and smells of market manipulation. 
EU law seems to prohibit this behavior whether the disseminator knew, or should have known, info disseminated was misleading.
Formal accusations of market abuse have been filed against Dimon:

Knowing facilitation of a crime is still a crime.
Dimon is the one saying BTC is a scam. By his own definition then his organization is one of the top facilitators of said scam.

Name a government that has control of its currency.

You really think the dollar isn't the world's reserve currency? Yeah Bretton Woods ended officially but... just ask Sadam Hussein what happened when he tried to take OPEC off the dollar summer 2001...
And I'm not sure anyone can define what the FED is, but legally it's been ruled part private corporation

Sorry if I'm missing something... Now that BIP91 has forced BIP148, if we say 90% hash power leaves tomorrow, wouldn't it just slow down block production until difficulty readjusts 10 days later at most, with the 10% hashpower left then signaling at the same pace as now?

Ahhh right, thanks!
