I don't know where to start.

“When somebody with a strong brand and security level establishes it as a reliable service, then the whole industry will follow. That is my personal prediction.” - luckily that's already here, it's called Bitcoin.

I could tell by the way you were joking.
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:24:09
I like your style.

I suppose small steps are better than no steps :D

I tend to agree with all of this, except the chance that Coinbase and Bitpay won't obtain licenses. They will because if they do, it's very hard for someone else to come along and take their place. Unfortunately, this means that somewhat of a monopoly will arise and the fees won't be kept low.
Considering these higher fees, more people might be willing to ride the waves of volatility and we can reach our utopian closed Bitcoin economy a bit faster.

Do you mind if I submit this as part of my business banking application?

Humans have 10 fingers, the chose base ten. This is 10 multiplied by 10. It's obviously around 100! :P If humans had had 12 fingers then maybe he would have picked 144 instead.

Good stuff.

Most definitely, I have a German friend and he jokes the same way. Even your last comment was a joke. In fact almost everything they you say is a joke disguised so that non-German people don't suspect it as one.

Thank you!

Pretty pointless, they can just claim that they weren't sure about it's legality where iphones where used.

Round about now.

Trying to separate the blockchain from Bitcoin again. If you can't trust one, you can't trust any, Bitcoin is either going to dominate or the uncertainty in cryptocurrencies will be too high for anyone to get involved in any of them.
