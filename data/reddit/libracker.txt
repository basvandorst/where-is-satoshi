File was probably too big.

This might be a stupid question, but are you sure you set a password, and encrypted the wallet?  2.8.3 will let you proceed without either.

^^ This is a good answer, OP.  [How to recover from iCloud backup](
You might also have a backup on your computer if you set up iTunes to automatically back up your iPhone, but assuming 'Bither' encrypts your wallet and you say you don't know the recovery phrase, your only option would be to recover the whole iPhone backup to a different iPhone and hope it comes up being able to decrypt the wallet.
Failing that, you say your phone is broken - does it show up if you connect it to a computer running iTunes?  You might be able to use that to back it up then recover it to a working iPhone.

You can throttle / block protocols quite easily if they require particular ports, or if they try to hide over TCP 443 if they have a signature which can be detected using Deep Packet Inspection.  As technology advances the processing required for this is becoming less expensive.

So why deceitfully repeal it?
Someone clearly has an agenda.

You mean until the banks realise they can simply exploit the loss of Net Neutrality to get ISPs to block Bitcoin protocols and websites?
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:27:08
Serious question:  What is the plan for when the loss of Net Neutrality means that banks could effectively pressure ISPs to throttle or block Bitcoin protocols and sites?

Indeed, but a few issues.
Firstly, the technology is significantly more mature now.  Think early ‘airbrushing’ of propaganda photos, but now we have Photoshop.
Secondly, WHY are they being so underhanded?  Pushing it through during Thanksgiving?  ID theft used to post anti-neutrality votes?
There is most definitely something underhanded going on.
