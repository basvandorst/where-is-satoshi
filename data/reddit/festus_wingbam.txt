Seven days.
Watched "The Ring" last night.

I'll take a hat. Where do I order ?

Are you sure, because [this post] ( says otherwise. See answer from Pieter Wuille.
and also this reply from Andrew Chow:

I believe the expression is "strap in" :)

You understand that in the futures market, unlike securities, every long has a corresponding short position, right?
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:30:41
I'm open to that idea. But if I did this, what API could I use to connect to my node? The API I referenced in my original post ( is apparently dependent upon a product called "bitcoind." Is that different from the Bitcoin Core product you referenced?
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:52:27
Gotcha. The API looks pretty extensive but for some reason, there's no functionality to obtain TXs associated with an arbitrary address, like you can with BlockExplorer, Blockchain.info, Insight APIs, etc. Instead, their API appears to be very tightly coupled to user-defined "wallets." Unfortunately, the ability to query on an arbitrary address, whether or not it's part of my internal wallet, is something I really need.
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:25:48
Oh, so that's what you were talking about. It looks like adding this functionality requires a special patch? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:59:49
Thanks, guys. This is great info.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:30:26
Wow man, that looks pretty sweet! So it's not just an API that communicates with Bitcoin Core. It's a full-blown node written in C

The transaction fee is too low. Your transaction's fee is 87 satoshi/byte according to:
But as you can see at:
The optimal fee is currently 140 sat/byte for a transaction to clear in 0-35 minutes. By setting the fee to 87 sat/byte, you're looking at a wait time up to 180 minutes.
It'll confirm. You've just gotta give it a bit more time.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:16:54
I wish I knew. I'm surprised that the sender is an exchange. They typically set their fees correctly. Ticks me off. I think the 250 rate was actually acceptable at or around the time we made our transfers but then for whatever reason, all of a sudden, 250 became unacceptable. If you look at:
...you'll see that transaction with a fee rate of 265 (like yours) are taking up to 29 hours to clear. 
The fees and confirmation delays are a killer. :(
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:59:51
Mine too. Still waiting for two transactions to clear that've been in the queue since the 24th. I don't project a very bright future for BTC if they can't get this high fee / long delay issue resolved.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:31:24
Thanks. This is exactly what I'll do. I just wish there were a helpful document, analogous to the one I linked to above, that describes the bitcoin transaction format, including SegWit indicators, in detail. It would make the transition a lot easier.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:26:06
Yeah, it's pretty crazy. More exchanges are allowing users to choose their own transaction fee these days, for exactly that reason. To avoid this problem in the future, I'm always going to set my fee manually using  as a guideline.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:37:16
Looks like it finally confirmed but took 176 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:05:30
Oh hey, your tx finally went through. One of mine just confirmed after 58 hours :( Just one left...
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:07:38
Mine have been in the queue for even longer:
You and I made the same mistake of sending our transactions with a fee rate of around 250 sat/byte. Apparently 500 is the new normal. What ticks me off the most though is that Electrum is supposed to automatically detect the optimal fee rate (if configured to do so in Settings, which mine is) and it totally screwed this up by setting the fee too low. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:53:35
Exactly. I wish more people had that mindset. This whole thing is just a game.
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:27:01
Oh yeah, Ozark is great! Looking forward to the next season.

Not dead but definitely crippled; not unlike Walt Jr. from "Breaking Bad."
It's been a fun ride, and I stuck around this long (since early 2015) naively believing BTC could become a fiat alternative, but the extreme volatility clearly makes that impossible. 
It's nothing more than a highly manipulated speculative asset for day-traders at this point. 
I'm happy I made some money but don't see the price settling into any kind of equilibrium any time soon. Might be time to cash out?
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:05:43
I agree BCash is obsolete but I own a ton of it due to the fork back in August? What did you do with yours? Swap it for BTC? I feel like I've gotta unload this BCH before people realize it has no future.
I've asked this question before on this forum but my post always gets deleted because it doesn't mention Bitcoin enough. Maybe I'll have better luck in this comment section.

"eustan: Me prefers not to be molested with this same stupid question on a daily basis"
...and yet here you are, responding to the "stupid" question. 
(1) Just an FYI... It's pretty clear that the only reason you injected your reply into this discussion is because you enjoy using the term "molested." Seek help -- but preferably not on this forum.
(2) Could you add some value by pointing me to all of the "daily" posts on this topic that you claim are flooding this forum?
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:36:19
Thanks, friend. This is good feedback.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:24:17
Gotcha. So if I understand your analogy correctly, you're advising to use a quoting convention that's appropriate for the given context; No need to decide on some single, arbitrary app-wide unit of measurement. That does make sense.
