Close, *mininum std. deviation* (volatility) or if  you are comparing bitcoins to other equities, bitcoins Beta risk (bitcoins risk of market movements).  Besides Gold, bitcoin is one of the few things i have found that have close to 0 correlation (move independent) of the market...which is a good thing.

exactly.... someone is pumping alot of money into the market...and as i type...the price approaches 71.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:51:10
Yes. They can make larger spreads essentially.

Just switched. Waiting for bitcoins to show up into blockchain.  Plus i don't know i didn't use blockchain to begin with...so many more security features besides just two-factor authentication.

The buy price and sell price is different.  In this market, the sell price is lower than the buy price.  The difference is called the spread, which is the profit mtgox makes for "making the market".  When you have large volatility swings like today, the spread gets larger and larger.

MTGOX is making a killing off these spreads.

I am doing a master's paper on bitcoins in my time-series analysis class trying to figure out what moves bitcoin price using an GARCH/EGARCH model.  Not sure if you would be interested in talking about it, but it is interesting to note that USD/BTC does not follow a "random-walk", like most stocks and currencies.

Good points.  Mind you, this paper was done last spring, so it does not take into considerations recent price movements.  It would be interesting to use updated data.  I would suggest no news equals less volatility in the markets.  One of the papers i cited in my paper showed this (bits to bets if i remember correctly).

Yeah it does, but I just want to use my story as a reminder to the community to keep a cold wallet and encrypt any hot wallets they may have on their comps.  Money is money and I have an ok job.  This weekend has just sucked howver

Whats fucked up is MTGOX lagging almost 5 mins.  We seriously need a more efficient exchange. 
EDIT: I sold 3 bitcoins at 68...feel bad doing it now. I am of little faith :( unless i can cancel a pending transaction with coinbase?

MS in Econ and Finance.  Its called exchange arbitrage.

Yeah i can do that pretty easily (often talk with girlfriend who has zero business/statistics background about it and she seems to get most of it.)  Essentially, you can look at past weeks prices of bitcoin and measure the effect they have on today's prices.  Additionally, you can look at the shocks or error term of an estimated equation for bitcoins, and see that when positive news or "good shocks" are happening, the market reacts more intensely then when bad news or "bad shocks" is observed.  Essentially the market for bitcoin is still bullish (greatly so if you look at the actual coefficients).  There's more interesting data as well (such as the effect of cyprus situation on the price, the FINCEN report on regulation, and a few others), right now i am still finishing the estimation and conclusion stage of the paper, but there are some interesting things to show that bitcoins is nowhere near an "equilibrium" price, which can only mean greater price potentials for bitcoin.
