Can't tell if you're joking, or if you don't realize that BCC = BCH.

Can you give me some examples? 
Of course, other VPN's use LeaseWeb, but what makes you think the MAJORITY of VPN's use LeaseWeb?
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:18:55
ProtonVPN, most likely. Majority of the servers used for their VPN are from LeaseWeb.

So what you're saying is, you go on Reddit to insert your opinion into every single topic you come across, whether or not you have anything useful to contribute?
May I suggest another hobby? Perhaps one that involves bettering yourself or others around you.

RTFL: Read The Fucking Law
Their T&amp;C's don't supersede EU data protection laws. They specifically included provisions that block companies from trying to claim "The user accepted x, y and z when they signed up for an account."
The LBC shills are out in full force tonight.

Wrong. The EU Data Protection Directive has been in effect since 1995, and still remains in effect to this day. 
The updated (and more stringent) privacy plan, known as the General Data Protection Regulation was officially adopted in April of 2016, and will supersede the original Data Protection Direction. 
May 25, 2018 was a date set by the EC to give businesses a grace period to update their policies, before they start getting fined and penalized.

Then don't reply. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:08:03
Agree with everything you said, but let's not compare LBC to financial institution like a bank. 
They're not even properly licensed as a money transmitter or currency exchange platform, which is why they've been forced to cease business in multiple regions and countries.
Therefore, they can't make the argument that they're required by law to keep financial data on file.
What really worries me is that they used to have the option for users to delete their accounts right from their User Settings.
So, why remove it? Why fight back and give vague responses when users request that their accounts be deleted?

You want another guy to suck your dick? Looks like we just found you a hobby! 
I knew there had to be something else in this world that you enjoyed other than shitposting. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:15:14
I don't wish to use their service anymore, hence why I requested that they delete my account, and all personal info attached to it.
Being that LBC is headquartered in the EU, they have a legal responsibility to honor my request.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:36:40
Uh, no. You have a right to request deletion, and under current EU law, the business is obligated to comply with the request.

If you don't know what you're talking about, please refrain from posting. Do some research on the EU Data Protection Laws. Even the biggest companies like FB and Google have been forced to comply with the privacy guidelines set by EU.

This statement surely won't come back to bite you in the ass...
Ignorance runs deep with this one.
