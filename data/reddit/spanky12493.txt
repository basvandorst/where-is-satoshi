why is everyone on reddit like this, no one can clear up a misunderstanding, just random insults. How do people do this and have no perspective. god forbid you disagree with someone and ask a question.
Next comment will be something like: "youre incapable of understanding" or "bro, seriously you should seek help"
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:18:45
If you dont believe something just because its on a webpage why did you cite it? Do you also believe they are lying about their FDIC insurance on USD? You have no clear point, either you think coinbase is just blatantly lying and has no insurance, or you think its not reliable insurance. And Now you've realized you cant prove they have no insurance on coins like you initially thought so you are just saying "well its a lie cause its a webpage, and webpages can lie about stuff"
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:36:11
uh you lost 80k if that happens. why do people act as if profits aren't real money. that 80k is real money, it's your money. Maybe you will get more, maybe less. But you currently have 80k of value in btc that you can lose.

i dont understand what the conspiracy is here, do people think the money being spent on tether is being spent?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:50:19
sure, thats a somewhat irrelavant point though. We are talking about the mentality that once you have taken out your principle investment that the rest is just "house money" and if it all goes to 0 then you didnt lose anything. Its just mental gymnastics for people to accept higher risk. you took out your principle you can take out the rest, just because you made back your investment doesnt mean nothing is lost. money is money vlaue is value. your btc is yours, if it goes down you are losing if it goes up you are gaining. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:36:20
sure but none of them are as good or reliable as gdax. Not to mention gdax probably handles 90% of us btc exchange. Segwit or not gdax is far and away the best exchange for us buyers/sellers.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:56:02
Gdax has little or no fees, so it's the best way to do it. What you should do is attatch your bank and deposit money into gdax. Gdax is just the exchange for coinbase, so u already have a gdax account when u register at coinbase.
Whether to keep them in your account or transfer to a wallet is up to you. If u want to just hold them for a while, wallet is safest. But if u always want to be able to sell quickly u should keep them in gdax

The whole "house money" thinking is so stupid. Money is money, there is no difference from your money and house money, a dollar is a dollar. losing house money is no different from losing earned money. House money is just mental trick for investors to justify taking excessive risk they wouldn't normally take.

if its a limit buy then it should have executed even if it dropped fast. likely just not updated ur account yet.

People seek volatility, it's how you make the most money. Comparing btc to a Roth IRA doesn't make sense, ones low risk low return, ones high risk high return.

they can ban every single exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:53:43
is this how you handle everyone you disagree with? I understand you think I'm saying bullshit, you dont need to keep spamming that. I think people talking about "house money" is bullshit but i dont just spam "you wanna fuck off with your bullshit?" If you dont want to discuss or argue it or dont care and just want to spam random fuck offs and other dramatic insults thats fine, I was just replying on the off chance you were interested.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:37:02
i mean btc just cant handle this volume, so until the tech improves or the volume slows down you will see these insane fees.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:46:16
Yeah no one knows Roger is bch
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:30:16
I mean USD is FDIC insured just like any other major bank. Sure you could argue if coinbase goes under it might take a while to be settled, but your money in coinbase is just as secure as it is in any other bank. FDIC insurance is no joke.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:48:20
No more than that, I can't give an exact number, but maybe more than 19.9%
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:13:02
Well it's not a currency
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:12:41
them supporting segwit has nothing to do with how good their platform is. they are more secure than any other exchange, they have high liquidity, they are more reliable than any other exchange, they have lower fees than any other exchange, usd is fdic insured on their exchange. The gdax platform is just unrivaled in the US.
You are making an ideological argument because you want segwit and they haven't supported it yet. Ok sure, you can argue that, but you should be very clear this suggestion to use other exchanges is soley due to your position on segwit support. Not because any exchange is safer or functions better. It's alos strange to suggest other exchanges that you have no idea how they work. I have used every exchange available to us customers, if you want lowest fees, best service, and the best security, use gdax. If you only care about supporting segwit, fine go ahead and use something else.

what? No. Maybe I dont understand what you are asking.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:36:45
why are you derailing the argument? Either its insured or its not, you cited text to prove your point, then he cited text to prove your point wrong, but now suddenly the text doesn't matter because its possible they are lying. Why dont you just admit you were wrong about it then argue you just dont trust the insurance. I blows my mind how incapable people are of conceding a single point.

Why are you trying to define companies as good or eveil, every company is trying to maximize their profits, that's their whole job. Just because some companies business plan happens to help you doesn't make them good, they aren't doing it to help you, they are doing it because they believe it will help their company.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:47:07
It does, it's the main us exchange. If you're in the us don't use anything but gdax/coinbase

usd is fdic insured, but not coins

@_date: 2017-12-21 01:42:43
Yeah it's not about winning an argument it's just about making sure everyone is posting truthful information. You literally said its not insured and tried to cite it. I don't see the semantic argument there. And admitting you missed something doesn't make your overall point wrong. It just make your specific point wrong.
You can go around saying they are not insured, but its just obviously wrong. You should be going around saying not to trust their insurance, if that's what you point is. I dont see why you are being so dramatic, it just an objective discussion of the situation on coinbase, why is everything here so emotional.

It's still your money. Right now you have a choice of having 5k in your bank account or risking 5k in btc. Just because u didn't work for the money doesn't mean it's not yours. That's why people take profits, to keep the amount they have at risk an amount they are ok with losing, even as it grows. 
Money is money, the 5k you risk in btc is no different than the 5k you earn at your job in your bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:06:20
i know u said its a ridiculous question, but he hasn't been proven wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:08:45
If u don't care about losing 5 grand then u don't need to take profits because it means ur initial investment was way way below what u are ok with losing. But for most people in btc they started with an amount they were ok losing and it has grown into an amount they are not ok losing. Maybe they started with 5k but now it's worth 40k. Those people investment is no longer the 5k they were ok with losing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:59:16
I dont understand why you are so dramatic, you can just point out where I am wrong without acting like your first born child died. There is no awe inspiring logic, just that you shouldn't separate house money from other money.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:35:31
Then your current life situation has changed to where you you are now ok losing 5k. The point is most people's investment has grown to a value they are not ok losing. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:05:07
ok so you are ok losing the 5k, thats all im saying.

After how long and when?


yes like i said befor thats a risk, but youre not risking losing money, you are risking how long payout takes in the event of coinbase going under.


Yes FDIC insurance is up to to 250k, just like almost every single bank.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:18:20
Use gdax
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:03:19
yeah but not at 3%, the cost isnt directly passed on to the consumer. They choose to accept credit cards because it brings more business making them more profitable, making the extra cost worth it, not because they just raise prices 3%

no one likes the mods, I think most would agree they abuse their power and censor (a funny irony considering this is a bitcoin subreddit). But honestly fits my viewpoint the best so I am not gonna jump ship just to protest, the community here is still good despite the mods best efforts.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:34:58
Not really, coinbase is historically incredibly stable, been using them for a year now, made hundred of trades on gdax, it's really a very stable service, especially considering the shit show that is every other exchange.

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:41:24
theres not any math to discuss here. either you try to sell a dip and rebuy befor it goes back up, or you hold and hope it keeps going up. It make 0 deifference when you bought your coins or for how much.
1 btc is one btc, it doesn't make any difference when you bought it. All you want to do is try to play the market, which lots of people do everyday, the age of your coins is irrelavant. But yes, if you can successfully sell high then you buy lower, obviously you make money. (or avoid losing money)
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:32:58
yeah, but i mean do your really need to know jack shit to be in crypto? just buy it and your done.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:02:16
Yes, fixed supply is permanent, high demand isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:32:42
sure but i dont pay credit card fees when i make transactions. anyway im not arguing against btc, just strange someone has no issue with a 3% fee just because its no a 10% fee.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:46:05
Why is it bad? It seems like widespread use and understanding is a good thing, if it works for other things to buy ad time why not btc?
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:56:15
sure but most people cannot do this unless you want zimbabwe dollars, which no one wants, which is why the volume on this exchange is so low.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:59:02
(btc price) x (amount of btc sold) - (btc price) x (amount of btc bought) 
I mean all your doing is calcaulating what you spent vs what you sold for.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:09:38
Ok you don't have to, I'm just not sure what your choice is, if you are not able to sell on gdax your not able to sell anywhere. Gdax isn't the nasdaq, it's comparable to other online exchange services like etrade, Robinhood, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:55:01
yes, not many sane people are willing to accept zimb dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:14:23
at least gdax is a practical functioning exchange with volume. It's not a wallet, its meant to buy and sell, not hold. For buying and selling btc there is not a better place; 0 fees, high volume, reliable. buy your btc put it in your wallet, when you want to sell move it back and sell.
Gdax has really fucked me over the years with 0 fees, instant trades, and fast withdraws. But hey I guess I could always buy the 0.11 btc on the highly recommended bitsquare exchange for 11 thousand dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:14:37
yeah they certainly exist, and then i can choose if i want convenience or a discount. But I get your point, I guess im jsut used to services like venmo or something that has no fees to move money around between people.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:31:25
No one knows, some people waited for a crash at 9k then 3 days later it's 11k. I bought at 5k then three days later it's 3.5k. no one in this subreddit knows, 99% of us just bought it and hodl it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:56:29
It was down for 5 min. Didn't go down at all through 9k or 10k Spike. Etrade is a major financial service and sometimes holds my trades for hours during spikes and crashes. You just happen to have you first experience now but coinbase has been around for years as the most reliable servcie and gdax has been up for every Spike and crash untill 20 min ago.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:57:20
thats not arbitrage

why not just show him the btc price instead of wasting money on a status symbol rolex
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:19:45
I think the merchant is eating a lot of the discount yes, I dont think its being passed directly onto the consumer, them accepting credit cards is a way to expand their business.
But I think your generally right, I sincerly didnt understand how high fees were, my main tool for sending and receiving money between people digitally is venmo which has no fees, or credit/debt where i dont see the fee, or eat the whole fee.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:56:06

@_date: 2017-11-14 01:30:52
not to me, the consumer doesnt spend 3% on every credit transaction. im the one paying the fee on sending btc.

@_date: 2017-09-26 21:30:15
so when is bitcoin going to rise or drop?
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:27:14
because it becomes the main coin, both that people are mining and trading. I mean I am all for btc over 2x but if all exchanges and miners adopt 2x that will give it value. If the market decides 2x is a better product than classic btc, 2x will be valuable.
