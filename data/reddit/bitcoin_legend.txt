It doesn't matter what experts say.  Remember, these experts were the reason Bitcoin was invented in the first place - to get away from them.  Have your own thoughts about what any cryptocurrency is worth to you.  Think for yourself and you will profit.  Hop on the bandwagon and you will not.

And yet she became alpha widow afterwards and probably never shut the fuck up about him.  Interesting.

You may be right, buy my ex left me a few years ago because I wasn't earning enough money.  She didn't literally tell me that, but that was the writing on the wall.  Since then I've been really struggling with this.  Women care about money whether I do or not.

The stability of those assets is an illusion.  Drink up if you wish...the ambrosia of capitalism is fattening the pigs for a coming slaughter, or at least, unusual continuation of class warfare.  Massive inflation of the dollar is on the table and none of us have experienced this so we won't know what the warning signs will be - we assume stability because it's all we've experienced, but it's the same in any country anywhere, the past is not an accurate prediction of the future.  How many countries that have come into existence have eventually failed?  Rhetorical question, of course: all of them, and some are in the current process of failing.  Stability is *not normal* but it has been *normalized* in our minds.
Satoshi himself knew this, I believe that fucking genius created this protocol as a method to save the weird thinking-first nerds before that system ends itself with greed.  I've been watching for a long time...

Not entirely, unfortunately, but it's only one exchange and it'll likely not affect prices more than 5-10%.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:14:55
I really don't think it will be the only cryptocurrency.  I think if it can't be used in some cases because it's not stable enough, others will fit the bill for that.  It'll be a full menu of different crypto for different purposes, similar to already-existing differentiation among protocols for different purposes on the internet today.

It's alright, you can laugh, I don't mind.  I've faced far worse than that.  Good luck to you friend!

I missed the dotcom boom, son, and I felt the same way.  You have no idea how common this feeling is.  There will be more opportunities.  Never keep your head down for too long, keep learning.
Fear of loss or fear of missing out.  It's always one or the other, no matter the market.

Thanks dude, yeah, I got out a few months ago.  I don't think it'll ever be 100%, but that reminds me I need to lift now, with focus on form.  Best of luck to you, thanks for slowing down to chat for a bit.  I genuinely hope everyone currently in this subreddit forms part of a new world order and that we fucking kill banks.  That's my personal dream, at least right now, as crazy as it sounds.  A lot of other terrible shit will happen in the middle, most likely, if it does occur, though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:14:34
Don't you wish you could be happy for *them*, though?  A frustrating feeling of success.

Truth.  Ready yourselves for thinking on your own, folks!
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:33:20
Fucking awesome!  It's a good feeling, isn't it?
After buying bitcoin six years ago, my wallet at one point earned more USD equivalent in a single good day than I ever made with a conventional job in a year.  
I've watched in disbelief as I earn more USD equivalent in a year than I ever made in the rest of my life.  
I've made more in the entirety of this six years than anyone else I know.  I didn't even try.  I have always outwardly hated money.  Always.  I know it changes people, or at least, changes how people interact.
I don't know many wealthy people (and nor do I really want to, I think moneythink, even if I "have it", is the root of all current planetary evil - mindless addiction towards an endless hunger).
The true cost?  Pushing most of the people I loved in my life away because of erosion of trust.  Good stuff.  *sigh*  Now I can never trust, even if they come back or new ones show up, because the wealth situation is very different.  Money doesn't fix everything, folks.  I know it looks brighter on the other side of this tunnel, but the victory is truly bittersweet when you hate yourself inside.
**Be careful what you wish for.**

Very sorry, brother.  I too dealt with ex hell, though mine was in the midst of fortune-building, which is almost worse.  It really wrecks motivation to ever find another mate when you see just how selfish those female humans are capable of becoming, especially in terms of money entitlement.  They're so **desperate**, even if they're cheating!  What's yours is also hers, but what's hers is not yours!  This was my experience, at least.  lol.  Oh well, she spent a few of my coins, and even the last laugh with this girl was bittersweet because she was actually good to me for many years before the end.

Think of the existing system collapsing first under the weight of its own unsustainable greed.  Some of us were alive and adults and paying full attention in 2008, the year before the birth of this movement.  The core is still important.  Do not forget that Occupy Wall St. failed, but Bitcoin may yet succeed.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:11:02
Indeed.  It will go down after this bubble.  Then it will go back up again.  But we'll need to be patient, and endure the pain of watching a valuation drop.  When you're balls deep in Bitcoin, boy does it get paradoxically easier.  That's the biggest surprise of all.  I've seen four of these bubbles, but this one will hurt the most when it bursts because now I don't have a job anymore, lol.  I'll just keep living off of ramen though, it's a simple, spartan, single man's life for me.

Because those things you mentioned are no longer going to be (easily) possible once EROEI (petroleum/energy sector) problems start really hitting us.  The petrodollar's grip is very strong, but our entire economy is extremely tied to the existence of affordable plastics, fertilizers, diesel, gas, and petrol.  Once that goes away, most of us will perish, as will our dollar.  We have no other way of life constructed but this one (not true for homesteaders, ranchers, farmers, and a few other groups of folks, which is why young people are getting into this shit again, but not as a fad like it was for the hippies).
Here's hoping you can buy carrots and onions at your local cryptocurrency farmer's market in a few years.

I tried too.  None of my friends or family listened, now they're all kicking themselves and I'm sad for them too.  Instead, on the way up, they'd remind me that it's still "not real money" at $100k, $500k, etc.  I don't even have that much, but it's enough to not work anymore, which is all I ever really wanted anyways.  I'm happy with a humble existence and don't need a Tesla/lambo regardless of whether I can afford that shit or not.
I fucking tried, guys.  I did my best and made all the most logical points I could, but something, perhaps fear, held them back.  I told them they were putting money on encryption, and asked if it had ever failed them before, they all went silent because they understood that argument...still didn't work.  You can lead people to water, but if they don't drink...

Thank you, kickass advice and I've bumped into this concept before but it wasn't called this.  Impressive stuff, and very interesting.  I **really** appreciate that tip and I'll use it!

Life will beat you into shape eventually if you're not.  With great power comes great responsibility...or loss of power.
