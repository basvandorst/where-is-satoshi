Thanks for all replies.
I'm in USA
I do not know how much I'd like to buy, probably a couple for now.
I can use paypal, and credit card.
Not very quickly but within a day.
Not so much, I just wanted to skip the "extra" step with mtgox. That said I still do value privacy a lot.

The wallet was not encrypted. I registered there but I can't pm yet, thank you I will look into this.

every time I open the bitcoin client it goes from 94% to 98% in the course of some 4 hours, then I shut it down and it's back down again. So annoying.

Do you mean that while mining it only uses idle cpu, so they won't notice (except that their cpu is at 100%)?

I'm aware of what could happen and I thank you for your concern, but I reformatted months ago and promptly recovered it. I ran bitcoin but then when it downloaded the blockchain I said fuck it and quit bitcoin before it finished. Fast forward months later, here I am. All I recovered was "wallet.dat", going to try the above method. Thanks.

But wasn't the comment you replied to talking about steam? I'm sorry, it's too early for thinking. I'm tired.
Edit: Oh.

You would have to match it and be over. Highly unlikely.

Yeah I hate paypal. I've used virwox before and fuck that, you have to wait 30 days before moving $30 (in my experience). 
I'll probably use bitinstant or bitfloor then thanks.

Thanks man, I will certainly use an online storage from now on.

mined about a total for 0.00, after 20 hours. so none.
@_date: 2011-11-30 02:02:11
Yes I was. How would you connect 20 computers to mine for you in a pool?

Please tell [r/tf2trade]( as well, reddit's tf2 trading server.

I agree with the rule. On other forums where they don't have this rule, the entire forum turns into a really shitty "here's my address, anyone mind sparing some btc? :)" and the community just dies.

Time to make a fork with a time long enough that you can mine anywhere in the solarsystem. Spacecoin.
