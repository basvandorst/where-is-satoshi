Sometimes things go down sometimes BCH go up. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:35:56
Lol. Should have known when it hit $1000. Thats sales call. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:39:32
Just replace the screen. Get one from ebay for $20-40. And diy the shit out of your tab. And get your coin, they will be all grown up. They grow fast you know. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:06:02
Pay for the replacement lcd. You should still be left with more than what you invested.

You just saw B. I see Bit.

HODL. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:41:58
Wish I could buy more. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:37:28
Exactly. The miners are playing with BCH. Stay away from it. As far as you can be. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:17:17
Requires nuclear proof hazmat suit just to go near it. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:41:33
Yeah. Thats what I thought. Freaky BCH.

By looking at social media posts people do have invested huge savings on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:32:49
Yes. Many of the popular sites are known to having the mining script on their page. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:50:42
Investing over different peaks will yield different profit. Depends if you can hit the dips.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:14:37
If Bitcoin hits $80k, which may take a while, your $50 will become $500, $200 will become $2000 and $1000 will become $10000. Just saying. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:46:53
But what about those who has invested more in pure speculation that Bitcoin will only go one direction. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:21:45
If so, he is a legend. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:36:13
There is always a likelihood of happening with Bitcoin. Seeing the way its going up it wont take much for people to panic. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:01:00
Interestingly most of it was mined and never used. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:04:14
$5k was the sodl position. Everyone should have known that. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:53:49
Dollaroos would be more appropriate.

@_date: 2017-09-14 23:25:27
Wouldn't you buy tho?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:26:02
Will it get sub $2000? Thats bit ambitious. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:43:11
I believe its not taxed what you make everytime trading. But accumulative annual money that you cash out from the exchange assuming thats the profit. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:20:43
And here I thought people don't want to reveal their mining location. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:21:08

Once upon a time there was a boy named Grant Kelly. He used to go by the alias gkelly. He got involved in mining bitcoin early on. He was successful in mining 7000+ bitcoins which he stored in his wallet. He used his laptop to mine them. After a while summer came and it was too hot for him to handle both his wife and the mining laptop. Thats when he decided to choose his wife and stopped mining with his laptop. Days went by and his laptop was got too depressed to live and finally left this world. Although he died his organs were salvaged by glelly. He stored the HDD which stored his wallet which stored his bitcoins. And few years later without realising, he was losing millions of todays bitcoin worth, he dumped his hdd in the bin. And by the time he realised how much he fucked up the poor HDD, which stored his wallet which stored the bitcoins, was already buried 7feet under all other discarded rubbish. Thats the story how gkelly murdered those many bitcoins with no trace of the incident except the blockchain which stores the information on that poor soul. And legend says it still haunts people visiting the pile of garbage looking for treasure. 
And thats the story. Hope you enjoyed it.

They were illegal to run an exchange from long ago. Only recently someone was actually arrested for illegal trading.

The only thing miners care about is profit. Not tomorrow's not in 10 yrs. current mining profit. So they will point their miners to whatever sha256 is profitable. Remember when BItcoinCash profitability was bit higher than Bitcoin everyone jumped ship. So for Bitcoin to remain Strong it needs miners. The more the miners are on any coin the stronger and secure it becomes. So you can hold all you want but at the end of the day profitability is what makes the coin survive. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:18:07
The ones mining at loss were Bitmain. They are strong supporter of BCash. Thats the the reason this batch of S9s payment is only BCash. And the reason not all moved to Bcash mining was they didn't calculated the profitability with BCash or maybe they are true supporter of Bitcoin. IMO Bitcoin should be the one. We should always support Bitcoin.

$20 movement is very insignificant with Bitcoin. You must be new to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:32:33
The main difference is FIAT money is controlled by banks whereas Cryptos are decentralised.
