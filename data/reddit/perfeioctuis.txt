Consumers are buying it as a potential store of value that they can spend.

It makes sense to use it as a currency since it enables instant worldwide transactions to anyone you want at an instant. It makes sense to use it as a longterm currency since it has a predictable inflation.

How about billions who are blocked from services and online trade because they live in the wrong country and those billions with no bank account.
How about the potential to reach the whole world as customer base?
"If you’re already using Bitcoin you’ll find this payment method even easier than paying by credit card."
"PayPal alone blocks access from over 60 countries, and many credit card companies have similar restrictions. Some are blocked for political reasons, some because of higher fraud rates, and some for other financial reasons."
"Bitcoin has no central authority and no way to lock entire countries out of the network."
How about not worrying about chargebacks?
From the merchant's point of view, if you do not prove the transaction to be legitimate, the bank will take back the entire value of the transaction from your account, along with an additional fee. This chargeback fee will range from $0 to $100, depending on the merchant bank sponsoring your
And friendly fraud.
"One of the biggest challenges facing ecommerce and card not present merchants in today’s credit card processing environment is the steady rise of “Friendly Fraud.”, also known as the “I didn’t do it” or “It wasn’t me” chargeback. Friendly fraud occurs when a cardholder makes a legitimate purchase either online or over the phone, receives the goods or services, and then decides to chargeback the sale claiming that they did not authorize the transaction. Cardholders do this for a variety of reasons: to get something for nothing, to reduce their account balance, or because they can’t make the minimum payment on the credit card at the end of the month. Over time, issuing banks have made the chargeback process easier and easier for their cardholders, leading to greater and greater instances of friendly fraud."
Or not worrying that inflation will eat your pension away?

And in the end they will be weeded out, when they will sell their coins to those that can.

Well it only requires 700.000 new users per year each getting 2 coins on average. That is less than 2000 new users per day. 
Less than a million new users per year which is not a very high growth.
If two coins sounds much, consider that they do not have to get them both at the same time. 
But two coins in total in a year, that is 0.16 coins a month or $51 a month.
 
They do not have to be new users either. 
As old users are also buying, even less than 2000 new users.
In reality even less are required as the coins mined are spread out and many miners also hold on to some of the coins.
So lets say 1800 new users per day for a price of $320.
Nr of new Mywallet accounts are around 3500 per day.
Coinbase also appears to grow with around 3300 new accounts per day.
A total of 6800 new wallets per day. 
More than three times the 2000 2 coins each, users, on top of that there are those who sold high and are now buying back in.
