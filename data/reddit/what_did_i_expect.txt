How old are you kid, and where did you get the money from?
You do realize that you're losing money anyway right? You're better off buying a GPU and doing some altcoin mining. At least you can use the GPU for gaming even if the mining adventure flounders.

Nice one tough guy
Let's see how you go cowboy trying to fire off at point blank range as a big nig lurches into you with a knife in the firm grip of a tightened fist
If you're going to be handing over or receiving money, you're going to be getting up close and that could be his perfect opportunity to either to pack some momentum into you with a fist or a knife, or worse, take your gun if he can see it.
BTW, when you get robbed/bashed, you typically don't get 'threatened' first - why would an attacker give away what he's about to do, giving you a chance to act and defend yourself? You get attacked without warning.

Hi, I'm Jamal Babatundé. Wanna meet up in the alley across from King Street? Just make sure you don't forget to bring the $2k if you want the Bitcoins man.

You'd be surprised at what lengths some people will go to in order to acquire money, especially if they have an addiction of some kind they must fulfil.
A naïve white boy/neckbeard who you can be sure is carrying around thousands of dollars in cold hard cash is about as easy a target as you can get

He can play with scryptcoins with his existing hardware if he wants the 'educational value'
Not that there's much educational value in it anyway. Looks like this guy just plugged a pre-built machine in, and ran a pre-made program for it. What's learned?
At least with altcoins you have to learn to make your own short script.

Just a suggestion, if he's into mining - it's the same thing, only different algorithm. Never met anyone excited by losing money.
