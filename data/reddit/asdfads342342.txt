3pence is right, it wouldn't be that hard at all.. you could probably use the square scanner with some new phone software. 
The real question though is what's the point? as far as I can see there is none. 
The cards wouldn't work with any existing card infrastructure just the people running your special phone app - and what's the benefit over NFC or QR code phone payments? you need a card? that sounds like more of a drawback than a feature.
edit: actually there is one reason this might be a good idea; smart cards could be the ideal storage medium for secure offline bitcoins.

I think smartcard bitcoin storage may well happen as it does have some benefits.. private keys could be generated on the card or written to a couple of cards and then destroyed.. once that's done there's no way to get the keys off but you could make transactions through the cards using a pin number. An external card reader with a pinpad and a smartcard bitcoin storage would be great on the desktop - you nolonger have to worry about your desktop being trojaned since you have to approve all payments on the external smartcard pin terminal. I'm not sure if there are any smartcards that support ECC keys yet though..
Using a magstrip card is probably a terrible idea though.. you could store the private key there but it would be vulnerable to being copied whenever the card is swiped.
