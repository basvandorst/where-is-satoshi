The early investors who put in a few dollars haven't made insane amounts of money. The people who have done really well put in amounts like $100k, and most of them sold on the way up. For example, they bought 100k coins at $1, and then sold half of those at $10, and then the rest at $100. That's over $4M, but they're mostly out of the market now, and that's not an unreasonable gain considering that they had to put in $100k -- and if Bitcoin didn't pan out, they could've have lost it all.
Bitcoin is far less risky today. You're still welcome to put in $100k right now. It's less likely to go to zero now, but I would not be surprised to see that $100k become $4M or more within the next 10 years.

One of the issues with BTC is the fact that not everyone has some. When I walk down the street and talk with normal people, at least 19 out of 20 don't have any bitcoin whatsoever, not even 0.001. With this new digital currency, everyone will have some. They'll all have an equal amount, and if they haven't claimed theirs yet, they can just log on and get it.
Another idea is to make the distribution a regular payment, e.g. 5,000 units per month. That way, you get rewarded for joining early, but you don't lose much if you join later.

BitPay should start using mBTC instead. 0.0028 does not feel sensible to most people, but 2.8 mBTC would work well.

I haven't created anything yet, so you're right about that. This is an early-stage idea that's still in development; what makes you think it doesn't exist?

Yes, it's probably correct if each address were a user, but that's definitely not the case. A centralized company like Coinbase might be able to do a better estimate, or we could guess based on deeper and more sophisticated blockchain analysis.

Assuming you have dollars: buy BTC, then use those BTC to buy from Tiger Direct with bitcoin. Problem solved

I recommend using mɃ because it's shorter and thus looks nicer.
35 mɃ
78 mɃ
134 mɃ

The answer is "You cannot." Anyone trusting bitcoin with money that they can't afford to lose is a fool, and any honest and knowledgeable bitcoiner will tell you the same. I'm a bitcoin enthusiast, early adopter, and work full-time at a bitcoin company. Even if you secured the bitcoin successfully, the value of a bitcoin is still in flux and in 24 hours, could be worth 10X more or less than it is now.

Among adult Facebook users, the average number of friends is 338. For people who signed up for Facebook while in college, they could add only their very best friends and still reach 300. I do *not* add "any person i meet", and over the past 9 years (I joined Facebook in 2005), I've accumulated well over 1,000 friends.
Thanks for pointing this out, though. We're definitely considering what the actual requirements should be, and the minimum-friends limit could certainly be a little lower.

due to privacy concerns, addresses should not be reused

Many email addresses are already public, or known by every site that you use. If you own a domain name, (at least one of) your email addresses is known by the registrar and (most likely) is viewable by the world via the whois database. Spam needs to be filtered on the recipient end, and today's spam filters do a reasonable job

Blockchain.info has acquired the Blockchain.com domain and will be moving their online wallet service there, so we may have to start saying Blockchain.com too.

What makes you think that this indicates a lack of understanding of money?

Yes, because Bitcoin is going to be increasingly important in the future. Not just the currency, but the technology and the network as well.


Yes, see:

This is the future of price tags. Except they'll use mBTC or mB, not BTC.

Thank you - my first tip :-)

These coins would be a way to equalize the currency holdings of the world's population. (Facebook is merely a proxy for identity verification, to prevent people from easily taking more than their fair share).
I'm surprised how much people hate the idea of making money. That wasn't my primary motivation, and I'm happy to reduce my "reserve" to 0%. I will make no money from this-- at least, no more than anyone else is able to.

I want a silent miner. Where can I get one?
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:19:37
We can make it 10%. The important thing is that it's transparent: there's no mystery about who gets the initial distribution of currency. Even bitcoin is actually very opaque in terms of who the holders of the currency are; they're more anonymous than me.
I'm not selling this to you; it's going to be completely free. You don't need to invest, either: it's definitely a risky investment, and I'll never suggest otherwise.
This is not the business plan - it's only an initial thought. It's going to take a long time for this to be developed and deployed.
Thanks for posting your concerns!

Buying bitcoins in 2009 was extremely risky. Those bitcoins could have ended up being worth nothing; even the core software has undergone major changes and updates since that time.
Also, the same thing will be said in 10 years from now. In 2024, people will be saying:
"Yeah, I can imagine the Bitcointopia, a dude that bought his bitcoins in 2014 owns half of Europe. It is so better than a fucked up world that you have to work to own something..."
We are still very, very early.

Very common in English. "Fill in the form" vs "Fill out the form", etc.

Great point. Facebook does delete these "spam" accounts on occasion, but no ID method is foolproof. We can institute other restrictions, e.g. require unique photo ID from countries/IP blocks that exhibit spammy-looking behavior.

There isn't a bitcoin hardfork using different PoW even though it's technically possible.

People will use them as money -
1) Medium of exchange: people will trade them for stuff.
2) Unit of account: people will measure the value of stuff with them.
3) Store of value: people will save them.
It is just like other forms of money except that the initial distribution is fair and equal. This distribution is the differentiator.
I will fund the necessary BTC (along with anyone else who may wish to invest), and I will receive some of the 20% reserve in exchange; that is my investment and it may or may not succeed.
Thanks for the questions!
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:23:51
Correct. The colored coins would use real Bitcoin - the protocol and network.

@_date: 2014-07-09 19:05:23
We already have federated addresses on the internet: they're called email addresses. Use email addresses as the identifier, and generate new bitcoin addresses each time using a mechanism like [Stealth Addresses](

You may be misunderstanding the context. This is a proposal for a new currency-- one with an equal initial distribution. One of the qualities of bitcoin (and I love bitcoin, by the way) is that early holders and miners have disproportionately large shares. One mining pool is gaining over 40% of the new bitcoins generated. This means newcomers don't get an equal stake. This is not a bad thing, but it is different.
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:24:34
None of the other alt coins use colored coins and are equally distributed across the entire population of the world (which is the goal; Facebook is only a proxy for global identification).
