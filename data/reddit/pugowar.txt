BOTH ARE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS
You shouldn't expect anything over a month in an investment. you shouldn't even look at it for a year.

the bitterness runs deep in this one.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:33:33
what difference does that make-are people hanging out in sega genesis forums? No they are talking about the Switch or PS4...do people talk about One Tree Hill? No they talk about stranger things...
who cares?

yes it will be a currency. It is volatile now because it is so new.
In a year it wont be as volatile.

The idea of a bubble is that it gets bigger and bigger until it bursts into nothing. People who argue bitcoin is a bubble are saying it hasn't burst yet. It is still a formed bubble. The question is whether it will burst or not- no one know and that is hwy investing is a risk. There is nothing that can grow forever...and it is arrogant to think that just because BTC is the strongest now it will be in five years unless people work to make it so.

Its FIFO
No- as long as you bought more bitcoin with it. If you withdrawl, you pay.
I am not a tax expert...this is what I have learned on the internet.

That because you haven't researched the technology behind the cryptocurrencies. You are not investing for the next few weeks - you are investing for the next few years and decades.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:56:45
yes. You have to pay all applicable state and federal taxes. Short term gains if you own it less then a year, long term if more then a year.

Hey I have some bitcoin in an electrum wallet. Can you please describe step by step what you did - or if you followed a resource online? Most of the resources I have found seem to skip steps. I would like to seperate my Bcash from my bitcoin as well.
Thank you.

go into a store and look at the videogame section, there are several different games that have difference prices and play differently. It is the same with cryptocurrencies- there are a bunch of different ones that are all different. Now look at the old games- some like Madden 2012 do not hold their value b/c there are newer games that are better. There are other games like Zelda that always stay full price. People are willing to pay for what they perceive as quality- and that is bitcoin right now. Will it be in 5 years? That is anyones guess. It definitely will NOT only be the  coin that is just the "cheapest"....
In my opinion, Bitcoin does not have value because it is a limited supply. If there were twice as many bitcoins, they would all just be worth half the amount. In the future, once all are mined maybe this will be an influence. Right now, bitcoin is worth as much as it is becasse people belive it will be worth that much or more in the future, and are excited about the technology and being part of the "future" or money.

Did the money leave your bank account? It could be that your bank flagged the purchase. If it hasn't left your bank account yet call your bank.I bought off of coinbase this AM and it went through immediately
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:34
its at 75% of the ATH? Where you concerned back in May?
It isn't that scary which is why no one is talking about it.

20 is a great start, keep putting more in if you want to. Just learn about blockchain, mining fees, etc and have fun learning. Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin core are 2 different cryptocurrencies just like how a granny smith and macintosh are two different apples. Make sure you research which "apple" is best for your recipe.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:20:17
See this isn't step by step enough for me...I have the private key, but what do you mean sweep? Is electron cash a bcash wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:00:21
hey thank you for this. Can you help a noob out- should I wait until the number of transactions decreases before I send my bitcoin (BTC) from one elysium wallet to another so that it can go faster? Is there a way to do this without fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:18:56
I think you should research and decide where to invest for yourself- which technology you believe in the most.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:01:11
You report what you paid for it and what you sold it for. You pay tax on the difference.

send a dm to   on twitter, they should be able to help you.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:44:12
Hodl the line! The technology is growing. Nothing has changed.

I think OP is trying to start up a cryptocurrency investment company. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:16:34
Do you know approximately when you bought, when you sold, and how much?
If do, find the lowest value for the cost around when you bought, and then highest cost around when you sold. Put that information on your tax return. If the IRS thinks you owe more - they will send you a letter. Pay what they tell you you owe. It will include interest. As long as you are not talking thousands of dollars, you are fine.

people should have the right to choose any crypto they want. There should be more choices, not less. If you believe BTC is the best- it will be the most valuable in the long run. Instead of focusing on trying to make an altcoin worse, focus your energy to make your choice better.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:26:54
You don't get to decide what the right direction is. Instead focus on making the coin you support the best it can be so it is obvious what the best coin is.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:14:44
you should look up the definition of pyramid scheme

where is the actual press release? There isn't a link in the 'article'
