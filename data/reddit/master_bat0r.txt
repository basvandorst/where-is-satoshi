An account within the EU (SEPA)would suffice. There are no fees to cash out on Bitcoin.de since you get the money directly to your account from the buyer like on localbitcoins. It's basically an escrow, not a "real" exchange.

You didn't read the leaks about infiltration of websites to discredit certain communities which are described as "hacktivists", did you? That shit is scary and it's not about any war at all, it's designed to fuck up people and communities that don't do anything illegal, so this is the most effective way to destroy them.
It's not a conspiracy theory, it's really happening but somehow people are always assuming that it's just the OTHER hacktivist communities that are infiltrated, not theirs.

There are many examples where a free market just leads to an advantage of big players or the suffering of the people. A free market does not work everywhere. Infrastructure, health care, water supply... All those things don't work with a "free" market because high profits for companies often mean the opposite of what is valuable to the people.

So you are saying that one of many altcoins which is based on a funny dog meme wants to be taken seriously? I think you don't get that dogecoin is so widely adopted be because it's funny. It's not serious and it's not supposed to be and that's why it's popular. There are a lot of coins and altcoins out there who do the serious part very well. Dogecoin is cool and it's a really funny idea, but it will hardly stick around longer than the usual meme. When people get sick of doge jokes as they got sick of fuuuuuu jokes, dogecoin will go too.

Cool, I'll check out that link later. A video where one of you uses the prototype for real with touch input and everything would also help to convince people to spend money.
Just a sidenote since I'm a plastics engineer: are you sure you can 3D print the casing? Most plastics that I know that are 3D printed are not very flexible/very brittle and wouldn't make a great flexible casing, but I'm not really up to date when it comes to 3D printing materials, so I'm not sure. When I think of flexible watch casings/wristbands I would recommend injection molded thermoplastic elastomer, although it's not very beautiful. Just some educated guesses, I don't really know what look or feel you are going for, just bear in mind that the material is not unimportant.

I am not too sure about that. People would not really want a coin controlled by Google because it would be worthless on its own, without the company. The main seller of crypto coins is that they are not controlled by anyone.
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:49:05
It does matter because it would be similar. Anyways, I'm just saying be careful when investing in dogecoin. It's funny and people like it and that's all cool, just don't throw any money in there you'll miss when it's gone. Same goes for Bitcoin, but the risk there is still a lot lower.

Mining is not really profitable anymore unless you do it on a very large scale like a whole business. The best way to take part in Bitcoin is to buy some. Mining is not for normal people anymore - unfortunately. You need very specialized hardware to do it.

I guess we will have to disagree on that one, a hello kitty coin wouldn't really catch on outside of a certain demographic too and people would loose interest after a while and I guess that will happen with dogecoin too.

Because more money? We still need a looooot more market cap than now to be stable and that would result in a higher price. Right now the market is too small to be stable. But it's getting better every day and the price will rise again.

@_date: 2014-02-26 12:27:54
What? Mining? No, what I mean is that right now a guy can dump a few thousand btc and the market goes crazy. With rising price and market cap usually comes a better distribution of coins over time and when one guy drops a million worth of btc people wouldn't care that much because it's only a tiny fraction of the market.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:04:09
I would be interested but I couldn't find any credentials on the website. If you want people to trust you and give you money, you will need to say who/what company you are.

I don't think so because to just shop online I already have PayPal or a credit card and stuff like that. What would a G coin bring to the table that is not already there?

You could have never known if Bitcoin is going to be around in 5 years, it has always been a game of faith.

You gotta look at it another way: the btc you spend are worth what you paid for them. So if you bought for 100$ and you spend 1 btc today, you don't spend the current 600$, you spend 100$. If you always look at your past buys with btc and say "oooh, now it's worth even more!" You are going to have a bad time and you didn't pay that much for the btc in the beginning anyway.

Nah man, it doesn't work like that. In a free market, the big guys fuck over the small ones. This is why a form of regulation is always needed. In a free market we wouldn't have net neutrality for example.

I would be careful with real investments in dogecoin because at one time people will feel that doge is stupid and not funny and that's the moment when dogecoin investors will have a problem. Remember the fuuuu comics? Remember how funny they were at the time? I laughed at a lot of them. And how do you feel about them now?

@_date: 2014-01-21 09:40:12
Hey, sorry for replying a day later, but I was very busy.
I would like to point out at the beginning that while I am generally for regulation and think that free markets are only good for the powerful, I don't believe that the current regulation is doing a good job. Regulation can really enable a system and make it fair for everyone, but it can also fuck it up and make it highly unfair so that only a few profit from it while everyone else suffers. Lobbyism is a root cause for such bad regulation that is only good for a certain group of people and bad for everyone else - such regulation is bad and is by no means what I want when I say that free markets don't work and we need a certain amount of regulation. 
I would say: "As much regulation as necessary and as much free market as possible" - If you know what I mean. It needs to be open but when it's totally free I can see many things go wrong.
You describe some bad regulations (like regulated monopolies etc), and those really need to change, but I would rally like to hear how you think a free market would solve the example problems I brought up in my comment above.
I mean the water supply and railroad example - I don't see how an unregulated market would solve these problems for the good of the citizen.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:24:58
More is not always better, do you know why they didn't accept your paperwork in the first place? Usually it's because it's too old or the wrong kind of document or the scanned quality is too low. I can totally see how sending it physically isn't gonna work though, that's just not how their process works.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:46:03

@_date: 2014-01-21 09:45:26
The problem with a system based on tort ist that you always fuck up first after it gets better - and "better" is basically a regulation after the trial so it doesn't happen again. Example: First you have to have a poisoned person (maybe killed) by bad water quality until you file a legal complaint against your water supplier. Then maybe that will stop, but you have a dead person. I could go on like this for every industry with every product - in the end you will have many people who died or suffered because there were no safety or health regulations and standards that companies had to adhere to and after the trial you have regulations again. 
If you regulate smart straight away when you see the problem coming (like certain standards for drinking water so it's no risk to you health when they drink it), the outcome is the same but people don't die.

Everybody can say that and people will compliment every idiot to be friendly. If your German is worth anything, translate that comment 1:1 and we'll see. If your German was good you could have answered in German right away so I guess it's pretty bad.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:39:17
Ah, okay, I didn't get it because even to assume that both outcomes are just as likely sounds crazy. But good advice nonetheless!

Guys, if you downvote a 16 year old kid for losing money you are assholes.

Finally some real information, thanks, this should be higher up.

Yupp, if steam accepted btc it would be a huge plus.

Is this an ironic thread that is supposed to show that bitcoiners are unfriendly towards noobs? Because we are not, you don't need a specific thread like this, you can just ask any question you want. We are a nice community.

If eBay implements some kind of escrow service like local Bitcoins, they could become one of the biggest exchanges over night.

Can we finally stop that stupid to the moon thing please? It's not funny anymore...

It's not good to have problems, but if they are fixable in a few weeks who cares? Bitcoin is still in beta if you will, better it comes out now than later.
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:18:08
Cool, thanks, I'm definitely gonna take a closer look!
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:13:02
Yes, but please just take the time to write 4 sentences as a reply if it's not a hard question. It's always nicer to just get the answer instead of a link to a wiki, no matter how often the question has been answered.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:38:03
Basically the Bitcoin  protocol spits out 25 btc every ten minutes to one of the miners. The more computing power you have, the more likely it is that you get these 25btc. At the beginning only very few people were mining and they used normal CPUs like the one in your PC and all you needed was a small mining client program. Today much more people are mining and they use extremely overpowered special hardware to have a chance at the 25btc (called asics). If you don't have one of those you don't stand a chance. Also back in the day it was 50btc every ten minutes. In a few years it will be 12.5btc. So mining got very hard and is going to get harder, I recommend to just buy some Bitcoins instead of getting into mining, it's a lot less risky because you don't have to buy expensive specialized hardware.

I cannot comprehend why they still wouldn't give out any information about what's happening. They are basically SCREAMING for rumors and mockery.

Thanks to Bitcoin, not your political agenda, that's a difference.

I'm with you there, those things suck and they need to change. But I don't think we would be better off without any regulation at all because that would give the big players more ways to fuck over the small ones, just because they have the power to do so. 
This is especially true for infrastructure like water, electricity etc. Privatization and deregulation of these things in most cases leads to poor quality, very little investment in the future and higher prices for the end consumer because there is no real competition (and there can't be, because you can't build two water supplies to every house). There are cruel examples in Africa where the privatized water supply is SO bad that it's undrinkable so everyone buys expensive bottled water for drinking.... and both businesses are owned by the same people. They don't want to deliver good drinking water to the houses because they would have to invest into the infrastructure and make less money with bottled water. The consumers there have no "choice" or anything, all they can do ist get robbed by the expensive bottled water supplier and there is no competitor for water supply in sight. It's just corporate power bleeding out the poor guys - a bad example of a free, unregulated market.
[Here is a gold awarded post from a few months ago]( describing how the railroad had to be regulated for the steel mills to have a fair competition so the end consumer doesn't get fucked by high prices.

Please provide a link from a credible source that says the banks took all savings from Greek citizens. Because that never happened.
@_date: 2015-10-30 12:00:38
That's a silly question... Imagine what would happen if I invested all of our savings into Bitcoin and tomorrow Bitcoin goes to zero for whatever reason. That's quite the relationship booster, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2015-10-30 10:27:10
Probably because I like my apartment and my car and my girlfriend... But that's just silly old me.

If you connect from a US IP you can already pay with Bitcoin. I have bought games with btc there for a year I think.
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:56:49
Sure, but some websites restrict paying with Bitcoin due to tax or legal reasons.
@_date: 2015-02-21 13:48:28
Hoffentlich :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:45:37
Really good  tutorial, thanks for your post. I will spend some of my Saturday preparing this :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:00:15
I am saying that OP's claims are nothing but wild speculation while he is calling it "simple math", do you want to dispute that?
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:33:54
No we don't. We only know some of them. It's not possible to make precise predictions of the future with this limited knowledge. You may prove me wrong by predicting the Bitcoin price on February 22nd.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:13:45
Already ordered something 2 weeks ago and I enjoyed my BTC paid meal a lot :)

Funny thing is that he is probably still out there and watching us enjoy his creation. Does that sound too religious?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:08:33
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:58:48
No. You can not extrapolate future happenings from old data if you don't know the laws that are at work (which nobody can in this case) - especially if you look at something for the first time. It's just speculation. 
Now if you would observe the adoption of Bitcoin in different universes many many times you might be able to tell what happens next in our universe... But until then it's not more than a good looking guess.
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:19:22
Very nice camp, I also love that you are only hosting 10 people per week, that keeps it personal. Keep up the good work!

I would definitely like to use it to pay online, but it should be usable in Germany (amazon.de) too.

Dude, you are genius. I love it. I was always a supporter of the smaller units but bits are just genius.

Germany here, made several SEPA withdrawals of 1000€ over the last few months, all took around 3 weeks. It's slow but it works.

If I say Bitcoin will be worthless tomorrow at 3pm, would you like to have a discussion about that? No, you want to see the facts. Just like I am asking for facts that could back up his wild speculations. 
If you make general predictions like you think the price is gonna rise or fall because of this and that that's cool and we can have a discussion about it. If you make precise predictions about market prices expect to be called out for facts, otherwise it's just a funny guess and thereby useless.
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:38:02
I would give them the advice that BTC is just amazing for buying stuff online with low fees. Its basically PayPal with less fees and that is really the core competence of the BTC and that is where it's best at. For a real retail store it might be too early for mass adoption. Just me being a realist.

Funny, that's exactly what a scammer would say. You are suffering from this? Good. If you had been hacked you could have contacted localbitcoins immediately and everything would have stopped then - but his shit went on for five (edit: three) days, so I say you are lying.
Edit: Also: you say you have proof that it wasn't you. Please provide it if you are serious.

Is this a US only thing? Because shipping to other parts of the world is usually too expensive, so you might want to clarify on that one. I would love to see some EU deals!
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:33:10
Simple math? Simple math doesn't cut it in this case. I'd like to see the research where you predict when the money is gonna come and how much of it, with statistical probability analysis etc

It's not about Bitcoin, if you sell your HDD and know how easy it is to read it even if it has been deleted, you make sure that no one can read your personal data. Deleting the Bitcoin wallet in that process is just a side effect.
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:13:14
Since you did not read the parent comment: people who are tech savvy enough to mine Bitcoins in 2009 probably do delete their data before selling it.
@_date: 2013-12-13 11:39:10
The news are also speculation. It's all speculation, nobody knows if or when wall street is investing big loads of money. I'm not saying it's not gonna happen, I'm just saying you can not know for sure and predict the exact timing.
