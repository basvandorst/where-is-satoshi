All these csgo people, i am glad i sticked to bitstamp, are they paying out usd balances fully, or are they splitting the losses?
@_date: 2018-09-25 10:07:33
the common man thats stupid enough to think its a scam will be stupid enough to not notice the 8.75% difference between the atm and the exchange prices, or will think that it normal because its volatile, or wont even want to purchase btc from an atm anyways so your argument is invalid
@_date: 2018-09-15 12:28:52
nice chbs shill whatever that is
@_date: 2018-09-25 06:01:30
no one buys 50000 usd worth of btc from an atm, they buy 10-20 to see how it works etc, so they will get 1-2 dollars of fees, see how awesome blockchain technology is, do research, then they will buy from exchanges, awesome for adoption, you tit.
@_date: 2018-09-15 15:46:23
i dont want to get scammed by buying CHBS ty
@_date: 2018-09-15 15:56:24
xd 
all of the other coins are well known coins and then you put in a shitcoin for BOTH btc and eth pair so people will notice it

if they are educated, spend the next 3 days gathering information about it, like make a presentation, they will see the passion in you, and the potential of the "project"
even if they think that its a scam they should let you buy it because it would be a great learning experience and they will reward you for a hard work you done
if they watch it, there are 3 options:
1: they let you buy because they think its good
2: they let you buy because they think its bad but you learn from your mistakes
3: they are stupid and they won't let you (this is bad parenting)
if its option 3 buy it yourself on localbitcoins, but give your parents one more chance

oh dont worry i got the words written down, bitch.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:04:22
its bitcoin cash BCC
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:08:28
its not, but i am a long time seller on there, made a few thousand dollar profit using the website, and i just simply dont see them worth investing 140 bitcoin again to keep it running. (60 bitcoin was the sites owner, 40 was the users, so he has to repay 40 bitcoin to the users from his own pocket)
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:01:50
Lets hope that the owner wont run with the steam gifts/csgo keys/tf2 keys that we have on his bots because he might aswell take what he can with the sinking ship.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:11:30
I am actually stupid with the 140 btc one, idk why i was thinkin that.
Yes i hope the later one too!
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:09:51
before june the site was VIP based where u had to pay 50 USD as a one time payment, so he dont even get monthly money, other then the fees which is not that much considering there is only a few popular game there which doesnt sell more than max 100 a day
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:21:28
how do you pay with your phone using btc for bread and milk?
not every place has a bitcoin atm 10 meters away, but you can withdraw money from every atm with a xapo credit card, they also said that they will support the stronger chain, which is obvious, why would they try to force a chain when people are more interested in the other one?
is this sub really this fucking autistic?
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:34:06
Thanks a lot for your help!:)
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:47:49
Thank you:) I have started on dispenser.tf too, then i saw that their only competition is opskins, where the cheapest key is over 2 dollars, because the seller has to pay 5/10% fee, so i have decided to start something since there is a huge opportunity for cheaper keys with less profit but higher volume.
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:21:33
If its about ordering keys, then you don't have to contact me, just type the amount and your trade URL, and i will see it in the admin panel, and after the money is sent to me you will get your keys, if its a problem with the site/other things, then please pm me on reddit, or add my storage account, and we can talk there.

this fucking retarded pizza meme again, it doesnt matter what its worth now, if he didnt buy that pizza maybe no one would have looked at the value side of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:09:39
Can you tell me if your money gets converted at the rate they show it on the website? Like are they really converting it at btc-e rates and such? it seems too good to be true, i was thinkin about spectrocoin but they convert at 430 USD right now, while btc-e is 442
