The dealers already take a massive 20-30% hit from cashing out and laundering their illegal money. A single one of their bitcoin transactions is worth thousands, even a $5 transaction fee won't matter one bit.
Customers already wait days or weeks for their product to arrive, waiting a couple of hours for bitcoin confirmation doesn't make much difference. Especially now that Alphabay has the Queue option where you can click the order button straight away, and the vendor will only ship once the bitcoins confirm.
As an occasional user of DNMs I say keep the 1mb limit, the main reason we use bitcoin instead of Liberty Reserve is because LE can't shut it down. Reject the BU bullshit.

Lol you have no idea what you're talking about.
Vendors already take a 10-30% hit from laundering their bitcoins into cash. Customers already pay 10% markup to get anonymous bitcoins. A few cents fees are nothing.
For drug use cases, we can send with a cheaper transaction fee and wait overnight for a confirmation (we already wait days or weeks for the product to be delivered, 12-24 hours for a confirmation is okay)
The main reason drug users use bitcoin instead of Liberty Reserve is because LE can't shut bitcoin down. Forget trying to lower fees, keeping bitcoin decentralized is more important.

It must be really weird to have random internet nicknames talk about you all like this, but when we see how bitcoin's enemies lie about your work and attack you for their own political ends, we feel the need to defend you. And I know you're human too, it must suck to working as volunteers on this project for years only to have some people lie about your work and attack you personally.
You're more than just developers now, but heroes and champions in our little community. :)
We're going to be okay. Educate as many people as we can and purge the masterminds behind it all.
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:52:57
Well maybe localbitcoins should also contribute to core development?
I remember in 2013-14 there were concerns about how these important developers work for free, yet it seemed very few bitcoin companies that depended on their work wanted to contribute. Now that they banded together to get VC funding, those same companies are complaining?

What do you say to the argument that bitcoin mining relies on the centralized FIBRE network, which is only necessary because of large block sizes, and therefore bitcoin's decentralization is *already* damaged by large block sizes.

Everyone over at r/darknetmarkets for a start. Go to any party in the western world where drugs are used and people will know about buying drugs from the internet. Bitcoin, Tor and PGP have created a new golden age just like the 60s. The long-term decline in LSD use was reversed in 2011 when the first dark net market was created.
Then you've got all the poker players, online gamblers, gamers and money transferers who use bitcoin today.
Plus you have to realize how few bitcoins there actually are, and how many were lost in some forgotten password or throw-away hard drive.

Imagine if you wrote a book all about Islamic terrorist attacks. You'd say "look at these evil muslims constantly doing terrorist attacks, every muslim is like that". There wouldn't be any "lies" in that book (every terrorist attack did indeed happen), but the constant emphasis on the very worst extremists would still make it a very misleading and hateful book.
Plus I did see a couple of technical mistakes in the free section on Amazon (I won't tell you what they are because I don't want to help you) but it's clear nobody familiar with bitcoin proof-read it.

Debt collectors and bailiffs cant take your money or steal your wages. It's like cash but for the internet. You can live off-the-grid with it. The UK is a great places for this since there's no ID cards.
Also you can buy weed with it.
Plus you can store it on your encrypted hard drive or written down on a single sheet of paper or even memorized in your brain. It's far easier to keep secure than physical cash.
edit: forgot to mention that with  and  and some others it's pretty easy to buy most everyday things with bitcoin.

Such FUD.
DNMs don't work this way. Your transaction has to have 3 confirmations before the marketplace lets you click 'Buy'.

You cant buy or sell any of those altcoins without going through bitcoin first. It's not too hard to make bitcoin's anonymous anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:18:53


Oh thats BS. We have no idea what holders of bitcoin will do. Some of these 8 "major" players are not as major or important as you think.
Blockchain.info : Really? How much more incompetent coding and lost coins do they have to screw up before we finally ignore them?
bitgo.com, xapo.com : Both online wallets. From what I can tell most people use Electrum or Multibit anyway. Or transfer straight from an exchange to their marketplace. Also wasn't bitgo.com responsible for losing 80btc belonging to one of their customers?
Bitpay.com : Didn't they release figures a few months ago showing merchants steadily leaving and volume going down?
kncminer.com : Miners don't decide whether a hardfork succeeds. They follow the economy otherwise they'll be mining fool's gold.
itbit.com : An exchange is good but call me when **localbitcoins.com**, okcoin, bitfinex, bitstamp, etc make a statement.
circle.com : As above
bitnet.io : what is this? Hardly a "major" player.
A huge *huge* **huge** part of the economy that everyone seems to be missing is the **dark net markets**. Throughout the past 18 month bear market this the only sector that's shown any real growth. Come over to or any of the onion forums to see.
Quite frankly bitcoin is not that great for paying for ordinary stuff in most situations, which is why bitpay's business is going down. All the exchanges which require AML/KYC get left behind in favor of more p2p solutions. Why? Because people want to get high.
Dark net markets will be the decider because the majority of commerce goes through them. Their business relies on bitcoin being decentralized and anonymous. Their business works just fine if transaction fees go up a bit, but not if miners only mine your transaction if you send them your ID. Smaller blocks are king for them, there is absolutely no way they'll switch to BitcoinXT **8GB** blocks.
Peace out guys, I'm off to smoke a bowl.
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:21:52
Yes that's sufficient proof.
Your bitcoins got swept into what is probably their wallet, and they try blowing you off? Sounds like they're trying to scam you.

Could you use BTC to buy things you need from stores? It might be slightly more convenient than converting them to dollars.

Have fun being spied on.
Everyone is up in arms about facebook spying on people. Now imagine there's no cash and your bank can see every purchase you ever make.
And before you say "ackchyually bitcoin is not very private", we're talking about lightning which is much more private than the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:31:51


Interesting. But if you lost your private keys you might not even know which addresses were yours. Also couldn't you just point to any address? I could say Satoshi's addresses are mine and they'll probably never move.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:00:31
I see I've hit a nerve.
The runup is because of this: 
In 2011 when Silk Road was created, each bitcoin block added 50btc to the new supply while today each block adds only 12.5btc. Reduced inflation means prices goes up. Not to mention that bitcoin has gotten more widely known and more people have heard of it so demand is much higher too.
Too bad you didn't hodl any of those old bitcoins, they'd make you way less salty now that the price is mooning.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:10:17
Assuming you're cool enough to go to student parties, go to the corner where people are smoking weed and ask them about bitcoin and the dark net markets. All of them will have heard of it and a surprising number will have used it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:18:02
I've gotten plenty of use from bitcoin, and so have countless others.
With bitcoin you can buy mind-altering substances online and have them sent to your front door, just like Amazon. Not to mention you've got the online casinos, international payments, permissionless donations, anonymous payments, etc, etc.
Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world via the internet anonymously without being seized, censored or frozen by anyone. That is valuable. Maybe it's worth $5000 per coin or $500 or $50000 per coin, I don't know exactly but it has a value for sure.

iirc Evolution market had one-time use addresses which improved privacy but burned a lot of people who sent coins there many times.
An even better improvement would be for the Deposit page to have not one but several bitcoin addresses you can deposit into. Meaning you can split up your deposits and the total size won't be able to be tracked.

It's sounding like you're saying these things are okay because a state did them.
What about the Islamic *State* of Iraq and the Levant? You might say that's not a real state because other states don't say it's real (which is circular reasoning but there you go). Then we've got the Sri Lankan state's terrorism against the Tamil minority, and plenty of other examples of terrorist activity by states.

It is permitted and always has been. *Promoting* hard fork clients was banned.
Same way how on drug subreddits its okay to talk about drugs but not okay to sell them.

The only reason you use bitcoin instead of paypal for drugs is because it's decentralized.
Fricking hell, you of all people should get why decentralization is important.
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:54:53




I'm not disagreeing but some people do use it as a currency today.
In fact there's a huge community of bitcoin users who do nothing more than buy it, use it to buy stuff on the darknet. Or they sell stuff on darknet and receive bitcoins. Just like how many people in the world buy dollars and use them to buy oil.
Bitcoins are king over there, nobody wants shitty ethereum or some other scamcoin that you cant sell or buy without going through bitcoin first or without going through some KYC/AML exchange, and that doesn't have any other advantages over using bitcoin itself.

Say that you were trading with someone on the forums, you gave them your coinbase address for them to pay you. They used their gambling account to withdraw straight to your address. That's why it looks like you were withdrawing from a gambling site to coinbase.

DNM user here.
From what I see, a huge amount of the volume on darknet marketplaces comes from people moving massive bulk. These people use the markets as a wholesale supplier, they buy multiple kilos, not grams, to resell in real life. They make up the majority of cash flow over there, way more than small time personal users like me.
These dealers already take a massive 20-30% hit from cashing out and laundering their illegal money. A single one of their bitcoin transactions is worth thousands, a $5 transaction fee won't matter one bit.
Keep the 1mb limit I say, the main reason we use bitcoin instead of Liberty Reserve is because LE can't shut it down.
If it really does get to something as high as $5, we can send with a smaller transaction fee and wait overnight for a confirmation (we already wait days or weeks for the product to be delivered, 12-24 hours for a confirmation isn't much).
