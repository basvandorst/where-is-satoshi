FUN FACT : Cacao beans were actually used for "micro-transactions" in the aztec economy :  ["Small purchases were made with cacao beans, which had to be imported from lowland areas. In Aztec marketplaces, a small rabbit was worth 30 beans, a turkey egg cost 3 beans, and a tamal cost a single bean."](

The stuff in hershey bars is mostly sugar. But yeah, it has some of it in there. Mostly from Africa, and some of it picked up and processed by under age labor.

And our first pledge from a bitcoin source!

A tremendous leap over the initial preview they released last year. 
Our testnet store :

FYI , there's a puertorrican political prisoner in the US of A, **for almost four (4) decades**, also FBI have assassinated (left to bleed to death) an old man pro-independence leader in his home in Puerto Rico. Not mentioning the hundred year old repression to the independence movement.So you should also research YOUR country first, before bashing others.

Partially the reason to shutdown our OB store. Also Washington Sanchez is a BU supporter. The integration of Shapeshift the nail.

4 days now, credit not applied and no refund issued. I fear these guys are insolvent and not able to refund $40.

Agreed. They were amazing until this transaction. People found Mt. Gox amazing at some point in time.

They refunded BTC after 4 days. Not sure if I will use them again after displaying terrible customer service. Had to go to a gas station to activate phone the old fashion way.

No, I sent him some suggestions on wallet software and processors so he could decide. At some point he installed some wallet, sent me an address, I sent some bits to test, and then re-used address for final order. Definitely, it will be great if he adds bitcoin as an additional payment method.

Currently I do not make chocolate at his level. I have a farm where I have some Theobroma cacao L. trees, but I'm propagating and planting lots more. I've made some rustic chocolate for internal consumption. Maybe in the future we can sell him our beans (cacao seeds) and he can make a new origin bar. But craft chocolate is a very diverse universe were you can find lots of differentiation from cacao origins and from chocolate makers. It's a lot like the wine industry. Why I pay? To taste the best chocolate out there and learn.

The website, is not updated, I think. I had to write an email to them to check availability. He was finishing a last batch of Jamaica this week, and still had some Sambirano bars.

Didn't want to overwhelm him with technical stuff. Just letting things evolve organically.

Got it!

Yes, we also do it in person at the Old San Juan farmers market :

Sorry for the late reply. (Working at a friend's farm) Thanks! You got it! :) (if you don't mind sending a shipping address to info[at]cacao.farm, as soon as we have a bar ready, we'll send you one free of charge.) In regards of the price per bar, yes, it may seem a bit high. This is one is kind of a "fund raiser" bar, but we are aiming at the average pricing of most bean to bar craft chocolate. Definitely not  ($270 bar) but around guys like  (~$9-11)  Thanks again!
