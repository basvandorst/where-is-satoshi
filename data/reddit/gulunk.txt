That's fluctuation of his portfolio, not his liquid assets. He would definitely notice 2.8 mil in liquid assets disappearing.

I'd beg to differ, Bill Gates would definitely bat an eye at any major loss, even if it was only 10k. Granted a single time 2.8 mil loss wouldn't devastate him financially but to say he wouldn't notice nor care about it is very unlikely. Wealthy people who don't bat their eyes at losses typically don't stay wealthy for long, look at a lot of former NFL players as well as lotto winners who didn't bat their eyes at losses initially.

Well let me know if you win the lotto. I'll gladly be your accountant if you're not gonna notice nor keep track of your money.

How are you getting these averages? If you are doing it solely from adding the starting &amp; ending price of each year then dividing by 2, that's not a very effective way to determine the yearly averages. There's enough information out there to take it's value quarterly, even monthly to give a better indication of the yearly average rate. Also if my assumption on how you calculated each yearly average is correct, it appears you forgot to divide on the averages calculated for 2012 &amp; 2014; then made up an average number for 2013.....You might want to double check your numbers again.
