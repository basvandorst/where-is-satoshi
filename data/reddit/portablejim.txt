Hello. This is my first post on I have been interested in bitcoin, seeing how deep the rabbit hole goes (developer guide)

How does the multi-signature stuff actually get used? With single-signature wallets, the recipient has the key to use the balance (producing the signature, etc) and can just put the transaction on the blockchain, but how does that work when multiple signatures are at play?
How are bits frozen into sidechains?
What is the most effective way to learn more (e.g. read BIP 1 to whatever the latest BIP is)?

So the parties need to communicate the information between each other before one party submits the final transaction to the blockchain?
Or is there some way for the script to extend the script and add their signatures by publishing a new transaction?

Just wanted to chime in to say I am running a node as well. Decided my VPS can do something useful in it's spare time.

One use i see for cash is being able to pay friends, or other individuals (eg. garage sale, buskers, when a frend says "can I borrow $20"). 
What is your suggested way to make those payments? I am starting to think the fastest, cheapest and easiest way would be to get to an ATM, withdraw cash, and give the cash to the person.
... Well, writing this I'm starting to think "What do my friends need bitcoin for?", even "What do I need bitcoin for?"
If it is supposed to be digital cash, then shouldn't it be useful for the cases where I actually use fiat cash?
