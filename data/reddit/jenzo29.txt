There has been a influx in Dogecoin posts, and i agree that some do run off topic and derail and annoy bitcoin community. However i feel that there is a general hatred toward the "Joke" currency and that it shouldn't be regarded seriously, when it has 3/4th largest cap of the mineable coins and should be taken more seriously. 
I agreed with your points, but there was no need to show a graph of it readjusting after the halving, and any bitcoiners or currency holders should know that there are large fluctuation in the price.  
To address the edit, you brought up a graph and stated that dogecoin isn't doing so well in the last few days, and i responded to show you that all of our currencies can be shown to look bad if you manipulate the timescale.

This is why i feel that doge is useful to bitcoin, i would never have started in cryptos without doge, but now i understand much better i can transition into currencies such as Bitcoin. 
The way i would put it is that Bitcoin is this large Labrador that looks powerful and mean if you dont understand dogs, whereas Dogecoin is the little puppy that you can pet and understand before being brave enough to go see the larger one.

Its the nature of his job, to be in control of the interview.

Yes but 5 billion a year vs the 100 or so billion mined by the time this is released.

As you can see you could do both tips and add revenue. Add rev to google and donations to the content provider.  I would happily give 10$ worth to my favorite content providers, and if Google made it easier i would.

How where is the proof? And why does this matter, he lost a lot of money, yes it may be insignificant now to him but you can still be upset as a millionaire when you loose money.

Doesn't work on desktop either. We may have killed it.

By the time these are out most of dogecoins will be mined.

I believe you have the wrong scale, anyone can make something look like it is failing by using a 3 day time scale, look at the 7 day one: 
I agree the top comment has no relevance to the discusion, but you also are trying to put other currencies down (i.e graph) and that anyone could do the same for you, here was your graph a week ago for BTC:
Looks remarkably familiar doesn't it?

There was a case in the USA where the judge sent a guy to prison as s/he felt he didnt disclose all his funds IIRC for a divorce. I think he spend 10-20 years inside and was eventually released after this time without releasing the funds if he ever had any.

Correct no block limit, but 5 billion a year vs the 100 or so billion mined by the time this is released.

If you are so certain it will go above 1K again whats stopping everyone from buying more? The answer is that its just speculation, if you cant afford to loose more cut your losses now, if you are willing to let it ride go ahead. There is no guarantee it will go back up, ever.
