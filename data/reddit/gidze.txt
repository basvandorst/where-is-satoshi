We have been using ShapeShift over a year in Coinomi wallet. One of the best services in the crypto land and our users love it. Wish luck to the team.

They control mining pools, not hashing power. When mining becomes completely decentralized they would not matter.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:20:34
I agree about the BIP109 name usage, it was prematurely publicly published.
@_date: 2015-12-08 08:46:27
There is no evidence to support this claim. In that case we should wait and see if the big pools become smaller once we have advanced techniques that minimize block propagation latency (less incentive to mine on the biggest pool).
@_date: 2015-12-08 01:02:03
It's cheaper to aggregate hashing power than acquiring it. By observing how the big pools change in size over time we can deduce that most of the hashing power does not belong to the pools themselves.
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:49:33
Good feedback. Regarding IBLTs there is no mention because they aren't used in the current design. However I think we could use them to reconstruct huge coinbases (that usually P2Pool creates) from previous soft blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:08:35
Remember that a soft block is only relayed when a node has all the transactions in the mempool and can always request missing TXs from the originator node.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:27:24
With the soft block mechanism the miners preannounce transactions that they work on so the network can pull and rebroadcast any transaction that wasn't known. In the best case, about 350 bytes must be relayed when a block is found.
@_date: 2015-12-18 10:00:07
Try to enable the BIP39 passphrase option when restoring.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:18:34
I requested the number from Gregory and he "soft" reserved it. It wasn't meant to be released publicly before we had an implementation and metrics that this concept works. BTW I sent you a message in IRC to review it but never got a reply.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:40:52
I independently invented the soft block concept and used other ideas to improve it, check the acknowledgements section. I was pointed to previous discussions when asked for peer reviews.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:43:35
Thanks. It seems IRC is a lossy communication medium.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:33:02
It is a soft block DAG not a chain. Miners learn and announce the transactions they work on to other miners. The whole p2p network is acting as a giant Bitcoin Relay Network.
@_date: 2015-12-20 11:45:48
Correct. If we had 30mb blocks, that would mean 30mb of transaction data over 10 minute period plus a 30mb block when it's found, totally 60mb. With soft blocks we spread 31.5mb over the 10 minute period and don't have to relay 30mb blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-03 06:43:10
Very useful tutorial, thanks for your effort.
How easy is to run Bitcoinj on iOS devices? Maybe using j2objc and replacing spongy castle with libsecp256k1?

Also you can restore the seed on Coinomi wallet that is BIP44 compatible.
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:17:56
The standard you are looking for is the [BIP39]( (the BIP44 is a specific BIP32-like key hierarchy structure) and the list can be found [here](

Cool, thanks Mike!

Why do you think BitRated was not used? Hassle to setup maybe?
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:01:43
You could be near a hydroelectric or Nuclear plant in the US but mine with stratum on a Chinese pool. Due to the natural selfish mining that is happening in China it is expected that everybody mines with them. All this is caused by the consensus lag due to the Great Firewall and the 1mb blocks (bigger blocks will make things worse).
One solution to this is to optimize the Bitcoin p2p block relay i.e. use soft/weak blocks, IBLTs etc
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:24:35
We also run it at Coinomi.
Is the patch the one from [Gavin]( I guess it's something else, would like to take a look.

These days I am in Athens and people are very afraid about their bank savings. An overwhelming majority has no idea about Bitcoin but they are very curious when I casually mention it in conversations.
Cash is king here but a lot of people get their salaries via a bank account. With the capital controls in effect from last Friday the retail activity dropped dramatically. You can only withdraw 60euros per day.
Personally I try to spread the knowledge but it seems that it will take time for people to realize what a trustless decentralized ledger is capable of.
@_date: 2015-12-06 12:15:33
If you were following the arguments, even 1mb block is too big for proper decentralization and security. What we need is a new block relay technique that could handle &gt;1mb blocks. Just increasing the block size does not scale Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:04:26
I am the author of this document. It wasn't meant to be released publicly before we had an implementation and some solid metrics.
@_date: 2015-12-20 11:53:55
If you read it carefully, you will notice that it works like the Bitcoin Relay Network that stream block data without broadcasting 1mb blocks. With 4mb segregated witness blocks it will become more urgent to update our block relay infrastructure.

But I am optimistic, they are homo sapience just like you and me and they can improve a lot their condition with access to the Internet (education) and Cryptos (global economy)

The biggest side effect is the increased consensus latency with big blocks. This means more orphaned blocks, more hash power wasted.
We could easily handle 50 transactions per second today if the blocks were announced efficiently.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:53:09
No I am a developer and I see it from a technical point of view (disclosure I own a bit of crypto).
I am referring to the "bugs" that cryptos still have but it is innevitable as all new technologies have issues before they go mainstream (or when the cryptos will have trillions of volume)
@_date: 2014-05-21 03:01:27
We need cryptographic-based voting system that provides secret vote and funds management.
We don't need to re-invent our established communication tools.
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:10:13
Are you sure? I haven't checked how the protocol handles this but from what I asked the miners include the transaction that came first and has a fee. If a miner does otherwise it's a deviation from the protocol.
In any case it is interesting to make some experiments.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:03:30
True, but what about the third world? We still need to protect consumers (and merchants) there, even if there is no regulation.
@_date: 2014-05-21 02:40:56
1) we don't need to reinvent communication tools that we have already: forums, IRC, Reddit, YouTube, etc
2) Yes, if we focus on the real objectives: anonymous voting via the blockchain, community migration from the centralized Bitcoin Foundation to the distributed Bitcoin Foundation and BTC deposits control from the board members (to hire devs, media, etc)
3) The 200 BTC can be escrowed with a respected community member. I propose Giannis
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:47:29
I hope this doesn't happen as in will hinder retail bitcoin adoption (who will wait 10 minutes in a supermarket). Also it *is* deviation from the protocol if it does something different than Bitcoin Core that is the reference implementation.
There is one pool that does exactly this but the general feeling is negative: 
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:26:43
It does: "Bitcoin is not a deliberate Ponzi"
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:31:15
Just include a normal fee. With Bitcoin you pay less for a transaction than with Visa or PayPal, so always include a fee.
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:10:04
Wish you the best luck, dudes!

Check out [Coinomi]( it is an Android wallet that stores coins using a deterministic keychain (BIP44). It also supports other coins beyond Bitcoin.

Did you got verified? They can freeze your account if you deposit too much fiat/crypto.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:31:54
This is being solved with M-of-N Standard Transactions. What this means is that you can involve 3 parties with only 2 of their private keys are required to make the transaction complete.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:11:15
Nice reminder about the dangers of the cloud.
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:15:38
True. You make a good point in that the merchant wallet should warn them that the client didn't include the transaction fee and the associated risks with accepting that transaction.

@_date: 2014-03-06 10:14:25
Very good example for Amazon and Overstock. I think a lot of people would distrust sending directly cryptos to merchants if there is no protection of a trusted third party. This is like paying with PayPal vs giving out your credit card info.
So what is the solution? I think in the global market we need a more voluntary arbitration/escrow because it is more effective on a technical level.
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:29:25
Because Bitcoin is a consensus network and giving one group more power over another group disrupts the balance. So the recent decrease in fees was initiated by the core devs but it cannot be forced upon the miners. Some miners accept it, some don't.
In general this is more a UI/communication issue than a protocol problem.
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:13:03
I agree with you, but the option should be there in the advanced settings and should not be the default one.
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:31:28
They have $25mil of investments, so what to do than to acquire aggressively new customers?

Hi Gavin, thanks for what you did for Bitcoin!
I am developing a multi-coin wallet that let users control their funds with BIP44.

Here you go mr President

@_date: 2014-05-10 10:49:26
It is still possible to send transactions without a fee. For example from sufficiently old transactions, higher total value and small transaction size.
Check here for some details: 
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:17:26
Hi, if you have Android phone, try the Coinomi multi-coin wallet where *you* control your keys.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:50:40
not true at all.
Because everything is decentralized and to a huge extent automatized it is possible to get a self-sustainable business and yet charging in the range of .5%-1% of the transaction that is much lower than VISA. As a bonus the minimal amount for the transaction will be fractions of a cent so micro transactions are possible vs minimum $0.10 that VISA charge. And off course you get all the benefits  that VISA provides.
Shameless plug: I am a developer and starting a startup that will deal with consumer/merchant protection, a payment processing, etc All based on blockchain and p2p technologies. I am accepting investments in any coin. PM me if you are interested.
@_date: 2014-05-21 02:09:58
Well let's hope that the 51 % are honest node... eeee sorry I meant people.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:48:22
Yes! In a sense even now if somebody enters bitcoin they are an early adopter.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:02:18
Extra fees. Let's say that the transaction cost for VISA is 2% (just made that up) for BTC this could be something like .5%-1%. These are enough funds to pay people to resolve disputes (also keep in mind that a small percent of the total transactions will be disputed). In all cases the consumer and merchant can resolve the dispute themselves, on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:09:04
I was aware that the baseband software was proprietary and had bugs but I never imagined that it has such impact on the main OS.
Thanks for opening my eyes.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:05:34
Totally, because we are talking about decentralized trust here.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:08:09
I spent a lot of time debugging transaction signing on various alt-coins and this is not always the case.
For example Peercoin has a uint32 field after the transaction version field that encodes the creation time of that transaction.
The good news is that most of the cases the firmware changes would be trivial.
I would love to integrate Trezor with Coinomi :)
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:23:11
Do you know how much potential access to the rest of the system a baseband can have? Root access?
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:22:46
I haven't used breadwallet, but if it uses Hierarchical Deterministic keys then yes, you will get all your BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:24:59
So true. The price is a secondary effect.

@_date: 2014-07-17 21:32:18
Nice one. A decentralized ponzi.
In the end it doesn't mater what they say, the blockchain technology will prevail.
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:50:49
It would be nice to create a new BIP70 style specification to allow the metered channel creation inside any compatible wallet.
I was thinking about this kind of functionality for a long time: basically you scan a qr-code and your wallet displays a start, stop buttons along with a timer and the cost. In case of an incompatible wallet it gracefully degrades to the current functionality.
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:36:23
This could be implemented on Counterparty, Dogeparty, NTX, Collored Coins, Ethereum, etc.
The tokens will be created and then crowd-sold. The same crypto-tokens could be used to receive future dividends. They could be sold on the free market and this leads to some complications.
The biggest problem is the legal framework that is still catching up but overall there is a positive curiosity about the underlying technology that is the blockchain.
Very excited overall also for my crypto-based startup!
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:23:45
It says "Bitcoin is not a deliberate Ponzi" and the paper is about Ponzi schemes.
It is subtle but the message is there, sorry.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:00:16
Yes, but Bitcoin and it's descendants are gaining momentum.
Think in perspective that the modern western financial institutions have roots that date hundreds of years. They got a lot of power the last century so in order to replace (in reality evolve) this system you need many years. Dare I say 25 years from now? Who knows? Such mystery.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:11:46
Good analogy. But I am not after VISA and the Banking system, I am after the BILLIONS that don't have access to the banking system. It may sound impressive but there are many competitors with a head-start, but in the end the market is global and we are still relatively small.
@_date: 2014-05-21 02:03:33
Hello Olivier,
As I sent you in the pm, I would like to participate.
My pitch:
* Use stealth addresses for voting the board members. They are useful because they guard the fundamental aspect of democracy: the private vote. 
* The candidates and members of this distributed foundation will be eponymous persons. All the names are posted online.
* The board members are 7 to break ties and to honor Satoshi for using Secp256k1 (ref. y^2 = x^3 + **7**).
* Each board member has an equal vote (also based on stealth addresses) for the decisions of this young foundation.
* All board meetings are public and are posted online.
* The board members are not compensated while serving term, as it is assumed that they have incentive to proliferate Bitcoin technology to the benefit of our world.
* Each board member's stealth address is a key in a 5-of-7 scheme that unlocks the foundation's deposits
* The majority of the board is needed to unlock the funds gathered from the members subscriptions and donations
* The board is elected every year though the blockchain.
* A regular member pays minimum of 0.05 BTC for a yearly subscription or 1 BTC for life membership
* A special kind of membership is for the industry companies and the cost is 3 BTC per year. Silver, Gold and Platinum exposures are possible, for additional revenue.
* All rates are a minimum and halve every 4 years.
* The industry elects 3 of the 7 board members, the rest 5 are elected from all the members
* All software is open source and part of it runs on the Bitcoin blockchain.
I am also open to collaborations with skillful hackers.
Also I think it is good to escrow the 200 BTC, what do you think?
Edit: formatting and question about using an escrow.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:44:36
It's not we vs them, it's about cryptos in general.
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:03:14
Bitcoinj already used deterministic signatures so wallets like Android Bitcoin wallet, Multibit, Coinomi are covered.
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:04:38
You can also try Coinomi.
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:13:55

In Nigeria they even use Facebook, India is the global center for development outsourcing, etc.
Technology becomes cheaper and cheaper. On the long run cryptos will beat so much the existing regime that in the end they will embrace it, some will become obsolete. Cryptos are like the Linux, like the Internet, just a piece of technology that humanity created.
@_date: 2014-08-17 11:27:37
We are still in the phase that people think that Bitcoin != Dogecoin != Litecoin != Etherium != etc...

This inaccurate, segwit is orthogonal to a block size increase, with the effective size going up to a theoretical 8mb (assuming heavily usage of complex scripts).
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:55:10
You make a valid point about security and consumer protection. 
I am working on my startup for decentralized trading and decentralized dispute resolution.
Also the next generation wallets will be a hybrid of web/physical where you hold a piece of the private key, a piece your wallet provider, and a third piece you can keep as a backup. You would need 2 out of 3 keys to make any transaction (can be M of N, see [BIP0011](
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:21:57
Our mistake was the block size fixation and not the fundamental problem of the inefficient p2p block propagation.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:31:53
Like others said, wallet is when you control your private keys. Try wallets like Trezor, Mycelium or Coinomi (I am the co-founder of the last one). Those wallets will generate a "recovery phrase" that you must absolutely write down somewhere and keep very secure as it is needed to restore your wallet in case you lose or break your device. If you are new, enjoy cryptos!
@_date: 2016-06-20 21:33:38
What BIP44 derivation path are you using for ethereum?
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:29:56
The above path is used in other implementations and we are going to use it as well. It's nice to be interoperable.
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:11:28
Is it for the block propagation and consensus latency?
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:10:28
Check this: 
Please avoid the Jaxx implementation as it uses multiple receiving addresses that don't work so well in Ethereum (account-based, no change outputs). The preferred path is m/44'/60'/account_index'/0.

You cannot control where the users are getting the APK from and the vast majority never heard of "Coinomi" to understand which version is the legit one. I agree with you that open source is better though.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:43:09
I didn't argue that you cannot do it but that is more work that if you have the code.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:54:13
It's because BCH has a its own BIP44 path but to see the BTC-&gt;BCH he needed to use Bitcoins' path.
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:54:43
Not going to comment on the open source stuff but the wallet is keeping the private keys on device and optionally the user can encrypt them using Scrypt key stretching and AES in CBC mode for private key encryption. It access the network using electrum servers. Granted it is as secure as the underlying operating system.
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:37:47
The coins should appear immediately after the loading is complete. Did you had Bitcoins in Coinomi before the fork? Go to the overview and long press your Bitcoin account, then the options menu (3 dots), then account details. Is the Derivation path the same as in the BitcoinCash account?
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:58:27
Apparently you have never tried to start your own business that is based open source and competitors are constantly created by stealing your code.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:28:16
They removed it because it's not open source anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:20:21
You need advanced knowledge to do that, with the source code available you only need Android Studio and pressing Build -&gt; Generate Signed APK.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:16:55
Please feel free to not use it, as you are free to not use anything that you cannot compile yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:05:38
You can use the same recovery phrase to restore your Mycelium wallet in Coinomi and then use the path trick to see your coins. If you send BTC from Mycelium it will not send the BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:47:18
The company needs to keep the development going on, pay for the electrum servers and keep copycats at bay (there were at least two occasions where a clone was stealing private keys and they didn't even bother to change the Coinomi support email). I do think it sucks that the code is not public but the alternative is not to have that wallet at all.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:57:21
The reason people use it is because it is a convenient wallet: Securely store Bitcoin and altcoins without syncing GB's of data and use a standard compliant BIP32/39/44 recovery phrase to be able to use it in compatible wallets (no vendor lock-in like in some other wallets).
As for the irony, this may help you get it 
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:44:24
Try restoring with Coinomi wallet, it uses the same BIP39 recovery phrase.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:26:40
You should see the same addresses for both coins (double check by going to the receive screen and "Previous addresses" if needed). If the addresses are the same then it means that you didn't have Bitcoins in your Coinomi wallet before the fork, for example if you sent your Bitcoins after the fork. If that is the case, you need the original private keys of your previous wallet, there is an option in the balance screen by pressing the menu button (3 dots) and "Sweep wallet".
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:35:51
Please don't spread FUD, it is a registered UK company with public founders (plus the users hold their private keys on device). If you wanted to do something malicious you could just compile a backdoored version and publish it on the Play store, you don't need to close the source code (or you would attract suspicions).
@_date: 2015-08-31 23:30:57
They use a different token technology Colored Coins (Open Asset Protocol) VS Omni (ex-Mastercoin).
Another difference seems to be that hey are not issuing the tokens themselves or holding the fiat deposits in their bank account. They probably have a bank partner that does this.

Good stuff. I took a quick look of the Greenbits code and was expecting some kind of binary blob. Are you adding it when building the app?
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:46:16
Sigmike created a very powerful behaviour driven integration tests for NuBits. Maybe Bitcoin could copy some of that

Check the Coinomi wallet, it supports multiple coins with a bip44 keychain.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:07:09
Those wallets use the BIP44 standard so you can use the same recovery phrase in both wallets.
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:41:35
Should be working now. Thanks for reporting!
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:06:58
How does it work?
@_date: 2015-07-26 22:50:32
Usually this happens when I am on a very slow connection like GPRS but even in that case it takes no more than 5-10 seconds. It's strange that took so much time, can you try again to restore it? Also what is your device? Maybe the wallet is a bit heavy for it...
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:41:14
Most people 1) don't know about it and 2) cannot exchange to it due to capital controls
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:00:20
The user. It uses the BIP44 standard so it is compatible with the Trezor hardware wallet (Bitcoin only).
@_date: 2015-07-06 12:47:47
Are you referring to the Bitcoin transactions?
Although unusual, big confirmation delays happen on the blockchain.
edit: 16 hours ago, the news about the Greek referendum came out and there was a huge transaction volume that filled up completely the 1mb Bitcoin blocks.

Coinomi is working on it.

Maybe you entered your recovery phrase as a password by mistake? The recovery phrase (bunch of words) is used as a backup method, while the password encrypts your wallet for spending protection and can be anything you want.
@_date: 2016-09-16 13:02:10
This depends on the application. You have to check the presence of:
    android:allowBackup="false"
In the AndroidManifest.xml of the wallet source code. I know that Schildbach's android Bitcoin wallet and Coinomi don't allow remote backups.

Coinomi stores your keys locally optionally encrypted. For a backup it gives you a bip39 recovery phrase that you should keep in a secure place in case you lose your device.

It's possible to compile java to native code using tools like RoboVM.
The extensions iirc are for the UTXO queries to speed up the protocol operations and are not required.

The seed is compatible with the coinomi wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-12 09:19:47
Check out also the Coinomi wallet, it is a simple "spartan" wallet that uses an HD key-chain to manage all the private keys (BIP44 compatible) and has integrated the ShapeShift exchange.

At any point you _can_ broadcast an old transaction that has more coins for you, however the other party can take all the coins as a punishment for the breach of the contract. This works by using hashed values (and revealing the values for old transactions) and time locks (you can't immediately spend the coins if you broadcast the old transaction but the other party can, and vice versa).
@_date: 2015-09-01 10:38:41
If Alice buys fiat CC from you (after doing KYC/AML), she could sell the tokens to the money launder Bob and the money will circulate until someone has to redeem it. Does this person inherits the "sins" of the previous bearers? Or simply put, are the tokens fungible?
@_date: 2015-11-30 09:44:34
Sure (and it is great security) however if you use a browser that has a malware extension that changes all the addresses in a page with one from the attacker, you will lose the coins as they never arrived to their true destination.
This is a more fundamental problem with addresses: who is the ultimate beneficiary? BIP70 solves this issue by using [PKI](
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:58:48
While Trezor provides strong security, I would still be careful of not using it on a device that I don't trust.
Malware can change the addresses that a user sees on their screen and it can spy their balance. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:27:23
Yes, the address where the coins will be sent is displayed on the screen. I was referring to the situation where the address in the malware ridden computer is changed to benefit the attacker.
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:54:41
Check also Coinomi, it allows users to control their own keys and keep various crypro-currencies.
@_date: 2015-11-19 17:47:36
Correct, 12 words computer generated words provide 128 bits of entropy + 4bits checksum when using BIP39.
However it is a bad idea to not back it up, you need to type the phrase often to strengthen the memory but typing it often increases the chance of compromise.
When I was developing Coinomi, I played a memory game with a friend to try to remember a 12 or 15 word phrase. One was dictating a word and the other had to repeat it, if it was correct repeat the first word and reveal the second and so on. To learn the sequence took something like 5-10 minutes, however we failed to remember it after a couple of hours; some parts of the sequence where correct but not overall (I knew because the checksum was incorrect).
TLDR learning and retaining random data is hard.
@_date: 2015-11-19 17:48:43
No, it doesn't support BIP32 (yet).
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:40:02
The [BIP44 spec]( has a link with a list of all the registered coin types, currently maintained by Satoshi Labs. Normally the list should be in the BIP44 repository but it was decided to keep it separate for efficiency.
@_date: 2015-11-18 16:42:13
The HD versions of Electrum and Multibit are using BIP32 for private key deprivation while Trezor and Coinomi use BIP44 (technically it's the same algorithm but different key hierarchy structure). Another difference is that Multibit is using a Bitcoinj wallet file (compatible with the Android Bitcoin wallet of Andreas Schildbach) and Electrum has it's own algorithm to generate the master private key  (correct me if I'm wrong). Trezor is using BIP39 to derive the master key.
Mycelium is another wallet that supports BIP39/BIP44 recovery phrases.
@_date: 2015-11-11 00:21:10
With normal blocks I meant key blocks that are produced by other miners.
So it seems that most of the coins disappear with the prisoner getting a 5% of the value. Another thing that wasn't discussed is that the miner can just copy the info about the double spent micro block and get the reward herself instead of the original reporter (maybe only the miners can be true reporters?).
Generally it's a solid paper that solves a serious issue with big blocks and adds the nice feature of safer 0-confs.
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:44:37
Try Coinomi, it's a true BIP44 wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-12 10:13:45
Not necessarily. Somebody could use 2 different BIP39 passwords for their recovery phrase. Each password creates a different wallet and only one could be revealed that contains few coins.
@_date: 2015-11-20 07:22:41
IIRC you can recover with your custom phrase and it will warn you that the phrase is invalid and I'd you want to continue or not. Not all wallets allow custom phrases though.
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:45:37
No, if the miner double spends and penalized the history stays the same i.e. no transaction is reverted. Also keep in mind that a poison tx can be added to the blockchain up to 100 blocks later.
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:54:54
1. We still want to keep the normal  blocks produced after the attacker's block
2. Yes it adds a risk, so when accepting high value payments one should wait &gt;6 key blocks. The micro blocks have slightly better security than 0-conf payments.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:19:04
Not taking a side here, but it is possible:
@_date: 2015-11-19 14:49:13
You mentioned a decentralized exchange and smart contracts, could you provide technical details?
@_date: 2015-11-20 00:25:40
In a sense you are right because it uses the bip32 derivation algorithm. However BIP44 uses a different path m/44'/cointype'/account'/ than the one proposed in BIP32 m/account'/.
@_date: 2015-03-16 12:23:05
Regarding the 2nd point, it could be improved if the offline decrypting computer signed a pre-made transaction that it scanned from a qr-code and then showed the signed the transaction as qr-code. In that case the private keys stays temporary in memory and the signing computer could make some checks like address whitelisting.
@_date: 2015-11-18 14:33:20
Trezor uses the BIP39 and BIP44 standards to create a random phrase that produces all your private keys, so if you lose your device but have written your phrase or remember it you can recover all your funds. There are also other wallets compatible with it. You can see for yourself by using this tool 
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:41:56
Thanks for being awesome!
@_date: 2015-10-30 22:22:43
A simple solution would be using a password protected private key. So additionally to the qr code the host could orally announce the password. Now this can be also gamed by using speech recognition but it is a bit more challenging.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:25:05
Here is the spec 
Be really careful with BIP39 passphrases, we had Coinomi users that enabled it and forgot it. Without it the recovery phrase is useless.
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:11:21
Hehe, got to increase the awareness a bit! We will keep improving, personally my biggest need is simple to use multisig.
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:38:34
This happens sometimes with the integrated ShapeShift exchange when you exchange large amounts of alt-coin to Bitcoin.
Coinomi and Mycelium use the same BIP44 wallet structure so you can use your Coinomi recovery phrase in Mycelium! I use Coinomi on Android and Mycelium on iOS using the same recovery phrase.
@_date: 2015-10-30 22:10:13
Good ideas. In the latest release the BIP39 password protection is better explained however I still think some people will enable it and forget it, hopefully less this time. BIP39 password is one of these features that is very powerful and dangerous at the same time.
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:31:03
Check out Coinomi that lets you control your own private keys and store other coins as well. Additionally it has integrated the ShapeShift exchange. (Disclaimer: I made it)
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:55:46
Coinomi is BIP44 compatible. Additionally Mycelium and Samurai wallet are compatible. It is nice that with the same recovery phrase I get to see my coins in other wallets.
Edit: added other wallets
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:43:47
Sure but you get the point.
@_date: 2015-02-14 13:15:36
Yes the grouping is the problem.
There are also other privacy issues with bitcoin in general, like the fact that money received with 2 addresses can be combined in one transaction that effectively tells us that the owner is the same.
@_date: 2015-11-11 00:52:27
Good point on the gaming of the micro block system.
The NG has better characteristics for the consensus latency, fairness, hash power utilization when dealing with higher throughput. However it also seems to have limits so it definitely must be combined with something like lightning...
@_date: 2015-11-13 21:06:41
If you mean in Trezor, I guess so. In Coinomi you can optionally set a BIP39 passphrase and separately a password to encrypt the wallet. The encryption password can change, the BIP39 is permanent and it's needed to restore. You can test your recovery phrase using this [tool]( you can also save this html file and open it in an offline computer.
@_date: 2015-02-24 02:35:16
Coinomi wallet!
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:49:35
Did you exchange the coins through ShapeShift? What was the original trade? Did ShapeShift return your funds?
@_date: 2015-02-24 02:28:48
Check out also the Coinomi wallet! It uses hierarchical deterministic keys and by default encrypts them on the device.
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:16:03
It's fixed now but it could happen again if there is a &gt;100 block reorg. The reason is that the electrum server we are using is hardcoded to a 100 block reorg limit but I am going to submit a patch to make it configurable.
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:41:09
What about Coinomi?
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:33:11
It's safe but be sure to:
- backup your recovery phrase (extra points if you actually try to restore)
- set a password that encrypts your private keys
- use an up to date Android system 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:36:08
Check that you have a reliable connection with the Electrum servers and that the height you see in the wallet is the same as you see on a public block explorer. In any case, you can [extract]( your private keys as the wallet is using BIP32/39/44 standards.
