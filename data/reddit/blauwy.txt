Im with you, 100%.
But, you're getting nowhere with discussing TA on this sub. I've tried, and time and time again, never goes anywhere, sadly.

Well, here we was, having an adult discussion. It was fun while it lasted. 
You just justified my initial impression of you. Good luck in your trading.

No, its not.
Its 98% manipulated right now. Look at the chart; from april 1st the big players started buying and selling in big chunks. Almost on cue every day since. Big chunk of BTC bought -&gt; accumulate a few hours -&gt; dump. Rinse and repeat. Everything in between the dumps are bot trading against each other. 
Massive candles like this cant and wont last. We will retrace to 6400 and possibly a lot lower very soon. Of course, I want to see BTC rise and make money like crazy. But this kind of fast and controlled spikes are not the indication of a new bull market at this point.

Alright man, you do what you feel is right. Im just saying; we are being played right now. There's a clear difference between price action in march and now.
Thousands of people cant, and arent, spiking it the price at *the exact same time* multiple times a day.
Also, its widely acknowledged that whales are buying and selling in chunks at the moment.
But again; it this works for you, keep at it.
