My biggest concern with Bitcoin is the size of the blockchain. It's not getting any smaller. It's already at over 200 GB and is growing 52.5 GB a year. In 10 short years, it will be well over 3 TB.
How can we fix the problem? 
How about bitcoin masternodes with the sole purpose of holding a full copy of the blockchain, and everyone else can run a trunacated version of it, that can refrence a masternode for any tranactions older than a year?

Depends on what year you plan on time traveling back to. I’d personally go back to 2011. A $100 investment would make you a bazillionare today.

Run the miner as a service so it starts mining in the background.

I think it was my post you didn’t understand. I was trying to explain that whoever was dumping all those bitcoins, it created a more supply than demand situation. If they continue to dump them, expect the price to go down even more.

Just because it’s not to your liking, doesn’t mean it’s FUD. This is what happens when supply is greater than demand.

Every time socialism attempts anything, you get Venezuela. Every socialist led country has ALWAYS failed. There isn't a blockchain in the world that can fix Venezuela. The people must rise, drive the socialist dictator out, and establist a democratic governement. And I don't mean a DEMOCRAT government. Democrats are not democratic. They're socialists. EVERY SINGLE city in the USA that is in debt is run by a democrat. Truth hurts.

It’s overbought on the daily. Doesn’t necessarily mean I’m right. Hopefully it will continue its climb. But if it were a stock, I’d stay away until it’s not so overbought.

The only person who I know who went for a week and a half without checking the price of btc was by brother who got hit by a car in a crosswalk, and was in a medically induced coma for 10 days. What do you think his first question was when he came to??

If you spend it and buy it at the same time... what’s the point?? Just hold. If you spend $100 of btc, and buy $100 to replace it, you still have a hundred dollars of btc, unless the price goes up or down of course between spending and buying. It’s like daylight savings. A wise Indian chief once said, only the US government would think you can cut a foot off the bottom of a blanket, sew it to the top, and have a longer blanket.
