Anyone have a step by step on setting up a LN hub on mainnet? Are there considerations (money trading licenses, ext..?).

What happened to Gavin? What a great proponent for BTC but that candle is now out

If I don’t know the answer I ask the question....

Great post, let's get Etherium off the ground. Apply pressure

Ah ok I will look into that client.  Thanks for the heads up.

Oh and I most certainly did not transfer/spend 12+ BTC, so that transaction if it shows up was unauthorized? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:33:07
Thank you so much for the prompt and excellent info. 1 beer
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:36:08
It is yeah.  3673 blocks to go.  I have transactions and blockchain post the Feb change withdrawl so I think this is just a case of me learning something new :)  Thanks so much for your help.

Jesus...how did this not come up in the last few years.  Heart attack averted I guess!
When I followed the transaction trail of those hidden addresses it does show a lot of BTC moving around, does this mean that everyone has those same addresses as hidden local addresses?
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:21:54
It does say that the last transaction was 21 days ago and it is updating from there.  I have multiple transactions in April of this year, where as the big withdrawl was in feb?

@_date: 2014-07-01 21:21:52
I think I understand the concept.  But if my balance is showing 13+ BTC, and the blockchain.info shows the address as only having 3+ BTC....what is my actual BTC amount?
@_date: 2011-06-10 07:50:07
Are you in a pool or solo mining?  How many btc per day are you pulling?

Ah ok.  Thanks so much for the reply!

Well they do have chips, and they have proven demo's.  My concern is related to the Bitcoin market when all this GH/s boxes hit the market.
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:16:24
Wow.  None of this popped up in my research. I research bad.  Guess I should cancel/stop order.  
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:10:58
Wouldn't it be .02?
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:42:12
Today I noticed that the money (even though I paid paypal) was not removed from my credit card.  I removed that available balance from my credit card, and now it cannot process.  They have not responded to my emails.  Kinda leerly that they have an authorization, but I'll work with CC card regarding purchase if it some how goes through.

I'm currently mining LTC on my rig, 5800x.  With the ASIC box I'll see better returns on BTC
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:15:54
As mentioned in title.  Currently I have 4 BTC.  I mine Litecoin/Bitcoin everyday.  I've ordered the linked unit.  When will I receive it?  What kind of return will I see?  Speculate!
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:05:48
Did they process the refund?  I'd purchase some new vid cards but my current box only has PCIE 2.0 so no 7 series :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:47:47


@_date: 2013-04-08 07:53:50
Yeah from what I've read the FPGA's were re-branded.  I've asked for a refund until they have items ready for ship.  I'll keep you posted.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:15:25
Roger.  Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:53:12
They issued a full refund and wanted to know what the 'fraud' was as they had not heard of it yet.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:01:06
At this point I've ordered, but no payment through paypal has gone through yet.  I havn't spent any money.  I also sent an email to BFL asking for a refund.  I'm just not 100% confident in the team behind it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:29:30
I dunno.  Getting some buyer remorse here as none of these have actually shipped and there is now significant community concern this is all a scam.  It is in paypal's hands right now, I could either cancel credit card or try and work with BFL to stop the order.  Or take the gamble and hope it ships?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:15:13
Thanks for the reply.  I checked my address against blockchain.info and the size I expected is there.
