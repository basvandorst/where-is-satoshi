Yep, 
Based on almost no evidence I predict a high of 14k. Upvotes please.

 So to short on bitcoin I'd have to predict the loss, as in say what I think bitcoin will reduce down to? Or can put in an investment that pays out the percent bitcoin goes down... to pay out at a later date?

I did for ether. full of regret because now i want crypto kittens. I may have bought back in. I can't remember if my buy order was at 440 or 430 ... I changed it too many times to remember. Will let you know once I get home. Stay tuned remember to breath. 
Nope:Full regret

What you suggest would be fine. Easy to transfer as you say because you are sending to any address so all you need is the wallet secured. My advice would be test out how it works with small amounts. Don't worry about security as much as losing the usb.

...bitcoin gold?

The best advice is as follows. Don't try and predict the market. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose. 
What will happen on the 18th... nothing on the grand scheme of the market.

...so what you are saying is Half-Life 3 is confirmed.

I personally do not. Mainly because I do not know when the market will drop or pump. 
If you treat crypto like a normal investment then it should be a long time between you touch anything. But if you want to day/hour trade then perhaps your method may be fine.

 You should sell, short on futures and rebuy at 8k. Enjoy the moon.

Told my parents to buy the dip after 2x. now it's hard to justify. They wont believe the it'll keep going argument. Maybe I'll show them the full Shila vid.

 This is how I feel on btg.

Buy a usb wallet - leger send to be popular. Other people I have seen print out hard wallets on paper and either hide it in a safe or etch the key into aluminium. Depends how creative you want to be.

 kinda relieved the alts will have a chance now. But this is going to continue to happen. People saw 2x and btg push the price way up at the cost of alts. My only hope is that future forks and "forks" will be less effective at manipulating the market.
