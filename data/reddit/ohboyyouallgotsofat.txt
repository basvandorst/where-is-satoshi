I went through a treatment for PTSD, called EMDR, or, eye movement desensitization reprogramming. And let me tell you, it was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life, I ended up locked in my therapists bathroom. 10/10 would not do it again, any alternatives would be really appreciated

It’s a 10% dip, seems like pretty standard deviation tbh

It’s because coinmarketcap stopped accounting my for Korean markets in their averages so it looks like everything is crashing, which is causing people to panic sell, which is causing it to actually crash... very irresponsible move by them

PTSD happens from many things outside of war, it is not only something soldiers experience. Although they are the most well known sufferers

Idk. EMDR can go wrong really easily and send you into a blackout panic/rage. It sounds like mdma therapy on its own might be fine as is

Are we just going to ignore the fact that he called it “the great Election”

I have a good feeling that’s exactly what happened

Well they were all there to watch it get tortured so I don’t feel that bad?

The price wasn’t actually 1 dollar. It was a glitch in your wallet not in the price of bitcoin
