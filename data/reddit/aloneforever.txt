Hear hear good friend.

I'm running it, but you might have already guessed that.

Not to sound like a jerk, but my target audience is the sort of people who are comfortable with a bit of coding and running a couple containers.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:43:20
I'm not sure I agree, but I don't know enough about their internal implementation to really comment. I suspect, however, that it's a pile of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:06:10
Is it really? Bitcoin core devs seem to have already done the heavy lifting.

You have to use the console to generate a segwit address. It's not supported from the UI. Here are some instructions: 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:56
Where did you find that information?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:17:28
That has nothing to do with coinbase's ability to use the API.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:40:41
It does what it's supposed to do.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:37:38
Nope. You get USD, not BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:20:51
You should have spent some money on a safe and hardware wallet. Would've been cheap insurance.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:47:35
This is strictly for buying, and it's not really doing anything fancy or sophisticated.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:44:32
Fair enough, but that's just semantics.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:58:04
Agreed, but we're a long way off from this. The US gov will not want this to happen, and they have a military with drones and nuclear weapons.
Perhaps some day their dollar will become so worthless that they won't be able to pay the military anymore, and the old conservative white dudes running the world will all be dead and we'll actually have a real democracy instead of the sham that exists today.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:40:06
Right, which is stupid on their part. If they just stuck to the official Bitcoin implementation they wouldn't have a bunch of pissed off customers.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:21:04
Tom Lee is a fantastic spokesperson for Bitcoin. Well spoken, good at boiling down the concepts, and approachable to the 'regular Joe' investor. We should be trying to get this guy more airtime.

It's just setting up some buy orders at the current price with a 0.5, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, and 0.45% discount, with each order having a size of 1/5th the target amount to purchase.

For everyone jumping in the thread here saying how great this is, please keep in mind that these futures will be **cash settled**. In other words, if you buy a future, you will receive cash instead of BTC upon delivery.
So...what does that mean? It means that someone can buy $1bn worth of BTC, and CME will earn commission, but it will actually have no effect on the supply of BTC. In that sense, this is bad for Bitcoin. It means this is a purely speculative platform, and anyone buying BTC through these futures is not actually using BTC or affecting the market.
If people are buying BTC and hodling it, through normal BTC markets, this would limit the supply and thus drive up the price.
Whether or not this is actually good for Bitcoin remains to be seen.

Thanks for that valuable insight.

@_date: 2018-05-24 19:49:30
It's just meant to be fun. I don't see why you feel the need to shit all over it. Do what feels right, though.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:01:50
Fair enough. I don't literally think people shouldn't sell, it's intended to be viewed as philosophy but not as hard and fast rules.
If you need to sell some coin to feed yourself or pay rent, then please do.
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:58:14
Thanks again.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:08:16
I appreciate the humble reply by the way. I understand that it may get tiring sifting through all the memes.

I'm really suspicious of the giant circlejerk around Casa. Their node product is a $300 rasppi, and their multisig product is no better than the free equivalents such as electrum. I am baffled by the number of people on Twitter and elsewhere who keep promoting their products for free.
I'm happy to be proven wrong about them, but I don't see much value in what they offer (yet).

When will KeepKey support segwit?
I'd use a Ledger instead if they weren't backordered.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:21:56
I ordered mine from  A+ would use again

The world will be better off if crooks like Jamie Dimon revert to being cavemen.

My post didn't get much traction, but I figured I'd mention it.

There's an alternate theory here which is that Bitcoin is stable, and fiat currency is not. Bitcoin has a fixed supply, whereas fiat currency can be created (or destroyed) in unlimited quantities at the whim of central banks.
(Although realistically I don't think we're actually living in that world yet.)
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:37:08
That sub is pretty crappy. It doesn't mean much. Even people on hacker news hate (and completely misunderstand) Bitcoin, and they're certainly more intelligent than the general population.

Nothing else in my life is as exciting as the kind of math they're doing on the moon these days.

I think we're probably going to see $500k before we see $5.
It's not impossible though.

Glad I'm not the only one:

It was done by a friend who's an artist (with some direction from me), but yes it's original.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:22:44
IMO the price volatility just reflects the 'cost' of adoption or uptake of the currency. It'll eventually settle out as some portion of global GDP, and the price relative to fiat currencies won't fluctuate nearly as much.
It's also possible that in the future prices could be computed in real time, rather than being relatively stationary as we see today. Maybe the price of a hot dog will float depending on current market conditions?
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:04:55
Yes, it's a bad idea to keep your coins on any exchange, including Coinbase. You should use a wallet where you own the private keys. You can use the official Bitcoin Core wallet, or a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S.
If you don't own the private keys, then you don't actually own the coins.

He actually said "I could care less", which is grammatical nonsense. Doesn't inspire confidence in his intelligence.
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:07:15
This is presumably based on their cash-settled futures? If so, it doesn't mean that much for Bitcoin as it will not affect supply. It's merely a new revenue source for Cboe.
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:29:14
I'm not questioning that, but the fact remains: a cash settled future does not directly affect Bitcoin supply.
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:50:09
Well in that case, make sure you have your moon suits ready.
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:17:14
To a much lesser degree than those who buy and hold (i.e., remove supply). The price is primarily determined by the supply and demand of an asset, not by market fluctuations or arbitrage.
