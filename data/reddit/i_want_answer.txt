should we generalize all alts to this? i'm in the market for a couple of years now and I don't think some (ofc they are a small percentage but that's obvious since we have almost 3k different coins) are centralized companies.
Are you talking about ETH for example? I dont quite understand the generalization
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:37:55
I would reply to this but I dont want to lose more karma, I actually appreciate to be in conversations about this, so I kinda need that. 
Thanks for ur answer, I'll just disagree.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:47:57
so, finally somebody that kinda understands about technical stuff.
your comment was really good btctakeoverfiat, the only big problem I think you are missing (because you want to miss it on purpose) is that bitcoin can be as centralized as ETH if not already, since there is more desirability in dominating the mining of a coin like bitcoin than eth.
The thing is, I agree that bitcoin is not one of those "shitcoins" but I totally disagree on the generalization of all alts to shitcoins. Makes 0 sense, even tho bitcoin is the king, the truth is there are coins trying to for example implement protocols where the inevitable centralization can't even happen.
Let's not be delusional and say bitcoin is decentralized just because you don't need that much money to play with a node.

these noobs are like bullish TA :D

Well you could say that nowadays there are more hacks but you could also say that CRYPTOcurrency has the best security technology in the world.
Population is going to jump aboard because they will not be boomers (or at least with boomer mentality), they will understand that a digital store of value in the digital age beats a golden stone from the stone age.
Also, to answer that philosophical question, everything is speculative to a big extent and adoption comes when the speculation is so huge that anyone can't handle not adopting. 
It's like a trend but with real technological value behind it.

look guys, a non-technical guy on the top of the bandwagon! Upvote him, he likes bitcoin and talks trash about every alt because he thinks he knows about their specs!

can I ask you fellows why not transfer to paypal? I thought it was way faster but I might be wrong since I've only taken profits once there.

then you probably notice something explaining your doubt on the XBT/USD chart. if you don't, then you don't do TA good enough to be saying you do TA at all. Listen this is not personal at all, it's just that you come here to reddit where 99% of people don't know sh\*\* about TA (not even the fundamentals) asking the type of question that people that are totally lost ask.
If you don't understand nothing about price action there is absolutely no problem (since most people just invest because "yes" and "looks good investment") but you probably shouldn't be worried about this type of question and just let it run in the long term.
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:50:29
did I mention people on reddit general?
I think I was talking about foxy denied facts. I am not smarter or dumber than people on reddit. I'm trying to convince you about something that you can actually profit from.
Call me your friend
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:10:39
don't worry, people like him are delusional uneducated sad people. don't waste your fingers in people that actually think the movements are caused because of the direction of the wind provided by god's fart.
@_date: 2019-08-11 03:00:35
well I will just say people should probably wait to see what happens by the end of this downtrend.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:02:22
listen, i'll just say I hope someday you understand that people like me are not interested in starting a fight on reddit with other people that think they have to get a crystal ball to understand and predict the markets with very decent accuracy. keep believing in fairy tales instead of analytical science.
and try to explain to us why there are loads of firms that have the one and only purpose of trading that make millions everyday, or are you saying they have a crystal ball to be landing that large amount of "good calls"?
i wont answer more about this since there is no way to convince people like you with that huge ego based on thin air and lost money specially when they have no education on the topic and are just spamming reddit with shots about how bad is trading.
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:42:20
search and find some decent TA, understand it and then ask stupid questions like that again
@_date: 2019-08-11 03:08:25
Just like a lot of things in life, it's not just knowing it and it's done. there's levels of everything, like let's take this example: you were probably never good with math but you passed. is that enough to be telling your parents you have a valid basic knowledge of math concepts? sure, but your friend Edward who had the max grade understands way more than you, being able to have better results. 
TA is an analytical skill that requires you to know and understand a lot of concepts that are not just out there like your primary level of math. So besides your disability, lack of understanding and lack of motivation to learn, I would say that most people don't have access to good education regarding TA (unlike institutional level traders who make their companies close to what you call "infinite wealth", since you probably think infinite is just a big number).
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:24:45
:) as I expected. Cya
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:49:49
you are not reading pal, institutional trading firms is all the 'backing' needed
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:18:22
are you trolling? how do you think institutional trading is done? yolo plans? buying into just news? TA is a major part of price action wether you like it or not. If you don't know how to understand charts and draw some important lines it's your problem loser. 
these delusional people are truly a joke. anyone saying TA provides 0 value is just another uneducated person that actually doesn't know anything about trading and investments. they just buy at a price they feel like it's good and sell the same way. guess what, the best places to buy and sell are based on TA and you are just too dumb to understand the levels and patterns the charts tell you and that are respected along any fractals.

I know that it’s a known stradegy, but I do not agree most people follow it. I think you can think that and we can agree on disagree
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:42:07
obviously this is useless miss leading info. I get what he is saying is "true", but we all know this is not how it works, ever. It's like saying if you invest in this, it's always EASY money when you probably know it is not, and people buy and sell, probably not even 1% of all investors buy and hold. So the OP is milking likes in a reality that doesn't reflect 99% of the truth. 
It's one of those cringy low IQ threads that focus on positivity and not on facts.
We should all be positive about crypto, but with a brain. We don't need useless topics like this one. There are more reliable sources that apply to our reality that also show that Bitcoin is an AMAZING asset.
So chill out with the hate and the downvotes, idgaf about this karma system.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:03:22
OP, you are not smart, this post has 0 value. You are just another cringe wannabe "analytical" conclusion spammer with scuffed data. 
This is obviously bs, stop farming dumb upvotes from dumb people.
The only save for this post is some of the funny comments.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:47:21
this question is so dumb. it's just easy TA
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:12:24
now I would totally agree with your comment if it was written this way:

This answer is so dumb. Good TA just isn't easy to learn/find
