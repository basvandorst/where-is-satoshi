Hope you have a physical wallet

That's fine I'm just being real and saying it's a lot of volatility. 7k in a month is literally 100% increase

For real. Let him be happy owning a HOME. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:27
You should. It's way way too much speculating

So glad I did my transaction in BTC a few days ago. I figured there was going to be a drop and bought what I needed to before, thankfully

Sorry to be a noob, what is segwit?

To be honest fuck Goldman Sachs. They're damn good at influencing a market and commodities by relaying their opinion to the public. These are also the people who actively bet against the customers they brought in.

New to this and yes I hope it crashes but damn I initially needed to make a transaction and now the btc is fluctuating enough that I want to sit on it. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:09:01
This was my question too. So I should go Coinbase&gt;GDAX&gt;Mycelium?
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:55:45
Lol at very least 5200 before the next weekend n
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:19:06
Thank you. Just starting watching an hour long presentation on it from YouTube

Even if he understood it, i'm skeptical of him investing any serious amount because of the potential volatility/lack of insurance/market variance. Him jumping in would skyrocket the price though
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:36:36
If they bet against their customers you know Goldman's always betting for themselves.

One shitty post ever. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:09:33
... Just open a coinbase account and buy coins. Then store them
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:12:46
So I can actually buy an entire coin then lol
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:39:41
Fuck that Patriot act shit.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:38:16
LOL. Dude most people on this website are college kids. You think a bunch of 30+ year old people are the main stock of Bitcoin? Don't get offended I wasn't targeting you personally, and I don't live paycheck to paycheck. Maybe be more realistic and less rude.

Wait till we hit 4500 again from a dip in less than a week. Rebound effect happens all the time.

No mining is pointless now. It costs more to mine than mining gives you. Now you just buy like any other commodity and then hold it in a private wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:36:20
Is there a wiki on it? Mine is sitting in my Coinbase and Mycelium, haven't made a Myc backup yet 
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:30:30
Bro you bet the wrong way on a sure thing? It was his first real match and against a GOAT
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:37:29
If week one you bought $100 worth and then two days later it sank and jumped up 6 days later, you better wait 4 or 5 days for it to drop back to where it sank. Just heads up 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:10:29
Hodlers make enough to not want to take money out to pay bills lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:24:29
Hold BTC, use your other money to buy alt
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:04:17
&lt;3 u bb
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:16:50
Lol aka "I'm from r/all". Yes you should 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:13:06
I don't understand y'all. Just buy what you can. .01 counts
