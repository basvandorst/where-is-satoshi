It's the product of your labor, value that you've created. One of the beautiful things about crypto at a stable price is that it preserves that value, allows you to freely exchange that value, and protects that value from institutionalized theft. I believe in those things, but I don't think it's necessary to sacrifice all of my value to make that happen. 
Ultimately I think it's about a lot of people doing a little bit, our daily drippings fill bigger buckets than our geysers of effort. That means spending what you can without neglecting to get free of debt, establishing an emergency fund, and making traditional investments. If you gamble with everything and lose big you probably won't be back, but we're stronger if you invest in yourself first, are financially secure and can make small regular contributions to your crypto fund. It's possible to preserve and build wealth *reliably* if you take the middle path.
I'm eager for a world where I can safely convert everything to crypto, but that's not today.

It's interesting that some clever researchers generated charts of random data and presented technical analysts with them who were able to find patterns and give a commentary on the future of that particular market.
Doesn't discount it wholesale but chart analysis isnt a science, it's sophisticated guesswork. Accurate predictions are few but failures are dismissed ("Could never have anticipated X") and successes are celebrated in retrospect as confirmation that it works. It's not difficult to draw parallels between reading astrological charts and reading market charts.

Oh, my. It's value is as a settlement layer, as an investment it's extremely high risk, generally 5% of your total portfolio should be allocated to any one security. You leveraged yourself heavily in the hopes of getting rich quick, which seldom works. As difficult it may be to swallow, you gambled with *all* of your money. This is a direct result of your choices and you bear full responsibility, no point in trying to displace it on a meme.

Gemini is good, doesn't hold your money hostage for weeks. Can trade as soon as you make the ACH and transfer off the exchange as soon as the payment clears. Wire transfers deposit within a couple hours, a day at most, and crypto is available for immediate transfer.
Fees are much more reasonable on Gemini. Coinbase charges astronomical fees, pro.coinbase.com helps mitigate some fees, but you have to wait for the payment to settle into your account before you can use it and are still subject to random holds on moving them out of the exchange.

It is entirely safe, and necessary, to give your credentials to Coinbase. Their fees are pretty high, though. Your purchases are also subject to a mandatory hold on the exchange to prevent fraud, particularly if this is your first purchase. Once you have a verified account consider pro.coinbase.com if you really prefer to use that company to significantly reduce your fees which will quickly add up. Gemini and Bittrex also require verification of identity, are as trustworthy as any exchange can be, and allow immediate withdrawal once payment clears which is dependent on the payment type.
Debit cards are generally instantly cleared but are capped around 100$. ACH clears within 3-5 days, no minimum generally but capped 500-2k. Wire transfers clear within the day, may not have a lower limit (e.g. Coinbase) but often do in the 2k level and are capped on some exchanges but uncapped on others. Be aware there are daily withdrawal limits on some exchanges as well.
General advice on exchanges.   
I. Mind your fees! They can be a significant drain on your resources. Coinbase is amongst the worst for this.   
   II. If you don't have the private keys, you're not really in possession of the crypto. Mobilize your crypto off from exchanges ASAP. There's the infamous Mt. Gox hack (Google it), exit scams where exchanges are losing money (or plan it from the beginning) so they engineer  a "hack" that wipes out their customer's balances, you could inadvertently trigger "suspicious activity" in an algorithm somewhere and be locked out of your account with no ability to buy/sell/transfer. Some people have been locked out of accounts and thus their crypto for entire quarters or greater than a year...the list goes on.   
   III. There are a variety of wallet apps out there that you can use to store your crypto, probably any of them are safer than an exchange, ask around for recommendations. Consider a hardware wallet such as Ledger or TREZOR, but be aware that TREZOR One (oldest, cheapest model) is currently plagued by counterfeits if not purchased directly from the manufacturer.
GL in crypto, never spend what you can't afford to lose, some people suggest setting a budget and making small frequent contributions to their crypto fund rather than enormous purchases--your daily drippings will fill a bigger bucket than your geysers of effort (mortgaging your house to "go all in" is probably not a good idea)--and prices are probably headed lower before they begin to steadily rise so it will pay to wait for a clear trend reversal prior to making big purchases.

Anonymously as in no trail. It's about learning skills and exercising them all the time, not just when you're doing something you'd prefer people didn't know about. Privacy, particularly financially, is a privilege these days while I believe it's a right. It's one of the many benefits of crypto, but if you don't learn to use crypto then you're just going to be staring at a dollar figure on your coinbase app and stressing over it.
I could just as easily buy some government prohibited substance with bitcoin, but I was prescribed Norco once and that didn't go over well so I'm just a caffeine junkie. But say you want to send support to a controversial cause like WikiLeaks that your government would rather you didn't and has shut off all funding channels, Bitcoin can do that. Maybe you provide or need women's health services that are prohibited by your government, Bitcoin provides a way to access those services.

Agreed, OP understand correctly. 
The blockchain is the database of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). There are inputs and outputs. An UTXO is the product of an input. An input is a proposed change to the state of the blockchain which when verified creates a new UTXO. 
The way we interact with bitcoin gives us the impression that Aaliyah has this thing that she gives José, and for Bitcoin to work as a currency that's a perfectly adequate way to think about it; just as a patient with an infection doesn't need to understand the intricacies of how an antibiotic works for it be effective. That said, examining the intricacies of how a particular antibiotic works isn't pedantry, it helps understand how that drug may be applied to other organisms, how it may be improved, and when it may not work. 
So we may be satisfied, just as the patient that takes the antibiotic to "get better," that one user uses a wallet and "sends coins" to another wallet. Take a deeper dive and we have to examine what exactly a wallet is, which brings us right back to UTXOs because a wallet is a collection of private keys that give a user access to spend UTXOs by creating an input which proposes a change to the state of the blockchain, generating a new UTXO to which another user is granted access. Bitcoin, then, doesn't move from wallet to wallet but *from transaction to transaction* within the blockchain.
If we put all this together:
The state of the blockchain is a collection of UTXOs. UTXOs are bitcoin that have the potential to be spent. Private keys give access to UTXOs so the potential spend can be actualized in an input that then generates another UTXO for which someone else is given a key. Wallets collect private keys to UTXOs and display an aggregated balance of the UTXOs. 
So you never "hold" bitcoin, bitcoin lives as potential in UTXOs on the blockchain, you only hold a key that gives you the power to make a change to the state of the blockchain.

Depends on your personal circumstances. Crypto's high risk, are you comfortable taking that kind of risk with *all* of your money? There's nothing wrong with cutting your losses and you shouldn't beat yourself up over losing a couple percentage points even if this proves to be a miraculous rally and you have to buy in a bit higher. If the trend continues down then you get to buy back in at a lower price when there are clear indicators of a recovery.
As a general rule I do whatever is necessary to ensure my financial security, which includes diversifying my investments (5% is generally recommended in any one security) and cutting my losses when it's necessary. If I had all my money in crypto I would be very nervous right now. Very nervous.

Point is, people don't always make the best decisions when it comes to investing. If anything speculative trading of crypto is fine if that's your thing, but convincing everyone to leverage themselves for an enormous return on their investment is just...mean. Crypto is a tool whose value is not entirely stable yet, it's very risky and shouldn't comprise a large portion of your portfolio. You are much better off putting your retirement fund money in, say, a retirement fund at this point in the game.
Legitimately, if you're not comfortable putting it in a slot machine because of the risk involved or you haven't budgeted for a routine expenditure after you've made traditional contributions to your emergency fund and retirement then you shouldn't put it in crypto. It's not a sure thing. If you can routinely use it to pay for goods and services that changes things.

Cold storage on short notice is a challenge because you don't have any time to get a hardware wallet. That said you still have options.
Probably the easiest option is to generate a wallet on the Bitcoin Core app on an offline computer which will also generate a wallet address that you can send funds to. Use a strong pass*phrase*, you can query DuckDuckGo for how to best make secure passphrases, to encrypt the wallet files. Copy the wallet.dat file to an USB drive. Copy/paste the public address into a text file and save that on the USB drive as well. Delete wallet.dat from the computer. Backup your encrypted wallet.dat in several places for redundancy.
You can then send funds to the public address and setup a watching only wallet with the public address to keep track of UTXOs but there's no way to send out of the wallet. Improvements to that process can be suggested but it only increases the complexity, for example using a live linux OS to generate the wallet files and storing them in an encrypted db using something like KeePass. You will still be able to interact with your crypto so long as you have the USB drive, you'll just need to copy the wallet.dat file to the appropriate directory and launch Bitcoin Core remembering to copy it back to the USB and delete it from the host machine.
All that said, the only thing you need to regenerate your wallet is your seed phrase so you can follow the steps to create a wallet offline and rather than saving the wallet file you just delete it and save the public address for sending. Keep a couple Apocalypse proof copies of your seed phrase in different locations to recover access when you need it and setup a watching only wallet to monitor what you send to your public address. You can pick up a Dremel engraver or similar and some metal engraving plates from a hardware or craft store for like 25-ish fiat units and make your own seed phrase backups.

I would wager it's more about demonstrating how vulnerable less secure networks are and making the method to compromise them easily available for anyone who'd like to give it a go. I like the idea, kind of an anarchist's cookbook for crypto. 
If the experiment is going to succeed it needs to be resilient, and there's no higher authority than the longest chain.

Disagree. Making a gold coin so small that you could buy a glass of spirits without having to exchange and receive change was impractical. With silvers or coppers the problem was resolved to a degree but that didn't stop people from "coin clipping" coins into smaller fractions to pay for things. Copper pennies were actually what was used in most daily transactions, but "Copper to Bitcoin's Gold" doesn't quite have the same effect.
Thus, the value difference and the impracticality of physically dividing a coin at the point of sale is what really made other precious metals desirable as a means of exchange. Regardless of Bitcoin's value, its ethereal nature makes divisibility trivial. The simile does not stand up to scrutiny.

There's a mess of similar solutions. Just search Amazon for steel wallet crypto. For some insane reason they're 70-150$ Cheapest is a titanium wallet at 20 but you need to punch your own letters, set of punches costs another 20. With that amount of exertion blockplate is probably your best price/performance option if you want a commercial product.
If you're not averse to DIY and some effort just buy or borrow a Dremel Engraver (~$15-20) or buy the letter punches and shop around for a brass plate, ~$8 here:  Can be found smaller and cheaper. This way you have the tools to engrave/impress and can buy a few seed plates on the cheap if you would prefer not to keep all your eggs in one basket.
A more clever solution is to download this image of BIP-39 words, print it out, upload it to every cloud service and put it on every device. Then just engrave/impress the number attributed to the word on your backup.

Majority are open-source, which means you can review the code yourself. If you can't review the code you have to trust that someone else has, and the more popular the wallet the more confidently you can assume that someone who can make sense of it has done so.

As improbable as the hack would be to pull off, they still managed to find a vulnerability in the Ledger. That's pretty impressive. Independent review by security researchers who say, "We did our best, this is what we found" and having it be kind of underwhelming is actually *reassuring*. 
I don't know why hardware wallets aren't released with a rating or seal of approval from security researchers. People are expected to trust them with a significant amount of money, not sure what their process is but putting their product to the test before it comes to market, rather than customers finding out after the fact from security researchers or worse being subject to a hack, doesn't seem unreasonable.
My hope is that one day a wallet manufacturer will actively partner with people like Saleem or the wallet.fail trio and have the R&amp;D process be like a friendly competitive game. I'd probably watch it on YT if they'd stream it. At the end the consumer has one team, "We designed it...and redesigned it," and another team, "We kept fucking it up...until we couldn't" that results in a really great device that has been put to the test by the best.
I'd pay 200 for that device without blinking, could push it to 250 before I'd have to think about it. Brand identity means little compared to independent review. Safety, security, peace of mind is what I'm buying, not just a widget.

"Silver" is clever marketing as it implies that LTC has some essential function to perform in relation to BTC. LTC definitely has its uses, but it should stand on its own merits as a cryptocurrency rather than somewhat inaccurately hitching itself to Bitcoin's wagon in it's marketing material.

Mobile wallet app should do you fine. Variety of good ones out there. Off the top of my head, Mycelium, Samourai for privacy features, Eclair if you want to play with Lightning.
Storing your seed properly is the most important part. You cannot guarantee that you will not lose your phone, it may become damaged, or something like an app or OS update may bork your files. So long as you have your seed you can restore your keys, but if someone else gets it they can do the same.

@_date: 2019-01-01 13:01:34
There's some key differences between what's held by banks and exchanges that makes the difference. If fiat is stolen from your account by fraud or a security breach the bank generally just adds new numbers to your account and fiat is generally backed by some central bank insurance to prevent bank runs. The liquidity of banks is generally much higher, for example last I heard HSBC had a market cap of 200billion, nearly twice the market cap of all cryptocurrencies.
If crypto is stolen from your account it's irreversible, I'm not aware of an exchange that will use their own funds to top you up. If the theft happens on a large enough scale, even should an exchange make some vague promise of recompense, the exchange may be insolvent. 
Crypto also has unique properties that allow it to be exchanged person to person without any intermediaries determining if the payment is in accordance with their policies, political motivations, etc. If you want to send 100k to Taiwan on a Sunday you don't have to get anyone's approval, answer questions about what it's for, be subject to mandatory government reporting, etc. etc. You can't be locked away from your funds because you said something unfortunate a year ago and MasterCard decides they don't like you or law enforcement decides you're engaged in illegal activity by selling emergency contraception and it cant be confiscated should the authorities decide they have a claim to your assets.
Using an exchange as a bank puts exactly the same restrictions on your crypto as you have on your fiat. Exchanges have and do lock people out of their accounts for extended periods of time and because there is little regulation and their behavior is entirely dictated by their ToS there is no one to appeal to other than the exchange themselves, who are often as disinterested in helping their customers as they are concerned with protecting their own interests first and foremost.

OK, how about you don't. In order for people to adopt and use crypto they can't fear moving it off exchanges, and to accomplish that safely and securely is nerve wracking. The reason it is nerve wracking is because field reports pour in on a regular basis from people who have followed bad advice/procedures, precisely like what you're suggesting here. 
I and others routinely recommend hardware wallets because they represent a good balance between security and usability and for nearly everyone provide pretty good protection. The guided process for setup is designed to be easy and secure.
I also recommend more technically complex alternatives which don't need anything more than a couple USB drives, metal dog tags and an engraving pen but the majority of responses to those are muted.  
Paper wallets are [obsolete and unsecure]( are vulnerable to water damage, your printer represents the most significant vulnerability while your biggest concern is not plugging the USB drive back in, the user is expected to accurately hand type addresses, and so on. 
You may accept the risks, but recommending this process without clearly understanding the risks involved and failing to inform the reader of the risks, benefits, and alternatives so they can make an informed decision is borderline malicious.

I live primarily in an industrialized nation and had to travel to get it downloaded. Keeping it synced is easy enough after that, but may be a market for SSDs pre-loaded with the blockchain.

Yay! Super work on Wasabi. I usually send direct from an exchange to Wasabi before sending to a wallet. Is it safe/effective to do this? What would you recommend as an "ideal" procedure for anonymizing coin and maintaining that anonymity?

@_date: 2019-01-02 23:05:25
Full disclosure, I do not own this device, but have considered it. There are so many red flags I can't recommend it in good conscience. Any kind of antenna in the device makes it inherently unsecure. Worse, it has it's own power supply so the device could conceivably operate without any action by the user. It only works with a connection with a smartphone. I don't really see any enhanced security beyond what you may get on your smartphone, and a TAILS USB with an Electrum wallet would be a vastly superior option and it's free less the cost of a thumbdrive. 
There's a few Amazon reviews that leave you scratching your head that the company hasn't deigned to respond to and the Google Play reviews for their very generically named "ourtoken" app--which is another risk because it would be easy to confuse it for a similarly named app that's been pumped to the top of the app store--generally indicate problems with functionality with no response from the devs. If a hardware wallet manufacturer lacks the resources to maintain their app and engage users in troubleshooting it raises serious doubts as to their ability to respond to critical security vulnerabilities. 
In general, the less complex the device the smaller the attack surface. Consider a Ledger Nano S, currently available at a discount but Ledger is announcing a new device in a few days so you may want to wait, or a Trezor T which is more expensive, both have wallet integration so you can use them with wallet apps outside of official channels. ColdCard is another decent option but it currently lacks the ecosystem that the two previous hardware wallets share if that's what's important to you. I only recently received a KeepKey so I can't offer a qualified opinion.

I think you've missed the point, which is that it is burdensome to download the blockchain as it currently stands given basic infrastructure. If we want to help those most disadvantaged by fiat currencies, who largely live in that vast swathe of the world outside of high-speed internet and for whom terabyte drives may be unattainable, and enable them to establish their own Bitcoin infrastructure so they are independent of third parties then a blockchain that is exorbitantly expensive in terms of bandwidth creates a disproportionate disadvantage for those most in need.

Good to know, I appreciate it. I may not be understanding properly, so correct me if I'm wrong, but the vulnerability is in the app querying a remote node and that node knowing what addresses are being monitored.

I'm not certain where this "sequester bitcoin from the market increases adoption" business has come from or what the intent could possibly be, but my most charitable interpretation is that some people who dont really understand bitcoin are unintentionally spreading a sort of bad idea of how BTC succeeds.  
Bitcoin is a person to person currency and its real benefits, intent, and value lie in its use as a medium of exchange. This is why understanding and education are foundational, and I generally have the opinion that you can talk to people about bitcoin without holding a protest sign against your favorite bugaboo. As more people and businesses use it the demand isn't limited to a tiny pool of "investors" who drive speculative bubbles but vastly increases the market for the currency to all people who, well...use currency.
We do eventually need to reach a steady-state or at least less drastic price swings for average folks to safely hold BTC as their main/sole currency. We'll get there eventually. In this market I've been buying my spending BTC shortly before purchasing and then sending it. Admittedly not ideal but I'm going to buy stuff anyway, why not support something I believe in by contributing to real life use cases?

Osuntokun &amp; Decker's contribution of Sphinx to LN protocol cant be overstated as privacy is "on" by default. Third party payment processors circumvent this, but...IDK, I get that realistically there's a gap between people who are willing to "be their own bank" and those who will walk away saying "this shit's complicated, how tf do I send money"?
I will always be of the opinion that the best cure for the latter is education, but I still haven't come up with a way to sit someone down who has zero interest in the tech but just wants to get and send bitcoin and get them engaged in what bitcoin is and how it works. It seems to me that custodial intermediaries are a necessary evil at this stage of the game and probably will be for some time, and if they spur adoption by getting a technophobe's foot in the door, then "this is good for Bitcoin™." 
Anyhow, I'm rambling again. Ultimately, the market will decide, and if you value maximum privacy and complete control over your exchangeable value in exchange for a modicum of learning and tinkering you'll likely pick something like Samourai. If you just want it to work with (almost) zero effort, BlueWallet's a good choice.

CryptoKirby is probably a close second but is really good at marketing himself, uses some NLP, and convinces men that he's not losing money and can teach them to be just like him for the low, low price of 0.5 BTC per month. SunnyDecree isnt bad, but his...enthusiasm is sometimes too much for me.
I kind of like Carl from The Moon, his is the only channel that has the bell clicked; he seems to be right more often than not but when he's wrong it's because he loves BTC and wants to see it go to the moon. He's probably the only YTer I've heard say, "I was wrong." Relatively balanced and entertaining.
That said, I still think TA is some form of voodoo magic. ��

A short is someone betting that the price will go down and shorts have been steadily increasing since November. Essentially you ~~buy~~ borrow say 100 BTC at 4k with the promise to repay that 100 BTC at a later date. You sell that 100 BTC for 40k fiat and then if/when the price goes to 2k you buy back 100 BTC and close out your short. You make 20k on the bet. However, if there is a price increase above 4k that is sustained most of these short sellers then have to buy the 100 BTC and return it at a loss. The buying pressure increases due to this so called "short squeeze" which drives the price higher and forces more short sellers to buy and close their positions.

Right now exchanges are a necessary evil but in time it won't be a matter of being required to exchange fiat for bitcoin but rather directly receiving bitcoin for goods &amp; services.
What's ignorant is that the reason bitcoin works is because it's trustless and decentralized, which needs to/will be fostered in how it's exchanged, but instead you're saying the fundamental characteristics of an unique currency are childish, etc. etc.
You can certainly be contrarian and care only about the price and treat it solely as a means to get rich quick, but you speak only for yourself.

Just finished watching. All attack vectors require physical access to the devices. Bad news for TREZOR. Without a passphrase setup, which hypothetically can mitigate the attack, it is trivial to extract the seed &amp; pin.
Ledger fared better but on the Blue you can pick up the PIN with an antenna from across the room. Nano can have an antenna installed in the case that permits RF signing of transactions, but the attack would need to be combined with compromised software to initiate a false transaction/alter the receive address. On Linux the Ledger Live app doesn't recognize the device as genuine with the added antenna but on Windows it does. Le sigh.
TL;DR: Add a passphrase to your TREZOR right away and never let it out of your possession. Consider using an easy Linux distro like Ubuntu to access your Ledger, at least initially to confirm it is genuine.

I'm going to sound like a bitch here, but this is negligence plain &amp; simple.
1) 170.000$ in a hot wallet. You may as well have put 170.000 of currency in your billfold and went on holiday with it.  
2) SCREENSHOT OF THE SEED. *Counting on it to be backed up to the cloud.* Da fuq? You never screenshot it, you never take a picture of it, you never put it in a computer in any form other than to recover your wallet, and **you most certainly do not upload it to the cloud.** Your should consider your seed your crypto, if anything happens to any device it allows you to import all your keys into another wallet; anyone else can do the same.     
3) Cold storage/hardware wallet malfunctions, can't be bothered to spend 50$ and wait for a replacement to arrive and restore from the seed. Doesn't sweep the keys to a watching only wallet, not that it would have made much difference when one grossly mismanages access codes to private keys (    
4) You buy a new computer and dump all your keys on it. This is almost exactly the same as buying a new car, locking 170.000 of diamonds in the boot, making a nearly infinite number of key copies ( then returning the car to the dealer and being surprised when they've vacuumed up your diamonds and discarded them without realizing what they were.
It's hard to believe that this is real life because you've done practically everything wrong at every step. In fact, there's so much information out there and it's so difficult to do so much wrong that you had to be willfully ignorant at every step. Now we have that established...
Go to  and get yourself a nice sturdy (**X**) USB drive, I like the Samsung Bar. Follow the instructions--you can afford fancy clothes and iMacs and new offices and cars and 170.000$ of crypto so unless you're a Kardashian you probably didn't get where you are by luck and so are most certainly not mentally deficient, just careless, &amp; this isn't rocket surgery--and make a live install. Boot into the USB, enable persistent storage and make your password a sentence you can easily remember like "December 2018: Never Forget!", using the pre-installed apps make yourself an electrum watching only wallet, you write down your (**Y**) seed with pen and paper, double check it, write it out a second time and double check that. Proceed to sweep any keys you have floating around out there.
**X** &amp; **Y** (all copies) then get stored in your safe. Up to you if you distribute a seed copy to a secure secondary location should something happen to the first. You now have an OS that is the most secure in the world and is entirely independent of any single computer. You don't carry your diamonds on your person, you don't put them in the boot of your new car, you keep those sparkly bitches in your safe.
A Ledger or TREZOR is simpler if you don't want to tinker with Linux, and top notch if you use an easy Linux distro like Ubuntu on a cheap laptop with a basic firewall enabled ($ sudo ufw default allow outgoing, $ sudo ufw default deny incoming, $ sudo ufw enable). Learn how to use it. Send &amp; receive money multiple times. Sabotage your operation, I mean put 5$ on it and then wipe the device. Delete the app from your computer. Oh noez! How do you get it back? Not difficult, you got this, read the documentation. Ask questions. Do it again. 
**These are basic skills any crypto user must learn**, akin to learning to balance a checkbook.

I think we need to rethink the common wisdom of using a hardware wallet as cold storage only. It's a super secure way to carry and use your bitcoin without ever exposing your private keys when combined with a wallet on your phone.

IDK anything about the conspiracy to discredit paper wallets, but how do you routinely spend from a paper wallet and replenish your bitcoin? Seems like a hardware wallet provides all the security benefits of a paper wallet with the added ability to transfer funds or recover funds when just a piece of paper is lost.
I know people outside of a culture of digital ownership, generally older people, like to hold something in their hand, as if it makes it more real. Thing is, the Bitcoin still exists "out there" on the block chain, all you're doing is sequestering the access codes on a piece of paper.

[OpenBazaar]( - A Decentralized Platform like Bisq that's a kitschy combination of Etsy, EBay, and DarkNetMarkets. (Probs wouldn't rec. buying drugs here). Great experience, just need more sellers. Not available for mobile.   
[Bisq]( - No KYC/ID required, BTC exchanged the way it's meant to be. A Decentralized Exchange where you can buy and sell crypto person to person, routes all network traffic through Tor, pretty good but buying crypto often comes at a small premium.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:26:55
Not claiming that was the bottom, and mostly dumb luck. Not patting myself on the back yet. I'm relatively risk-averse and I'm pretty firmly in the using BTC as a currency camp. In this market I hold fiat on exchanges and buy when I expect to spend BTC to minimize risk. I hold 2.1 BTC in a fund that I'll hold until the end of time because I believe in it enough to hodl one ten-millionth of the total BTC supply regardless of price. 
Anyhow, to answer your question, I'm just playing around speculating with 10k USD. I'd only have to sell a little over half a bitcoin and still have the same "skin in the game," as it were. Writing this has given me a little bit of clarity, tbh. When gambling you should put your winnings in your pocket and keep playing with the money you can afford to lose.

Institutional investors have more time on their side than I do and back in early November I anticipated a correction, followed by a rally with a second correction below previous lows. I also thought shitcoins would get slaughtered, and still think that will be the case, I have a few that I am fond of because they're not trying to do too much, not trying to be anything but sound money so I'm very bullish onbthem in the long term. Time will tell if all that is correct, I shouldn't try to fit shoehorn the data into my hypothesis but I'm testing it all the same without risking too much.
Any institutional investors seriously interested in long term gains have been strategically accumulating since before the slaughter in November. They have the benefit of volumes and time to ignore the volatility. OTC trading is troublesome because it has little effect on the market price. As far as government endorsed cryptocurrency goes I'm exceedingly skeptical they would approve anything as legal tender that they do not have absolute control over, Trump does not care about freedom so much as he cares about his inability to dictate what the Fed does with the money supply. Otherwise said, he is upset because he doesn't control the money. That does not mean he won't do everything in his power to undermine the Fed but making public declarations of US Goverment support of Bitcoin is improbable. The most probable optimistic outcome is that the people realize that manipulation of the money supply can make or break them and place their exchangeable value in more stable/predictable forms of currency. That doesn't sound like Bitcoin right now, but there is some promise that they may more aggressively diversify into crypto if it proves a resilient asset class.
We're only.discovering how crypto will perform in a recession so all of this is conjecture, but there's just so much uncertainty and a further correction testing the 3000 limit would feel like a proper bottom to me and increase confidence in resuming buying. Regardless, a lot of sleepy conjecture in a speculative jungle. If I had a crystal ball I'd be rich.

The Ledger software checks the integrity of the device automatically and will tell you the Ledger is genuine. Very little concern for an eBay purchase. Most involved bit is getting it setup initially and getting comfortable with sending and receiving.
Download Ledger Live, connect device and follow the on-screen prompts to configure as a new wallet. Then navigate to manager on the left hand bar, each currency needs an app to manage the keys so you'll need to install the bitcoin app. Next create a bitcoin account on the device (Add Account) and on give it a spiffy name. 
Go to coinbase, accounts, bitcoin, send. In the Ledger app the upper right hand corner has Send and Receive. Click receive and it will generate a receive address, a disposable address that directs funds to your wallet. Follow the on-screen instructions and copy the receive address from Ledger Live.
From Coinbase select send, enter amount (recommend a small test amount to make sure you have this down) and paste the address you just copied into the corresponding field.
Check my post history, I recently posted a process for familiarizing yourself with a Ledger, although it may not have been as relevant or helpful as I imagined it would have been. I know it seems overwhelming and super technical when reading this but once you he made an account and you've done it a couple times the process can be broken down to: generate address, send bitcoin from exchange to that address.
If you have questions or this is unclear feel free to ask &amp; I'll respond as I'm able. You may also want to check out and the device website

Everything that was covered requires someone to have physical possession of your device and to tamper with it internally. I wouldn't worry overmuch, particularly in the case of the Ledger.

Exciting to watch what will happen. Feels like we may have already tested higher after yesterday's lows and have been rejected.

I could care less what you do with your exchangeable value. Buy drugs, some bullshit designer handbag, spend it at online casinos, hire entertainment for the evening or buy your groceries.The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is it doesn't give a shit what you're spending it  on, and neither do I.

I'm so ambivalent right now. Decided the risk was worth it at 3200$, then 3500$. Sell &amp; take profits or hodl the full amount &amp; hope it goes even higher for better gains? The latter feels a little greedy but the charts arent what I would expect for dead cat bounce. There's an increase then a period of consolidation, then an increase followed by further consolidation. Shorts have steadily increased since November to ATHs and as meme-y as a short squeeze has become if we're able to sustain 4200+ it's probably going to be bad for the shorters but good for the price, at least in the near term.

You'll never have crypto in your house. All Bitcoin lives on the blockchain, what you're keeping in your hardware wallet is the access codes to use that crypto, your private keys. 
You could just delete your wallet, chisel your seed in a rock and bury it somewhere for maximum security, but you wont be able to interact with your crypto. Alternately you could keep it on a software wallet with the keys encrypted on your computer, but that comes with the risk of being hacked, see the stickied electrum attack.
A hardware wallet is a nice middle ground between those two extremes. You sequester your access codes on a device that doesn't permit the codes to ever be revealed while still allowing you to interact with your crypto. I use Mycelium and Monerujo on my phone with my "daily driver" hardware wallet for routine expenditures and have a second for savings/cold storage. It's a balance of security and usability.

@_date: 2018-12-28 10:29:18
For sure, if the customer databases were somehow compromised or someone were able to become a large third party seller on, say, Amazon or had access to Amazon sales records then I imagine the most efficient way to go about it would be to target an area with a relatively high density of TREZORs and target the owners. Use whatever means are most efficient to separate the owners from their devices and funnel them back to a tinkerer who would immediately disassemble, scrape the seed and pin, then empty the account. 
To answer your question, yes it can be accomplished but it would not be cheap. I suppose a thinktank would need to establish an industry standard somewhat like FIPS 140-2. What is pretty common in even the weakest cryptographic devices is they are "potted" or encased in a material, usually epoxy, to prevent tampering. Attempting to access the internals by dissolving, melting, or chiseling it off is difficult and usually destroys the device. Verification of the internal components followed by potting in epoxy would prevent the kind of access required to carry out these attacks. 
I would have some concern that development kits wouldnt be readily available to test for vulnerabilities and if they were discovered a condition of providing the development kit to the tester would be only to reveal the vulnerabilities discovered to the manufacturer. It would almost certainly stifle innovation of a more elegant solution that may not require potting at all. Ethically, wallet manufacturers have a duty to provide whitehats with their device to try to break into it and should publicly disclose known vulnerabilities. It has not been tested in the courts yet because a known vulnerability that a company failed to disclose or remedy has not resulted in a loss of crypto, but one would imagine they have a duty as they represent themselves as providing secure products and could be found liable.
That turned into a bit of a ramble, sorry about that. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:26:56
Which really has me perplexed as to why the innards aren't certified genuine at HQ and then undergo epoxy potting in-house. Is there some contraindication for the device? It's not trustless, but it's certainly better than having to trust every person in the supply chain and makes it tamper resistant.

FDIC only covers deposits in USD. 
If Coinbase becomes insolvent, gets hacked (MtGox, never forget), executes an exit scam, suffers a hardware failure due to accident or natural disaster, or you somehow trigger automated holds that have in some cases locked people out of their accounts for upwards of a year while support can do nothing (can you imagine in this market?) then FDIC won't be of any help.
It's like keeping your precious metals in a safety deposit box. If the bank gets robbed, say farewell to your gold forever. US hasn't seen much of it in recent history but elsewhere in the world we've seen [banks confiscate deposits]( of dodgy source and a little sensationalist but it makes a terrifying case--most notably the bail-in that was approved by the EU and occurred in [Cyprus]( when banks became insolvent.
It's also becoming increasingly likely that the state will have the power to seize assets kept on exchanges if, for example, you don't pay your tax bill. Not your keys, not your crypto.

ToS allow exchanges to freeze your account at any time for any reason. Fiat is relatively safe on FDIC backed exchanges, but people have and will continue to be locked out of their accounts for upwards of a year because they trigger a suspicious activity algorithm or somesuch.
Conceivably with increased reporting by exchanges to governments it is quite possible the state could seize your assets for, say, an unpaid tax bill or sharing information that compromises "national security" à la Snowden. You can come up with a variety of examples when what is moral and what is legal are not always in concert. Illegality of women's health services, state-sponsored imprisonment/torture/murder of LGBT individuals, or confiscation of personal property to satisfy institutional debts as in Cyprus. Independence of our exchangeable value from these systems is desirable and exchanges cannot provide that and remain in business.

Wow, "now is the time to buy" and forecasting BTC at 40k Q1 2019 in October when BTC was 6k. No mention of a precipitous drop. The actions of institutions are compelling and bodes well for BTC. That's all that can be reliably said.
He gets dramatic and overstates the case when he says some guy invests 1% of his net worth...wowee, big roller's really going out on a limb there. That is literally the amount of money he could use as toilet tissue and not have any meaningful impact. Another institution worth like 50 billion spends 400 million. That's 0.8%.
