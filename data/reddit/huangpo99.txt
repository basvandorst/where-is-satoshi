Dark Market's success or failure does not depend on how many people use it. The capability to exchange goods privately and anonymously using bitcoins was always there. Dark Market just makes it easier to do.
All of these people worried about changing the name of Dark Market need to nut up, get off of Amir's back (cause he doesn't give a shit what you think; he's busy coding), fork the code, rename it and maintain it.

You are in luck! You **can** change the name and not worry about being sued!
Here is the code: 
Fork it, rename it, maintain it!

If changing the name to "Free Market" is all that is needed, that listener would not have engaged themselves with the project to begin with. The scenario you described about a serious philosophical or political discussion won't happen just because the mass media calls it "Free Market". Any organization philosophically or politically against the actual intent of the software (private and anonymous transactions) with enough resources will determine how it is perceived, regardless of the name.
This software does not depend on the acceptance or adoption by an uninformed public to be successful. It simply allows private and anonymous transaction of bitcoins with **no** compromises. It is intended for use by people who know what it does and know why they want to use it. Its success depends on if the technology works. And if it works, those that are threatened by it will do all the marketing needed.
Finally, I think you support the intent of the darkmarket and darkwallet technologies. If you feel strongly about re-naming it, the answer is simple: fork it, rename it, maintain it. The GPL gives you the freedom to do so.

Fork the GPL licensed code, release it under a new name and quit your whining. Don't blame UnSystem when you get laughed at for being PC.

You are missing the entire point. If the darkmarket technology is implemented correctly, it _can't_ be shutdown. Likewise, these technologies do not need public acceptance to exist.

Agreed, Amir can call it whatever he wants and he chose the name "darkmarket" because that describes it: a private and anonymous market that is decentralized and makes _no_ compromises with political correctness.
And you made a good point about the technology; it stands on its own merit, not marketing. If it works, people will use it. If banks/governments/3-letter agencies don't like it and repress its use, I think that will raise a hell of a lot more controversy than sugar-coating it with the name "freemarket".

Ignorance and fear are conditions that can be cured. You need to understand what the Dark Market software is: a P2P application to anonymously and privately exchange goods using strong encryption. There is no physical or even logical "Dark Market" that can be shutdown in a P2P network.
PGP couldn't be stopped. Bittorrent couldn't be stopped.
If the Dark Market software is buggy, or law enforcement has physical access to your computer, or an individual user of Dark Market does something stupid ("Hello World! My name is Joe and I buy/sell drugs!"), then yes, that *individual* will be "shut down" (sent to jail).
