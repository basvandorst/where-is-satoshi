You should not buy Ethereum classic
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:16:26
You need antminer S9
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:18:43
Because it mines a lot of Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:51:45
I have a phone
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:05:31
Thats because people are powering up their miners again as the price is rising. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:48:10
Right now fees are pretty low for bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:58:55
Actually last bitcoin will be mined between 2020 and 2022
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:57:02
Its not a blockchain if its centralized.
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:04:20
0.02 btc is about $145 not $20.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:02:00
But its both a speculative bubble as it is a real currency and its also an investment asset. Its not that you should choose one of the three. Bitcoin however is not a regular bubble like one that pops once and then you never hear from it but the bubble pops yearly like last december when it got to 20k before it popped. Overtime it does increase in value fhough even after multipe popped bubbles.

Do your own research brother we are not your slaves.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:48:22
Wasting time. Would get you maybe $1 per 24 hours of running your laptop. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:37:40
Wow you got a lot of those
@_date: 2019-03-22 08:28:55
I think he just stole your idea mate
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:47:00
Rarher have 12 year olds than 9 year olds..
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:15:57
Yea but you will lose money unless you have free electricity then you will make like 1 cent a day.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:55:20
A 51% attack doesnt nessecarily take down bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:12:08
Please get out BCH they are scammers pretending to be real bitcoin. I would go: 15% BTC, 10% ETH, 5% other altcoin in top 10, 10% mutual funds and 60% FIAT.
@_date: 2018-06-23 16:04:53
Ow i thought it was an online rat like one of the cyberattacks.
@_date: 2019-06-12 12:58:56
Shhhhhh dont tell em
@_date: 2019-02-13 08:48:31
Damn you're a generous man :)
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:56:59
@_date: 2019-04-01 05:09:12
Then you are really stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-15 13:49:39
Wow great decentralization when 9nly the largest companies in the world can afford a node...
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:18:47
He means people that are bearish and shorted bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:40:58
They are actually doing very well and still traveling around the world. The guy is a daytrader and got into bitcoin early. I think they are already millionaire.
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:11:18
Yea well i wish i had the money for it
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:53:31
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:18:36
Come to the netherlands! We have a city called Arnhem and its also know as 'Bitcoincity' as it accepts bitcoin/crypto in lots of stores.
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:44:46
Probably because no one cares.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:47:54
The phase of early adoption was years ago. During ath even the neighbour and the grandfather were talking about btc. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:52:00
Wow didnt know people could be this dumb. You do not deserve to own bitcoin mate
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:12:20
Why do you think this?
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:09:37
But i dont want bunnytoken.. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:18:15
They should change the name of the website 
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:26:16
Great for you im not interesyed in bunny token though sorry bye
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:00:44
Tell me how and i will say if i believe you
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:10:23
Dont put it all in btc though get some alts or atleast som eth
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:21:29
But bunnytoken is an ico right? So there is prob a minimum invest amount
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:37:16
No bull run coming as long as we are heading down in this bear market. Sit tight and dont check prices too often. We might go to 3-4k
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:28:27
He better not
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:46:03
There is a typo on the "crypto lookbook" page you should check it. Overall its a nice website with some interesting products :)
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:28:08
Your trying to hard so there is probably a catch to it like a the fees being more then what you get lol
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:14:53
I would get abput 3 to 5 different coins spread out like this: 50% btc, 25% eth, 25% alts. But ofcourse its up to you.
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:59:03
Sell at 20k!
@_date: 2019-09-12 08:56:34
No this graph is from 4/2/19 it was posted on 4chan
@_date: 2018-11-29 06:38:02
Could be but we will have to wait for a comment/statement from Binance themselves.
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:18:59
Not really unfortunately but it seems to be a plot diagram with some statistical formulas applied to create the graph. Maybe some other subreddit like can give us more information?..
@_date: 2019-09-12 10:57:03
well at the time this graph was made the Bitcoin price was at about 3.5k I think this graph gives a pretty nice estimation for the (future) price
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:45:04
Autists become flexing rich boys
@_date: 2019-09-12 07:07:14
@_date: 2019-09-08 16:51:21
All cool and stuff until your mom finds it and thinks it's some trash and just throws it away
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:33:05
Tell me your private key and I will keep them safe for you ;)
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:53:04
Do you still now the privatee key/password? And if you know the public key you could check on the blockchain to see if your 18btc are still somewhere
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:32:03
Probably but its fun to see how long it will stay "accurate".
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:45:58
Yea no fucking shit dude have you been living under a rock or something?
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:07:51
It wil get you about $1 a day so don't expect to much from it.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:23:47
About $120 per month
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:22:27
You could have better sold somewhere above 15k and bought back in at 6k you would have almost tripled your bitcoins in a bear market.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:04:29
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:58:12
No cuz you shouldnt invest money you cant lose
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:23:55
1. Take a look at e-gold. It was founded in 1996 and backed up by real gold ( Apparently it was used on the dark web. If not it was paypal or wiretransfer etc. 
2. Bitcoin does not really have stocks. You can trade bitcoin as if it is a stock though. Price of bitcoin (and other crypto's) fluctuate a lot more than 'regular' stocks on the stockmarket though. Bitcoin can also be shorted wich means you basically gamble that the price is going down. (Do some more research yourself)
3. Most important events are: satoshi nakamoto releasing white paper of bitcoin somewhere in late 2009 i believe. Bitcoin getting adopted on the darkweb, bitcoin cash fork, bitcoin lightning network starting. (Just do some searching and you will probably find a lot more events)
4. Anyone can see transaction made wirh bitcoin on the blockchain. You will kust need the public bitcoin adress of someone. Public adresses however do not show the name of the person it belongs to so it is anonymous in some way. Just fill in public adress at  
5. How long it takes to make a transaction and whats the fee? I would say try it out for yourself ;)
6. Not my point of expertise but I know there is a new block of bitcoin created every 10 minutes and once a block is mined, all the miners that helped mine this block get a reward. The reward that is given for mining a block goes down every few years and mining difficulty goes up overtime as mining rigs get more advanced and more people start doing it. You can check difficulty chart here: 
 
7.  scroll down to the graph.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:02:01
June 2017 for hodling but i sold it in november/december
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:27:29
Invest 250 total or if you really want to put in 2k then buy 500 worth every week for the next 4 weeks.
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:03:23

@_date: 2018-04-13 13:58:04

@_date: 2019-05-11 20:45:29
