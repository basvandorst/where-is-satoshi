There is a good chance Robin Hood is going under very fast. They have no idea what they are doing and there are autists who are taking advantage of it.

how about now tho? It is back up. 
@_date: 2019-12-20 10:06:54
That theory applys to all, no longer produced items such as collectables. Bitcoin might lose all value becauae no one sees the value in having it. It is digital anyway and easily discarded and forgotten. Don't give it too much credit cause its hot right now.

Don't be scared. Be smart.

Everyone at the start of 2018 wished bitcoin was cheap and they got in earlier. Now its hitting those levels and people are scared instead of excited. It's an interesting world.

Still not a dumb move. If you like that logic then prepare to hold for 3 years. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:12:58
If one crash is worth noting its the only that took 2 years to recover. I feel this will be one of those times now. It i will recover but its the time frame you have to wait.

Most people are new to crypto and only been in the market for less then 6 months. If you got into crypto when bitcoin was $900 then gratz to you. I was not so lucky so I have to play a different game and use risk management. I won at the end of the day and If I held I would be back to square 1. HOLD will most likely win long term but I don't feel like holding a loss for a long period of time when I can cash out now and enjoy life with that money then hop back in when things are looking green again. The crypto community are brain washed to hold but that doesn't mean its the right move. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:16:19
I am not an investor, I am a gambler. My time frame is less then a few days. I pulled out of the market with over 6 times my initial stake  and don't plan to HODL at a loss like most of you. I don't get brain washed as easily sorry. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:47:14
couple of months ago and only 8%? am I missing something here?
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:48:20
This is not a good sign by any means. It has to correct itself then it will ultimately make the choice to go back down again. The news popping up seems to calculated to suck more money out of suckers. Time will tell I guess.
