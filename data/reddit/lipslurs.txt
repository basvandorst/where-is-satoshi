I'm just bitter I could never figure out what to do after I downloaded a wallet.

Thank you for answering.  
You have clarified that it's as secure as the network I use and the devices I use. In my specific case do not think my stuff is super secure, what with networked printers and such.  What if I try to print my QR code and it turns out to go to the wrong printer on some other floor at my job?  Can whoever gets that printout take my tendiez?     
I'm not super confident in the security of my devices, and would be crestfallen if my wealth was tied to a specific device or a specific QR code that I perhaps had a stroke and couldn't access.  Holy smokes what a bad roll of the dice something like that could be.  
Please forgive me if I misunderstand.  It's my nature to see the worst.  But I recognize that I benefit from others who see the best, so I try.

"Consensus" is a weird word to use for "majority rules."

How does one do that over Reddit?  I remember I used to see some kind of "verified!" bot that would say person a had indeed sent btc to person b.  
But, you can't send bitcoin over Reddit, can you?  How does the bot know what you're doing off Reddit?  
What if the person you want to send the fraction to doesn't have a wallet?

Hmm.    I'm not challenging what you're saying except that a QR code could be photocopied or photographed.   Would ANYONE with the QR code have access to the munniez?  
Seems like a QR code would only "feel" safe once it's been redeemed.  
Or maybe I'm just at tinfoil hat wearing freak.  (Don't use tinfoil.  Use aluminum foil. Tin foil is a racket.)

When you say paper, what do you mean?  You mean a unique note? Printed?  Can it be subdivided?  Does it have something important printed on it? What happens if someone duplicates the paper??
