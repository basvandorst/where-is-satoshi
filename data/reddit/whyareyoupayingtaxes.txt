A piece of advice:
If you do find Bitcoin on this, especially that amount - do not come back on this account and say that there was any.  It will suck for everyone who was waiting for a huge exciting story, but it will suck much less given that you will be able to decide whether or not you want to declare that income on your taxes, and if so how much of it.  If you do feel you can't get through 950 BTC without it being noticed, there could have very easily been "9.50" BTC on that, or "95.0" - enough to appear like you're "doing your duty as an american" and paying taxes, but keeping Uncle Sam from the bulk of what he thinks he's entitled to out of your windfall.
Everyone who has posted a story about how they forgot they had a shitload of bitcoin from way back when and stumbled onto it, associating their real world identity with the story, is an absolute fool.  Even then, you won't want to tell ANYONE if you did indeed find enough bitcoin to make you a millionaire.  Someone who's jealous of your newfound wealth could hope for their own payday in terms of turning you in for dodging the taxes and the reward that would be associated with them taking that money from you.
I do hope you found 950 BTC, OP - and I hope you get to keep every last bit of what it's worth.

That's millions of dollars that Uncle Sam does not need to be getting one cent out of.
I have a fairly significant history on Reddit on my main account, but I would give that up to dodge taxes on $3.6m too.
