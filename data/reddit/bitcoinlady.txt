Thank you for the post,its hard for people to believe in me simple because   am from a different background.if someone write and say am pioneering to rip off lenders on BTCjam ,it really does hurt. Why don't you believe in me as a human being as much as I believe in all of you to empower me. I believe so much in Bitcoin and its ability to empower my nation,the loan I took enabled me to register my company satoshicentre pty ltd,i now have a certificate of incorporate,a tax clearance certificate and a bank account for that business all made possible because of BTCjam, I want to build  this company and have it be the centre for all thing Bitcoin and BTCjam is giving me this platform and I wish people could give me the benefit of the doubt.
Give me a chance.

The story is not about me and fighting Ebola, was just running a story on Africa ,a story given to me for my blog from Mustapha Cole in Sierra Leone.The wallet given on the story does not belong to Bitcoin Botswana or bitcoinlady but to Sierra Leone's Musatapha's charity. According to what was given to me he is running a legally registered Non profit Organisation and you can follow the links on the story to read more.These are the details I have :MEDIA CONTACTS:
Mustapha Idris Yakuba Cole
43a Adonkia Road Goderich village,freeyown,sierra leone
I working towards a registered non profit organisations which will be complete by end of September,my idea is to bring bitcoin to African charities,it is possible that some people will come to me seeking help from me to help them fundraise for their Charities in Bitcoin and turn out to be scammers,i don't know,will work to find out their legitimacy in the future before sharing their fundraisers.
Another thing I have never asked for funds from anyone except for a SOS charity that is a registered Non profit organisation for a disadvantaged Children. If you can follow that donation page you will find that its not running on my blog but on ice3x and the names for the contact person for the charity is there and you can always contact SOS Botswana to prove the legitimacy of the Project. 
Thank you

am finishing a local non profit organisation registration
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:41:44
it is a good idea but before this is done,i believe we should do some educational tour,move from one village to another teaching people this new way to trade like a lot of us in Africa has started doing with Bitcoin. You educate people then they learn and accept

I definetly do not have the financial ability to run pool but wanted to get answers for one of the people I met today in my Bitcoin Botswana campaign.The guy who answered the question is an entrepreneur and has been following Bitcoins but has not invested in Bitcoins yet. He is fascinated by mining and the idea to run a mining pool
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:41:22
i registered
@_date: 2014-08-24 17:10:57
working towards registering the final process of registering a non profit and hope to help fellow African citizens where i can. It is not advisable to go to countries affected by Ebola,the best of to help wherever you are in whatever way you can.
