[Designing BSD Rootkits]( was included in a Humble Bundle [last year]( it's not that obscure :P

You don't get to choose the quantum state.  If you take your entangled particle and modify its spin to represent some data, it decoheres, it doesn't magically change the spin of its entangled partner.  What you can do is measure the spin (which will be random) and thus infer the state of the other particle.  Still weird, still [useful]( but it's not a way of making an ansible.
And that's the way we want it.  FTL communications [open the door to causality violation](  How do you ensure the integrity of the blockchain if attackers can *send messages back in time*?

Right, I see:


So you still need a classical information channel to communicate anything - you have to tell the remote end what to do with their entangled pairs before they can extract any information out of it.  No FTL, just an interesting way of securing communications.


What makes you think that?  The causality violation isn't a result of how the message is transmitted, but of how reference frames work in special relativity assuming an ability to send information outside your light cone.
In this case, though, you're right that it doesn't apply - what's teleported only becomes data once combined with classical information transmitted the old fashioned way.
