It’s backed by the military and the value people attach to it
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:05:22
USD is backed by something and that is the US military/political power. If a war were to break out the dollar would go down due to uncertainty.

Thanks for the trip

thats exactly what im asking. if 80% of all bitcoins have already been mined in just about 5 years it seems that within another 5 years the last 20% would be mined.
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:12:34
Thanks for the clarification,  but that leaves only ~30%. if it took only 5 years to mine 70% im guessing it will take 5 years to a max of 10 years to mine the rest. when the last bitcoin has been mined im just wondering if there will be a crash or maybe a majority of miners might agree to more bitcoin being produced?

I like this but Can you please put a legend because it's a little confusing.
Is the 51 percent technical ppl as well or just all ppl.
For confirmation time do more clocks mean longer time or faster time?
What do the hearts mean?

A lot of rich gulf Arabs go shopping with cash and they usually love shopping in France and the UK, I wonder if there is any exception for high end stores where one pair of shoes costs 10-20k.

Weird! I thought it was by high and sell low

They care about institutional investors
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:12:25
good info thank you

i actually love newegg nothing but good experiences with them. just to briefly elaborate my bad experience with tiger direct 1. i called and complained about an 80$ rebate i never recieved even though i had proof that it and all the required docs were sent. they assured me it would be taken care of, i recorded the dae time and name of the rep and got no where. 2. i bought a computer and after i bought the computer i was charged a higher price, they said thy would take care of that too and that only resulted in false promises. after that i took it upon myself to never do business with them again 
@_date: 2015-08-06 11:58:18
so what exactly happened to all those bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:13:43
this is a sub for bitcoin and what i get from than scrypt.cc is bitcoin. anyway i am more than happy to get advice on the correct sub?
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:03:47
great info thanks 
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:07:39
Thanks for letting me know
@_date: 2015-08-08 01:22:49
This happened to me only 2 yrs ago 
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:02:12
i was actually talking about mining and banking in bitcoin, i would like to invest in bitcoin but i worry that someone can destroy bitcoin value by doing something like this 
where the value of bitcoin can take an immediate nose dive 
@_date: 2015-08-08 01:25:15
How much money do they owe u, Sounds like u should complain to the BBB and maybe even file a suit against them ( if it's more than a hundred dollars in my opinion )
@_date: 2015-08-06 11:55:52
who is in charge of making the updates and what happens if lets say 40% make the change and the other 60% dont?
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:06:54
I thought the same, I was like why are people upvoting this, saw the art and was blown away
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:33:24
I’m guessing it’s being renovated
@_date: 2015-08-06 11:51:22
this give me a clearer understanding of bitcoin. thank you 
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:10:05
I had an extremely terrible experience with tiger direct but now that I know they accept bitcoin I might think about giving them another try. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:17:41
what is it? is it a book about bitcoin started? 
@_date: 2015-08-08 01:30:26
They are a terrible company

Thank you kind stranger!
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:24:42
Please someone with more time than me do a TLDR.

How do you know he is rich? I heard of him getting some donations during bitcoins peak in December, but haven’t seen anything else  to Indicate that he is rich. I’m not saying he isn’t just saying I haven’t seen anything showing that he is.

They forgot to ask themselves a simple question, why do customers use this service. Exchanging crypto without need to register with an exchange. Then they took away the the very thing that customers came to them for and were shocked they lost money! 
@_date: 2018-11-30 01:17:57
Just try it for a week and see what happens

It’s a meme. It’s a status symbol. Lamborghinis are Super fast super fun globally known. If you own one the public perception is that you are extremely successful. If you are a guy many women will give you a lot of attention.

What’s the best way to back up your seeds, Incase of fire? I thought about a safe but the problem is a safe might get too hot and melt or burn what’s inside so what’s the alternative for some one on a tight budget?

She won’t cause a bull run but every person that is added to the list of bitcoin owners helps increase the price. In addition celebrities may give bitcoin more legitimacy especially for those who are big fans of them.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:16:01
Basically it’s new and they want to make sure they don’t mess it up. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:05:51
Especially if you have over 100,000 dollars of crypto 
@_date: 2015-10-04 00:48:38
I would say put half in a coinbase wallet and the other half on a hard drive. This way u can have some Btc readily available and can use it to buy stuff or quickly sell it in case there is a sudden price hike
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:13:44
Coinbase 
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:00:45
Back in the day coinbase used to have a page that listed a ton of places that accepted crypto. Check out if they still have it
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:13:20
Great idea, I have a feeling there’s a lot missing from this list. How did you go about compiling this?
