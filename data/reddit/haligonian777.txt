Quadrigacx is the best when selling. They have a lot of buyers so you get better rates than elsewhere.

I like how he reinforced how smart he is numerous times then can't remember a password.

So if selling you get less...
It goes both ways

Lol wait, so you sent it to the wrong account number and are complaining? You know that it's you that needs to initiate a wire trace, not them.

I don't think they actively look over receipts to ensure you followed instructions properly. I think that's more of a fraud prevention thing.

Cavirtex sold shares on Havelock, which at the time of delisting were valued at more than $1 million. The company was subsequently sold, with investors getting nothing even though they held ownership in the company. Despite Kraken buying Cavirtex in full, the sellers did not have the right to sell it in its entirety. 
To compensate investors, Kraken either needs to buy out the original investors, or offer them shares in Kraken.

If you aren't in the US, QuadrigaCX is also good for converting Bitcoin to Paypal (in either CAD or USD).

Move out of the US.

Wait so they don't even accept it directly?

They have to deal with the challenges of banks reversing transactions. If you sound Russian and then Refuse to pick up the phone I can see how that would be a red flag. They are pretty much the only exchange in Canada since they know what they're doing.

They are legit, it's a long weekend in Canada. I would give them the benefit of the doubt.
