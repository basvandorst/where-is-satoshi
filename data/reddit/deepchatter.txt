Reminds me of Jordan Peterson debate vs. the zen people...

That's not the argument. An exchange will offer multiple investments to increase liquidity.

They have different business models. Coinbase is an exchange and Square is a payment system. That's like saying you'd be happy the NYSE only listed AAPL stock

Max Keiser is a loon. I actually cringe and think his behaviour makes crypto look less serious and more of a fad.

Yeah, he is a bright mind and that's great you are a fan of him... Mike Novogratz is a hedge fund manager who bought into Ether at a low entry fee and has invested more heavily into it ever since. You're wrong to say they don't need these people and you're wrong to say we shouldn't be hearing their opinions. You need information from all individuals.

Did you even listen to his commentary? It's important to hear opinions from hedge fund managers. They are the ones who decide what investments will be included in their portfolios. He manages &gt;4B AUM... If he has admitted that his stance on cryptocurrencies has become more  open as has been the case with other hedge fund managers, that's valuable news.
I think all mediums need to be shared. It's your and my responsibility to gather an opinion as to whether we agree or disagree.
