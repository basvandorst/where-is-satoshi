But the Japanese police left the fatman free.
The Cyprus police will get Danny. 
That is the difference.

You don't care if justice is done?

Whilst I sympathize with the threats made to Danny and his daughter, in case they have actually been made, we still expect 2 important clarifications:
1.Is it true that the threats were made 1 week AFTER he went on hide and run and cut all communications with his staff? How can this be explained?
2.Full and detailed financial report about the financial affairs of Neo Bee. Danny says he can account "for every bitcoin raised". However there are unanswered claims about coins missing. Some talk about 3,000, others about 5,000, others about 8,000 bitcoins. 
Until he clarifies the above, I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Thanks man.
Danny has a lot of explaining to do.
I congratulate the police of Cyprus for their excellent work in issuing arrest warrants so quickly.

Even though I supported Danny and gave him the benefit of the doubt, it is now obvious to me as well that the guy is fraudulent.
He ran away with shareholders' coins, left employees unpaid and all of them resigned, left millions in debts, destroyed many companies and families.
Brand worthless (NeoBee is actually a joke now in Cyprus - the ad campaign was "Who is Neo?" - now when you mention Neo people say "WHERE is Neo?" and they laugh), no software, no employees, deserted offices, huge debts, screwed up shareholders. 
I hope justice is done.

I am sure he will try to fix it by selling to a new investor who will cover the debts and give Neo Bee a chance.
After all, some of the Neo Bee projects were great ideas (OK, not the pegged accounts).

He said he is looking for a buyer.
"The whole process will be completed and handled through an agency that specializes in these matters, once the final details are completed, the agency details will be made available to interested parties who wish to purchase 100% of my equity in LMB Subsidiaries Ltd thus taking full control of all subsidiaries. I shall also be providing the new owner full rights over the Bitcoin debts currently owed by BitFunder/WeExchange as I know people are working on a solution to recovering those debts for everyone that has funds stuck there. This process will also write off all directors loans I have made to the company and I shall not receive any financial compensation through this sale process.
I am working towards having this entire process completed within a short period of time to enable the business to recover, to ensure that those invested do not lose out following this process".

I am devastated reading this. I feel sorry for you mates and for all of us who lost so much from Danny.
Will they catch him? Will he face justice?

He has a lot of explaining and accounting to do.
The police will get him by the balls. 
He said so many lies, he won't be able to sort them out himself. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:36:43
Not life in jail but will get many years.
Real shame and a pity what he did to us and his own life.
This could have been really big and successful.

**the Updated Prospectus does NOT include any historic financial statements for the first 6 months of operations, nor any financial information or projections. Actually it does not include any “accounting or finance items” whatsoever. In spite of the absence of any finance and accounting numbers, on the same day, Tuur Demeester tweets: “The Neo &amp; Bee prospectus is teaching us about the future of finance, so important reading!”.**
Amazing! This guy Tuur is an investor and an economist?
