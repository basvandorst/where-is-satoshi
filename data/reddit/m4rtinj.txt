That's a shame. But thanks.

Jump forward two weeks and you receive a phone bill for $250.

It was two different companies, but the company selling the product are the ones who charged me.
I don't actually care about a few mBTC. I'm wondering how would it work if I had to return a large item. Reading your link may answer that question!

The level of sarcasm here is insane.

I'm in Amsterdam right now. Where is this? I'll go buy some coffee, ice cream, ram, or whatever the fcuk they sell.

In my opinion it's understandable (but not very nice) that business are converting BTC to fiat.
They sell in fiat, pay their taxes in fiat, pay salaries in fiat etc etc.
They are interested in BTC as a means of selling their product quickly and easily for them and the consumer. If they held BTC they would have a headache declaring tax, and they would have a risk element which they cannot be bothered worrying about.
Put it this way, about a month ago I bought a product for £830 in BTC. That BTC is now worth £740. You cannot buy that product any cheaper so they would have effectively lost £90. Fair enough, it could have gone the other way, but can they really be bothered worrying about that?
They just want to sell products quickly and easily. They aren't doing it to support bitcoin, they're doing it to sell their product.

What's wrong with using a synonym?
BTW - you should start your sentences with a capital letter, and you only need a single space after a period.
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:40:20
In that case I'm surprised you even asked the original question.

Great. I'll cash in my bitcoin for USD and buy a cheeseburger for $430,000. Makes sense.

My gf wasn't as forgiving as me so I understand. The manufacturer replaced the faulty part with one of a better specification and said "don't worry about sending the old one back, you can keep it for spares"
So effectively they saved scans ass by keeping me happy. Also I couldn't find many reviews of people complaining about similar issues so I put it down to a one off.
I think the bitcoin element will keep me as a customer, otherwise I'd go elsewhere next time.

Whether he's a cunt or not is irrelevant. The prime minister is a cunt, but he's still the cunt prime minister.

I spent 2.2BTC with them a couple of months ago. I had a minor problem with the goods I received and their customer service wasn't very good. The manufacturer ended up replacing the item after I gave up chasing Scan.
Other than that issue I was happy with the purchase and will shop with them again.
@_date: 2014-07-23 11:59:41
I certainly will. I promote bitcoin at any chance I get and always ask "do you take bitcoin" even when it's obvious they don't.
@_date: 2014-09-21 20:52:26
Bitcoin, not money. That's a big difference.
Banks do it anyway.

Next time I see someone with huge front teeth and talking with a very strange lisp, I'll punch him in the face several times while demanding his password.

Follow a random URL to get cheap Bitcoins?
Seems legit.

I didn't say he was the prime minister.

Here's mine. This photo was taken at the peak last year, price was in GBP.

People seem to forget that many of these businesses have no interest in bitcoin other than recognising that it's easy to implement and offers another method of payment for customers (and possibly gaining custom they would not normally)
They have a business to run and want to sell their product. Whether bitcoin fails, goes to the moon or gets banned in China has no impact on them... Unless they hold of course in which case it will.

Less violent and safer. People would be buying from dealers trusted by a wholes community, e.g ratings and feedback.

I'm good at multi-tasking so I'll do both, and throw bitcoin into the equation to make it even better :-)

Other than trading BTC, my first real purchase was a bottle of Corona and a beer at Shoreditch cafe in London :-)

Even their description says bitcoin doesn't need banks. Why would the Bank of England embrace something that is completely against their objectives?
I don't know what this video is about. It's like one of those kids educational videos from the 1980's.

Did the postal service publish a report embracing email? Did they say how great email will be because no one will need the postal service anymore?

On the basis that you are even having this conversation. I feel an idiot for even participating.

Whenever I hear this my response is always the same....
Do you also think gold is too expensive to "buy one"?
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:56:49
Are you serious??
Do not open this file. Regardless of bitcoin, never open any attachment (or follow any link) unless you are fully expecting it. Even if you are expecting it be vary wary of opening attachments.
In fact, don't open attachments at all.

That's deep man. A work of art.

The first step is to admit you have a problem. Some of you guys appear to be in denial.
@_date: 2014-07-23 06:11:27
So what your saying is bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000, but by that time dollars will be worthless? Doesn't that even things out?

One in 4 UK drug users have accessed hidden online drugs? Their statistics are actually quit amusing.

Why does everyone assume I'm going to Amsterdam for the sex trade? It's also well known for its wonderful architecture art museums.
But a friend of mine is going for the sex trade so feel free to let me know of any specialising in oral. Thanks.

I stopped reading after they missed a closing bracket, because they were busy copy/pasting link bait.... 5 months ago.

Don't you mean bad news? It generally drops when good news is announced.
