That's a great product and I love that it's not custodial!
I see that only [amazon.com]( is allowed at the moment, do you know if there are restrictions for buying from European countries?
I'd like to give it a try but not sure if it would work

installed the chrome app from the link, created an account, clicked on verification email, logged in and no bonus received :)

I'm using a webclient for the email. Weird that this is causing an issue

Seems not working anymore. If you install it from the [link]( and create an account no bonus is received

Why the login? Would be awesome if I can bid without email and then share my identity only when the deal is completed (or not showing it at all)
