I'd assume stagnation or a drop in prices as people would be cashing out for fast cash for emergencies.

Isn't that sad?!

I'm starting to think they aren't lol

Promises of free money are lies. There is no such thing. People are using past performance to dictate the future and that's a good way to end up broke. All you can do is research and see how you feel. You have to go by your own judgement not others.

What an ignorant thing to say. Those people that bought helped drive the price up just as they drove it down. You should want them! The more people that are in and aware of it the closer btc can actually become to getting really utilized. I swear I think some people just want btc to be their personal cult that no one else is allowed in on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:58:30
While it is extremely annoying and I agree. The fact is, the more people in on btc the better. Instead of hodling the btc we will have to hodl both btc and the forums. Lol

Well if you're in America, you can tell them the USD isn't backed by anything and hasn't been for some time now. The only thing our money is backed by is the word of the government.

It's amazing how many people are on here that are sticking up for the bank. If you're defending the bank then btc isn't for you. Btc wasn't invented to protect the banks or care about their laws and regulations.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:49:06
True. I know my bank probably hates me because I only carry around a couple hundred in my bank at any given time. Screw the banks.

You can answer that yourself. Answer these two questions. 1. Do you need money now? 2. Can you afford to lose that money? If you need the money now, take it. If you can't afford to lose it, take it. If you have no use for that money and don't care if it might be gone forever then let it ride.

Hmm I will have to look into Gemini but yeah I do that with coinbase and gdax already. Thank you for the tip!

I won't beat a dead horse. Good job on having balls kid. Relax, btc isn't going anywhere. All I can say is hold tight and eventually you will see gains. Cryptos are here to stay. You already let fomo get you don't let fud get you too. As someone else said, sell some of it just so you have some money for yourself to live and and hodl the rest. You will be fine man.

Hardware wallet. Nano s ledger or trezor

It's going to the moon now! Hodl! You will be left here on earth if you don't get in now! PSA: I haven't a clue what I'm talking about. Neither does anyone else. Everything is speculation. My honest opinion? I think it is going to continue an upward trend from here but slower. I don't think futures will make an impact. I'm not going to get into as to why but there you go. I am in no way a genius so my advice is worthless. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:55:23
Haha that is great
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:47
I buy from coinbase then xfer to binance. Love binance
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:08:10
Because once again they are going off of past performance. The fact of the matter is, btc could end tmrw and everyone would lose. Will that happen? Most likely not. You have to remember though there are no guarantees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:04:05
March right the fuck in there. Put the paper on the desk. Tell them you want to withdraw all your money and close your account as you will be taking your money to their competitors.

Didn't they hit 1 trillion on the stock market a day or two ago? For a short time?

He plays for the Browns. He is a little popular because of Hard Knocks
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:05:07
They could ban it. Most of the popular places to get it are centralized. Completely decentralized puts off the masses who aren't tech literate.
I do hope you're right though. Fuck banks.

Lmfao these scammers are dumb. Coinbase doesn't charge an activation fee.
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:25:40
Here for the money. I love the idea behind it but feel it might be a bit of a pipedream. There is too much money involved with banking. There is no way in hell govts would let that die.
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:30:30
I'll do it for a dollar and some pocket lint.
