This can all be done on coinbase? How do you get a wallet?  Say I purchase $100 worth and it grows by let’s say 200% and I want to sell. How does one do that

More people need to realize this. Conversely you haven’t made any money until it’s in hand.

Legit talked to a guy about buying on December 12th when it was flying high. I was having serious FOMO. Then I calmed down and decided to wait till after the holidays, only because I still had some presents to buy not because I’m a fortune teller. Damn glad I didn’t drop that money two weeks ago

You guys I have no idea how to bitcoin but want to get into it. I know it’s like any other investment program and don’t put in more than you’re willing to lose but I need help. I’ve heard of bitcoin mining and something about a coin purse or something but it’s all Greek to me I need step by step type of help. Anyone willing to help a brotha out?

On mobile now so I'll check the sidebar when I get to a desktop. Do you have any reputable sites that I can go to for education as I'm sure there is a ton of misinformation out there.

Ok so I keep seeing these posts. I'm super interested in this but I'm not sure how to get started and whatnot, also it kinda seems like a parallel to the stock market where each coin is a 'share' if you will. Do they really cost 4K each? I want to invest but I have a kid on the way. I can't drop that kind of dough. Please help
