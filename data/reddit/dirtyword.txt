My point, which you seem to be ignoring is that, practically speaking, foreign trade is necessary in 2014.
**The other point, is that bitcoin, by definition MUST have an exchange rate because it exists in a trans-national context and (for all intents and purposes) any wealth that will be traded for bitcoins already exists and is held in another currency.**

No it's not. The Thai Baht would be completely worthless if you couldn't convert other currencies to it. Just as Bitcoin is worthless if you can't convert other currencies into it. ESPECIALLY because you're not buying the theoretical raw materials for the goods you're exchanging for Bitcoins with Bitcoins.

That may have been true a hundred years ago. We live in a global economy now.

That is completely untrue - anyone but America can practice free exchange of Cuban pesos. 
The concept I'm describing is synonymous with devaluation. This is the type of thing that makes a loaf of bread cost a trillion dollars.

Really, though. What do you honestly think would happen to the baht if it became impossible to exchange? Do you think it would retain its value? Any value?

I don't know why I'm letting the pendantry get to me. 
We are talking nominally about an online trans-national currency here, right?

Sure sounds like a Ponzi scheme when you say it that way.

It's kind of crazy how much of an echo chamber this place is. 
People aren't stupid for being skeptical of this insanely fast valuation. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:03:18
That's my point.

Annnd I'm unsubscribing. God, what a circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:19:28
Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with Bitcoin. It's just a regular old gambling problem.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:16:26
Scared of what? A tiny niche 'currency'?

Theft has already happened. Not applicable?

I wonder if you're aware of the actual definition of the word meme and not its bastardized internet definition. Of course you are, you must be.

Um, go for it?

Dropbox is not exactly secure. It has been hacked in the past.

I heard that the block chain had forked. Doesn't this undermine credibility? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:33:28
Logic fail.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:37:46
...Because it has no other application anywhere else.
