I used the Breadwallet function to withdraw BCH (settings &gt; advanced &gt; withdraw BCH) and sent them to my Kraken BCH address. But then my Breadwallet BTC disappeared, as if they were sent to the BCH address. Now I have a pending transaction with 0 confirmations

Bought 27BTC at 540. Got my 15K back at 1600, hodling the rest. Can't really say I'm investing, all my BTC are now a surplus. To the moon!

The actual price is the same of two months ago and we all were happy two months ago. I believe it won't get lower than 1200$, then up again.
