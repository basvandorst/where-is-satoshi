But I presume with 12 minimum words...the chances of ever getting 12 out of 2048 exactly in the right order is slim to none

I should escape and kill everyone? 
I'm kidding, that's not what they said

I guess that is a valid point.  I got to the word "kid" and had to press the word "kid" that came up as a suggestion to make it get accepted. If one of your words was "trees" there really is no other word that would get accepted.

great video, thanks! 
One thing I did within 12 min of watching this video. Made a 250MB truecrypt container, secured it. Then, used bitaddress.org to create 5 wallet addresses, and saved each one as a PDF to my truecrypt container. Then, PGP encrypted each PDF and deleted the  original PDF's, leaving only the asc files. I verified I can re-open them with my PGP pass. Then I can place a copy of my truecrypt container onto a USB.

Technically I used a Veracrypt container.  I still have both...I had forgotten the container on my USB was veracrypt originally, so I ended up blowing away the TC container and re-creating with Vera for my cold storage.

I had a mycelium wallet for a long time..but heard they were compromised by a chinese company who bought them...so I'm open to recommendations..since I haven't purchased a cold wallet device.

I need to look up a paper wallet. Never heard of it till now. Always heard of app wallets and cold wallets.

It had its purpose in the show to indicate how corrupt ray (and his wife) were
