They're legal to buy in the US, there's a cigar shop near me that sells several varieties of Djarum, I think around $7 a pack. They sadly don't accept Bitcoin though.

These are the ones I have, always considered them cigarettes due to the filters.

Glad to be back. I wanted to buy before the chain split to BCH but had some personal issues that prevented it. Oh well!

So glad I bought when I did a week ago

I'm a mostly broke college student, so $100 is a lot for me, but I feel like now is as good of a time as any to start

This is actually what I ended up doing! Thanks!

Why not give a few mBTC away to people as gifts like for birthdays and stuff, could be the best gift they get :)

Coibase is easy to use and set up, all it requires is an email address and a check to set up the account, took me about a half hour for the  whole thing.

I'm glad I'm an early adopter. I love the look on my friends faces now that the value of my BTC has increased by so much recently.
