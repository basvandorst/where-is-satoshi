Why the hate?  The core devs have been openly contemptuous of the desires of the community.  The majority of miners and bitcoin companies support bitcoin classic, yet even mentioning bitcoin classic is likely to get you censored from this forum.  
And no, the core devs aren't putting their money and resources anywhere.  They have accepted $21 million in venture capital funding via Blockstream and since then, their interests have diverged from the bitcoin community's.  Blockstream's purpose is to profit from the Lightning Network.  Obviously, the LN and bitcoin can succeed together, but at the margin, the worse bitcoin is for commercial transactions, the more profitable LN will be.  That's why many of us are suspicious of why the Core Devs are so adamantly refusing the demands of the superconsensus to increase block size in a timely manner.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:58:49
Really?  I never saw anything from him, but saw lots of anti-Mike stuff.  Maybe that's because I read this forum which is censored in favor of bitcoin core and censored against the consensus bitcoin classic?

Most of the bitcoin community thinks we need larger blocks to support the growing number of transactions.  A small number of people, "core devs" control the most common software used on full nodes and refuse to release a version with larger blocks.  This has created a war between the community and the core devs.  Some other software writers have tried to make the change the community wants, but people who adopt that software get DDOS'ed and censored.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:08:31
Lots of simple mistakes here.  
First, doing SegWit via soft fork hugely centralizes bitcoin.  It turns a large number of full nodes into SPVs by definition, since SegWit "lies" to nodes running older versions and tricks them into validating nodes unintentionally. SegWit by hard fork would be great.
Second, there is indeed general consensus, but it's for bitcoin classic.  The consensus for the core devs only emerges if you censor miners, companies, and non-core devs.
The lightning network doesn't exist, and *might* exist in 9 months at best (according to its own devs).  Add in standard delays and beta testing you're likely looking at 15+ months, an eternity in the FinTech space. 
Lots of bitcoin companies have publicly stated that 0-conf transaction are effectively **secure** now, because they are simply never defrauded.  It's similar to the county general store with an elderly clerk and no cameras.  Theoretically the place could be robbed blind, but in practice it simply isn't.  RBF is a solution in search of a problem (and one that introduces whole new problems).  
And yes we all better be in a hurry.  New technologies and new companies innovate or die.  The surest way to kill bitcoin is "patience."  
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:52:03
I don't think they censor anything.  Users can upvote/downvote whatever they like.
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:40:39
Definitely.  Current community consensus though is that the core devs version will immediately become litecoin, and the classic will be bitcoin (since it will be adopted by majority of nodes and miners and exchanges).
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:32:51
Apparently you can...the majority of transactions on the blockchain today are &lt;$5, and a fee of $0.01 gets confirmed eventually.  That's probably about to change though.  
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:53:44
You keep saying, "economic consensus."  What do you think that means?
The majority of bitcoin exchanges, big bitcoin companies, miners, full node operators, and users have all said they support an increase to 2 MB.  By economic consensus, bitcoin core is the altcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:47:09
None of this (nor the roadmap) answer the really fundamental question: With most of the bitcoin ecosystem clammering for bigger blocks now, and the mempool filling up, why are the Core Devs so adamant about not compromising at all while we wait for them to finish SegWit and LN?  Rather than even a small compromise, why create political infighting and risk a hard fork that they feel is incredibly risky?
Why would core devs (by their own admission) risk destroying bitcoin via hardfork, rather than simply compromise the roadmap slightly?  
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:51:44
"optimal path" for the core devs is higher fees and lower transaction volume to support blockstream profits via the lightning network.  It's optimal for blockstream, is it optimal for the rest of the bitcoin community?
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:18:12
"your groups" is miners, big bitcoin companies and users.  We'll change the record when devs either release a version with bigger blocks or at least let someone else do it without DDOSing and censoring them.
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:00:38
Oh, I get the confusion now.  You think SegWit has been released.  It hasn't...
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:53:02
I think they control bitcoin by DDOS'ing nodes that adopted XT, by censoring this forum, and by pursuing a scorched earth strategy against anyone who threatens the profitability of the lightning network.  
Consider the counterfactual.  The majority of miners, bitcoin companies, and users all said in polls a month ago that they supported an increase to 2 MB block size.  Yet Core won't release an update with it and won't let any node adopt anyone else's release; just recently core devs threaten to destroy the entire bitcoin mining community via a new PoW algorithm they would release if and only if people adopted Bitcoin Classic.  It was powerful blackmail to maintain power with core/blockstream.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:05:21
By definition the class fork wouldn't fail, since it only activates when it's already succeeded.  The failing side would die almost immediately since no miner wants to mine a worthless coin.
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:55:03
You're really not familiar with the problems?  Really?  Ok:
1. Chargebacks - many merchants lose 10%+ of revenue which is often 30%+ of profit margins to fraudulent chargebacks.  Banks lose another $5 billion+ a year to CC fraud.
2. Fees: credit cards charge 3%+ of fees, and a much larger percentage for small transactions, sometimes as high as an effective 8% fee, which again can be 25% of a company's profit margin.
3. Control: credit card companies can cancel your card or reduce your limits arbitrarily at any time.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:19:59
Peter's essay ignores one critical element: all current hard fork proposals include in their proposal the element that the fork will only activate *after* the majority of the community has already updated.
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:35:32
Yes, the technical point has been debunked many times.  Many people have written lengthy essays talking about the benefits of private blockchains over distributed databases, including top experts in the field who actually create the giant databases for big banks.  It's amazing to me that people like you keep parroting the same misinformation.  You guys are like the anti-vaccine people.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:46:21
**That's fine, but then you disagree completely with the core devs.**  The core devs say that reducing the number of full nodes that validate the entire blockchain is horrible for bitcoin and represents devastating centralization, and that's the primary reason they've been so reluctant to increase block size.
@_date: 2016-01-26 04:01:55
No one ever suggested having the general public vote in regards to bitcoin.  No one.  
The way bitcoin works (as coded by Satoshi) is that node operators update software, and miners choose which block to mine on top of.  That's it.  Node operators and miners are the "voters."  
When I say "the community" I'm not referring to average users.  I'm referring to people with skin in the game, people who are running bitcoin companies and bitcoin exchanges and have invested millions of dollars running large mining operations.  These people may not be quite as technically expert as the core devs, but they are a thousand times more expert at understanding the commercial side of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:03:41
"That's irrelevant. Just as neither LN nor SegWit exist, so it is with a block size greater than 1MB; you cannot hold non-existence against SegWit but then ignore non-existence with respect to a hard fork."  
Ahaha, thanks for the morning laugh buddy.  You honestly don't know that a 2MB fork *does* exist?  It's already been released as classic.  The community could adopt it *today.*  Whereas we *can't* adopt SegWit or LN because neither have been released by their devs for adoption.
It's hilarious to me how some people post on this forum over and over without even basic bitcoin knowledge.  Keep on posting away buddy.

You make a bunch of mistakes here.
Bitcoin mining is substantially less centralized today than it was 2 years ago or 4 years ago.
Bitcoin development is less centralized than it was 2 years ago or 4 years ago.
I agree that the internet is more centralized in some ways (in that big companies and governments are exerting more control), but take the broader picture and realize that *communication* has gradually become more decentralized over time.  We've gone from basically one big phone company that the FBI literally had a direct feed from, to numerous competing methods of internet access, including TOR.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:06:16
Why?  They don't lose anything.  They'll have the same number of bitcoins worth the same value.  The dead altcoins will be dead...uncomfirmable (since no miner wants to mine a worthless coin) and worthless (since no one wants to buy a dead coin).
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:49:45
Lol.  And the core devs pay attention to voting?
You don't understand how this works.  Devs release code, and the community decides what to adopt.  Period.  The devs themselves don't have to be democratic.  Clearly the core devs are not.  Bitcoin Core is openly contemptuous of the community's wishes.
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:34:33
It's sad that they would ignore emails to support.  You shouldn't have to whine on reddit to get a simple customer service response from a company.
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:02:23
But we've seen how that works doesn't it?  XT tried to fork the open source code and the nodes that adopted it were DDOS'ed, core devs said they would destroy the entire mining community by a change in PoW if people adopted XT (or Classic), and XT was censored on this forum and bitcoin.org.  I assume the same thing would happen if people crossed the core devs on LN.
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:31:59
Yes, it's a public list of contributors to the code.  They're not evil, they just have a specific vision for bitcoin that they're not willing to compromise, and they are well respected for their technical expertise.

What on earth are you talking about?  It costs less than $500 to run a full node.  Adam Back himself could take 5% of the investment financing that blockstream raised and *double* the full node count of bitcoin.  
As for "kicking that can", bitcoin is growing!  **Adapting to growth isn't kicking a can anymore than buying new servers for a growing business is.  It's simply part of scaling.**

This is BS (and a logical fallacy of a false binary).  No one is saying you need to please everyone.  There's been a clear and overwhelming consensus among miners, exchanges, big bitcoin companies, and users, for 2 MB for 3+ months now.  You are free to ignore the wishes of the community, but understand that then leaves us with no choice but to find and champion devs who will write the code we ask for.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:01:22
It's really simple:
Everyone will simply accept the dominant fork as bitcoin, and the other one will be worthless.  That's what all the big companies and all the big miners and all the big exchanges have said.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:59:57
This is incorrect.  SegWit by softfork is the worst of all solutions.  It's only possible as a soft fork by tricking non-updated nodes into thinking everything is fine and validating all new blocks.  Basically, SegWit "cheats" the validation system via trickery, effectively centralizing bitcoin and reducing the active full node count.
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:52:31
Lol.  bitcoin core is an altcoin.  See, now neither of us know what the word "altcoin" means.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:57:34
I think his point was that a lot of bitcoiners seem to be counting on the lightning network to fix existing problems.  That's kind of scary since the lightning network *definitely* won't exist in the next 9 months, and only *might* exist after that (according to its own developers).  We have no idea what delays might occur.  So we're putting off making critical changes to bitcoin's infrastructure on the back of a kind of blind hope in the *relatively* distant future.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:54:49
This is false.  SegWit soft fork is dramatically centralizing, since it effectively "lies" to non-updated full nodes and tricks them into validating all new blocks.
Whether larger blocks are centralizing is ambiguous at best.  I run a full node and everyone I know who runs one all say that 2 MB is trivially easy and will not effect us at all.  There are currently 5500 full nodes.  Maybe 500 will turn off, so we end up with 5000 full nodes, from that immediate effect.  But what happens next?
What will bring us to more decentralization, to 10,000 full nodes?  Broader adoption and more users to run full nodes, which requires larger blocks to facilitate transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:52:49
This is false.  They've thought about a blocksize increase for over a year, and had tremendous time to test and experiment.  A blocksize increase is among the simplest and safest solutions.  In comparison, SegWit soft fork is *much* more technically complicated and risky, and its centralizing to boot, since it effectively "lies" to non-updated full nodes and tricks them into validating all new blocks.  The only explanation I can come up with as to why they'd favor the risk and complex over safe and simple is because they desperately need higher fees to develop so Blockstream can profit from LN down the road.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:10:42
There's a huge gap between spam, microtransactions, and "small value transactions."  We'd be happy to eliminate/reduce spam.  Eventually bitcoin will have to give up on microtransactions (although I'd argue we shouldn't do that until an alternative like LN is in place).  But as you note **bitcoin is mostly being used for low value transactions.** That's it dominant use case.  That's what bitcoin is currently most used for by its users.  To destroy that use case for no good reason would be moronic.
Also, even for higher value transactions, $0.50 isn't irrelevant.  If I want to send $30 to a friend for buying me dinner the previous night, $0.50 is a substantial fee that will send me back to legacy methods like Venmo and Paypal.  
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:08:23
Lol.  You know we don't have any guarantee of what bitcoin will look like today right?  There are changes to the code happening with every core release.  The difference between an "update" a "soft fork" and a "hard fork" has nothing to do with the magnitude of the change, only with whether software updates are needed.
Why would anyone buy a token for a stagnant technology, a fintech that's static and unable to innovate or evolve?  I sure as hell wouldn't.
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:47:44
Why do you think competing views (many of them stupid, abusive, fearful etc) are a bad thing?  The whole idea of free speech is that a thousand voices compete and people can then pick between them.  
Vote abuse and brigading is totally different.  No one complains about that being fixed.  We complain about the censorship of ideas.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:48:48
You're confusing qualitative and quantitative differences.  A 30% reduction in fees from say $.05 to $.03 is mostly irrelevant.  A spike in fees from $.05 to $.50 is game changing.  
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:07:06
Jesus no.  The whole safety of a fork is that by forcing a choice, you get 95% of people onto one fork almost instantly.  That way you get one successful coin and one totally dead coin almost immediately.  Much safer and clearer that way.
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:01:51
I don't see it.  "the mob" is irrelevant.  The majority of miners, big bitcoin companies, and exchanges all want a hard fork upgrade.  These are all experts with vested economic interests in the long-term success of bitcoin.  Who's on the other side of the argument?  Blockstream, which has a vested economic interest in bitcoin becoming less usable for transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:31:38
Demand is always exactly equal to supply for any market that clears.  The mechanism that makes this true is price.  If demand exceeds supply at any particular moment, the price rises until demand falls and supply increases such that they are equal again.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:02:21
I'd certainly hope so.  The old ones will be worthless and non-confirming.  
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:14:31
Fees have never been $0.50.  If we're comparing to today, it'd be an increase from $0.05 to $0.30 which is a huge increase.  
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:04:12
Yes, but the idea for fees to go up substantially is *after the block reward falls more substantially.*
Bitcoin is still in its beta growth phase.  The time to raise fees is when block reward is far smaller and # of transactions is far higher.

"throw everything away"?  What on earth are you talking about?  
80% of the community (node maintainers, miners, exchanges, big companies, users) wanted 2 MB 3 months ago.  We begged the core devs to give it to us.  They contemptuously refused.  So now we have no choice but to reluctantly do it via alternative developers.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:55:04
This has been debunked over and over.  There are lots of alternatives to proof of work, and as we've seen with bitcoin that proof of work doesn't even work that well (relatively cheap to take it over, high centralized etc).  
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:47:38
Your argument runs directly counter to the core devs.  They say they don't want to increase block size to 2 MB because it might be dangerous and *they don't want a real world test that might be dangerous.*
Yet you want to test the transaction limit and mempool in ways that could be very dangerous.
@_date: 2016-01-26 04:09:38
I specifically gave an example in which the wallet's "automatic" fee increase would fail.  
And no, it's not ridiculous to discuss facts as they are today.  In the future, I hope LN will exist.  Today it does not exist.  I'd rather not hamstring bitcoin and destroy much of the value it offers today.  After LN exists, it might certainly be reasonable to shift bitcoin away from offering low fee transactions.

I think you're the one in the echo chamber.  80%+ of miners say they want 2 MB, every big bitcoin company and exchange says they want 2 MB, and the majority of users want 2 MB blocks. 
The idea that 2 MB would break stuff is nonsense.  Average block size has been continuously rising.  It went from 100k to 200k with no problem, from 200k to 400k with no problem, from 400k to 800k now with no problem.  Everyone that runs a full node that I know says they could handle 4MB no problem.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:14:52
We all want to adopt SegWit, but segwit doesn't exist yet.
Full node count fell because the # of people who could economically mine fell.  Nothing the core devs are advocating helps fix that.  
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:50:31
Chinese miners are being very open about this.  They've begged core devs to include a blocksize increase so there wouldn't be a hard fork, but core devs are contemptuous of their wishes.  So the vast majority of miners now they say they will support a hard fork if it gets either 70% or 90% network support (some say 70, some say 90).
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:14:06

@_date: 2016-01-27 14:25:21
Nah, you're misunderstanding a few things.
First, banks really don't care about bitcoin.  The private blockchains like ripple and r3 aren't competition for bitcoin, they serve a completely separate purpose.  Banks just want an easy settlement system for between themselves.  Bitcoin doesn't compete with banks on most of the things banks do.
Second, bitcoin core is the most centralized version of bitcoin.  The vast majority of the ecosystem, from miners to exchanges, to big bitcoin companies, to users, all want 2 MB.  Yet 2 dozen core devs have managed to keep the blocksize at 1 MB.  It's an impressively centralized oligarchy.  Let us welcome our core dev overlords and usher in a new age of bitcoin centralization.  
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:05:56
The mystery is why core devs would encourage what they think is a disastrous hard fork by refusing to compromise with the broader community even a little.  
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:13:05
No, everyone can upgrade as far in advance of the hard fork as they'd like.  That's explicitly how bitcoin classic works.  You can install the software a month in advance, but the fork only happens after super consensus is reached.
"not breaking anything" isn't necessarily a virtue.  I would much prefer that full node operators know their node is no longer accurately validating blocks rather than trick them into falsely validating everything as SegWit by softfork would.
@_date: 2016-01-26 05:26:52
First, the vast majority of full nodes can easily support 2 MB.  No one has said otherwise.  The core devs have said that *some* full nodes may not be able to, but haven't said how many (because they have no idea).  I run a full node and everyone I know that runs one would have no trouble with 4 MB.  1 MB is the equivalent of 4 webpages every 10 minutes.  Thinking that 2 MB is some sort of big challenge is a joke.
Second, you've invented a straw man of frequent hard forks.  No one is saying that.  I said that *some* innovations require a hard fork, and that we shouldn't shy away from necessary innovation by hard fork at this early stage.  The only two things I've seen recommended that require hard forks at this stage are block size and SegWit (which can be done by hard fork or steal hard fork in which we pretend it's a soft fork and trick non-updated full nodes into validating all new blocks). 
Bitcoin is not yet "sound money."  As we both noted, it's a technology in beta stage, still fragile, still nascent, still globally irrelevant.  Some of the core devs are acting like it's IBM - lots to lose, little to gain.  I *want* bitcoin to become sound money, but we've still got a long way to go.
Third, you went from simply not noticing my initial dynamic wallet failure example, to not understanding the commercial problems with RBF.  This is a common problem that many of the core devs seem to struggle with.  When your head is so in the technical specifications, it can be easy to misunderstand the real world applications.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:53:46
Big banks have frequent settlement problems.  It's not a "trust" issue in the moral sense, but in the operational sense.  The technical experts of the big banks are interested in private blockchains for this reason (among others.)
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:58:21
There's nothing tumultuous or contentious about a hard fork.  As soon as the fork happens, 90% of the bitcoin ecosystem has said they will simply get behind the dominant fork.  It will be quick and easy and painless and safe.  All of the proposals, like Classic, won't fork by definition until they have supermajority support.
The one and only way it could be problematic is if the core devs are on the losing side, and *they decide to create problems.*
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:43:43
This is cherry picking.  The whole community has been begging Adam Back to collaborate and give us 2 MB blocks.  He contemptuously refuses.  So now we have no choice but to reluctantly go with other devs.
@_date: 2016-01-25 23:46:49
RBF requires that users be computer programmers.  Forget about buying coffee.  If I buy a bed for $1000 from Overstock with bitcoin, the confirmation of that transaction depends on a ton of stuff, including whether the recipient has opted in for RBF.  If I get an email 6 hours later from Overstock saying my transaction has not confirmed, could I please resend with a manually changed fee, and I use, say Coinbase, I'll simply give up on bitcoin forever.  Visa/Paypal/Venmo don't impose those kinds of ridiculous hurdles on users.  It's funny how removed the core devs are from reality.  Something that's "easy" to a dev, is a game-ender for the typical user.
@_date: 2016-01-25 23:28:07
I don't think anyone doubts Adam's technical expertise.  It's worth thinking about economic incentives though.  Just as we assume that miners interests are not necesssarily identical to the interests of, say, Coinbase, what are Adam's incentives?
Adam runs blockstream, a for-profit company that's raised over $20m in external financing.  The profit model of blockstream (and Adam's livelihood) is based on profiting from the lightning network.  While LN and bitcoin are certainly generally aligned, there is a key distinction.  LN will best succeed if bitcoin thrives with a very high fee.  If bitcoin thrives with very low fees, LN might not do very well since it will be unnecessary.  
So I respect Adam's technical expertise, but since I won't get to profit off of LN, Adam and I have conflicting interests for the future of bitcoin.  Will you get to profit from LN?

Lol.  You really think the big exchanges and businesses wouldn't know what's going on?  What planet do you people live on?
When a fork happens, everyone adopts the dominant fork almost immediately and the weaker fork dies an almost immediate death.

Segwit doesn't exist.  We're hoping it will exist in 4 months.

We've been at it correctly as the average block size has increased towards the 1 MB limit.  Do yourself a favor and go to blockchain.info and look at average block size.  3 months ago we were talking about it as a *prospective* problem.  Now it's a problem.  Soon it will be a big problem.  Do you need to wait for a crisis to want to see an easy and simple solution?

"Bitcoin is experimental software; it's functioning in nowhere near its long-term form."  I agree completely!  That's why the aversion to innovation and updates by people like yourself is so maddening.  But we don't want those updates and innovations to get in the way of commercial growth and user adoption.  
"You've done no such thing."  Your reading comprehension is poor.  I gave the example where you submit a transaction and then shortly after congestion spikes.  This is a fairly common thing.  Even the best wallet software can't predict the future.  So say fees have been running at $.04, so my wallet sets a $.05 fee.  Then suddenly there's a spike in transaction activity that pushes the average block size up from 800k to the full 1mb, and so fees spike to $0.15.  Now I'm stuck in limbo, and I have to start fiddling with rbf (assuming the receiver has even opted-in.)

You're still misunderstanding.  I'm going to put this as simply as possible.  Source: professional investor, masters in economics from an ivy league school
It doesn't matter if a coin can or can't be sold to the market.  It matters if a coin is offered for sale.  This is because price is set by the marginal buyer and seller always.  The current price of $400 is determined by the number of coins being offered for sale right around $400 and the number of coins being bid right around $400.  If 10 million more coins suddenly existed and were offered for sale at $800, it would have no direct impact on the price whatsoever.  
The abstract "choice" doesn't matter.  What matters is the marginal bids/offers.  
You wrote: "If someone has a long position, they believe the price will go up. If enough people believe it, then that's what the price does. "  Not at all, in fact the opposite is true.  Imagine if *everyone* thought stocks were going to go up.  Would they?  No.  Because everyone would have already bought so there would be zero marginal buying power.  That means that as soon as one single person wanted to sell, the price of the market would collapse because there are no *new* buyers.  It's the *new* and *additional* buying power that matters, not the existing buying.
One more time - the truth is opposite many peoples' intuition.  When lots of people are long and holding an asset, that means the asset is likely to fall in price, because there are fewer *potential* buyers, since most people have *already* bought.  When almost no one holds an asset, that means there is a ton of *potential* buying pressure to push the price higher in the future.  This is why successful investors are fundamentally contrarian.  They do the opposite of everyone else.  When everyone else thinks the stock market will go up, they sell.  When everyone else thinks the stock market will continue falling, they buy.  They make money because when everyone is pessimistic, there is more *potential* buying.

Except for 2 problems: 1. Fast changing fees render transactions inconsistent.  For example, even if I'm using the very best possible wallet software (which most users don't) if congestion spikes right after I send a transaction, it gets stuck in limbo.  I'm then in the very awkward spot of not knowing if/when my transaction will ever get confirmed.  This is disastrous for bitcoin.  Who wants to use a fintech that fails to work for transactions and even worse, locks your money up ambiguously?
2. The mempool is treated inconsistently and many nodes (as currently set) simply crash when the mempool fills up.

This is wrong.  The consensus of an event is the consensus of the people there.  The people at the event agreed to raise to 2 MB.  Regardless, the vast majority of miners, bitcoin companies, and exchanges, have all said they want 2 MB.

SegWit by soft fork is disastrous and centralizing.  It would "trick" the non-upgraded nodes into validating all blocks they don't understand.  It would effectively turn a bunch of full nodes into SPVs.  SegWit by hard fork would be fine.

Everyone likes bitcoin core's vision.  We all want SegWit and LN.  The big issue is that neither SegWit nor LN *exist.*  The majority of the bitcoin ecosystem has been asking for an increase to 2MB blocks to avoid hamstringing the bitcoin transaction network *while we wait patiently for core devs to finish coding SegWit and LN.*  We just asked for a stop-gap measure since SegWit and LN weren't ready and won't be ready for a while, and blocks are near capacity.  We wanted the core devs to do this.  We had no desire to create a schism in the community.  That only occurred when the core devs contemptuously refused the wishes of the broader community (from miners to big bitcoin companies to exchanges to many early adopters and VCs).  That left for no choice but for things like bitcoin classic.
One of the main arguments by core devs against a 2 MB increase was that they feared innovation by hard fork.  They very explicitly said that the risk was too great.  That's what I was attacking.  Bitcoin is in beta.  It needs to innovate, and for technical reasons, that innovation often requires hard forks.  
You still seemed confused about this whole RBF discussion.  I am specifically discussing its commercial effects.  You've said nothing to argue against any of my points in that regard.

Sure, and the idea is that as the block reward falls, fees will rise.  But that's in the distant future.  Block reward today is still gigantic.

We want the cap to be substantially above what the network needs for transactions on an ongoing basis.  We can achieve this by occasionally forking, or by coding something dynamic.  Both have the same result.  It's not "kicking the can down the road" to recognize that bitcoin transactions will hopefully grow indefinitely and that developers release new code every month or two.  
I'd think the preferable choice would be  but  is a fine temporary solution if that's easier politically.  Remember that bitcoin is still in beta.  Many more code changes will be necessary along the way.  That's just the growth process of a new technology.

Does anyone think sybil attacks are relevant when the whole bitcoin network can't handle more than 4 webpages worth of data every 10 minutes?  We're on AOL dial-up currently.

There's no danger at all.  All of the proposed forks only happen *after* there's a superconsensus.
Literally the only source of danger are the core devs themselves.  *Everyone* else says they'll simply hop on the dominant fork.

Yes, but the way to think about it is as though the coins simply didn't exist.  I.e. there's no difference between someone holding 1 million coins passively, and those coins simply never having been mined at all.  
You could say, "if there were 40 million coins in existence, there'd be more supply which would put downward pressure on price, and since there aren't, I'm gonna say there's upward pressure on price."  But that's a weird way to put it.  Similarly, the inaction is simply neutral.  Yes, it is *more* supportive of a higher price than if those holders were selling, but that's a similarly weird way to put it.
