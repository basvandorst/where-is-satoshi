For me seem early

There are hundreds of coins better of Bitcoin itself. It's not a matter of quality only, but a matter of Timing, Trust and Consensus from the masses. Amazon, Google and Facebook are well known and trusted by my grandmother too :) so I believe simpler for the masses to adopt a Cryptocurrency of one of these companies.

When did you submit it?
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:16:00
This is not a Fork. It was a small group that copied the code and created a new coin. There is not split. No Fork.

250k seem to me a lot in 3 years from now..
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:05:58
It's not expensive when you think that in 3 years from now 1 bitcoin will be worth anything between 25k and 100k
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:13:49
Patience 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:48:54
Risk is always high.

Amazon is safe but I would buy directly from the producers. For sure if you buy from Amazon buy A new one only. eBay is not safe for Trezor.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:53:35
Yes what? :)
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:58:03
If you are here for the long shot, If you believe in the Bitcoin project and in the whole concept of Cryptocurrencies, if you believe that one day 1 Bitcoin will be worth 200k or more, well, then is always a good time to buy and hold bitcoins.

What do you mean by snowball?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:07:01
Ripple - long run but is in my top quality going to 10$ , as soon as hit 1$ will be a matter of 1/2 years to skyrocket 
IOTA - TOP 3 in 36 months 
OmiseGo give it 5 years and will become TOP 5 crypto
Ethereum 1000$ by middle 2018
Maybe NEO but not sure about that
Stratis will explode
Golem will explode 
Steem will triple value 
Pivx going to 10/15$ by 6/9 months from now
SiaCoin will explode 
Monero triple in 1 year from now. It's mature for explosion.
Bitcoin going to hit a 25k by 2021
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:15:15
Well Fiat currencies are not going up and down 20/30 or 50% in few hours or thousands % up in few months..
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:53:22
Why? :)
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:52:50
I wish :)
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:42:29
What else you bought? Or Bitcoin only?
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:35:26
It's normal buddy. Patience 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:05:12
Are you sure you wrote a Bitcoin one? And are you sure is correct?

This is not them but US regulators and rules. They would be the happiest to increase limits and onboard people as fast as they can. This is their business and the way for them to make money. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:18:49
What about Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:06:22
I managed to do it. My mistake was to write it in the electrum window instead of writing it down on notepad and copy/paste into electrum. Thank you
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:12:20
They are gone in the pockets of fraudulent people. This is where is gone.
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:50:32
Domains you have plenty. Taking off the owner and taking down the domain is a clear signal that the exchange is not going to open again and, sad to say, funds are gone forever.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:48:32
Not talking about btc-e in this case. It was an example. I say that as an exchange can steal money a paper wallet company can do the same.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:06:37
Interesting, can you tell me more or explain how it works what I need to do please? Not very familiar..
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:42:06
There is not a fork but a bunch of people that is trying to make money from the confusion/ panic. I call it manipulation. If you want the "new" coins together with Bitcoin, according to where you store it (hope not in an exchange and if yes read their policy about that) check how and what to do.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:51:12
Well.. what I say is that who Creates the paper Wallets can steal private keys before they are generated and show a "fake" environment where we download the keys but the keys are not new at all. So they can take over your money whenever they want and do it massively after few years. Technically possible?
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:43:27
Online Wallets are the end of your Cryptocurrencies experience.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:50:48
Only way and will not make it before they freeze accounts 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:55:05
I agree with you when you say "what people follow". What do you think about LiteCoin? And Iota?
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:01:59
The problem is that I am not sure about the anonymous factor anymore. The world is going in a direction where anonymous will die. You can think to be anonymous but in the end, we live in a world of laws. If want to comply with law need to declare the coins and pay taxes. So the anonymity disappear because, when from online you go offline, all this come to be tracked. If we want it or not, I am not sure governments will allow such a thing like being under the radar. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:14:14
Sorry to hear man, but every money processing company keep a reserve for 6 months.
It's very common in the industry.
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:07:40
Well paranoid fantasies are better than empty pockets like is now happening with BTC-e , if someone would post a paranoid message like mine 2 years ago, most would say that is not possible bla bla bla now see where all these millions are gone.
