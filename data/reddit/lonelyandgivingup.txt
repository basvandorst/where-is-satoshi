Alright, now my bitcoin is in a wallet. Now what? Coinbase to sell? But that requires identification... Is there a better option?

Ha ha!!! This guy right here is serving up some good jokes! Hot and fresh!

That's true, but I'm asking how to sell, not how to give away bitcoin.

So your first 4 steps were correct, but I didn't need to wait any amount of time for any kind of block syncing. Instead of importing my private key, I used the program called Electrum and 'swept' the funds from the private key into the Electrum wallet. This happened within 10 minutes, and the money was now able to be sent anywhere through Electrum. So I sent it to my Coinbase account.

Wait 2 years?
I'm assuming that is a slight joke.... But this really is an old wallet. Will it take literal weeks or months for an online wallet to verify or 'sync' it?

So any wallet software I download and put my private key into uses my computer's hardware to verify the history of the bitcoin address?
It was a brand new address, and no transactions happened with it. Shouldn't it be super fast?

Thank you for the help. Ultimately, I swept the coin using Electrum. But you mention doing it offline... I did it online. What would the importance of sweeping it offline be?

Okay, sweep first, then go through an exchange. But every exchange requires identification verification... I think it's called "Know your customer"? Is there any way around that?

Thank you EVERYONE for responding. With your help, I was able to understand what to do, and with an hour of googling and walking myself through the process, I was able to take 52 characters that I wrote down 2 years ago, and turn it into money. 
For anyone else wondering what I accomplished:
I used Electrum to 'sweep' my 52 character private key into an Electrum wallet that was generated when I installed it. This required a processing fee.
Then I sent the remaining bitcoins from Electrum to my Coinbase 'receiving bitcoin' address, which required another processing fee.
Then I waited for the transaction to be confirmed 6 times before Coinbase would accept it as a real thing. This took about an hour.
Then I sold everything in one go through Coinbase, (this required a Coinbase fee) and the money is going to my bank account that is connected to Coinbase.
All in all, I spent around $25 in fees, with $17 of that due to a 'Coinbase fee' for the privilege of selling the company my bitcoin.
On average, I bought at a value of 11.6k per bitcoin, and I sold at a value of 11.8k per bitcoin. But because of the small amount I actually owned, and the fees, I lost $21.45. Not too bad.

They were absolutely mine. Purchased them myself from Coinbase. Then used a never-connected-to-internet raspberry pi to generate a bitcoin address. Sent it from Coinbase to the address, and the rest is history. 
And thank you for the suggestion. You suggested Electrum, and that is what I ultimately went with. But I didn't ever go offline. Didn't the transaction have to be connected to the internet to even go through?
