OP was referring to the widespread practice of using one’s religious beliefs as the basis for the banning of gambling (which is a true occurrence in many jurisdictions and applicable to many other pointless laws - in TN, liquor stores last month were, for the first time, allowed to open on Sunday. This was a law that came directly from those who believed deeply in the holy significance of Sunday)
I’m not sure why that went over your head, unless of course you knew this and instead turned the conversation to bashing religion. This would also seem pointless as I don’t think anyone that is a Muslim or Christian is going to read your post on reddit and think “Oh my God, he’s right. My beliefs are bullshit!” 
There’s no need for demeaning other people for their beliefs, especially in a sub about crypto.

Completely agree. Basic Macroeconomics shows us that banks have a great place and are not going away.
Even if BTC becomes commonplace there will be banks that will hold btc

It’s just a threat to his regime.

He had nothing with crypto literally six months ago; the Bitcoin spiel is brand new.

He (Jamie Dimon, the guy who called Bitcoin "Fraud") was also the CEO of JP Morgan Chase at the time they were fined. Very ethical!

As the CEO of JP Morgan Chase he was one of the architects of the Financial Disaster of 2008. His opinion should be null and void.

Why is it bad for laws to be the same and reciprocity in these licenses between states? Am I missing something here? 
They also talk about a tier system where I'm pretty sure if you were small time trading you wouldn't have to register for anything.

Would this only apply to business in TN or sense I am located in TN could I accept payments online, to be paid by Tennesssee tax, which my business being located in TN? I.E. Would the location of the buyer matter if I didn't ask for it?

What exactly is bad about this proposal? I admit that I am skimming it; but I really can't find what is wrong with it; doesn't it say in there that it wishes to reduce reserve requirements and create a tier system that would basically stop people from being considered "money transmitters"?
Please, however, give me more information on this; I am very connected in my state's politics and could offer help with this issue; depending on what the fine print of the proposal states.
