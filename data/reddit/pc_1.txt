This chart is the stupidest thing I've seen in a bit. Thank you.

If anything is propaganda, it’s this video.

Common stock doesn’t do that. Preferred stock might have something to do with that, but the bulk of stocks just give you voting rights and maybe some liquidation if the company goes under if you’re lucky.

I think people forget to take into account the regulations that direct, high volume traders have to go through in the Nasdaq. Binance is kind of a free-for-all. 
Edit: For example wash trading generates large volumes for crypto exchanges as well as fees.

Wow, if you actually think you taught me something new just now then I encourage everyone reading this not to listen to you. And by the downvotes I see, I’m relieved no one is.

Haha holy shit, I don’t want to grow up if you are what I’d become. First of all, If you think a little 2% pump that happened to occur with you posting about it makes it legit, I’m worried. Second of all, do you know how to read the charts?  Many more coins were a better trade.

Litecoin? Serious Alt? What fucking Kool Aid are you drinking?

Nah, Tom Lee has been pretty strong on his $25,000 number.
