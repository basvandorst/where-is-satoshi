Me too. Waiting for 3k.

Sounds like OP was an unlikeable shit even before his bragging a month ago.
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:33:12
Let’s all use that shitty power grid to mine bitcoin!

Reddit replaced him with an H1B visa worker.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:42:30
I'll wait til after the holidays and get Bitcoin on clearance between 3K and 5K
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:58:00
To be fair if you commit your entire life money and sweat to Bitcoin, you're gonna have a bad time.
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:16:53
So still less than 10 percent capacity of Fiat transaction processing.

Whoever made that call at Kroger is gonna lose his job. I guarantee it.

Well said. A lot of comments here are a disservice to bitcoin. They are utterly delusional given the objective state of fiat payment processing compared to bitcoins, even adding LN and other emerging technologies. FSS someone had to use a post-apocalyptic scenario as the basis for their argument bitcoin is more robust.
Do you want bitcoin to go from speculative investment to practical everyday replacement of fiat? Don’t be a dick and suggest the underlying infrastructure is ready to replace current PROVEN fiat payment processors. It’s not. There’s a long way to go. Your philosophical arguments don’t mean anything.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:10:14
I think you mean staying in lambo for a few years.
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:57:58
I’m a believer in crypto currency but at this point, the speculative investment is a huge barrier to successful adoption. Until there’s a real prolonged crash I just don’t see a future in my lifetime when I’ll purchase everyday goods and services with it.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:42:37
But yeah you know more than The NY Times (all Fake news really, such a rag) and the DOJ
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:49:42
Considering that 20k ATH was literally scienticallu proven to be the result of price manipulation, ya might want to reconsider your position.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:03:04
Drugs on the darknet, amirite?
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:35:24
That and I fucked your Mum!
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:01:48
5 should read anger - proven price manipulation, not who shorted the market.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:55:20
Oops hes a HOdL now
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:56:09
Lol that’s exactly how one should fund a retirement account — highly speculative investment!
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:54:22
So you’re the shithead that won’t consider hiring anyone over 40 cause, “you know man, they’re old.”
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:54:04
This makes absolutely zero sense. What exactly are you trying to say? My 8 year olds crayola draws are more easily understood and informative.
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:16:29
Bravo, my good man. Bra-av-o.
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:53:39
Please correct me if I’m wrong but wouldn’t the current payment processing quickly collapse with literally a fraction of the transactions standard fiat payment processors process daily? But if ridiculing that makes you feel better, go for it.
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:00:15
The real story here is that pizza looks delicious!!
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:53:37
Im just pointing out Bitcoin isn’t this “crypto for the people” sentiment I hear often where regular people are freed from the powerful few who control fiat. Bitcoin’s wildly consolidated ownership makes regular people even more susceptible to abuse from a small cabal of the richest of the rich. At lease with regular fiat there’s a semblance of security aka Insured deposits in the US up to 100k, the Glass/Segal Act until it was gutted by corrupt politicians, etc.

One minute you’re up, the next you’re down
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:03:37
And especially don’t think about roughy 5% percent of of all addresses own more than 96 percent of all available bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:36:27
I just find it laughable bitcoin mining is being considered good for the environment. The energy is wasted in a virtual speculative idea that in most cases cannot be easily converted into something of benefit. Maybe it’s an ELI5 thing.
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:46:31
Wow! That’s impressive. Keep up the good work and don’t forget to give back to the communities that are enabling you to prosper.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:34:48
When I learned 5% of addresses own 96% of all mined bitcoin, it seems like it will simply substitute government fiat for some wealthy cabal. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:53:20
Ah ha somebody bought above 3k didn't they ...
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:20:48
Give it some time. 8k isn't the end
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:55:37
Yeah but Detroit dude. Not trying to throw shade honestly.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:12:22
I think you mean tulips.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:19:44
When he starts painting tulips it's time to sell.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:56:15
Considering MS products are routinely hijacked and demand ransom in bitcoin it makes sense. It's a customer feature request ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:59:57
So it's illegal to go against the echo chamber of bitcoin now? 
@_date: 2018-07-08 22:58:25
Hmmmm. If I connect the two, it seems we have proof of a bubble, boys. Time to go home.
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:31:02
I read the title as "just saying, the price is low enough you greater fools than I should buy in now before you're sorry."
@_date: 2015-04-14 06:47:15
Fox Force Five. Check.
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:49:09
Did magic mushrooms while cave exploring. Would not recommend, just like buying bitcoin at anything less than 3k.
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:12:18
No ETF for you! Seinfeld’s soup Nazi says.

Moral of the Bitcoin story: don't piss of a teen and take away his electronics.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:11:45
Beyond potential cross post material for these shitposts about bitcoin just keep reminding me to wait for the nonsense (and yes value) to autocorrect itself. There’s a room full of apparently clueless people motivated by herd greed mentality while some 20 something expert bloviates out of his ass using crappy bar charts. Uugh.
