This sounds like a way to get people to pay you a lot of bitcoin for no reason.

It was somewhere around 3 years ago that they deleted them. It was only if you hadn't logged in in several years.

The problem was that to log in I had to enter my birthday, because I hadn't logged in for so long... but I made the account when I was like 5, and thought that anything on the internet was out to get me, so I made up a fake birthday. Even with the name and password, they wouldn't let me log in, because I didn't know that fake birthday I made 15 years ago.
They had a big purge of all the old accounts a couple years ago, because no one was using them a decade later, and it was just wasting space on their servers.

Yeah, I understand what they were going for, but it took me awhile to figure out that it was a lower case b.

I've never even heard that word as a native speaker, so I think you're fine. lol

This makes it sound more like it's untrustworthy to me.

Neopets takes security so seriously, they refused to give me my password even though I knew most of the info to the account, right before they deleted all of the inactive ones. Lost forever. :'(

Only everyone.
Believe me, I wish no one cared, but when you have millions of people telling you you're evil and should disappear, then it's time to speak up. Sorry if it's annoying.

That's very unusual. There are plenty of places where being gay is still illegal. Some even have a death penalty for it.
Even in America, the majority are still against gay rights, though that is starting to change.

Agreed, he deserves extra credit for picking such an advanced subject.

Spent one dollar on bitcoin for the first time at 850. 5 seconds later, it was 823. Glad I decided to test it out slowly. lol
