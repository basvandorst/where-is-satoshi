Guess what is first thing come at my mind to do with new tech.  
Hi, we should gamble.  
Why? Because it is a first application that always comes out first.  
If Satoshi did know about, hi will probably hit "delete" button on whole project.

I do not remember seeing it in code when I first seen Satoshi client code.
You are right, sorry for that.
That just confirms what I said above about how humanity thinks now days.
"Why? Because it is a first application that always comes out first."

Yes, probably it is only solution in case I do not want to recode a node.
 I think blocknotify would be good enough.  
Thanks for the replay.

Of course, they should do what they want with their money.
It is not problem in them using their money as they want.
Problem is in dev side.
First thing what comes in usually is gambling app by default for any new this kind of tech.
Beside that bitcoin is exit and solution to avoid monopoly over the money.
With time, I realize most people are in cryptocurrency space because of gambling.
And that is so sad and confirms that most of peoples are born to be slaves and nothing more.

From my point of view it is simple.
You can not have lighting network on top of chain which supports few transactions per second.
By what I have seen, LN works with time locks. 
It would be hard to use timelocks if you have mem-pool overfull with transactions and waiting for transaction confirms for a few days.

Crimes are committed back then when in most colonial countries law is changed so it can suits "Off shore" pillage of peoples.All giants companies has there off shore companies to avoid paying of regular taxes.Because of that, poor peoples must pay higher extra tax when buying any product.So technically "offshore" product is not crime, but by crime that products has become legal to use.
Same is for the above."Laundering" is not the crime, but crime enabled it possible and legal.So, when any bank "Launder" money it is not a crime, it is just a funny comment which we all will forget very soon.But if poor people do, then it is.

Yes, I figured out later in the chat section that p2sh can be used with any script type if unlocking script does not contains forbidden op code.
Thanks for the replay. :)

Yes, I understand they trying to protect themselves.
But should they open their own btc exchange to ask for such info?  
I verified my account via phone number, driver license as asked by localbitcoins.
I would probably expect little bit more privacy from localbitcoins for what info I give them.  
Verified account or not on lbtcs, same as unverified. I just give my info to wrong person for nothing at the end.  
I working on btc exchange system specifically for paypal-btc transactions to protect both, seller and buyer.  
I hope the math will replace selfies and other social network trends.

Then they probably do not use their own wallet, so they do not know what I talking about.
Scroll is not absolute when ad/offer is visible, so unable to access Settings from interface.
Edit on post below.
Well, I did not said nothing bad about stellar.
I mention I have bean spammed from each side, even from one of the popular bitcoin wallet sites with ads about stellar.  
Also I made a post  to find out more about stellar from users to which they are offering to.  
So probability to get anything new about become high, right?

Yes, but that does not mean they should rape the interface for giving for free.
