Hi im new subscriber to reddit and a non blogger so please don't shoot me down if my grammar isn't up to scratch.
But maybe you could offer work for payment in your neighbourhood. Leaflet around your area and offer to wash cars for bitcoin or something.
You'll get more from this than a faucet i think.

Start a new account and try again.
A year old account with no trades will look dodgy to a trader.

Go to localbitcoins and choose cash deposit.
If you are located in the UK where cash deposits can't be reversed sellers  will not ask you for id.
If not in UK, choose a buying option that is safe for the seller eg feels like you are more likely to be ripped off, low chance of reversal.
Then pick a seller with that's recently active and has over 3000+ feedback. These guys ain't going anywhere with your money.

Localbitcoins dealt with correctly is amazing. If you can't buy from a seller post your own ad and they'll come to you. Offer must be fairly attractive and reasonable.

Is this thing still on?

If you trust your bitcoin with the bank, you might as well leave it with blockchain.info.

Because I'd like to get drunk too.
And that's always better if it's aided by the money of a kind stranger.
