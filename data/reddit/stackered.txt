yeah I'm pretty sure there are literally thousands of alt coins based on the same tech
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:42:41
Oh its gambling
the tech isn't necessarily linked just to Bitcoin.  crypto isn't going away but we are for sure gambling on which one will last
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:34:09
Lol wut.. simply wrong 
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:14:38
its actually probably the most accurate thing here.  I've followed BTC since it was &lt;$100 and have cashed out 3 times by being patient and buying at real lows, not just "dips".  anyone buying in right now is likely going to lose money.  there isn't a single stock out there you can look at for $9k/share that has no intrinsic value and only ahs future value, so I think of it that way rather than as gold/money or a commodity.   there is too much technology surrounding it and nobody actually uses BTC as money yet, so its all speculative still.  and the longer it is speculative, the worse.  prices going up during that time is due to investment not due to actual value.  It'll swing back down to 3k range and back up during the 2020 election.  the thing BTC is most tied to, value wise, is how crazy and insecure society is at the time, its actually little to do with any value it provides since it doesn't really provide any right now.
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:10:26
I don't think anyone here actually knows anything.  they just are hoping for easy money and everything else they say is justifying it
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:11:07
9. lose your money when people realize BTC can't really be used as money
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:06:56
maybe he's thinking space mining, which opens up possibilities of basically making gold value-less as a currency
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:09:21
Well, you can sell gold and get cash easily and transfer it.  Just like Bitcoin, but actually probably more easily.  Also, you aren't going to be scammed online for gold, in all likelihood, like she described here in this video with that closed restaurant booking people with BTC.  Bitcoin is secure in that there is the blockchain but its going to be super easy to scam people with it, as many people are already scammed constantly by different coins/wallets/services.
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:08:11
keep waiting man.  you have to realize at some point that there needs to be an actual breakthrough for this to happen otherwise it'll never go up.  its floating where it is because of the investment into it, not any inherent value
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:19:17
Riiiighhht lucky.  buying when its low and selling for profit is luck.  yes. of course.
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:34:45
yeah for price but im talking about technology and usage as currency.  the price will continue to fluctuate until a breakthrough happens, and that is when you should hodl.
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:25:03
15k isnt a top, 19k was the top.  i sold both times on the way down from the top
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:09:30
yeah I got out at 15k after buying at 3k.  got out the original time it jumped up from $100 - $1100 too.  people have to ride the wave and realize HODLing does nothing for them right now.  not until some type of actual breakthrough happens
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:14:39
I don't get posts like this
it means nothing to get paid in bitcoin vs. cash which you can just buy bitcoin with anyway
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:42:05
Oh keep hodling my man... just think about the benefits at 20k, 25k, 30k
she'll be extra, extra nice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:48:10
lol this quote couldn't be more stupid.  its probably more susceptible to politics/manipulation of the market than any other currency and clearly has major technology based flaws.  when exchanges can be so easily "hacked" or coins just disappear with everyone's money... I mean lets not even go down this road.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:17:30
yes, it will be less confusing to keep renaming things.  of course.
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:07:22
honestly, nobody deserves anything when it comes to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:37:48
so why not just spend that money on bitcoin vs limit yourself by being paid in btc?

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:42
Just makes me angrier that my purchase of 1 BTC during the last dip to 5700 didn't go through (credit card was locked due to fraudulent activity).  would've cashed out a 12k profit today for sure
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:00:48
Hate to break it to you boys, but you missed the train to make money on this stuff
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:21:55
Hahaha oh shit didn't realize you had the wealth of a hedge fund, my bad!
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:01:50
ohh man, I feel bad for this.  but your username does fit
as someone who made some money on BTC and got out... well I feel bad for people who still think they are going to make anything any time soon

I had a few at $100, was even going to mine when it was cost effective... was a broke college kid though... sold at $1100
might get back in
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:44:34
Knew I should've dumped life savings when it dropped to 420
unfortunately my life savings wouldnt have been anything
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:36:28
well, I wanted to start mining when it was like $10 a BTC I just was too broke to even buy a miner.  my buddy had 3 going at the time... then when it was $100 he had a shitload of them, it jumped to $1000 and he sold most of his and made bank.  I was there, and a believer in BTC throughout the process, but I just only made enough money to support myself through college so I didn't risk it
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:46:34
I wanted in back then when my friend was still profiting from mining
just was too broke of a college kid, then it shot up to $1000-1200 a few months later from $100
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:22:05
So much truth here.  This baby knows about as much as the average BTC owner about why its going up and down in value
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:47:12
when the winnings get to about 600 million+ its actually a bet worth taking.  I usually buy lotto just for the escape/dreams it gives me that night.  its like a sleep aid/motivation for a day thing.  only costs a dollar, I'm not buying scratch offs daily or dropping $20 on powerball
@_date: 2019-02-13 15:45:46
I don't get why you'd show that off... at this point if you are Bitcoin rich you were just a lucky early adapter, you didn't really do anything to be proud of

@_date: 2017-11-01 15:44:35
I used to have 5.0 BTC (bought at $100, was trying to actually mine back then but was a broke college kid)... sold at $1200 to fund life... sad now but what are ya gonna do.  Got back in at $3300
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:13:44
Same thing, told my parents (I was 12) to buy Google.  I knew it was going to be a growing company not only because it was the best search engine but because of Gmail... they were developing other apps, and it was the best email client around (still is, IMO).
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:19:36
I'm still salty someone stole my credit card so I couldn't buy in during the 5700 dip because of that
was literally going to buy 2 full coins at that price too.  shiiittt
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:30:24
I never have money when it dips
I had to get a new credit card (fraud alert) and I would've bought a full bitcoin when the dip happened... lost out on about 3k in profits because of some stupid scammer trying to use my card... fuark
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:56:20
wait... so how do you prevent this?  I was planning on selling my B2X...
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:25:58
not entirely... lots more were mined
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:34:07
I was too broke... I wanted to so badly I just didn't have the money :(

@_date: 2017-11-15 22:12:44
I just was out of cash.  I knew it'd jump back up but I just couldn't buy..
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:19:25
I'm always out of cash when it dips, every fucking time without fail.  Was going to buy, couldn't
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:19:08
funny and cute all at once!
it might tank tomorrow, who knows
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:26:00
sure, you could say the same thing in a year if it drops to $0 tho
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:15:15
I think, one day, we may be able to use Bitcoin for currency.  You're just assuming I don't think that because I don't think you can right now. Where is this Bitcoin haven?  
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:35:07
its actually too hard to sell large quantities for the average hodler so realistically this is what you have to look at even if you timed things well and sold at peak numbers
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:26:05
Oh holy one please teach me the way to time travel via blockchain (wowzers2the applications are endless!) so that I may win the lottery tonight 
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:19:12
1. I don't believe you
2. even if it is true, its not viable for 99% of BTC owners, right now
3. I don't believe you
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:19:14
yeah to blind hodlers
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:14:23
I actually tried to but my bank blocked it... super pissed
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:29:44
I just don't believe that you've only used Bitcoin since 2015 to live. My post has nothing to do with anything else like permission.. just pointing out that false claim / lie
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:28:59
what I'm always worried about is that a flood of cryptocurrencies will dilute bitcoin
what prevents that? adoption? the tech is the same, right?
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:20:17
I thought I bought some last night but I never got the coins... now it shoots up again
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:42:34
I used it to survive...
years later I also bet my last $400 on Nate Diaz to beat Conor McGregor... and won about $1600, bridging me from being a broke masters student into my first job post graduate
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:33:28
I was younger than 25 when I spent my last $500 on bitcoin... a month later it jumped to $1200 and I sold
silly bitch I was.. should've held till now :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:41:45
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:35:59
I was young (12) and smart.  Told my parents to buy Google.
They didn't listen.  They. didn't. listen.
Because I was 12
But I saw gmail come out and knew Google was going to be massive.
Then I bought bitcoin at $100
Sold it at $1200
Wish I had money when it was at $800... now that its broken 5k I'm a true believer that they sky is the limit
@_date: 2016-10-23 17:12:06
Damn, good job.  I usually just call in but either way, we gotta fight the man.  I don't let banks enforce rules on me if I don't agree with them, all it takes is making them realize its not worth the fee to keep dealing with you
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:04:21
Me too. I would call them and bitch until they removed the fee. Now I have a good job tho but it's truly fucked they charge a maintenance fee for people who don't deposit enough money and overdraft fees as well even for a few dollars. Fuck banks
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:14:46
This is literally the depth of knowledge that most of this sub has about Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-21 06:00:07
many industries are criminal.  law, politics, banking, oil, even medical research/pharmaceuticals down to our food production.  if the crime is big enough, we can't even see that it is a crime anymore, I suppose. we have a defeatist attitude toward fighting large entities of power/wealth
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:25:08
It could be considered a hedge against instability of the economy, it'll continue to shoot up and down during a presidency like Trump but I wouldn't expect to make money on it during someone more stable

@_date: 2019-05-14 14:23:24
aka he is smart as fuck
people here really trying to convince themselves they see something Warren Buffett doesn't just because he "doesn't understand crypto"... in reality, he knows enough that its not worth his money or effort since there are better investments out there
