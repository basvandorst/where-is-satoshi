Better to be right and get something than guess high and get nothing though surely.

It should be treated as a signal that the price is rising.

May I ask how much you lost in total and between now and yesterday?  Thanks

Interesting thread. What puzzles me is how you keep your money out of an exchange if you want to trade often and quickly. There are deposit/withdrawal fees too.

Is it 12% to buy and sell? What was the full process from when you arrived at the machine?

How do you stop people clicking/refreshing the ads on their own images to scam you?
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:09:49
Where can you bet on this?
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:40:00
You could lend it to people though...

You say moderate skill but only a tiny fraction of people on the planet have the necessary amount.

I don't think it will ever hit $200 again unless it gets replaced.
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:17:29
I don't understand what you mean.

Is there a non-USA site? A European one?
@_date: 2016-12-29 13:01:09

@_date: 2016-12-30 19:13:46
Easier to ask you (or so I thought)

How did you work that out?
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:51:58
The archive doesn't work for me but I found a cache.

I bet most of the people answering this survey thought "digital currency" meant online banking.

How do you know they bruteforced the VNC password if there are no logs? What was the VNC password? What VNC software was it?
