Also, kids are unfortunately dumb and easy to steal from -- so are old people. When I was a tweenager, I gave an online stranger my Steam login and password so he could "make me an admin on the server." \*poof\*
The anonymity of cryptocurrencies unfortunately make young, elderly, and people with disabilities even more susceptible to scams.
Electronic accounts and instant transfers are already available with services such as Venmo, without the risks of all your money being stolen or disappearing. The way to protect users would be to have a central authority and regulations, at which point you're back to RegularMoney™.

Pump and dump
Market manipulation

Why would you want thieves to receive your assets instead of your family? Sounds like you're just saying anything to support bitcoin.
I get that you're being nihilistic with "if you're dead, why does it matter?", but the fact that end-of-life scenarios (or even just loss of memory) with crypto are that it's either lost forever or stolen would be of real concern to most people.
There might be better solutions to come along for this issue, but "don't sweat it too much " isn't one of them.
