Quebec = dreamland for miners
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:43:10
then look for future announcement by Quebec in 2018 :)
also : 
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:10:55
Not really speculation, Bitmain Technologies want to go in Quebec, and they will by next year. Hydro-Quebec will give them promotional offers. Quebec welcome everything that is tech related. Quebec = knowledge-based economy and Hydro-Québec = master of electricity ;)
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:23:41
I like it ! Well done
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:06:04
Quebec isn't socialist. Mostly liberal (50%-60%) with a mix of socialist which is well balanced. Socialist never win election in Quebec, but they still have some power to reverse a decision if they really want to. They won't cry as long as it does not destructs the ecological environment. Since we have over supply of electricity, I doubt they will cry. Miners are more than welcome :) I am just afraid of centralization of miners in a jurisdiction. Quebec will have to block most of them and welcome only a few lucky ones
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:14:42
 for political reasons, read again (and also the cold weather, since it allows miners to push their computer equipment to the maximum, without fear of premature wear)

@_date: 2017-08-31 02:36:59
but to be honest with you, I am not a BCH hater. I think Roger Ver is really a wise man and I totally agree with him on some facts
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:50:06
You have to understand that I didn't want to hold gold in my own "house" or anything related to my "safe haven asset". I can hold bitcoin in multiple different address in "virtual mode" 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:18:47
@_date: 2017-08-31 05:08:14
Im not trying to make a point either, go for gold if you believe in it
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:59:31
holding both is a wise choice in 2017
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:10:38
we will see that in the near future my friend. I could have bought gold long time ago but I never did only because I never liked the physical properties of gold. Pain in the ass to hodl
@_date: 2017-08-31 03:22:35
Peter Schiff will soon merge into bitcoin, just a matter of time
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:30:49
Im all in since 2700$...not that bad. I remember back in 2013 : I didn't buy because I was not a bitcoin believer
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:54:43

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:21:16
Don't underestimate Roger Ver. He know exactly what he is doing and maybe time will prove him right. 
I respect him alot.
By the way, I like Bitcoin Core but I also like Bitcoin Cash. I hold both.
Edit : (Oh god, already downvoted lol)

Bitcoin doesn't need to be backed up, it is backed on how people believe in it. Speculation. It's different and it's virtual. You can't compare the virtual world and the real world. 2 different thing, the future of money is virtual

I do invest in bitcoin because it is virtual and I think its the future of safe haven asset because of deflation (really gold similar)
Can you name me something else than bitcoin as a virtual safe haven asset ? 
"decreasing-supply algorithm was chosen because it approximates the rate at which commodities like gold are mined"

Of course I'm getting rekt and liquidated, but just with the amount I'm willing to lose
