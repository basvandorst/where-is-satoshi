I’ll have to look into that. 
But I’m willing to bet we will have absolutely no idea about what’s quantum secure until it hits the world.

I mean if I was him... I do it with the account that has my name and has existed for 7+ years.

Sorry. You’re arguing technicalities at this point. That is exactly how the Internet works regardless of underlying technology. You’re vastly over simplifying things. Especially when it comes to verifying transactions through the blockchain through a global network. 
I’m done arguing

Or one is built on top of the other... so you can quickly see which one is more valuable. 
You have the Internet minus Bitcoin and you still have the Internet. 
You have Bitcoin minus the Internet and so you have... [fill in the blank].

Honestly, I don’t think there will be a viable cryptocurrency until after quantum computing is mastered. A working quantum computer would destroy today’s blockchains in minutes. Once they figure out a form of decryption that can withstand quantum computing, we might finally get a glimpse of the currency for the future.

Remind me again how the Internet works? Just “nodes” .... (servers) .... in space? I think your vision of the Internet might be slightly skewed. How are these “nodes” supposed tho verify transactions through the block chain? Just through space? Gosh, I hope you’re being sarcastic otherwise there’s no wonder this is crashing.

So 100% false? 
... kidding. It’s a programming joke. The “!” before a Boolean variable will inverse the value making it the opposite of its initial value.
