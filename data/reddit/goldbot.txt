I wish I had BtC to tip you guys, keep up the good work.

Coinbase is pretty simple to use! People may not like it as it seemingly invalidates anonymity, but anything that lowers the barrier to entry to the equivalent of enrolling in on-line bill pay is awesome. My grandma could use coinbase.

E'er upward, skyward ho!

Buying 100,000 bucks in Bitcoin 12 days ago (when you posted this comment) is a proven investment strategy.

I work in a hematopoietic stem cell lab.... I know if anyone sent us BtC, I'd use them to order plastic ware from places that accepted them, as well as reagents/antibodies/ flow cytometer time and ease up the taxpayer expense of having me as a grad student.
Far easier, cheaper, and just as helpful, as funding science at the bench would be to fund graduate student travel... I've spent 4 years picking and choosing over great conferences because we can only afford the one.
Start a site where you can buy 15ml conicals for bitcoin, for cheaper than Corning, and any scientist who has them will want to use them there!
Welcome to Reddit!

Did you follow the link? It's some scam or something climbing to sell BtC for obviously shady prices.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:55:11
Tell us that when they explode soon.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:58:37
Ignore it for 3 months, then have a look. Hourly they are volatile, long term they have always went up!

I think the appeal of coinbase, for me anyway, is how easy it is to use. My grandma could figure it out. That is well worth their fee, in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:38:12
How new are you to coding? You can do any thing you want now that the world markets are electronic.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:37:39
The whole thing has more impact.... 
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:49:57
That is lame! Science that doesn't get shared with others effectively never happened. That's what I was taught, anyway.

Bangyoulater.com + myfreepaysite.com (which my GIRLFRIEND told me about, yay her) will keep you chafed for months and months for free.

3050 BtC = 3050 BtC. Think of it like that.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:37:58
Gold isn't infinitely divisible... you can chop one gram up into (6.023*10^23 /197) distinct units, but that's as far as you can easily get.

If you are comfortable with coinbase go for it... for maximum security, go for a paper wallet.
You can then use coinbase as an intermediate to exchange it for money, or to purchase more coins.
At this point, I would move it offline. 500 bucks is a lot to risk losing!
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:49:14
The panic sell we could reap so many cheap coins! Maybe we should email some ditsy CNN "reporter".

No r/domesticviolence then.

It'll never catch on, the abacus has too much market share!
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:17:26
Yes, but only if you buy BtC from one party and sell it to another for a higher price.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:32:51
Share the wealth man!
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:32:06
Move it to a paper wallet. Coinbase provides the option to do this!
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:16:17
I prefer Durex.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:31:29
Plenty of people spent 600 smackers at Christmas with 0% chance of recovering ANY of it! Just think of it like that OP, you already win, even with a shot in the dark chance!
Good luck!

Send it to one of the wallets with invalid security keys. 0 people having access is more secure than 1!
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:14:41
That is true.

When a lot of British traitors decided to start their own little club that used this new-fanged thing called the "dollar", because near as I can tell they were tired of carrying around heavy money... (Lbs)
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:18:09
The dollar is far too risky of an investment to be useful as a backing currency.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:02:53
Awesome! Thanks man... And I think seeing it did indeed educate me enough to use it..Now I just gotta transfer in a bit more to be able to pay it forward on the next funny comment I read.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:54:19
What is this BtC?
Haha. I'm joking.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:02:56
I sent 100K USD to you... Just reddit tip me my BtC.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:59:23
You can make your own here.
