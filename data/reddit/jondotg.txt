Thank you. I will be saving this.
I especially appreciate your point that if we want crypto to be taken seriously, we must treat it seriously, and that involves paying your taxes properly.

While I like the idea of instant, no-fee transactions, I also like the immutability of the blockchain. This destroys that advantage.

I used your post in a blog entry on my site (with your permission). Here is the link.

If you use a credit card they credit purchases instantly. They are adding instant ACH (bank transfer) purchases this year. The problem is not with Coinbase, it's with the banking system. ACH only functions when banks are open and they have had some days off recently.
I purchased some on 12/23 for a [blog experiment]( and it will not be credited to my account until 1/3. The ACH system is very slow.
I find it funny, though, because once the coin is deposited you can transfer it to any exchange and start purchasing immediately (after enough confirmations). Shows the difference between traditional banking and crypto pretty well.

Sorry, I wasn’t clear. I meant that I like to have a record of the transaction on the blockchain where it is going to my physical wallet. You’re right that you still have the funds in your account, and if you’re using the exchange it accomplishes what you want easily and cheaply. I just hate the idea of letting them control it for too long.

If you believe that, I’ve got some land I’d like to sell you.
