I sold back in March. When bitcoin was around 12k. I was delusional not to sell while it feel from 20k to 15k

Nope just don’t understand why people don’t see the reality of the situation. People are losing ALOT of people because of holding and it’s continuing to go down. Based on technicals it’s going to retest 6k it’s inevitable

The less people interested in crypto, the less money flowing into crypto the less money flowing into bitcoin meaning the price of bitcoin will fall. Add one of those remind me things to my comment. End of August bitcoin will be less than it is now

The calm before 6k sounds better and it's a bit more accurate

Yeah and within that 1 hour your transfer could of increased or decreased by hundreds of dollars. Still not stable for large transfer amounts lol

Its not always about news. This time alot of is because of bitcoin breaking through multiple support levels. Read up on this to get you up to speed of what is happening

Let’s be honest no one gives a fuck about sats at the end of the day. Everyone cares about the price they can convert back into usd

Yeah all that is good and I agree. It’s more about new people getting into crypto. If they start to do their own research after seeing the ads they will discover more types of cryptos ect. Just worrying that new money won’t enter as it did back in December/January

If bitcoin breaks this last 9.2k support level watch how fast we will go down without news

I really don't understand how any of you would see this as good news. This will have a massive effect on gaining interest in crypto. Volumes are WAY down and this will just add to the effect of no new money flowing in. If you were to create a new product today besides word of mouth how would you market it to other people? If twitter were to follow the same would you also find that as good news? What about if they update youtubes policy to the same for content creators? Sometimes the delusion of some people really gets to me on this sub
