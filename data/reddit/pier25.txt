So long and thanks for all the fiat!
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:09:45
That was amazing

One has to wonder what is the purpose behind those declarations, considering they invested millions in Bitcoin from the Facebook lawsuit.
@_date: 2014-09-21 07:36:30
I'd say that Bitcoin is lucky to be alive. Who knows... what did you mean?
@_date: 2014-04-25 00:07:56
Let's say this happens. Would it work worldwide?
@_date: 2014-09-01 17:43:16


I'd love to do that, problem is I don't live in the US and this is difficult where I live. Only option I've found to pay in cash at 711 and the like is through localbitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-01 17:23:27
But does localbitcoins store the transaction details or associate the transactions with their accounts?
I'm new to bitcoins, but as I understand it, the transactions from wallet to wallet are always public. So unless localbitcoins registers the wallet details, the transactions could not be associated with a e-mail account.

So, localbitcoins does not store information on transactions, wallets, etc?


Yeah, that's what I've read :/

You can't assume all shady human affairs are just fantasy tales for pot smoking tin foil hatters just because they are called a conspiracy.

They are afraid, very afraid
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:35:52

European living in Mexico here. I agree.

He proved his point though
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:24:29
It is in my country, maybe not in the US.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:02:39
There is a crazy documentary on Netflix about that

Are you criticising fiction for being fictional? It's a tv show. It's sole purpose is to provide entertainment using fiction.
Also the perspective on the hacking world you are presenting is not the complete truth either. The recent Hacking Group scandal comes to mind.

The content on Erowid is good, but my god they really need a new website.

ASIC are not coins, but [a type of CPU]( You still mine Bitcoins.
Really, forget about mining on a gaming GPU. It's a waste of money and time.

I think using the Leo toast was a quality touch.
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:42:50
You are not answering his question.

I understand the ideological implications... but I have never in my life needed to pay anything in cash above a few hundred euros.

You can win money if you can stop betting after winning a certain amount. Of course if you go on forever you will lose. The more dice rolls, the more chances you will hit a long losing streak.
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:03:17
What I did was to bet very small amounts at 80%, and multiplying by 10 when I lost. It worked very well, until I lost 6 times in a row after thousands of dice rolls and lost everything.
