I LOL every time I see this bot with its communist quotes.

So... ever drive over the speed limit? Ever not fully stop at a stop sign? Ever let your meter expire and not drive away immediately? Ever download a torrent? Ever not report every single form of income you made on your taxes? Ever cross the street and not use a crosswalk? Ever smoke marijuana? Ever take a prescription drug for any reason without a prescription? Ever give alcohol to anyone under 21? Ever use a fake ID or fail to report someone who has?

LOL, get called out for a dumb opinion: "Uh, I was, uh, trolling... yeah, that's the ticket!"

I like how this bot has been banned 20 previous times.

I'm not sure what that means. If you're not wanting to work with the above definition, please offer another definition of criminals. Otherwise we will not know what we are discussing.

Sure. So, would "criminals" = "people who initiate violence or fraud on other people in order to get what they want" be a good general definition?
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:28:30
Very well. So if we are saying that "criminals" are those who initiate violence and fraud upon others, do we also agree that the initiation of violence and fraud upon others is immoral activity, and to be prohibited as a general rule?

The Gestapo were "cops" as were the NKVD and Smersh. To quote Martin Luther King, Jr.: "Never forget that everything Hitler did was legal." 
How would you "replace" those cops with new ones when the mission of the cops is oppression, murder, bigotry, and general evil? 
Also, what would you say to the families of those who were killed by the cops that you replaced? "Sorry your loved one is dead because we gave some random person the power of life and death. We promise this new guy will not abuse it and kill somebody else."

How are you defining "criminals?" Who is a bigger criminal? The guy who smokes a leaf, or the guy who beats him half to death and throws him in a cell for doing it?
