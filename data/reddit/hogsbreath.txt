I get the impression you don't even have a business to crowdfund, you're just looking for handouts.
Doesn't the sidebar say "Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy."?

What's the difference between legitimate and illegitimate homelessness?
If your economic circumstances are that dire, why are you fucking around with Bitcoin and crowdfunding? Shouldn't you just get a job? 
Why would someone want to invest in a business run by someone who's about to be homeless? Why should we think you're going to be working on the business, versus looking for cans &amp; bottles or panhandling on freeway offramps or something? 
Doesn't your inability to manage your own money effectively suggest that it may not be wise to trust you with other people's money?

I tell people that my invoices are prepared/denominated using dollars (because that's how I pay my rent and payroll, for a start) but I'm willing to accept payment in an equivalent amount of BTC.

Nobody does this because of the risk of chargebacks on the credit card side of the transaction.

What you're seeing is people who have a shiny new toy searching for new ways to play with it. 
Deeds and property records need to be useful for *centuries* - so it's awfully early to talk about something as fragile and new as Bitcoin in that context. 
In the United States, recorders' offices are barely getting comfortable with non-digitally-signed PDF's; and that's an old technology that closely mirrors previous functionality/appearance.

Perhaps you could explain why it's important that we know your gender before helping you with an ecommerce question.
Since this seems to be a for-profit venture, have you considered paying someone to help you?

Mining would be *really* inefficient at the $/watt cost of running gas/diesel/propane fueled generators; so the blockchain will stop if somehow all traditional utility power became unavailable. It's pretty unlikely that we would lose utility power globally yet still have otherwise functioning electronics/networks.

Is it possible the tx fee comment refers to the USD side? I have a merchant account for VISA/MC, it costs me .35+3% to receive USD that way, which eats up a lot of a $1 purchase.

Supposedly there's one in Valley Fair Mall in San Jose/Santa Clara, haven't seen it personally.
