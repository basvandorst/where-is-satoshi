This is very reasonable on their part. Bitcoin mining is a process that takes up as much as processing power as there is.
Even tho you pay a price for "1 CPU CORE" or "4 CPU CORES" or whatever, you are not strictly limited to your virtual CPU speed, they allow bursts of CPU usage as high as 100% of the hypervisor speed, just so if you have a CPU demanding task such as some batch process that needs to be done daily, you can do it, without it taking for ages. But you can't use all of the CPU power selfishly because it will cause problems for you hypervisor "neighbours". They expect you to keep your usage "inside" your HV share, and be fair.
If you think they made a wrong judgement and you didn't mine on that droplet, or you think you were hacked (which still IMO is your fault) and the attacker ran the mining software, let them know. I'm sure they will help you out.

You can do either. I usually do by trust and my via references from my past clients. But if you really feel unsafe, you can use an escrow, it is all in the hands of you and the client, J4B is just a place to find workers/clients.

They could be recognized since everything is connected to a chain.
But what even if you do that, you can't just stop accepting the "stolen" bitcoins, if you would do that it would stop being a currency. Imagine if you had to check if the bitcoins you are recieving are "stolen" every time someone needed to send you some.

Only ones rubbing their hands right now is bitstamp.

They didn't loose them all in 5 minutes by one person. That is the amount lost over the years by everyone exploiting the double-spending attack.
It could be thousands of different people if not more.

What the hell is going on, seriously,  I don't even understand any of this. Who is dragon,  was it really that hard to reach dorian that you didn't speak for weeks? 
Am I the only one to which this makes no sense at all?

It's still a coin some people invested all of their life savings in...

It's like all the people in the comments are reading a completely different post. I was starting to question my sanity.
"What did those people read that they can discuss so well?"

Kinda ironic since it was the simplest way to buy it, up until a few months ago. :D

Hell no, I will be broke in a week.
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:41:48
Yup, excited as well!

I got it! Let's give  them gox bitcoin as bounty, if there is noone willing to take it, we know what is going on. :D

It blows my mind when I look at this. You can see every transaction, any person in the world sending some money via Bitcoin in real time. Having something like that in a palm of your hand.  
So cool! :)

YouTube isn't decentralized. It is a central entity and its data needs to be kept at one location only. The blockchain, however, has to be up to date on every node.

Don't bash a honest company if you don't know what you are talking about.
If you take a look at AWS security standards you will see that is way above anything a company of that size can do.
