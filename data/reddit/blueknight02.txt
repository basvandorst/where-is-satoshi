I will ban nothing. My hopes is to create a common agenda amongst a community that will be promoted through the use voting. If we are determined, we can silence users who are counter productive to our end goal of advancing bitcoin through the use of downvotes.
All opinions are welcome as long as they are presented in a civil and constructive manner.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:55:28
But *it is* decentralized in the fact the community as a whole decides the agenda. One of the main points Im trying to convey is that a dedicated group can achieve incredible heights when working cooperatively and productively. There is no need for BTC foundations or the like when we have thousands of passionate people who are all personally invested in this technology for one reason or another.
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:56:13
I'm all for the idea. But This is not the way to go about it. There are many sites that help you find Web developers, and even some specific to Bitcoin. It took me a while to learn this, but reddit is not a place for business
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:20:58
This sub will strictly enforce a positive and productive agenda with a consistent goal of benefiting the bitcoin network. 
But this will not be the only difference. It will be up to the community to decide together, how to be better. And there are countless ways to accomplish that

I want to emphasize that this is not an attempt to copy is an attempt to create a decentralized community with a the single goal of advancing bitcoin. Bitcoin has made extraordinary advancements in just 6 short years because of efforts like this. I feel it is my responsibility to contribute, and I hope many of you feel the same.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:04:44
I couldn't agree more brother. When I first got involved here, there was a feeling of magic. The sense that anything is possible. The realization that we can all make a difference. That is what made me a believer. 
But you bring up the point of being passive, and you couldnt have been more spot on! This subreddit has lost the passion it once had. More and more people are leaving it up to their neighbor to contribute. But this very much against the philosophy that bitcoin embodies. Come to and help revive this community
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:22:14
Just goes to show how broken is... I tried repyling earlier then saw your comment had been deleted. Heres what I said
I appreciate your comment. I enjoy a good read and will have to check out Mr.Mill's work. I too believe in freedom of speech, and I think you, like many, have misunderstood my stance. I want this community to discuss the good and bad of bitcoin. All its flaws, all its successes, everything. But the main difference with will be the tone of such speech. There is no defending the use of hateful or offense speech. The goal is to promote an environment where that kind of nonsense is unacceptable. And for the community works as a democracy to minimize it.
I hope you better understand my hopes for this new subreddit, and I hope to see you in there helping us build bitcoins future.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:54:59
Moe did his best to accommodate the community while putting on the best show possible. Imo, he succeeded. I was at the convention and I absolutely loved the experience. The venue was **INCREDIBLE.** ...But it wasn't free to use. To put on these conventions(which are valuable in my opinion) you need capital, a lot of it. Paybase, being one of the biggest sponsors, probably dropped tens of thousands of dollars to be a premiere sponsor. Without that funding, the show may not have been possible.
Unfortunetely some people lost money because this guy. While his tactics may have been shady, any investment is a risk. Everyone should be aware of this, or you probably should not be in bitcoin(seriously). 
The way I look at it, everyone who bought into Gaw actually helped contribute to the production of TNABC in Miami. That may not be what the victims want to here, but they did indirectly help bitcoin by doing so. Theres a silver lining to everything.

To be honest, I want these decisions to be made by the community. Maybe referring to each other in a constant derogative manner will produce results. And if so, lets do it.

Brother, do need feed the hostility. You have misunderstood me. I do not plan on enforcing anything. Life I have mentioned, "It will be up to the community to decide together, how to be better."
It is somber to see someone who is so against an idea that is just trying to benefit this technology that we all love. My only goal is to create a community that feels like a community. If you are truly against that, than we are hopeless

Unfortunately, trolls are a reality. So should we just give up and continue to let them rule? I think not.

My friend, these are the exact discussions I hoped to create. When we share the experiences of many, we are able to create a more whole perspective.

It is our most effective weapon. And it is no longer present in this sub.

The Big Short by Michael Lewis truly brings the reader Inside of the Doomsday Machine. It reads like a fictional drama novel consisting of a main conflict so heinous, it’s seemingly untrue. But this story is not of fiction. Lewis provides real, first hand accounts detailing the outrageous ignorance that led to the worldwide economic meltdown of 2007; While simultaneously exposing the structural flaws of the financial system that brought forth this catastrophe. Lewis provides sufficient evidence that the system is in dire need of being updated. Otherwise, we will all pay for the mistakes of the few...again.
Michael Lewis spends a great deal of time describing the savages who built the nuclear bomb that was Sub-Prime Mortgage Backed Securities. While also in-depthly following the brave men and woman who eventually set off this trillion dollar bomb(Lewis 225). Michael Lewis, himself, was inside the cold heart of this machine in the 1980’s. He promptly left after he made some money and realized how totally preposterous this system really is. “Sooner rather than later,” Lewis then thought, “Someone is going to identify me, along with a lot of people more or less like me, as a fraud. Sooner rather than later would come a Great Reckoning”(Lewis Prologue). This Great Reckoning didn’t come for two more decades. In that time, it grew to proportions larger than anyone, including Lewis, could have foreseen. It required a few very unique individuals that were able to recognize the problem, and more importantly, stand up against it. While everyone else was profiting and praising the market, individuals like Michael Burry risked it all and bet against the trend. Dr. Michael Burry suffered from Asperger’s Syndrome which made it trouble for him to fit in socially. He preferred to stay home alone reading prospectuses or rebuilding his computer. Some would refer to his syndrome as a disability, but Burry felt that financial markets were an ideal route for someone like him to excel in. He obsessed over obtaining cold hard facts. “Only someone with Asperger’s would read a subprime mortgage bond prospectus,” said Burry. And it was true. Instead of reading the actual content and evaluating the real risks for themselves, the majority of players relied solely on third parties; Whether it was a big rating agencies or their genius buddy who invented the thing. They were all wrong. Just as Lewis bluntly mentions in the Prologue, very large sums of money were given to naive young who men gambled and lost. “One trillion dollars in losses had been created by American financiers, out of whole cloth, and embedded in the American financial system.”(Lewis 225) And we are left to pay. Through indirect and seemingly invisible ties, our financial system enabled the wealthy Wall Street bankers to pass on their losses to the US taxpayer. Even after the fact, the citizens of America have continued to put their trust in these institutions despite the havoc that they wreak on our society. Lewis succinctly sums up the issue, “The people in position to resolve the financial crisis, were, of course, the very same people who had failed to see it...They had proven far less capable of grasping basic truths in the heart of the U.S. financial system than a one-eyed money manager with Asperger’s syndrome.”(260) If our nation is to sustain and prosper, we must radically restructure our financial system. We cannot continue to put our trust, money, and livelihood in the hands of the irresponsible.
One underlying issue with modern finances is the need for trust.  In today’s finance, it is impossible to interact without trust. You must trust that your bank will have your funds when you want them. Which wasn’t the case in the Greece recently. And even cash requires trust. When a US Dollar is transacted, both parties must trust that the United States government is backing that piece of cloth. While it seems like such an obvious fact, most people do not realize how heavily they are relying on these agencies.  When buyers of subprime mortgage bonds trusted that the major ratings agencies accurately assessed them, the atom had split. A nuclear chain reaction of devastatingly poor financial decisions had begun. During this time, middle-men like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were generating significantly increased profits from all the action, so they neglected reality. Why wouldn’t they? They were making enormous returns, and their risk was “backed” by the government. “The problem was the system of incentives that channeled greed”(Lewis 257). The capital management entities had no incentive to play fair. So they didn’t. And when they were caught cheating, most were given what can only be described as a slap on the wrist, followed by a pat on the butt ushering them to, “Get back out there and try again, kid!” The individuals who allowed this debacle to ensue, are the same individuals who continue to run the show. There was no foundational upheaval in the system. The average citizen was too busy scavenging their scraps that they had neglected to truly assess the real issue at hand. We continue to use this same system, with the same management. If the free market truly exists anymore, then it will mandate that our system be replaced with an efficient and modern alternative. 
We are all operating in a systematically broken and outdated financial system. A system that was designed for a different socioeconomic time. It worked fairly well for quite a while. But now our world is advancing faster than ever. Entirely new obstacles face us on the horizon. These obstacles will require entirely new systems to be met with. When faced with these issues, one may turn to government, or some other central agency for answers. Most are unsure of how to deal with an issue themselves, so the issues of many are pseudo-solved by the very few. The very few who likely don’t even share the same dilemma. Resulting in the majority fighting an uphill battle, blind to the nature of their own struggle. This is the type of behavior that modern government promotes. By attempting to serve the endless needs of millions, they are actually inhibiting the individual's essential need to think for themselves.  These agencies pretend to be the host of our society, when they are in fact the leech. The true host is the network of individuals that we call average citizens. Yet the people can not even begin to comprehend the extent of their own power because it has been purposely obfuscated.  Nobody fixed the system because nobody understood the system. The shenanigans that occurred in our system were so confusing and complex that it required an award winning author to write an entire novel dedicated to shedding light on it’s failure.

This is exactly why I'm trying to be careful

I interpreted his comments in a different way. Just like his analogy of allowing good bacteria fight bad bacteria, he implies we need to allow good actors to use bitcoin because bad actors will use whether or not it's restricted.

While I agree that his comments are crazy(and entertaining at that), I don't think we can classify him as a troll.

"All Market transactions go to a “World” wallet. Each time a monster is killed, a small number of calculations (and luck) might substract 200 bits from that wallet directly to yours, a small reward for your braveness. If you choose to spend that money again inside the Market, it will go back to the world wallet, rewarding another player."

What do you think about Bitreserve/Uphold? I can just lock it to the dollar for now I suppose. But one may also assume that another fully compliant US company may have the same sanctions.

Wouldn't you rather be the one in control of this information on the blockchain. As opposed to having a company having sole control of it.

This is big. This is good

What do you mean by Cryptonote based currency

But what gives Monero these advantages? Who's to say bitcoin miners will actively ban certain addresses. Because that most likely will not be the case, IMO. That's the advantage of a decentralized network. If enough dirty money wanted to bypass said blacklisting, they'd be able to start mining and confirm the transaction on their own

OP. I, too, am sitting here watching charts

You forgot to link the video

Snapchat released a new news section called discover. It's actually really great, and the vice video of bitcoin definitely reached an audience it otherwise wouldn't have

What's so wrong about a poem describing what he believes in?
