How can you be sooo calm? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:17:38
I've been into btc and alts for several months, can't say more than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:06
About a week
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:59:55
Unlikely, but you'll definitely get profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:55:55
Why is that relevant? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:43
You honestly think this is gonna crash?! Seems a little difficult now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:36:51
Hodling = staying in fit the long run, which is 2-3 years at least in my opinion. So did you sell everything? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:22:00
That's a mature approach, "definitely" was a bit pushed, I take it back. But history tells us if you put money into btc and hodl, you'll most likely profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:04:10
That's the case most of time, but not always. 
I would say 1 out of 10 times everything goes down because in some cases it's the safest way to keep the profits (i.e. Cash out) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:55:18
What do you mean exactly by "bullshit sign"? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:57:33
Did you say pandacoin?
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:51:18
Yep, happens sometimes. Market behavior. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:16
Not for me man, I don't have enough in it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:16:30
How about "probably"? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:51
Haha I see what you did there, but I mean "dip" as in an obvious local minimum. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:06:58
Don't get me wrong, I'm still just speculating, you could be right. But years of historical data to count on is a little better than nothing at all. And that tells us that the price will probably go up again. But hey we can't predict the future, it could rise above 20k or go lower than 10k in the next 20 days. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:58:46
Ah my bad. Looking at history the price always rises after it falls. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:08:40
That's exactly the scenario in *most* cases. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:47:38
Yes, I honestly do. I know it's a long shot, but I really want it, ultimately, to be the main world currency. If it does not, I'm positive it'll be at least a currency that's accepted everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:53
16.5 already
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:16
I sincerely hope so. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:58:04
5/7, would buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:13:08
Free dive today...
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:57:23
You misspelled NEO
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:23:10
Well... Already bought, so I lost some, I'll wait for a slope change before buying. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:13:24
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:34:25
It's being regulated in China, that's why the price is dropping I think, but I didn't go into further details. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:56:18
It's just news 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:38:44
No shit? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:57:03
None taken. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:34:42
Oh I see. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:37:00
It may hit 6000 then go as low as 5000 before exploding again. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:07:50
Visa or Mastercard 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:36:31
Rn, before bitcoin hits 10.000$, putting **any** sum of money on bitcoin is worth it. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:35:00
I might be a bit, but don't you think it's stalling a bit? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:07:41
We're all hoping for that, man. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:32:33
Good call, maybe try to make it 300$ a month instead of 100$ a week, and not just in btc, put 50% in btc and 50% in volatile altcoins and try to trade the altcoins if you have time. Because, as mentioned before, now, with small investments, you won't a become a millionaire in 3 years with bitcoin. You have a better chance of doing that in ethereum, ripple, litecoin, neo (good opportunity now), and even in more volatile ones (i.e TenX, nlc2, xlm, Lunyr, safex, etc...) 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:12:57
1btc could be around 52xx$ on Monday, why not use other services like cex.io ? why do you insist on using Gdax? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:22:52
I do agree, however, if you're reasoning exponentially, when we hit the plateaux and profits become smaller and smaller, some whales might jump off. I think that's a possible scenario, but it won't have a huge effect on the crypto market. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:06:26
You know you can directly buy from cex.io right? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:02:35
That's exactly my point, it's like people are waiting for the crash again, that's why it's stalling I think. In 5k we didn't stall at all, it went down immediately and then steadily got back, it's not the same scenario.
