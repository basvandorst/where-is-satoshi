How is it to be a woman on reddit ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:58:28
Hi, here would be my recomandations:
-Wikipedia (everyone uses it and nobody wants to miss it)
-maybe you could spend some on advertising bitcoin itself?
-Andreas lf course! 
-and please for me, use some of your bitcoin and buy your mum, dad, grandparents whatever, something they always wanted or would be happy to have. We really don‘t apreciate our families enough and before we can blink twice some of them are already gone. 
I really like what you are doing here :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:47:08
Totally understandable.
But there are a lot more subreddits especially for men than for woman right?
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:23:03
Hey it's me your lost brother. haha :D
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:03:11
even if bitcoin reaches 1M. I would only be 10k. I highly doubt it would ever be worth 100k...
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:25:54
I think I will never own enough BTC to afford any of these. But it is a nice dream :)
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:10:02
to which price it will come down again ? 
cheers for your winning ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:49:07

@_date: 2017-08-31 16:35:56

Any other crypto that would be worth investing in ? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:20:35

I wish I would be a poor student if 1 BTC will reach 500k I really want to own 1 whole btc until then haha.
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:30:48
Thx for the cheer, I will ! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:34:14
Yeah I read it twice ! better to stay with BTC and dont listen to any sort of ICO at the moment
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:19:38

Yes, I want another dip to 4k ! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:39:24
But how risky would it be do loose money you don't have. 
As always: Just invest, what you are willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:31:40
at least I do it this way
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:46:58
For me as a user, do I get more BTC mining altcoins with Nicehash or do I get more BTC by mining BTC directly ?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:45:03
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:48:37

@_date: 2017-11-17 16:06:49
and then there are people like me:
during the dip: damn, I wish I would have some spare money to spend on BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:14:55
I want to buy, but money is short right now.
Feels so bad. such a hard dip yesteday and today and no money to invest. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:07:01
.33 BTC for a Cheeseburger?!
no thanks
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:34:47


@_date: 2017-11-16 17:46:12
nah, I don't even smoke or drink. 
I am just a poor student with a lot of debt...
I would be happy to just pay off my debt with it haha
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:07:53
I scaled it a little bit up and gave it a lit bit more color. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:36:28

@_date: 2017-09-01 15:40:10

@_date: 2017-09-01 16:27:30

@_date: 2017-09-01 10:35:46
Holy moly
 100 BTC !
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:40:42
same boat
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:05:00
nop haha
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:52:16
That sounds kind of smart !
I dont think that you will loose your phone or anything on your breadwallet in the next 3-4 weeks.
I just got a Nano S and as CoinManagerr said, I think if you have bought more than 500€ in BTC you should get it, maybe this 0.25 bitcoin will be 10.000 one day, better save it :D
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:59:24
How much did you buy ?
What kind of amounts are avaible for purchase ?
