It was just a renaming of .3 to 1.3. instead of listening to him they went to .3 then .4. 
"But 1.0 sounds like the first release. For some things newness is a virtue but for this type of software, maturity and stability are important. I don't want to put my money in something that's 1.0. 1.0 might be more interesting for a moment, but after that we're still 1.0 and everyone who comes along thinks we just started. This is the third major release and 1.3 reflects that development history. (0.1, 0.2, 1.3)" --Satoshi 2010-06-27

It's just a website you host on your desktop computer except worse because they redesigned websites from scratch in a bad new format.

Seems like you have found a flaw in adoption: as the price goes up people feel like they got in too late and want things to drive the price back down.

Bitcoin is doomed to fail when all the flaws it has start being held up as secretly some secret intelligence test to weed out "stupid people".

Good job linking to a comment to try and make it look like he is saying he works real hard on implementing bitcoin all day instead of linking to the correct comment that says: 
"My guess (since I really don't have an idea) is that they're aren't too many people who would pay with Bitcoin who wouldn't pay with another method, making it uneconomical for us to spend the development time when we could be adding something for people like our Estonian friend here."

Literally no matter what the default fee is, if everyone uses it, it won't be enough. Everyone could put a fee of 4000 dollars and you'd need to put 4001 dollars to be the guy offering more than everyone else.

It's the logical flaw in "default fees", whatever the default fee is, if everyone follows it it'll be too low.

A lot of people mistakenly think that bitcoin invented private/public key cryptography and are really shoehorning bitcoin/blockchains in thinking they are a part of stuff like signatures.

It's not incorruptible at all. It can be changed by consensus, altcoins running virtually the same code have had transactions reversed because devs agree to reverse stolen coins, bitcoin itself had 50 blocks worth of transactions reversed to overwrite all blocks containing coins from an early bug that created extra coins. miners can overwrite transactions at will if they gain a majority of the network or 51% of the miners agree to discard blocks (currently 51% of miners means two miners). 
There is plenty of mechanisms for bitcoin transactions to be reversed.  It's just a thing that needs community agreement. Or at most it requires devs or miners to just do it and have ENOUGH agreement that other people only grumble instead of mutiny.

Okay, but again, proving my point that it'd be easy to misuse exchange budgets then pretend it's the agents from whatever shadowy organization you are accusing me of coming from doing the DDoS.

As it is vaporware it is whatever you want it to be and solves all problems and has no flaws. 
Lets see someone produce some actual functional code then people can decide if it's actually a good idea or not.

You've never noticed how many posts about "trading engine problems" exchanges have when the price is falling?

Literally proving my point that boogiemen are easy to generate in the bitcoin community.

He released version 1.3 a little after that, saying no one would trust a pre 1.0 currency but the other core devs ignored his wishes and reverted back to fractional release numbers.

You made money by other people losing money. It's not just magic free money from no where.

Are they real DDoS attacks or are they just poorly run businesses that use DDoS as an excuse to hire bottom rate web hosting and low quality web engineers so a large part of the bitcoin website ecosystem crashes any time interest goes up even slightly. Then blame it on spooky boogymen instead of their own short sighted and quick buck centered resource planning. 
"sorry guys, we spent our whole web budget on these new cars, but don't worry, every time traffic goes up we can just blame our poor service on evil bankers or something, the gullible audience will eat that shit up"

I'm sure it can, but it's just standard cryptographic key stuff people are talking about and either mistakenly thinking that requires a blockchain or intentionally trying to mislead people into thinking it requires buying THEIR blockchain.

Yeah, until people naturally select not to use bitcoin because of this stuff happening nonstop all the time.

Nothing about investment in bitcoin can be called "safe"
