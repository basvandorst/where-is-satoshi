There are tons of people who will be just fine. There will always be stupid people out there, someone is replying to phishing emails and whatnot. Those who fail, will reap the consequences as you would if you sent your life saving to a “Prince” in Kenya. You lose.
Our IQ was above triple digits when we were solely  European immigration.

Well it’s kinda hard to trade off the exchange. Until Trust wallet and DEX rolls out...
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:11:33
I use bots and manually trade and have great results.

How he fuck so? I’m putting my hard earned dollars into Bitcoin. I’m taking risk. What’s my reward?
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:54:45
Well I work hard for my money, very hard, then I invest it, stocks and Bitcoin. How do you figure I do nothing. You have no idea what I do for a living, which you couldn’t do.

Well I can carry hundreds of thousands dollars worth of crypto on my ledger and no one will bat and eye.

Good job, 401k is a scam. Look at how it came to be. Slow lane to wealth, if that.

Would the Quant Network (QNT) do something like this?

Need the moonboys to lose all hope before we move from bear.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:06:06
With a question like that, don’t even buy any bro.

Moonboys need to get rekt beyond belief before we hit bottom. Until they vow to never touch crypto again, we will continue to drop. The good news is there is a lot of fear and negative sentiment out there. We’re getting close but no there yet. I’m in a long short and believe there is more drops to come.

Look at the daily RSI.
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:52:35
Cmon, you don’t think there isn’t going to be a shakeout soon? We are definitely not in the disbelief stage. Need a few more rallies and drops, then moonboys will not be so optimistic. Theeeeen, we are in the bull market.

Been in it since 2013 and every bear it’s the same sentiment. They will see.

Hold half, trade with bots the other half.

You know governments have confiscated gold in times of crisis right? You do know that?

The fuck, you have to pay 50% of your pay? Why isn’t she paying child support? Man, so many terrible decisions here. It’s a crazy deal because you became a doormat instead of standing up for yourself and child and making sure things were fair. Lawyer up yesterday, Jesus son.

Wtf bro, are you retarded? Who let you on the internet?
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:41:03
The fuck? Conspiracy theorists? Projection much? Sounds like a no coiner.
