So did I and I didnt fail, maybe I used a bit strange phrasing - sorry for that.
Here we go:
" I dont see a reason why they would buy something with no fee (or the upcoming small one) "

Thanks for brining so much motivation into your position.
I think some years ago we would have never expected how big this whole internetstuff will become.
Nowadays if you look at concerns like google or amazon, you have no idea who is behind this company. 
At this point ChangeTip is completly different - you as your own individual person speak to us and everyone himself.
Keep going this way !
Thats what we need, thats how you are and thats why we love you !
Nobody needs some more automatic generated stuff for the "random surfer".
Thats one of the bad sites of the internet, everyone is losing his individuality and being recognized as a single person "bit by bit".
Is this the reason for the name CHANGEtip !?
Keep up the good work !

You realized that I wrote  about the upcoming small fee ?! ;)

Bits seem to be an official currency somehow

banned for tipping ? - "OH MY GOD - don't give away free money !"
I don't get it. U sure it was human what banned you ?

Tipping owns any other money-transactions. Theres no fee and it's instant.
Almost perfect ;)

Amazon ? probably not ...
Google ? they will just start there own "changetip" - it's no big deal to integrate it in their existing software.
Paypal ? I dont see a reason why they would buy something with no fee (or the upcoming small one)
Paypal belongs to ebay and if you sell/buy something there they charge 2 or 3 times and not small amounts.
So if they would really show interest, please Mr. Gorillamania - don't sell it to paypal/ebay.
I hope it's you who will have to decide this !
But why not just stay with ? It will become big soon ...
Good luck with that !

This reddit stuff is really going through roof it seems. Not at least because of Changetip.

Just lost 0.4 BTC for gambling :(
I should have better tipped it ...

This is a great idea, what are you going to do with a room full of likes ?!?!? 
I have no idea - but with BITCOIN the options are almost infinite.
Changes are good and changes are needed. But never change too much as humans themself hate any changes.
Its very important for changetip that it will never lose its personality !
