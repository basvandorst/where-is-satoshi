Gosh, I bet you'll be the envy of just about everyone with that kickin' rad story.

How do you think you can be fair and impartial while completing ignoring the disadvantages and risks?
@_date: 2015-05-18 17:27:43
From their perspective, yes. Success in modern business demands continual growth. From an outsider's perspective, if Bitcoin's current low levels of usage is at all acceptable, it is only acceptable because they still consider Bitcoin to be in the early stages of development. If Bitcoin is still at 100K daily transactions in a fully developed stage, then that is a very bad thing.

Then you can rejoice in the fact that those who say that Bitcoin is dead or will die are *technically* incorrect (which again, isn't even what most of those articles say). But I suspect that from their point of view, Bitcoin is *effectively* dead if it never makes up more than a non-negligible percentage of currency transactions -which so far is accurate.
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:21:36
Most of these articles aren't actually stating that Bitcoin is dead. The ones that I skimmed are claiming that it will never be a mainstream currency, which so far is completely accurate.
It is dumb to say that Bitcoin will ever completely die. At the very least, there will always be a couple of die-hard people running nodes and miners, passing coins back and forth, even if BitPay and Coinbase go under, no other companies replace them, and no major companies accept Bitcoin. So judging Bitcoin's success based solely on its "dead or alive" status is silly.

I hope that this is just some idiotic imaginary conversation that you've only fantasized about having. Actually winking and saying that would inspire such outrageous douche chills.

Can you provide any proof that people said only pirates and child molesters use the internet back in the 90s? Or is it just a baseless argument that you've seen other dolts post on this subreddit enough, so you've accepted it as gospel?

So the computer running your software would need to have 2 Ethernet ports, or am I misunderstanding something?

Each day, how many people will be within X meters of your home, need a wireless signal (and not have a cell phone with a data plan), can't find an open (free) network, use Bitcoin, and are actually willing to pay whatever price it is you set? It's vanishingly small, and in my opinion not worth the development time. I'll be blown away if this sees even slight usage in the real world.
But I think you should do it anyway, but just because nothing's funnier to me than watching a project crash and burn, particularly when it's preceded by ridiculous confidence and ignorance by its creators (see: Mt. Gox, BFL, Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, countless cloud mining services, Reddit Notes, etc.).

The title says that they're experiencing "continued growth," but the article itself says they've seen "consistent bitcoin transaction volume." Which is it?
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:34:31
If people actually used bitcoin to send money and discussed it online, then that'd probably do the trick. But instead, it appears that the few people who do use it do so as an ineffectual get-rich-quick scheme that only pays out in an impossible libertarian wet-dream.
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:40:02
Just because I'm not participating in your ridiculous bitcoin echo chamber doesn't mean that I'm trolling. I genuinely believe every word in my original post.
@_date: 2015-04-06 02:58:34
Neither do I.  Good discussion.
@_date: 2015-04-04 13:52:24
Through your masterful discourse, I have seen the errors of my way. Thanks buddy!
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:16:42
Oh, I wasn't being serious. I still think bitcoin is dumb as fuuuuuck.
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:31:45
Yes, learn your history: hoarding of gold was causing massive deflation, paralyzing the economy, and sending the world into a deeper and deeper depression.  And yet many people somehow think that bitcoin ultimately being deflationary is a GOOD thing.  (You can quibble that Hayek and Rothbard blame the government's involvement in industry for the Great Depression, but the vast majority of historians and economists disagree with that.  It'd be like siding with the 3% of climate scientists who deny that humans are causing climate change.)
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:57:44
edit: I genuinely believe every word in this post, too.

1 year ago you uploaded a video to YouTube ( saying that Litecoin was going to see a huge influx of investment and adoption. I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that this actually happened. When you talk about the impending success of Bitcoin today, are you more or less confident than you were when you were previously promoting Litecoin? Is it possible that, just as your faith in Litecoin wasn't particularly fruitful, that the same could happen with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:48:25
Do I "still" stand by it? I never stood by it in the first place. But yes: this is a bad idea that will not succeed regardless of whether it's backed by Ryan "bitcoin in javascript" Charles or anyone else, for all the reasons I've already described. 
By the way - sick burn by repeatedly suggesting that I live with my mom. It's really clever stuff, and it's totally made me reevaluate my view on bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:48:14
I didn't backpedal from "crash and burn." I'd still like to see that, although "crashing and burning" requires some level of momentum, and it's pretty clear that this project isn't going anywhere.

I live a few hundred feet away from a metro station in Washington DC. I'm seriously looking out my window and can see dozens of people waiting for a train right now. But I would never waste my time installing this software. Think about it: let's say there are 1,000 people who wait near my apartment each day. According to a Pew study ( 60% of adults use their cell phones to access the Internet. Let's say that 5% of those remaining people actually have a need to access the internet while waiting there. And let's assume (generously) that there are 1 million active Bitcoin users in the US. 
1000\*(1-.6)\*.05*(1 million / 314 million) = .06 people per day. And then that person needs to actually be willing to pay whatever price it is that I've established. Let's say half of people do that.  That's 1 person every month using my Internet connection, and I live in a pretty ideal location.
You can quibble over the specifics of each assumption (1000 people passing by isn't the target location, maybe you think more people need internet access, or that bitcoin acceptance is much higher or will be in the near future, etc.) - this is just a back-of-the-envelope estimate (and I can quibble the opposite - that people who use bitcoin are MUCH more likely to already have a mobile data plan, and so forth). But you really have to alter the assumptions pretty radically before this becomes a worthwhile endeavor.
Also - you just said that there are hundreds of thousands of people already doing this. In other words, this is a saturated market. And yet it's a good opportunity for bitcoin? Doesn't make sense. I also don't want anonymous people using my Internet connection for god knows what, but that's a topic that has already been discussed to death.
