Allegations which have been without proof for over a year now, nothing new about any of it and you added as much to them. If you call that 'only relaying' them, then the Crusaders were also 'only relaying' their faith in the East.


You mean, you seized the moment to try and abuse the indignation of all Bitfinex clients and people present to focus their attention on unproven allegations and yourself while going around talking down to and 'warning' people about engaging with you. What a shameful display.


No, don't try to mingle or use the indignation of others with your empty shell of allegations and attention-seeking, but considering your course of action so far I guess allegations without merit are a trademark of yours. If only you could fill the void of meaningful content in your speeches with the quality of your words.

They made their statements based on the evidence they found so far. You made your statements out of which evidence? The unavailability of yours?

I have no knowledge what the terms were for any of the currencies handled. I currently also can't access any of it as their site seems to be down except for the announcements.

That's easy, because limits aren't supposed to stop legitimate trades. There maybe isn't a way to lift them, but certainly to increase them when needed otherwise you would limit your business from the start when you have no idea how big you can grow. The question is just what do you have to do? Use your BitGo account? Call someone? None of that means BitGo was compromised.

Pompous speeches filled with empty words. The irony of that is indeed amusing.

What were the security measures bypassed? How were they bypassed?
Gathering all information posted around here, it sounded more like the intruder had all information he needed to make a legitimate withdraw which doesn't concern any normal security measures. According to the more legitimate information floating around here, limits and most other measures could be circumvented with Bitfinex's BitGo Account, keys were compromised - how does any of this mean BitGo had been compromised too when none of the former has to indicate the latter?

To make it simple - that usually depends on whether the BTC given to them became their assets or not. You can give a bank 1000€ to invest, they become their assets, they can lose them or if you give a bank 1000€ to safe-keep in their vault without them ever becoming the bank's assets. In a case of theft in the first case the bank would be able to compensate from all of their assets including your 1000€ in the second case they wouldn't be. Keep in mind this is a rather simplified explanation and doesn't take anything else into consideration for the sake of this explanation.
It doesn't matter whether they were in individual user's wallets, it matters whether the content of these wallets were their assets or yours.
