This is great news for the bitcoin community, hopefully more countries will follow Japan,  but I see people complaining that we need Layer 2 because the network will be congested,  Well in my opinion bitcoin is almost 10 years now, for it to work it means the governments of the world need to start adopting it, if they don't adopt it with in its first 10 years, then when? I think is the right time, this will help improve the bitcoin network.
