I am so happy that there are people like you on reddit, that have all the knowledge in the world, being able to judge whether a question is stupid or not! And even if a business school is shit only by somebody asking a question! That is awesome!!!!You are the most intelligent person I've me so far! So happy that people/gods like you are allowed to interact with other people and showing them the right way! Thank you for telling me what to do with my life! Are you god?

I asked for opinions and not knowledge. With reference to your kind yet antisocial reply, I can tell your social skills are below the level required to contribute to human mankind. So good luck with getting successful, you'll need it

Thank you for your thoughts! I get your point ��thinking of it as a further part of the financial system is also the way I think about it. And for sure, at the time volatility is allowing it to grow! I am curious about opinions on this topic since I met someone who argued that cryptocurrencies will REPLACE every other currency - which I found very unrealistic

That is also what I observed. Totally agree, the more users the less voltile��I am curious about your opinions since I met someone who argued that cryptocurrencies will REPLACE all fiat currencies, which I found hard to believe, so I was curious about other opinions on this! Thank you for your comment

Totally agree on your point! Seeing it as a system, it is totally trustworthy. I just see a big downside of decentralization that you can't offer price stability to consumers  (if like everyone would use it). You could literally buy a TV for 1 BTC and the next day BTC is worth 30% more in $$.

That was also my intention and it paid off pretty well

Totally agree that BTC is a good way to earn money - but less good to pay for things (at the moment)

Thank you for your thoughts on this ��

I know for sure, that it id impossible to offer 100% price stability on a single good. When talking about price stability I think of "will I get the same value for my money tomorrow". Centralized currencies (€$£) have the ability due to their Institutions to act against recessions, high volatility etc, making buying goods on a daily basis (supermarket) safe (when was the last time your favorite milk changed its price).

Or maybe I just learn more than you by asking questions about things I am curious about

I get your point. And I also see big advantages in cryptocurrencies! At the time I just find it hard to believe that cryptocurrencies will be widely adopted and being used as a daily payment method!? There is no regulation regarding money supply/demand and therefore price stability, making it impossible to steer an economic unit.
