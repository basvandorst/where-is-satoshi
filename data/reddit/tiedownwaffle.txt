I replaced it after some syncing however when i did replace it and launched up the bitcoin core it did rescan

I downloaded bitcoin core. Its going to be a little to synchronize with the network. I assume I have to wait for that to finish to replace the wallet.dat file right?

putting the command listunspent yields nothing

I get this "Error: running with an unencrypted wallet, but walletpassphrase was called. (code -15)"

Hmm, I've gotten my bitcoin core to sync all the way to 2 years behind. I put in my wallet.dat and it took a while on rescanning after that finished the software still showed 0.000 btc I know i have some bitcoins on the wallet. What am i doing wrong?
