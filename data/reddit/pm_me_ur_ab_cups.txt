Besides leaving your BTC on an exchange, what other risks are there to margin lending?  From what little I know of margin trading, they can lose a lot, wouldn't that mean they may not be able to pay back the loan and interest?  Or is the the loan is always secured?

I don't mind the exchange aspect of it.  I'll have to look into it, as I figured there'd be more risk and that they only had to maintain a percentage before getting called.  Paying lenders before exchanges is nice, kind of unexpected.  Any exchanges preferred/trusted?

Yes, they support multiple coins, but unfortunately none support them all.  You can check the list of supported coins at each devices website, and most cover the big ones (BTC, ETH and the ERC20 coins, Litecoin, and a few others).  Depending on what you want to hold is how you'll have to make that decision.  If you diversify a lot or into smaller coins, you'll likely have to multiple wallets (not necessarily hardware).  Some coins have only their own wallets.

Diversify to the rescue again.

I can't explain in great detail, but a hardware wallet doesn't actually store coins.  The coins are on the blockchain, the ledger of all addresses/transactions.  The hardware wallet is just a convenient way to store/use the private keys that give you access to your coins.  
You gain access to the private keys by use of the seed words (12-24), which are easier to deal with then the private key string of characters would be (ex. 1x43kfdj3k249...).  These seed words in the correct order will always give access to the same addresses/private keys.  So even if you lose/break your hardware wallet, as long as you have the seed words you can still access your coins.  You can enter those seed words into a new hardware wallet, or any other wallet that uses the same protocols.

That's what I thought.  There would have to be other risks, otherwise everyone would do it.  Drops in prices are frequent and not always with warning, wonder how often lenders lose.

I was waiting for 8/1 FUD prices so sold some of my green alts a couple weeks ago, to buy back in lower. They dropped nicely, I took some time off and everything went back up some before 8/1, not fomoing back in yet. I see some info, but is there a good recap somewhere of what happened? And why do we still expect 8/1 FUD prices even though shit didn't hit the fan? Hoping so, so I can buy back in even lower.
