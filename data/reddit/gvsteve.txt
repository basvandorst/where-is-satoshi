They would have been able to pay more had they not had their economy ruined by hyperinflation. The hyperinflation via massive printing of debt money was counterproductive to both the economic well being of the Germans and the debtors. Edit: Partial evidence of this is how quickly the German economy grew after they suspended (and the stopped) the debt payments after hyperinflation made them impossible. 
Edit2: I really don't see what you're saying here. Are you saying the ability to hyperinflate was beneficial in Weimar Germany, or not? If it was beneficial, what advantage did it provide, considering it did not result in paying off the debt, and considering all the damage it caused?

It's surely not foolproof, and I hate to see Facebook become a requirement for anyone to do business at all, but I imagine it would be a little difficult to set up a fake facebook account with a good number of friends in the appropriate city, friends with numerous pictures tagged of the fake account's person in them, and a number of relatives with the same last name. . . It could be faked, but it would take more time and effort than photoshopping a driver's license scan.

The currency isn't destroyed, and the government has to find a better way of paying off the debt. Destroying the currency is not an effective means of paying off the debt anyway, especially a debt denominated in another currency. 
The quality of a currency should not be judged by its ability to pay off arbitrary amounts of debt without generating the wealth in the first place.
But by not destroying the currency the economy would function better, allowing the debt to be paid off sooner than if the currency was destroyed.

Of course it won't. If the market believes the value will increase in the future, the price of Bitcoin will go up, but it will hit limits where people who hoard (also called savers) decide to stop hoarding because their hoards are worth too much to them compared to the risk of the price falling.

None of which has anything to do with "full faith and credit"


Correct, so "full faith and credit" has nothing to do with the money supply, and so "full faith and credit" does not "back" the US dollar. The idea does not make any sense.

1) Bitcoin is analogous to a set of locked mailboxes with slots on them. The wallet.dat file is like having the keys to a certain number of those mailboxes. You need that key to get Bitcoins out of your mailbox. If you lose the wallet (key) your Bitcoins are lost forever. If you give anyone else your wallet (key) they can take your Bitcoins and move them somewhere where you can't use them.
Everyone in the neighborhood can check and see that you've got the right key to open that mailbox, but they can't see the key itself.
2) Yes, but be aware that spending money on one wallet will reduce the balance on both computers. Also, if you keep generating new addresses to receive Bitcoins on each computer, eventually you'll receive Bitcoins on one computer but not see them on the other computer. So it's not really advised.
3)Well, nothing has intrinsic value. But no, Bitcoin was never backed by any physical commodity. Some economists say that means it will never work, but the fact that it does have value right now makes the question of whether it can become valuable moot, imho.
4) Maybe. If computer storage grows faster than the Bitcoin blockchain, it won't be a problem. If it does, then common users can use special clients that don't need to download the entire blockchain (like the Android app BitcoinSpinner) and only the miners will have to have the entire blockchain. But you don't have to download that 14 hour part again, just from wherever you were the last time you connected. Usually just takes a minute or two if you connect every day.

The Bitcoin inflation rate was never that high.

The FDIC is explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the US government: 


So the US government will step in and refund any depositor if their bank can't repay their deposits. So what would it mean if the dollar was 'backed by the the full faith and credit of the US government'? What action is the US government legally bound to take to "back" the dollar?

Rather than a fee, a deposit would be a good idea for forums or wikis to screen out spam. Ask for people to send in, say, .1 BTC, and then refund it after a week or some period of time in which the person has demonstrated they are not dedicated to spamming. If they spam, keep the deposit. This would make it financially prohibitive for spammers but not cost real users more than a week's time value of the .1 BTC.

I don't think they could keep up a 51% attack for very long. And if they did, we could change the Bitcoin software to use a different type of hash that required a different type of hardware than what the attackers use. However there is a very good chance it would destroy the market cap of Bitcoin.

Why have no exchanges stepped up and made a way to short Bitcoins like Bitcoinica had?

The 51% attack does not involve mining blocks with no transactions - ~~unless you had 100% of the processing power there would still be others getting some blocks every once in a while. You would be able to slow down Bitcoin transactions and not stop them, and there is nothing special about 51% with this technique.~~
The (edit: the *typical*) 51% attack involves mining a second alternative blockchain in secret that you can generate faster than the main blockchain. In your alternative blockchain you don't include your own transactions. So, you buy a bunch of stuff with Bitcoins, take possession of your goods, then you broadcast your secret alternative blockchain which is accepted by all miners because it is longest, and which does not include your personal transactions. So you get your Bitcoins back and keep your stuff.

The difficulty change would adjust to keep roughly the same number of blocks per hour. So the number of blocks created would not change very much.  But with more hashing power than the rest of the network combined, you will, on average over time, generate more blocks than the rest of the network. So if you have your mining software reconfigured to generate new blocks only off of your self-generated old blocks you could make your own blockchain and exclude other people's transactions at will. (The Bitcoin software automatically assumes the longest blockchain, the 51% attacker's,  is the best and uses it.)

Mining with your CPU wastes energy and gives people false expectations.

If the number of requested transactions exceeds the max block size, only those transactions paying the highest fees will be included.

Well, it's complicated. If you have Bitcoin and want to spend it at business X, it is very helpful for the spender to have a BTC-for-giftcode websites compared to no acceptance at all. It doesn't increase public knowledge of Bitcoin as much as direct acceptance would. But economically, it is virtually the same. 99% of businesses of any considerable size, if they accept Bitcoin, they are going to sell any payments they receive for dollars immediately. That's functionally equivalent to what the BTC-for-giftcode sites do. And in my opinion, the gift code sites are just as convenient as direct acceptance.
The only real drawback is the middleman taking a fee.

I find it extremely hard to believe that nobody found them for that long, but then again the NSA has deep pockets and could buy off a lot of the world's best mathematicians.

You should then have referred to it as a period for 'system upgrades' or "maintenance" and not as a cool down period. 
'Cool down period' implies you decided to take action to alter the price of Bitcoin.

I'd like to know how many GH/s he mines. In terms of disclosure of his interests which may affect decisions he makes such as whether to increase the max block size.

Doesn't look like it.

Some people have a mortgage to pay and diapers to buy and can't gamble all their net worth on the future price of Bitcoin.

EBay would probably only allow Bitcoin use through their own PayPal-like service allowing for reversals and charging fees, if anything.

500GB/year might not be hardly anything in a couple years. Hard drives will continue to get bigger and cheaper.

Can you confirm for a fact that Satoshi is a single person, or is he a combination of several people trying to blur the blame/credit ?

Try to spend your Bitcoin and you have to pay transaction fees.

Well, they have to trace your address(es) to you and identify the owner(s) of the address(es) of whoever you are sending to.

Yes there is a way, you take a basket of goods like the CPI and chart its price change. This will not indicate that the dollar has fallen 50% in the last few month or so, as the dollar price of Bitcoin would have you think.

Imagine you had no Bitcoin holdings, and instead you had cash holdings in the amount of what your actual BTC holdings are worth. How much would you put into buying Bitcoin? This is the amount of BTC holdings you should have, and you should sell whatever is in excess of that. 
That is what I have been doing for months, and I don't regret it. Bitcoin is volatile as fuck, and you should not keep too high a percentage of your net worth in it.

I've never used the silk road, but if you had a GPG signature of a person you dealt with before you could verify it was the same person on the new site that you knew from SR.

There is little effective difference. I won't say most, but a lot of BTC merchants sell BTC for dollars on exchanges after each sale.

Why drug sales would have anything at all to do with homeland security is beyond me.

Is there a good secure alternative to Lavabit, preferably one based in a freedom-loving country?

Keep in mind though that the Bitcoin money supply is currently inflating at an annualized rate of 12.7%. Demand for Bitcoins must continue to grow at that rate just to keep the price of Bitcoin from dropping.

The FDIC does not insure the dollar either, only the dollars in insured bank accounts.
And there is certainly no guarantee that the value of the dollars they refund for your busted bank account will be worth anything close to what they used to.

If the FBI has 10,000 Bitcoins, people can send them multiple no-fee transactions of .00000001 Bitcoins that won't get confirmed. The FBI might see on their client that they have 10,000 confirmed Bitcoins and 10,000.00000074 unconfirmed Bitcoins, but they won't be able to spend the unconfirmed Bitcoin total. They will, however be able to spend 10,000 Bitcoins. So it doesn't do much unless the FBI is really dumb.

You've picked a few categories that are increasing in price mostly for other reasons - healthcare because of an aging population and regulation of services, gas because of scarcity and instability of sources, education because of supply limitations (accreditation) and government-sponsored student loans. Cars are constantly subjected to increased safety standards that increase the price.
If the value of the dollar was reducing at more than its normal expected rate, this should show up in the prices of nearly everything and not four cherrypicked categories.

It would require trust, but not very much more than it is required right now. SD can always just not pay out some large transaction's winnings.

Are you saying it is accurate that a greatly increasing Bitcoin price necessarily means currencies are inflating? Because if that's the case, then gold and silver are being greatly inflated as well.
