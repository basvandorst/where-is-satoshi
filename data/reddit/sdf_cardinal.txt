Not everyone who is adopting bitcoin believes that the Fed is inherently evil or that banks should be dissolved. Some of us believe they full bitcoin adoption will include integration of the currency into the current financial system.

I worked for a major newspaper in 2000 fresh out of college and during an all staff meeting the publisher told everyone that the internet was a fad. 
I noped my way into a career change real quickly.

He means it is the only thing it does regarding fdic limits. Stop being obtuse.

Why not just answer the question instead of sending people on scavenger hunts?

I kind of feel like that is exactly what he did by talking about this.

6.15 because isn’t much either. The trope here is that women like this are gold diggers, but they aren’t getting anywhere with someone with $60-70k. Try 300 btc.

Manipulating the price of gold (or any commodity or financial instrument) is one thing — OP is saying that in some instances there are dozens of buyers for some oz of gold owned on paper. That is what I’m arguing isn’t true. 
Do I think fraud exists? Wells Fargo and Goldman proves big banks can be bad actors at different fraudulent or unethical levels. But do I think they are faking gold instruments on a systemic scale?  No. I do not.

You keep saying this but it simply isn’t true. Each etf or other form of “paper” gold is actually backed by physical gold. 
Anything you can buy on a regulated exchange is real. Multiple people are not buying the same ounce. They just aren’t.

I wait. I just re read that. You are putting money in crypto before your 401k?
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:21:35
Bitcoin is yes, but the exchanges continue to be a problem. I guess if you think about how gold used to be robbed from trains and stage coaches and western banks... that is really where the exchanges are now: an unregulated Wild West.

Fraud exists. Racketeering exists. But if you want to believe that it exists on this level, ok. Gold futures are absolutely backed by actual gold; I don’t think I’m going to convince you otherwise. 
I agree with the other poster who suggested OP need to get off of the alternative, fear mongering conspiracy news — you should too.

Does your company match 401k? You don’t want to miss out on that free $ if they do.

I don’t know anyone in real life who actually thinks the economy is going to fail.

I’m not a trump voter/fan, but if anything the economy is doing great, even with the unexpected trade wars, etc.
If Trump proves anything to me, it proves how resilient our economy can be, even with unpredictable and reckless leadership.
