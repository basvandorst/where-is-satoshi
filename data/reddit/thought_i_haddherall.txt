:( 
Is this something that can change in the near future (as in they're currently working on licenses for these states) or not going to happen anytime soon (state rejected license application)?

So just say I transferred in my BTC from blockchain to something like bitfloor. **After** the 60 minutes you mention for the confirmation, (for trading) how long does a sell take to go through?
After I sell those coins, do I get the $ amount in return immediately into my bitfloor account? 
Am I able to buy coins with that money immediately ? And sell *those* coins instantly (or are there confirmation period in between these steps)?

Hell yes! It was aggravating to *me* how the host kept interrupting him and not allowing Jeff to get his point across and then kept misunderstanding (and thus) nitpicking. Jeff handled that really well. I would not have had the patience for it. 
I seriously thought he would just get up abruptly, look around until he found the active camera and then, while flash a big toothy grin, bitch-slap the host, and walk away. Its what I would have done, and that's not a good thing.
Mad props Jeff.
Edit: I also got a serious kick out of the fact that this financial show host did not know what a federal reserve note was. He sure was quick to jump on it, ready to attack.

Urgh... this is awful. I want to om nom nom all these coins as this price is going down!

Quick question here. Am I to understand that it is the nature of bitcoin that makes what you described above possible, or should one asumme that once a bitcoins is worth a million a piece that Ferraris and second condos would have shot up in price (USD or BTC) as well by then?
Edit: clarity

Ditto. No word from support 5 hours later. Sadly after bitfloor went down I must now settle for Coinbase :(

A *combination* of those, even, for now. Throw palm vein scanning into the fray as well maybe?!
Heck, possibly in the future once computing gets more powerful, person-specific DNA sequencing could be used to identify individuals. Link that to a wallet and BAM, that's **your** money. Verification only when genetic material sample is provided at moment of transfer/purchase/access?

Edit: Theoretically, what should one's next move be after this *(assuming a wallet was setup first)*?
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:56:03
Ah, but even if the DNA sample is provided first hand? Is there no way to determine the age of a sample to verify that?

Believe me I regret this now... I wish I could go back and slap the 'few months ago' me for thinking 'hey this looks like a reliable place to keep my coins... all my coins'
What is the private key :(? 
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:30:58
They definitely are not. I regret depending on them. I wish I could take my decision back. But bitcoins are a very *very* no take-backsies sort of thing.

My coins are in my Coinbase wallet which is very unfortunately on their server. I have tried creating second, third, fourth and fifth wallets both on sites and on my computer. The creating part works fine, Coinbase.com just wont confirm any transactions that involve withdrawing or selling.
I will try looking up my address on blockchain.info. Is there a possibility that someone may have stolen my coins? Even when they are secured in Coinbase?? I bet they won't hold themselves responsible in the event that something like that would happen, would they?

So I currently have my wallet on coinbase and leave the coins there for easy buying and selling. I am aware that the transfer between an on-pc wallet to the coinbase wallet should be very fast and it is also more secure in case coinbase goes down (and the bitcoin economy is fine).
- How likely is it for coinbase to take the plunge that some other trading sites have in the past (that I keep hearing of)?
- What would the repercussions in terms of rate be on bitcoin if coinbase does go poof?
- I want to have a secure offline wallet like you, how can I go about doing this? (I must clarify that the thought of being able to accidentally delete my file is scary which is why I opted to go through the online wallet, but I guess my reasoning is not at all sound. Are there any tutorials out there with not just step by step wallet creation but also wallet backup and safety? )
As of yet I am not interested in purchasing anything with the coins I am just going to be a dragon about them for a while and then eventually use them. So, I wont even be needing to send coins to addresses as it is at the moment. If i do get an offline wallet I will have to, and the thought of dyslexic, clutzic, me accidentally paying for someones porsche or vacation is not just horrifying but also seems very possible (in my shoes). Are there any tips or tools to help with this as well?

How does one utilize, or start to look at how to utilize, these bots?
