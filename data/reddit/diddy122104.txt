I love and appreciate your sympothy, I do. But please understand. I have no regrets, and my post was aimed to show that. It was never an investment to me. Don't get me wrong, I like money, but Dogecoin goes to the moon, Bitcoin liberates us as humans.

No, the dread pirate Roberts was the famous username of Ross Ulbricht. I'm sorry for the confusion, I just expect people to know about information from back in 2012. My mistake. Especially with the sensory overload the media produces these days. That being said, there are most definitely people at the top that make millions of dollars off the people at the bottom,  which is "the man" I was referring to.
Edit: grammar.

I have a profitable business with employees. I even accept bitcoin as payment! Oddly enough, I used 2 Bitcoin to buy an eBay gift card to start my business! We do good, and we give to the community. I'm in the process of starting a cab company with eco friendly cabs. Which means I can charge half the rate, and pay my new employees (I have 12 employees for the cab company now) twice as much.
Edit, fat fingers.

"Crypto is like a space craft that one could use to explore the universe for long-term benefits for humanity, but instead people decided to use it to get rich selling Earth-Moon travel tickets."
This was my point.
The current sentiment would prove you right, but when I got in to bitcoin, I bought it as a donation because I believed in the cause. I never thought it would go up, I thought it would die before anybody knew what it was.

The loss of coins was the fun part. The bad investments were horrid, but not the biggest loss. Invested in some dead end alts. Cryptsy got me for quite a few coins, and their "mining contracts". But I spent quite a few, and tipped lots. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:40:42
And then there is that. I accept bitcoin as well. I have never had a bitcoin customer tell me they never received a package even though the tracking says otherwise. That being said, I'm sure there is a lot of retail scammers trying to steal people's money, but from my view, it's mostly the buyers. There is nothing wrong with using a 3rd party if you feel insecure!

I used this example because it happened to me. There was a guy in Taiwan in 2011 that wanted to start up a prosthetics company. The only way was western union. I tried to send him 4 grand but western union locked the funds. I had to fight with them for 3 weeks to get my money back, and I havent tried to send paper money internationaly since.

When I cashed out the 5 Bitcoin in 2013 there wasn't a tax standard for Bitcoin. In 2014 and 2015 I claimed it as income, and last year I claimed capital gain.

We had paypal for a while. It seemed like nobody signed up and used the actual paypal system while we used it. We get about 60 sales a day and I think over the course of 3 months we only had about 10 actual paypal purchases. most people use "checkout as guest". Which is essentially the same thing as a regular credit card processor.
So I agree with you, nobody uses "paypal" per-se outside of ebay. But paypal does function like a credit card processor as well, and people used that a lot, not even knowing most of the time.

Great analogy! I personally think the government should have bailed out the people who owed the bank, and let the bank struggle to survive.

I can't speak for u/cryptohazard but Bitcoin would need to go down a lot for me to be in the red. I hope you didn't invest a lot if you are losing, and if so, I hope your luck changes for you and your family.

I think it might actually be 3.8%. Plus I think a $0.20 fee per transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:00:56
As long as "it'll still be about money." Means "A healthier economic system, with less chances to put decent people out on the streets because banks are giving outrageous loans to people they know can't afford them so they can artificially inflate their businesses." Then I fully agree. Investing in bitcoin is investing in your future, and the future generations we hand the torch to.

I love your dark views on my life. I actually stopped smoking weed after I graduated college, I have a business that supports me and my 3 kids, and im in my late 20s. I bought my initial business startup with bitcoin, but I didn't want to include that because I thought it was taking things to far. I own my house (no mortgage) and I owe 3k on my 2017 Mitsubishi outlander (mom car) and my wife is sexy. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:03:05
But I had a lot of fun!!! I can't express enough how bitcoin was never meant to be a retirement. It wasn't supposed to be "wait till it gets high and trade it back to paper money". Good job increasing your portfolio though! I hope it continues to help you meet whatever goals you have set for it!
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:59:57
I'll agree forced is a bit strong. But out monetary system is what I was raised in. If I want basic freedoms, like having children and being married to the one I love, there isn't much I can do without it. I'm sure there are loopholes, and the word "forced" could be ripped apart. But it looks like 99% understood what I have to say, so I'm going to give myself a pass on the particulars.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:41:47
Thats kinda what I was saying. It wasnt money management, because it wasn't about money. I didn't buy bitcoin for the investment because nobody thought it was going up.
Btw, by the time I traded for some Dogecoin BTC was in the $300s. Also, I didn't lose it buying weed, I spent it ��. I probably tipped over 30mil in Dogecoin, I don't consider that a waste "per say". I own a profitable business so after I got my money back, it was just play.

I wasn't talking about pirates. I was talking about a username. And there surely is a "the man", he controls your healthcare, your college loans "unless you had money to do without." And he controls your media. 
I like the way you think though, you definitely have a "the world is what you make it" view, which is better than a lot of people. Keep keeping it real man!
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:31:04
I like your stance on investment, but I think you missed my point. I don't care if bitcoin goes up. We have already changed the world, and anybody that bought bitcoin invested in the protest to try and change the world. Even if it fails. Each bitcoin represents 1 "fun ticket" to show our government we aren't happy.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:20:29

Are you retarded? Saying Bcash is nothing like saying the N word. Are you really implying that Bcash is even remotely as offensive? You need to talk to a black man and tell him that calling a cryptocurrency by the wrong name is  even a smudge on his dick in comparison to the way nigger was used against slaves for almost 400 years.

I've been through a few. Currently we are considered "high risk" and 3.8% is great. We had some chargebacks due to stolen cards so now we are considered high risk. No chargeback with BTC though!!!
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:43:40
"Grossly misinformed" hurts a bit. I can't see where my information is flawed even in the context of your comment. That being said, we can agree to disagree on whether our government did the right thing. Although your comment seemed overly critical, I respect your position.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:44:27
I never told anyone to calm down. I never asked for anything. If someone was in danger of losing there money, they should not have bought Bitcoin. Bitcoin can save us from our government, but nothing can save us from ourselves.
I have faith in Bitcoin, so I'm keeping my coin. If faith is not present, then it should be sold, or better yet, never purchased. 
Remind me! 3 months

Unfortunately that is the cost of running an online business. They don't send money, they ach deposit. I would love to deal in cash.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:38:41
You know, everybody talks about the consumer. I mean, I own an online business and I sell physical goods. It cost me 3%  per transaction to have a customer pay with credit card. So if they spend $500 I pay $15. Not only that, but it takes 3 days to get to me. Credit card -&gt; my processor -&gt; my bank account. I'll tell you, I never bought BTC. But I'm holding everything I don't need to sell for more product, because bitcoin has been a blessing to me and my family.  
Edit: forgot to mention, I don't need to worry about chargeback with BTC. So I save an extra $300-$500 monthly.

I have used coingate for a while now. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that withdrawals have to be manually approved. This looks shady because it Is unnecessary. I mean, what is a situation in which you wouldnt approve the withdraw? If its my money, its my money right? There shouldnt be a situation that you dont give someone there money, so it should be automatic right? Also, there is no way to change the fee. Last month it took almost 2 weeks to get my withdrawal because the fee wasn't enough.
Besides those 2 problems, coingate rocks. Never had an issue. Over 5k in sales so far.

Some people dont see it. But bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) is going to be a world currency. All large settlements will be transferred through digital currencies, and only 3rd world countries will have fiat, because there government will make them. Interesting times. Bitcoin has just started, and these people talking about it negatively are scared, and rationalizing there own opinions most likely due to there position. Let them resist bitcoin all they want, they will eventually be looked at like people who live off the land. Go back to there old "government notes". Anyone who owns bitcoin is part of a movement to a greater future, and those who are not, are people scared of it. My dad resisted smartphones until winter 2016, now he loves his GPS and music while he rides his motorcycle with his "brothers". He resisted because he didn't understand it's capabilities. Enjoy being a part of this future, and fuck the investors and there little money hungry minds.

Ha, you investors and your little opinions. Bitcoin ( or some other digital note) is the future. Do you think we will be using paper dollars in 100 years? Bitcoin isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and until a More established crypto currency comes out Bitcoin won't drop sub $2000. Hodl or Fodl investor man.
