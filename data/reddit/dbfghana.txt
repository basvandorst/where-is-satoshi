Western union charges a fee of 12% and over  on every transaction, and also if the rate is $1 to Ghs4.2, western union and moneygram can gave a rate of 1$ to Ghs3.4 which amounts to stealing from their customers but it differ from BtcGhana platform as we use an online to calculate the rate for the cuatomers thereby we have major advantages over them, and also the recipient will be receiving their money on their phone via Mobile money system here, thereby the customer can cashout his money anytime whether saturday or sunday. no need of waiting on banking hours before you can cashout your money as being done by Western union and moneygram

Most of the young entrepreneurs in Kumasi here has been mentored on how they could lock their bitcoin with any of the major currencies and most of the potential commodities like Gold and silver. In this way Bitcoin can be classified as a currency and commodity.

Mobile Money is a cash management service available via mobile phone or the internet, and is mainly about facilitating money transfer for the Ghanaian market. The service can also be used for reloading of airtime units, and for payment of utility bills, goods &amp; services. The service is available to both mobile and non-mobile users.

The digital currency, Bitcoin, could be an alternative to mobile phone payment systems in Ghana, such as MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money or Tigocash. 
Bitcoins have several advantages over mobile money. They can be traded across international borders, while mobile payment systems are limited to money transfers within the country and you are also obliged to keep Ghc10000 as the maximum fund you can save in your wallet but Bitcoin is opposite to it as you can save any amount of money equivalent to Bitcoins in your wallet. Additionally, those transactions typically take seconds to complete.

Yeah, we had a wonderful seminar in Ghana last year
