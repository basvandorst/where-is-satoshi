Your plan makes sense. It’s well thought out. 
One of my Texas clients said he buys when he is stick to his stomach and he sells when he thinks he’s taller, better looking and richer then he is. A cab driver joined a conversation my friend and I were having about stocks. He owned some great winners from the 1970’s. A&amp;P, Chrysler, Con Edison were some of the names he mentioned.
Diversity of your investment portfolio is very important.

There is a lot going on. In both ICOs and blockchain.

Bitcoin, bubble. It’s all about crowd psychology.
If you want to read about people’s thoughts as that what prices these assets the following books Wikipedia link will share an overview of how bubbles have happened over time.
Market prices do fluctuate. In my lifetimes I’ve seen real estate and financial assets prices fall dramatically and then regain their losses and some even continue to rise.
Prices fall when there are more sellers then buyers. Prices fall faster then they rise.
What will make trading easier, faster and cheaper is when the futures/options markets allow for seamless arbitrage.

There have been financial bubbles throughout history. The Dutch has tulip bulb mania. Fortunes were lost. 
This is an excellent book 
Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds is an early study of crowd psychology by Scottish journalist Charles Mackay, first published in 1841.
In capitalist economics some prices are determined by markets. Markets fluctuate. Markets go down quicker then they go up.
Once the clearing process for bitcoin futures takes the same time as other financial instruments you will see more fluctuation in price, both up and down, and greater increased trading volume.
Unless you can handle price swings you shouldn’t buy. It’s still a very small market as markets go.
No one knows the future of price of bitcoin. 
If you want to learn about crowd human behavior in financial markets read the book I mentioned at the beginning of this post.

When corporations buy their stock it gets retired.  Corporations buy back shares to increase their earnings per share.
The board of directors control the Company as they oversee managements results.

Is there a website or source which lists and compares fees and clearance times to buy and sell bitcoin or other ICOs.
When they straighten it out. And who they is I don’t know. Trading should work like trading works now. Confirmations near time after trade execution. Settlements within a few days after.

We are talking about crowd psychology in financial markets. What all bubbles have is people who think it’s a overpriced and people who see it as an opportunity to buy. People were making money in Holland when they sold their tulips until they weren’t. The only thing I know about ICOs is that some will increase in value and some will not. Their scarcity and the problem they solve will determine future value.
