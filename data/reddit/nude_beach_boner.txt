What was edited? Looks the same to me.

The winner could cut a deal with finex,  they are the ones who press charges after all.

If it is him, his encryption is encrypted. Very doubtful the government would get his coins.

I may be mistaken,  but none of the US exchanges offer any leverage at all right? 
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:56:12
How do you do that? My employer only offers set plans (that I know of) and they aren't bitcoin related. I'm in a similar poison where I have substantial 401k funds that need BTC exposure.

Thank you!

Under what authority could they seize his coins (assuming he's Satoshi)? It doesn't sound like he has done anything wrong and if he didn't sell then there were no capital gains.
@_date: 2015-12-09 01:20:26
classic Satoshi

Those emoticons got really out of hand

Exactly!

Remember the LTC whale in BTC-e last year? He had 300k LTC and the same thing happened then. People run from the wall but people eventually eat the wall.

Why would stamp gox their customer? Especially such a profitable one?

I panic rentered at $312. We'll see how that goes.

Did you think this would work?

I read that whole thing.  Fucking eerie man.  
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:51:46
Me too. It's a *coin* tose what's going to happen next.

BTCC literally just puts huge orders into the the past trades. They don't even try to hide it. Buy yeah, they all do it.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:42:03
how do you know it's a pooled account? I know they offer it, but where do you see that this  account was pooled?

The chinese don't use stop losses much. Whalecalls on twitter always has a bunch of rekt bodies.

Goldeneye 007. Well done sir.

You have coins from 2009 that you haven't moved?
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:31:59
Coinbase Exchange.

Mark bought Mt gox from mcJeb i think.

His legendary status has never been in doubt, just kinda of odd not to move coins in 6 years. I've only been here since early 2013 and I've moved my coins a lot.
@_date: 2015-08-05 01:45:15
looks like it ended. nevermind.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:40:55
Only $6m in longs got called. I honestly thought it would be like $10-20m given this volume.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:44:29
that was in october 2013. the 1200 pump was about 1.5 months later.
Edit: yes, downvote a verifiable truth.
@_date: 2015-08-21 01:10:31
The second a big block is mined, the price will crash due to the uncertainty. Not saying it's rational, but it will happen.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:39:51
people couldn't get fiat out of gox starting in june 2013. why would it stay is the 100s for 6 months before pumping?
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:43:14
BFX was stable at 250, 30 minutes of total pump/dump fuckery, now steady at 230. *takes toke* fuckin bitcoin man
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:29:24


LTC dumped and immediately BTC pumped. The profit from LTC went straight into BTC.

The miners are getting 25 coins per block,  plus like 0.25 in transaction fees. That 0.25 are the fees they're collecting. Nowhere near 1mil per day. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:21:18
The price of bitcoin in fiat has remained fairly stable recently.  Therefore,  supply is meeting demand. The bitcoin community is not losing 1mil per day. The bitcoin market cap is increasing by 1 mil per day. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:44:29
Dude,  we're talking about transaction fees here which is nowhere near 1mil per day. The coins aren't costing anybody anything since the price isn't decreasing versus fiat.  What don't you understand about that?

Comfirmed. Andreas is SN 
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:51:51
$414 doesn't seem right. 1.1m BTC would decimate the price if it was a market sell.
