HODL? Not me....I'm buying! I know how I want my portfolio to balance and I'm slowly getting there but I'm not selling anything!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:26:31
Sell??? I'm looking to buy more! It's on sale right now!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:51:16
Hell yeah!!

Not quite 17 but kind of.....
In 2016 I bought $25 of Bitcoin purely because a friend said it would grow. Promptly forgot about it. 
3 months ago I joined Reddit and saw how BTC had grown. Decided to check on my $25 and found it was now $110. Spent the rest of the week kicking my own ass as I should have bought more than $25 in 16....
Since then I've spent / invested $100 per fortnight into BTC, LTC, BCH (from the fork), ETC and most recently Ripple. I'd pump more in however my income is now very limited. However my current portfolio is worth roughly  10 times what I started with in 2017. My input has been $720 so far for this year. I'm working on Dollar Cost Averaging rather than trading as I don't have the knowledge for trading and probably not the interest or commitment.
Just really wish I'd bought several coins last year before I got sick.....

It depends on your investment strategy and investment risk profile. Long term and medium to high risk - hold and use dollar cost averaging to increase. Short term, low risk - why would you invest in crypto. Choose cash or bonds.
Investment for the future is all about knowing what you want to accomplish and choosing the appropriate financial vehicle to achieve it. 
I'm 48 and crypto is only a small part of the vehicles I've chosen. However I'm also looking long term (7 years or more in investment terms) and have a high risk investment profile. Crypto fits nicely and I won't be selling any time soon.

I suddenly feel right at home lol
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:47:48
Fuck yeah! Every. Single. Time!

Frantically saving fiat to buy more Bitcoin as well as keeping my dollar cost averaging system in place.......
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:00:57
And it worked? That's awesome! Well done!
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:03:03
My position: if it goes up, HODL and BUY, if it goes down HODL and BUY. 
Early adopters stage - we're still in it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:19:06
Ok noob here. Just started. Wish I had more cash to buy more! Bitcoin, Litecoin and a dozen others!
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:50:39
How do you recover it?
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:58:09
Different question - how do you protect your profits (if you call them that) in the case of a "correction"?
So far my strategy has been this - price falls, buy more! However I'm only a small time and very new with not a lot to lose).

Awww shit.....my lambo will have to be the LM002....
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:29:20
Excellent! Best way to buy :)

Weekly. It's called dollar cost averaging (google it) ;)
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:04:45
Thanks! I'm on an unlimited plan but that's very handy to know :)

Bitcoin Core is 0.15.1
Port forwarding is enabled and can be seen from outside the Lan. 
SSH shows a connection via port 8333 however I'm not running telnet on that system (Windows 7).
 shows the port is open as well.
I'm thinking it's the bitnodes.earn.com website that has the issue as Bitcoin Core is currently showing 29 connections.

Loving it!
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:17:03
Thanks dude! I'll give that a try :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:03:44
Thanks for the response! That's excellent. Looks like I'll be building a full node :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:15:04
Thanks. I think I'll stay HODLing. Happy to accept some risk but trading sounds like more risk than I'm willing to accept.

Depends on your goals. My goals are long term. I don't check every day or every week. I just buy more of the coins I've chose. I'm not even remotely interested in trading.
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:55:07
Bwhahahahahaha "just get robbed by the govt".....happens every. day. of. the. week. I'm afraid this is nothing new just coming from a direction.

Great post! I just completed my second purchase working on Dollar Cost Averaging. Long term plan of 15-20 years investment with fortnightly purchases. BTC tho is only part of the overall investment plan tho.

Surprised these types of "laws" have not come into play in Australia......yet.
