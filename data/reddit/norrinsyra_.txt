"As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade."

besides, i couldn't put bcash in the title due to it being an altcoin.  let's not focus too much on "first fork".  facts are facts, bcash is down 90%, and has no commits practically esp in comparison to bitcoin.  those are the facts to focus on.  you can nitpick small time stuff all you want but you do you bro!
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:45:03
