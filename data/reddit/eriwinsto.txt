Nobody's gonna point a gun at you for not paying taxes. They're going to give you due process (which you are not paying for, by the way), and put you in jail. 
And total anarcho-capitalism (which, I *think*, is what you're describing) ignores economic externalities. Say I don't pay for the fire department, and my house burns to the ground. I don't give a shit, I have insurance. The four neighbors whose houses caught fire when I made the rational decision to let my house burn down are left holding the bag for something that was absolutely not their fault. 
Another example: I'm a parent. I live in poverty. I don't care whether my kid gets an education--it's too expensive. My kid doesn't get to go to school and can't find a high-paying job. So he's poor. His kids don't get to go to school. Their kids are poor. That doesn't sound like utopia, that sounds like Industrial Revolution-era England.

We have a progressive tax system. That's a fact--the rich are taxed more than the poor, which is the definition of a progressive tax system. 
Edit: also, taxes go towards roads, schools, National Parks, police, fire departments, the National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, food stamps, and about a zillion other good things. Maybe they're not all perfect, but we pay taxes so those things can keep existing.

But not as big as we hope it is.

There's a name for that--money laundering. If BTC becomes a viable currency, say goodbye to tumblers.

How did you reconstruct it in R? I'm taking a class in R right now and that's a fascinating idea.

The Feds can hire whoever they want. What's to say they don't have people working on their own altcoin already? I bet there's another Satoshi out there and all the Fed needs to do is hire some genius math-CS-double major out of college. Look at what they've accomplished with defense tech. If there's one source of funding that will get altcoins adopted, it's the USFG.

I love the archaic usage of the word "heathen."

Oh I gotcha. I was pretty confused.

I'm new to the bitcoin community, and I share the OP's concerns. For me, buying BTC is more like buying equity in the short-term future of bitcoin. 
I just don't think it has enough advantages to everyday people over the dollar. I'd love to be wrong, but I just feel like it doesn't offer a whole lot more to Joe Schmo.
