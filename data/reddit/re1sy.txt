@_date: 2017-12-31 11:44:23
 Betta get my portfolio locked and loaded by then

Libertarianism is a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:50:31
I predict a BCH dump then BTC hitting 20k
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:43:26
Ahh good so I better count my losses as well because those offset my gains, say btc drops before I purchase the alt coin
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:20:06
So much this.  Lol, they've been doing it all day today.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:21:32
Unless you plan on riding it back up and then some.  FTFY
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:46:05
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:17
What's your move?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:27
Looks like all sells have stalled out.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:49:20
l could use that bull trap then
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:42
BCH was blowing up all day then boom coinbase adds it.  Alot of people knew and those people made money.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:46:37
Im actually planning on doing the same now.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:45
I mean I bought BTC for an alt coin earlier then was going to wait for the price to recover, looks like those coins suffered worse so at least I didn't loose as much as I could of. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:42:21
Once coinbase releases everyone's BCH they were holding it will be crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:45:46
It will bounce back, especially after christmas.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:40:00
Its true in SK, korbit exchange for example, BTC stayed around 19k.
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:46:04
It wasn't that i held onto it, it was that the mining pool took around a year to pay me haha! 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:31:47
Yeah tbh I did it just for fun.  I forgot I had even mined.  Hmm I think i was going through the ledger online (you can just type in address and it shows if there's been actively) just to see if I had left some crumbs in old accounts and had seen that I had been sent money just like a week prior.  
Tbh I'm interested in which made more my win10 gaming PC or older linux machine that I left one way longer.  I've yet to even look at that, I need too haha. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:09:57
This wasn't any major source of income but I was mining eth a few years ago and by the time the mining pool sent me my share it was well worth it.  (i was mining on a gaming PC which I still use) Heck I've yet to even dig up some eth off of a linux machine I have but I think I'll wait till it recovers anyway.  XD
Yeah it may be a complete waste if you choose a random altcoin- but I wasn't mining ether by accident.  Always do your research and know your use cases.  
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:45:24
you die and you leave your wallet info in your will for your son who will spend your fortune purchasing a moderate sized island forming a nation/state, naming its capital after you.  
maybe i should go to bed now.  
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:05:41
Would you like a loan to pay off that debt?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:33:00
I mean I don't feel bad.  He could of just gone right back and bought more.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:34:52
Thank you for all the tips! Glad you got your house payed off.  Really what more do we need.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:06:11
AMEN BROTHER
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:01:03
What's going down when with the litecoin halvening?  I mean I could google, but yeah what's up?
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:47:28
Yes, pics or it didn't happen! 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:30:13
Does that mean anything for people holding LTC?
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:58:25
Quick question, do those tax losses have to be realized within the same year (or tax period)?
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:04:35
4th, but who's counting?
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:33:58
Were they being payed directly or were those individuals just profiting off ad revenue from views?
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:30:52
So are you basically saying you have a 50/50 chance to make a ton of money when that happens?
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:34:29
reading that made me nervous and i don't even have btc at the moment lol.
