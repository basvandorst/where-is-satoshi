I hope most people can get out with their money intact...

When you are bought up with national education wired in your mind (like hostility against Japan, etc), you won't care.

People are mining with specialized machines that don't resemble a pc at all. Your pc sounds really powerful but I don't think it will work unless it is a supercomputer.

The problem here is that you can follow through on the joke of funding ISIS by sending them penny shavings over the Internet and get caught.

Quick brief translation!
"You can use Coinkite for all your Bitcoin Wallet needs.
Let me know any mistakes I make because this message is computer-translated."

It does look strange to promote BTC and not accept it. 
"Use Bitcoin! Bitcoin not accepted here."
BTW did you capitalize EDgy with special meaning?
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:56:56
Such a dirty blow! Relying on sabotage instead of honest competition.

I would like to pay for games subscriptions and currencies with Bitcoin. But I think it is too much to make Bitcoin the only currency in an existing game, that would turn games into Chinese pay-to-win shopfest....
There are also player scams! Tying a game directly into Bitcoin is too dangerous.

Beauty is subjective or in the eye of the beholder or something,but we still have to try :D 
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:15:17
Oh thanks &lt;3
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:46:41
It is a little awkward but the meaning is pretty hard to misunderstand. But my English is not so good either =v=

Interesting. You should post it on CryptoCurrency or some another subreddits, where people aren't 100% interested in Bitcoin but are likely to?
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:49:12
True! And even if it is just a cent they still have to make an example of them :3
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:14:36
Yeah, just like a grocery shop can refuse to sell alcohol to a known pyromaniac. Why is that so hard to understand o.o

So? It is not the fault of the currency that malware exists.

Was hoping for some thrilling conspiracy and high speed chase scene

Just make it opt-in for interested artist?

Perhaps, they should ask for tips from their userbase into a wallet for UI design?? If there are a lot of happy users it will adds up.

If someone says Bitcoin is useless, prove them wrong and anyone else that happens to read it will also learn about Bitcoin and its use instead of just looking at internet drama.
@_date: 2015-03-14 14:03:48
Just buy and hold a little coin or do faucets I think .3. Take the free time to relax.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:38:44
Every little bits help! (Pun not intended)

I don't know enough about other truly different altcoins like Ripple or Etherum to comment on them, but these altcoin clones that are just reskinned bitcoin with different settings I just don't understand what is the point of trading or buying them o.o

It is better to learn both, I live there and Mandarin is kind of like a second/third language to a native that are so similar yet so different to Cantonese.
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:19:12
Because it is nice to have people accept BTC???
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:32:27
I guess I will have to read up and research then. Any common error to notice? Should I put down a list of common wallets like Coinbase or Blockchain? Or tell people to come over to reddit ? Or should I not do these thing? I think I am too young to speak well and I am not good at writing long text too and I don't want to like burn bridges when people can do it better than me...
I meant I am at a loss with the technical things so should I just keep it really brief like a nudge or should I drop them a guide from elsewhere?? Definitely not feel confidently enough to type up one on my own but I still want to tell people about it x.x
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:20:07
I probably should try that. Any advice xD?
