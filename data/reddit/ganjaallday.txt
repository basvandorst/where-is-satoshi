Who didn’t pray last night
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:07:06
I keep my coins on binance.. is this bad? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:12:47
I don't understand the negativity, don't we all want bitcoin to skyrocket again?
Even if he turns out wrong, we should still be happy.
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:44:23
Someone else that bought high! Not alone at last
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:55:49
sorry for not knowing as much as you man, your dick must be giant
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:20:42
Only if you’re a hodler
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:52:32
Why are you even here lol
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:06:03
You talk too much
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:05:19
That’s not what I meant, i could’ve phrased it better 
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:50:40
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:54:42
Lol, you sold and you’re here to make sure it crashes to make you feel better
Absolutely pathetic
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:55:13
you can but its of course risky, hodling seems to be the way to go
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:05:48
So what’s the plan boys
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:02:15

@_date: 2018-05-24 12:16:49
$6300, damn I hope it’s not all your savings!
Although if, sorry when, it skyrockets, we’ll all be jealous ;) 
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:14:24
Everyone always posting about how it’s “good” we’re dropping so that we can buy..
Okay but at one point we need to skyrocket so we can actually see gains.. 
Let’s not sugarcoat it, it’s not looking good.
@_date: 2019-03-30 00:54:59
If we break $4,200, i’d say bullrun confirmed and coming soon. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:10:32
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:07:18
Who shat in your breakfast 
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:46:58
Obviously people will be bias here but objectively it’s still a yes. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:13:03
I know, lol
@_date: 2019-03-21 00:18:45
Did creator actually bail?
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:10:37
You’re right, it’ll jump it and hit 100k directly. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:25:06
So like, are we all fucked and becoming homeless?
@_date: 2019-03-21 18:15:14

@_date: 2018-06-10 20:47:10
Being homeless won’t be so bad
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:39:26
I invested a good amount of my savings but I’d be fine without it. I’m already down so much that it’d make sense for me to just ride it out and hope for the best, if i lose it all then that’s that :/ 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:03:57
Wow we fuckin suck
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:20:33

Hey man, OP is just showing some hope for us. This subreddit has been extremely negative for months.
If we don’t have hope, what do we have?
@_date: 2018-11-09 13:02:32

@_date: 2018-11-29 04:39:52
;-( feels
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:53:25
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:42:00
I still have hope!
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:27:42
There won’t always be a definite reason as to why it would increase
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:42:01
People lose hope so quick lol 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:00:46
We ain’t going down without a fight
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:00:33

Yea i bought at 17k and have been hodling ever since :( 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:05:17
Literally all i see in this subreddit is to HODL till death, who said to sell? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:39:56
