What is that computer you are using?

Sure but I would be on the safe side and use 10-12 words taken from a equal distribution from a big pool of words. If you take a random English word its 65% chance that it will be one of the 300 most common words. That only give you about 9 bits of entropy per word. Sure you can just a few extra words to make up for it but you could also be unlucky and its not the proper thing to do. I would like at least 100 bits of entropy. In your example you could be unlucky and have about 40 bits in a bad case.

I don't like the XKCD compic strip because it give to weak security for bitcoin.  Its more meant for online site where you cant have hundreds of billions of guesses a second to a private key.
Do not take random word from wikipedia article or any other article or poem etc for that matter . They have an distribution that an attacker can use.
If you don't know exactly what you are doing, don't trust yourself to make a password for your wallet.

They will be seen as forerunners by the new "Internet generation". They will get the best kind of free advertising to these people. Remind them that it can be converted to usd at anytime for a low fee.

The attack sounds a lot like one family poisons the villages only water well just to steal a few nickels. This probably not a sound strategy for anyone in the long run.

...and then pay with bitcoins.
