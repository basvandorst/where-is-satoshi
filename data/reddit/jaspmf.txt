It isn't DOA, it's there incase the majority ever decides it's needed. Just sitting on the shelf, which is great. It's wonderful that the option is there and ready to go.
It'd be nice if a lot of proposals were such...just a consensus flag away from activation. 
Seems perfect to me, sort of a last resort if necessary.

Satoshi, Satoshi should pay dev's.
Having such a huge portion of total BTC it's a no-brainer, the few million (dollars) he could spend a year would absolutely increase the value of his stash by many factors more.

Which highlights the crux problem with a deflationary currency. Don't spend it cos it'll be worth 10x in the future!
The world could use a bit of savings though, and inflation is probably why nobody does save.

It's a currency now, and eventually it will a base settlement layer of a currency.
Works fine for me when I pay for things with it. Not sure how it isn't a currency, that's how I use it.

Moore's law is the only thing that has died more times than Bitcoin.
I've been reading articles for years about how "Moore's law is finally coming to an end" or "14nm, atoms are just too small...say goodbye to Moore's law."
Without fail someone invents some new monolithic architecture or some crazy thing from left field and guess what, Moore's law fades death again.

It doesn't matter what it was "promoted as." What matters is what the protocol is good at, what it is bad at, and what it truly excels at. It really doesn't make sense to have the insane security of BTC (which is necessarily a bit slow as a tradeoff for being highly secure/distributed-decentralized) for a bunch of micro transactions. The cost/benefit makes no sense.
I agree with the devs in respect to aiming for a base settlement layer as BTC and integrating a different protocol to handle huge quantities of TX/sec that periodically settles with BTC. Can BTC ever handle hundreds of thousands of transactions/sec? Could it be cost effective at doing so? No. Seems like alot of people don't respect the limitations or inherent tradeoffs should we decide to move the limitations of the protocol

If you're interested in trade analysis and such, try Personally I'd sold everything around 450-460 awhile back awaiting the blocksizelimit debate to get worked out. Watched this tank patiently awaiting a bounce and bought in 100% again in the 360's.
Classic looks to have plenty of momentum, and it literally just today seemed to signal as such. Which would have been a buy signal to me at 460 even :) Amazing that it coincides with such a dump. Thanks Mike! Thanks NYT!

I think it's rather wise of coinbase to hedge their bets by running multiple implementations. You'd be in a real pickle if they weren't forward thinking when it comes to fork time...which seems quite plausible. Several of the big miners just came out in favor of classic.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:44:43
The only time that a problem may arise is when making transactions during the fork. If you're just holding your coins nothing to worry about. All the past history is still there, along with your sweet sweet coins.

Yeah, side chains are dank. Esp when they check into the mainchain now and again to "settle up". The whole anti-sidechain anti-LN thing is ridonkulous. Bitcoin is AMAZING at some things and not so amazing at others, let it do what its best at and do it perfectly...let other protocols specialize at what they do

Is there a tangible reason why the reward just instantaneously cuts in half instead of incrementally decreasing over time? Obviously Satoshi made this decision...I wonder what the reasoning was.
I understand markets are forward looking, and should technically factor this in...but I can't help but wonder if it would have been a more stable to have a constantly diminishing block reward, economically speaking that is.

I agree, build the network in layers. Of course it can't scale forever...I'd prefer see it's scaling naturally cap itself based on a market mechanism as opposed to arbitrarily deciding a cap.

That's a pretty good argument, thanks for taking the time to clarify your position.
However those were capped at the beginning, when some arbitrary number needed to be decided. Having inflation dwindle is a great policy, it isn't necessarily market based...but it is known from outset. Inflation tapering off is a characteristic of bitcoin. I wouldn't say the same for an artificial cap on tx quantity. I understand that there is some finite amt of tx that can occur, but nobody mentioned that when they defined BTC.  
I don't see how artificially capping the ability to move funds is good for the user. I see where coin limit is good for the user (you can hold value w/o watching it vanish). I see how coin distro is necessary (idk how else you'd do it but reward early adopters and their "work") I just can't fathom how intentionally bottlenecking the liquidity of funds is advantageous for the users. Sure it can be done, but what's the value in it economically speaking?
Also, to clarify..I believe sidechains are necessarily the future, I'm all for BTC as base-settlement layer only. I get where its advantages lie and understand that there are obvious real limits to how many tx's can reasonably happen. Nobody should be using it for coffee purchases, that's a waste.

Amazing stuff. 
Anonymous seemingly unpublished Crypto patents/copyrights that are indisputable. 
So if it's something like say an mp3 or video (not just words) could you just timestamp an md5 checksum or something like that to verify proof of existence prior to block mined time?
