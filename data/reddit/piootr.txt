If these 2000 coins were whale's short entry we may see a good dip. Hope last one.

Thank you for explanation. 
But how do I know what was removed? "promoting an altcoin" can be subjective.
I think it can only work in a way like hiding comment's content with option to see it.
Don't you think that one of the reasons behind existence of "not real bitcoin" is reddit strict censorship?

I made a small order at Genesis Mining in December 2016. Payouts still coming regularly. I didn't made back in bitcoin, but in fiat in profit. Wouldn't say it a "total" scam.

I'm sure bitcoin is great long term investment. The problem with short term price fluctuations is that one BTCUSD price affects whole cryptomarket. Despite overall good news, Consensus, development updates,  Market Cap is going down last days.

Sad to see tiny orderbooks at proper P2P exchanges like HodlHodl or Bisq, while LocalBitcoins grabbed all liquidity before, changed rules, and screwing people with KYC now.
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:16:00
Hodlhodl exchange solved KYC problem with help of Bitcoin's multisig, when exchange doesn't hold customers funds, so it is not subject to complex compliance procedures like KYC.

Thank you! Gave it a second look and found offers in my country.
@_date: 2019-11-29 08:11:42
More KYC on some exchanges -&gt; more users looking for another services -&gt; more adoption of Hodlhodl, Bisq, LocalCryptos... Solutions are already here waiting for customers. Thanks to broken legacy systems we have Bitcoin, and same systems helping to move adoption in right direction.

I was wrong about advantages. You can short shitcoins on Polo. Though short crypto after 6 month of bear market... Anyway full freezing of account is not acceptable.
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:59:50
Circle acquired Poloniex and after they changed their policy. Basically they take away users funds and offering them back in exchange for personal information. Fuck this. Poloniex has no advantages compare to Bittrex or Binance, but instead of improving service they stealing users money. You can keep my 50$, Polo, with your new shitty reputation.

Probably one of the reasons for premium is lower liquidity compared to Coinbase, so bid-ask spreads are bigger. Spreads should get smaller when more people using P2P exchanges.
