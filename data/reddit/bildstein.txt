I think get what I mean.
The whole point of depositing Bitcoins would be to have them in someone else's (safe) hands (and maybe earn interest, but I'm not sure). Then you don't 'have' Bitcoins anymore, you just have an account balance with a trusted organisation, and a legal framework that helps to keep them honest. Then they can do whatever they like with 'your' Bitcoins, as long as they still have enough to pay you back when needed.

Long time lurker, haven't posted since before existed, but this idea has really been bugging me, because it seems at odds with a lot of the ideology here.
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the ideology. I just think this isn't going to play out the way everyone expects.
My question is, where do I go wrong in reaching the following conclusion:
* People are really bad at securing themselves and their assets. (That's why insurance is so popular, and why we don't hide cash under our mattresses.)
* Bitcoin is currency.
* Rather than risk losing any significant amount of currency, most people would prefer to have it in a bank. (And remember! 'Lose' can mean hacked/stolen, but it can also mean lost/destroyed/forgotten-password/denied-access!)
* Banks will (eventually) be able to accept Bitcoin deposits, like any other currency.
* They'll apply their security skills and resources, have insurance, charge fees.
* Once I've transferred my Bitcoins to a bank, I have an 'account' (they owe me Bitcoin, and must give me some on demand).
* Banks will be allowed to lend Bitcoin, just as they are allowed to lend cash (transfer the Bitcoin I deposited to another person, who will then owe the bank Bitcoin, and pay interest) - as long as they still have a decent amount of Bitcoin left to pay those customers who want to withdraw.
* We now have fractional reserve banking, banks haven't changed their business models, Bitcoin is treated just like any other currency, and... what was the point of Bitcoin again?
Is my conclusion wrong? Or can we say that one of those steps just won't happen?
Because from where I sit, it seems like they all inevitably will - if Bitcoin proves to be a generally useful and sought after currency, in the medium term.
