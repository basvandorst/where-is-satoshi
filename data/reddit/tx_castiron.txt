Don't forget your insurance company.  I'm sure if they could they would happily pay banks to find out how much one spent on alcohol, tobacco, weed shops, fast food, soda, high risk sports and the like.

I can't remember how many times I watched that bitcoin faucet video of the guy dressed like a hippy in tie dye with the round sunglasses.  Got something like .0004 btc or something like that for every time you viewed it.  I think I accumulated about .5 btc total from that.  Think it was around 2012 or so.

My dad is 75 and he gets bitcoin just fine.  He even called me on the 22nd to wish me a happy Bitcoin Pizza Day.

My dad is 75 and he "gets" bitcoin pretty well.
Last year at this time he even called to wish me a happy Bitcoin Pizza Day.
