this approach is called proof of space. It's not terribly novel in the context of replay-spending prevention. Maybe the true solution is in a hybrid of work, space and stake?

his argument may be goofed but he has a point: anarcho-capitalism is fundamentally self-contradictory. Capitalism creates a hierarchy of capital, it can only otherwise be mitigated by a state, or a move away from capitalism.

this reminds me of the argument "well if she didn't want to be assaulted she shouldn't have dressed like a slut!"

btw that's what hype/shilling/huckstery language (idk what else to call it) looks like. It's going to go up on sept 19th? why sept 19th? ? "underground circles" give me a break.
It's almost like you want to be taken for a ride.

I am so disillusioned by the hucksters in this community.

I didn't notice it either until after roughly a year of veganism, now I can usually tell if something has dairy in it.

Literally retarded

You've never noticed the disgusting film that dairy laced products leave in your mouth?

I think you're not wrong, but it's a bit of a chicken egg scenario. r/btc begat BCH, it's not like they could retroactively change their sub name and a total migration was not feasible or necessary. The premise behind a hard fork is that the 'dominant' chain would retain the 'bitcoin' name, so it follows that being the 'one true bitcoin' becomes an object of their desires.

It's really a tragedy what aramco has done to that country.

lolbertarianism: backwoods ideology. "I do me and you do you" is a fine way to live your life, but yeah, you can't build much of a society with it.

You just said a whole lot of nothing

Bitcoin is not the stock market. And hodl just means don't panic sell- it's not a good primary strategy.

same. when I first saw it it was $7 a coin.

In all fairness, people probably wouldn't have. This is a time when the dotcom bubble burst was happening, cellphones were still bricks and social media hadn't been invented yet, let alone the likes of wikipedia or stack exchange. People understood batteries, like the ones in a flashlight, but a cpu? gpu? may as well have been magic metal wafers

People think the scientific method is some edict; when science gets replaced with better science, *that means its working*.

logarithmic scaling is often the more 'human one', but I suppose it depends on what type of data you're looking at. At least with frequency content (harmonics, acoustics) humans perceive sound logarithmicly (ex. the difference between 2000hz and 2100hz is two orders of magnitude less differentiable by ear than 20hz and 21hz). I'm not sure how, or if that's different in this setting, but I'd venture a guess that's a 'more human' way to perceive value in relation to growth.

Wow. I consider myself a bona fide matrix fan, and yet I've never heard this theory before and it's mind-blowingly awesome. Thanks for explaining.

I use my car on a daily basis and even though I grasp the concept of internal combustion engines I still hate cars. I use my fridge on a daily basis and yet I don't understand the specifics behind coolants and compression. you're not wrong though.

Wow! people trend towards the option that says it'll take the least amount of effort? who knew?
