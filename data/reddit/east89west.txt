Can I link this to a bank account in France?? 
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:17:53
Agreed! 
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:42:58
Can I link a French bank account to circle? 
@_date: 2014-09-10 14:07:42
Right now, yes. If/when there is another price increase, no. It's all relative 
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:31:48
Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:38:42
So is it even worth watching at this point? All of the information has to be extremely dated, right? 
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:52:09
Plan A is the overwhelming majority in the community it would seems. Makes sense
@_date: 2014-11-26 02:15:16
Then leave 
@_date: 2014-10-01 18:48:38
You guys are great! Keep up the good work! 
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:19:59
Wish there was a way I could set the blockchain app on my android to do this!!! Devs if your listening cough cough hint hint
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:11:08
Well, for arguments sake we do have both of those now, they're just extremely rudimentary. Google it
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:21:25
Multi signature transactions here can help. If it works for the deep Web I don't see why It can't work elsewhere 
@_date: 2014-10-08 03:56:55
where can i find the torcc config file? sorry, im a newb stumbling through this app right now
@_date: 2014-09-04 23:02:04
I second this! 
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:39:44
Okay I'll check it out, thanks. Would you recommend it for people who are completely unfamiliar with bitcoin? Thinking about sending it to some family members 
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:18:44
How kind of you
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:43:33
Hey I'd be Interested in this too! Mind if I pm you? 
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:49:50
Why can't I find this in the play store?? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:39:13
Seeing as how's they don't even require email I would say yes
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:57:20
Any idea what their fees to cash out to euro from bitcoin are? 
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:07:54
Anyone Know if this works for France? 
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:15:10
Well I clicked the link but the site never loaded, I was on my Chromebook (chrome OS), and stayed on the page for about 15 seconds with nothing but a blank screen before closing the window. I checked my download folder and nothing has been downloaded before Christmas. Any risk you think? 
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:02:42
Circle or coinbase? Circle is definitely instant 
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:54:46
Why is there a cake next to your username? I noticed I have one today too! Is it our Reddit birthday?! 
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:06:40
Good stuff Erik, your doing great work, keep it up! :) One suggestion however, change the "currency unit" in point 2 from 'bitcoins' to 'bits'. People who have been around long enough know the difference, and its better to introduce new people to the concept of bitcoins divisibility now, rather than later. I just read a comment from a newb talking about the price of 1 bitcoin as if that was all they could purchase, some the misconception is most certainly still there. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:31:13
Yea, so fake I can buy stuff with it! Crazyyyy 
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:49:25
Oh wow, that's really weird to say the least but okay great, thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2014-09-27 02:19:27
I appreciate the thorough response, I'll be sure to add much of it to my response in the topic thread! :) 
@_date: 2014-09-04 18:56:49
Ehh I just don't see the demand for something like that yet in a college town. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:47:49
OMG such a good idea! You totes should!!! 
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:16:38
Circle took me like 2 minutes to link to my debit card and buy instantly. Almost as easy as signing up for an email account. Coinbase is different though, unless you have a visa card, then you can buy instantly after signing up. This is money were talking about after all here 
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:02:34
Fantastic, keep up the good work! 
@_date: 2014-10-08 03:37:48
do you have anything to back this claim up? seems wildly speculative to me, as this news has been out for 24 hours and nowhere have i seen a giant controversy about the issue.  Its been known that the code needs to change to scale further, it wasnt a question of if, but when.  That is if you subscribe to the belief that bitcoin will see further adoption in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:51:12
Who exactly is Nick szabo? I can't seem to find anything with too much detail online. No pictures of the guy either 
@_date: 2014-09-20 03:49:20
Ahoyyyy there laddie! 
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:21:26
Yes I'm very interested! What resources do you speak of? 
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:14:28
They did in an earlier one. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:35:03
Merry Christmas! :) Love this community, whatever happens it's been a trip, glad to say that I've been a part of it, no matter the outcome. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:11:47
Anyone have an ELI5 for this? 1to 10, how serious is this to bitcoin in the long term, realistically 
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:05:57
Yea that's what I was thinking. Do you think I'm at risk with having clicked that link? It's only a watch address so I don't think they could get anything they could use off that, right? Just want to make sure I'm being as safe as possible. Appreciate the help! :) 
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:26:11
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:08:51
Yea, but to them that might be a turnoff to potential customers. Better to place it in a user agreement that you know most likely no one will read. I signed on the other day from my computer and just clicked through it without thinking. Honestly at this point were tailored to just agree to changes in terms like this. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:54:45
Maybe this policy is geared more towards people who purchase directly using ACH. As far as I know there is no credit report required to open a checking account. Either way, I can somewhat empathize with why they are doing this in regards to risk aversion. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:37:36
Because your credit card already ran your credit report before you got it
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:50:25
Possibly bad news on the ETF? 
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:39:43
Thanks for the reminder, will be sure to send a few bucks around this evening on the twitter-sphere! :) 
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:20:36
That's definitely understandable, and perhaps I'm being too cursory in my evaluation of the implications. Am I correct in assuming that you will be discontinuing your use of Coinbase? I have a small amount that I have been accruing there recently, would you advise cold storage as a preferable alternative? 
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:43:17
Oh Lord. How much more can we take??! 
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:11:46
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:06:44
Think of it this way. Bitcoin is the network, bits are the unit. When I open my wallet with 1 'bitcoin', it's says I have 1,000,000 bits. Now, $50k or $500k is years away IF it ever happens. There are already talks of changing the standard unit in the system to bits THIS year.. So you tell me.. 10 years from now, does 1 bit for $0.50 or $1 sound ludicrous?? All a matter of perspective 
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:02:09
Was interested to hear his points but he doesn't really give many even though he says there are a multiple. He states growing illequidity is a concern (is liquidity diminishing?) and also the lack of govt backing (not sure how I feel about this one) . Also he states that bitcoin 'generates no income', which confuses me, because it's not supposed to generate Income (unless I'm missing something). 
What does concern me is the uneven distribution (predominantly western/asian countries). I'm the biggest bitcoin fan ever, but this last year has worn me the hell down. Not sure what to think anymore 
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:24:56
Well, that's somewhat disconcerting, is it not? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:13:09
Where do you set up these buys? I'm using coinbase in the US but now would like to find somewhere fast and reliable to set up staggered buys for when/if I'm unable to watch the charts. What's the best exchange to use stateside that I won't have to wait weeks to verify for? If any
@_date: 2015-01-25 15:25:43
Haha right?? That was my thought. Wouldn't 40-50 be more lower middle? 80k would be right in the middle middle class I would say, with 100k+ being upper middle

The fillmore theater Miami Beach. Today and this weekend
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:37:03
So what, is it option A. Good news and this is manipulation to get cheap coins before a sharp rise, or B. Bad news with insiders selling before the real crash comes? 
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:10:58
Are their fees to sell the same as in the US? 
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:40:24
So does this mean the average Joe can buy into 'BIT' from regular avenues like Ameritrade/E-Trader etc?? 
@_date: 2015-02-07 03:12:35
Damn! Am this seems like a pretty big deal, or am I just over thinking it? 
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:34:55
Great work guys!
