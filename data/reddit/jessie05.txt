No I didn't make any backups of that stuff(hindsight.. 20/20), I was using the bitcoin client to access my wallet.

ssh into the machine? Would you mind elaborating a little more on that? Is that like remote access? I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that, the computer wasn't a mac it was like an old Vista laptop, an HP.

I was afraid of that.. thanks for answering. Hopefully if these people hit other cars the police can catch on and I can retrieve what they stole, but last time they didn't really do anything about my car being broken into(happened a few years back). So I doubt it.

My cousin did do a remote access to my laptop a few months back when I needed help with something, so maybe he still has a way to get on it I'll ask him. I was just using the wallet that the bitcoin client provides.

Good piece of advice, I know now.

Wow... now that 5 BTC I lost seems completely insignificant... some people sure did make out with this whole thing.

Ahh... yeah probably unlikely, thanks though for the comments I appreciate you taking the time to try to help.

I don't blame the ones trying to get his attention, but by now there's probably 1000's trying to message him, you have a better chance at finding a needle in a haystack than getting his attention for a tip now lol.
