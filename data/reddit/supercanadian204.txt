My Sportsbook offers a prop bet for "Any premier league club to buy a player using bitcoin in 2018" odds are 21x times wager. Think it can happen in 2018?

Thanks. Thats kinda the answer I was looking for. No option to short it. So will just stay away.

which stock shall I dump my bitcoin into then OP? You can't say it's a bad investment because there is a small handful of better investments. Meanwhile there are thousands of worse ones. Dumbest post I've ever seen in this sub

I've trade BTC to LTC and back from LTC to BTC, its a slow grind but I've never lost money. I've gained crypto in the process. Basically if you think both coins you are trading in will rise in value in the long term you can't really lose out. The only risk is if you have LTC, and BTC grows faster or vice versa, you may not make as much as you would have hodling otherwise.

This guy has a new prediction almost daily. He hasn't been right yet, but I suppose he is bound to be correct on at least one of these predictions.

I'm starting to feel more and more like OP.  I hold some LTC, but 2 months ago 1 LTC = .01750BTC and today, 1 LTC = .01088BTC.   
When you are only looking at the dollar value of each it doesn't seem so bad, but when you see how much less LTC is worth today compared to bitcoin, you can't help but feel like you've taken an L.

No social benefit? How about taking control of our own money.
