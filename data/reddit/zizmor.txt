The FED has been increasing the interest rate throughout 2017 and will continue to do so during 2018 (as stated in the December meeting). By the and of 2018 the interest rates will likely be above 2%. Barring something very unusual nobody seems to expect a dramatic downturn of the economy in 2018. Growth rate will be less the S&amp;P and Dow will not increase as much as they did in 2017 but it is unlikely that there will be a major crisis. 2019 will likely bring some significant slowing. 
I understand that you are excited about blockchain technology but forgive me if I call you naive in thinking people's confidence and trust in central banks will be shaken in the foreseeable future. Even after 2008 -THE major economic crisis of the last 70 or so years- central banks are considered as the cornerstone of global financial system. Yes they have been heavily criticized both in Europe and US but nobody in their right mind argued that we should be done with them. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have increased greatly in value not because people are fed up with the central banks and the financial system but because low interest rates of the last 10 years have left so much liquid money in the markets, some of which ended up being invested in them. A serious economic crisis or recession will not result in people putting their money in cryptocurrencies but doing the exact opposite by taking their money out and putting it into safer instruments such as.... wait for it... US treasury bonds. 
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are great technologically but if you think they present an actual alternative to the existing financial system at this stage, I think you are seriously mistaken. Best of luck though.

I have an honest question for you. Can you explain to me where would I go to get a business loan in a society, where there are no banks and everything is run on cryptocurrency?

Not to refute your point but I find it baffling that a theoretical physicist is giving this long speech about society and civilization 
-neither of which he is clearly in no way an expert of-. I guess it is up to sociologists and historians to educate us about supernovas, antimatter, and black holes.

It is not so much the range of price but the clockwork predictability of the movement direction for the last 4-5 weekends is worthy of discussion maybe? 
Every Friday we see a small dip, followed by a price high on Saturday afternoon to Sunday noon (though the high point becomes lower every week) that tank very rapidly on Sunday or early Monday morning (these are based on East Coast US time zone).   
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:30:24
Beginning of the business week has seen lower prices than the weekend for the last three weeks in a row, and did not pick up after. I'm not sure what are you basing your suggestion on.

This is the equivalent of saying what would be so bad about Dow going down to 15K tomorrow, it would be still up from 10K of 2010. This is not how returns are calculated, otherwise unless an asset goes to absolute zero it is always up from some point in its existence.

You're right, actually the entire cyrptocurrency phenomenon has not been tested in a protracted bear market or a serious economic crash. It's been relatively good times since the invention of BTC.

What makes Bitcoin the best implementation/application of this technology? Why not Ethereum or another coin? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:50:43
If you think stocks are returning 6% in this bull market, you are the real ignorant one here. S&amp;P gained almost 5% in this month alone, while BTC has lost close to 25%. Just like he rode the upswing in BTC he can ride the upswing in stocks, which will likely to continue for a couple of quarters at least -especially with the new tax cuts-. But hey you know best.

Wow you have been hodling since 2011, you must be the authority to tell us about how to make sense of Bitcoin, and for that you certainly deserve all the due respects in the world.

I usually like his talks but this one is quite unconvincing. I get the idea but mining operations are not as movable as he implies. There is massive hardware involved so you can't -or won't- just go to Zimbabwe to do your mining next month because electricity there is cheaper. 
His second point is a perfect example of whataboutism and doesn't do much to answer the original question. You say Bitcoin is wasteful oh yeah, what about the armored trucks and banks etc... Yes they are wasteful too, that doesn't make Bitcoin's wastefulness a non-issue. 
Unfortunately despite all the rhetorical shenanigans Andreas employs, the simple fact is that in terms of energy use Bitcoin is very wasteful. More so if in the future it is replaced by another cryptocurrency and loses much of its value. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:12
Coinbase holds its USD accounts in FDIC insured banks -since FDIC only insures banks and Coinbase is not a bank-, so it is not literally insured by FDIC. Even if it was, FDIC has nothing to do with insider trader regulations. It is the SEC -Securities and Exchange Commission- that deals with insider trading regarding securities. Bitcoin, or any digital currency, is NOT a security, therefore insider trading regulations do not apply to any of this.

All your post tells me is that you have very little clue about the mindset of someone with $50 million. Devaluation of the USD is almost a non-issue for anyone with that much wealth. Not because it isn't happening but because it is happening on a predictable scale/speed and can be protected against.

You should buy bitcoin with every penny you have, if you can you should also take out as many loans from banks as you can and buy more bitcoin with those. If you have any way of using leverage you should definitely use it to buy more bitcoin. Also, if you had any money put aside for you kids college, or any sort of long term savings you should immediately convert them to bitcoin too. This way when world markets crash and all the money flow into crypto you will be all set.  
While you're at it you should also continue asking random strangers on the internet for financial advice regularly, and follow the advice you receive from them. That's the way for a happy and secure future for you and your family, best of luck to you.

I can't believe how lucky we are. I mean all other generations had to work hard, be responsible, and put money aside every paycheck in order to enjoy a comfortable retirement. Whereas all we have to do is to spend $150 now, don't save a single penny after, and open our accounts in 30 years and enjoy the rest of our days. Amazing technology this blockchain.

I live in a major metropolitan center in the US, a loaf of fancy artisanal bread was around 5 bucks last year and it still was 5 bucks as of this morning. The same goes for cheap bread, which is 3 rolls for 1 dollar. The price of premium gas was around $3.1 per gallon in last winter and it is the same right now (two months ago it was $2.8 a gallon). I don't know where you live but the inflation figures you mention does not match my reality in the US.
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:27:12
Got you. Also -as you put it- regardless of the actual inflation numbers

No such thing has happened. What really happened is a bunch of wacko guys declared independence for New California. 
The real ballot initiative that Draper funded did not even get enough signatures to actually make it to the ballot. 
If you really think California is going to get split into smaller states in the foreseeable future then I guess you would have no problem believing everyone using Bitcoin in five years.

For the price to go up to 20k again outside money has to come in. Most outside money was spooked by the December/January crash. No ordinary person, on whose money BTC can go up to 20k, knows or cares about segwit, bitcoin code, lightning etc.

It is not the case for a lot of other countries. Actually the levels of inflation Venezuela experienced this year is unique to Venezuela at the moment. An overwhelming majority of humans would have done better if they had kept their fiat currency in 2018 instead of holding Bitcoin. Check for yourself.

You are really not getting the immensity of the capital invested in various credit markets. Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies combined is a small fly next to that elephant.
You are really not seeing how easy it is to use a credit card whereas how convoluted owning and storing cryptocurrencies. If my 80 old grandma cannot use it easily then it has no real competitive power against credit cards. 
Yes you can tell me all about fiat scam, deflationary currency, ease of transaction, decentralization etc... None of it matters to my grandma, and billions like her.

You have to wait for the US to wake up. Only when it is 10 am East Coast US, you can see its full results. I think there will be sales -most Americans are waking up to a BTC that is very decidedly below 10 K for the first time this side of the ATH-.

And somehow you think in the case of a global financial meltdown people are going to flock to cryptocurrencies.

Yeah he's the guy, who spent millions trying to get Californians to vote for splitting their state into 6. He's also the guy, who's wrong about everyone using Bitcoin in 5 years.

Most people, who invest in cryptocurrencies and who will invest in the future doesnt' give a rat's ass about the libertarian ideals. Bitcoin has long passed the stage of being an online movement for libertarian dreams. For it to grow more the exchanges must be regulated in one form or another.
The alternative is a Wild West kind of market, where a handful of big players use it as their playground. Believe me couple of years of that and you will have a hard time finding anyone investing a dime more in cryptocurrencies.

Yes I agree, and only those true believers are going to be admitted to heaven and be able to drink the elixir of eternal life from the hands of prophet Satoshi himself.

You're right about his election being unprecedented and going against all the expectations. Yet thinking that this marginal win (in terms of actual votes) was due to his mastermind or deep strategizing on his part is quite misleading.
We can acknowledge the impressiveness of him getting elected without necessarily making him into someone, who he is not. Everything since he took office shows again and again that he is way out of his depth and have little control over his administration. He is not an exceptional guy, he just happened to hijack Republican candidacy at an exceptional time. We will certainly see this better after 2020 elections.
