There is a lot to learn mate and after you have learned it you still won't know the answer.

Well I watched to the end, very trippy 
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:13:22
I believe there will be more drops. And forget another ATH in December it won't happen.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:21:18
Well, I agree totally and believe the dip hasn't finished yet. I also believe that we will need to hodle for a long period of time, I don't see a new ATH coming this year.
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:51:57
Keep dreaming!!!
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:38:27
"recall the value of the technology." And what is that....
I hear all the time people saying we are in it for the technology, what a load of crap, we are all in it for the money. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:00:26
Yep same as above, little by little.

I am assuming Australia, Dec 18 it peaked at $26,029 including exchange rate on coinspot.
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:39:28
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:52:52
Interesting. I will be watching to see if coinspot is registered.

" and in a lot of states marijuana is decriminalised" And what states would they be....
@_date: 2018-04-29 07:41:07
I believe this will be a growing issue and not just in india, That is why it is best to keep your mouth shut and not tell anyone you invest in crypto. I have seen adds for t shirts that advertise bitcoin or other coins and just shake my head in horror that people would wear this stuff. I commented on a post form the guy advertising the t shirts and said it was "a good way to get a gun stuck to your head" and he replied why is that. Hmmm think about it!!!
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:07:32
Don't get cocky... it won't last long.
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:14:56
