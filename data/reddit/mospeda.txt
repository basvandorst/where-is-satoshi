Honest question. Given that Luke - how should I put this - has issues with Gavin, did a consensus exists concerning this decision, or was this a 'midnight' move from one camp?
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:46:13


Mike Hearn said that? Source please.

what's with all the spelling and grammatical errors? It's like you aren't even trying.
On a more serious note, this is the second spoof attempt this month, right? Perhaps an announcement in Meta is due. Don't be fooled by the broken English in the email. It serves a [purpose](

In the last two years, BTC's price rose from $18 to $1,151 (a 6,300% spike) before slumping down to $200+ (an 85% drop) in a very turbulent January. Even the [2000s commodities boom]( doesn't come close to that. He's not wrong. BTC is ridiculously volatile. We've seen how mini dumps and buys from a few trades at Bitstamp can influence the market exponentially.

Not a single Bitcoiner I personally know has ever visited Silk Road or consumed any Class A drugs. 
Not trying to be rude, but using your logic, is [Adam Telford]( your hero as well, since he hails from Tyneside, and you're a proud Geordie?
@_date: 2015-01-21 02:35:22
Thank you so much for this very thoughtful and comprehensive response. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:05:11
So from commodities you've suddenly switched to stock? In your mind, is BTC anything remotely like *stocks*? 
You've even resorted to putting words in my mouth - and you dare use words like retarded? Oh, the irony.
You're not helping Bitcoin with this kind of head in the sand approach.

OP, I wonder if they're pleased to have their faces (partial or otherwise) plastered on Imgur and Reddit. I'd be annoyed if someone did that to me. That said, Lydia is all kinds of wonderful.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:20:49
Luke, what's the downside of this, if any?
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:53:46
Goodness. You make some wild, baseless insinuations that you can't substantiate, yet I'm the one trolling? lol.
I'm still waiting for your statistics.
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:36:32
Care to share those statistics? I'd be interested to look at them. IMHO though, I think you're buying into media sensationalism and using it as a cudgel against the entire community.
I've been on Bitcointalk forum and Reddit for almost three years, and just like in real life, I've yet to encounter anyone actively using or promoting hard drugs. The majority of Bitcoiners I interact with are professionals and students.
I would also like to add that supporting the fundamental principle of a decentralized marketplace like Silk Road does not mean blind automatic support for assassinations, drug cartels or biker gangs.

Post it here first, BG. I'm curious (although I'm more curious why people would pay $14,000 for *art* made by a random anonymous ~~wood~~ laser engraver).

That's a little scary, tbh. Anyway, 
(i) Update your definition of Malwarebytes and perform a scan.
(ii) DO NOT type in any of your passwords before the scan is completed.
(iii) If your system is clean, change the email linked to your exchange accounts.
(iv) Change your passwords, but do not use any password generation application.
Good luck.

Not at all. A consensus between core developers and major miners is pretty much all that is needed to change the protocol. Once enough nodes adopt any new protocol, it would succeed the previous one/s.
As to why anyone would want to do so and destabilize Bitcoin's deflationary drawcard, well, that needs a thread or ten of its own. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:34:41
I don't know. Eric Tymoigne's easily rebuttable 'cons' position does Bitcoin no favors. It would not have changed the minds of any serious investors. In fact, some of the arguments made by the *assistant professor of economics* is downright juvenile. I have a feeling a WSJ editor made  some calls and he was the only *name* available. I wouldn't be surprised if he had no exposure to BTC prior to this.
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:07:07
EV, is that you? Has any of the core developers reached out to the four named persons or chainalysis directly?
can you update the OP with the Twitter links/email adds of Grønager, Møller, Hilligsøe and Larsen for the community's easy reference?
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:19:25
Difference 1: 51% attack != 51% of hashing power
Difference 2: If the five core devs and other major devs decide to implement a new protocol today*, and one major miner, say Ghash, falls in line, their reputation alone would compel an eventual transition. As an example, in August 2010, Satoshi and Gavin rolled back the block chain after the discovery of a bug in the source code. He made the move after achieving a private consensus with other core devs .
**I'm not implying they would*
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:37:04
You are confusing 51% attack with consensus. 
Consensus doesn't require a magical 51% threshold, as I covered in the previous post. A consensus does not lead to malicious double-spending. And finally, a 51% attack doesn't necessarily require 51% of the network hashing power; some speculate the figure could be as low as 25%, but that is entirely besides the point of your original contention.

I wouldn't put too much weight on this $ 3,861.00 report. 
For one thing, as a small market intelligence firm, controversial reports give Juniper some sorely needed brand recognition and exposure.
For another, their analysts interviewed, among others, Polycoin (what?) and Ripple (its like interviewing North Korea on the subject of U.S.)!
And finally, we are already anticipating a contraction in the crypto market this year. The exuberance of late 2013 and early 2014 has cooled off, newly setup mining enterprises (chiefly from mainland China) have a *dump first ask questions later* strategy, and the alt cloning explosion has tapered down as the market becomes more mature.
Plus, the market will probably remain bearish until the halving in 2016.

[Oh, come on]( Why would China risk €430 billion worth of bilateral trade with the Eu which could potentially crippled its own economy as well? This does not take into consideration that a quarter of its foreign reserves is in euros.
Where would Russia find enough funds considering they've ransacked every piggy bank in Moscow? 
More importantly, how would Greece as a nation finance the import of basic essentials such as oil, meat, sugar, etc.? Picture the economic devastation as factories close down, bank stops lending money, and unemployment soars.
TL;DR: I honestly don't understand why people are agreeing with your outlandish notions.
