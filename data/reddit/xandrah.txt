Yeah I know exactly how you feel, I made the mistake a few years back of getting a new workstation system with a few BTC.

Really scary honestly, I think I will just make them the slow way which I have done since 2009! Mining, its less risky.

I have noticed a lot of this, seems to be falsely pumping BCH hype.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:44:01
That's rough indeed, I made the same mistake a year ago. At least you made a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:59:02
Hah I knew it, my my the bitmain CEO wont be happy~
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:36:33
Its quite incredible how it has taken off this year! Still greedy though.. all I am doing is hoarding!
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:03:41
That could be it, but imagine loosing out on 7k if it did go wrong!
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:22:57
Climbing nicely, we are at around 7200 mark. I can imagine a few made a nice cash out from the recent drop and recovery.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:57:06
Its more of me asking the question of how they do it, you get these ATM's in Japan too, and its always puzzled me how do they do it, as if I cash out, I get it instantly, im not waiting around the street for 6 or so confirms.

Very good! And this is what Bitcoin is for, governments cannot inflate it, they cannot print it! They cannot control it! And they hate it!
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:05:00
That's the whole scheme, they want to pump it as much as possible, pretty low using hacked accounts though. I really hope nobody is buying into BCH at the moment.

Typical! Even JP kept hyping it was a bubble to burst, now finally folds and invests in Bitcoin :P
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:42:45
The media only likes the bad news of Bitcoin, so of course its always hyped to the extreme, look what happened the other day when we dropped below 5,600 USD? Supposedly that was the end of Bitcoin, just ignore it. I have been with Bitcoin since 2009.

Of course this has been going on for a while, just look at antminer.com they only allow BCH now, and for this very reason, he profits from it and is a founder of BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:05:08
Not sure why they are so slow now, they practically jumped for BCH, most likely scared them from the flop and shady pump and dumps.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:01:43
What are the transaction fees like on this unit, that's whats got me more curious, since you are not relying on confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:46:06
Its also why antpool/antminer creator is pumping BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:25:10
Of course, its mass panic to try and make people buy up BCH before the creators give it another massive dump, then repeat the cycle and invest into it again, bring it back up 209% then DUMP once more.

Mining with computers is dead I am afraid unless you go the altcoin route, you need at least 20 Th/s under your belt to mine bitcoin directly and actually see some returns.

Plot twist: He is a ken doll, its smooth down there.
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:47:03
Ahh ironic, we have some of the biggest scammers here pushing this" "Genesis Mining" for one.
