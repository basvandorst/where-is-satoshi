One can’t at the same time be a proponent of privacy &amp; regulations. And no privacy means collectivism &amp; totalitarian. So simple!

What about successful double-spends on BTG?
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:30:09
Correct. Is there any way to check what is the length of the orphaned chain containing block with this particular tx?
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:40:05
It is possible any PoW, its just a question of controlling 51% and/or some luck. 
Its easier to do for shitcoins since they have much lower hash power, however its onle the question of price for BTC as well. 
If there was a drop in hashrate it could be a double spend.

The longest chain can’t have two spends anyway, double spend attack looks differently: 
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:29:53
Seems like it was included into a now orphaned chain. Meaning its double spend, not an attempt. I got the report of it liked to the dropdown in BTC hashrate. I’m trying to figure out the details and see if that was true

The only problem with the brain wallets is the stoke, that can damage the brain

Got it, I will know that for the future

Typhon is a **non-**2-way peg trustless sidechain solution that can be implemented using existing Bitcoin Script functionality, i.e. without any soft- or hardforks.
Existing sidechain 2-way peg technologies require soft or hardforks, and currently can operate only in trusted mode under federated multisig contracts. You can think of Typhon as of massively-scalable multiparty payment channels. The protocol defines the process of sidechain formation and operations on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain; it is censorship-resistant, permissionless and agnostic to the particular consensus and blockchain formation protocol used by sidechain implementations.
And no new coins, tokens or ICOs :)

Just try to read the text and you will find the answer on the "what's the heck" right in there. And the point of sidechains is not to bring balance to sidechain, otherwise it will be reciprocal definition :D

The algo is consensus-agnostic outside of the condition above. It can work with avalanche for instance, and avalanche then would not need it's own token, it can be using bitcoin than :)

1. It's not about making coin creators way for living, it's about funding new projects around bitcoin (like RSK). There is no new coins in my sample, there is a 1-to-1 peg to bitcoin in a sidechain (like SBTC in RSK) and a new type of limited equity to benefit from venture (which is not a coin)
2. Wallets must be opensources, i.e. can be easily copied and would not give desired benefits for a venture. The proposed model is more sustained and clear.

It is possible, but it is not an optimal strategy. First, there is no relation of the success of the project with the return on investments. Second, the wallet itself is a different venture. Projects like Mimblewimble/Grin and RSK will certainly need to be better funded than can be done via just a "mobile wallet app". Third, such projects needs funds upfront, before the launch of the network, and an "open source wallet app which we will do one we finish the network" is not a good story for investors on the early stage and their returns. 
Lucas from Switzerland Bitcoin Association gave a good talk on that issues on BIP001, you can see it here:
