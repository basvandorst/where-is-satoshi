I had like 1,000 doge coin I mined on my firm's PCs, as a joke.  Whoops.  HDDs all got shredded.

The horror.

Yeah, wasn't making any cash, so I was like fuck it, I'm out.

I like rubbing it in.  My coworker bought in at $10000 and bragged about the Tesla he was going to buy.  I told him to get out at 16.5K.  He bought more at $19k.

You can't really use Bitcoin for much.  Not like you can walk into 7/11 and buy a coke and a pack of cigarettes.  Haven't seen a grocery store that takes it in NYC.
Without a use for it, it simply has become a tulip bulb.

Perhaps that clip of the yacht getting trashed is appropriate at the moment.

I mean, isn't the slow transaction time one of those things you should've known about before going in?
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:48:14
One of those will grow.
But if BTC hits $1, I'll buy $5k worth.

LOL fuck off.  Unrealized gains don't mean a thing.

If it's supposed to be a currency, shouldn't I be able to walk into a 7-11 and buy a soda like i do with USD?
I don't see that happening anywhere...

Ah, Price is right rules in full effect, I see.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:51:36
You outbid me by one cent, so closest without going over, you win.
You've seen The Price is Right, yes?

Swap Google for Lehman Brothers ca. 2007 and think about that...
