Fake. No source. Writen too complicated. Including details, i simple can't understand.

3000? They are now 2500. WTF.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:28:35
Hopefully never, because high fees will keep miners on board.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:07:28
I like r/btc, because you see all the diffrent opinions, which are anti-bitcoin. Good place to learn.

They had a big No2X win this week, so they could take some time for their own. Next week they will start a new chapter and crush BCH.

This is the advantage of high fees. Just think, the small hodlers start to move coins as well, the amount of transactions would go to moon (high fees are a nice sellwall). Bad for them, but good for bitcoin, deal with it.

3.000? We are at 2.500 now. What will haben, if they really reach 3.000?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:46:47
Yes, who can't afford the fees, can't afford bitcoin. That's life, my poor hodlers.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:32:12
Yes, that's the best sellwall we have. Did think about it as well. Small Hodlers are stucked.

Sounds a little bit like Britney. Come on, act! Act now!
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:52:08
Good move. 1600$ for free cash is a halleluja in the morning. Sell and run ...

WTF are you? The master of Bitcoin? Satochi 2.0?
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:23:13
Cool, how many satoshis to you want for one? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:04:14
Yes, but we will hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:32:28
But Buterin don't like the tangle, maybe we have to ask the core Devs, if they could have a look of it ... i've the feeling, it's a lot better than lightning.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:07:38
It's all about the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:11:02
Crammar scared me as hell. Price spike 》 fee spike 》 downhill ...

3.000? We are at 2.500 now. What will haben, if they really reach 3.000?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:43:29
No, Hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:45:12
It's time to smoke the peace pipe! Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, only together, they are strong. Mark these words.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:38:53
Do you have a link for the amount of unconfirmed transactions atm? Fake?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:03:24
It's just a mirror of reality ... cash &amp; gold
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:46:39
Wait for a week, BCH will get also a correction, and then buy BTC. Learn to live with reds, we all had to learn our lessons.

And, does it matter? Not really, that's just the world we are living ...
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:07:20
fees, fees, fees ... i can't hear this anymore. Wait for flash and all will be ok. Patience. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:12:33
Bitfin, 2.580, 5 minutes before.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:45
fc*k, mempool is also getting huge.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:51:58
Did Adam switch to the BCash team? Does he forget, high fees keep miners on board?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:14:27
Yesterday, the told everybody the fees on bitcoin are over 9$, i just paid only 6,4$. Take that as prove, that they are just phony ... 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:19:54
I 've also a strange feeling about the amount of endorsement of TV and Wall Street in the last days ... maybe the want to kill bitcoin and show normies, it's just a Ponzi ...
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:42:16
STFU, it's a normal correction, we see every year. The smart  ones have sold yesterday and are waiting for the big dip.
