I'm actually glad to see that Vault of Satoshi **was not** included on that list. The fact that these major exchanges had enough of a warning to construct a very specific joint-statement implies a level of coordination and action on non-public information. 
After the failings of Mt.Gox, and the way that trades have occurred over the past few days, I've become pretty cynical. I can see how easy it would be for those insiders to abuse this information for personal gain.

If you are day trading (on any exchange), you're likely paying fees on each of those trades, right? Are you not trading enough to reach a point where you've paid $99 in a 30 day period?

Maybe, but they also make a truckload of money through intra-exchange trading fees. A few manipulated value swings with lots of volume could easily generate funds for MtGox that aren't traceable in the block chain.

From everything that I've read on the subject, the platform didn't exist before Mark's team was involved. 
MTGOX was intended as, but never used for, exchanging "Magic: The Gathering" cards because the infrastructure to actually use it as an exchange was never built out. The company didn't pivot from one technology to another -- because [there is no indication that they ever had anything more than the domain name in place](

If someone is a miner with a significant enough share of hash power that leaving Ghash.io would start to swing the needle, I'm going to make the assumption that they are familiar enough with software that "figuring out" how to point at a different pool isn't a solution -- they would have done it already.

For a large number of people, that was never presented as an option, at least in the past 6 months. Even if you knew something was coming and tried to get your BTC or fiat out, there is no indication it would have made much of a difference.
For the people who flocked to the site, recently, to take advantage of the (perceived) arbitrage opportunity, they have no excuse.
I don't want government regulation, mainly because Bitcoin is global -- any set of rules and regulation are going to be fractured and inefficient. If nothing changes and the common person's opinion of cryptocurrencies don't radically change, organically, the only way that Bitcoin will grow is if it's participants voluntarily come up with a standard of conduct and appropriately punish those who don't live up to that standard.
It's certainly not an easy or comfortable undertaking.

What problems did you run into with verification? I've been using VoS for a couple of months now, so maybe I got in before the process changed, but I don't recall anything out of the ordinary.

To those affected by each, a "bad investment is a bad investment" -- there are plenty of examples of people who had taken a gamble on a company that publicly trades and it fails, losing their funds. It's easy as putting in a buy order or attempting a trade on margin.

No, it's not that Mt. Gox lacks the liquidity to pay out those sellers, it's that for what ever reason, they've majorly cut back on the funds that are paid out. The money (should be) / (is there), it's just that they're either restricted in what they can pay out or chose not to pay it out.

Is it really "support" when they are being held captive? The fact that trade volume and a price for BTC still exists on Mt.Gox has far less to do with people's support for the exchange and more about the fact that they have **nothing else to do with the funds or coins stored there**.
If I had BTC or fiat trapped I'd be trading too, because it's unlikely that I'll ever see a penny of it again, so why not take a last ditch shot to maybe come out of this in the good if they actually do open things up in the future.

After reflection, your scenario makes a lot of sense. Even if everything is on the up-and-up, it's still something that people should approach with extreme caution.

No, Mt.Gox's actions killed Mt.Gox. There's a middle ground between complete market regulation and "self" regulation. The Bitcoin marketplace was unable to do anything in this case, because everyone but a few were kept in the dark.
If the marketplace demands transparency, and then doesn't reward companies who don't follow through with a general consensus, they won't exist. This is a market regulation that works, that doesn't care about localized political or legal issues, but instead, one that uses common sense and verifiably tech frameworks.

It's open source, so we can be reasonably confident that the Bitcoin isn't carrying malicious code. There's no guarantee that backdoors haven't been built into the base protocols or crypto, but if Bitcoin is affected, I would expect that there are LOTS of other things that would be affected, too.

If the draining of funds turns out go be true, it likely occurred over months or years. In that case, I presume that those funds are long gone, and distributed throughout the community.

Top-notch security and convenience aren't cheap for a vendor to provide, and given the difficulties that many crypto exchanges have had in the past couple of years, perhaps the higher trade fees are a worthwhile and necessary cost.
I've been using them for a while and never felt that I was paying too much, even when I was trading frequently. Then again, I also never worried about getting my funds out of VoS, either through crypto or fiat, so even if I had considered it expensive, the peace-of-mind that I had using the service (vs. my past experiences at BTC-e and MtGox) more than made up for the minor cost.
Your situation may be different though, so I can appreciate your concern.

People rationalized their problems in the past as "growing pains" and because they personally had not been too adversely affected, kept using Mt.Gox to trade.
A lot of people were probably in the situation of "I'll move these coins to my personal wallet tomorrow..." and just didn't follow-up on it because they trusted that because their coins were safe "yesterday and today", that "tomorrow" they would be ok, too. Unfortunately, when "tomorrow" came, it was too later for people to move coins off the exchange because they had already locked it down.

I presume that Mark Karpeles status in the community meant that he was on friendly terms with many other well-known people in the community. Mt.Gox may have been inept, but until very recently, there weren't many people accusing them of being fraudulent.

That's why a lot of big money was still there, because they figured they would never get burned.

I'll hone in on the last statement you made, because I think it brings up a very interesting topic:


There is a line of reasoning that states that if Satoshi's Bitcoins were to be moved, that it would have a destabilizing effect on the economy. I completely agree with that, if you finish the statement with "...and a large number of them were dumped on an exchange."
However, if only **some** of those coins were moved, what effect would that have? Lots of coins are bought and sold, daily, and the market does pretty well. Is the expectation that there would be a crisis of confidence because a portion of "Satoshi's stash" we're actually put into play? Do people care to the same degree if an early miner, or the Winklevosses started to divest their share?
Serious question, because it's both a potentially real scenario, and an interesting mental exercise.

@_date: 2014-02-20 15:16:50
I think this is the answer to what you're asking...
Assuming the best case, where Mt.Gox does open up withdrawals AND people are able to withdraw their BTC in full, if you have 10 BTC that you bought at $120/goxBTC, those BTC would be worth whatever the market rate is on the "outside". Now, that "outside" (or "real") price could be influenced if a lot of people attempt to sell those coins at once, but only time will tell.

Actually, from what I’ve read, consistently mining is less detrimental  to the cards’ physical condition versus using them for gaming. This is because the effects of thermal expansion on the overal life of electronics. Consistently running the cards at a constant draw and clock speed, as mining does, limits the times the chips heat up and cool down.
Not to say that all used cards are “safe”, only that a hard run mining card is potentially in better shape than a hard run gaming card.

You might as well report it as a capital loss and take advantage of the offset against that year's capital gains from other investments, or if you have no gains, take the $3k maximum deduction that year and carry any remaining losses forward to subsequent years.

You sound extremely confident in the technical implementation of your exchange. How do you know you haven't missed something?
Have you taken the same steps to ensure that your non-techincal infrastructure (human resources, trusted third-parties, etc.) won't become to conduit for an attack?

Signing this way would require the exchange to already have your other private key. If an automated system has access to it, you don't have control.

They do trade them in their internal accounting ledger, but with multisig, if you want to release funds you need x-of-y keys to sign the transaction. How would trades happen? It's not reasonable to have to reconcile every withdrawal from an account with a signature from every other account they've traded with from the time that they deposited that set of funds.

This would mean that your key would need to sign every trade after it was executed but before it was completed. Not very feasible with the standard "exchange" model.

But Shapeshift use(s)(d) BTER for part of its operations...so your suggestion has an obvious flaw.

That's certainly the hope, but only time will tell.

I'm not exactly sure how that would work without significantly impacting everyone who holds coins. Would you mind walking me through a hypothetical scenario where the network was resetting the block chain to avoid a massive, coordinated proof-of-work and proof-of-stake attack?

Because in the scenario that was presented, presumably a State-sponsored bad actor or international economic cartel, with the desire to dismantle cryptocurrencies is motivated to do that. 
The cost, today, of millions of dollars in outlay, to cripple a nascent technology that they expect will ultimately result in potentially trillions of dollars in damages, is a worthwhile opportunity cost.
