I don't want automatic backups, I want a device which can ~~either~~ ~~automatically~~ ~~generate~~ ~~a~~ ~~12-15~~ ~~word~~ ~~seed~~ ~~and~~ ~~let~~ ~~me~~ ~~write~~ ~~that~~ ~~down~~ ~~or~~ ~~even~~ ~~better~~ let me enter my own seed.

When you do that it automatically pulls your coins out of cold storage and distributes them among reddit. All of them.

I made a withdrawal from there 1 hour ago.

They really aren't.

Yeh spot on. I once (accidently) managed to create a transaction sending 1 billion bitcoins to my address which actually got sent out to the network, but sat there for days without confs until it was forgotten by most nodes.

    "Sir, your account has 51 cents of dollars in it"
    "Oh, so I'm rich then!"
    "No, it's 51 cents, not dollars"
    "So it's not dollars?"

Okay guys pack up the show, muffsponge does't like where we're taking this.

I am talking about control at the blockchain level, not some number on gox or coinbase or any other number not representitive of private keys in control by users.

Why post to reddit when you could be stealings satoshis millions

I put real coins on there a few weeks ago. Made a withdrawal and after 8 days my coins showed up back on my desktop wallet. Unfortunately no coinjoining had been done.

Electrum, set fee to zero in preferences and make sure you generally only spend coins that have been recieved at least a day or more before (age them a bit)

Dude just keep it for a while and make some money and you can make even more good happen.

Dude just tell them its a ledger of account balances maintained p2p rather than centrally, and that they can have unlimited account for free and can be the only one able to access their accounts.

    Samari87, follow these steps.
    Install the client at electrum.org. Bonus points of you install it while running a live usb. 
    Switch off internet.
    Open electrum, create a new wallet. Grab a piece of paper and a pen, and write down your 12 words. Memorize them. Write them down in two locations. MEMORIZE THEM. 
    Set a password if not running on live cd. 
    When wallet is open and seed is safely on paper, go to the Wallet menu in electum and click Master public key, then copy the key or save it to a a usb in a text file if on live usb.
    Once MPK is saved, if you are in a live cd shutdown and return to normal pc, else close electrum and delete your default_wallet file. linux its at /home/user/.electrum/wallets/default_wallet and if windows then you have to put up with nonsensical directory structure so I am sorry for your loss.
    Delete that default_wallet file. Proper linux delete, if windows do what you need to do to empty your bin or whatever.
    Then in your daily computer open electrum, create a new wallet but load from MPK. Now, with the knowledge that you have those 12 words you can safely send coins to any of the addresses in the recieve tab and be able to access them later. 
    To spend you get the option of keeping wallet in cold storage or not. To keep in cold you create a transaction in your daily, save the resultant unsigned tx to usb, transfer to an offline comp with your words restored in electrum, sign, transfer the tx back to online and either broadcast it in electrum or use blockchain.info/pushtx. Else if you don't mind those not being completely cold anymore, ignore everything above and just restore from your 12 words on your daily computer and just set a good pasword of 5 or more weird words. Set a good password.

Not to mention the unspendable coins in the blockchain
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:05:08
This is the idea behind displaying dollars in a blockchain.info wallet. Just click on your balance to switch between btc or currency.

It briefly existed, when they were 1:1.

It's is *incredibly* easily to run arch linux and keep Electrum up to date through the AUR.
