Who said anything about overtaking BTC?  It might, it might not.
The use case is minimising the time and cost of cross-border payments.  XRP is better at that than Bitcoin, at least for the time being.  Its fees are lower, and transaction times are quicker.  Liquidity might become an issue if XRP adoption grows, but for now?  Not really.  xRapid works by buying XRP from an exchange and selling it seconds later once the transaction is done.  It has zero net effect on supply and demand, so I don't really understand the liquidity argument.
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:17:58


Also you:


Anywho, why would slippage be a problem?  Why would the users of the xRapid software give two hoots about the value of XRP at any given time?  They just buy however much is needed at the time to carry the value of the transaction.  Given the minuscule time span between buying and selling, how much slippage do you expect there to be in that time?  The whole point is volatility *doesn't matter* when transaction times are that quick.

This is the labour theory of value, and it's basically a Marxist fallacy.  Value is a function of supply and demand.

What makes XRP special is that it has a well-defined use case and institutional adoption.  The folks here insisting it's a shitcoin or a scam are a prime example of what you're talking about.  Or maybe they really do know something I don't.
The XRP army hypes it up way beyond reason.  The negative attitudes people have towards XRP are probably in-part a reaction to that.  It's also the "banking coin", which irritates the cypherpunks and techno-anarchists who want banks to become obsolete.

As I understand it:
A problem with Bitcoin transaction is that they can take a long time to complete, and can have high fees, especially if network usage is high.  Lightning solves this by taking the transaction off the blockchain.
You set up a "payment channel" between yourself and the vendor.  This means you and the vendor agree to create a new off-chain ledger which will handle transactions.  You, the buyer, will put a certain amount of Bitcoin into this off-chain ledger, say 1BTC.  The ledger at this point says "the buyer is owed 1BTC, the vendor is owed 0BTC".  This initial set-up costs time and fees, because it's on the Bitcoin blockchain, but now you have this off-chain ledger with zero fees that can operate almost instantly.  
Whenever you buy something from that vendor, that transaction is done on the off-chain ledger.  Let's say you do 20 transactions of 0.01 BTC each.  After those 20 transactions, the off-chain ledger will say "the buyer is owed 0.8BTC, the vendor is owed 0.2BTC".  
Either party can close the payment channel at any time.  When this happens, the channel instructs the Bitcoin blockchain to carry out the appropriate transaction, in this case, sending 0.2 BTC to the vendor.  This means 20 transactions have been completed for the cost of 2.  
Lightning operates as a network.  So, if you have payment channels open with multiple different people, those people can do off-chain transactions with each other without having to open new payment channels.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:56:54
If someone is determined enough, they can open up a device, put it back together, and make it look like it hasn't been tampered with.  "Tamper-proofing" features can never be 100% effective, and the prospect of having access to large amounts of other people's cryptocurrency is one hell of an incentive.
Like I said, it might be fine, but it's just not worth the risk.  Imagine putting a small amount of Bitcoin in there, watching it grow to a life-changing amount of money, and then watching it vanish from your wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:44:13

I haven't seen any discussion about that, no.  Obviously, payment channels will eventually "run out" of Bitcoin and might need to be closed then.  I'm not sure if they can be "topped up"; maybe someone who knows more than me can say?  I also don't know how difficult it would be to set these channels up, or how widely adopted the system is.  Bitcoin is pretty complicated to begin with, what with having to set up a wallet and possibly having to sign up with multiple crypto exchanges.  Lightning is potentially an extra layer of complication, depending on how it is implemented.

I think people forget that when they actively trade, they're basically competing against everyone else who is actively trading.

If I may take a wild stab at what sfdvd...whatsisface is trying to say, whales can't keep dumping forever.  Eventually, they just run out.  At that point, they either have to replenish their supply of Bitcoin to stay in the market manipulating game, thus pushing the price back upwards, or they bow out.  Bitcoin that was once held by a single individual is now most likely held by more than one buyer, so the whale is replaced by... erm, some dolphins?

20k is the real FOMO moment, because that's when it's setting new all-time-highs.
At least, that's for retail FOMO. Institutional FOMO may have already started.

That last part is nonsense. If they intend to cash out at some point, that's their business, not yours. We'd all like to think Bitcoin is going to be the revolutionary new paradigm, but it might not work out that way, none of us can guarantee that.

You're mixing metaphors.  Ships have ports.  Trains have stations.
20k is when the general public will really start paying attention.  Everyone assumed (myself included, I'm afraid) that after it fell from 20k, it was all downhill from there.  Once it gets above the previous ATH, that's when everyone starts thinking "maybe it's only just getting started".  For now, I think if most people look at the chart, they'll draw a line from the ATH to the current price and see a downward slope.  Write off the latest rally as a "last gasp".

They don't need to buy up a huge amount.  Just a few tens of thousand would make them multimillionaires, and wouldn't affect the price much in the long term.

A Lambo is way more powerful than a Kia, and will be a lot more fun to drive.  They're also really nice to look at.  Kias are boring to look at.

Honestly, if you have no other retirement savings at age 40, I'd put most of it into something low-medium risk (ie, a typical retirement savings account), and put a portion into Bitcoin appropriate to your own risk appetite.  I think Bitcoin has a bright future, but I'm not so certain about it that I'd be willing to go all-in, or tell someone else to.  It's about as "high risk high reward" as investments get.
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:03:06
This is why I stopped using Coinbase, the instant they pulled this crap on me.  The fact that they just randomly decide to withhold delivery of the thing you just paid for, it's completely unacceptable and shady af.  Incidentally, it's also why I dream of a time where cryptocurrency is the normal way to buy things.
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:50:15
There isn't any.  But for institutional investors, they might see it as the least-bad option for storing value, because they expect the value of those other options to be even lower in the future.  If I understand correctly, it pretty much means anyone buying these is predicting a recession.
Also, I believe some funds, like pension funds, are required by law to have a certain percentage of their total assets in bonds.  Which is kinda fucked when you think about it, it's just more tax with extra steps.
@_date: 2019-09-15 21:12:21
About the same amount it takes to be a whale now.  The ability to impact the market has nothing to do with the USD valuation, it's what percentage of the total supply you have.

I've told a couple of people I own some Bitcoin, but I don't try to persuade them to do the same.  I think BTC is going to go up in value, but I might be wrong.  Even if I'm not, the price might drop 5%, they'll panic sell, and blame me for their loss.

Because even when you subtract out the volatility, the long term price trend is very strongly in the upwards direction.  Buying some Bitcoin is a bet that this trend, established for nearly a decade now, will continue; I think that's a good bet.

Don't let the naysayers get you down.  Nobody can say for sure whether the price is going to move up or down.  If it just keeps going upwards, and you wait for a correction that never comes, you'll wish you finalised your position sooner.
Personally, I think a dip is coming, but it won't be crazy low.  6k maybe, before climbing again.  Buying at 7.3k isn't optimal in that scenario, but hardly a disaster either.
