Sell walls are temporary and can be removed from 1 second to another. So yes it can be manipulation. It is an indicator and by no way should be trusted!

sell? iphone apps are not coins!

TL;DR your house burnt and you lost your hardware wallet as part of the damages? 
Not sure whether this is about "DON'T INVEST RECKLESSLY", otherwise you would never buy yourself anything physical either.
This is about hardware wallets vs online wallets, which are safer?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:32:27
Better 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:26:48
So we've got 1.5 more month to play with alts?

yep people should check their mails!

Is this potentially bad for cards like tenx or monaco?

And you just showed her parents how humble you are not. Also don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched.

Great find. Thanks for sharing! Made my Bitcoin year.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:02:54
This does not look very new if we think of gaming cheat programs such as wallhacks

Bitcoin is going to BOOM

Man I see that woman more than my girlfriend now
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:02:30
not much more I can do. Unless I sell so it goes up?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:48:19
Back to normal...

Sounds like playing poker without coins is not the same

Tbh the greed is the same
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:55:53
wow thanks I will set up Authy now. It also has desktop apps which I was looking for.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:01:00
Quick q, what's the tax rate on bitcoins in the US? Let's say if you made 1k, 10k, 100k or more this year?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:52:43
just what I needed to know
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:00:46
lol yes
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:52:14
Beware! All my friends are buying bitcoins

It's good to see Switzerland is on our side!

Apparently this H&amp;S thing is no more, but let's see

Someone needs to create Bitcoin Full Stop.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:15:21
I found the antidote 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:40:26
1. We kind of already have this in the US/Europe. In most cases people provide their identity and don't mind doing so.
2. I don't think we are here to a) not pay tax b) use bitcoin for illegal purposes, because we know that Bitcoin is not anonymous (see 1.) nor untraceable.
This doesn't look like bad news to me.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:03:35
Don't brag.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:36:17
forget about this 2x/dec28 thing, been searching about it for hours today and it seems to be fake news
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:48:43
It's either BTCers thinking I'm promoting BCH or it's BCHers at it again :). But I'm all in BTC
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:45:24
I'm lost. I can't find any link between LBTC and S2x, can you? 
However I saw this about S2x on Hit BTC 


Also is it related to the current thread "segwit"? I don't know.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:46:33
Well it could crash and people would still speak about it
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:10:53

so reassuring to see comments like yours
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:08:22
I love this
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:49:21
BTC vs. BCH, only one is expected to survive. So this is half a gift.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:27:26
Well things were crashing before that. South Korea just added up.
The reason it is crashing more than it should seem obvious when we read through this subreddit. It looks like most people need to secure some money right now, mainly to pay their university loans, help their family or buy whatever they dreamt to buy. Good for them, they came to grab a bit/a lot of money, they won/lost, they left.
To many others (korean people included), Bitcoin is more than that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:56:26
Yep. segwit2x was cancelled in November. Today no one really talks about it apart from "a segwit2x" itself  &lt;- to apparently not believe, no exchanges will do anything about it on dec. 28th, unless I got it all wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:50:48
Can you please screen/copy paste for me? 
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:45:49
It's not wall street you are trading against... it's just your neighbour who is selling apples at a lower price because people didn't like apples too much recently.
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:50:08
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:51:50
good answer/question
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:31:09
Google it, but also visit the correct websites for BTC. Careful of the rest/scams 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:03:52
When was the fork again?
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:40:19
The past is not the future
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:20:28
The answer I wanted
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:01:57
Buying BTC is the first step, otherwise just buy stuff using dollars innit

Cannabis is not legal (everywhere) and yet people use it, love it, respect it, know what it's worth. We don't need Trump's advice. Same thing.

Always thought that exact same post but was unproductive enough to not post it! 
So the idea is that we should expect bitcoin to idle for some time?
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:12:05
no and no
