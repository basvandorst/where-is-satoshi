In my country, Bitcoin is by law not a currency or a "financial instrument." Any profit made from capital gains is therefore not taxed. If my investment rises to $1,000,000 (I wish), I would not have to pay a single cent in taxes.

The sizes of the words depend on how many times in the whitepaper they appear. The infinity sign appears only once, yet it is larger on the image than expected, so there is definitely something to the infinity sign.

"0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12" are also BIP39 seed words (zero, one, two...). Maybe something to it, maybe not. Next to the cross is also "257" which doesn't appear in the whitepaper, but [7][2][5], maybe the 257th word in the BIP39 wordlist, "cactus," is the checksum (When you are close to home, X marks the spot.)
"Try +1" and then "-1" clues: not sure about the word "try", but I guess one less step (no additional passphrase/word to look for, therefore a new address).

An exception where the developers left an embedded password by mistake in a single model phone 3 years ago, and a poorly programmed Samsung baseband that might read the phone storage, yet there is no evidence of someone being able to do it remotely, and even then, it does not have root access, but it works under the "radio" user (except for one model).

Oh. I didn't think it would be so difficult when I thought about it... So I guess obfuscating/encrypting the QR code in this way by breaking it into pieces and putting it back together with some passphrase mechanism would be more secure than BIP38? Or at least more labour-intensive (assuming you only have the QR code and no address)?

You can copy either .wallet or .key, doesn't make a difference. Except if you copy .wallet you'll always need to use MultiBit, but you could import the .key into any other wallet app. And if you manually make any new receiving addresses after you've made a copy, you'll need to update the copy.

Not sure about the two "s" in "weaknesses," but "257" and "∞" were clearly not automatically generated like the rest. There is no "257" in the whitepaper, "[7][2][5]" is, so the author scrambled them for a reason and put next to the [X] spot. The infinity sign ∞ appears only once in the whitepaper, yet it is larger than expected in the image, so the author increased it for a reason and maybe moved too.

I randomly selected 4 blocks in the image in Photoshop, and inverted them horizontally or vertically or both. After the first two inverts (or maybe it was one, can't remember), it could still be scanned correctly due to the QR code's error correction. So it would actually take only 2 (or 3) modifications to find the private key.

Because you need to use a script and input your seed words into a computer to derive the entropy hex and reversely to build the mnemonic, with this you can do it manually (e.g. by printing the entire mapping_table.txt), plus it's an additional security measure since you're not directly storing your private key, seed words or entropy. And also there is no invalid entropy, if you wrote "A" instead of "4" by mistake that will derive a different key and you'll unlikely brute-force the correct entropy, but writing a Unicode codepoint wrong, e.g. "AEAE" instead of "4EAE" will result in a Unicode character not present in the Traditional Chinese BIP-39 wordlist, and you could guess where you made a mistake by comparing the other 3 characters of the codepoint to the wordlist's codepoints for example.
Edit: I also made a [script]( to convert the seed words to entropy hex and vice versa if someone wants it, requires "pip install mnemonic" (by TREZOR).

Only if the custom ROMs are official releases, and not ports by shady and anonymous XDA members. And even then, you need your device rooted to install a custom ROM, so a stock and unrooted device is still safer than an open-source custom ROM that requires root. The chance of an attacker finding a 0-day in proprietary software limited to one model or two and exploiting it to steal your bitcoins is practically nil, unlike malware with root access.

I can envision a robber pointing a gun at you, ordering you to open your phone wallet on some future $1000 smartphone and sending him all your BTC, not taking the phone at all.
That's why you should always have a separate wallet with a small amount of funds on your phone.
Although, I can see them breaking into your house and pointing a gun at you, ordering you to turn on your PC and sending them all your BTC.
I never thought of that, actually. This is quite scary. Will bitcoin raise the number of home invasions and robberies? Or even the sale of firearms for protection from these future criminals?

Do you check the URL of every single new tab you open, especially if the website looks like exactly what you'd expect it to look like? I didn't think so, or you have OCD.

This is how you can pay for a bus ticket over here (they don't take dirty fiat any more, only bus card or this): you board the bus, you call a certain number with your phone, the carrier starts emitting this sound, you push your phone against the machine in the bus, which verifies the call, and you get an SMS with the bus ticket.
How long before I can pay with bitcoin like that is what I'd like to know.

I never saw Google ads that were images before. It was text, you could copy-paste the text. The URL was correct, so when you clicked the link it redirected to the phishing site that looked just like blockchain.info. And who checks their URL address every time they open something in a new tab, especially when the URL clearly said blockchain.info in the ad, and the website looks just like the original?
@_date: 2014-06-08 10:24:22
A person can advertise his product and make the URL be "google.com," "microsoft.com," "apple.com," etc.
That's plain stupid and irresponsible.

Which get converted to USD with shitty exchange rates, this can delay the process for a day longer, not to mention seeing your balance in shitty dollars instead of euros is annoying.

No, it's strictly a matter of not letting advertisers to enter the URL address manually. Is your product/service hosted on x.com? The URL address will automatically be set to x.com, and not allow you change the URL address displayed to y.com.
The fact they allow this is ridiculous.
It's not incorrect, this is exactly what happened here with blockchain.info and the ad is **still** being served.




Funny how they don't actually make an automated check for this, they just assume you'll be honest about it. Stupid and irresponsible.

Those would be standard money-laundering prevention laws. It is up to an organisation itself (bank, exchange, whatever) to devise its AML policies, evaluate the risk factors and build the appropriate KYC (they could ask you to take a photo of yourself with a chicken under your arm if they wanted to - it's entirely up to an organisation at hand). What these risk factors are is not made public for obvious reasons, so you will not get a response from BitStamp explaining why some individuals get these KYC questions. The fact of the matter is, people got/get these checks when **depositing** fiat as well, something a scamming company would not do. As for why don't they ask the KYC questions before depositing/withdrawing bitcoins: because bitcoins are not regulated by the AML, money is, and the KYC checks must according to law be done before a money transaction happens.
Just answer the KYC questions and you're free to withdraw/deposit any fucking sum of money you want. Butthurt criminals and drug dealers are SOL at BitStamp, and rightfully so. Go trade at BTC-E or something.

If your Android is rooted, then the security of iOS owns the ever loving shit out of Android. Any Android app/malware with root can steal your private key, good luck doing that on iOS.
There are pros and cons with both.

Well, I did that for fun just now. The font is named differently (Times-Roman vs TimesNewRomanPSMT), the size is also different (11 vs 11.3). It also has its own margin not shared with the rest of the document. Replacing "Roger" with "Ooger" still leaves it neatly aligned with the line like the rest of the document. This means the v8 line was definitely added in with some other application on a different system than v7.
If this means anything, or if it's relevant at all at this time, I don't know, as I haven't been following the Ver-OKCoin drama.

If their old bank account is closed, the bank will reject it, and you'll get the money returned usually within 7 days. Maybe it takes longer for international transfers.

Simple solution. Pure idiocy not to implement it.

Yes, but malware can be any previously legit app that went rogue. Adblock app author could one day decide to become evil and, already having root, update the app to steal the keys.

I just learnt that the import private key bug could only manifest when trying to import blockchain.info private keys in the custom format blockchain.info exports them. That is why they removed this function from MultiBit. You can safely import/sweep any private key in the standard WIF format into MultiBit and there won't be any issues whatsoever. So to import blockchain.info private keys safely, you either have to convert it to the standard WIF format first, or use a tool like [this]( But again, the authors don't recommend importing unless necessary.
Also, the bitcointalk.org thread you linked above is the same as the reddit thread I linked in my post above.
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:04:49
Blockchain.info shows this when you hover over with the mouse.
They also have this in the Android app, but it's broken since the start and never worked to begin with. It's been months; fix that shit, BCI.

Sounds like this: 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:54:39
[Link]( though to be fair, that bug was due to importing a blockchain.info private key, something the authors don't recommend and even say you shouldn't do it.
On the other hand, there is a [recent bug issue]( where a user got bitcoin sent to an invalid change address where they cannot be spent. The authors made a forensics report and posted a [blog]( where they claim the user likely imported an invalid private key in April 2014, but the user [claims]( he installed MultiBit for the first time in October 2014. Can't say who's right without seeing the logs and timestamps, but if the MultiBit developers are right, this is once again an import issue, something they do not recommend doing.
Other than the above import issues, there are no other "bugs" in MultiBit, unless this last case wasn't the result of an invalid private key import, but we'd need to see the logs to be sure.
