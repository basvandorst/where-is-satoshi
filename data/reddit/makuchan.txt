it's **definitely** going to go under 1k, go buy bitcoins with all your money.i know this because i am god
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:59:39
No, that's one of the beauties about bitcoins. All transactions are final.
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:00:49
looking forward for the next time bitcoin "dies"
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:38:07
but isn't it important for BTC to be usable for lower value transactions? like buying ice cream, it would be kinda silly paying 2$ for the fee and 1$ for the ice cream?

buy the dip m8
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:11:58

@_date: 2017-05-26 17:27:58
you should go back to playing COD or some shit 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:04:31
enjoy the regrets in the next days when it goes back to 3k$+ ;)
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:00:00
fuck the police, i'm buying now
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:00:38
no one ever said that tho? if you're talking about the exchange rate
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:20:33
imagine the low odds of such find, but then also the odds of the wallet not being encrypted?
yeah, probably not. almost definitely not!

Dude, are you crazy? This will easily go to 0.20$ per btc in few minutes. RIP Bitcoin, it was fun while it lasted.
   
Honestly, anyone listening to ANYONE in this thread does not belong here.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:51:30
and, still waiting?

so I see Electrum supports RBF, tried to resend my coins but if I got it right it doesn't work this way - the original transaction has to be sent with RBF too.
         
tried broadcasting the transaction with a higher fee on coinbin, and i'm getting the "258: txn-mempool-conflict" error.
    
i'm so frustrated now, tried pretty much everything and nothing works... fucking multibit sent a 20 cent fee for some reason (even if i always check it to be the recommended fee)
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:59:59
All these fucking manipulaiton/troll posts, yeah go sell all your bitcoins because it will totally fall to 1000€ tomorrow!!! Fucking idiots, use your own brain and don't make these manipulators profit just because you panic and panic even more because of these comments. 
        
This is a classic dip. Buy it, or go ahead and panic sell all your coins. This won't go far beyond 2000, we'll be back at 2500-3000 soon.

I have a transaction that is pending for 8 days now. What can I do? The transaction accelerator is always over the limit (been trying for hours and hours every 10 mins) and i've tried exporting the private key to another wallet, I wish there would be a beginner-friendly method for resending unconfirmed transactions with a higher fee..
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:03:05
even 200 is high lol, this time bitcoin is dead m8. rip
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:39:29
if you don't own the private key, you don't own the bitcoins
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:41:27
If you want to send 20 dollars to someone, you type 20 dollars in the amount box (of your wallet), and then send it. You don't need to calculate it yourself. What's the problem?

@_date: 2017-06-12 17:44:04
panicking, people getting manipulated by the eth hype, selling their btc. lets see how far it drops, i'd  buy more at 2.2-2.3k and HODL
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:44:50
I remember people saying this at 350-400$
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:25:00
Yeah, yeah, sure. See you at 10,000$.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:50:17
don't listen to that guy - don't be that desperate and naive thinking ethereum will come anywhere close to bitcoin (and especially don't think you'll become rich just because some random guy on reddit is spamming "buy it now men")
