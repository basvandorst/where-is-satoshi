Rainy days happen, at least you had sense enough to try to save for it! 
All the best to you and yours.

Simply put, don’t give THEM your money when you can let us lend off the back of it while it’s in your bank!

Sounds like such a small amount to those who have plenty but the same could be said about fiat. Be a good person and the rest will come, all aboard the karma train!

Nicely done, remember to pay it forward, help make the world a better place.

Long term goals is what you set up here, also when you’re ready to upgrade you will make back on the original physical assets by selling them on.
Don’t sweat the technique.

I have an alt coin but would still like to wish you all well in your current coin successes. We all share a similar dream I think, it’s good to see yours being realised

I imagine most people will keep that info close to their chests but I’m also sure you will get a varied response. I would say, also as a novice is to look at the least volatile coins and look at their team and vision.
There are at least 2 I’m thinking of inparticular but simply be prepared to diversify with money you’re ok with potentially losing. Also some tokens cannot be held in certain wallets so look around.
Physical storage options are good for more protection and control such as the ledger nano s.
It also depends on how much you want to diversify with and if you are intending to hold etc

Coinbase is bigger than some people realise, they won’t be going anywhere for a while unless they are done for fraud, and I doubt that when fees are already so high to help them make enough from small time investors.

Be wary of spoof emails lately from cöinbase also.
The ö in the name gives it away but a few people got caught out this week. Be smart.

I don’t know about the claim most people hold 1 btc or less. I’ve seen some pretty tasty tips from generous people on here that prove otherwise.

Ha! Horrible that’s how I feel. I remember this way back when and seriously thinking there was little to lose. Old me was right and now older me feels silly.

The world went and got itself into a big damn hurry.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:20:23
I will answer you, just leave it, don’t sweat over a stake like that, it’s already there and you can watch it grow.

There are other alt coins which are much less that you could look into also, every coin has to start somewhere, good luck

$10 free you say?
How so?
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:55:13
Good: easy to set up, been around a long time, quick if using credit card.
Bad: pretty high fees, only 3 coins can be held on the change that are crypto, slow transaction times moving btc sometimes.

Try here for the fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:35:08
Made me chuckle. 
I love the sense of community this has brought to so many though. If only more RL was like this huh?
Good luck!

Yeah I think that’s referral money, thanks for getting back to me though, it is appreciated.
