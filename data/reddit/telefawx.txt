So why do those in charge of BTC want to make it a “digital gold” that no one transacts, ruining the one use case? Surely they realize it’s better to make 0.01% transaction fees on billions of transactions instead of 3% on zero transactions? Right?

I mean it's still just Delta hedging, right? They are longing volatility. To make any money in Delta hedging, you gotta be really levered.

If I have $80 dollars today... and I buy $40 worth of bitcoin... so I'm left with $40 of bitcoin and $40 of USD, why wouldn't I just buy that gas with USD, and then a month later that $40 of bitcoin becomes worth $50 of USD, convert my bitcoin back to USD and then I can buy another tank of gas for $40 and have $10 leftover.

If bitcoin is valuable and stable, why would I spend it? Shouldn't I just hoard it and spend my worthless and unstable USD on it?

China is the perfect breeding ground for bitcoin adoption. Which is why I personally view bitcoin as a commodity until China completely industrializes and stops manipulating the yuan.

I've heard that places like Dubai and Abu Dhabi "appearing" overnight was large in part to money laundering.

Gold and bitcoin are assets. You can invest in any kind of asset. In fact, commodities and other similar assets that don't typically pay a yield are often used to hedge other investments that do. If you're purchasing an asset as a part of your investment strategy, it's safe to say you're investing in it.
I think you're making some distinction that's kind of unimportant. I get what you're saying, but I wouldn't get lost in the minutia. You see many crpyto advocates claim to be experts on this stuff when they throw around such advanced terms like "store of value". This is a common tactic for anyone that's faking it til they make it, regardless of the subject. They latch on to certain terms and talk down to others they think don't understand them, or try and catch people that aren't aware of trivial nuance, using their stock explanation of said nuance to show "expertise" on the subject. It's the "um ackshually" phenomenon. Don't be annoyed by dorks that do that, and don't play that game either, which I think you're flirting with. 
Don't mean to offend by this in any way, just giving you my two cents.

So you’re saying the stock market should be at the same level as before Trump was elected because the average investor is dumb?

It’s not about negative correlation, that’s almost impossible, rather just being non correlated and having low positive correlation. 
If you’re cost average buying, just putting a small percentage in to a different asset with very low correlation, can yield a higher overall return, even if the expected return of that different asset is lower.

So the economists are only wrong about the last three years because everyone else is stupid?

Gatekeepers are 100% a problem, but eliminating the central bank “gatekeepers” that can inflate away your ability to save is still progress. Cryptocurrency, even via Coinbase, eliminates a Central Bank’s ability to control the medium of exchange. Coinbase doesn’t have this ability.

Your average schmuck might not make it worth it, but bigger money holders with automatic buy orders might make it worth it. Even if the pump and dump only nets this person 10%, that’s still $10 million in a week.

Same.
