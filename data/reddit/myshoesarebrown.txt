Since you can't predict the lows, even better would be to see the weighted yearly average by year. Anyone want to make this graph for us to show the naysayers?

ABDCA: Always Be Dollar Cost Averaging

If you're investing more than $1200 per month, DCA every week. $600, every 2 weeks. CB and Gemini fees become cost effective for recurrent buys when you buy more than $300 at a time. Check out the fee schedule for more info.

I'm thinking of switching over from coinbase to gemini. Does gemini support bitcoin purchases prior to actually funding your account? On coinbase, I was able to set up a recurring buy without any funds actually deposited in coinbase and then coinbase would then debit my bank account once the purchase was made. Does gemini support the same type of transaction?

If Bitcoin security can't keep up with quantum computing, then we have bigger problems than just getting your keys hacked

Buy Bitcoin if you think its ROI is higher than the ROI of other assets currently available.

Read my first post. Take profits to live a life worth living. Of course I'm going to take profits. The hope though is that Bitcoin will replace Fiat and we won't have to "take profits" in that traditional sense. That's what most HODLers are in the game for.

Take some profits if you need it to live a life worth living, but don't start day trading as an alternative to HODLing. 99% of people lose out on long term gains by trying to time the market.

Invest in security to protect your investment. Hardware wallets with your seed on a metal plate in a safety deposit box. But you shouldn't be doing any of that until your investment is big enough in value to justify it (ie don't spend $60 a year on a safety deposit box for $100 of Bitcoin).

DCA n' Chill

For 1 person to make money day trading, at least 1 other person has to lose money day trading. What usually happens is that 1 person makes a lot day trading for every 90 people or so losing a little each before giving up. The only way everyone can make money is by HODLing, if you assume the intrinsic value of the asset will increase.

The banking industry can die a slow death with the gradual rise of personal crypto banking. It doesn't have to be some sudden collapse, and I don't think anyone here is hoping for that scenario.

Governments (and therefore big money) control Fiat. The people control bitcoin. Which do you think will benefit the people in the long run?

I hope you're being facetious lol

The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. Unless the demand for Bitcoin goes up or the supply goes down (which it doesn't, for all intents and purposes), then the price doesn't increase.

Does anyone have any suggestions on platforms that allow recurrent buys? I currently have a recurrent weekly buy on coinbase in order to DCA and not be tempted to time the market. I'm not super excited about the fees on coinbase but it's the only place I've found that has the recurrent buy feature.

I definitely think we are seeing a cascade effect from highly leveraged accounts being liquidated one after another
