Then Bill would have access to all funds of Bob.
The procedures in place: mathematics, especially probability.
The probability of that happening is like winning the lottery 3 times in a row, getting hit by lightning twice and getting your arm biten off by a shark while swimming in your pool, all occuring within one week.

I had to use IDnow twice already, once at a bitcoin broker and once at a online bank.
They use video chat to verify your identity, especially looking at the documents under angles to detect fake ones.
They sell this service (to verify your identity) to all kind of businesses that need KYC.

You lost 25% of your Bitcoin?
So you had 2 Bitcoins, and now you have 1.5?

According to  only bitfinex does as of now.
You can put in feature requests at your favorite exchanges and hope though.

Wasn't Gemalto hacked by NSA and GCHQ?

no, the miner has to find a hash, that starts out with - like now - 18 zeros.
so SHA(prev hash, transactions, timestamp, x) has to start with 000000000000000000
if it starts with e00000000000000000 - nope.
if it starts with 000000000000001000 - nope.
like the just found block - it's hash is 000000000000000000e2fcdc16360bb14b6f658dfab2af4f1ee68c01405e175d, so it fits.
edit: note - this is a little simplified for explaination purposes. the number of zeros counts in binary representation, the standard nonce is probably not enough to change (look up extra nonce, coinbase text)...

the hash has to start with a lot of zeros. the more zeros at the beginning, the more difficult it is to find the hash that fits. the number of zeros needed increases over time.
you have the hash of the last block, and the transactions, and then you change the nonce, until you have a fitting hash. this could take billions of guesses. once you have one that fits, you have a block. this does not mean, that this is the only nonce, that would have fit. it is just the one you found. 
next block has to include your hash, the new transactions, and find a new fitting hash with a nonce.
