Right which defeats the purpose of the blockchain to begin with.
This is what happens when really smart people do things without the guidance of business people. 
Yeah sure it's fast blah blah but it's not practical, and crypto is hard enough to understand for normies. 
It reminds me of this:
Just put the bitcoin inside of another medium so you can transact faster... lol wtf.

Consumers aren't going to like it.
Yeah maybe great for a few applications but not most consumer oriented ones. 
Again nerds did this that don't understand business. It's a band aid solution. 
Plus lolz for the downvotes on my post. ITS NOT A DISAGREE BUTTON. Learn to reddit.

Practically speaking it doesn't work.
No one wants to keep a "payment channel" open to transact etc.

If the government decides to heavily regulate bitcoin or make it illegal then it's game over. Yeah a private citizen can use it on a VPN, but companies won't touch it.
China I believe already did?

Newsflash: They are all shitcoins. 
No one is using BTC to buy anything.

You might be right about this... Lightning Network is cumbersome. All it will take is the Facebook to show up and then that's it...
