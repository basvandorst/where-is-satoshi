From what I understand from Islamic scriptures, only God can create wealth and distribute it (gold and silver / dinar and dirham), which also makes their current fiat currency haram.
They are just using religion to outlaw bitcoin as they cannot control it or the people using it, so they use the oldest method in the book (control people using religion).
Keep using bitcoin.

The average Joe falls for it so they keep spinning the wheel.

This. Employees in the service sector get paid well here and it is their duty to give great service without expecting a tip. The issue with tipping is that the 90 percent who don't tip, end up getting subpar service.

Tipping culture is non-existent here. Employees get paid well.

That is considered a tip but donation / charity / helping hand. Labourers don't render any direct service to me so I can't directly tip. Albeit, a hand out every now and then when passing by a construction zone. They have my respect.

I appreciate that but I stopped tipping since most service workers have an entitled mentality here and start treating you subpar if you forget to tip them even once. The facial expressions show dissapointment. They also start asking for more money as loans or gifts. I'd rather send my money to real needy peeps in Africa.

LOL in UAE I walk into my bank and ask to withdraw 7 digits+ and no one bats an eye. Instead, they serve me hot drinks while I wait.

No strip clubs here sadly. For that, I take a flight out.
