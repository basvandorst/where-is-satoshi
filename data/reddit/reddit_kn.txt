 IPOs MFs Insurance and bankers run by politicians'  black money market may be finding new resort following queen. Hope they get charged heavy fees

that may or may not be a good idea -leave it to customer. But banks dictating and using it as a fake news to all public is what i reject.

looks like govt has paid a mod here
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:27:29
This is exactly why Nourini was paid for to spread harm. You were able to afford but think about those who cannot handle FUD?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:14:40
Depends on moving average. But if some wallstreet jewish cartels join with their corrupt puppet counterparts in india ( brahmin bankers) and europe banks ( largely under govts and swiss havens )  to convince bait the pretending weak hodlers to sell their modesty for more profits it may fall further.
Last few days they did the same with buffet, nourini and jaitley spreading FUD in rest of asia.

and you garbage collector? Atleast do it properly
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:49:50
Power to control BTC ? No way.
They should only ban banking cartels, fakers and wallstreet whales from trading it and creating shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:33:25
I agree ICOs need regulation. Bounty APIs can be misused or hacked. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:59:42
Ah Indi English!! ��
500 rupee notes were illegal in India a year back . Govt itself spread greatest FUD of all times and printed even more notes within  a year. By that logic Bitcoins will be mined more and more . 
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:07:34
I wonder if exchanges verify anonymous swiss(if thats what you mean) accts . Rest should be fine.
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:55:10
looks like kid jewish cartel.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:47:17
crypto or btc is first digital currency. There is solid base of millions of people who want to use it as only currency. Speciality is no borders no central authority truly international, very little fees.  Since its digital a whole organisation can be opened which ate nothing but ICOs very easily without any fees to anyone.
Over that as every currency  gamblers gamble bet and speculate. This is just a fraction and not majority.
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:25:34
The government is as corrupt as ever and now shameless.  Few days back govt was spreading FUD and now look how they have struck a deal with these high priced exchanges acting like pimps to government as soon as they smell profit.
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:15:50
Hope they wont come up with "promised property" for chosen ones ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:22:45
crypto algorithms : open source
mining software : open source 
Ico platforms : open source
who will regulate : open source technology
as simple as that. in software terminology scams are equivalent to bugs which is fixed in every release.
I agree market will learn but we can definitely shorten learning curve.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:45:08
Just read abt a binational wedding which has already happened in 2014 on blockchain without bureaucratic gridlock.  
You have very valid idea. I am not sure if there is already ICO for IPR (which currently is heavily biased with US govt approval ) .
For content there is STEEM but not sure if it meets all that you have stated. Maybe you can fork.
Having said that I also hope to travel on blockchain ��
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:44:01
As soon as btc clears 11k wallstreet dogs get unleashed .pure FUD
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:28:14
That confirms you :D
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:37:33
prices have doubled if not tripled.  a govt worker spotted
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:15:10
They are pathetically paid to create fake accounts of crypto founders and tweet like "if you send me 0.2 i will send 2". founders are not blocking them either! Not to forget huge ICO scam trolls on FB. And FUD sympathisers here on reddit
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:07:31
Faker spotted
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:41:30
Its a systemic fraud of roundtrip the forex makes from rupee to its pegged currency which made Ambani in day trading , Murthys Nilekanis in IT arbitrage cheap labor and bankers ( sbi axis icici) through forex and hedges insurance richest. Just that now cryptos probably have caught fraud.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:38:53
banks are shared speculators. The money they have isnt their's either . Bankers are sole reaso  why top 1% concentrate wealth illegally including Queen.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:52:43
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:50:11
trade and ico platforms are banned. So they can still buy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:17:39
For them only Vijay Mallya is legal
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:49:04
well it's decpetive. its blanket ban on crypto ads. one can still see rummy circle, sports betting, paid news ads and many more scams in the selective cleanup process.  A weekly biased fake news - enough for 10% drop!
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:50:48
just a matter of time before btc replaces currency
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:01:04
O well there is one HNC indeed!
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:54:32
The support price or SMA is very close currently. Price is stable. So its prob the best time. But make sure you invest only the amount ready to hold it till atleast one complete cycle or year.
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:47:05
Call that Nourini now.

FUD panic spread by Finance minister while not acting on real scammer -who sits in parliament
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:18:00
Indian banks are stopping tv channels from airing biggest(yet) bank fraudster who shares same name as Modi as well as spamming facebook and twitter india trends.
Not to mention buffet and nourini.

Its not regulating coins just the ICOs. If a banker wants to disrupt market he first tries with governments, then hires a silicon valley guy ,  makes a exciting white paper, puts bounty share greater than seed investment in a closed loop. They scam social media. People sell btc to buy these coins. Closed loop sells immediately after ICO launch. prices drop all investors lose. Do it multiple times a week and BTC crashes. Next goto market tell amd nvidia to stop selling graphic cards. Reduce workers. There you go again altcoin mkt crash due to clogging and gas. 
In spite of all these the open source community is sweating hard with mining and algorithms.
Workers need to unitedly create consensus to regulate scams not by goverment but by technology itself. For example a limit can be placed in ICO software that regulates bounty limit and  immediate selling by closed loops.

cryptocurrencies i said. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:12:30
True . speculation and betting was not part of bitcoin ideology. Exchanges brought them. We need to mine crypto without wallstreet sharks baking them in speculative furnaces.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:58:08
yes can be done. 
well , coming to wikileaks internet is its blockchain as its goal is to be free for all.
