I never said anyone gets spontaneously richer but it's a fact that a significant percent of the wealthiest people are only wealthy by the grace of inheritance. The idea that the only way to be wealthy in capitalism is to be the most competent is absurd.
And your argument about wealth not equaling power only works by limiting the definition of power.

Not technically correct in that an ewallet is not a bank and since the terminology is still ewallet calling it a wallet is still more correct than calling it a bank.
And a lot of subreddits have rules against posting solely to market. I don't think it's a good precedent to have blatant ad copy as top posts.

Why does the betting close a few days before the results? If the price isn't at all close to $1000 or is well over $1000 people can bet with nearly absolute certainty.

What qualifies as massively cheaper? How are you determining the cost?

With fiat you can also choose how you store your money. And there's already been fractional reserves with Bitcoin.

Is this cost effective over using a print on demand service? It seems like it would take a lot of time for each copy.

I'm with you. It sucks you can't keep up with Bitcoin on Reddit without also taking part in @_date: 2014-03-21 13:40:57
To me, once the advantages of a crypto-currency becomes relevant to the average Western consumer, what's stopping countries from creating their own currencies? For a lot of people here the lack of regulation is a key selling point, but I feel for your average consumer they would feel more comfortable knowing there's protection in place. If the US came out with their own crypto-currency, it might quickly gain more traction.

For me the biggest pro for using a credit card vs using bitcoin is I feel much more secure having a recourse for fraudulent purchases, and being confident in the value of a dollar being stable from one week to the next.

To recruit people you have to offer some motivation for using it. Most people aren't going to care about the merits of a decentralized currency. Right now one of the biggest draws of Bitcoin are speculative purchases, but those people aren't using the coins. The only thing I can think of to attract people is for businesses to offer lower prices for Bitcoin.

Cash is for showoffs too.
Look me using a medium of exchange instead of bartering goods! 
God, get over yourself.

If there's no immediate benefit very few people will be motivated to utilize it. The average person isn't going to put the time into understanding and using Bitcoin because of some hypothetical future where things are 1-5% cheaper.

Even if the son slips from being the absolute best producer of oranges and is only second or third best, his odds of having more power in society is much better than a genius born into poverty. He only needs to be competent enough to hire a more competent person to run it for him. It takes much more competence to create wealth from nothing than to maintain wealth. Even a poorly run company can last for many years if it is entrenched enough. Long enough for another generation of people to have power by birth. The consolidation of wealth in capitalism is in no way inherently merit-based. There's a myriad of opportunities by luck that make it easier for certain people to acquire and consolidate wealth. Of two equally competent orange growers the one with a successful father is much more likely to be successful.
Even if it were inherently merit based, why does a small group of the most competent in a certain skillset (business) deserve to have the more power than the collective of millions? Even if their position is by the measure of competence, it does not solve the problem of a few people manipulating the system to the expense of many.

Neither of those are compelling reasons for anyone I know to adopt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:34:03
None of my day to day purchases accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:50:15
I don't speak any of those languages. I'm not arguing that there shouldn't be inheritance I'm arguing against the idea that in capitalism only competent people will be able to consolidate wealth.
And your point about wealth and power isn't very good. Just because it doesn't lead to absolute power doesn't mean it doesn't come with power. If I'm one of the wealthiest people in the world I can own a large percentage of media channels and use it to influence public opinion. I can use it to align myself with people with positions of authority and influence their decisions. I can use it to evade the judicial system.

Using Bitcoin requires an amount of technological connectivity. I don't think it's absurd for it not to be well suited for a century old technology. Even now I very, very rarely complete a transaction over the phone, and if I do 90% of the time it's just for takeout (which can be done online for the most part).

While it's good to save as opposed to not save, it's a terrible idea to put all your savings into Bitcoin. You should have a more liquid emergency fund as well as more diverse long term investments.

You're talking about colloquial language though that doesn't really cause confusion. My bank's online interface calls itself a "virtual wallet," which is obviously very different than my physical wallet which is very different from a bitcoin address and key. But people understand it as, "this thing holds money." This post reads like ad copy, not a semantic concern, especially when you throw your Twitter link in here.

Or your dad was the best at growing oranges.

He's attempting to market his service. If you want to get technical the definition of a wallet is a pocket sized booklet for holding paper money and coins. A USB drive with your bit address and key isn't a wallet. A peice of paper isn't a wallet. The semantics that OP is highlighting is completely arbitrary and anyone who spends time in this community is well aware of the associated risks of how you manage your bitcoins. OP just created a catchy sound bite

The main reason is using Bitcoins doesn't offer the average person any concrete reward over using established currencies and methods of transaction. If 99% of my purchases are either local or through sites like Amazon, how is using Bitcoins going to offer an immediate, practical benefit?

Nothing in those reports show that credit cards are massively more expensive than other forms of payment. It actually shows that cards are cheaper than cash and debit cards are cheaper than credit cards. Sweden actually spends more on credit than any other European country yet has a lower social cost per GDP of it's payment systems than The Netherlands (because it's a largely cashless society).

Not when you get paid at $1,000 and then need to pay your bills and buy groceries at $500. I think it's reasonable not to bet your ability to feed and shelter yourself and your family on the Bitcoin market.

The religious-like fanaticism is quite something. As if there would be no hope without cryptocurrency, and there's no possible future that bitcoin isn't the center of.

Because capitalism certainly doesn't concentrate power...

You can create more or less the same debt system with bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.

People born into wealthy families have a much better chance of being wealthy (and thus having greater power in society). If your dad was the best at growing oranges and builds an empire of orange production, and then passes it down to his son, his son only has to be pretty good at growing oranges (or pay a modest wage to someone who is good at it to do it for him) to remain wealthy.
Saying you only way to have power in capitalism is to be competent is objectively false. Look at Paris Hilton.

If the benefits of Bitcoin aren't realized until mass adoption there isn't a large incentive for adoption.

The issue is that there's very little to sell people on. I'm interested because I think the technology has a lot of potential, but as of now I see very little reason to use it in any significant way.

How can you say that? I mean the currency did lose 50% of its value over two weeks only six months ago, but this is bitcoin we're talking about. *Bitcoin*. BITCOIN. The only hope against tyranny.
