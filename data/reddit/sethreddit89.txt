The guy has spirit though.  Pretty entertaining to listen to, even though it's clearly some sort of ponzi he's advertising.

Oh crap, I did too.

That's the Trump platform... but the Senate isn't too happy about him trying to end forever wars!

Although this is a common talking point, it isn't factual;  It's important to look at as many facts as possible, and just skim over the rhetoric from the media when possible.
Trump managed to pass **bipartisan** criminal justice reform, and was praised be even his ["sworn enemies"]( in the fake news and Democrat party.  This was surprising to many people [when they read about is!](  (right click -&gt; open in incognito mode if washington post is paywalling you)
[Gallup says]( the economy is the top priority for voters.  Good news, unemployement rates for virtually all minority or under-represented groups are at all-time lows.  The raw employment numbers are at an all time high currently.  Wages growth is outpacing inflation by more than 2%  (3.5% YOY wage growth vs 1.5% inflation).  Keep in mind that CPI removes energy costs from the inflation figure (which isn't fair to lower income citizens, since a large portion of their income goes toward fuel, electricity, etc).  But good news here as well, as energy costs are decreasing by &gt;5% YOY.
*Trump signed an executive action requiring the government to remove at least two regulations for each new regulation;  This has especially affected areas with new technology such as* **cryptocurrencies, banking, SEC,** *etc.*
On the climate front, [US CO2 emissions are decreasing rapidly, and faster than any other country]( In fact, of all 1st world countries, ours is the only one which continues to decrease our emissions year-over-year.  We do need to do something about so many goods manufactured in China (30%+ of world CO2 emissions, largely driven by US demand for their goods), but good news there as well, as we currently have **hundreds of billions** of dollars of tariffs on Chinese imports.  This is having a side-effect of harming Chinas economy for now, but as far as the environment, this is a good thing since they are the  source of air and water pollution.
Don't forget that North and South Korea are on speaking terms for the first time in 70 years;  The hundreds of miles of minefields between their countries (humanitarian disaster waiting to happen!) have been disarmed.  North Korea has [returned the remains of all our soldiers]( they have been holding since the end of the war.  Unfortunately, they haven't committed to serious denuclearization yet, but Trump has managed to push through serious (and enforceable) sanctions through the united nations which are really putting the pressure on North Korea.  I predict they'll be back to the negotiating table soon!
Regarding court appointments (also a top voter concern in the 2016 election), [more than 1/6 of all circuit court judges]( are now Trump appointees;  It will be 1/4 by 2020. 2/9 (22%) of Supreme court justices are currently Trump appointees.   The former is the more important statistic, as only 150 out of 7,000+ circuit cases are heard by the supreme court each year.

It's very common for people to say "Oh, I can't afford a bitcoin!  They are over $9000 these days!"   But owning a whole bitcoin is not feasible for most people.  After all, there can only ever be 21M made, yet this currency is designed to be used by billions of users!
(an analogy is how individual shares of (stock x) are too expensive for the average person to buy - e.g., berkshire - but that does not prevent people from having a 401K!)

The remaining set is not really relevant, since there might be 2^256 possible hashes, but 2^224 possible solutions;  That's a lot of solutions!  But even at 10 exahash/sec network hashrate, it takes (on average) 10 minutes to find one of those (*seemingly* infinite!) valid solutions.
In fact, any solution with a hash prefixed by the correct number of 0's is valid.
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:48:53
it's because a valid block solution is not known, so there is no way to accurately estimate how long it will take to find the next block;  But the difficulty in finding a valid block is increased based on the total network hashrate.
Since rng is rng, sometimes we see two blocks in 15 seconds, and sometimes we go 20 minutes without a new block.
But, on average, blocks are solved every 10 minutes.
