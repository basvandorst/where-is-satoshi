So you are saying it would be good to only have centralized LN hubs by bank-like institutions? Have fun with your government controlled currency.

They will go down as soon as people stop using bitcoin.

As soon as people stop using bitcoin for their small transactions the fees will stabilize.

You are not supposed to do transactions  &lt;500 EUR in the current bitcoin network. It is a decentralised store of value.

It needs to be avoided to have centralized LN hubs. Centralized hubs could be used to monitor and control transactions (similar like conventional banks).

It is quite a big step to a whole lightning network + a lot of unknowns regarding centralization.

There will be one LN hub from a big American company that pays a little bonus to the users for every transaction. This hub also got a gag order and plenty of funding from the US government to forward all the user data.

With current fees it is very likely that you can just afford to open a single LN channel. This would be with some kind of "bank" for an efficient lightning network.
It bears a significant danger of centralization of payment hubs.

Bitcoin is open source. Every single user can decide to opt out of crazy scaling of blocksize at any time. 
But blocksizes of &lt;10 MB is certainly not a problem with contemporary technology and available bandwidth.

In a hub-and-spokes model the hub knows who he is connected to and can track payments as far as I understand. Happy to be corrected.

There is currently no technical argument against a reasonable increase in blocksize. Internet connectivity and storage costs have significantly improved in the last years.
Unmet demand is destroying bitcoin as we have seen in an huge loss of market share this year.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:44:11
It is a tricky question. Segwit2x and Segwit1x have no replay protection. You need to split your coins on the two chains yourself.
An exchange could do the splitting for you. Or they could keep one of the coins. Or delay access to one of the coins. Or could be faster in giving you access.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:22:02
You seem to know a lot of average bitcoin users then.

Bitcoin is the chain with the most accumulated proof of work. If the consensus is to increase the 21 million limit, it will be increased.

@_date: 2017-11-13 15:26:19


Ok, I guess I understand now why it is bad style to re-use addresses. But in principle the change could be sent to the original address or is this prevented at the protocol level?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:31:56
In what sense would be coins stored at address A different after refilling it?
Wouldn't the original transaction A -&gt; B still be valid since the only input address is A?

It is not only development time but also some serious uncertainty whether a lightning network will actually work in an efficient and decentralised way.

Why? I never claimed that bitcoin is technically broken. However, bitcoin needs to evolve in order to stay competitive.
Segwit was also implemented without technical necessity (taking out the transaction malleability part).

@_date: 2017-11-04 00:37:20
That is correct. But even two party LNs are lacking software solutions for exchanges.
And maybe exchanges don't really like the idea to have a low-cost way to transfer funds to the competition.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:55:04
If bitcoin fails economically there is no point of it to be technically sound. Nobody will be using it anymore.
The technical failure will result from nobody maintaining the codebase. So the first vulnerability in SHA256 that will be found at some point in the future will be your technical failure.

Bitcoin does not need decisions or consensus by developers. In the best case any possible bitcoin implementation should be available and users can decide which one they run.

Probably not a popular opinion here, but gold as a physical element has a different type of uniqueness compared to a blockchain made of bits and bytes.

Because current fees are getting &gt;5 USD. And they will continue rising with more adoption.

It is not an improvement, it is weekend + normal fluctuations in the unstable fee market.

Because it was found 15 seconds after the previous one. No time to add transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:58:35
The decentralised exchange could be free and open source. Or part of existing wallets. 
Should not be too expensive to realise. Worst case it could be financed by advertisements. Or small amounts of fees to the developers.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:28:55
If you transact 1000 USD it is just 1% fee.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:40:30
If you go through all the fees from USD to EUR you will probably realize that using something like transferwise is cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:05:53
LNs are still lacking the right software solutions. This might still take a few years to work and find enough adoption.

Thanks, this is very useful information!
Staying in my original example were all the transactions only have a single input:
What would happen if I re-fill address A after sending the coins to C (using address A as change address)? Could in this case the evil merchant sent coins from the re-filled address A to address B?

The first response dismissed bitcoin, saying it is not scalable.
This is Satoshi's response:
"Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 
Satoshi Nakamoto"

Bitcoin is a p2p network. Nobody cares about what nodes "accept" or "not accept" as long as blocks propagate.
