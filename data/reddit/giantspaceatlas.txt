Very legit, go for it
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:46:43
The difference is that they knew they were going to make an episode on this. It´s just unprofessional
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:14:10

Well, atleast the tone is starting to change
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:12:36
Yea, those rates suck.
But they should read up on these things before they make an episode, can´t blame the atm becasue he didn´t know what a miners fee is
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:17:01
Well, some usefull ones, like Centibit and millibit, but they sound terrible, we should make new ones. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:09:48
