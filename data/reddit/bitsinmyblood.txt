On the number pad activity it only says "Cash card". clicking on "Cash card" results in a different activity that shows my zero balance and an "Add cash" button, a greyed out "Cash Out" button and a "Get cash card" button. Still haven't seen BTC mentioned anywhere.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:28:40
Yes, Once the application validates your 'cash card' number and changes the status to active or etching, then the BTC option opens up. Its very similar to the Movie Pass app. I bought it, then couldn't figure out how to use it, then I activated the card and everything worked.

I don't think you understand what determination is and what quitters sound like. Seriously, what do you want? A pity party?
History is filled with stories of people who found a way, despite much hardship, to make a better life for themselves. Other stories of people not finding a way are just as plentiful. You choose. The first lesson is that if you live in place where you can't eat, have no safety, and are not represented by your government then you leave. Or you revolt. But you don't just accept it. 
Do not go gentle into that good night
Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Please, someone, explain to me why there could ever be an honest, legitimate reason to 1) crop and 2) flip an image and 3) remove the logo then 4) attempt to pass that image off as a new image of your ownership.  The answer is none. There is no honest reason.

@_date: 2018-01-30 05:50:09
Context: There was a post yesterday from a guy begging for bitcoin. He wanted to feed his starving family in Venezuela.  Then today he posted an image as "proof" of the successful transmission of funds and the subsequent purchase of goods including food and water. The only problem is the image wasn't his, it was a stock image that was flipped and cropped to mislead the people who sent him money into thinking they did a good thing. Instead, they just bankrolled a scammer's gambling habits.

If the goal long term, then hodl you must. Increasing your  BTC holdings means buying not selling. Keep accumulating, ignore everything anyone says about anything on Reddit.. Day trading BTC is for gamblers and people addicted to anxiety.

Please, if you want to help people then you should use a charity that you've researched. There are kids out there literally dying to get your money, and they'll never see it if you send it to scammers. :(
Context: There was a post yesterday from a guy begging for bitcoin. He wanted to feed his starving family in Venezuela. Then today he posted an image as "proof" of the successful transmission of funds and the subsequent purchase of goods including food and water. The only problem is the image wasn't his, it was a stock image that was flipped and cropped to mislead the people who sent him money into thinking they did a good thing. Instead, they just bankrolled a scammer's gambling habits.

A low hit? Ya, people do ugly, horrible shit all the time, obviously.
I'm a naturally suspicious person. The obvious outcome of a story like this is charity, and there are plenty of desperate people who are too lazy to work hard like the rest of us. I seriously doubt I'm the inky one who wondered. Plus, photos can be faked pretty easily. Also, people's attention span is amazingly short. I'll bet 90% don't follow up. 
I hope it's legit, and if so then I wish you the best of luck. Why not fund a real solution like a revolution to over throw the socialist scum? Everything else, sadly, is a bandaid.

first of all, it would be irresponsible and not very mature of you to spend that money if you couldn't afford to speculate with it. Assuming you are fine to speculate with it,, just HODL. There's no reason you would want to sell your BTC for at least a few years. We are SOOOOO young, you gotta just calm down y'all.

I mean if there was a systemic issue with the platform you would know it. Your situation can't be resolved on reddit. Work directly with bittrex, or a regulatory oversight that can actually do something. I guess its not bad to make others aware, but ultimately this isn't going to resolve the issue.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:38:46
its a lot of weight in terms of corporations, that will be the establishment's first line of defense against the disruption bitcoin represents. You're talking about us being a guppy in terms of the currency market. That is true, we are very small as a currency market.  Bitcoin will begin to devour the fiat markets. NOM NOM NOM.

Yeah, the way we think about bitcoin is that it is a very secure way to store wealth. It is totally unique and not subject to the failures of fiat.  I have a theory that fiat currency is losing value, BTC isn't gaining value. It's not that people are trusting BTC more than they did last year, it's that fiat markets are losing peoples trust.

@_date: 2017-11-27 23:04:18
Even if your interpretation is correct, good luck enforcing it, 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:03:13
buy bitcoin from coinbase because its the easiest. Just be sure to move your BTC off of the coinbase platform for secure storage. Research this subject until you understand it.

Ideally, there will be no 'need' to 'cash out'. Within the next few years, the number of institutions/businesses/people that will accept BTC at payment is going to explode. So, no need to trade your btc for fiat monopoly money.

Also, this means I'm not selling the farm to buy BTC. I have some, and am only improving my position. Posture is HODL as long as financially possible. Enjoy the experiment, it may make you a 1%er. It may end up being just a thrill ride where at the end you have nothing but your experience to show for it. do not over extend yourself. Ever.

segwit is legit, segwit2x is a coordinated attack. If you're trying to get your coins on the 2x side of the fork, pretty sure you just need to use use your backed up wallet info to 'recover' your wallet on the 2x blockchain, since every address that exists on BTC at the time of the fork will exist on the 2x side of the fork.

Withdrawing digital currency
In order to withdraw a digital currency to another exchange or wallet, you'll need to obtain a destination address from that service. Then use the following steps to complete the withdrawal:
Go to gdax.com/trade
Choose a trading pair with the currency you wish to withdraw from under the "select product" menu.
(If you want to withdraw ETH, select ETH/USD or ETH/BTC).
​Select the Withdraw button at the top left.
Select the "BTC address" tab.
Enter the address for the external service, and the amount you wish to withdraw from your GDAX trading account.

It's a really tough question, no doubt. The argument i was talking about is that we may be seeing a wholesale rejection of fiat. But, that's not a stretch because fiat has always been inflationary. People are accustomed to their fiat losing value every day.

@_date: 2017-11-29 02:59:38
that snapshot you sent, you take it to the "hourly" view you can see the spike you're seeing is a result of the 265 bitcoin which sold on gemini

what pieces and types of data for the wallet do you have?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:39:23
So, I'm not very knowledgeable on how markets work in terms of buys and sells. Why do some of the transactions green up arrows, and others have red down arrows? Is it buy green up and sell red down? But then I think that can't be it, because for every guy there is a sell. Oh shit trading currencies confuses me.

OP, a bitcoin is created by computers it is inherently mathematical in nature. Therefore, unlike a dollar which has 4 'quarters'/ 10 'dimes' / 20 'nickles' / 100 'pennies', one "Bitcoin" is simply '1'. Two Bitcoin is '2'. But each of those bitcoins can be divided up into a million pieces.  When a person is referring to a 'satoshi' they are referring to .000001 bitcoin, or 1/1000000 of a bitcoin if you understand the way decimals and fractions work.
Second, you're asking why a bitcoin is over $7000 is USD value. The truth is no one can tell you, other than to say as demand increases, the value will go up. This is because  Bitcoin, again created by computers and controlled by math, has been created in a way that prevents bitcoin from being created indefinitely. Instead, the program that is Bitcoin will create 21 million bitcoin in total, and never any more. This will ensure that the bitcoin remains scarce. Scarcity will dictate that the value for them will be high as long as people want them. 
Remember, you don't have to buy a full bitcoin. You can buy .0001 if you want, or you can buy .00001 or .000354 or basically any fraction you want. 
Think about this for a moment: How much would the USD be worth if there were only 21 million of them? The total US GDP, or gross domestic product, is a metric used to determine how much wealth or value is created annually. Last year the US created/produced 18.57 trillion USD in value. The US dollar is sort of a messenger, in that it communicates the value of the US economy. So, the more GDP the US creates, and the more "buying power" a dollar has. Either a dollar can buy 100 pounds of potatoes, or it can buy 1000 pounds of potatoes. You're still spending 1 dollar, but if the "buying power" is greater, you get more for your dollar. Its sort of like the exchange rates for Canadian dollars. You spend a 'dollar' but get more for it. So, although the math is much more complicated than I am explaining it, it may help to understand bitcoin's value in a more analogical way. If there were only 21 million US dollars in circulation, what do you think would happen to its 'buying power'? it would increase! Everyone would need dollars to buy stuff, and if there were only 21 million of them, then people would be REALLY want and need dollars. When people want and need things that are scarce, then their value increases.
In our case of Bitcoin, since there will be only 21 million and because Bitcoin has a fixed supply (not like the US treasury who can print money out of thin air, thus causing inflation) and therefore remains scarce and subsequently retains its relative value, or buying power. 
If right now one full bitcoin (1.0BTC) can buy you a nice used car, what will happen to its buying power when more and more people see the inherit value of something that remains scarce and behaves contrary to fiat currency(currency backed by a government not gold or something with industrial value) by actually deflating/appreciating in value instead of depreciating/inflating.  
Gold can be and is mined continually here on Earth, and soon will be mined on other planets, asteroids, etc. So, for all practical purposes there's no known limit to the amount of gold. Bitcoin there is a specific known limit of 21 million.
Gold has many industrial uses like computers. Bitcoin's value is derived from its scarcity and its integrity. In world of computers and the internet, the hardest thing to do is to know something is what it says it is. Bitcoin does this in a beautiful way by demanding consensus between a bunch of computers that basically validate ever transactions before its accepted and legit and recorded.
If Bitcoin is worth $7500 USD right now, and .01% of us even understand it, what do you think the value will be once 1% ($75000) or 10% ($750,000) use it?

Yeah I mean it's the basic fundamental understanding that those things which must remain under your control, must remain under your control. Giving someone else possession of and therefore control of something important or vital to you would be a wrong decision.

Ok, top level we're all part of grand experiment. THE big experiment. So, risk is high but the upside is extreme. hold on tight. Lunar express is on the launch pad, about to make a go for the moon.

GL, but you may want to rethink the time frame in which you cash out. Fiat is monopoly money, so delay cashing out as long as possible.

if you give me a gold bar to hold for you that represents a degree of your wealth which, if lost, would be catastrophic then you probably shouldn't let me hold your gold bar. I realize my phrasing was poor, here. I'm just referring to cloud based "wallets" which are nothing more than letting a website be the steward of your asset.

your IT security question is in no way isolated to bitcoin, so basically anyone who has ever had their 2FA broken would have the same question. I really don't see what this has to do with Bitcoin. Again, the problem is you're using a service. That service is not bitcoin, not does any part of your security breach involve bitcoin. You'd be better off moving your coins off service and HODDLE
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:13:36

@_date: 2017-11-01 05:12:30
Well, its no surprise. Most people don't give a flying **ck about the success or failure of this experiment we're all a part of. Most people don't get it or care to get it.

you mean compared to fiat? infinitely minuscule, right now. But rate of adoption means that its market share of transactions will only increase exponentially. Is bitcoin worth more now than it was a year ago? Or is fiat losing its grip, and its relative value is dropping?

So is the backlog growing? How long until its likely to be included? Days? Weeks? Decades?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:15:16
The fact is no one knows. However, think about this: Everything that has value has that value because of the nature and extend of its utility. In other words, stuff is worth something if its good for something. The fact about bitcoin is we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of its true value in respect to its utility. I believe it's value in relation to fiat currency will continue to increase as long as its utility, or potential utility, is continuing to evolve. This may mean that its price will only continue to increase. NO ONE KNOWS. NO ONE KNOWS THE FUTURE.

Yeah, I think you're making a lot of assumptions that are incorrect. This isn't something I've casually thought about. It's something I've spent years investigating. The first assumption you made which is that remote is becoming more of a thing. This is true only got a selection of companies and is primarily allowed for senior staff. Also, you have no concept of what degree of motivation I have. In your theoretical world, sure simply having motivation is enough and everything is fantastic. In reality, it's more complicated than that.  Your entire response lacks any real information, so you obviously have no experience to offer or you're just trolling. Thanks for nothing.

Yes, but I have a wife and young child which makes it more complicated than if I were single.
It's been an ongoing discussion with my wife, and we are considering a move. The main challenge becomes how to make it all work between cash on hand to afford a move, housing, as well as finding the right company and position. The possibility of moving, getting stuck in a similar support role makes me cringe. What a nightmare it would be! 
Not having any developer experience wouldn't make me a prime candidate for a role I want. Would I have to settle for some helpdesk or desktop support role in hopes that, eventually, I'll hopefully find a more desirable position? I hate to admit that's very likely, which doesn't excite me.
I've been working helpdesk jobs since a completed my first degree, an AAS in network infrastructure. My current position I've been at for over 6 years. During that time I completed a Bachelors degree in CS software development as well as acquiring multiple certifications including Oracle Java se7 programmer.
The unfortunate reality is at my current job no one values or cares about any of that, and there's no room to advance into a more senior role.  I'm the most technically educated resource in our department, yet I'm the low man on the totem pole. The only thing that matters is seniority.
So, you're right: moving is really the only option. With it comes a whole nother set of uncertainties. FML, it's discouraging.

That's exactly how I'd describe Bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:44:53
When Bezos realizes that if he wants to shoot his dildo rocket to da moon then he'll need the BTC bump to get there! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:40:45
Plus, once AMZ starts accepting BTC... we'll all begin to construct our moon base.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:38:46
Damn, bro.  Thanks. I'm curious what you think the next 5 years is going to look like.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:14:49
which has more accumulated PoW?
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:56:50
If you've got some of the smartest scientists in the world putting their pursuit of scientific breakthroughs aside to mine bitcoin, you have to ask yourself, "Why would some of the world's smartest people be putting their real work aside to try to gather bitcoin?"
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:55:42
That seems silly to me. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:45:52
To help ensure the survivability of Bitcoin.

He should just buy a flat, then live on the cheap. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:13:51
People will buy bitcoin because unlike fiat currency who lose value, BTC only gains value.

Yes, what router is on your network perimeter? you will need to add port forwarding. You will make a rule on the inbound connections to port 8333 and have those forwarded to the ip address of the machine running core node. There's a website that you can use to check to see if you are accepting connections properly:

The main security advantage of a core wallet is you controlling your keys as well as validating transactions... I mean if you've got those things hosted off-site the hosting would be a security weakness. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:47:36
Right, then you'd have $30 million
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:50:09
Well, sorta. I mean, theoretically someone could just run their own fork on a private network, with only one or a few other nodes all controlled by them. They could maintain that blockchain as long as they wanted to pay for it. From there, they could continue to develop it internally.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:35:37
I'm running a full core node now
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:19:51
Yeah, but also you need to be located in one of main technology markets. If you're like me and live in a rural area, there's basically zero chance to work in CS, programming, or software development.

We can hope the exposure continues! no whammies no whammies big money! Yeah sleazywood is evil, no question about it. I remember talking to people about weed being legalized, and they said the same 30 year projection, and I always thought it'd happen faster than anyone expected. It took barely ten years from those conversations. Culturally we weren't ready, then all of a sudden, we were. Maybe crypto will be the same, maybe it will similarly gain momentum and give 'going viral' a new meaning.

Early adapter or early adopter?
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:59:47
It is a real concern. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:34:58
I think this angle is not given the attention it deserves. Perception is reality, and if we help push perception of the mBTC, the cost/value is way easier for the layperson to understand and not have a brain glitch over it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:52:52
Plus, with there not be transactions fees? After sending them around, they continue to evaporate.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:39:59
I'm fine with this. Slowing adoption ensures those of us that are capable of understanding this can maximize our profit.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:51:25
Yes, instructions will be discovered if / when that happens

Why use coinbase any more you can buy on cash app? or gemini? or robinhood?

What I don't understand is how I can actively see what the daemon is doing. Yeah the bitnodes.21.co site tells me Its accepting connections, but how do I know if its actually 'working' ?

Well, sounds like you've really given up.

Bitcoin is the most secure storage of value.
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:21:21
Yes, this is what we expect. Carry on with business as usual. Will we hit 10k before the end of the year? Maybe, wouldn't be surprised if we did... meh. Whatever. :)

Forgive my ignorance, but this is an area that confuses me.  I thought the reward for miners was the block reward. So,if the miner does process transactions, but doesn't solve the block, do they get nothing for their troubles?

Yes, it is

There are plenty of houses here in Washington State that you could buy for that. But this is rural, not a city. A city you could make a down payment with that... which is why I think living in cities isn't worth it. The cost in Seattle, for instance, is insane.

Thanks for the kind words, friend. Its easy to get discouraged in the vacuum of small town life, so kind words from a stranger are always appreciated. Overall, I'm generally optimistic, but the some days the dream of professional development seems out of reach . 
I've never heard that quote, but I can see how it could be interpreted in that context.  I agree with you. I'm definitely aware of the situation in regards to the exponential networking and opportunity potential.  For a while I had it in my mind that I could find a remote position, but that's proven to be pretty unrealistic.
I dread the idea of working support, but it's still a fallback position I should embrace. Thanks again for the thoughtful response.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:04:20
From what 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:10:48
Well, isn't it obvious that the demand for bitcoin would go up? I'll tell you this, them beginning to accept bitcoin won't decrease the percentage of their orders being paid in bitcoin...

The docs said to run the daemon as a separate, locked own account. So, that's what I've done. I run the wallet from my personal account, then have a standard user account used as a service account which runs the daemon. Unknown if it's doing anything. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:48:42
So dramatic. LoL

wait, so coinbase is also defecting?
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:31:36
OK. So I run a small core node from home. is there anything special I need to do in order to deny the sw2x hard fork and continue with bitcoin core? Or is it automatic? Sorry for my ignorance.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:19:12
Thanks for your response. I have the port open, already, and tested it. It says its receiving connections. Looks like still on 0.15.0 though
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:19:29
So, I use blockchain.info as my wallet. Is it correct to say that anything I do with the BCH will not affect my BTC balance? Basically, I have two wallets, one on each blockchain, that are exactly the same at the time of the fork, right?
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:05:23
because there's audio
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:13:06
Thank you! That's exactly my point. The demand drives the price... this is simple economics, folks.
