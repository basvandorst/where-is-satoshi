Dead serious. I want to see how you answer the question.

Ledger Nano S reviews on amazon have a startling 18% giving it a one star rating, product arrived with tamper seal missing, not new, et cetera. Someone is flooding market with tampered devices they will steal off of later? 
Edit on ledger name

Now its me being a jerk. I apologize. I just thought it was ironic and bad humored that in a string of posts about being generous to the uninitiated you weren’t - yes its easy math once you get it all clear in your head. But some folks who are three days deep dont have it all clear. Bless them for having the balls to jump in and do it! Also better for all of us in the long run that they do. Have a good night.

Whats the answer then, genius?

all true...... but the greater the market cap, and the more numerous the individuals who are hold/hodling, then the more become the ways that it can be used as a currency (new BTMs et cet) and thus, in time, the greater the number of people who will buy and sell, and in that increase, the coin will be less likely to drop when some need to sell it. I think, actually, that is what is happening now.... nearly all the other altcoins require BTC to purchase them.... so the BTC economy is being born right now.... each day that passes means greater liklihood of survival.

Does a coinbase account automatically give me an electronic wallet? Thats one in the same, right?

it is an interesting thing worth talking about though, while not expecting further exponential growth, or feeling entitled to it. I think people are A) waiting for a BTC drop in order to go back in with more capital; B) the systems are frankly stressed out (money xnsfr, actual mining, websites, et cet) and C) it has for now actually reached something like a use plateau [I think I just invented that term]. What I mean is that demand equals supply, with lots of actual turnover that signifies not growth in cost but growth in usage. Keep in mind that many of the alt coins that are being traded (and in some cases rising hugely) are mostly being purchased in BTC, so BTC is actually enlarging as a useful currency at the moment. Not sure this holds any reality but there is my theory!

Yup, I was right. When given half a chance you’d spring upon the opportunity to be twice the jerk you were in the original post. Kind of like my 100 dollars doubling to 200! I reap the entertainment and you do the work of “mining” that much more bitch attitude for public display. I guess thats called Bitchcoin.
