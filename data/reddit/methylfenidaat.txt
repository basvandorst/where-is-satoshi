Weird that they get promoted by CitiBank, that's one of the Banks who founded the FED 115 years ago.
"In 1910, three years before the US Federal Reserve was founded, Senator Nelson Aldrich, Frank Vanderlip of National City (Citibank), Henry Davison of Morgan Bank, and Paul Warburg of the Kuhn, Loeb Investment House met secretly at Jekyll Island in Georgia to formulate a plan for a US central bank just years ahead of World War I."

never going to happen, if a sidechain does 1 to 1, then also the value stays the same.

So if i understand clearly, when you buy something paying with BTC, you pay tax and when the shop exchanges it to fiat, they pay again tax, right?
 
Then shops could, for now, make use of companies like bitpay, offer product in fiat, allow customers pay via bitpay at checkout, and companies receive fiat from bitpay.
I understand that this will not help exchanges, but for the time being merchants can just bypass this stupid rule, not?

Holland is not the right name, only 2 provinces are called (north and south) Holland. The name of country you are talking about is "the Netherlands" and is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 
In dutch: "Nederland" is een land dat deel uitmaakt van het "Koninkrijk der Nederlanden"
The Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to as "Holland", which in strict usage, refers only to North and South Holland, two of its provinces. Since these two provinces are the most populous and famous of the Netherlands, they often serve as a metonym for the entire country. Referring to the Netherlands as Holland is technically incorrect or informal, depending on the context, but is more acceptable when referring to the national football team.

The Islamic State uses the US Dollar to facilitate a lot of its trade since it’s used worldwide and doesn’t need to be exchanged as the local currencies plummet in value. The Islamic State cannot buy and sell loads of Bitcoin for cash as none of its neighbors have large Bitcoin communities to facilitate it. If the Islamic State manages to penetrate the banking sector in order to facilitate Bitcoin trade and anonymizing of its transactions the blame would lie with the banks that have allowed them to use their service not with Bitcoin or Dark Wallet itself.

Rothschild Conspiracy: A documentary looking at banking tycoons: from the Rothschild family in Europe to JP Morgan and others in the US. How banks not only control governments but also appoint politicians through huge campaign donations. 
Governments at the service of the major banks, the best example: the Obama administration and the history's biggest bail out of the same institutions that caused the Great Recession.
Also looking at the International Banking Cartel led by the Bank for International Settlement (in Basel, Switzerland) known as the bank of central banks (58 central banks) and The US Federal reserve System.

Always Keep Browser Backup
Enable this option to force a wallet backup to be stored in your browsers local storage even when two factor authentication is enabled. If enabled an attacker with access to your browser would be able to circumvent two factor authentication, however if the wallet is accessed using any other PC or browser it is still protected by two factor authentication.

But the Paul Horner I know, he was a great man. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of masturbation that it deserves.

Speech That Got Judge Napolitano Fired From Fox News!
Asking questions as Judge Andrew Napolitano did in a recent broadcast on his now cancelled daily show may very well be the reason behind his recent dismissal from Fox. Though specific details are hard to come by because the Judge has yet to give any interviews on the matter, it's believed that his refusal to bow to commonly manufactured media narratives is among one of several key reasons he is no longer with the network.
The following 5-Minute Speech that Got Napolitano Fired from Fox News is one that should not only be forwarded and shared with every single man, woman and child in this country, but taught and expounded upon in every social studies, civics and government class from first grade through college.

A supernetwork, or supernet, is an Internet Protocol (IP) network that is formed from the combination of two or more networks (or subnets) with a common Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) prefix. The new routing prefix for the combined network aggregates the prefixes of the constituent networks. It must not contain other prefixes of networks that do not lie in the same routing path. The process of forming a supernet is often called supernetting, prefix aggregation, route aggregation, or route summarization.
Supernetting within the Internet serves as a preventive strategy to avoid topological fragmentation of the IP address space by using a hierarchical allocation system that delegates control of segments of address space to regional network service providers.This method facilitates regional route aggregation. The benefits of supernetting are conservation of address space and efficiencies gained in routers in terms of memory storage of route information and processing overhead when matching routes. Supernetting, however, has risks

When you logon to your blockchain.info account your browser downloads the wallet en decrypts it locally, showing its content in your browser. When you make a new address, this address is stored in the local cached wallet. Next, if the connection breaks or gets interrupted, that wallet file is not uploaded to blockchain.info. When you logon next time, you download again the wallet file, not containing the new address.
How to fix? Make a backup of the wallet everytime you add new addresses, forcing the site to sync with your local cached wallet

Even if it doesn't block anything like Mike says, source code should not contain lists of IP addresses and or certificates to be blacklisted. Also to not download lists of IP's to be 'blocked' / 'blacklisted', and at least not being active by default.
There are other solutions to protect against DoS: 
Also this code does not protect against botnets who are not using Tor (witch are far cheaper to run compared to slower Tor network).
Why not make a separate/dedicated app for this? Being hard coded in BitcoinXT it goes against a total open and free network.
One more thing, at the project page under "Currently it contains the following additional changes:"
It also should tell that it contains a Tor filter/DoS projection code, and not kept quiet.

How to stop this? I was thinking to watch what they use on Tx cost and set my nodes to accept those who pay slightly more. Is that an idea? Of course it also will block legit payments who try to send cheap.

My first own computer was a MSX 1, but I already had some experience with a C64 at a computer club (those clubs were really fun back then). My dad tried to slow me down in every way, stopped me from going to high school and such just to go work and make money early. But I always found my way back in to the IT world, and this time I am on top of it, not ignoring my feelings about the future of Bitcoin. I'm in fully.
Name it and I have done it, from running a BBS to working at an Internet service provider, always building my own computers en electronic gadgets (still do with micro computers like the Raspberry etc). Have been in the UK for Robot Wars and was a DJ for many years (lots of nerds seem to like to do this).
Building small networks for 1 person companies up to mainframes for banks, and doing support at VPS hosting companies for a while. 
I'm way over 40 :-)

Because in 2000-2015 people use all the stuff invented before that time. Only nerds, geeks saw the potential of it. Same counts now with the Bitcoin protocol.  "email? whats wrong with writing a letter?" vs "virtual money? no one will ever use that, because banks don't control it."
