what do you mean *only*? where do your loyalties lie if the other countries want to sanction the US, they can. if you want to vote out politicians that start wars (*hint* the last few wars were started by republican presidents) then do that. but don't go soft on countries sabotaging and actively interfering in the US elections unless you have differently aligned interests.

do you know what virtue signaling even means?

the line is drawn by the people who enforce it. do you trust the US or Russia on being generally equitable and fair about these things? do you think Russia's actions in Ukraine were justified in any way? these things would color your opinion and inform me of where you're coming from.

where's the hypocrisy in this if you're aligned with American interests? are you aligned with American interests?


wow, i see it takes a pointed comment to bring out your true argument skills. *name calling* like some annoyed five-year old.

that document was posted because you said russian sabotage of american elections hadn't happened and there was no evidence. we're not talking about collusion.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:37:08
but you downplayed it. you weren't making a good faith argument or comparison

jesus h. christ, the fucking audacity to repeat a tired cliched talking point.


this is not a fucking joke. this is the United States Department of Justice laying out a *criminal* case indicting people based on testimony offered in front of a Grand Jury. not some 2-bit redditors aggrieved pontification.

*literally all it was*
that's why they had 37 pages of indictments. it was literally a picture of Satan arm wrestling Jesus. 
robert swan mueller III, decorated Vietnam vet (let me remind you that your Daddy, Donald Trump had five, count 'em five, deferments on the Vietnam War draft for the flimsiest of reasons!), decided to have over 20,000 words, 37 pages, instead of posting a succinct "literally pictures of Satan arm wrestling with Jesus" comment like the great decided. 


read the 37 pages of indictments. be less glib you freaking reddit commentor who is basically a karma whore.










pinnacle of discourse this fellow is.

why should there be equivalency? i don't understand.


and you're still downplaying it. i'm sorry to see the way you're engaging in this discussion.
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:53:53
sure. bernie bros? you're really shallow in your analysis aren't you? without any rebuttals you pick on the most inane things you can talk about. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:31:33


that's possibly the most charitable interpretation of sabotaging and actively interfering in another country's election that i've heard of thus far. good to see your perspectives and loyalty.

well that explains it then, doesn't it? it's not hypocrisy so much so as differently aligned interests. and yes, it's one thing to not support warmongering Republican presidents, but it's another thing to say that since we had a bunch of presidents in the past that waged wars and did terrible things, we (as americans) should let the russians sabotage our elections. i think that logic is asinine at best.

far too many ...

so it should be swiftly punished you're telling me. that the russian sanctions maybe don't go far enough and trump's non-enforcement of sanctions signed by himself and passed by both republican bodies of congress near-unanimously is tantamount to impeachable dereliction of duty, right?
