i think this is contract law vs property law 
they may have had a contract to trade specific assets, but it doesnt have a bearing on whether those assets can or are legally considered personal property with all the protections that would entail.

okay.. but simply *knowing* my account number cant guarantee you can spend money in my account...   you have to commit crimes through the bank... and they have to be involved 
simply knowing a private key to a BTC wallet immediately grants control over all funds in those accounts... and what legal recourse would ....
wait.. okay i see your argument now... 
your saying your BTC should be protected in any *financial institution* like USD or any other fiat..
... FDIC and the like... 
i suppose i agree... but i also dont believe any BTC you "own" that is held by a third party is not actually yours  and you dont control it.. you might as well "own" a promissory note.

i would argue that most digital asset would fall under that "media"  catagory... ie, digital music, movies.. etc...  other intellectual property.  
and the value in those is their ability and \*demand\* to be \*distributed\*  and that they should be protected to make their distribution illegal that the owner can maintain rights of distribution
in the case of private keys their value is in their ability to  be \*concealed\* ...from others... and once those digital assets  are compromised, the \*entire\* value of the asset it lost... not just damaged..

in about 4 years bitcoins cryptographic methods will be insecure.

as computing power increases, that principle *will* change.
i see your your analogy of the key to the car, but maybe it is more apt to say a key to a safe...
if the key can be determined.. the safe may still be yours, but its value is still lost...

if one of the numbers is lucky, do i win a prize?!?

i understand the argument, but i dont believe numbers can be property...
the value of bitcoin is in its very-hard-to-find numbers...   but if those numbers are able to be determined by someone else... does it then become illegal to know "*your*" number?
i feel the situation is similar to when HD DVD was cracked..
big companies put a lot of effort to find a number to protect their copyrights... but when that number was made public..... does it then become illegal to know a number?... because the encryption key, just a big number, is the  "*property*" of a company (or any other person / entity)?   
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:55:08
i agree with the first statement, but not that parallel.
protecting copyrights are protecting value-generating assets...
protecting private keys are protecting value-preserving assets...

something you cant quite put your finger on?
@_date: 2018-10-26 11:35:17
the way i see it bitcoin are numbers, not objects... can you own a number?
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:46:58
but you dont own the account number at a bank..
its just a reference to you assets you have *claim to*... ie.. fiat currency..
its just a bookkeeping convention...  you  actually, most certainly,  do not own what is \*in\* your bank account...
if that were true banks would keep all the cash on their books on hand.. which they most certainly do not.
@_date: 2018-10-26 11:57:52
absolutely not... in fact im distinguishing from the "real"  and the "abstract"  
 
my car is my property.... it is an object... another can be created exactly like it.. but the car in my driveway is still mine..
my bitcoin is based on a very rare "*number*" that only i know....  if someone else computes that value... what right do i have to claim knowledge over a specific number than any other person?  its usefulness to me is only based on the fact that for now no one else has found the number...
