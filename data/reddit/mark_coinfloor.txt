Both are correct. The price you see on our main page is the price you receive if you're buying from one of our brokers. The price you see on the exchange is the price you receive if you deposit GBP and buy on our exchange.

Hi Coinfloor founder here. We are typically the cheapest way to buy bitcoin in the UK. Feel free to check out our orderbook here:  and please let me know if there is any exchange with better liquidity in GBP/BTC. Also feel free to PM me if you are looking for anything specific or want to discuss further.

Cofounder of Coinfloor here. Our spreads are typically tighter than £1 during weekdays and if you are concerned about fees (and you are patient) you can place a passive limit order close to spot in order to pay the 0.15% maker fee. We unfortunately cannot do anything about the £20 that your bank charges, but this should reduce the cost of buying BTC to much lower than 1%. Let me know if you have any questions and feel free to PM me as well.

No. We are glad that the debate has been happening in public on various sites. What we are opposed to is the apparent private lobbying of exchanges and miners *before* going to the community and/or submitting a BIP.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:28:50
Fully agree with you. Bitcoin is only as strong as it’s weakest link. In the beginning, the development effort was just Satoshi, then Sirius came along, followed by others. For a while, MtGox had 80% of the exchange market share, creating a single point of failure which ultimately failed. At one point, Ghash.IO controlled more than 51% of the mining network. 
With all of these events, we have seen Bitcoin come to a dangerous point, only for the community to learn and ultimately become more decentralised. Hopefully this event will be a similar lesson for us all and we can work on further decentralising Bitcoin and its component parts.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:56:03


This is certainly what appears to be happening. The question is whether this outcome could have been achieved in a less fractious way.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:32:01
Agreed. This debate has highlighted an issue that has been around for a while. I’ve always found it difficult to find a satisfactory response to the question “How are changes made to the bitcoin protocol?”.
Hopefully this debate will provide the motivation for the community to create an even more decentralised and transparent mechanism for governing changes.
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:53:56


I think there are fractious people on both sides. A contentious and unilateral hard-fork is fractious by nature. If there are mods banning supporters of 20mb, then those mods are fractious as well. 


Completely agree! No one person is the decision maker in Bitcoin. This is what we are trying to highlight, Bitcoin's governance is decentralised and transparent and needs to move further in this direction.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:05:52
Thanks for the feedback. This is definitely something we can change.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:07:02
Our bank is Bank Polski (PKO) in Poland, the largest bank there. They understand our business and you are indeed correct, it is a GBP account so you have no exchange loss.

Hi, This is Mark Lamb from Coinfloor. I just wanted to say that James did indeed contribute significantly to the creation and beginning stages of Coinfloor, however he is no longer involved in our company in any way, which is why we removed him from our website.
We have been committed to transparency and trust, demonstrating the [first proof of solvency]( as well as being the only exchange to hold all funds in a multi signature cold storage wallet. Our CTO is Obi Nwosu, who we brought on for his 20+ years in the UK technology sector. 
Coinfloor wishes to see Bitcoin succeed as a currency and a means of payment. We are big believers in the transformative potential that Bitcoin has to effect lasting change in financial systems and the larger economy. We will be doing an AMA in the next few weeks and would love to have all of you ask any questions, which we will be able to answer at that time.

If you think about it - this would also incentivise content creators getting content distributed as quickly as possible, which would be another great outcome!

Hi can you PM me your email address and we will make sure someone follows up with you ASAP. Thanks!

Hi Feel free to try [Coinfloor]( we're the UK's largest bitcoin exchange and the main liquidity source for GBP/BTC trading. We will not make you wait 5 days and you will be able to withdraw directly in GBP, without converting to EUR. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:33:30
Sure happy to walk you through it. I've PM'ed you with my contact details.
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:29:49
You can place orders at £701, £702, etc but not £700.01, £700.02, etc. We were the first exchange to go to a £1 (and €1, $1 tick size) and you can read more about that change [here](
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:55:41
This is actually an oft stated inaccuracy.
Authy uses the phone number as a unique ID for your account to ease set up and for SMS verification (if enabled by the website - we don't) **but** your account is locked to your devices unless you enable "Allow Multiple devices" which, if you are using a smart phone, is defaulted to off.  To be safe, always check your settings and disable this until you need it.
In fact, if you are using multiple devices (eg. a Chrome App and a Android App) to connect to the same account, Authy's approach is better than using Google Authenticator as you can only achieve this functionality using a workaround for Gauth which provides less control.
This was verified and tested by ourselves at Coinfloor as well as confirmed in writing by Authy.
More details here: 
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:31:59
No problem!
One of the great things about bitcoin is that you can be the sole custodian of your own money/investment. Definitely check out the various cold storage and hardware wallet options, they can be a great investment.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:59:28
We are referring to Authy's own proprietary authentication mechanism.  More details can be found here: 
Please note:  Authy also supports TOTP (a la Gauth) and, if you use it to store your TOTP tokens and disable back ups, it is functionally equivalent to Google Authenticator so our comments around multi device support would not apply in this case.
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:46:57
We have a EUR/BTC orderbook and a GBP/BTC orderbook. Our GBP/BTC book is more active, but you can transfer funds to either bank account and trade on either orderbook. Please make sure not to transfer Euros to our GBP account details or GBP to our EUR account details, otherwise your bank (or an intermediary bank) may convert the funds in the transfer process, costing you some money.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:30:24
Hi Founder of Coinfloor here, we're the largest and oldest UK exchange, we focus on the GBP/BTC pair. No need to convert to Euros. Feel free to check us out and make use of our highly liquid, robust platform.
Also feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions or issues.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:49:33
No need, link here:

We have a GBP denominated bank in Europe. You can deposit GBP without any conversion costs or efforts involved.

No problem! Thanks ;) we will do!

You might be looking at our Express Buy option, not our Exchange option. Check out the exchange here:

We should update that text, we switched to banking in Czech Republic a while back. Thanks for pointing that out.


You are correct. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:28:17
Sounds like you're in the UK! I'm the founder of [Coinfloor]( the largest UK bitcoin exchange. We have an "Express Buy" option that would probably be suitable for you if you're looking to buy a few hundred £ worth of bitcoin. We also offer a [highly liquid exchange]( where you can trade with zero trading fees. Of course, it's always a good idea to do research on bitcoin before investing in it and to research trading before actively trading. This sub can be a great place to find out more info, you can also take a look at the bitcoin [whitepaper]( or Coindesk's [bitcoin for beginners]( article to get started.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:49:09
Ahhh ok sure
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:46:08
Wash trades are nearly impossible for an exchange to do with a £1 tick size (which is us).
For an exchange with a very small tick size ($0.01 or something) and zero fees, faking volumes is easier to do, because you can trade against your own orders with nearly zero risk of being matched by someone that isn't you. For Coinfloor, our minimum tick size is £1, so anyone looking to create fake volume (including ourselves) would be either taking massive risk of being matched against, or would be doing something that would be immediately detectable by anyone running an algo on the exchange. We are fairly comfortable that our neither we, nor our customers will be conducting wash trades as a result of this change.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:18:40
This risk is why we were the first exchange to use 100% cold storage. We do not store **any** client bitcoin on a server. We do have a hotwallet which is used for withdrawals, but that is composed of company-owned bitcoin. We also were the first exchange to do provable solvency reports and have the longest standing record in monthly block chain audits. Feel free to check out our [blog]( for a complete historical record of these.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:56:29
Yes absolutely. We're an orderbook style exchange, so everyone who is buying, is buying from a seller on the orderbook.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:34:22
Yes absolutely. We are an exchange, users are buying and sell on a marketplace. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:43:01
I would recommend you take a look at [this page first]( Unfortunately we do not accept American citizens for individual accounts at this time.
@_date: 2016-11-16 17:02:57
Hello Founder of Coinfloor here, we will have much lower fees and prices than what you are currently experiencing. Our exchange ([orderbook here]( is the oldest running UK exchange with the best liquidity, tight spreads and a £1 tick size which is very friendly to manual traders. The [fees]( we charge range from 0.1%-0.4% depending on volume and the liquidity is better (deeper books, tighter spreads) than any other UK exchange or purchasing venue.
We also offer a P2P way of buying bitcoin from an approved Coinfloor broker. You can buy bitcoin with UK bank transfer, quickly and easily at very good prices (typically the best in the UK).
Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or would like to get in touch.

We do indeed have a USD market, not just GBP! We also have a EUR market.
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:57:53
Hi Founder of [Coinfloor]( here. Feel free to try us out. We do require that you upload a copy of your government ID, but at least we don't require fingerprints and blood samples! ;)
Also to give you context, the reason that ID is required is that bank transfers in the UK are reversible and for Coinfloor, as the secure, robust and compliant bitcoin exchange for the UK, we have a policy of following AML/KYC regulations. Ultimately it is a hassle to provide these documents, but if you are buying any type of investment product or using a payment service provider, then you would have to go through the same processes. 
As the central hub of liquidity, we will typically be the cheapest place to buy and hopefully the most convenient as well. Feel free to PM me (or ask here) if you have any questions.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:50:07
Hi Founder of [Coinfloor]( here. We are the UK's largest exchange and regularly handle over 1000 BTC per day. We can easily facilitate a £5k purchase, using either our Express Buy or Exchange services. 
If you do want to daytrade, we are the most liquid exchange for GBP/BTC and have Zero Fees for trading. 
Let me know if you have any questions and feel free to PM me.
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:56:38


If you do not choose to back up your Gauth (actually TOTP) tokens, they will not be uploaded to Authy's servers.  Furthermore, backing up requires a password and all tokens are encrypted client side before being sent to Authy.  If you add a new device, the new device will need and require your password in order to decrypt your TOTP tokens.
@_date: 2016-11-02 12:34:04
Hi I am the founder of [Coinfloor]( the main UK bitcoin exchange. If your friend is looking to purchase bitcoin here in the UK, we offer a safe, reliable and highly liquid marketplace for buying bitcoin - either directly from our exchange or from a bitcoin broker offering UK bank transfer. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Unfortunately I do not really have any answers to your questions on the US side of things.
@_date: 2015-08-12 12:47:35
Hi, I'm sorry to see you are not happy with our service. One difference between Coinfloor and many other exchanges is that we hold 100% of client bitcoins in cold storage. This means that when a you deposit bitcoins, you are depositing directly into our underground, cold storage vaults. When you bought bitcoins, you held a bitcoin balance with us and those bitcoins were already securely held in the cold storage.
We also have a feature called Advance Withdrawals, where we provide a float for all customers to quickly withdraw up to 2 bitcoins per withdrawal period. This float consists of Coinfloor-owned bitcoins stored on a server so we can maintain our policy of never keeping any customer-owned bitcoins on a server at any point in time.
If you place a bitcoin withdrawal request for more than 2 XBT in the evening, you can rest assured it will be processed by us in the morning on the next business day. We are continuously working on making our service more convenient without compromising the security and your feedback is appreciated.
