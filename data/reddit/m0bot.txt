Great story, I am Canadian as well! The strength of our dollar is a bit of a concern for me as a person who is debating buying some bitcoin now.
Does this mean that if Bitcoins were purchased today using CAD, and Bitcoin continued to rise while the Canadian dollar strengthened, the two would balance each other out and I wouldn't really gain anything? More troubling is that if this is true, and bitcoin were to fall in value, or even flatline, as the Canadian dollar strengthens, I would end up losing money.
This is a tricky concept to wrap my head around. I may end up passing on buying bitcoin at this point in time. Although 'rooting' for CAD to stay low wouldn't influence the real world outcome, I would also feel bad hoping that our country's economy remains stagnant so I could make a few bucks.
