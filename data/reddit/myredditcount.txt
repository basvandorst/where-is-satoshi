It’s a fork

Maybe you're emailing the wrong person. He got back to me within 2 hours then had the password figured out within 3 hours.
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:29:59
Well it doesn’t have to add up to you. It happened and I have the wallet balance to prove it.

Was going to sell but I’d rather wait till bitcoin is worth 50k. ��
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:23:28
Idk man I’m no expert. It was there an I never bought it. As long as you were holding bitcoin before the fork and after you got the new coin.

Heck ya. Well good luck and I hope the best
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:41:42
I wish you luck. How much do you have in the wallet if you don’t mind me asking?
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:14:22
I almost cried I was so happy. I told my girlfriend and family that I might get some magic internet money back that I bought back in 2013 and they all said give up and quit wasting time on it. Until I showed them the balance of my wallet.

My dumb ass sold at 9635. Going to use the money for a down payment on a house.

I bought a coin for 221 and lost it. Fuck this guy
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:22:29
Where do I sign up. That would be a few grand now
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:42:21
Can't sign in. Says I never set a password. Should I send in the offiline version?  Or should I just Chuck it up to a loss....?
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:12:16
I had 1 coin when they got stollen. 
@_date: 2019-10-14 15:20:57
Good luck.
