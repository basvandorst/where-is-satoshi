I don't think you are completely wrong in your answer, and allow me to say this is just my opinion and have no facts to back up any of this. But the biggest value cryptos hold is the multitude of choices right now. A friend of mine describes crypto currencies and the exchanges of as "the wild west." Which is an apt description. There is a new coin or token on another platform announced every other day. Everyone with a computer and a friend in programming is trying to get in on the action. But I'm going to compare crypto currencies to cell phones. Back in the early 2000s, you had a new phone company coming out with another phone every month. Companies with no business making phones were making cell phones. But as the years progressed, the shit phones fell off the radar, then carriers stopped even activating them, and the iPhones and the Galaxies and the, well I don't really know any others, but I think you understand my point. The shit-coins will be weeded out. Then BTC, BCC/BCH, ETH, NEO, ETC, or whatever coins that so prove themselves, will be the ones that are left and traded as currency. The rest will become little crypto shares.

Chicken. Dipped, breaded, and fried in peanut oil at 350 degrees until cooked through. With a side of mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans and biscuits. I’m hungry.

Give me a tree and I’ll build you a house. Does that make my tree more valuable than your gold? The value of any object is no more or less than what a person is willing to pay to receive or willing to accept to part with the object.

I'm so glad mine isn't the only brain that has thought like this. Like would I go back to when it was only $0.01, buy $100, and then sell at the peaks to buy back in the dips? What would that added liquidity do to the market? 
Or would I just buy it and hodl to sell at ATH? I would like to think that is what I would do.
