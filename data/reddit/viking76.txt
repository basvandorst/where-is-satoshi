Nice speech. Done any social marketing lately? You know, what used to be called pyramid scams? Because the last time I heard some thing like this, was just before a friend lost a lot of money on T5PC and he was desperate to get me to "buy the dream".
I suggest all that's into Bitcoin do a little reality check about the practical use of wealth. Put simply: If you invest in a bottle of 12 year old malt whisky, it will increase in value over the years. Until perhaps someone decides that malt whisky is so last year and brandy is the new thing. But you can still pop the bottle and enjoy it. And that can no one take away from you. 
Now: How do you enjoy Bitcoins? By looking at a string of 0s and 1s? The reality is that you cant enjoy it. Its all about the money. If it falls in value, you have nothing left.
Personally I have invested in real estate with a practical value. I have a nice farm with good grounds for hunting and fishing. I have probably put a million US dollars into it over the last decade. And I'm lucky if I get that value on a sale. But the point is that it has practical value for me. So it gives me joy in life, tax write off and financial safety. And the best way to piss of some salesman from the bank that wants me to invest in stock scams or other crap, is to ask him how his investment can top my farm. It cant. That's the truth. No matter what economical theories that's applied.
So no hating and good luck with your investments. But remember to invest in life.
And please remember all the pyramid scams from around 2000 and ask yourself why there is suddenly virtual currency popping up everywhere with stories about how people have become rich without doing any work at all. Dont that sound familiar?
