"Doesn't solve anything" bold statement considering the current state bitcoin is in.  I think Bitcoin is the future and will turn around but to say litecoin doesn't accomplish anything is pure delusion

You are right.. Maybe not tax law related.  However, it does seem like there is an orchestrated attack to sell cryptos.. and I'm saying bitcoin alt being pushed ahead of schedule validates the sell-off.. In my opinion.

Brian, all you had to do was make an announcement that "BCH would begin trading on x date at x time."  Not an abrupt launch, followed by an abrupt hault during office hours.  Seems to orchestrated. Curious to see it play out as I'm sure the hault at 8500 was no mistake!

Big money flushing out weak bitcoin hands by pumping alt coins.  Money will return to bitcoin and when it does, it'll be glorious.  Atleast I hope :)

Y'all say 75k per litecoin while the litecoin creator is saying $40 per coin in 2018.  
My thoughts are.  1674 per coin before a crash to $176 in 2018

Regret is not the right word.  Like most, holders have probably made their families aware of their investment.  Some have tried to convince why they've made the investment (the tech behind it, the world wide adoption, a new typoe of store of value).  
Unfortunately, my family has Now reached out to me asking about investment advice with bitcoin (as it hit 10k).  Giving the drastic increase, it's very difficult for me to advise purchasing.  
Regret is not the right word.  However, I feel bad that they didn't invest as I'd LOVE to see my parents closer to retiring.  My response " If bitcoin goes to the moon, I'll take you with me".

If coinbase made the responsible move, a simple announcement, days or week in advance with a trading time and day would have helped the liquidity issue.  Very irresponsible for a company with a billion dollar evaluation to open BCH trading after hours with no notice, and then halt it at 8.5k.  Maybe release BCH funds and then open trading days following.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:21:03
Why is llitecoin on the list?  Coinbase needs to focus on their platforms before they introduce more trading volume via another coin.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:06:17
You would be calling out satoshi on this one.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:24:05
Why launch an investigation 1 hour After you start trading a new coin lol.  If they believed there was insider trading, wouldnt that investigation be launched prior to the release?  The evidence hasn't changed.  Someone is trying to save face

Plot twist. Scaling is an issue but BCH has brought even more attention to the btc issue. People are now willing to support s2x over bch/btc after this fiasco . B2x is a Green Light. Fork on the 28th. This is another shakeout in btc to accumulate before s2x fork to which will give segwit plus a small blocksize upgrade. S2x takes bch place as an alt bitcoin that will attempt to replace btc. This is why coinbase irrational launched bch ahead of schedule, to play into s2x.
Edit: if true, can you image the shakedown. People like Roger giving up his stash of bitcoin to bch, only to have bch go worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:22:14
Maybe, maybe not.

BcH will not drop off the top 10.  There is huge money that have accumulated quiet a bit.  Between Xapo and other huge holders of bitcoin during the fork, they have sold hundreds of thousands of BCH and the price has remained stable (In other words, you'd think BCH would plummet after hundreds of thousands would be offloaded, hasn't happened).  It appears BCH is accumulating. 
If you haven't noticed, it doesn't take much for people to invest it alt coins.  Millions flowing into BS coins, even if BCH is ran by crooks, it won't stop huge money flowing into it to make $ in the future.

Weren't we just at 19.9k?

Price goes to 18k and holds until future markets are out.  Then price drops significantly.

Wouldn't the conclusion of insider trading be made Before the BCH launch.  Therefore throwing off the launch.. and conducting an investigation at that time... Silly to say "may be insider trading 1 hour After launch"

Ripple is a joke.  Why would they invest in something like ripple instead of fund their own blockchain to serve their banking needs.

Coinbase announced their roadmap 5 days ago and it had no sign of BCH launching this week.  It was obvious? Hope you got your long in

I wouldn't be worried about the amount siezed.  I'd be more concerned with them blocking channels for criminals to route through (crypto).  
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:33:46
Imo, there is this idea that bcash will overtake bitcoin.. and since it almost looked like it was going to occur (2nd week of nov.) Where bch ran from 200 to 2400, while btc went from 7800 to 5500 at the exact same time.  
The conspiracy theory is, this will happen again.  There for, when btc drops, people are prematurely jumping to bch thinking they are timing this delusional flippening.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:00:44
Thumbs up dude.. even though I didn't read it all because I see the word "I" too often.  Also, it's only been 8 hours since futures market open, calm down prophet

I think we will get close to a trillion market cap for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:37:39
Imo, their motives will be even more clear in a months time.  I find it unfortunate that they choose to list an alt coins that only 4 months old to which was essentially equivalent to being premined (fork bitcoin, play it up as being useless alt while using s2x as smokescreen, accumulate and call-off s2x.) Disgusting.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:28
My thoughts.  This was an orchestrated attack on all coins before the new years.  This was planned imo. BCH wasn't suppose to be released till 2017.  Big names pushed the release so it was part of the attack.  Big whales had btc with coinbase during the fork in August and wanted to unload it during this drop.  
The fact that bch release was pushed ahead of schedule validates this attack before the new year.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:07:31
Coinbase CEO has ahown his interest towards BCH when it was forked as if he was I interested in that direction, I'll have to find the tweets.  It was at the same time vitalik showed support for BCH and was sending congrats out.  I think there is a strategic reason behind coinbase not opening up BCH to its btc customers.  They mentioned January 2018 I believe.  Between coinbase CEO and the fact they won't adopt segwit, amongst other signs.. I think Brian is pushing an agenda

Imo, people are thinking way too short term with respect to this person unloading.  Let him unload and have the market absorb the coins.  This is great that this individual/group is selling now rather then in the future when the price is 10x.  
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:05:47
If they wanted to kill it.  I'm sure they could.
