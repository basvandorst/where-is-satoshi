You need to provide more info on your initial transaction. You “put in” 2100 CAD but how much BTC did you receive? If you were charged a transaction fee or similar, then you likely didn’t receive a full 2100 CAD worth of BTC.

Everyone, and I mean everyone, who says “I’ll only buy after the massive crash” will NEVER buy. The only exception are those of us already in the game who are fully prepared both mentally and economically.
If it started to free fall right now and settle in at $2k tomorrow, I’d buy with every fiat penny I could scrape together. But there is zero chance any of the nocoiners would enter the market at that point.  They’d claim bitcoin was dead and laugh at everyone holding claiming they were “right all along.”
See, this just happened. $2k was no different than $12k as far as a nocoiner is concerned. I’m fine with that.  They will be left out at $20k, and at $40k, and $60k.

Pretty sure there is a very specific law/regulation preventing a 501(c)3 from having a major beneficiary being the creator or entity that created the 501(c)3 in the first place.
Therefore your 501(c)3 should have as it’s primary beneficiary *my* 501(c)3, which is a charity that is endowed to support the needy who do not have sufficient cryptocurrency.

Perhaps they just want to create an investment vehicle that is “easy” for people to purchase in a familiar way.   I think too many people forget that for a LARGE portion of the general public, understanding bitcoin we you and I might is just not realistic at this time. Dealing with private keys, a wallet, keeping track of a list of random words, all these things might as well be like understanding a foreign language.  I’m not saying this is OK, I’m just saying this is how it is.
*This is good for bitcoin.*
Truly. More users. Just another way to connect many individuals to the concept. Perhaps they’ll start to learn more about the tech and realize they don’t need someone to manage it for them and start to grok the tech. But frankly I don’t see someone like my parents **ever** understanding blockchain tech and cryptocurrency in the way I do, and that’s ok. For the true success of bitcoin, we need a myriad of on-ramps to make it accessible to the masses.

It is mind boggling to think he does not have the capacity to really get it, therefore my assumption is he totally gets it. He must understand what a ridiculous proposition he is putting forward, and does it nonetheless because that’s what he’s paid to do, and he simply does not care otherwise.

The “value” is a relative measure and currently you are using things like the USD as a relative measure so it’s “worth” $11k or whatever.  That’s just the amount someone is willing to exchange for it.
The value will stabilize, so to speak, when it no longer matters how many USD or any other fiat currency you’d trade for it because you would simply be valuing goods and services in BTC. It’s a paradigm shift.

*Inflation* doesn’t double an amount of money, but rather decreases the value (purchasing power).  Compound *interest* actually increases the amount.
Without interest, an account holding $1000 in 1990 would still hold just $1000 in 2019. (Assuming no fees or other transactions.)
The effect of inflation would be that you could buy 1000 Coca Colas for that $1000 in 1990 but only 500 Coca Colas in 2019. (Just a made up example, don’t get on me for inaccurate Coca Cola pricing!)

I think you’re right here. I’m not a trader, but if I was a whale I’d probably do the same. I mean, why not? The order book is there to read, setup an algorithm to detect a certain threshold of stop loss orders, then rekt the fukt out of them.
The dilemma is real. We keep discussing this idea of “regulation” but I’m not sure it’s even possible. Yes, you can regulate the on/off ramps to fiat, but the markets will survive beyond the limits of any geographical country, government, or assigned regulators. I don’t know what the answer is, but maybe there is a certain threshold of user population and market participation that will eventually stabilize the market?

You’re better off selling to me at $15k rather than living with all this stress and uncertainty.
But really you need to do some research and learn a bit about the dangers inherent in stop loss sales. They do certainly have a good and useful purpose but they are not “guaranteed” and can also cause an undesirable effect in a volitale market where a “flash crash” triggers your auto sale but moments later the price climbs right back up.  Whales and market manipulators use these automated sells to there advantage. Small minnows like me look at it as an opportunity to buy on sale.
Take a look at the last couple weeks of BTC charts... and be sure to zoom in on details. Count the number of times your $15k stop loss sale might have been triggered and ask yourself if you really would have wanted that to happen seeing how things progressed over a few days time.
As an example, a week ago there was major volatility around the CBOE futures start. BTC dipped into the mid $13k range.  Likewise, if a similar dip occurs with CME futures starting (just minutes ago), I would/will buy as much as I could at $15k.
When you set an auto-sell for stop loss, you need to be comfortable in knowing that if it successfully triggers then you sold at that value *regardless* of what happens to the market thereafter.  Yes, if you auto-sell at $15k during a legitimate massive crash and BTC stabilizes at a price significantly below $15k, then you’ve protected yourself from additional losses.  If you think that scenario is likely, then an auto-sell might be appropriate protection (but it’s not guaranteed). Likewise if a dip chases your stop loss sale to trigger and BTC stabilizes back above $15k, then you need to be comfortable in giving a buyer a nice deal.

Nope. I meant what I wrote, but forgot my /s.
OP admits to not understanding "%". This indicates a lack of fundamental mathematics and this is not someone who should be investing on his own without further education. If he doesn't understand "%" as he puts it, then he might not have a grasp on decimal places, which is critical in understanding the divisibility of a single bitcoin. My proposed trade would certainly be a lesson, but I didn't say it was financially prudent. Actually I would have hoped that OP read it, realized the falsehood, and challenged me on it, at which point I would have been forthcoming about the ruse.
It's like teaching a child that *three* $1 bills is not worth more than *one* $5 bill. At first he might think that 3 pieces of paper is worth more than 1 piece of paper, *when in reality we all know this is a bunch of horseshit and paper fiat is worthless.* ;)

The 4th flip of a coin is still a 50/50 flip regardless of any past pattern. The coin has no memory.
More precisely:  "Even if I flip a coin to heads 3 times in a row, the 4th flip is still an equal chance of heads or tails, 50/50."
Just because he saw some chart activity that looked like a peak (vs valley) in 4-5 day periods means little about the next "timed" event, in lieu of any external factor that could be controlling what he thinks is a "pattern".  Show me a predictable pattern of peaks/dips on a 7-day cycle over 10 weeks and you might be on to something.

While the US is certainly a global economic and military superpower, Bitcoin doesn’t live solely within the confines of the 50 states.
I’m actually more concerned with the choices China continues to make regarding BTC and BTC mining and ASIC production, and don’t think a bunch of bureaucrats in the USA are going to have much of an effect on anything bitcoin.
In fact, I think the more they try to fight it, the more people will embrace it, WORLDWIDE.

What most people don’t get is that the super rich, the true 1%, don’t really give a rat’s ass if bitcoin is at $2k, $20k, or even $200k. If gets that high it will be in a not-far-off possible reality where it’s become commerce integrated.  The 1% will make money on the businesses and processes that make it successful interacting with the traditional economy.  They’ll buy bitcoin along the way at a price that doesn’t make much difference to them, probably if/when the dollar shows serious devaluation or more likely when we see a long term stabilization of bitcoin or whatever the prominent crypto is to survive.

LOL, no.
Redditor since you were in high school, at least, perhaps longer. I just setup a new account for my crypto interests.
The "classic college math" line was a dig but not meant personally, more rather poking fun at college rather than you. But I apologize if insult was taken. Hey, I started out as a math major in college and ended up switching because I thought the real-life applications for a math major were so limited. Boy was I wrong. I'll attribute the bad decision to "classic college extracurricular activities" on my part. But at that time I was one of only a few people in the entire school that actually used the internet. Admittedly it was just browsing the web on a text browser called Lynx on a monochrome Mac with a screen smaller than my iPad. We've come a long way.
Anyway, I was pointing out the error in your calculation because it's a common type of reasoning fallacy and it might improve your logical thinking to examine it from an unemotional perspective. This is rather helpful as an investing tool. You mentioned you were "still beating myself up" about it, and I don't think you should. Here's why:
I'll use a different scenario that doesn't effect either of us emotionally. The popular first bitcoin purchase for goods/services, which was a pizza that "cost" 10,000 BTC. At the time, 10k BTC was the equivalent of $60. Today at the time of calculation 10,000 BTC = $192,150,000 USD.
Now if that were me, I might also still be "beating myself up" about it. There's a certain intensity that would arise from missing out on ~$200m that I'm not sure I can predict my emotional state. This is a far cry from the $200 you spent that has since tripled in BTC value. It also greatly overshadowed the 500 BTC that I *almost* purchased for $2 each. That $1000 investment would have been $9.6m today. I'll admit I was initially experiencing some despair when I looked back in my email and found a confirmation letter for setting up my trading account in 2011.
But then I realized a couple things. First... it was for a Mt. Gox account. Egads! I think that might have been worse, getting the current value equivalent of $10m taken from me rather than not getting it in the first place. There's a certain type of emotional scar left by thievery and fortunately I've only felt it on smaller things. Biggest amount I've ever had stolen was probably $4k and I was pissed for a while.
However, I think I would have had enough sense to move most of my funds off a trading account into a separate wallet that would have survived the Mt. Gox fiasco. So I still battled with the thought of passing on that chance to turn $1000 into $10m. Ultimately I've come to a very comforting conclusion: There is no way I would have been that patient or fearless to hodl those gains. No way. I would have cashed out partially along the way or more likely the whole lot of it. There were plenty of moments in the last 6 years where I needed money and it would have solved some big problems that would have been worth it at the time.
So how does this relate to you? I think if you process this, you'll realize how silly it is to get emotionally hung up on the $200 you spent. It's current value in bitcoins, dollars, or whatever goods or service you spent it on is irrelevant.
What's important is that you invested in bitcoin back in September and you have a +$900 gain (+$1000 today?) to show for it. You made good choices and that fair outweighs any debatable notion about your spending $200. I remember college at least enough to know that $200 is a big spend. Frankly, whether it was books, tuition, or a couple nights out with friends, it was worth it to you at the time. And if the spend wasn't so much "worth it" in hindsight, think of it as investing $200 in your ability to make sound investment decisions in the future since you see what "might have been." Don't dwell on the loss, but rather accept the benefit.
So that was long winded, but I did want to make a point and do so without resorting to a dig or insult, because no personal attack was intended. Hopefully you read it and might take something positive away from it. Perhaps some other redditor might discover it, apply it to their situation and reap a positive emotional result. If anything, writing about it helps me reinforce my positive thinking about investments, bitcoin, and hodling.

Theory:  The consistent incremental sell walls during the last couple weeks have kept bitcoin from absolutely *exploding* upwards... and I think that’s a **good thing**.
Initially it seemed more malicious, like someone or some group wanted to manipulate the market just to pull off a long period of buys while keeping the price tempered. That may be the original intent.
Or, it could have been done with the explicit intent to stifle growth by someone who doesn’t want it to outshine their alt coin. (While flooding miners with bogus txs to slow down moving BTC causing anxiety via its side effects and pressure for “new” tech.)
Another’s possibility is that it’s simply an aggregation of natural sale orders on round numbers, because we are human and round numbers tend to “feel” attractive, safe, and easy to grasp.
Regardless, I think the overall price suppression is actually doing the entire market a favor by keeping excessive and unhealthy gains in check. I’m not worried because I’d rather see a gentler rise in the next few months with only minor dips (which are more consistent due to the sell wall pressure). It will help create confidence in this technology for the thousands of new market participants who barely understand it at this point.
A 24/7 market is tough to grasp for many traditional investors. They like the security of a Wall Street exchange that starts and ends it’s day and they don’t worry as much beyond the trading day and minimal “extended” hours. They can sleep better. That’s more difficult for some in a 24/7 market if they’re worried a 50% retraction could occur overnight. The market movers may be providing a very nice benefit here.

I don't think you can "scan" directly from an app, and I agree about the camera searching online, better to avoid.  Just type the address in, double check, triple check, and keep checking until you're 100% sure.  Another less obsessive approach would be to send a test transaction of only a small amount, and once that clears do an additional transaction for the amount you really want to send. HOWEVER, due to the current high tx fees and delays in the mempool, that could cost you a week or so of waiting.

You should DEFINITELY NOT...
...listen to a bunch of random posts on an internet message board for an opinion on whether it’s a good time to buy. There isn’t a single person here that can accurately predict the future with 100% success.

When? On what date specifically? And in what locale at what energy cost? Because the difficulty of mining bitcoin increases with time, and the cost of electricity varies greatly depending on where you are geographically and how you are obtaining that energy.
Think about it this way... if the true cost of mining 1 BTC at present was under $2000 and market value of BTC is currently around $17k, then I would expect it would be more worthwhile to invest in mining hardware than actual bitcoins, but it’s not. Not at all.
An article about mining bitcoin from the last has little to do with present mining costs and actual value.

Yes. But they are in the form of multiple distinct wallets in the app. Roger Ver said he "deleted the Bitcoin Core wallet" because he never used it anymore, trying to convey the impression that he didn't even hold BTC. The listener is then left wondering... did he sell it all?
No, of course he didn't. He might be a lot of things, but he's not stupid. Obviously he manages it elsewhere and not in the Bitcoin.com Wallet he was using for the demo.
But he is intentionally saying that to get a response. Maybe just me posting about the comment it is type of response he wants, so I'm buying in to the ploy and feeding the bear.
So right after he insists that people who can't understand the difference in BTC and BCH in his wallet app must be "retarded", he follows up with an off-hand comment about deleting the BTC part of his wallet as if we'd fall for the idea that he doesn't even hold BTC. You'd have to be retarded to believe that... I think is what he might be thinking.

Incorrect. Access requires technology. Further, in global comparisons of wealth variation, a 3rd world bitcoiner might only have a small sum to be able to convert to BTC. Let’s use a figure of $20 USD equivalent which could easily be the scrapings together after a month’s pay for this hypothetical 3rd World Bitcoiner. Based on high transaction fees and trying to convert something like $20 at a time, this current version of the system is not equal access. He would end up with most of his fiat going to transaction fees rather than turning into BTC. 
People need to understand that the transaction fee of bitcoin is essentially the “tax” paid for mobilizing the system. Just because a “tax” is homogenously distributed among active users doesn’t mean it’s “equal” in its impact.
I agree that the code is *for* everyone, but not everyone has realistic access. This will need to be part of the overhaul we see in the coming years.

This will undoubtedly stay buried, but while everyone here is whining about the BTC/BCH battle they are missing the more important aspect of this post: *a Bitcoin ATM in Greece is running out of Bitcoins.* (I’m not sure how anyone could “run out” of Bitcoin to sell... simply buy more and sell higher?) Anyway, I was just updating a friend today on the overall state of cryptocurrency worldwide and mentioned the Morocco “ban”, the uptick of usage in Puerto Rico, reports of BTC thriving in Venezuela, and concluded that I figured we would see Greece in the news within a week.
I spent some time there roughly 20 years ago, and both corruption and a common distaste for central finance was thick. Mass demonstrations against the EU were underway mostly focused on the loss of economic soveriegnty.  Destruction followed, with heavy austerity and endless debt, so I figured that at this point in time any smart Greeks would be hoarding BTC as fast as they possibly could. Not surprised to see this post with a direct example of this.
I believe the fierce and passionate Greek attitude will lead to a *swift* and massive adoption of crypto currency and potentially be the spark that ignites the flame not just across Europe but in many directions. Greece is a nexus between the western and Eastern Europe, greater Asia and Africa and the Mid East. The birthplace of democracy may in fact be a critical player in the still painful birthing of personal financial freedom.

They are different types of systems, really, that work cooperatively.
**Coinbase** is like a *bank* where your account consists of "wallets" are where you can hold USD or BTC/ETH/LTC. They do "sell" you coins for USD, with fees and only at a set price which is less favorable than current market at any given time. They are acting more as a merchant here, and obviously making some profit on the spread and fees. You could "trade" in a way, such as selling BTC for USD, then using the USD to buy ETH, but the fee structure, less favorable pricing and even transaction times make this inefficient and costly. And while they call it a "wallet", they are retaining the private keys on your behalf. For some persons, especially in lower balance situations, I don't think that's a bad thing. But most people would advise you not to keep large sums in an online wallet, and rather transfer to an independent wallet (software, hardware, paper) where you retain your private keys. You'll have the added risk of losing that information forever, but it is arguably more secure.
In comparison, **GDAX** is a *trading exchange*. It's more akin to an investment account at a traditional broker, although you are your own trader and there is no service provided by the exchange other than facilitating the market transactions. Because of the relationship between Coinbase and GDAX, they currently offer free transfers between your accounts. Right now the Bitcoin system is experiencing rather high transaction rates. This is a temporary situation despite what the trolls might say. By participating in the GDAX market, you have control over your buy/sell prices, can set limits, etc., and also can trade with BTC/ETH and BTC/LTC pairs rather than just USD pairing. Coinbase has also announced they will be bringing additional altcoins to the market in early 2018. Until then, if you want access to trade for more coins, you'll need to move funds to an alternate market.
One thing I forgot to mention in my post above is that just as there are limits on your deposits into Coinbase and/or GDAX which will lengthen the time it takes to get a full $100k funded, there are also **limits on withdrawals**.  Coinbase and GDAX share the limit, which I think is initial a limit on withdrawing no more than $10,000 per day. There is a form you can submit within your account to increase those limits, and it appears the next level is $50,000, then $100k, and it goes on up to $25m. (gulp!)  I'd imagine it will take more stringent vetting to increase withdrawal limits, and this is a good thing I believe in terms of overall security both for individuals and the organization as a whole.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:07:18
The sell side (GDAX depth chart) has really smoothed out to even pressure all the way back up to the walls at $20k and a speed bump slightly lower.  When the tide turns it could be a quick ride back up.
In the meantime, plenty of buy pressure supporting the bottom. I’m hoping for a deeper discount, perhaps in the wee hours?

I wonder... how much of his BTC position has Roger sold off? Is it possible he made a terrible mistake and went all in on BCash? Does he hold any BTC at all? Serious question, and it might explain a lot about his behavior.

Coinbase account, will take a few business days to get ID verified and connect bank account, especially due to the high volume and media frenzy going on. You’ll want to simultaneously setup GDAX exchange account (same company). Once you’re authorized and connected for bank funding, you can start depositing and buying BTC. Limits start at a few thousand USD but will increase with full account verification and after your first few transactions. You should end up approved to $10k/week within the first month so overall might take about 3 months total to fund $100k.
You could also run through the same process with Gemini.com (this is the US based exchange started by the Winklevoss twins). And I think you could cut your total funding time in half by making deposits through both exchanges.

My conspiracy friend seems to agree. But even if true I think it’s a failed path and actually going to benefit BTC by shoring up confidence. In fact, I’ll take it one conspiracy theory deeper. Perhaps a psychopathic whale could go so far as create the ultimate anti-BTC alt coin for the reason of boosting BTC in the long run. It’s a stretch, but maybe when you’re filthy rich you need some excitement and cosplaying an evil mastermind might be fun for some. Different strokes.

 Better to transfer from Coinbase wallet into GDAX exchange (same company, no-fee transfer) and then you can do transfers out from there at for free. Exchanges (BTC/USD or BTC/ETH or BTC/LTC) will incur a fee as a taker or free as a maker. See there help section on trading to understand fees.

@_date: 2017-12-19 03:30:34
I’ve been seeing some delayed “echo” like surges in ETH / LTC. It’s as if people jumped into bitcoin, did some research, and decided to diversify crypto holdings. Since Coinbase offers those three (only), I think that prequalified them for further interest.
The tech behind ETH is not perfect, but it’s cleverly different than BTC in its focus on software processing versus just a store of wealth or currency.  Unfortunately many of the ICOs that use ETH have questionable implementations or are just plain cash grab pump and dumps. I believe the market will start to filter these out and punish them accordingly as more new investors learn about the underlying tech. Hopefully ETH survives the shitcoin destruction that is sure to come as the crop is pruned. Maybe the altcoins will just get traded for a ETH and protect the root coin as the dysfunctional leaves drop.
Litecoin peas a great idea, and it is functioning mostly as intended with lower tx fees and faster tx processing. However, I don’t think it’s much more than a proof-of-concept and that the things we learn from litecoin can improve the scaling factors of bitcoin in the long run.
Admittedly, my thoughts on ETH and LTC are largely irrelevant in the shadow of the current market. I would not have expected this much gain on either of them based on BTCs current bull run.  I swapped my meager LTC position for BTC around $120 (LTC value) thinking it was a safe gain. I was really more testing the GDAX trading functions so I would be more comfortable placing orders, but it seemed like a good move at the time. Well, the value of the BTC that I got from that swap is currently about a 40% gain since then. Not bad in common investment gains, but that’s a pittance ;) in the crypto world, amirite? Anyway, had I held the LTC it would be at $357 right now, and that’s a tad better than the 40% I think. Hindsight? Money well spent to get comfortable with swaps on GDAX but I should have left the LTC alone and just added to BTC from USD.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:04
1 week account, lots of years here. In fact I first found out about BTC when it was announced here and followed closely for a while but never got off my ass to get any.

Serious question.  That-other-coin-that-claims-to-be-bitcoin’s-silver just experienced a *dusting attack*.   The purpose of such an attack seems to be to trace wallets and connect them to users for purposes of scamming, social hacking, etc. (as I understand it).   This got me thinking about the recent lightning network tip activity on such a wide scale.  NOTE: I’m *NOT* saying that the lntip bot is a scam. However, I’m *asking* could there be nefarious purposes behind what otherwise appears to be an “altruistic” action?

The “rigging” was based on entering orders without the intent to actually complete them.
I’d argue that the same type of “rigging” is occurring across the board, not just in metals markets, but all securities markets, AND crypto markets. HFT &amp; bots are placing and cancelling orders at a feverish pace. You could say they are just adjusting their orders based on market dynamics but it could just as easily be interpreted as intentional market manipulation.  
  
I remember during the ‘17 bull run how much focus there was on this board regarding “whale sell walls”.  They weren’t just static orders, they would sit and hold the price at a certain level until enough but pressure built up, then they’d get pulled down gobbling up higher sell orders in the blink of an eye, spiking the price.   
  
Yes, this continues to happen on crypto exchanges, I’m just saying there is not so much focus on here about it. (Maybe due to the chat room additions? I don’t pay attention to those). But it was quite a thing to watch during late ‘17 and it makes this year’s bull run pretty ho-hum in comparison.

Consider this:  a wire transfer of USD into Coinbase will take a few days. Will BTC be up, down or sideways at that point?
You will pay a surcharge to purchase directly in Coinbase right now, but you know what price you’re getting right then and there.
Scroll back 3-5 days in the chart and see how you feel about that possibility and then ask yourself if a surcharge is a big deal or not.
Of course if BTC tanks tomorrow, you will be happy you had a delay on available funds.

We’ve come a long way since your post 3y ago when you guessed BTC would be at $265 when it was in the 220s.  Feeling sad that you didn’t buy 100?
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:00:22
Oft repeated answer:  Don’t put in any more than you’re willing to LOSE. Primary reason for this is that Bitcoin is highly volatile.
Personally I wouldn’t consider $200 a life changing amount of money, meaning if I totally lost $200 tomorrow it wouldn’t change my life. I do get that some other people’s life might totally depend on $200 tomorrow. That might be the amount they need to make the rent that they’re already behind on and their kids need a roof over their heads. So it’s all relative.  If $200 is a non-critical amount of money to you, then here are a few possible outcomes of turning it into Bitcoin:
1) Bitcoin drops to near zero and you are out $200.
2) Bitcoin stays the same and you can cash out your $200. (*Bitcoin never stays the same)
3) Bitcoin increases and you buy a Lambo.   (Caution:  You will NOT have Lambo money even if bitcoin goes to $100,000, but you might get a used Ford Fiesta.)
4) ?????

All the anti-gdax sentiment seems to have settled down. I have remained with gdax and haven't had any issues.

Keyword:  *fear*
I find that it's best not to act on emotion. Sounds like you may have learned a valuable lesson. Your buy was a result of "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out) where you imagined you wouldn't have an opportunity to buy at a lower price and that it was going to go 'way up'.
When you sold, it was based on your fear that it would drop even further and you'd lose even more.
Either of those situations *could* have become true, but they did not. However, if the price kept dropping and was at $3000 today, you would have been thankful you sold with only a slight loss. But that isn't what happened, is it?
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:45:54

I think they will, eventually. Banks pretty much perceive an opportunity to transfer money for a customer as an opportunity to generate profit via transfer fees. Customers want to purchase crypto and/or send fiat to exchange accounts. I think it's going to take some regulation to help "protect" them, and they'll make that happen.  As an example, credit cards are able to treat purchases different from cash advances. So you purchase goods and it goes on your balance at a certain interest rate. But when you use the same card account for a cash advance, that portion of your balance can be subject to a different interest rate. And they are able to say that payments toward your balance go towards one or the other first.

@_date: 2018-02-24 17:51:49
Do you mean the $ value market cap or the percentage relative to other coins?
market cap = current market price per coin x existing number of coins
As price goes up, so does market cap, and vice versa. It’s a fairly irrelevant value as far as crypto currency, but it can at least show the relative value of different coins to one another in terms of “market share”.

It's not so much a "banks aren't letting this happen thing" and more a "banks are protecting themselves from chargebacks and fraud thing".  I think it's legitimate concern from credit card issuers based on the high percentage of losses incurred in the Nov/Dec run up when lots of new users flocked to crypto and funded via credit card.

I think it's quite possible, and I think 11k by Monday wouldn't be unrealistic either. But I'd also say 8k by Monday is not out of the question.
I think $10k is a critical point for FOMO building. It sure feels a LOT like Nov-&gt;Dec right now. Starting to see a lot more "just made my first purchase" posts. Hopefully the exchanges (Coinbase I'm talking about you) are better staffed and prepared for more FOMO volume this time around.
