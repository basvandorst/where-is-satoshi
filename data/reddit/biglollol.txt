I know right? Let's just show technological inventions that make bitcoin look small, therefore implying bitcoin has A LOT to grow! MORE FALSE EXPECTATIONS!!! YAY!
Bitcoin is a gimmick of technology anyway. It doesn't even belong between the other technological inventions.

Human psyche is different for every single individual. So yeah, RnG.

People aren't investing in it as a tempt to understand this stuff.
They invest because they want to make some quick bucks.

No you aren't. You're here to profit from bitcoin and have come to desperate actions in order to do so.


?? 


Heh, nope.
Nice link from a "skeptic". You really sound un-biased.


The vix shows it where it *wants* it to go.

Yeah, I'm willing to bet all my nonexistent cryptocurrencies on the fact that it has absolutely nothing to do with laundering. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:01:29


You still invested real money. No need to sweet-talk it.


Yes you are.


There's nothing to learn from RnG gambling. Unless you can manipilate half billion people, you have no hand in the market. Therefore there is nothing to learn as you are dependent on big players and influencers.

No clue, why are you getting this triggered for no reason though?


Oh, you're making up excuses as to why my opinion had more upvotes than yours did? No one brigaded you paranoid idiot.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:57:02


Heh, yeah. That's totally all I do throughout the day. For sure, you seem to know me all too well.
Just kidding. Like I said this was my first post on this whole sub along with my first time browsing this sub. Don't get emotional about losing your investment.


Way being a hypocrit because this clearly only applies to you and not to me.


What? You're the one that obviously got triggered over something. Control your emotions you mongol.




You think you're clever but your context makes no sense since you are the one that insigated this nonsense. Seems like you're not a fan of free speech. Yet you talk about freedom of choice.
Nice one, "friend".
PS: the reason I said "learn to use Reddit" was meant in the way of learn your way around before you assume stuff. It's not hard to click an account and check the comment history, what subs someone browses etc. Yet you decided to make a derogatory statement because you're obviously emotional over something.

Learn how to use Reddit because you're making no sense. The fact I post a comment in this subreddit doesn't have to mean I'm associated with bitcoin in any way. Just so you know.. That was my first comment on this sub because I was just stopping by.
Can you elaborate your thought out, intelligent, snarky comment? Because I don't own any bitcoins nor will I ever invest in it. So yea "here I am".

It's a joke and the people that make those graphs only want to artificially inflate bitcoins so they can profit. Good for them that it's not working at all.
It's also hilarious how everybody on this sub is so "calm" and "relaxed" about all of it because they are almost 100% sure the price will go up and above the prev peak of ~20k.
Everybody is waiting for the price to rise, earn a quick buck and be like "ha, I told you!" To their friends. It's the wet dream of a bitcoin owner to yell at their relatives that they were right.
At least thats the vibe I'm getting.
