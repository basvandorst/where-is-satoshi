Philippines, Sri Lanka, the countries where these migrant workers work, Singapore, Hong Kong, the middle east. This market is why I invested in Bitcoin in the first place. I worked umm.. for cash... in the US for a while to pay debts at home. Western Union is takes a massive cut.. but i couldn't use a regular bank account and options were limited 
There are entire buildings in HK/ SG dedicated wire transfer shops - one for the Indian's one for the Thais etc. and millions of migrant workers as live in help/childcare and in construction

I lived in China for sometime and as soon as I came across bitcoin I bought for all reasons so eloquently stated.

Is that what you think or this a recognised figure from somewhere or based on a comment somewhere else - just curious

I actually just tried bittylicious for GBP - you need a uk bank account -very straightforward for buyers. (sellers need to follow a 'recipe' to get set up but the support team were amazing at following up my queries on this.). Pretty impressed.
I use bitstamp as well and they have pretty quick turnaround.

I totally agree. The tech usa based demographic seems fairly saturated. Something more mainstream or targeted at a different 'growth potential' demographic would have more impact.   I have no idea what esports is so welcome corrections  if I'm making assumptions.
