ELI5 How many Bitcoins are involved in these transactions, if all of the bonds sell? Is this one Satoshi being assigned with a record of ownership per buyer, or is there a large number of Bitcoins involved?

Good point, Samsung Group consists of much more than Samsung Electronics.
Also, does anyone know if Young Sohn has actually **been** on Necker Island, attending the summit?

OK, so if everything is going after plan, why the mistrust?

Can someone ELI5 for a non-US citizen why being in this business is a problem, although it is legalized?

Same here. Also, visually it seems really, really bad.

So you are saying there is no need to test the private key, it just works?

[Here]( are more early posts from a question I asked about a year ago ("What was the very first post on reddit mentioning Bitcoin?")

For me, it is at least twice a day. What would I do: I would force myself to stick to a defined sellout plan. The plan requires me to sell 50% of all my Bitcoins from prices 2,000 to 10,000 USD with every 1,000 USD increase, with the amount sold increasing every time. The rest of the 50% I would of course HODL :)

Interesting. [I asked this]( a while ago and got posts from 2010. Thanks for digging this up.
