you'll never guess what tesla does with the bitcoin after receiving it... (in order to purchase industrial supplies to make more cars)
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:28:39
send it to my paypal and ill give you $500m of btc to your address
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:21:04
what would be a really good idea is to set up an exchange, take everyones crypto, and disappear with it, because its the wild west.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:10:26
maybe in 2040. this is 2017, and we have italian exotic cars to purchase. dont be naive, 99% of buyers dont care about the technology and just want to see that weekly +200% ROI
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:10:08
and what if "the bankers" bought more bitcoin than you already? because i know plenty of young people in IB and finance who are also on this subreddit and definitely throw some of their 300k a year salary into the crypto gamble
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:11
probably because google makes more money selling ads, and amazon makes more money by selling products en masse, than they ever would mining btc.
only questions this stupid could be found on @_date: 2017-12-08 14:00:10
no you should just give him the money yourself, thats what a true christmas present is like
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:25:15
make an app like coinbase that trades VTC, but wait to release it until after i buy hundreds of VTC.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:26
if 10x makes you a billionaire, you're currently a 100 millionaire+ right now, and can live off more than 1 mil a year of passive income. bitcoin gains mean 0 difference to you
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:21:42
little do you know, they actually bought it at $500 and held since then.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:31:36
for most people, bitcoin value will rise faster than their day jobs pay them.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:55:20
crypto doesnt save people from being dumbasses with money. if anything itll force people into more dumb decisions since its so volatile
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:36:45
if you itemize, you might have a case for it, sure. but how do you have loss trading btc when its up 2x every month? you really dont need to day trade.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:21:54
i say 15k and im probably closer than their guesses
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:00:19
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:56
easily, with coinbase account
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:52:55
better than lottery
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:33:34
you think this power consumption is bad, wait til all the btc holders buy teslas
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:32:09
you'd probably pay income tax on the $1000 gain. which is not the 15% cap gain tax (only if you held for a year+). its your income tax bracket 
but you know, you wouldnt have to deal with IRS if you just hold forever.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:06:38
good luck on becoming danish.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:09:30
bruh, investment bankers can afford a lot more btc than anyone here, and im sure they bought some because why not
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:33:04
because its only 2017 and definitely would rather use USD right now. maybe in 2025 try this post again and see what the % is
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:20:43
20 btc is only $340k, all of which will be subject to taxes. not enough to live off of, but definitely enough to retire quite early. hold and or sell and get into safer investments
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:55:40
beg for it on this subreddit. jk, how about adding value to the world in return for payment, or providing a service? ever thought of that?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:57:54
nah it means we can use it as a currency now in exchange for goods. this is supposed to be the endgame of bitcoin anyway.
wait, so we're actually just here to speculate on the price the whole time??
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:50:54
after taxes you can buy a lambo huracan and not have money for gas or insurance...$300k is nothing in todays world
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:54:32
must be hard to match the speed on your speedometer to whatever is written on the sign.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:26:27
you beg on this subreddit for it, apparently. go buy your own
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:27:53
and what will you do at the end of the month...? hopefully you didnt quit your job
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:18:46
this is why i laugh when people say crypto will lift them out of poverty. same problem that lottery winners face. poor people still dont know how to handle their money.
well, you can ask for it back. if that doesnt work, what else can you do except work for more money? and/or keep gambling on crypto
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:06:44
not sure why i would pay in btc when 30 minutes later i've just overpaid for service by 10%
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:27:00
yes. there are fees. then you might need to pay taxes depending on your country. i could sell my btc on coinbase for $5k profit from when i bought them last month
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:30:05
if you converted your runescape gold to USD, yes thats taxable.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:32:28
jesus christ this is sad.
200 cad buy / 21886 cad current price = X cad sell / 100,000 cad potential price
x = 913 cad
you're still poor as shit. use the profit to take a math class
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:26:34
because audi USA doesnt accept bitcoins as payment yet, duh.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:56:13
selling it for USD to purchase lambourghinis.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:30:34
except the IRS classifies them as property, so fuck whatever you think? 
send me your bitcoins before you get locked up thanks, because i dont think they let you use them in prison
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:24:44
only if you dont report your profits if you sell
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:35:57
everyones bitcoin would be worthless if everyone tried selling at once. she just wants to buy them cheap
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:24:41
you probably didnt go to wharton/similar schools and thus dont have the income to back up your statement.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:07:47
when you have so little to lose, why not gamble with it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:59:19
free if you use it at your own bank's ATM...
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:28:50
shit he pulled out of his ass, like anyone who speculates on future value
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:40:59
a luxurious week in japan probably costs less than $1k usd lmao, excluding the price to get there.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:26:18
whatever you feel like losing. obviously a billionaire can put in half a mil with no regrets, but you might be only able to afford a few hundred or few thousand, who knows.
its % based raise anyway. BTC has risen 10x since march or so. people who put in $1 now have $100, people who put in $1000 now have $10k, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:50:30
depends on volume doesnt it? i imagine if you had 50% of volume, you could dump all your coins and pull it either way you want. 10%, not so much. maybe something between those two
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:22:30
arent you just trying to make money so you can become a shareholder and live off dividends...? lol.
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:07:10
so what happens when im a bitcoin banker and someone needs to open a mortgage to buy a home? i can just enslave them in bitcoin instead of usd, yay?
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:24:43
im sure doordash will just adapt blockchain into their existing services if they see a business need
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:14:42
on that note, every video game/computer part you purchased between 2009 and now was a huge waste of money compared to buying cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:20:28
you can still ACH transfer so who really cares
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:58:17
good luck trying to boost the market back up like in november when this video was made lmao
