Have you heard about our Lord and Savior Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:13:41
Why do white people always think we live in fear of NK? You guys care more about it than us lmao.
Like givvy12 said.. we barely speak about it and its barely on the news here.
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:06:26
So basically you're saying that twitter post was right?
Lol @ OP.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:25:59
They did get raided though... that happened and the funny thing is it actually occured couple days prior. US news just picked it up.
Oh this is delicious. Market is so manipulated.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:26:02
Wow so it's only $5!?!?! So Cheap!! Segwit boys!

Didn't realize Korea was a Communist Country.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:54:05
now they are.
nobody was.. i rarely read about it here on reddit.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:03:38
As a Korean, please kill yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:09:26
something something "decentralize"
something something "lighting network"
am i rite?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:24:21
also this actually happened couple days ago in Korea.
us news just picked up on it... kinda strange.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:24:54
it's not banned.
kill yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:09:34
Everyone claiming they are in it for the tech and other pointless reasons, but the market says you're all full of it.
It's like when everyone claims they have the biggest dick on the internet... its somewhat amusing.
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:28:15
takes days to get money because of mempool clogged.
cost $20 to send $1 worth of btc.
not even anonymous.
even the shit coins in cryptopia are better than this coin.
It served it purpose and opened up a world of possibility but just please die already.. we need a new king.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:01:14
ethereum does more transactions then all cryptocurrency combined and that's including bitcoin and you pay a fraction of what the fees are on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:20:17
No, it needs to reach near a million for it to be use as a stable currency. 
Look at BTC even at 18-19k... its flucatates madly.. it will never be used as a store of value/currency til it stabalizes.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:24:28
Damn so its like $29.99 for the membership and another $20-25 dollars for the transfer fee..
Sweet deal! Revolutionary.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:21:15
Suprised nobody is talking about this.
This is one of the main reason btc is looking bearish atm.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:33:09
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:15:13
I mean when u getting charged $30+ dollars and taking 4 days to confirm a fucking xfer(this is actually happening too me).
This coin is literally shit.
Tell me why i should be using this and how tthis coin is going to change the world.
Cause plently of alts coin do what bitcoin does but 100x better.
It's time for btc to step aside because its the myspace of cryptocurrency and will hopefully soon be replaced.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:56:56
I don't think you understand what a Ponzi scheme is yourself and for the record im heavily invested into crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:48:34
My friend used to tell me cryptocurrency was a scam 6 months ago now hes ready to put his life saving into it and he doesn't even know what bitcoin does.
Yup im pretty worried.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:45:02
shill working overdrive i see.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:11:44
Seems like everyone and there mom is praising BTC....
thats not a good sign btw.
@_date: 2018-09-23 06:26:58
they're in it for the pump and dump
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:46:37
u got 1 thing wrong though
majority of people who bought bitcoin aren't here "for freedom" we're here for money.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:24:17
Fuck u and fuck coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:37:17
Listen to OP, if you want to lose money.
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:38:08
don't know what type of chart your looking at, but on my chart looks like we are about to drop right here.
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:50:11
Implying you give a shit if the next man lost his money. Get off your high horse. The truth is youre a nobody. Nobody knows you. You're not rich, you're are not powerful, you're just an average nobody. She's famous and an in a elite class of her own. She will get treated as such irl. That's just the honest truth. Take it how you want.
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:08:49
I guess you don't actively particapate in discord/telegram communities high majority of the people in there don't know what bitcoin does or the underlying tech of any other altcoin. It's just i heard this i heard that... Gonna make me rich! Yay!!!
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:06:27
People who have bitcoin is less than 1%
People who mine bitcoin? Probably far less.
No uprising will occur dumbnuts.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:44:59
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:55:33
If that makes you feel better about yourself. Okay.
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:30:21
That hit you right in the feels eh? Seems to have got under your skin. Sucks being a nobody.

@_date: 2017-05-25 18:21:55
Hmm, i think its just cause i missed it(multi-tasking)on the graph.
It does show low price at 2263.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:30:22
You're right.
I'll take my L.
