I tried the audit function, that didn't work either.

I read it multiple times every day. I think there is a difference between people in the community doing things and new people coming into Bitcoin. You are referring to the former (which I agree with that there is growth) and I am referring to the latter. My perception is that there is a lot of people on the sidelines, people who are undecided. Those are the people who I am talking about.

So at first I thought this meant increased competition for Coinbase, then I read that they will be using Coinbase as a processor. So does this mean that Coinbase just effectively gained  all of Digital River's clients who are interested in accepting Bitcoin?

This is a good link to have in your back pocket every time someone asks "what can you do with bitcoins". I know I sometimes draw a blank because there are so many places now.

Keep up the good work!
Question for you: how aware of bitcoin are people in Nigeria and how far away are we from the level of public awsreness we currently see in the west?

Very interesting read. Also, it looks like Panetta folks have been spending a bit of time in r/bitcoinmarkets.
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:35:50
Great point. I think part of the reason people react so negatively to BTC is because they are put off by the "fiat kills babies talk".
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:04:19
That's crazy. When did you carry out the transaction?
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:06:10
Dead. How do you people come up with this stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:10:30
Stay assy, buttcoin.

Wow. CNBC has developed a major hardon for BTC. Welcome to the club... or should I say, welcome to the chub.

Cleanliness is next to Goxliness.
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:26:15
Yep. As much as I'm not a fan of the guy it has whiffs of cyber-bullying and once others at Wikipedia catch on it's going to get taken down.

Great presentation, was easy to understand! I have three questions: 
1) In the IPO example, what dictates how much BTC the CEO would use to issue shares? I would think there is an incentive on the CEO's side to use as little BTC they can get away with.
2) How is share dilution controlled? Eg: Round 1 of IPO goes well, then I do a round 2 and issue more shares, thus reducing the value of those bought in round 1. 
3) What mechanisms can be used to protect shareholder's rights with the type of IPO you described?
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:09:14
Wow, this article was full of a lot of inaccuracies.
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:02:05
Amazing work. Thank you for this.
What happens in the situation where a) you are not an american  citizen, b) you purchase your coins in a foreign country and c) you move to the USA and keep experiencing gains on those coins? Are you taxable in the US if you spend those coins?
I guess this touches on a deeper question about how the IRS deals with income earned overseas by non-US citizens living in the USA (for school/work/etc).

Throw dem sidechains on it.
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:32:39
Good interview!
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:48:26
It's unfortunate that you are getting downvoted. This is a fair point.
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:47:36
Fingers crossed the theory holds! I want it to be true.

Matt Miller is doing so much good work for Bitcoin. Thank you Matt!

I've had this problem at Cryptsy too so it's not just you. I have contacted them multiple times but nothing changes.

It's because you are not paying attention. For example, this week Kenya's transport system just went cashless (separate system from MPesa). I was just in California last week and they are still feeding dollar bills into those annoying feeders on buses. Granted, the Kenyan system will have its adoption issues (much like healthcare.gov did), but this goes to show you that it's not all as you imagine in Africa. It's just that you don't here about it. There has been a paradigm shift in how Africa is viewed is terms of future development prospects.

Well that escalated quickly.

Thank you!

Wow. Your ignorance is astounding.
@_date: 2013-12-28 11:41:06
Fun to watch growth. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 12:01:02
Sounds amazing. Cannot wait to see in action.
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:49:50
Doesn't matter if he's joking. That headline hurts the pace of adoption. Now a whole bunch of people who follow Krugman and happened to have TL;DR'd his article think Bitcoin = Evil.
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:44:20
This happened to me too. I've been waiting a week for it to fix itself but it hasn't. Has anyone dealt with this before? I'm thinking I'll just log a ticket.
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:30:48
So happy to see this thread. I have been looking at the date anxiously wondering if you guys were gonna stay true to your timeline. 
Would have loved to volunteer but I'm not in US.
Can you please provide an update of the dates when people can start buying from your retail outlets?

I get you OP. The disruptive potential for digital currencies in the developing world is nuts. The financial services infrastructure in a lot of these places is really behind and people just have to put up with it. 
Smartphone adoption (+proliferation of 3g/4g) is on the rise because China is pumping out cheap ones. If Bitcoin can capture a significant chunk of the emerging middle class in the developing world then that would be huge. 
There is a high chance of this happening because 1) remittances (bitcoin's side trick) are are a key source of revenue in the developing world and 2) the states would have a tougher time suppressing bitcoin because the majority of people are not in an electronic system where they can be turned off. No centralized exchanges. People will buy bitcoin on the street, much like mobile cash is bought today. Good luck trying to regulate the sale of bitcoin in [this business.](
My view is that many developing countries (China is special) won't crack down once they realize the commercial opportunities available if their entire population is in an efficient electronic payment network. Dare I say it, governments of developing nations may even have a better chance of collecting sales tax in such a setting.
