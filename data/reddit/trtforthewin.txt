If someone is clueless and his wondering near a precipice at night, I think it's your duty as another human being to at least warned them. Living your life begging for state help when you are old is not what I considered a well lived life. 
I'm in my early 30 and im already retired, I have more money than I'll ever need and im not saying that to brag. I read the books on finance, took personal responsibility and realized that working a 40 hour/week job and hoping I had enough saved aside when im 65 was the worst thing I could do.
Going the normal path and saving money to buy a new car and renovate a kitchen is the dumbest thing someone can do.
Unless she is renovating a fixer upper and plan on selling at profit within the next year, this is what's wrong.

Yes but in here case sue is litterally going broke because she is killing the golden goose to do a kitchen. You should buy her book on investing and tel her you’ll explain how to cash out once she understand investing AKA never sell your best performing asset.

She has an investment that went up 10X in last few years. She has made ZERO research on the said investment, how it works and why it went up in value. She actually does not even understand how to cash it, this is the state of comprehension she has on the said asset. The only thing she wants to know is how to cash out the asset and buy herself a luxury item.

Exactly, if she was re-investing in real estate or hd to pay for unexpected surgery, sure. But she is re-doing her kitchen. Sincerly not surprising, 30% of US population have less than a 5000$ in saving when comes retirment...

Its simply that they don’t understand this new asset. Any millionaire who understand how Bitcoin work is not simply sitting on the sideline, they already have invested. Millionaire cannot see every single good investing opportunity.

It make sense to liquidate an asset if you are already millionaire. Else it’s just plain stupid and you are killing the golden goose. If you are born poor it’s not your fault, but if you die poor it’s entirely your fault.

The problem is that Crypto is a high IQ game right now. With current state of affair, if you are not smart enough you will just get taken advantage of particularly now because of all the scam and ways to lose your BTC. 
\-Wallet that are not trustable, you need to do due diligence before putting BTC in there. 
\-ICO that promised to be the next APPLE but is in fact a complete scam.
\-Fishing website and email that relentlessly try to get to your private keys.
\-Exchange that risk to exit scam with your money
\-Have you thought of a 3 of 5 keys scheme where no one can get to your and steel your BTC with a wrench?
BTC is complicated but that is why it is still such a great opportunity today. It is still far out of reach for most of the lowest 50% IQ of humanity.

Google will use every last bit of your information to either re-sell to 3rd party. 
Google assistant listen to everyword that is spoken, gmail read every single email you receive, google map track your location and know where you are and who you with.
Apple is the only phone provider who makes a genuine effort to _not_ use you sell your information. For example the log of the map service on the iphone is splitted so it cannot be reconstructed then deleted after each trip. Iphone does not read your email and create an avatar on where you go, your interest, etc...

You want proof that google is selling your information to advertisers? That’s their entire business model.
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:02:34
One day, you will do a captcha test, and google will find out you have onset of parkinson, and instead of telling you, they will sell that info to your insurance company and they will raise your rate. You won’t even know why they raise your rate or even that you have onset of parkinson. 
Unless you can pay to own all of your data, things like this will happen over and over again.

Proof that google hands out all your information to 3rd party?

Unless you like being spied on, i would switch from android to apple as soon as possible
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:12:48
Wait when they realize that you can trade anonymously on most exchanges... Then use LocalBitcoins  to cash out. Game Over

When it comes to technology, people overestimate in the short run and underestimate in the long run. No one predicted for 2025 but it will probably be higher than your wildest dream!

Thats a really bad name, the word cash has been tainted by Roger Ver so much that I have a little throw-up reflex when i hear it.

Social engineering, but its quite clever

It’s very easy, its value comes from that it cannot be confiscated by government, it is pseudonymous and soon with lightning network it will become anonymous and untracable. You can transact with anyone in the world without any government spying on you, 
But no one in the mainstream media or who is a lobbyist can say those reasons. So they just say some silly things instead, while we all know why we bought in ��

But can it handle Gigameg?
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:46:33
Thats the easy part, the real test is to not sell when it goes down. This is how you become a real OG bitcoiner.
