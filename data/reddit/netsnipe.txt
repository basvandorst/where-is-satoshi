I posted the following on their Facebook page a week ago and never heard back from them:

"Before I invest, I'd like to know just who is on your development team. Your marketing material highlights your product is "as seen on" ABC 7 &amp; FOX 29, but both sites are just republishing the same self-written press release:
* 
* 
Both of which provide a Kickstarter link that's no longer available ( but your site offers no explanation as to why you've switched to Indiegogo.
You claim that you've designed your own HOOFOO X chip which is supposed superior to the well understood STM32 micro-controller that other trusted wallets use and yet here's the thing that doesn't sit right with me. How did you research, design and fabricate at a commercial scale something more secure than the STM32 based a crowdsourcing target of $20,000 USD unless you already have prior experience and resources to call upon? How can you afford developers in Palto Alto with that level of crowdfunding if you have working prototypes already? Is any of your code open-source so that it can be audited?
Unless some reputable/established names in the crypto community are willing to stand behind this project, I have no reason to believe that this is a genuine and secure wallet."
