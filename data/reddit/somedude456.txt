I threw down 5K this afternoon when it was at like 13,400, and now it's 14,300.  I made an easy $200+
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:51
Tesla? You mean Pagan and Koenigsegg? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:34
I'm with ya, I threw down 5k today.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:15:52
Me, I was like 8k: Fuck, I'll toss in $100
10K: Fuck, ok here's a grand.
13K: Why not, here's 5K.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:48:31
I did $1000 like 2 days ago at a small dip to 17200 or so.  That wasn't smart.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:34:07
I set up coinbase in like 2013 and was about to put in at $750ish.  I was only going to buy 1, but just for fun.  I was waiting for a slight decrease so I felt like I was making a good choice.  It didn't dip any for like 2 days and thus I never bought any.  What slightly sucks is I'm a risky guy, so I know had I bought one, I would have let it ride this whole time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:58:19
I said I was going to toss in another grand if it went below 16,000.  I didn't.  I should have.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:42:50
I'm new to this, but from what everyone is saying, he's like the godfather of bitcoin.  If you got in 1 or 2 years ago, maybe even further back, it was because you saw his youtube videos explaining bitcoin, talking about it, etc.  From what I saw someone say, he sold some/most his bitcoins a while back to pay his bills.  He was using them to keep afloat while traveling and giving speeches on bitcoin.  Now, if anyone listened to what he said 2 years ago and bought 100, they are rich, and he's still not, so right now is a "give back to the guy who educated you on the subject" type thing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:57:07


I'm sorry, but anyone who wins the lotto and has their life ruined...already had a shitty life.  If you can't be financially responsible and know how to say no to others...you're fucked....rich or poor.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:09:39
I bought in with several K at 13,500.  It sucked watching my potential profits shrink in half the last hour, but hopefully it goes back up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:30:40
Gdax allows you to do bank wires.  I can log into my bank, make a couple clicks, and the money is at gdax within an hour.  I think my bank might have  10K limit perhaps...but that could vary per bank.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:10:03
You just got told by a bot...DAMN!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:26:40
About to hit 15,250....fuck, get the 16K memes ready.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:44:43
If I see a 15,XXX, I got another thousand I'm throwing in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:03:55
BOOM: 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:07:49
I threw down $100 at 17,880. :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:41:09
Well technically I didn't make anything as I didn't sell, but you are correct.  You can buy 0.015 bitcoin today, and if it goes up a lot in the next week, you can sell off 0.005 of it and get that cash.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:01:13
the moon?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:48:01
Ditto.  It helps to be frugal too.  I won't say my income exactly, but I save 50%
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:28:27
...and you don't lose unless you sell...but you know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:08:16
Before social media, there were forums.  Like reddit, but a little different.  Anyway, I've hung out at a pretty small forum for about 15 years now.  There's a thread, still being bumped, started in 2011.  The OP was offering to buy bitcoin at the then market price of $10, and he had his paypal ready.  That OP no longer posts, but others have claimed they talked to him a while back and he had around 400.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:18:29
It's locked in when you click.  There was a slight, short lived drop about a week ago.  I had no more cash with gdax, so I used coinbase and threw in $100 when it was $9,531.63 per BTC.  I got that today, 0.01017769 BTC, which is currently worth $146.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:54:27
I don't think 2K will ever happen again.  There's way too many people watching bitcoin.  There can be some swings like today, but the bigger the drop, the larger amount of people trying to grab them at a low cost.
...it's like a step down, but it just causes two steps up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:06:26
What do you mean "all this money?"  I'm saving for a house.  I have been for several years.  I threw in 5K about 24 hours ago because....I can risk it.  Honestly, I would just shrug and be a little pissed.  However, I don't think it's a bubble.  There might be some drops, but it's not going back sub 10K.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:01:52
If you are referring to day trading, that's going to be risky.  I'm not looking to sell today to make $200.  They say bitcoin could go up to 15K, 20K, 25K.  I'm playing with fun money, so I'm it in for the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:35:31
Hey man, things happen that you can't control.  You did what you had to do.  You can still buy into bitcoin and ride it to 100K with the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:36:57
RemindMe! December 23, 2017
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:49:54
gdax, and bank wire the funds into your account to then buy the bitcoin.
...but I have zero clue about using gdax overseas.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:19
Fuck me, I was going to swing by the bank and do a wire transfer of more funds but got busy. :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:52:38
My biggest buy in was at 13,250ish, so I didn't get that worried.  It did suck seeing my potential profits go from 3K to negative at one point.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:31:52
Holy shit man, that's insanely fucking awesome.  I wish I could just pay off some debt but you're working on changing and improving the world.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:48:29
Years back, like 08, I threw 15k into the stock market only to have it crash. I think it was worth just over 8k.  I let it ride and a few years later it bounced back. I sold it all at break even and got out. Seeing the current numbers, I shouldn't have, but oh well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:51:25
I haven't seen past 14,980 yet on gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:53:29
About 6K, if I sell all this moment, I'm up about 3K....nothing major.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:55:33
Think of US dollars to Euros.
I buy 1 euro with 118 US cents, as that's the current value.  I have 1 euro.  At any time, I could convert any amount back.  .25 euros is currently .29 US cents.  I would then have 29 cents back and still have 0.75 euro.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:57:13
I jumped on my computer for a moment and say like 16.9, 17.3, 17.7....fuck it's going up!  I quickly grabbed $100 worth at 17.8...and then it dropped and dropped.  FUCK!  Oh well, only $100.  The $100 I tossed in at 7K is doing a lot better.
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:42:11
Probably in town for the GoldRush Rally.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:02:54
Actually, you agreed to that fee, plus you made the choice to bank with someone who doesn't repay those fees for you. My debit card of choice has zero fees world wide. I've withdrawn money in probably 20+ countries and not paid a single fee ever.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:34:13
Hopefully he bought another at 3k or whatever was the recent lowest.
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:56:39
Plenty of people did the other version and bought super early.  I've been a member of a smaller car forum for about 15 years.  2 members there got in early.  One says to have had about 500-600 coins at peak, years back.  He did sell a little as prices were going up, and then more recently when it was over 10K a coin, cashed out like 100K US to pay off his house.  Another member dropped 5K into bitcoin to buy about 40, and sold over half at about 15,000.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:14:05
I still kick myself.  I was a forum junky back then.  I don't know HOW I didn't read/hear something about bitcoin.  I must have and simply didn't read into it.  My computer sucked, but I was renting where I didn't pay the power bill.  I would have had my computer mine while I slept.
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:13:58
Bitch please, I tossed in another grand at 17K, joking to myself I could sell it 24 hours later for $1,100.  I didn't...and the nit crashed to like 4K or so?
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:43:50
I'm just saying, it's why the OP got flagged.  Anything related to cuban could mean cigars, which actual cubans might still be illegal.  They have to error on the side of caution.
@_date: 2019-06-23 05:05:44
So the $500 more I tossed down at $17,500? :(
@_date: 2019-02-21 19:57:41
My account was locked down like an honest 15 years ago and I had to call.  I went from nothing in sales to like 5K in sales of $200 each in under a week.  I had to call, verify my info and give them some tracking number so they had proof I was mailing things.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:29:54
I threw down a grand on bitcoin.  I've made $45 already.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:14:12
I tossed in another grand at like 16K.  I joked to myself, "I'll throw in a grand today, sell it tomorrow for $1,100"
That didn't happen. :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:27
Got in another $100.
0.0101 BTC
Exchange rate	@ $9,531.63 / BTC
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:25:37
Same thing on paypal.  There's a company that sells leather good.  One of their colors is called "dark coffee brown" which folks online refer to as DCB.  
So if you buy a briefcase used, use paypal and say it for a "dcb briefcase" guess what paypal assume you mean?
"1,4-Dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB, p-DCB, or para-dichlorobenzene, sometimes abbreviated as PDB or para) is an organic compound with the formula C6H4Cl2. This colorless solid has a strong odor. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with two chlorine atoms (replacing hydrogen atoms) on opposing sites of the ring.
It is used as a disinfectant, pesticide, and deodorant, most familiarly in mothballs in which it is a replacement for the more traditional naphthalene because of naphthalene's greater flammability (though both chemicals have the same NFPA 704 rating). It is also used as a precursor in the production of the chemically and thermally resistant polymer poly(p-phenylene sulfide).[3]"
You're account will be locked and the payment will be suspended until you call them.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:49:09
I did about 12 days ago.  It took coinbase that long to get the money from my bank account and get me the bitcoin.  I spent $100, and it's now worth $106.25.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:12:06
Your weekly limit is probably 5K right?  Did that lower?  That's the first sign my purchase went through some 18 hours ago.  Then I got an email 5-10 minutes later.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:26:49
Yup. A friend dropped 5k and bought about 25 coins several years ago. That's 250,000 today.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:26:20
I threw down another $1,000.  I've made like $45 in the last 2 hours. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:51:51
But more so because I was into torrent.  I remember posts about "folding at home" to help map cancer research or so.
....I just don't recall ANYTHING about bitcoin, somehow.  It just seems odd to me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:22:57
I haven't, but my bank is linked.  I click and sell the bitcoin and have USD in my account.  I then click again and can transfer that to my bank account.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:48
I threw down $1,000 at like 10,500.  I'm out $145 as of right now.  Don't worry, she'll rebound. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:25:16
Fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:42
I tossed in another grand a few hours ago.  I've made like $40 last I checked.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:42:32
Yeah, it won't show for a good couple minutes.  Check your email for email confirmation.  That's a good sign.  Even then, you might have made the purchase, but you might not have access to it in your account for several days.  I threw down another $100 today and I think it said I would have it on 12/6 or so.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:09
Coinbase.  I was getting pop up errors constantly, and it took 3-4 tries to get it to say transaction complete, but it now shows and I got email confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:07:42
Nice!  I got in with $100 at like $5,500ish.  That's now worth $147 or something.  I threw another $1,000 in today and that's up $47.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:57:12
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:16:01
12,000 huh?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:14:03
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:21:35
I almost bought 1 bitcoin at $1040ish.  I was waiting for it to dip below a grand, and it never did.  Fuck. :(
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:33:27
If I think it would go back up to 17K, then I would be stupid not to buy more.
If I think it's going to keep crashing down to 1K and never return, I would be a fool to keep HODLing.
If I'm lazy, I'll just keep bitching about all the potential profits I lost by not selling at 19K as I'm not negative if I sell today.
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:26:07


Thus why I spend money on travel vs other things.  SouthWest messed up a flight I had earlier this year and gave me a free voucher.  SW now flies to Hawaii.  Thanks SW for the free trip to Hawaii.  Plus, travel doesn't have to be expensive.  I've already booked a youth hostel at $30 a night and if I want a car, Turo has options as low as $25 a day.  I'm doing 10 days and should come out under $1,000.
