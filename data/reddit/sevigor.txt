Yeah, I have a feeling it's going to skyrocket even more then...

Insurance may be expensive, but it can be a life saver. My wifes mother used to work in insurance all the time and she could not stress enough how important it is to get Umbrella Insurance. 
If you don't know what that is, it's basically insurance for anything that may be extremely expensive. Such as car accidents.

3.8 bitcoin would pay off my home right now. lol. Seems so weird because 3.8 is such a low number. Yet it's worth so much. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:18
It's been working fine for me all day...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:49
GDAX just got super laggy too rofl
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:34
*2 Minutes Later*
And back to 16k!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:03:14
Yeah, i'm not too happy about that one. I literally couldn't cancel a buy-limit order i placed because GDAX took a shit. So i got fucked and ended up buying back in at 18,750... 
Although, i think half the reason it crashed was because Coinbase committed suicide. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:08
Yeah... Kinda terrible timing with it being so damn volatile right now...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:23
Well that's super shitty. But hey! At least you're alive!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:18
It's working just fine for me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:01
Yeah, honestly i'd have to agree. Buying a car won't get you further in life. But, paying off your house will definitely get you further. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:55
Yep, everyone is watching cause the price is going crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:30:27
Get it across your ass cheeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:01:01
It blows my mind that some people have so much BTC they don't even know what to do with it. And here i am with my 0.1 BTC and feel like it's a ton. lol.
Good on you OP for Donating. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:09:23
Holy shit, That's crazy. Good for both of them. 
Someone can send me 37 BTC anytime too. lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:19
 THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?!?!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:16:01
This is NOT a good thing...
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:01:43
I like that better.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:52:55
What's happening on the 10th and 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:06
At the rate it's going today, we could see it by the end of the day lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:05
I almost did... I sold at 18k. Price instantly went to 19.5k. I put in a buy order at 18.75k. I noticed price was dropping fucking hard so i went to cancel buy order and Coinbase took a shit. So i got fucked buying in at 18.75k lol.
At least coinbase is back up now so it's probably gonna go way back up since it's low(?) now lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:28:51
Gains are gains my man! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:42:48
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:33:33
Here's the dip...
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:36:01
I honestly would have cried
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:29:53
The best time to buy is years ago. Next best time to buy is right now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:15:26
OP is high AF
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:46:15
I'd have to agree. They proven themselves numerous times in the past and continue to do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:38:43
lol. 4 years ago when bitcoin was making it climb to 1k the first time, i was heavily into bitcoin. Well, heavily for my personal income. I ended up making a few hundred bucks off of it and sold before the big crash. 
Turns out between my wallets I still had some bitcoin left. At the time it wasn't really worth much. I decided to check my wallets recently and turns out I have like a $150 bucks right now lol. Works for me!
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:07:28
Well that really fucking blows. I hope it works out man.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:25:37
To the moon!!! 
I was super confused when it just fucking blasted through $7,700. I'm also extremely happy i just bought more BTC an hour ago lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:25:43
Are you saying dogecoin is a shitcoin?!
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:51:40
Looks like we're giving that link the Ol' Reddit Hug
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:17:18
For now....
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:37:26
It's already broken records lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:41:56
It dipped pretty quickly down to 7,600. But now it's going up again. 7740 as i write this. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:12:11


Except they're only going to lose money lol. As soon as the fork is done, i'd be willing to wager most people will dump their B2X
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:36:54
Hell, I'd be ok if it went down to 3k. lol. I sold at 7,800 and i've been just waiting for it to drop more. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:35:17
Lol. Yeah, it's gonna go much higher than that. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:28:49
Yep! $7,800!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:36:46
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:39:44
I know exactly how you feel. Back in 2013 I had like 1.5 bitcoins. Too bad I sold them then. lol. Oh well, at least I did make money off of it then. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:53:41
Yep lol. It'll be hilarious to watch S2X take a massive shit.
