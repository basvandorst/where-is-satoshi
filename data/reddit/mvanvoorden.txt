Addresses are not created. All of them already exist. Every possible passphrase comes with their own wallet. That's why for example it's a bad idea to generate a wallet with your own chosen password (i.e. Brainwallet), because someone else may come up with the same and take your coins out.

I've been investing some every month and had no gains, nor losses at all. The amount of bitcoin that I have is still the same amount of bitcoin tomorrow, and the day after that, until I buy more.
Things keep costing less and less in bitcoin, though, so it has been quite beneficial.
The only way you can lose is by holding on to fiat money, which is only losing value over time. Buying Bitcoin is technically trading your old-fashioned and soon to be worthless currency into one that is its successor.
Fiat money is like coal, the only reason there's still an industry is because it takes time to transition, but in the end, nobody will use it anymore.

Al'qaeda, Taliban and Isis are all created by the USA. They've been armed and funded by either CIA or FBI.
I won't defend any terrorism, and I'm not a fan of any organized religion, which is exactly why I also go against the USA in this. They are the axis of evil, creating all the instability and wars that are going on in the Middle East right now. There would be no radical Islam in this proportion if it wasn't for the USA meddling in other countries' affairs, installing shitty dictators that give the USA cheap oil while fucking over their own populace.

I've owned bitcoin on and off since 2013. Ran out a few times, but have been able to spend a lot more money and through that extend my backpacking trip with another year, including eventually getting a car and later a van. Wouldn't have had any of it if it weren't for Bitcoin, and Ethereum, of which I held some as well, before and during the flippening hype.
For a long time already, the value of altcoins vs bitcoin has been declining. Probably at some point the ones that survive the next few years will eventually start rising again. As I'm in it for the long run this time, I have patience and will happily hold on to my alts as well.

I only started moving my holdings from the exchange to my Ledger when the value went over €5.000. Before that I knew about better ways, but I couldn't be arsed, as it was safe enough there for my liking and I could perfectly handle the loss of my funds in case that would have happened.
@_date: 2019-07-23 13:22:48
What your country did 70 years ago is not revelant to what your country is today. It's also not an excuse for the US to behave the way they do in the world, causing instability in the middle east for profit, causing instability practically anywhere arming multiple sides, while at the same time screwing over their own citizens.
Sorry, but over the last 70 years, especially the last 40 or so, your country has gone completely to shit.

It's distractions that make us weak and docile. It's quite the opposite of prosperity. It's all material, all exterior, it makes us lose connection with what's inside us, and with those around us. A slave existence paid with comfort, while the ones at the top decide who they send into battle to kill each other for their enjoyment, powered by the fear they spread through propaganda, delivered through education and mass media.
What freedom? The freedom to work and spend money, and then you even have to pay for your own coffin. Not my cup of tea, these systems are only destroying most of the life on this planet.

Since October I've been investing monthly in bitcoin and 3 altcoins. If I had invested only in Bitcoin I would have had about twice as much profit. I don't really mind, though, because I made a conscious decision to diversify and I still made a decent profit up to now.
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:00:13
No freedom on paper, true, however 90 percent is just really rural, never sees any policemen and people can effectively do whatever the fuck they want. Money is barely needed, as people grow their own food and their shelters have either been paid for or haven't cost anything in the first place.

In 2014 and 2015 I spent the last of my bitcoins at the time on hamburgers in Room 77 in Berlin. I was backpacking and wanted to be rid of my digital everything and didn't really think Bitcoin would progress any further.
In hindsight, I paid over €200 per burger, but they were totally worth it, I'd do it all again. Got new crypto in the course of 2015 and 2016, and when I started traveling again in August 2016, over the next months, I treated my stash as an endless stash of €3000. Everytime I spent €1000 on something I needed, a few months later it was back to being worth €3000. Spent the last 0.1BTC I had on 14 December 2017 to buy a van. Best deal ever, 3 days later it came all crashing down.
Back into crypto now, going along for the next round. No regrets. This time I'm going to try not to convert it to fiat, though, but offer people payment in crypto first, and use my old-fashioned bank account for fiat payments as long as there's funds in there.

I'm sure that's not true. I have some leftist friends that are supporters of antifa, and part of it, have been in this scene for a long time myself. 
Most of them are angry kids who don't see they're trying to fight fascism by using their own flavor of fascism and that through their actions they're actually aiding those groups to become more popular and grow.
No right wing intervention needed, they're doing perfectly fine on their own.

While it sounds shitty in name, I still prefer it over the pro-fascist-terrorist oppressive autocracy that's disguised as a free democracy called USA.
You'll find more freedom in Iran, despite their Islamic government. Plus, the people actually help each other out, even strangers. Go and sit on some stairs somewhere, and people will come and ask if you are alright. Go hitch hiking, and people will invite you to their homes for dinner or to stay for a few nights.
Seriously, when it comes to culture, fuck the West and their consumerist bullshit weapons of mass distraction.

No, not ignoring. Accepting it for what it is, and creating or supporting something new/alternative. Any energy spent on resistance cannot be spent on creation. On top of that, any kind of resistance is met with propaganda to make your resistance look silly or violent.

It's because whenever a pattern seems to appear, inexperienced traders  are going to act on that, which in itself changes the pattern. And daytrading is not worth the stress.
A while ago I was very happy to sell part of my btc at €7100 and bought back at €6300. Felt like a winner, but in the end it was only a 50 euro net profit on a few thousand euros worth of btc. Not worth it, better just hold and save yourself a lot of stress. If you zoom out far enough, the line steadily goes upwards.

This bill only applies to those who care about things like bills.  
Government is powered by us. Everybody who refuses to play their game means less power. Voting is playing their game, it doesn't change anything. Resistance is also playing their game, and therefore futile.  
The only way to go is to treat any divisive talk as lies and to not support or be part of any divisive action.  
Bitcoin is a way to take back control over our finances. Bills like these are exactly why cryptocurrencies exist in the first place, because they are immune for these kind of attacks. It's like blocking a tank with a chicken fence.

Yeah, and because I have dreadlocks I'm probably a hobo.
If someone wants to rob me, they'll do it for any reason. After years of backpacking, sleeping at and getting rides from strangers, staying at communities where everybody's is welcome no matter their background, I am not so afraid of getting robbed, nor losing all I have.  
And in that time I even used to have no lock at all on my phone, carrying my cryptos on there, with my mnemonics on my dropbox. Something I stopped doing by now of course, but in the end it's just money.

That's alright, they don't know or understand yet that there are no sides. So they yell they are on the other side, try to tell other people there's something like sides, and that theirs is the right one. Going against it means acknowledging there are indeed sides to all of this, and now we have a conflict on our hands.
Don't acknowledge those who claim to be from whatever side, they are not important to the cause. Going against it also gives free advertising for the other 'side', it only keeps the illusion of sides and their alleged relevance going.
In more simple words: The best way to get rid of a troll is by not feeding them. No attention, not even mentioning its existence.

They do use certain technology. Like there can be a phone, but it will be in an open space, where everybody can listen what you are talking about.  
They've also tried cars, but discovered that people would go to the cities or towns all the time, thus disconnecting themselves from the community.  
Community en connection is everything for the Amish, so when they try a new technology, they evaluate how it affects the group as a whole. Usually one or two people get to try this new technology or gadget.

There were times when I was buying on Silk Road and had 300 BTC, I never expected this to happen so never held on to any.
When it rose to about €75, i had just a few left and spent those on food.
Last year I started from zero, I used cloudmining for a bit and bought 0.5 BTC when the price dropped to €500 a few months ago. Now have 0.8BTC and am very happy with it.
I don't necessarily want 1BTC, but it would be nice milestone.

You mean something like a bank? To keep their funds safe? I can already see where that would be going and it's not pretty.
The more we take people by the hand, the dumber they will get. We need to allow people the chance to fuck up, to not take away their opportunity to learn something and become wiser.
Bitcoin is perfect as it is. It teaches to take responsibility for your possessions, and keeps up with the universal truth that you only truly own what you are able protect.

You don't need to. You set it up, keep the passphrase somewhere safe, and keep your savings in there. Keep a second wallet on your phone or pc, using an app like Coinomi, Jaxx or Mycelium, where you put some coins in like you would have in an actual wallet.

With so many new subscribers, it may not be a bad idea to review the subreddit rules to improve the quality of the posts, if the admins are interested in that.
I'd say to no longer allow ATH posts, and limit these to a daily price thread or something like that. Same for big rises/crashes with the corresponding rollercoaster or burning room gif. Those are getting old and don't really add to the discussion in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:22:36
$70 is where I sold everything the first time. "This joke has probably gone on long enough" is what I thought at the time.
@_date: 2019-12-01 21:23:44
I've done this twice after that, and slowly burned through it as an emergency fund. Over 2016 and 2017 I had kind of a perpetual 3000 euros. I'd spend 1000, and a few months later it was up the same amount again. 
Started doing the same again from October 2018 to May 2019, but because I divested in multiple coins, I'm currently at a tiny loss. Had I solely invested in Bitcoin I would be up 50 percent.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:49:10
I am 50 percent down on ADA, paid 7 cents on average. On ETH I'm down 5 percent and 10 percent on XMR. 
As I'm in it for the long run this time, I don't really mind. ADA will recover over time, I feel, as soon as there's actually something to show, and if I really need to convert some crypto when I'm out of fiat currency, I can always take out some of my BTC.

I did it while knowing it would probably not be the best option, just for the experience and to have my own real-world data to support it.

Arguably spending it creates a demand. If nobody would buy with Bitcoin, the retailer would remove the option to pay with crypto. More people paying with crypto however encourages more retailers to add it as a payment option.
Also, to be able to sell for fiat, somebody has to be interested in buying it with his fiat.

Most recently I bought a van and most of the stuff I needed for my mobile massage tent on festivals and such. I saved money on the tent, which I already regret, a better one will come soon.

Next investment will be a proper counter. I'm not the guy in the photo ;)

It's way easier to convince some journalists, who will spread the story. Even if it turns out to be false later, most people don't read or share rectifications. And when people want to verify, journalists cannot give out their sources. To protect their privacy, or whatever they come up with.

Doesn't it cost way more resources to print fiat money and have all these bank offices?

300, spent them on Silkroad in a single transaction (1BTC = $0.50). Later I had 6, spent them mostly on hamburgers at Room 77, and some acid (1BTC = $70). Had about a half one and some ETH between 2015 and 2017, that I gradually spent as an emergency fund during my travels. Spent my last 0.1 bitcoin on a van on 14 December 2016. Lucky me :)
Recently got in again, but I don't know if I'm ever getting a full bitcoin again. Especially because I divested over a few other cryptos.

I had it at $70, thought the joke had taken long enough. Also I started traveling and didn't really want to be dependent on any devices. Right now I treat crypto like some sort of savings fund for my next travels and my goal to start a healing retreat/community. Putting in a fixed amount every month and already got myself 3 free months in revenue.

I'm actually converting back and forth between btc and eth, yielding me a 10 percent profit in crypto today. Finally some movement, over the weekend the line was practically flat.

On an exchange you can define the price you want to sell for.

I am, I use only a tiny bit for it, and yes, profits aren't huge, but more than only hodling. As long as the ETH/BTC market stays at is is for the last months I take advantage of it. But yes, I'll take care, thanks :)

It's obviously clear (to me) that his sentence implies having any *significant* experience and idea what they are doing.
Like people who have had both wins and losses and know what can go wrong.

It's not easy to explain, but in some simple terms:
I have for example 0.1 BTC at an exchange, and when the ETH/BTC price drops a few percent (let's say 3), I buy a tiny amount of ETH and create a sell order for 1 to 2 percent higher. Depending on the market (sideways, falling or rising) these numbers can change a bit. For example if the market seems to be falling, I would buy when the price is 5% lower and make a sell order 0.5% higher. Usually there's these tiny spikes, even when the price is falling, and when I'm lucky, I catch one of those. If not, the sell order just stays there until the price eventually rises. This works for ETH and BTC because both usually rise and fall at the same time (and many other cryptos, too).
Apart from this, it also helps to pay attention to EMA and Bollinger bands.
There's also bots that can do this for you (but they cost money), and I actually loosely apply the logic of [Gunbot]( There's a good explanation in this topic how it works. See the 3rd post about trading logic.

As long as you keep reinvesting you have nothing, and as difficulty keeps going up as well, you won't be making that amount by November.  You'll be making at most the same amount as now, while donating Hashflare all your earnings in the meantime.
