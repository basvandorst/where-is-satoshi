It is goofy, but isn't it a good thing more people are getting on board?  I mean this thing only works if people support it.  Whether they are short sighted, play pretend, wannabe finance people or not.

Ok,  I do not own any bitcoin.  I have  been paying attention for months and honestly was just a bit sketched by the whole segwit fork bitcash/bitcoing thing.  (Which I don't understand in the least)  Though I am pretty sure it just means a ever growing ledger of agreement between holders that it holds value.  Though the it, is the actual ledger (blockchain?)   So in essence it is the monetizing of people agreeing with one another about value of value itself?  I really don't know, I mean obviously it is a decentralized monetary system without governing securities, but what it really is is still a bit elusive to me.  I guess I am not woke or whatever this meme implies.

pretty sure every century has been a century of total war.  Also Ron paul is a total whack job, don't know why anyone would want to heed his advice or comments.

This is exactly why I refrained from buying.  I am like a cooler that casinos hire to make people lose,  I didn't want to ruin it for everyone else.  Looks like you beat me to it.
