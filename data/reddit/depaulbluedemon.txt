Sell stock of EVOO. Buy Bitcoins.
(Rachel Ray obnoxiously refers to extra virgin olive oil as EVOO).

China's waking up! (It's nearly 5 am Monday in China)

Google "psychiatrists near me." It will be okay. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:20:39
No, it isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:22:26
There's nothing you can do. I don't mean to blame the victim (you), but if you've been on eBay since '96 then you know you shouldn't conduct transactions outside of eBay/PayPal. Those coins are irrecoverable.

Are you still running Core? How quickly is the blockchain downloading? Honestly, although it's a pain in the butt, replacing the wallet.dat file once you've finished synchronizing is the easiest way to access the wallet (if it's accessible). 
You can also download most of the blockchain via torrent to speed things up.

Not officially until GDAX makes it. I predict it will reach it in 104 minutes. :)

Bitcoin futures set to begin December 10.

See: MtGox.

Maximum PC for me. Ugh. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:35:24
Hasn't hit $10K on either Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken, or GDAX. :(
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:36:34
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:53:41
How does everyone else feel about giving people financial advice? I steer clear. I can explain Bitcoin to you, I can explain the risks, but I would never encourage someone to invest in anything. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:06:31
It was great until they forced BitPay integration. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:59:29
Ee vee oh oh. :'(
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:45:14
They're rare, ergo the price hike. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:35:03
No, you're insulting potential buyers with that price. It's at least 40% higher than it should be. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:44:34
Only invest what you're comfortable to lose.

Adams and Wabash. Directly in front of the Art Institute, amidst three universities (DePaul, Columbia, Roosevelt), lots of foot traffic.

Did you read anything about mining before you bought this? It is worthless:
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:42:05
Relax, your $10 is safe. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:07:28
Great news for this Polish expatriate! 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:16:47
It's just dust, so no. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:34:10
Why would you even consider doing that? Not worth it unless you're literally starving. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:24:13
Don't do it! Shady as fuck. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:36:07
Don't be ridiculous. You're sitting on like $270 dollars right now. Relax. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:54:49
A for effort.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:02:56
I would have bought some Bitcoin instead. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:33:26
How desperate are you for the money? If you need it, you need it. When is the baby due? Can you pick up odd jobs to increase your income?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:46:18
That particular auction is ridiculous. Makes me want to sell some myself, but it's too risky. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:06:15
Difficulty has increased since early November.

Venus Tramp Stamp is my favorite. Good work.
