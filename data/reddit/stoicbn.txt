What? I highly doubt this. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:16:01
I'm going to politely disagree with some of your core concepts. I don't think Bitcoin was ever truly permissionless


Okay, submit a 0-fee transaction (or any fee under the current or future minimum). You're waiting for a confirmation, you're waiting for permission to consider that transaction complete. Miners are your permission. If a billion people were using Bitcoin and you didn't pay a sufficient fee you could be waiting days or weeks for a confirmation. Permissionless would mean you have instant confirmations no matter the amount sent or recipient or network load. 
Another small example - try and make a Bitcoin purchase with Newegg *without* Bitpay's permission. You can't. Same for Dell, Expedia, etc - they don't want to directly accept Bitcoin and so you are only able to shop there because a third-party payment processor has given you permission to. As I'm sure you'll agree, this type of gateway third-party is not in line with the original visions for Bitcoin


That sounds like you need the permission of millions of people before your code takes effect. 
Bitcoin is not and has never really been permissionless, and the network is only getting further away from that ideal.

If there is little demand for Bitcoins in the first place a reduced supply won't have much of an effect. A VCR manufacturer won't double their sale price (demand) by only making half as many VCR's every year.

How do you propose doing this when every change relies on miner support? 
If you're talking about changing the mining scheme for your orphaned coin then that's fine, but the rest of the world will be following the hashpower that keeps Bitcoin secure. Users aren't going to accomplish anything without the support of the miners, end of story. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:32:04


I don't think you're making much sense. Nodes do essentially nothing, miners process transactions and have multi-million dollar investments. It's not unthinkable that miners can operate their own nodes, it wouldn't even be relatively expensive to do so. 
Let's be absolutely clear - miners are what matters. Miners vote. Nodes are just cheap computers relaying transactions, they ultimately will have no say in the economics of Bitcoin. Again, miners vote, miners have the literal (hash)power here. 


If the fees aren't high enough they may operate at a loss or simply quit, but after investing millions upon millions of dollars and controlling the majority of the hashrate I think it's economically more likely that they keep hold of the network hashrate and simply only process transactions with suitable fees. 
You can't force miners to process cheap transactions forever. They do so today because the block reward pays their bills but in the future we can't expect any miners, big or small, to work for free. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:44:11
Miners are going to act in their own self-interests, which means earning as much money as they can before the music stops. While fees remain negligible there is no real point in making sure your blocks are full, they're missing out on less than 1% of their revenue. 
When the block reward is reduced/eliminated bitcoin miners will have an incentive to include more tx's and earn fees but until then its business as usual chasing the block reward and ignoring negligible tx fees
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:04:50


It's not ME, it's a regulatory body for financial services, and I don't think too many people will have a problem with a bank not being able to conduct business if they can't borrow or provide $40k (Coinbase's CEO estimated the cost at $40k)
So, yes, if a bank can't come up with $40k or even $100k they shouldn't be handling people's money. This isn't like minimum wage, that's a totally irrelevant and invalid analogy. A better analogy would be that restaurants who can't bother to clean shouldn't be allowed to serve food. 
I'm curious what kind of "innovations" you think are being stifled by this $40k requirement. Regulation does not make "entire classes of innovation illegal", but it certainly makes unsafe business practices illegal and for that I am thankful.
 I'll ask again, since you didn't provide a specific answer - "Why would innovation and regulatory compliance be mutually exclusive?". Seriously, tell me, what innovative ideas are absolutely impossible because of a $40k barrier? See, my bank has had to comply with regulations for decades and they've still managed to do quite a bit of innovating so your argument really holds no water, it's just incessant whining that, despite emulating banks, Bitcoin companies shouldn't have to play by the same rules and apparently paying $40k means you can't have a single idea

By the year 2035, 99.6% of all Bitcoins will have been mined. By this time the block reward will be so insignificant in terms of miner revenue that they almost totally rely on transaction fees for revenue
To answer your question, once the miners exhaust the block reward they switch over to collecting (more) transaction fees

@_date: 2015-08-16 16:34:48
A fork means bitcoin splits into two separate entities - two different coins being mined by different people, one with the old properties and one with the new.
the XT fork only happens when 75% of the last 2000 blocks mined have been done so by miners using a version of Bitcoin software that supports bigger blocks. 
At this point, the fork occurs and those miners running the new Bitcoin XT actually switch their hashpower to mine XT blocks. The remaining Core bitcoin version miners would be left mining the old Bitcoin chain.
the current block limit is 1MB, meaning 1MB worth of transaction data can be processed into each block, and blocks occur roughly every ten minutes. 8MB blocks mean 8x the transaction data can fit into each ten-minute block, and so bitcoin can handle roughly 8x as many transactions per second (from 2.7 to roughly 24)
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:46:47


Isn't it true that miners have the power to neglect a transaction in favor of those with higher fees? 
In the future, with millions of people competing for space on each ten-minute block, couldn't you foresee those miners prioritizing transactions by fees paid and so only processing transactions sent by the highest bidders? 
I'm not arguing with you and totally see the sentiment you are trying to get across - in an ideal system nobody would prevent your transaction from being processed eventually - but I would hesitate to call Bitcoin permissionless until that power was taken from miners and they were forced to include transactions regardless of fee or size or sender or recipient, anything short of that requires permission in one way or another. 
Upvoted your post. Cheers!

And user support means practically nothing, so infinitely more than you think. 
All BIPs pass because of miners. 90% of user support is still 0% of hashpower. You have a lot of research to do. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:18:26


This is incorrect. The network will still be running and miners will still be validating transactions, they will simply derive *all* their revenue from transaction fees. Today transaction fees comprise only 0.5% of their revenue.

@_date: 2015-08-03 18:44:43


Let's take a look at two separate networks in the year 2035
Original Bitcoin still has a 21 million limit, which has been nearly entirely distributed (99.6%). Because the block reward is so insignificant, miners need to maintain a good revenue stream from fees, and so Original Bitcoin averages $1 per transaction.
New Bitcoin has a new limit of 42M bitcoins. Because a new subsidy is in place, miners continue to largely ignore transaction fees and rely on the subsidy for their bills. New Bitcoin averages $0.05 per transaction. 
Which network do you think people will be attracted to? Which network will see more use? I think the answer is obvious - the subsidized network is cheaper to use and the only people who are unhappy with the new limit are those hoping the deflationary plans of Original Bitcoin were going to make them rich. 
The subsidy is very important. Many people are against raising it because this scarcity is important to them, but for simple remittance and short-term holding purposes the limit is completely irrelevant and in fact undesirable. I'm sure i'll catch some downvotes for saying it but there's a reason that many economic professionals feel a deflationary economy is doomed to fail and we're already seeing the effects of that with slumping retail use.

You keep saying this but you aren't thinking about the idea very hard.

You're talking about creating a worthless alt whether you realize it or not. You can't change anything in Bitcoin without miner support - every BIP relies on it. For the last time, you can't do anything without miner support, stop kidding yourself pal. 
How exactly are you planning on passing a fork that makes ASICS useless? L-0-L. Even if your intentions are to eliminate the "bad" miners you'd be trying to push something that makes all miners worthless and I predict you'd get about 0% support for your silly idea.

The bitcoin economy runs on Bitcoin, which is by definition the longest and most agreed-upon chain. 
Bitcoin XT only occurs when a majority of miners have showed support - I'm sure you know this already. So it's strange to me to doubt that, if it occurs, it will gain favor as "the" Bitcoin. How could 75% of miners be defeated for control of the network? Or rather, wouldn't 75% agreement be considered a fairly strong perception?

You've got this totally backwards - miners define the coin. They aren't leaving Bitcoin, they're supporting the new Bitcoin. If you don't go along with them, you're the one being left behind. What the individual user wants is wholly irrelevant, that's a fact you can't seem to swallow without typing up some nonsensical hyperbole
These forks only happen *if* Miners show they support them (with a majority hashpower) so it's completely senseless to talk about miners being left behind by users. Users are powerless compared to miners.

You've got this totally backwards - miners entire incentive *is* the block reward. It is literally 99% of their income.  If it's gone then miners are living on scraps (fees) compared to now. Miners don't hold Bitcoins and hope for a surge, they mine and sell and pay their bills and take profit. 
The question is "do you want more guaranteed money or do you want to live on fees?" and you think none of the miners would agree? 
With no increase, miners eventually rely totally on fees, and without sufficient adoption these fees could be quite high, leading to Bitcoin becoming very unattractive as a payment mechanism. Miners have a very strong incentive to reduce fee pressure and another strong incentive to subsidize their operations. 
Miners would agree to it instantly, it's the holders that wouldn't. Holders rely on the limit to increase the value of their holdings, miners are just here to get as much money as they can before the music stops and it's not hard to imagine them voting to keep the music playing.

Permissionless means without permission. If you're waiting for anything or relying on anybody else it's no longer permissionless. Paying above some minimum fee is not permissionless. 0-fee transactions will basically never get confirmed, especially so when/if Bitcoin gains more users


Bitpay isn't a platform, it's a third-party payment processor. Without their *permission* you cannot shop at many retailers that apparently "accept" Bitcoin. As I said, though it may theoretically be possible, you cannot shop at Newegg or Dell without permission from and the services of a third party. 
The fact that these kinds of entities were ever allowed to exists was always a bad sign for Bitcoin.

Their interests are solely in making money. A public chain without their security won't survive so they have little to worry about. If transaction fees don't rise to meet the diminished block reward I could easily see miners voting in an increased block reward. Mining and selling Bitcoins is all they want.

Charging for taxes isn't causing people to demand fiat. The fact that every single retailer in the US accepts it, including local brick and mortar stores, is what created demand for fiat. Stability creates demand for fiat. People want local fiat currency for about a thousand other reasons beyond "we need it for taxes"


It doesn't necessarily have to be so, but it's the most convenient thing and there's basically no likelihood this changes. When people are by-and-large paid in one currency and use that same currency for every daily transaction it only makes sense to use that currency for taxes and there's little reason to start accepting Bitcoins or Microsoft Points or any other non-official monetary units

That wouldn't matter - miners vote, not nodes. And miners are the ones receiving the block reward, and miners are the ones that are going to be missing the block reward when it expires. 
Look at it another way - What percentage of miners do you think don't want free money? What percentage of miners do you think are happy to lose 99.5% of their revenue and live off of .5%? 
I doubt it will be very difficult at all for miners to vote for a new stimulus package if the economy hasn't taken off by the time the current one expires.
I know a lot of people like Bitcoin because of the set limit but without enormous worldwide adoption Bitcoin transaction fees could be fairly high with no block reward, and bitcoin is pretty unattractive as a service with high fees so it's more likely, to me at least, that miners would rather increase the subsidy than force higher fees on a smaller userbase

It isn't. They are two different cryptocurrencies with two different economical settings. One is "Bitcoin Core" with 1MB blocks and the new coin is "Bitcoin XT". They are both Bitcoin in the sense that they both continue from a single point in Core, but one chain will lose favor and die off and the winner will just be "Bitcoin". You aren't going to be seeing merchants accepting both coins or exchanges using both of them. 


You can run an XT node, you can mine bitcoins with a version code supporting XT


Well, no. Bigger blocks means you can fit more transactions in a block. More transactions in a block means more fees being collected, but not more fees *per transaction*. You'll pay more *per transaction* when the block limit (1MB or 8MB or whatever) is full or near full and you actually start competing for space in a block. 


Blocks will still be mined every ten minutes on average, but those blocks will contain more transactions than before. Rough example - if an 8MB block can handle 8x as many transactions as a 1MB block then your transaction, assuming blocks were full, could be processed 8x quicker. This isn't a fair example, though, in that your transaction speed will always relate to your fees and won't be confirmed any faster with 1MB or 8MB blocks if you don't have a high enough fee to get your transaction picked up.

@_date: 2015-08-23 22:40:38


What cost? They're already running the miners and if their chain doesn't succeed then it becomes worthless, and according to you miners will be forced to mine pittance transaction fees against their own interests?
No value? It would destroy the other chain and force the value to their own. 


Users don't give a shit which chain they are using, they care about their currency being secure.  People using BitPay or Coinbase for remittances don't give a shit, they just want it to work. Bitcoin belongs to the miners, end of story.

Thank you for your response. 


By invalid, you mean invalid to Core nodes (and merchants and exchanges), right? Won't it be valid to XT nodes and XT-supporting merchants and exchanges (aka at least 75% of the hashpower)?
The majority of Bitcoin haspower would have essentially voted to change the valid chain to one that can mine 8MB blocks, essentially voting the old 1MB block chain invalid, no? It seems you're talking about the interests of the holdout 25% as if they are the only opinions that "count" on chain validity?


Months, no? That's a lot of mining to do with only 25% of the power


Out of curiosity, why do you see them doing this once the chain has started and is being mined by 75% of the network (assuming that's the case)


Indeed 75% is quite non-negligible


I see your point, but 8% of nodes are already on XT and I think that number is trending towards equality with the 75% once all is said and done, but of course these are just our opinions. 
Now, speaking of "the economy" - I don't believe these players will have any interest in maintaining the old chain. Merchants that use third-party processors will have no say in the matter but companies like Bitpay and Coinbase will certainly protect their own interests and conduct their business on the chain with the most security and network hashpower. 


It's only logical (to me, at least) that the economy follows the security and the miners processing the transactions in a timely manner. Contrary to your statement, only the miners matter, because it's truly the miners who dictate which chain is being used in the end. A network with lesser hashpower will always be seen as vulnerable and insecure for serious commerce
Thank you again for taking the time to respond and I look forward to seeing the evolution of this forum over the coming days and weeks

This isn't necessarily true. 


It isn't "simple as that". bitcoin can continue to run with low adoption by charging higher fees, there's no reason it simply dies out in 2031. Similarly, there's no reason that miners wouldn't want to continuously subsidize their operations and maintain a low fee average, and if the new fork with a higher limit "fails" they still have coins on the old network, it's win/win for them. 


This is assuming miners are holding Bitcoins and not selling them, which I don't believe there is much reason to do. Difficulty is so high and mining is so competitive that I imagine most miners immediately sell BTC to pay bills and guarantee profit. 
In short, the ones they do mine are sold immediately and so there's little concern about enforcing a hard limit. Conversely, there's a very strong incentive for miners to create another subsidy and keep network fees nice and attractive and cheap. 
It's only the current holders that have a strong interest in maintaining the 21M limit, and current holders really have no say in the future economics of bitcoin because holders don't vote - miners do. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:24:01


No, it isn't


No, the miners would be mining Bitcoin and the nodes that stick with the 21 million Bitcoin cap would lose the majority of the network security. Nodes aren't votes, miners run the network and miners mine the transactions. If the "old" 21 million Bitcoin limit network didn't have the majority of miners it would be susceptible to a 51% attack. 


No, you're simply hosting a node. Miners confirm the transactions and actually form the network, without miners there is no Bitcoin.

I think Bitcoin is just as prone to censorship and seizures as fiat, it's just more difficult to do so. *-proof implies impossibility, but Bitcoins have already been seized by the thousands and it certainly isn't impossible for Coinbase/Bitpay to "censor" your right to spend Bitcoins at a DNM, nor is it impossible for you to be arrested for spending BTC directly with a DNM vendor.

How are 5000 paying customers "intentionally denying service"? It isn't their fault they are filling the bus' capacity. They aren't denying anybody anything intentionally, they are simply paying for their seat. 


Where's your proof this is the case? How is the bus driver to determine which paying customers have *real intentions* and which don't? I hope you can see why your argument is so idiotic considering how many gigantic leaps of logic you're making here to try and prove your ridiculous argument


Justice? What justice? The bus can hold 100 passengers and 5000 people want to use the bus. There's no crime here.


Listen - my argument isn't an argument at all - it's facts. There's no crime in paying to ride the bus with a group of friends regardless of bus capacity. There's no way to discern between paying customers who is taking up a seat maliciously or not because, like it or not, they paid for their seat.

This isn't really an intelligent sentiment. the XT fork only occurs when 75% of the network hashpower have shown they support it, so immediately XT owns 75% of Bitcoin's hashpower and the Core coin is left with 25% hastily jumping ship from their orphaned chain. 
Merchants already have their transactions settled by a third party, and surely BitPay/Coinbase will ensure their own money is safe. Exchanges are no different and have no reason to worry about the fork, they process transactions off-blockchain anyway and again will certainly be informed enough to protect their own money.

 &gt;It can't be controlled by any person or narrow group
Three mining pools in China comprise 50+% of the network, and basically two different developers are charged with the future direction of Bitcoin. 


The 21 million limit isn't impossible to change, so they can "print" more, there are just no current plans to. Maybe when the block reward runs out and fees rise miners will decide a subsidy is a good idea to keep Bitcoin transfers cheap?
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:03:57


Just to answer this question for you - 
The block reward subsidizes the bitcoin network. Fees are low now because miners only get .5% of their money from fees, the rest comes from the 21 million bitcoins being given out as a block reward. Miners sporadically mine blocks with only 1 or 2 transactions because the fees they miss out on are negligible compared to the block reward
In 20 years, 99+% of those block reward coins will have been given out, and miners will start to rely more and more on fees as the block reward peters out. If widespread adoption hasn't occurred, fees might rise considerably. If miners decide to increase the 21 million limit then they can continue processing nearly-free transactions and getting revenue mostly from the block reward. 
Basically the circumstances in which they would increase the block reward would be to further subsidize their operations if insufficient adoption isn't providing enough of a transaction fee revenue stream

I agree with them, but it's again my local health department that is doing the regulating there. 


Consumers aren't making a voluntary choice when they eat at an unclean restaurant - they are unaware of how food is being prepared or how the place is being cleaned. Are you really going to claim that consumers would willingly eat at a restaurant with unsanitary conditions and unsafe food handling practices? Sometimes a higher authority is needed to regulate this stuff. The exact same thing applies for banks - to ensure your money is being held safely and securely and properly insured


You're right...practically nobody actually has a problem with regulations, *especially in the financial sector*, except for libertarians. 


Imagine how you sound to normal people. Normal people who happily drive on municipal streets and stay alive because of auto regulations, who eat at restaurants and don't die of poisoning because of health regulations, and who store their money safely in banks because of financial regulations. You are a lunatic spewing ridiculous libertarian hyperbole and I don't know why I'm bothering to converse with such subhuman idiocy


I'm just asking you to name a single innovation that would be eliminated by a $40k requirement and you have failed. 


Did you just quote me saying something I never said, or what? The internet sure does deserve some regulation and that's why child porn isn't everywhere and my *online* bank account has been safe since the early 00's


If they were really "bought" by the financial industry, wouldn't the regulations be a lot less strict?

I think this is a bit of a misnomer. Bitcoin may have an absolute shitton of hashpower, but it's way more security than necessary. 
If you run a privatized blockchain (please read on before downvoting) and only allow certain registered users to mine then you have all the security you need and if you have more petahashes of mining power aren't going to make a difference because you can't participate in that chain anyway
Just saying, it's a bit pointless to claim Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain because while it may be true other blockchains can easily be as secure as they'll ever need to be. 
Quick example:
This "Siacoin" business posted yesterday is a centralized blockchain, and since you aren't a participant in their network then no matter how much hashpower you have you can't do shit to them. They are just as secure as Bitcoin in terms of people making changes but they don't need to waste millions of dollars of electricity to secure their network.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:27:37


Pretty much, yes. There are low fees right now because of the block reward subsidy. All other factors unchanged if the block reward dissolved today miners would have to charge 200x the current fee to maintain the same profitability. It is expected that as the block reward diminishes miners will drop out and as a result the difficulty will drop but we're still looking at miners losing an enormous subsidy they currently rely heavily on for revenue


This is very difficult to answer. With massive worldwide adoption there would be enough transactions occurring that fees would be enough revenue to satisfy mining operations, but if adoption is lacking then miners may only process the transactions in the mempool with the highest fees
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:08:32

This isn't true at all. Bitcoins are the thing that drives the Bitcoin blockchain. There are already dozens if not hundreds of other public and private blockchains that use their own incentives. Look up the company Chain - they operate private blockchains for corporate purposes
Bitcoins are simply what the network is being subsidized with to create an incentive for miners to process transactions. Companies can pay to operate their own blockchains and pay for it from fees for whatever service they are using the blockchain for - the "block reward" or payment scheme doesn't need to come directly from the blockchain itself so there's no way blockchains in general need the specific Bitcoin blockchain to exist

Failed in what way? failed to reach $5000? Cryptocurrencies can serve millions of people at any price, it will only be a failure for those determined to get rich for nothing. 
If bitcoin never surpasses 3 transactions per second then it certainly will fail. If it never passes $5000 that doesn't mean anything except that all the bitcoin experts were clueless regarding the value of these "scarce" digital tokens
All that said - No, Bitcoin will never reach $5000, or even $1000 again. VC interest is quickly fading and the investment money is now going towards private blockchain companies without such ridiculous limits (3 tps, 1MB blocks, ten minutes avg for a single confirm)
Maybe Bitcoin's 21 million coins aren't the final word in cryptocurrency - maybe the 3 transactions per second max Bitcoin blockchain isn't the world's answer to finance - that doesn't mean all cryptocurrencies have failed, it just means Bitcoin's economic parameters were flawed. 
Since I'm getting downvoted - hey u/evorhees, in 1-year and 2-years when Bitcoin is still under $1000, when will you declare it a failure? In ten years when it's *still* under $1000 but has some marginal libertarian niche usage, will you then declare it a failure?

The problem for merchants isn't the "financial flow". The only reason they accept BTC at all in the first place is because receiving the money in USD in the end is all they care about. They aren't trying to accumulate Bitcoins or pay their employees in anything but USD/local fiat
Security isn't a problem for big businesses. Overstock kept 10% of their BTC sales in actual Bitcoin and never reported a hack of any kind - the problem is price volatility. On their 2015 Q1 financial statements they reported a $117,000 loss on cryptocurrency holdings, meaning they probably finally sold off the 10% they've been holding at a gigantic loss. Until the price sees years and years of stability no regular merchants want to subject themselves to such losses.

The block reward *is* a charity - without it transaction fees would need to be orders of magnitude higher in order to compensate miners for the rising difficulty. The block reward subsidy keeps transaction fees low, which is one of Bitcoin's biggest appeals with the expectation that adoption would be enough to substitute the block reward with tx fees


The block reward is not needed to validate transactions or prove their work - how do you expect the Bitcoin network to function in the future when the block reward is dissolved? 


You have no idea how "private blockchains" work if you think they need to worry about security - it's a centralized, permissioned ledger - if you aren't registered you can't interact with it and if you *do* maliciously fuck around as a registered participant they roll back your changes and revoke your permissions. 
Again, there is no need for a block reward. The block reward exists for Bitcoin to give miners a reason to mine, bankers don't need an incentive directly from the system when they can charge fees to users for transactions on their system. . there is no need for a block reward or a halving in a private system, and as a matter of being private they dont need to worry about security. Bitcoin miners can't touch the network if they aren't permissioned
 The bitcoin block reward is nothing but charity, because transaction fees couldn't possibly be high enough to pay for electricity costs (they would be $10+ per transaction) while the banks have no difficulty to worry about nor ridiculous energy costs nor an expectation that transactions be nearly free which is what necessitates the block reward in the first place 
@_date: 2015-09-11 02:27:53


It's as secure as they need it to be. With a private blockchain the only people that are allowed to mine/process transactions are registered users. The entire point of the private chain is that companies can control it, you're saying that like it's undesirable. If you give an actor permission and they try to do something malicious you roll the whole chain back. The control you're talking about is the entire appeal of private blockchains, and also explains why they are perfectly secure for the purposes they were built


And no central entity can control it, and nobody can create a block faster than 10 minutes. private chains can be made to handle 1000's of tx's and do so in 1-minute blocks. 


How is it insecure if you can't participate without permission?


The purpose of a blockchain is duplicate recordings and immuability, not necessarily a lack of a third party creating rules for that private chain. The ideals of Bitcoin are not the ideals of every blockchain, something you obviously need to learn


And yet all that processing power can't do anything to stop people from stealing bitcoins or clogging the network - private blockchains make the recent Coinwallet stress tests impossible and are still imperviously secure to non-registered users. 
Honestly you obviously know nothing and didn't bother to think at all about how a private blockchain might function or the benefits of such. Chinese miners wasting millions of dollars mining Bitcoins doesn't mean that Bitcoin is the only secure blockchain in the world

Blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain are only 1MB,  and so can only include a limited amount of transaction data per blocks. 1MB worth of average transactions every ten minutes amounts to a capacity of roughly 2.7 transactions per second.

The block size being full and the price changing can happen independent of each other. The stress tests from weeks ago showed that the block size needed to be raised already - companies using other blockchains because Bitcoin can't handle the traffic is another sign. 
The price went up because of a Russian-orchestrated ponzi scheme encouraging people to buy Bitcoins. This buying raised the price, lending legitimacy to the ponzi scheme and drawing in more buyers.

So miners sell every single coin to pay the power bills?  
It doesn't matter when you choose to sell, when you see a lack of buyers your peers will sell and you'll see the price dropping and eventually give out and stop holding that bag. 
You and everybody else interested in bitcoins is buying as many as possible before the halving. This demand is equal to $290 /BTC. That's as much as current demand can make the price go up. Demand before the halving is obviously going to be higher than it will be after the halving when it has occurred and the price hasn't magically risen 2x on every exchange from, what, a sudden explosion of post-halving buying 
Explain to me - if the price is going to rise, when will it happen?  Before the halving?  That means more demand, not constant. If that means more demand, where does it come from?  If it's coning from greedy new money to get in before the halving, where are those buyers now?

See if a price increase was guaranteed them everybody would be buying to double their money, but it isn't and so they aren't. The halving is only a reduction of the block reward subsidy, it doesn't automatically mean miners can expect to sell Bitcoins for twice as much. First, the public perception of bitcoin has to change so much that they actually respect the scarcity and value and feel a reduction in supply means something
The idea that the halving means the price will double with no other changes in public sentiment from today is the dumbest thing I've read here bar none.

No, I'm attempting to determine what new use-case will cause people previously uninterested or without need for Bitcoins to buy. It is quite obvious what Bitcoin users want Bitcoin for - to get rich. In case this is news to you, the price can't substantially rise with only the buyers involved in the system now, there are billions of people out there who need to adopt Bitcoin in order to see appreciation. Are you, personally, going to keep up this level of demand? Of course not, nor will anybody who has already invested a signficant portion of their money into Bitcoin. To keep demand constant you need fresh money and to get that money you need attractive use cases beyond what is already available to people - in short, you need to give people a reason to consider Bitcoin's scarcity a factor. 
You're confusing the current price of Bitcoins with a supply and demand equation when the current price is more based on speculation and manipulation than actual worldwide demand.
Bitcoin users value each coin at $290, ask your neighbor what value he gives Bitcoin - it is likely $0. Ask your parents, likely the same. These are the people who's money you need in order to buy Bitcoins after the halving. If the halving indeed fails to cause appreciation many will abandon this investment since this event is expected to increase the value but it's a truly mindless expectation without being able to describe what significant use-cases will draw new buyers to Bitcoin
Put it another way - how can you expect this appreciation to occur when the economy is comprised of people who already own Bitcoin? Once you've stocked up your coins for the halving and that demand from existing users subsides, how are you drawing new money and people in?


You're going to learn a very harsh lesson about definitive facts after the halving. All of my reasoning will become crystal-clear to you after you realize yours was so ridiculously off-base


Ask yourself - why do you demand Bitcoins today? now eliminate any answer that can be accomplshed already with fiat - what are you left with? Speculation. You demand Bitcoins today because you expect they will appreciate, particularly because of the halving. You and many others share this reason of demand. 
Now, when the time comes and the halving doesn't do anything, you've just lost a significant source of demand. People aren't buying Bitcoins as an inconvenient way to shop at Amazon or to pay rent, they are mostly buying it in hopes of getting rich. When this hope dissipates it's hard to imagine average consumers having any significant demand for Bitcoins considering it adds nothing to their lives.

How is there going to be less selling pressure? Miners are going to need to sell as many, if not more of the coins they mine to pay the same bills. There will be less profit taking because there will be less profit - this isn't a good thing. 
Speculators have already priced it in otherwise you'd have enormous amounts of buying now before the halving...but volume at most exchanges has never been lower. 
By the way...bitcoin has pumped and dumped several hundred dollars up and down over the last year and the masses still don't care. Bitcoin had its time in the spotlight and hasn't been in the news again despite some fair gains. The masses you are talking about are not paying attention to and will never buy Bitcoins, they have no use for them .

If you understood basic economics you would understand changes to Supply and Demand don't always equally correlate. 
Reduced supply would raise the price on a good consumers *need* in their life - in what way will a reduced supply increase this need in consumers? It won't, because a reduced supply doesn't change the utility of Bitcoins, and so reducing the supply, even with consistent demand, will not necessarily result in appreciation. 
Not to mention most of the "demand" today is whales on no-fee chinese exchanges trading back and forth to create the illusion of actual order books.

Not a single new major retailer has begun accepting Bitcoins this year.  The best you can do is hold your Bitcoins in a company just like a bank and spend them anywhere through an intermediary but people can already keep money in a better-insured bank and already spend their money anywhere
I'm open to answers but I don't see what's going to change in the next year to change peoples perceptions of Bitcoins from a lesser system than the one they use already to one so superior they have to buy as many units as possible. 
You say the truth is no-one knows but anybody with a minor understanding of economics will understand that reduced supply doesn't automatically equal an equivalent change in demand 
In fact, I would suggest the people who think a reduced block reward means a higher price have never taken am economics class in their life, because nobody with even a modest understanding of the field would assume things are so black and white 
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:14:30
"The needs of day to day use increases"
This hasn't happened. Nobody **needs** bitcoin, less of something they don't need today means nothing. The supply of coins isn't dwindling, only the block reward subsidy. There are 14 million other coins out there and a serious lack of mainstream interest that isn't set to change anytime aoon
You can't expect people to value scarcity alone, they have to have an actual need for that good or service and most people simply don't have a need for Bitcoins at all
 
Trust me, the halving will happen and you will see that "the trolls" have been right all along about the lack of value to Bitcoins arbitrary and artificial scarcity 
@_date: 2015-10-25 16:18:31
Do you have a logical reason why people wouldn't have boughtnin already if the halving was going to double the price?  What's the logic in waiting a few months higher?
You'll see fairly soon, this isn't a fallacy, its reality. A reduced miner subsidy will accomplish nothing to attract new people to Bitcoin and you'll discover the real fallacy was the idea that Bitcoins price would double.

@_date: 2015-10-14 13:51:40
We don't, though. If adoption doesn't pick up fairly soon (by the time the block reward diminishes, 20 years tops) then tx fees won't be enough to cover the enormous mining costs and each tx could cost $5-10
You can see this yourself by visiting blockchain.info/stats and checking out the average cost per transaction right now. With the block reward subsidy gone miners will expect similar revenue simply from fees

@_date: 2015-10-25 16:24:00
I doubt your conclusion - the very nature of Bitcoins means that people will always want to wait for a higher price. A rally to $400 isn't going to force people who bought coins at $600 to spend and if you have a lower cost average you'll still defer the spending until some imagined day in the future where Bitcoins are worth thousands. 
The really unfortunate part is that retailers don't care about this, they just want the sales they were promised. Telling them you're waiting for a rally is no consolation when they were told how much money Bitcoin will save them and it ended up being not worth the effort . you won't see them accept again when or if the price rises and they hear the same false promises

A "supply shock" doesn't exactly matter so much when there isn't significant demand in the first place
Its not hard to see the halving won't do anything to raise the price unless something makes Bitcoins significantly more valuable than artificial scarcity between now and then 
If Microsoft claimed they were running out of Microsoft points and the cost was going to double, would that make sense to you?  This is exactly why nobody in the masses really cares how scarce Bitcoin is - they don't need it for anything anyway

Not until people like you don't even have the hope to make threads like this. 


Billions of dollars is not peanuts for a currency that retailers see practically no use from and that sees very little actual economic use. There's no importance behind the "market cap" because that's just a multiplication of Bitcoin's 21M limit - other cryptocurrencies (or Bitcoin)  could be successful at any price per "coin" and with any number of coins so it's totally irrelevant


Like? I'm not trying to troll but the only things I see going on, err, not behind the scenes are others co-opting Bitcoin's technology for their own use. 


Okay, but it's been months already and as I alluded to in the previous point Bitcoin is slowly losing first mover advantage here


If the light you're talking about is a fortune of money there may or may not be a light and constantly assuring people they will get rich from this is a terrible image to portray


This is nothing but a reduction of the subsidy paid out by the network - Bitcoin scarcity is something yet to be proven valuable by the general public and producing 1/2 of something people don't care about won't make it twice as valuable or any more valuable at all. 


Anybody who feels like browing your post history can verify this number to be a gross exaggeration of your actual accuracy in predicting the direction Bitcoin is heading.

Nobody cares about scarcity if they don't find Bitcoins valuable in the first place. If you aren't willing to buy something one day you won't care to buy it the next unchanged. Scarcity only comes into effect if the scarcity is respected and valued - this isn't yet the case with Bitcoin
Ive typed this a half dozen times in the past two days but if scarcity was really a factor why wouldn't people be buying like crazy already?  Unless Bitcoin changes between now and then to offer them something different they actually need it for the average consumer won't have a need before or after the halving and the arbitrary scarcity won't mean anything.

And how is Bitcoin supposed to become ubiquitous? Retailers don't want it, so an intermediary is necessary to be able to spend it essentially anywhere.

The benefit of adopting bitcoin has likely been closer to 0 than the costs. Bitcoin payments require customer service inquiries and work, that time is not free, nor is the fee charged by Bitpay. Bitpay in particular has been laying off employees and losing clients, you're overly optimistic about a poorly performing company. Bitpay likely has less than 12 months and are already looking to partner, Coinbase operates an exchange and makes some more revenue from.that.

I'm making a bit by not buying bitcoins now because I know they won't significantly appreciate and my money is better invested elsewhere. Its confusing to me why you admit the halving may not cause a rally but then refer to this situation as "impossible" - it is very possible. If the entire world was interested in bitcoins and the limited supply matters then you might see a rise but they don't care about them and so less bitcoins being mined doesn't mean anything to most people, nor is the block reward the only supply of Bitcoin - 70% of the 21 million are already in the wild and if people valued the scarcity like you wish they did people would be scrambling to own a whole coin - but they arent. 
It's a grand delusion that making half of something people don't care about will double the value of that thing

That's idiotic, eating is a necessity and people have non-deflationary fiat to buy lunch with. The idea that people will defer spending Bitcoins is not a fallacy, it's reality. How long they wait to spend is irrelevant, the fact is they are waiting so long that retailers aren't seeing any sales and are slowly starting to stop accepting Bitcoins. 
People petitioned retailers to accept BTC and then the price dropped and so nobody wants to spend. Again, not a fallacy, just the harsh reality. Once these businesses give up on Bitcoin they aren't likely to start again on the same false promise that bitcoin sales will be booming.

It doesn't matter much that large retailers Bitcoiners rely on for the answer to "what can I do with these?" are dropping Bitcoin? Get out of denial dude, it matters very much for a currency to have some places that accept it. Microsoft lended an enormous amount of credibility to the economy here. 


10 months ago when it happened it was far more than a bit of marketing but par for the Bitcoin course to downplay the hell out of any legitimate bad news. Most known retailer no longer accepting BTC? No big deal!


Who uses Bitcoin to shop at all? Apparently nobody. With no stores accepting them there's less reason to buy any and less likelihood they will appreciate at all. It's a waste of Bitcoins to use them, best to hold them forever until nobody accepts them and they are inexplicably worth millions, nailed it!

You should bring it up with your professor, its a great economics class topic. However, it sounds like you think you can enlighten your classmates when the likely conclusion an economics class will draw is that a deflationary economy is doomed to fail .
Be sure to mention how after several retailers accepted BTC in 2014 no large new retailers began accepting in 2015 and several of the ones from 2014 reported dwindling sales and have since discontinued acceptance. You should also mention that Overstock attempted to hold Bitcoins for business use at a rate of 10% of their sales and reported losses of $117k on this investment in their q1 2015 financials . as a result, overstock no longer holds any bitcoins from sales whatsoever

Exactly this. If a "better" blockchain exists or these companies can find a use for blockchain technology without having to buy Bitcoins that's no reason to act deceptive and bust out the childish means. 
The big problem is that by not using Bitcoin the scarcity value of the 21 million bitcoins goes in the toilet - 1 Bitcoin or even 1 satoshi is no different than any other unit of any other blockchain for notary/accounting/clearing purposes and if the 1MB/3 tps Bitcoin blockchain doesn't currently suit their needs it doesn't mean they misunderstand the technology and are bound to fail

There are billions of people in the world, all of whom need to make multiple transactions per day...I don't see why achieving Visa-like capabilities of tens of thousands of transactions per second is unnecessary. Even that is hardly enough. 
As it is, Bitcoin can't handle as much traffic as a single large Wal-mart store does on an average day.
The *why* - Companies are already looking away from Bitcoin and to private or permissioned blockchains - partially because they desire some level of control but also partially because Bitcoin can't handle high-frequency trading or the kind of traffic they need.

I don't understand why everybody seems to think Bitcoin is outside of economic thought. You can easily place Bitcoin into categories - it is digital, it is deflationary in the long term, it exists with no backing. This doesn't mean Bitcoin breaks any of these categories or that Bitcoin won't act exactly as they expect something deflationary to act. 
The honest truth of it is that bitcoin owners don't like the conclusions that intelligent people draw and so they try to discount their opinions as uneducated or incapable of understanding 
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:16:27

Cryptographic proofs can't tell you which coins are stolen, lost forever, unusable.

What is bitcoin but creating wealth out of thin air, then?  Faith in fiat is not totally unfounded, you can earn it and spend it anywhere and use it for taxes and property. Expecting people to have faith in Bitcoin, which isn't even backed by a country. Isn't always reasonable.

The block reward is not the only source of Bitcoin supply. 


The general population is yet to (and may never) come to this conclusion


The thing you are missing is that Bitcoin scarcity isn't a problem. Nobody is so in need of Bitcoins that they are scarce, and you can accomplish most blockchain functions with as little as a single satoshi

It can't thrive as a store-of-value if only the 2-5 million Bitcoin users in the world are willing to recognize any value at all, and this NASDAQ thing is kind of saying that Bitcoin itself isn't suitable for asset transfer applications so, no, at 3 tps, it cannot thrive on asset transfer. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 12:30:22
The tokens only serve a purpose, to confirm that a transaction has taken place. They don't need a value pegged to BTC, only to the network itself (like 1000 units) 
If something is "tied to BTC" without storing any anywhere then it has nothing to do with Bitcoins and is a separate chain, not a sidechain in any way.

You're mistaken again here, there isn't anything inherently difficult to grasp about Bitcoin. Again, the conclusions drawn by these people (after grasping Bitcoin) are typically negative and so you rely on this idea that they must simply lack understanding *somehow* otherwise they would agree with you. 
The bashing of economics and economists in this subforum is downright childish. Ask BitPay and Microsoft how wrong economists are when they say a deflationary currency will have low retail sales. Ask the remittance startup CEO's how wrong economists are about Bitcoin's remittance uses

Honestly, that's irrelevant. Bitcoin is secure but a private entity doesn't need anywhere near that much computing power to secure a private coin. If facebook manages the entire ledger it doesn't matter how much hashpower the Bitcoin network has, either way both coins are secure. The millions of dollars in electricity used every month mining Bitcoins in the name of "security" is a bit of a red herring when it comes to cryptocurrency security, hashpower only matters for publicly-accessible coins. You won't be able to mine/process FacebookCoin transactions, that would be done internally and since there's no competition there's no difficulty rises and no insane power consumption

I guess nobody told the Bitcoin accepting retailers this was the case?  How can am economy expect to gain traction if nobody spends or uses the currency?
You can't definitively state that LBC data is the only important metric, it isn't, and if spending doesn't increase nobody will have anywhere to use all those accumulated coins 
I assure you that continuous expenditures are crucial to Bitcoins success and can't imagine why an otherwise intelligent person would claim such
Regular Bitcoin sales are absolutely an important metric, if you asked Dell or Microsoft how Bitcoin adoption is going they would likely have assumed adoption had ceased considering how little spending they've enjoyed. I don't know if this is news to you but expenditures are a very important part of how you measure the health of an economy

The word decentralized isn't in your quote
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:59:54
It's pointless to bring up "textbook" supply and demand. As I've explained thoroughly, there are too many factors at play to consider that. Bitcoin isn't a consumable product, it isn't a Ferrari or a diamond or an *actually rare* thing, it's digital and invisible and as a result supply and demand become complex concepts beyond "I'm bringing less apples to the market so I can sell them for more". 
The supply of Bitcoins is, in many ways, totally irrelevant. It's the utility you can achieve with each Bitcoin that is most important. If, as an individual, you have no need for Bitcoin in your daily life, the utility value of each bitcoin to you is 0 irrelevant of the supply. If companies can achieve with their own private network everything Bitcoin had hoped to offer their valuation of Bitcoin will remain 0. As a nonproprietary open-source software there's nothing stopping anybody from using all the benefits of Bitcoin tech without buying or using Bitcoins, which explains all the blockchain (not Bitcoin) startups getting VC now - the technology is useful *but* you don't necessarily need to buy 1 of 21 million Bitcoins in order to use it. If you *did* **need** to buy Bitcoins then the reduced supply might mean they become more valuable but, and here's the entire point, really - 
You don't need Bitcoins to accomplish what Bitcoins (blockchains) can accomplish. A decentralized network can be created and recreated and the benefits of such can be enjoyed publicly or privately without being obligated to secure a part of the Bitcoin network.

I never said any of these companies failed - I said Bitcoin as a payment method has failed. Microsoft, Dell, Overstock, etc are all still very much in business.

There aren't any multi-million dollar Litecoin mining farms, Litecoin's halving is nothing relevant to what will happen to Bitcoin mining. 
Again, some of us do know before the fact because it's quite obvious that demand isn't going to suddenly double nor will people be willing to pay double for a digital currency they currently find useless. To everybody else the results will seem obvious only afterwards as they wonder how they ever thought it was logical to imagine that consumers would pay twice for a commodity one day what they weren't willing to pay anything for the next. From one day to the next Bitcoin will offer no additional functionality or utility, so there's no logic in expecting an appreciation in price. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 11:35:44
People who have been "accumulating" are still a source of supply. Miners rewards are not the only source of supply, you know, and this is exactly what a reduced charity/subsidy/block reward won't result in a higher price

Pretty good article, but it talks about how adoption might increase if you could spend Bitcoin in the same stores you can send fiat. I don't think this is enough of a driver.

Why are you assuming that every Bitcoin mined is sold? 


Doesn't hold water - Bitcoin has been all over the news, tv, movies - people have heard about it. The problem is they have no need for it, and that isn't likely to change between now and the halving. There is literally no way the halving isn't already priced in, it's been a known even since the beginning of Bitcoin.
To stimulate conversation, what factor do you think will cause people to realize they need Bitcoins between now and the halving? What use case will lead to this mass "discovery"?
@_date: 2015-10-10 22:44:24
I'm saying there's a lot more supply in the world than the amount of subsidy miners receive. There is a cut in one source of supply, still dozens of places to buy any of the 14 million bitcoins already mined 
I feel qualified to opine on this because I've actually studied economics in college...have you?  
@_date: 2015-10-10 22:46:17
So the price won't rise until people have a use got Bitcoins and people only buy when the price is rising...

@_date: 2015-10-25 20:00:18
It's okay, you'll see, and you can apologize later I suppose. You have a very serious misunderstanding on economic fundamentals if you think less of a subsidy is going to do anything to cause people to buy. If what you believe was true there is absolutely no reason those same people wouldn't already be buying, the halving is a known and certain event and so it makes no sense to wait a month or two beforehand, presumably when the hype would already be occurring. The truth of the matter is you'll set those goalposts as far away as possible so you don't have to face the reality of the truth until the last few weeks
If Ford announced that they just lost some government subsidy and would expect to charge 2x for their vehicles, who would pay? Consumers aren't responsible for offsetting the block reward subsidy, if adoption isn't enough in tx fees to offset it then miners lose money, you can't reasonably expect people to pay double for no reason other than the fact that miners are being compensated less for wasting electricity. 
A reduced supply will raise the price when the good is something people *need*. Nobody *needs* Bitcoin, they can shop anywhere and pay their bills and save or invest their money without it, so how can anybody be expected to give a shit that the Bitcoin-printing-presses are slowing down?

What if you need 10MB blocks? What if you need 1 min blocks? What if you need 10,000 tps? You can't use Bitcoin so you create your own blockchain. Bitcoin is a blockchain but not a very good or capable one, just coincidentally the most popular. It doesn't suit the needs of these banks or businesses

This is a pointless distinction. If the problem is converting X to USD, then Bitcoins make things better as much as sending cell phone cards or food stamps - there is still a conversion necessary and without that conversion you haven't made an apples-to-apples remittance. 
Yes, I can send you Bitcoins in ten minutes, but you have to convert them to spend them locally. If you're going to claim simply receiving those Bitcoins is comparable to remittances then I can send you a code redeemable for prepaid cell phone minutes and also claim I've revolutionized remittances, you just need to find somebody to accept or convert them
Do you understand what I'm saying? There are many things you can transfer instantly across the world but if you can't universally use it for commerce then it isn't especially relevant

If I sent someone in Europe a code for Playstation Plus they could probably figure out how to barter with it but that doesn't mean it's good for remittance. The entire idea of remittance is sending home local money that can be used everywhere for everything. 


NO. It will be a long time (forever) if Bitcoin never gets adopted. Adoption isn't an eventuality, it's a possibility, and so Bitcoin may never gain the foothold it needs to accomplish anything. I hate to bring it up but Bitcoin hasn't been doing good in retail, remittance or in convincing the general public that rare Bitcoins are actually rare or valuable.

I don't see the relevance in deflecting Bitcoins use for crime as similar to the USD - Bitcoin is like cash but online, and so its not only useful for buying from a local dealer but essentially has opened the door for pseudononymous global drug dealing. 
But hey, a use case is a use case

A price increase is only the "most likely " scenario if you have no understanding of economics and just want to pretend the whole world is already gaga over Bitcoins - they aren't, nobody really cares about how much or few Bitcoins are being created any day because they don't need them at any price 
If I bring ten apples the market one day, can I automatically bring five the next day and expect to charge double?  Why not?  The apples are so scarce, after all.
The point is artificial scarcity isn't valuable unless you can convince people it is - current bitcoin owners are convinced but the much larger population of people who don't own Bitcoins don't care about the scarcity and likely never will, which means a price increase from a reduced artificial supply means fuck-all to the people you need to convince 
If the most likely scenario was a price doubling why wouldn't everyone be buying now?  The price is already "low", isn't it?  It'll be one month before the halving, and then one week, and then you'll realize nobody is guaranteed a price doubling every halving and it was quite stupid to presume so

Why? No (noteworthy) new retailers accepting BTC this year, severe decline in VC, several Bitcoin companies "pivoting" away from using Bitcoin at all (Bitreserve, Beam, Changetip) - Overstock was the poster child for accepting BTC and they no longer hold any amount. Declining volume on the exchanges, increased interest in blockchain technology separate of the Bitcoin experiment - there are a ton of signs that Bitcoin has peaked or otherwise stagnated into it's own death here.

Bitcoin is *a* blockchain, not the incentive structure for every blockchain. To directly disprove your claim the incentive structure for the private chain Liquid is monthly subscription fees - not a block reward and not bitcoin. There are many ways to subsidize a blockchain, issuing Bitcoins from thin air isn't the only way 
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:15:20
You aren't making a very compelling argument. Public sentiment of Bitcoin isn't improving, media attention has been stagnant and VC money is now going to blockchain companies and not Bitcoin companies. Feel free to buy now, it just means you'll have a cost average in the high $200's when the next dump occurs

Why? because as a bitcoin owner you stand to gain nothing? It obviously meets their needs as a business
@_date: 2015-10-24 17:44:09


Because hundreds if not thousands of people haven't already had their Bitcoins stolen? Sorry but your argument holds no water. 


I have lots of money...in the bank. I don't have to worry about keeping it safe, they do that for me. I even have so much they don't charge me monthly fees! It's pretty nice considering if your Bitcoin account gets emptied you are SOL and if my bank account gets accessed I have FDIC insurance and 0 liability.

You aren't making a lot of sense, very vague post. Traditional economists will tell you Bitcoins deflationary nature means people wont want to spend them and we see this confirmed as true with the low retail sales reported by merchants following adoption. Bitcoin isn't some new paradigm that economists don't understand its that's Bitcoin owners don't like economists opinions on Bitcoin, correct as they may be, and so they convince themselves that old school economic fundamentals do not apply even though Bitcoin is already proving that they do

How is something private vulnerable to anything? How are you going to "attack" a private chain you have no access to?

You're delusional if you think Bitcoin demand will remain constant after the halving has failed to deliver. 
Where's the logic in your reasoning?  People already interested in bitcoin will have bought as many as they can before the halving, exhausting that demand. You won't buy more after the halving with hopes of a great appreciation like you would be before, though this same volume is absent now. People already know and don't care about bitcoins and so simply dropping the supply won't cause these people to demand bitcoin at all, and the type of people already buying bitcoin now   are only causing the price to hover around $300 so where is the price-doubling surge going to come from?  
As far as I can tell Bitcoiners just believe this increase to be some self-fulfilling prophecy that they are going to be buying into themselves but cannot explain where new money is going to come from once the halving fails to deliver and speculative hopes have been dashed
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:16:54
There is absolutely no logic in that statement. Demand isn't a never ending stream of paycheques coming from the same people, , you need some new factor to interest new people. People buy bitcoins in hopes of making money, when that doesn't occur as a result of the halving like you believe it will bitcoin sales will drop further as less people buy as an investment. 
To put it another way the price is $290 today because there are enough people buying Bitcoins today knowing about the halving and potential future mania to sustain that level. If more people believed the halving was going to raise the price then the price would obviously be higher today. Since the price won't magically double the day of the halving, you have to presume that buyers would accumulate everything they can beforehand, but the same knowledge those buyers would have, they have today - that is to say the price before and after the halving will be roughly the same because the people who believe in the halving will have already bought in much earlier and the people who dont have no interest or need in bitcoin and a supply change is irrelevant to their demand

Bitcoin is a blockchain and anybody using it for any purpose should be impressive, not only the chain you may personally stand to gain money from gaining in popularity. Bitcoin technology is open source and so cloning wasn't necessary and "core features" is subjective - there is nothing sacred or special about 1 mb blocks, 21 m total units, or any other aspect of bitcoin.

What micro-transactions are you even talking about? This is just regular commerce, dude. Bitcoin's blocks aren't nearly at capacity, it's not like we can't spare the extra activity. Your arguments aren't making any sense. 


Why is cash aka gold? You may value the scarcity and consider it a digital gold but not everybody does and with no retailers to spend it they are less likely to see the value in owning some in the first place. The appeal for many is commerce with no oversight, not simply a store of value to hoard forever until you're inexplicably rich for your inaction. 


What's the relevance of this? Future developments will allow bitcoin to handle large traffic volume but by then many retailers will have already passed up on accepting BTC. This isn't something you get multiple shots at
It's honestly kind of stunning to me that you you used the "we don't have the capacity" excuse for this - Bitcoin can easily handle twice the spending that was occurring at Microsoft, the problem wasn't the capacity it's the lack of use. What resources was Microsoft wasting by converting BTC to USD? 
You need to accept reality - Bitcoin needs stores to spend it at in order to gain legitimacy and stores bowing out this early is inarguably a bad thing.
