One thing I have noticed is that Bitcoin trading is pretty transparent. It seems to me that people day-trading are not comfortable holding thier assets through the night. Thus they liquidate at the end of the day ( Consitently large volume around 16:00:00 - 18:00:00 PST ). So think long term, filter out the noise, don't panic, sell if fundementals/beliefs change etc. It will crash again, and probably 10 times before the end of day. Dollar cost average, lower your cost basis. blah blah blah.

It will drop again, and test 550 a few more times. Too much uncertianty to drive it up, but I think there is enough interest in Bitcoin to keep it from falling below it as of the moment. (See ~20k bid volume between 550-620 as opposed to ~5k ask volume between 645-715). Seems oversold atm.

Anyone having difficulty verifying credit cards? Every time I try I get "Error2: Address Doesnt Match" ... strange. Im 100% sure I have the correct address.

I'm convinced the current floor is 600-650's. There is a tremendous amount of [bid] limit orders sitting in that range. I think that explains the dips/snap-backs. Expect volatility. Good news, if someone comes along and drops a 1000 Btc market order[sell] there is enough liquidity to maintain price (in that range). No one knows for sure, but I'm convinced we wont see sub 650 prices for an extended period of time (in the short term).
