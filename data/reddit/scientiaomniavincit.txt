The [first one]( literally says this in the subheader:






And Forbes is Forbes...

Yeah, this is such a relieving perspective. I feel like I should just keep adding to my wallet, however much I can. But the feeling of missing out on "easy money" (if I am lucky) by "riding the wave" is just overwhelming at times. Especially when a correction is so obvious, such as right now. 
But this relieved me a little. Thanks a lot.

Wow. Are you planning to buy those without selling right now? So will you HODL and add, or will you sell now and then buy back? 
Average costing seems to be the best way. But when the prices are this high, the weekly/monthly purchase levels needs to be high too. It won't really help if I buy just $100 every month. $1-2K might be a good amount.

I guess the more I think about it, the more I come to this conclusion too. But then, the feeling of certainty changes when it comes to action. :D It's so shitty.

Can someone explain why this sentence is wrong (or why it should not be taken seriously):

So a question: When is your buyback limit? When are you planning to buy? 
This is my fear: I say I will buy back in $6800-7200 band, let's say. And the price comes down to $7400. And I wait. And the price surges again to $12000. When do you say "Okay, I am buying back now."
I have lost some money by trying to play this game before. So I am pretty lost at this point. I don't know any better than just HODLing.

Does it make mathematical sense? I can't decide on a good strategy.

Yeah but is it normal for it to have such a huge difference from the other exchanges. I wasn't sure... Thanks!
