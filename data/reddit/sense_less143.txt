This thread should be pinned or added in FAQ, imho. Bitcoin debit card is a handy tool
@_date: 2016-04-18 10:14:57
I want to know more about Bitcoin and Islamic finance. Also, anyone know the update with Blossom Finance? 
@_date: 2016-04-21 03:11:58
You can buy bitcoin with paypal.
otherwise localbitcoins is your solution.
@_date: 2016-04-21 14:52:55
Reason? Curious

How's this for a prediction- Chinese miners prepares to celebrate Chinese New Year holidays in late January/early Feb. In result, there will be a lot of btx dumped in market as they prepare for extravagant celebrations.. 
(Hmm, I want to check the past Januaries and Februaries if this is even a trend)
@_date: 2016-03-14 05:00:24
I don't get this reference, can someone explain?
@_date: 2016-03-20 02:47:30
Get a bitcoin debit card, then as you make payment wink at them and say 'I just paid you in bitcoin' ;)
@_date: 2016-03-31 13:07:46
Used this in beta. Here's my short review:
- generating bitcoin address is a breeze. Comes in alphanumeric and QR code
- transferring money to another Bitcoin address was fast. 3 options available depending on speed. Can also transfer to email address, but have not tried this yet
- works great with the debit card. As soon as I use it to make purchase, the transaction showed up almost immediately in the app
- used it to verify PayPal. Code arrived super fast

according to the article US citizens can still get the virtual card and use it for online spending bruh
your legislators have pretty tight laws 
@_date: 2016-03-14 07:16:40
Chill, E-coin is just my preference as a customer. 
But either way let's agree that competition is good. More btc cards, less fees in the future hopefully
@_date: 2016-03-14 05:13:26
Shift is too American for me. Nothing personal but I want to use a global card, not a card targeted to US consumers
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:00:14
What's 'backdoor'?
@_date: 2016-03-14 05:02:35
Get a bitcoin debit card, and use your bitcoin anywhere, my friend. 
I personally use E-Coin. Others can chime in as well.

don't push it with this u/ - I tried to see his POV but it's too binary, you either use btc 100% or you are are a slave to the enemies. There's no middle ground. 
its hard to use btc in my country, there's literally less than 10 shops that accept it. I depend on this service. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:22:47
I know a lot (ish) about bitcoin. where's _my_ man to profess undying love for me? :(

Idk guys... After what happened to The DAO, I'd rather have kyc/aml implementation to find out cyber criminals faster. 
Edit: not a popular opinion, it seems. Am I the only one worried that digital currencies will be main financing source for terrorists in the future? I just want a safe world :(
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:08:14
There OP, reviews and comparison of all major cards - 
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:00:32
Don't be too quick to call it a scam. It's an oversight by a new company, trying to navigate itself without pre-existing rules and guidelines. It's not nice, but give them a break
@_date: 2016-06-28 09:22:26
Thanks dear. Edited my comment
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:07:35
Tip if you don't want monthly fee on Wirex accounts- only keep btc and exchange it to USD/EUR/GBP when you need it. If card account is 0, no monthly charge. it's a small amount, but small savings add up!  
Edit: words 
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:20:38
This is a Bitcoin debit card, basically a prepaid card that you can top up with bitcoins 
Not all are equal. I'm partial to e-coin (aka Wirex) because they are the best all-rounder. You can't get it delivered to US through.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:35:35
Found answer in a reddit thread and recovered, phew: 
Basically, intentionally put in your ledger pin wrongly 3 times. When resetting, select 'restore configuration' and put in your original wallet's 12/24 pass phrase. 
Leaving this up in case it helps anyone.
@_date: 2016-11-04 16:30:28
Yup that's correct. As for which is more convenient, it depends on what feature you want. No pre-loading via xapo will expose it to bitcoin volatility more but lets you keep btc until you need to spend it. pre-loading via Wirex lets you keep cash currency at the rate you decided when you convert the bitcoin, so calculating spending is easier to keep track of,but you will miss potential price increase. Although to be fair you can just convert the amount you need whenever you want with the app, so it's not such a big deal to me. 
I think with bitcoin cards, check the pos rate, if they deliver plastic cards to your country, atm fee, currencies they support, their apps, their security features in order to pick the best for you
@_date: 2016-11-02 09:58:43
I think it's really nearly impossible for credit card and you can't escape indirect fees from PayPal. I know that e-coin.io allows you to top up debit card (the first virtual one is free from them from the wirex app) with money from PayPal, then use that money to buy bitcoin. Takes a few days and only for some countries, but it's possible. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:59:17
Some countries you can wire transfer. They also allow altcoin deposit (converted to btc) via shapeshift
@_date: 2016-11-08 07:53:38
Here I can't share about Xapo because I don't use it, but I'm familiar with Wirex. If the card is stolen (with pre-loading funds), thieves cant use it without PIN. Also, you can  block the card from the app, so that's good for that piece of mind. 
Like all bitcoin service providers, I don't suggest you keep all your bitcoin on there. Bigger companies have been hacked / go bust. I keep a small amount in Wirex, and use the 2fa plus damn strong password to keep that account safe. All other bitcoin is in my Trezor wallet. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:07:57
Protip: convert your btc when it moons! It happens about once a month (kinda), so I preload my usd card once a month. Works well so far! 
@_date: 2016-12-03 03:17:57
This makes it the cheapest bitcoin card ever! 
@_date: 2016-11-04 04:25:36
I'm familiar with these services. I'll just share what I know. 
Xapo is for people who are attracted by its cold storage feature. In an age where reputable service providers get hacked, it's incredibly powerful to focus on this service.
Wirex is for people who wants a well-rounded user-friendly service (I say well rounded because it can accept altcoins via shapeshift, has quite nice mobile app, etc, lots of features). But its less useful for US users I hear, more for the international crowd.
the fees are similar, its up to your preference. if its more for storage, go with xapo. If more for day-to-day use, use wirex.

I signed up as well, and my Avast didn't do that

I'm sorry for your troubles, but this is hilarious to read lol

Get virtual bitcoin debit card like E-Coin, and use it like a normal card, just that the funds come from your btc
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:58:06
Geez, thanks! Am extremely flattered for this! 
@_date: 2016-05-13 10:12:09
This thread should have what you need
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:55:13
nice! I can't speak for all, but Malaysia only has a handful of places accepting bitcoin. But our localbitcoin is pretty liquid if you want to convert btc&gt;fiat. That or get a bitcoin debit card for your travels, most places accept visa/master
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:46:38
that's pretty steep :/

@_date: 2016-05-27 08:58:09
did you mistake the 3% for foreign transaction fee? I've been using it to pay for stuff in usd and my local currency. 3% fee for local currency, but none for usd
@_date: 2016-05-27 08:27:40
mostly as a convenient way to spend bitcoin

don't they have their own recommendation for things like this?
@_date: 2016-05-27 08:16:35
yess! I have the wirex card so the 0.25% is great news! thanks fot sharing!
@_date: 2016-05-27 08:07:43
I use it. you mean additional fee beyond what's shown on-screen when you convert bitcoin to usd? well there's the monthly fee of usd1, but other than that no other fees I think. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 11:31:07
I use E-Coin, and the Bitcoin wallet in there is attached (might not be accurate wording, idk the word for it) with bitgo, making transfers instant :/
@_date: 2016-05-31 16:31:11
I'm sure you guys get it a lot, but just wanna say your company name *rocks*
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:49:17
Yeah PH has a lot of OFW, I'm not surprised
And I heard you can buy bitcoin from 7/11 or something like that,is that right?
@_date: 2016-07-15 09:33:55
Nice! 
@_date: 2016-05-23 11:37:08

Lol he is a character isn't he
On a side note, I use wirex and it's pretty good. Ships to selected countries, about 130 of them iirc

Don't cry for me :)
