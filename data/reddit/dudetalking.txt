this sounds crazy, but he did have a point calling BS, on the difference between a brain wallet and reversing public key.
If there was  ever proof that a RNG key was reversed Bitcoin and all crypto would be dead.
I think the Dr went off on a tagent when all he had to say was can we discuss how you mined, where did you mine the bitcion, why did you do what you did.
Rather then pin him on the signed transaction, it would be interesting for an AMA from Dr. Nicolas T. Courtois, if he isnt bound by any NDAs

Bitcoin is data, you pay per kb to include your data in the block.  You have a lot of data at 20kb this is what determines "transaction" fees.
Its not actually a transfer fee its a write fee.  Your wallet had to consolidate a lot change inputs to dig up your $7.00 transfer, and as result your "fee" as a percentage was high.
Keep in mind Bitcoin doesn't care what you pay as a percentage of the money transferred, miners just care if you pay them to include your transaction and bitgo doesn't collect any fees here.
Don't worry Lighting will fix this soonish.

I don't think its possible, if you require external factors to regulate the supply, that will always be either an attack vector, or a source of interpretation. Let's say you use the employment rate or inflation, based on what measurements?
Also, stability is in the eye of the beholder.    I think the problem is the idea of a currency and an economy being intrinsically tied and then the issue of an economy being part of a nation-state.  ergo, Policies drive the state, drive the economy and the currency becomes a policy instrument.
The question is do you trust free markets to regulate the needs of the currency and in the end, you must accept that free markets are prone to bouts of irrationality, so instability or chaos is a normal construct.
I don't believe Bitcoin will ever reach a stability like a fiat currency, because the supply is fixed so the only way to adjust will always be price. 
One could make the argument that a perfect currency should have some inflation built in to handle loss at a minimum and factor in natural growth.  
So a currency with a 2-3% inflation rate would be ideal.  But even then, it won't change the fact that supply rate is still fixed.
This also why I believe Bitcoin will never work as a global payment insturment. It's like settling your grocery bill by selling your condo.

Living systems tend to move toward ordered states. So in fact centralization is the path of least resistance.
If everyone transacted on the blockchain, we could move to global flat tax, basic income, transparent governance, single id. Why not create a hash of genetic imprint at birth that is forever associated with you on the blockchain. Easy to track, required for employment, verification, and voting. Voting could be done on the blockchain and because everyone is tied by their unique genetic imprint no way to conduct fraud. 
Either scenario is likely, although humans prefer more order not less.

If you stash is of significant value to you I recommend Follow the rule of 3.
Move 30% to a third party with multi-sig like coinbase. You outsource the worry and still retain control of the coins.
Move 30% into Bitcoin QT and follow security precautions, I believe in sticking with the most developed and supported wallet.  Just think of all the wallet vendors that have dissappeared over the last 3 years.
Move 30% to a paper wallet and place in a safe deposit box or home safe.
Alternatively you could use a hardware wallet like trezor for one of the 30%
This will insure you from a catastrophic loss.

Here's may best stab at  it:
 in the video: 


That’s looking at it too small.  Unfortunately, not many people seem to have knowledge of assembly code or forth or anything like that anymore. I listened to one of Nic’s earlier talks and he was talking about limitations. In machine code there’s none of these limitations. In fact, we have rather rich instruction set in bitcoin, it’s just not well defined yet. Then the next part is we have the ethereum going out there saying we need to build a new stack because can’t loop.  But, no one seems to realize that Forth actually does loop, you have to use a separate control stack.  It’s not like a lot of code forms where you actually have a single stack.  Forth and forth-like languages use a dual stack architecture. So everything that we are talking about in derived contracts can actually be done directly in bitcoin and bitcoin protocol its um just gonna take some time for people to understand it.


I have never heard that opinion before. I have never heard anybody call Bicoin Script Turing complete. I don’t believe that’s accurate.


The Difference is the script itself isn’t. What you can do, you have In forth a control loop, so the looping function is a separate thing.


I think everyone continues to think too small, I mean the "homomorphic (*sound as if he prounced hemimorphic*) properties of ECC basically means we can exchange a cryptographic key a symmetric key and encrypt documents load those, store them as a function that we can relate to on the blockchain itself, but more than that we can actually link them into things like ipsec and we can build firewall policies that uh  transmit it because of purchasing a token by tokenizing all these things by tokenizing access we can than take our access via the block chain shared keys,  and because of the nature of ECC we can actually have your public key but my secret key equals the value under point multiplication, point addition of the opposite. So my public key while your secret key we can take  a hash of that use a deterministic function  and find a shared hash we can both recalculate, if we are talking then about access to websites, Digital rights management we have all that capability there.  The majority, um we are still thinking it’s just money there is much more.

If that was the case they would've banned gold.  Most government and central banks have moved to free market pricing mechanism and any time they try to prop up currencies they get steam rolled.  So it won't happen unless you get some U.N action on it and again that won't happen.
I think bitcoin will be another policy tool, central banks will eventually hold bitcoins like they hold gold.

Ok, this video actually makes me think this guy is a Con Man. Everything and the way he talks indicates somone who is trying to bulldoze you with too much information. Not at all what I gleaned from Satoshi's writings although its possible if this was  team that perphas craig wright coded, and Kleinman was the ghost writer.
But the first case he made saying that its a separate stack was somewhat confusing and I think Nick Szabos response was correct.  
Also, he then went on to reference tulip bulb mania, he drops that he has one of the largest super computers in the world.
But he's technical discussions where somewhat erratic.  Like he's dropping buzzwords, ECC, Hash of two keys.  
I don't know, nothing so far indicates this is Satoshi, but it maybe he is actually tangentially involved or may know more.

I am agonostic. There is no concept of perfect money or perfect monetary systems. These are abstractions.  Humans and societies will adopt the systems they need to function any tool is as good as the society itself. We see that in how bitcoin has been adopted by the darknet culture.
I think Bitcoin will be around it is a counterbalance to a purely fiat based system which has its pros and cons, and gold is a dead technology. So in fact most gold holding are promissory notes and not backed by physical gold.
Overtime Bitcoin will absorb the gold industry.
Also, Bitcoin fits a psychological  need, the idea of money for nothing, independence from government etc. Its innate in humans to passively resist authority. Bitcoin offers that and that is powerful. Its why I wouldn't be surprised that bitcoin grows huge and eventually it will stabilize and be contained and then be as boring as gold.  
But I also fear for a dystopian future were Roger Ver is the most powerful man in the universe if Bitcoin gets to big.

I don't know Satoshi so I wouldn't dare claim he seems arrogant vs Satoshi's humilty.
Additionally one discrepancy wouldn't mean much but when you have multiple items that conflict with things that Satoshi actually did, vs claim then you have things that place significant doubt.
He maybe Satoshi but so far there is nothing beyond "documents" that show him to be satoshi.
Where are whitepapers he may have publsihed, or any other dabblings in Game Theory, Economics, Programming, Mathematics, Cryptography, ie something that would show he had some technical ability to accomplish this or prior knowledge.

This is true.  I agree that in a fiat system, money is just a transfer medium, labor and assets are the value.  So your goal is either maximize labor productivity or acquire assets which generate income. Because sitting on money does nothing for you. In a bitcoin system, bitcoin is the value asset.  So if I have bitcoin why spend it. What i need to do is get more to further restrict supply or incentivize others to bid up the price. But there is no mechanism in a fixed currency economy to really increase the value of your fixed supply by consuming because of transaction costs and the feedback loop of the value of the currency increasing at the same rate the economy expands.
Everyone knows this, if Bitcoin economy grows to 20 billion, from now, then my holdings will be worth 5 times more, so I need to get more bitcoins.  In a fiat system it doesnt work like that. Supply grows to match demand, so in constant terms you Dollars will either by the same product or decline in value, so you need to get a hold of tools that will allow you to keep pace with the expanding economy.
The only economy that is exists in bitcoinland is bitcoins, producing bitcoins or selling bitcoins. Nothing else exists.  And everyone know that producing bitcoins is a money loser unless you have a scheme to offload the cost of production to someone else and you simply reap the reward.
Bitcoin supply is fixed so any increase in  real demand has to be met by an increase in real price.  So my incentive is to sit on my coins and do nothing and wait for the price to go up. Which is what the majority of Bicoiners do. Its also why mining is a losing game, miners are not producing any real ROI, via bitcoin reward, they are running a option system by borrowing at low rates, exploiting borrowing or crowd sourcing from the public to acquire capital at near zero cost to sell the public bitcoins.  The only reason mining is profitable is by offloading all the costs to the public in 3 ways.
1. Stealing from the public outright through fraud, by having the public finance the capital investment. KNC, Butterfly, etc.
2. Borrowing from VCs or Zero rate loans
3. Exploiting Power Grids. Mining has moved to china because there is no regulations and stealing electricity is  easy.
4. Or running a loss, because you will make money in the future from appreciation, but in that case you should;ve just acquired bitcoin.
I still believe bitcoin has a function as an independent store of value. But just like gold economies, these values are transient because its only needed in times of disruption to the productive economy. 
People think gold was pushed out by governments, but gold was pushed out because its a terrible technology in a modern financial system.
When the productive "real" economy is functioning you want to have assets and labor.
I get you man, still holding my bitcoins though.

The problem here is people think they are creating something new, when they are not. There is a sense of arrogance.
Creating system, to bet, wager, pool funds, generate returns. There is nothing new, its been going on for thousands of years.  And for thousands of years crooks have been defrauding people via these simple methods.
So creating a web based system to bet on PRE IPO companies is not some killer innovation. 
Also, this is shocking.


We created bots to trade against incoming orders. They were like my friends. I even named them! My favorite was the “Jesse Livermore” bot. Opportunistic to a fault.
The bots would run every day and place orders against each other so the market looked like it was exhibiting lots of price movement and volume. For added credibility, we randomly generated trading histories for each company going all the way back to last year. So we had historical price and volume in addition to streaming quotes for chart data.
So they created a fake exchange to lure people to place real money into it.  Where is this being a "leet haxor" or breaking the mold.
SEC did the right thing, they saw someone who fabricated an exchange and was luring people to invest money with no controls, no transperancy.  
$20,000 they got of light. Quite frankly. They may not think so but a deep investigation and with the information provided here makes this look not like an unlicensed exchange but a fraudulent one.

If we look at the major value drives of bitcoin today; (there are more but here is what is usually discussed)  
1. Store of Value. I hold one bitcoin, I will always hold 1 bitcoin.
2. Transfer medium (payment system).  I can transfer value to another party. 1 Bitcoin, or some agreed upon representation, i.e. dollars.
3. Information Store.  I can used the block chain to hold arbitrary information, which can encompass points 1 &amp; 2.  
4. Decentralization: All points above are acnchored by decentralization.  So its not really a value drive but an inherent aspect to the nature of bitcoin. If its not decentralized its not bitcoin.
Bitcoin needs to succeed as store of value. It is not a useful store of value and I don't mean about retaining its fiat conversion. I mean ease of use.   That ecosystem is still developing.  Easier Wallets, mutlisig exchanges, transparency and trust for hosted bitcoin stores.
Bitcoins strength will continue to be as an irrevocable store of value and that will only come with time.  The network is only 6 years old.
Everything else, bitcoin does worse.  It is not a great transfer medium, and will never be.  It is not a great store of information. Its great to store information forever assuming point 1 can be established.  But most information in the world is not critical and would be better served by centralized storage systems.
Everything Bitcoin is evolves from it being an immutable store of value.  
Can I  store and be confident, that 10 years from now I can retrieve my bitcoin?  I don't believe anyone can answer that.    How will I know, that will come with time.
As this trust level increases bitcoin will slowly displace other alternate stores of value.  
Payment System are enormous distraction, and waste of time. People think it adds value the network.  But tell me where in North America or Europe can you use gold bullion to purchase PCs, or Coffee, or Happy Meals?
Yet can anyone argue against how Gold has succeed at its original purpose.

I think Altcoins are not hat big a deal and in the case of Ripple and Ethereum have enough differentiation to not be altcoins but alt networks.  Serving different purposes and markets than Bitcoins core function.
I agree to simply create an alt to do faster confirmation or great block size is pointless, and a majority of altcoin deserver the labels of scam coins. But the Altcoin Boom and bust also serves a cleansing it removes the dream of alt-coins and whatif features and replaces it with a reality. It allowed a quick development and testing of hundreds or thousands of variations, vertcoin: ASIC resistance, Bitshares: DAC, zerocoin and monero: privacy and many of the ideas in the end are not that interesting, but at least they get tested in the real world.
Also you need pressure on Bitcoin, if there is no Altcoin team working on coming up with a Bitcoin killer then where is the pressure on the developers to improve Bitcoin.
In the end its a natural process in a free and evolving system.

I still believe merchant adoption, not part of bitcoins future.
Especially with the incremental block size limits.
Either bitcoin is a fixed supply valuable asset, or its just a transfer system.  
You cannot do both well and these are laws of economics.
Sure people may throw off minor satoshis here and there. 
Also I don't buy the idea that using Coinbase or other entities means bitcoin is centralized.
The opportunity to participate in a decentralized world is now where you can buy a bitcoin at $250.00
If you miss the boat, then you miss the boat. Again that is human nature and the laws of economics are merely representations of human interactions.
Either bitcoin will become  a core fundamental asset of the global financial system. Like owning Real Estate in New York or London. You can sell it but long term holders pass it down and leverage it. Because as they say, there is no more land being built.

Moving the bitcoins via monetary exchange is not possible you become a broker, and money transmitter no Manufacturer will dare touch. Also it creates a whole new process that manufacturer don't want to deal with, selling, preloading, refunds, etc.
However if you sell a device and it has this little chip that chips away and mines things, well now you have an ecosystem. If the device has its embedded hardware wallet sure you the owner can ping a few satoshis at it, but it would be personally on your device. Like if I placed a dollar bill into my macy's leather wallet.
And if the electrical cost is minor or a non factor on the device. The unit value on the transfer is internal to the ecosystem. It means a  bitcoin complete universe so all that matters is the token exchange for access or consumption.

These companies were customers of DeMorgan Information Security Systems, a company from which Mr Wright had resigned in 2003. He had previously given an undertaking to refrain from directly or indirectly approaching any customers of DeMorgan.  
Mr Wright was sentenced to 28 days in jail, suspended on the condition that he perform 250 hours of community service. In 2005 he appealed the decision, but the ruling was upheld. In 2006, he took his appeal to the High Court, but lost

The decentralized nature of the internet means that things never die. I suppose bitcoin would be a failure in the eyes of many if it never move beyond the current niche environment, its market cap remains or shrinks and the the investments dreams of hundreds maybe a thousand are dashed and they never will own their own Bitcoin Island.
But I think if Bitcoin enters retirement you can point to other historical fads that just never took hold because humans are fickle.
It doesn't matter how good something is or if you think it solves a problem, people as  whole will adopt things and then they won't.  It takes a lot of work to keep things in a perpetual state of use. In 2010 Coke spent almost 3 billion in advertising alone.
Even within the Internet you can see how quickly technologies come and go, and in the end they are the same, just look at instant messaging something that has been around since the first days of the internet. Whole fortunes, have been made  and lost, in the Instant messaging industry, the industry has a life cycle measured in months.   At the end of the day, IMing hasnt really changed much since the days of ICQ. Yet where is ICQ?
Cryptocurrencies only solve one problem, the ability to transfer unique value to someone directly with no intermediary via the internet.  Bitcoin solved it.  Everything else is  fluff.
Confirmation times, mining, proof of stake, wallet gui's, nodes.   for over five years bitcoin solution has not changed. If Bitcoin "dies", its because people didnt really care for that solution to begin with.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:58:05
That's not the case at all many instances of successful market solutions which command premiums.  
People assume handing over something to someone should be "free" but when you look at whats involved to make that single action occur all the surrounds it is not "free"
And so the final solution may deserve a premium over alternatives.
The market already has a plethora of currencies that offer alternatives to the "feature/Fault" stack of bitcoin yet they can't seem to gain any traction.  My thoughts are that Bitcoin is it for the solution of secure value transfer online.  The next stage is what systems can exploit this value transfer mechanism. Ethereum, LightingChains , Side Chains, so on.  
Successful paradigms have underlying solid foundation.  Where would the internet be with out HTML or SSL or TC/IP. There will be iterations but the fundamental stack is grounded.
Bitcoin via its network effect and history is a core stack.  You can transfer value back and forth and have confidence in the value transfer.  Everything else are tweaks that are not adding anything to the fundamental concept.  
Doesn't mean there won't be alternatives and they will grow as bitcoin grows.  But the gap between bitcoin and the "alts" grows larger everyday.

Bitcoins ATM should not exist in 10 years.   The whole point of Bitcoin is to never need an ATM.  This is a Bitcoin Automated Exchange.
You are converting currencies not withdrawing funds from your account.
If you think it will get easier to leak fiat into  Bitcoin you are wrong.
The Governments allowing unfettered access to Bitcoin is greater risk than Money Laundering, it would imply the uncontrolled devaluation of the U.S. Dollar and other global currencies

This argument is valid if the majority of the bitcoin economy is build on trusted third parties holding keys and they move forward with FRB.
If the economy is built on decentralization, than panics will be muted, since it would be more akin to a reallocation of capital. 
Panics in the fiat system are real problems because the system is built on third parties holding your funds, and allowing them to practice FRB, in additoinal the amount of debt in the system leaves no room for repayment.  
There will be liquidity issues in the early years as people need to float between fiat and bitcoins.
The problem I see right now, is we need exchanges and we need healthy exchanges, but having centralization of funds goes against bitcoins.

Let merchants decide there risk level. Most merchants don't even require signature for credit card transactions under 10.00, McDonalds, Subway.   This is a business issue not a block chain issue.

In which case if you are a merchant and want to run the risk of handing over coffee on zero conf, great do so.  Just like some merchants don't care for my signature, fulling waiving their right to contest a charge back.

He sounds like someone who was turned off by the direction bitcoin has taken with regards to its poltical bent, and I agree.
When you have people like Shrem, turning their problem into the government is after us, it makes it a little ridiculous to take bitcoin credible.  Or every bitcoin conference you have Jefferey Tucker, why? Since when did a technology conference need  a political convention.
I would sure as shit be pissed if an industry conference turned into a platform for the democratic or republican party.

I think Mt.Gox points out on of biggest obstacle bitcoin has to overcome, that decentralization aspect is partial.
Bitcoin is no different then current transaction systems if at the end of the day, you are dependent on central exchanges and trusted 3rd parties to hold you'r assets.  
And if you can't use central exchanges, as many advocate then bitcoin will never achieve meaningful penetration, since it will not have any liquidity.
This is a serious growth issue that the bitcoin network will need to overcome.

When you take money out of a real ATM, you are notifying the bank
that you have taken money from your account, at a specific time and location all permanent records.  You had to go through a thorough identification process with lots of forms, to open a bank account.
All this to withdraw funds from your own account. On top of that there are limits placed by your own bank on how much cash you can take out on a certain day.
A Bitcoin ATM has to comply with the exact same laws in the U.S. for bad or good and distill that process into a &lt;10 minute experience.
Unfortunately standalone BITCOIN ATMs in the U.S. will have a pretty limited market for this reason.
Now if the large Exchange deploy their own BTC Network, Think CoinBase or Kraken,  then you would bypass the whole anal probe, since at that point you would withdrawing from your BTC account at an exchange you are previously identified.
ATMs are for withdrawing funds from an account.  These are not ATMs but rather Standalone Exchanges.  and in the US you are a money transmitter.
If you want to buy Bitcoins anonymously, you really can't. unless you get someone who is willing to transact and then how are they getting their bitcoins in the first place. They are probably buying on Coinbase with a full ledger of evey bitcoin transaction, and a verified account identifying this person.  
The only way to obtain coins anonymously is to mine them.

societies have been going on and off the gold standard since the beginning of time. In additiona using fixed supplies, whether land, food, cattle to shape a society is nothing new.
The feudal society of the middle ages as a fixed supply economy.  The land holders held the currency, they employed the surfs in exchange for some small parcel.
These type of fixed supply societies eventually create serfdoms, since the progenitors always have the benefit of being first in the economy.  Birth order rewards success.  
It wasnt just the Governments who abandon fixed money supply, the population demands it as they see that a wealthy class continues to acrue wealth simply by hoarding the money supply.

New York recent history is of a state  that is opposed to individual liberty.

I am in your corner but honestly, it doesn't matter the beauty of bitcoin is a bifurcated world.
You will have HFT firms, who will pull the same shenanigans with regulatory capture and abuse their clients with implicit cover from the government, and you will have legitimate exchanges that trade on the block, and you will have P2P transactions.
Because regulation will capture the big parties, they cannot capture the "legitimate" market.
Today if I want to sell a block of shares in google I must go through a broker service, and my order will be handled via the listed exchange or perhaps a market maker.
with Bitcoin I can sell my bitcoins however the hell I want. Because the regulators cannot capture the individual.
So what will happen eventually bad exchanges will pushout the good actors and they will be left with their fradulent order books.
Unlike the real world, where the regulation lock down all parties and so you are forced to play in a rigged market, in the bitcoin world you are free to move as you please.

You are correct in that there was no return, or investors.
I guess I meant imply that they never had the balances they claimed, from early on.
It was "ponzi" like in that the increasing value of bitcoin, and new "investors" drew people into Mt.Gox and they funneled that money to themselves and pay withdraws as needed.
As Gox rose Fiat came in from investors, and Bitcoins came in from miners. But withdrawls were always delayed, and the wheels came off late last year. 
Which again is very ponzi like, once the deficit gets to big, the ponzi controls outflows.  Delaying them, mistakes, lost paperwork etc.
Each time a new excuse for why funds are not available.

No idea specificall in Notepads case.
But dealing with Bitcoins directly has a cost, storage management etc. also there is a tax accounting cost in the U.S. now transacting in bitcoins.
I am bitcoin user and holder but is more expensive and costly to manage bitcoins than to manage a credit card account or cash.
It has a leaning curve and complexity, plus ongoing management. If you outsource to a 3rd party you run those risks plus total loss.
Bitcoin as a currency is way behind and has niche uses where it excels traditional payment methods. But for the everyday business to claim that bitcoins is easier or cheaper is not justified.  
If you use bitpay yes they have it simplified but again it does not alleviate the tax implications of tracking and filing for bitcoin transactions.  So you save on the merchant fees, but now you have additional filing expenses.

Mixed thoughts on this, one its a 3rd party which creates a counter party risk in Bitcoin. I understand it maybe a needed buffer, large investors are not necessarily going open an account in coinbase, *edit* actually a wallet in blockchain if they want full control.
On the other hand this creates the risk for oversized speculation that could concentrate bitcoin investments among a few monster funds between second market, Pantera.
These funds could create more volatility rather than less.
If bitcoin is to succeed, the total valuation must increase significantly to minimize the impact of these funds.

Here's a question, did Gox Coins in a client account show up on the block chain?
Since there was no accounting how do you know the coins wherever there to begin with?
Could a batch of real coins had been lost in the early days when a volume of 400,000 may have meant 800,000 or even 8 million and they have carried forward this loss at that point running a ponzi scheme.
Or perhaps the loss is really in Fiat and not bitcoins, but they are claiming the loss in bitcoins, 
1. They can claim they are lost and "forever"  really stolen by MK.
2. They recduce exposure to fiat. I mean in the eyes of court, bitcoins are worth nothing.   It would be like claiming I lost a harddrive with work on it so they have a more manageable liquidation with a ton of fiat.
Seems to me more and more that the behavior of MK matches that of other schemer like Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford, who never believed they really screwed its like they have disconnect from reality.

The Dark Market is here and its bitcoin.
I think the big picture here, is that we have over regulated markets that have been captured by the Neo-Corporate State.
The potheads think this will mean more weed but on a larger scale I believe this means allowing people to transact and bypass the onerous regulations that are weighing down the entire world economy.
Doesn't matter if you are starting a business in Europe, America or South America, the entire system is built to reward rent seekers.
Out of control DRM, Copyright, Trade rules, a byzantine mess to tax codes and regulations. Where by default all businesses are in violation. The minute they hang up their Open for Business sign.   So the State and the Corporatists sit back and whenever a small operation makes legitimate inroads on something new or novel or provide a service people are desperate, They pounce and the business either joins in the rent seeking or is shut down.
Look at Tesla and trying to setup direct sales dealerships in states.
Look at trying to buy Bitcoins for Fiat.
You want privacy in your email correspondence. not allowed.
Look at coming up with a new character idea that is not infringing on the millions of claims by Disney Marvel.
Got a new idea, don't bother some Patent Troll has probably patented the obvious.  
Have an idea for a medical device that may improve lives, the regulatory approval will exceed your lifespan. 
How many times are you going to pay to consume the same damn media or software.  
Meanwhile the same corporate powers with their armies of lawyers and accountants exploit the very laws they use to shutdown smaller businesses. 
So yes Dark Markets will be messy, bad things will happen, but if the end result is a collapse of the current monopolies then it’s needed.  
The world is screaming for a way out. The politicians will not change, so Dark Markets are coming on an unprecedented level.
I don't know if this evolution will be good or bad for the world.  But it will be interesting to see how it rolls out.

Of course its small because there is no large event drawing adoption.
What advantage does bitcoin offer over traditional payment systems for the  "average person" ..NONE.  There is no reason my grandmother needs a bitcoin account to buy from amazon.  Bitcoin as a payment system benefits are to the merchant not to the consumer at about 80/20.
Now what benefit does bitcoin offer a store of value.  HUGE. My grandmother had to flee a communist country where her jewelry was removed by the customs officer before boarding the plan and she was only allowed a simple bag with no "value" 
Bitcoin allows people to move "value" ginormous amounts of value with no restraints. 
The next crisis will drive bitcoin adoption.  
No mass adoption for bitcoins will come from amazon accepting payments, or a super slick wallet.  it will come from the Price of Bitcoin going up versus the dollar or other fiat.  
That is what drives bitcoin now.  If bitcoin was still at 10.00 a coin this forum would be dead.

I think  Robocoin and the merchants would be better served presenting Bitcoins with a banking sign-up process, educating the users that they are opening at Bitcoin Account, as opposed to spitting out virtual coins like cash at your corner ATM.

I believe in time this will be washed away the same way, the dotcom bust was washed away. 
But this is a painful blow.
You had all the signs before hand that Mt. Gox was a bad actor but in a "decetralized" environment you have no one that is willing to move quickly to remove the wolf from the sheep.

I can see a future where an evolved bitcoin protocol forms the underlying basis for value transfer world wide.  Where bitcoin is the point of reference in a ocean of decentralized autonomous systems.
The year is 2074
You complete a task and one your bitcoin wallets increments by 50 satoshis, 15 minutes later you complete another task, and another 50 satoshis are deposited.  You decide that after 30 minutes of work, its lunch time.
You scroll through your collection of auto agents that are busy deploying and managing your wallets and finances and other everday tasks.  Your electrical bill is due every 10 minutes but you haven’t see it in 3 years. An agent carefully monitors and adjust your consumption. As you walk from room to room lights are turned on moments before you arrive and turned of just moments after you leave.  You forget that the lights are actually never on all the time.
Your venture agent, manages your contract with a retro-dubstep band in Shanghai. Their agent pays you a share of royalties to your address as agreed upon by the kickstarter funding contract. The bands music is available for stream from the ether. Your broker bot ticks offs you satoshis it receives from streamers, and those who chose to pay a premium for a private live performance stream.  
You’re in the mood for sushi, you send your google droid to pick up food down the street from the local sushi bar. The google droid orders your usual, a california roll, 5 pieces of tuna sashimi and a Pepsi Aire.  A ping of 5 satoshis is sent out with the order.
The 5 satoshis, trigger the chef bot at the sushi bar to kick into gear and begin preparing you lunch. The bot expertly prepares the roll and carefully places the pieces in cardboard bento box, and slides the box into vending window 5.  Once complete it communicates the order is ready to your en-route google droid.
As the google droid arrives to station 5, it inspects the status of the window, confirms the displayed price of 10 satoshis and transmits the coins to the order address, the window slides open and the droid places the bento box into its basket.  A quick status message is relayed to you, sushi inbound.
As you pop a piece of tuna in your mouth you get a ping on your screen. Your brother backpacking through Iran, is at a bazar just outside Tehran and as promised has found what he thinks is the perfect Persian rug for your living room. 
You maximize the video chat, and watch as your brother shows you the rug from multiple angles.  You decide to buy it, and transfer a deposit to the merchants address  with  the balance placed in escrow. The merchant tasks the shop droid to ship your carpet.  A fedex drone is dispatched to the shop and arrives within 15 minutes, a video link is sent to you so you can watch your pickup drone live. The Fedex drone loads the carpet and flys to the regional hub where your package will be loaded onto the next transport drone bound for Belize.
With that you get back to work. Your work agent presents you with a choice of 5 new tasks. The tasks were selected from your bid pool based on your preferences and recent work style.   This one seems like fun, a trusted client in Latvia needs your emergency assistance with the décor for tonight’s big event.  You login into Amazon AWS to locate the nearest presence drone, perfect there is one just 5 blocks away.  You pay for 1 hour of use, 20 satoshis.  As the drone travels to your client’s location you initiate a Hi-Vid session. A high resolution stereoscopic picture fills your eyesight and you are transported to the streets of Riga. Never gets old, moving at 60 kph while you are presence linked.  45 minutes later a revamped room is ready for the big event. Your work agent confirms receipt of 150 satoshis from escrow.    
Time to hit the beach.
Sorry for the typos and the mediocre writing, just thought I would have some fun this  :)

This is typical bad assumption made by many people. That market price indicates the net value of your holdings.
If you hold a small fraction of something in a highly liquid market with no Six Sigma events looming then you are correct but as you go up the holding pyramid this is an illusion.
What the unit quote for a single item is versus what the market will actually clear are worlds apart.
This especially happens in highly illiquid marktets with rampant mispricing, which is where bitcoin is today.
The fact is we have no idea for example how bitcoin would handle a highly deflationary dollar event ala 2008.  Can the winklevoss/and hedge funds sit on their holdings if their investors coming knocking because they need to redeem funds. They will  need to liquidate their bitcoins.  Would dormant accounts suddenly come alive fearing that a massive bubble was popping.
Would miners quickly liquidate holdings to pay for escalating electricity costs in their fiat denominated utility bills. Would mining power go offline, lowering the security of the network devaluing bitcoins further.
Would 1000s of bitcoin startups go dark, with no real fiat backing.
How quickly would the market crash. 
People need to eat, pay bills, and pay back investors.  Bitcoin is still in a very fragile state and people should be very careful the assumptions they make.

The reason regulation comes about is to establish rules, processes, and standards that the regulated participants need to abide by.  Proper regulation works to minimize bad actors and to provide stability. 
Is it perfect no, does it provide guaranteed outcomes no can the regulators abuse or be caputered by the industry yes.
We all know the results of 2008, but 2008 results are also partially to blame for the lifting of glass stegal. 
Regulation is not something that always springs from evil statsits it  comes from the people demanding action to prevent abuses of trusts or from an industry which wants to raise the barriers to entry and establish a mimimun level of perfomance to protect the industry.  
Imagine if there was no regulation of medicine and there were no basic requirements to being a doctor. How would the average person know who actually is a real doctor and who is just using google. Fraud will occur; but the regulations help push the bad actors to the outlier and raise the cost of fraud.
As someone in technology industry I am very anti-regulation particularly when it comes to technology.  
But relying on after the fact systems is bad when you are trying to grow an industy that is based on trust and where there is no reversibility of transactions. 
Bad actors will destroy bitcoin more than government regulations.   The government will never have full control of bitcoin becuse of its decentralized nature.
But there will never be mass adoption if every year some exchange blows up and steals bitcoins.  
What happens tomorrow to bitcoin if bitstamp goes down?
I think regulations targeted at exchanges  would be good for bitcoin.  At least in the US using coinbase they are 60% of the way there just by utilizing the banking system. 
Wants needed is more transparency about their financial positon and the practices they use to secure bitcoins.
The average person doesnt care about changing the world they just want to know if they buy  bitcoins they wont get ripped off.

Trust and Honesty should be first and foremost within the bitcoin community.
When you setup a foundation that is looking to get the world to place their earned labor into a new financial system, these should be the primary goals.
It's clear that the foundation's creation and process was adhoc. Not just the board members but even some of the member companies, and we know who, should not be permitted members.
It's not even clear who is in charge at the foundation.
There are many great actors within the community and I hope they exert the pressure on the foundation that the behavior by Shrem is unacceptable, and they need to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
We should not use the existing Financial system as a moral compass.

Yes, That is the issue, they are not ATM.
A more appropriate thing for this would be if Coinbase deploys a network of ATMs, or in the future they create exchange agreements with Banks or ATM networks.  Then you could withdraw or deposit Cash from to a verified coinbase account.
Until then, these are not ATMs, they in fact should tell, you to create your accounts, and complete verification ahead of time.

I think the foundation should be renamed the North American or US Bitcoin foundation.  Hard to belive it can really be "Foundation for all of bitcoin"
As an American I don't believe that  innovation in bitcoin will be here. To many regulatory obstacles for good and bad reasons.
I think the US can provide the financial stabilization bitcoin needs with stable regulated exchanges, which will allow a large influx of capital into bitcoin.
But once funding is in the system it will flow to the highly innovative markets.

So no coin tainting is terrible.  Bitcoin is gold, Are you making sure the gold earring you bought for your wife, isnt made from gold stolen from a jewler 50 years ago.  
This is the one thing they need to tie into the protocol to kill this idea of coin tainting.

Its going to happen.  History shows what happens when you have economies based on fixed units of supply.  There is never enough to go around.  so you need to debase the currency in order to meet demand.
Also, why I feel that bitcoin will have limited success in the crypto world as a currency, and its ultimate success be as a store of value. I believe its the Manhattan real estate of the digital world. 
If I could use bitcoins in escrow as a proof of reserve and borrow litecoins/ xcoins to conduct transactions it would make economic sense.

It's entirely possible and Peter was right to bring it up.  
The easier way to take bitcoin down is via exchanges.   As long as there is no easy to move fiat bitcoin will struggle, especially since bitcoin has built its own barrier to entry through the explosion of asic miners.
The only way for someone to get bitcoins today is to buy them as mining as out of reach for the average person.  
Pushing bitcoin to the fringes will negate mass adaption and it can be controlled at the periphery by the larger states.

Number one need in an functioning market is efficient price discovery. The best Price discovery happens on exchanges, without this Bitcoins are dead.
How would merchants minimize risk, how would new users into the markets purchase bitcoins, how would bitcoins stablize, how would bitcoins allow large entrants into the market.
Seriously every time I hear someone say park your bitcoins in cold storage, I mean whats the point then. 
This also, why the exchanges if they are serious players, need to have a game plan to not just reassure existing customers but reassure new entrants.  
Don't know if this post if FUD, probably is, but I would like see much more transparency right now.
No excuse for exchanges not to be open books.

I agree with the risk, I am not sure much will be done.
Here is the difference those games can be played because the derivative market for gold is necessary or for other commodities because of the difficulty in taking hold of the underlying, either because of physical or regulatory limits.  I can't park a oil tanker in the front of my house and most investors will not take delivery of gold. The  limitation forces the creation of these markets.   
Bitcoin market will be constrained, and because if its transparency and its lack of regulatory support will make it difficult to build the opaque markets we have today.
Any firm that attempts this will get their asses handed to them, because they can't fool the market.  Comex manipulation has been asserted for some time but again, still I've never bought into the long term manipulation, there are plenty of big whales who if they could would break someone, as Soros did on Sterling trade,  Or Burry did on CDS.
Eventually the markets find a way.  If you believe in market forces than bitcoin is a pure as it will get.

mt. gox largest exchange went bankrupt.
they claim to have lost, misplaced or had stolen 750,000 bitcoins
the OP is one of the more well know developers for Bitcoin Gregory Maxwell.
OP posted the address of a transaction block, which shows that someone is moving  coins in Mt.Gox from a batch of the possibly missing bitcoins. Coins which have not been moved in a very long time.
They are breaking the coins up to smaller transactions using an internal process know primarily to Mt.Gox.  Possible speculation is they maybe ready to disburse funds to Mt.Gox accounts, or because the bankruptcy court is requiring them or because they are getting ready to move the coins through a Mixer, which will hide their trails and allow them to erase their ownership of the coins

How can you double spend something small
I don't understand this fear of zero or 1 confirmation transactions.
Maybe I am in the wrong, but my understanding to execute a double spend attack you either need to do it as a race attack, which is rolling the dice, and for face to face transactions, really useless especially or you need a miner in colusion, or you need 51%, so really the chances of race attack are so small for brick and mortar transactions.

I am not seeing the connection, I wasn't aware that someone using Satoshis email signed a key and published it on the p2p foundation.
The fact that someone signed a key spoofing satoshis emails doesnt mean he has control over the email ie president
People can spoof dates, emails, etc, so thats not an indication that Satoshi doesn't have control. 
My suspicion is  he felt he needed to act, the fact he hasn't said anything in so long was proof enough.
It could be a hacker, but assuming it is, the behavior of the hacker is the same as if Satoshi had said it himself. Since the hacker is not exploiting his advantage of having Satoshis email. 
 Which circles back either Dorian is Satoshi or he isn't and if he is not Satoshi, then it is still likely that Satoshi did post. 
In other words regardless of how you look at the the overwhelming  odds and evidence is that Satoshi made the post.

You maybe right and I agree that Bitcoin ATMs maybe a novelty but that is the U.S. Laws.

I love Bitcoin. But there is no economic foundation on why Bitcoin will ever achieve stability. In fact Bitcoin will always suffer booms and busts.  Because the issue is not whether a currency is fixed or not it is human behavior.
Humans wage wars with or without money, the get caught up manias with or without money.  The make stupid decisions with or withou it. 
The last 20 years should be an indication of how much havoc people with limited means can cause.
Bitcoin being a worldwide currency would not erase that behavior, there have been all kinds of history of fixed supply currencies in economies, such as Land, Gold, etc.  Same issue humans still misbehaved and the fixed supplies would have booms and busts.
Bitcoin will not change human behavior.   So your dad speaks with the voice of experience.
In the end I believe that some small countires will adopt bitcoins as a currency the same way they use the U.S. Dollar as a currency peg.   
Imagine 9/11  in 50 years and the result is a physical loss of 2% of bitcoins because the Cold Storage backups where maintained it what was thought was a safe location.  At this point Bitcoin is used globally. What would happen to the price of bitcoin?  Do we need to convene some emergency fork to restore 2% hit to global money supply?

So the dollar will devalues to a point, which is what the FED has been attempting for the past 5 years via ZIRP to modest success.
That would be great for reducing our Debt Load as  nation.
But they can just as easily raise rates the flow and revalue over time.  
Bitcoin is fixed the dollar is not.
I will choose to transact in the currency most beneficial.  I still need to pay taxes in dollars, buy securities in dollars, hold dollars if the interest rate is sufficient, the majority of day to day services will transact in dollars, business will maintain dollars, I still want FDIC insurance, and consumer protection for transactions.
I dont see Bitcoin  replacing the U.S. dollar at large scales, even if it replaces total hard currency its a drop in the bucket and would be a net benefit for the United States in saving on currency production, and simplifying transaction tracking and auditing.   
The money supply of the world is between large nations and High net worth individuals and they keep all options on the table.  Who cares if a large segment of the general population goes  bitcoin they do not determine the resources of the world..sadly.  So they will not reall pose any significant threat to the stability of G20 nation.
On small nation level sure, maybe.
Bitcoin is a store of value until it becomes legal tender, not ever. it cannot replace a national currency, and if you think the general population will build a massive black market to collapse the government, that is not reality.    It hasnt even happend in Cyprus, let alone the U.S.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:45:44
Bitcoin only has value relative to fiat currency. 
It has no intrinsic value, since it is not Legal Tender in any nation.
So of course you can only judge it pegged against anything else.  
I don't think that's greed it just common sense.

I would love to see this "one that is a lot better". 
Bitcoin has 5 year lead pretty good developers, by leaps and bounds the largest community, has been obviously tested and continues to rebound.
Any "new" entrant would have to overcome this, and the thing about cryptocurrencies mass adoption will not come from slick branding, or easy wallets.  It will come from the damage these currencies will continue to inflict day after day, devaluation by devaluation on fiat.
When you see your price of &lt;INSERT DAILY NEED&gt; go up again and again in Fiat, and then you see that you get zero% keeping your fiat in a bank, that is charging you $50.00 in fees, meanwhile this currency you hear about keeps going up.
That is what will drive mass adoption.  
If Bitcoins fail, then crypto-currencies in general will fail and most likely because Governments and Financial Institutions will align to combat this at the edge by hammering the individual.   
The fight will be worth watching, but I have no expectations the masses will win, they never have.

It's possible that FRB exists throughout the BTC economy today, how do you know Bitstamp, coinbase or any other exchange are not using customer deposits for other things.

FRB could be limited if third parties hold each customer deposits directly on the blockchain as opposed to pooled. But that would be inefficient for an exchange for example and would not work.

Dishwasher froze, hard boot. Etc, when its not clear the benefit. I guess having your coffee maker reorder coffee over amazon.  Home Dashboard that shows you how often you do laundary, these are 1st world elite solutions and not killer apps.

I wouldn't say Gavin is being divisive on purpose, its seems he's really worried and he wants to deal with a problem before something breaks.
But the stress tests have shown bitcoin doesn't break. People just need to pay more and they should.  Bitcoin is not free and its the same illusion people complain about our modern finance system which is financed by inflation.
I understand the inflation is obviously temporary and a way to boot strap the network. But when you don't have inflation you have an expensive transaction model this is economics.
I will say that Peter Todd has been spot on from day one and the community has been ridiculous in going after him. Peter said this is completely a political debate not a technical one. And if fact all the technical arguments are not very strong.
I think a scaling block increase is fine, in that in the end there needs to be some scaling or fees will grow exponentially which also not good, but it needs to err on  the side of  security and decentralization.  Block inflation should handled like inflation 1-5%, when we bump up against the block, it means the network his high demand fees go up. But this is the price you pay to keep a network decentralized.
A 20 MB block increase is aking to inflation and the price could take a nose dive for several reasons. 
* You have reduced nodes, and increased centralization and decreased security
* Core Development is focused on bitcoin as a payment network. Bitcoin becomes viewed a transfer medium. THere are calculatoin floating around that show with about 20-100K bitcoins you could support billions in transactions, due to velocity of money.  Then the price is highly inflated. Also Bitcoin in this model is highly over secured and there probably needs to be further reduction in mining.
To me bitcoin is becoming more ripple like. 
The node problem is a huge problem and instead of doing something to address, the push is to implement something that will probably see node count drop like a rock.

The article implies that payment processors are necessary for bitcoin to work, when in fact its the complete opposite. 
In fact a a bitcoin world would see a highly fravmented processing industry that would survive by servicing niches.  Since if everyone was on the bitcoin standard I wouldnt need a coinbase in the first place.
Also its amazing how chippef these guys are at getting regulatory approval.  
I begining to see how a worldwide regulatory frame works were governments tell core developers on one end and then pressure merchant and financial systems on the other to deep bitcoin contained like a paypal lite.

The forum is useless for qualitative discussions about real issues affecting bitcoin. Your point is valid, and Coinbase has a valid point.
I think there needs to be some refinement of the BitLicense. But it also shows how the financial industry has always been slow not because they want to be but because they are regulated.  For good or for bad.  
The immense amount of scams that populate Bitcoin which fill the pages of this forum and bitcointalk on daily basis shows that regulation is inevitable, because bad actors are so exploitative they overwhelm the marketplace. There was a time you could publish your email address because no one exploited it, but sure enough greed got involved and you got spammers. Bitcoin is going through the same maturing process.
You cannot regulate Bitcoin, and I hope to never see an attempt but its perfectly reasonable to regulate businesses whose sole purposes is to take other peoples money and hold their bitcoins. They have a massive responsibility since its heads they win, and tails they win.   
The licenses needs refinement on that main point of features vs a new line of business. For example if Coinbase offers M-N multisig wallets does this need to be approved, or when they offered their coin vault feature.  But I can see if Coinbase gets approved as an exchange, and they materially change their business then their original application isn't valid anymore.

Bitcoin should not and cannot be regulated.
Fiat Bitcoin Exchanges should be treated just like a commodity or stock exchange and should be regulated.
Doen't matter if they are trading pokemon cards or bitcoins.
They should be audited, maintain appropriate reserve levels.
Or exchanges need to change their business models where they never actually hold the coines, if that is at all possible, maybe they are a p2p clearing house.
If the purpose of your business is to hold in trust other peoples assets then there is hundreds of years of case law and regulations that apply.  every industry that operates on that level of trust is regulated.
I don't believe there needs to be new Bitcoin regulation targeting virtual currencies, although it would be good to have the law or cases declares currencies valuable at their market price.

I don't think merchant adoption is needed for bitcoin to succeed. I have a different view of bitcoin as digital asset digital real estate, you store and build financial systems around not as a prunary payment system.. Bitcoin native is not a very good retail payment system because of its current nature.  
People are not going to stop using credit cards and IMHO trying to adopt bitcoin to a retail payment system requite further changes that weaken it's security and decentralization.

3. The loss of bitcoins is due, to commingling funds and probably early stage embezzlement when bitcoins where extremely cheap and downright incompetence at a technical level with management of the wallets.
4. Bitcoin prices rose faster than his ability to maintain funds inbound.

Do you understand traders are the foundation of liquid and stable markets. No traders, no market, no liquidity, your bitcoins have limited use. In addition 90% of the bitcoin distribution will occur via exchanges, since its the only way for the average person to enter the bitcoin market.  If you buy bitcoins on Coinbase your are buying on Bitstamp.
Do you think an Amazon would take bitcoins, if there is no liquid market to move the currency. They have 15-25  billion in sales in a quarter.

Gavin humbled you would take the time to respond to my post. I posed this question to Mike Hearn.
What is the long term soltuion. I think there would be more consensus if the solution was one that allowed automated scaling versus a one time implementation. 
Also I understand your point regarding coinbase, circle but those service succeed because of bitcoins complexity and I don't see how increasing the limit will change that. Eventually like people learned to live beyond AOL people will learn to hold their own bitcon but that is an adoption curve independent of this.   It seems there is a real fear that high fees will limit bitcoins use case, to some extent yes. But I think a model where people choose to hold bitcoin in longterm cold storage and use small amounts in a coinbae or ircle.to minimize fees for daily transactions is not a bad mix.
But high fees are simply a reflection of demand and value of what bitcoin provides. We cannot keep bitcoin in a perpetual state of free ride. In the end if no business model is provided to the miners what is their future?
Perhaps the way forward is a an approach that allows a more limited block scaling and allows fees to be the release valve during peak times. The way utilities handle power demand. It seems to.me the recent stress.tests.show that bitcoin doesn't crash but yes, low value transactions will sit.  The issue is perhaps providing a better mechanism for wallets to determine what the appropriate fees are based on desired confirmation times.
Yes bitcoin needs to scale but there also needs an understanding that transactions cost money and it's because bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized network on the planet.

1. Block size increase to any level is a patch, and does not fix serious inherent problems within Bitcoin that need to be address.
2. Block size increase can be a huge game changer without know what the long term consequences are, and it appears there is no real research. 
3. Bitcoin as it is architectured today will never be a retail payment system on a global scale.  We should focus on what Bitcoin is a 99.99999% secure trust less global ledger. Period.  And we should keep it that way.
The block increase to 20 mb will not get anywhere near being a retail payment system.  So what is needed is a sound foundation, the world can eventually build the solutions it needs upon.  It may still be we need to increase the block size, but this changes need to be better researched, than just using blogs to spam arguments.

This is a terrible attitude, in that Bitcoins entire concept of immutability will be at stake if hard forks are approaced as some kind of 3 year windows upgrade.
Bitcoin needs to reach a protocol stability and needs to sail off in the world.   Not try to adapt to every possible outcome.  Let it be the foundation that allows innovation on top.
Not saying a hard fork may not be needed, but Hard forks should be a once in a decade approach.  Thats the whole point of the argument.  Bitcoin is 6  years old its another hard fork.   If we take this approach then Hard Forks will schism bitcoin over time and its just as deadly as the so called "apocalyptic" block limit.

This also why its incorrect to say Bitcoin is free money.
Bitcoin is an asset that has carry costs like any other asset, whether its gold or real estate. 
Right now there is a lot of speculation on where bitcoin will be, I believe simplicity and ease will improve, but there is a real limit to where bitcoin can go because of the reality it is has physical restrictions.
How much security do you invest in $100 of BTC, vs 100K or vs 1,000,000.  I would say all the evidence points to a severe under pricing  of the carry cost of Bitcoin today, 
MT.GOX is one example, but so is Silk Road.etc Even so called pioneers who lost bitcoin on Mt.Gox clearly mis-priced what they allocated to securing their bitcoin investment.
I think for now, anyone with significant bitcoin holdings, needs to diversify their risk.
Hot Wallet, mobile phone, or PC
Cold Storage split amongs, paper wallet in a vault, coinbase, armory.

I feel like Gavin is not being clear about his views on bitcoin, he drops hints here and there but this is what get maybe I am wrong.
I have tremendous respect for Gavin and I believe he is trying to do the right thing for bitcoin. But in some  ways he is to passive about the dangers of centralization but because I feel that cynically  he sees bitcoin as being centralized already with respect to mining, regulatory capture of on ramps, and these are accepted.trade offs
 Gavin wants :
*faster confirmation times
* is not opposed to a permanent inflation model since he *doesn't believe fees will work, lifting 21 million cap.
wants block size increase
*has also stated he feels bitcoin is over secured 
To me Gavin believes bitcoin should  be a widely accepted payment system even if it becomes highly centralize 
I just csnt agree with this and the morr I heat people like Peter, Greg. Luke jr the more I feel that this approach is wrong.
Bit coin wil survive either way, but we make not like  the results.
I have serious concerns that this hard fork and block size increase will actual  affect the price negatively. Since. It's highly  inflationary, sets a precedent for hard forks and weakens bitcoins security.

*edit* I agree with your comment but would take it further. There was an article in the NY Times where Wences Caseres presented bitcoin in 2013 to big money at the Idaho Summit.  Coincidentally the start of the huge run up in Bitcoin.  Tim Draper  was pouring money in. Winkelvii have been in for a long time, Chamath Palihapitiya, also, we are in 2-3 years in from when the Big Money found out about it, and they made their killing in the run up to 1200.
Right now, the early money that is left is in and sitting. Whats left to invest in Bitcoin the currency, the Grandmas and Grandpas of the world. Just like the Internet Bubble, Silicon Valley and early money was in the 90's by the time Grandma and Grandap got in 98-99 then it was over.
Now, if you take a 20 year view you are early investor because of time.  But I believe those that think that Bitcoin will explode any day now are mistaken.  I would be surprised if a Bitcoin is over $500 in the next year.  We are the post bubble adoption phase just like the internet, where infrastructure will take years to build out, and it will be years before Bitcoin resumes a normal growth curve.

Maybe I am mixing various threads.
Read a lot the last few months.
Not spreading FUD. I think it's a viable.discussion since it's the way we pay miners now and I believe if your goal as a payment system and currency there needs to be some inflation, I think it was a mistake not to leave in a modest inflation reward of 1.5-2.5%  
However I believe in Bitcoin as digital gold or real estate. Not an asset to be thrown back and forth but a standard That will underpin future financial systems with a level of transperarency that has never existed before.  Want to know if your Government is solvent check the block chain.  This model IMHO is what we have to day. This is why I feel that raising the block limit should err on he low side favoring security and decentralization and should be a permanent solution.  Not something to worry about 5 or 10 years from now.

I can believe the adoption rate is extremely low, which either means that bitcoin can surge, or after 5 years bitcoins adoption is still pretty weak and may remain one of those geek things, like pgp.

I have sent bitcoins to family members via coinbase only to have them say sure I will set it up and they never get around to it, and the coins come back.

To the extent that Bitcoin is purely a commodity store of value akin to Gold, then it is purely a zero sum game, and in order for anyone to make money in Bitcoin as holder, it has to go up, because someone is selling another asset to buy bitcoins at higher prices.  Like all commodities you get Highs and Lows. Buying Gold in the 70's and 80's was a disaster, Buying Gold in 2000 has been a great move.
Now to the extent Bitcoin introduces an entirely new financial model and unlocks new ways to build businesses, to transact, to onboard people who previously had no access to 1st world finances, then Bitcoin is building a whole new financial world that previously did not exist.  Especially when you get into the more high end whitepaper stuff that is still a 5-10 years away from being mainstream, Decentralized Corporations, Internet of things self payment, Lightning networks,  etc. 
Its in the disinter-mediation that creates the great value unlock.
Think, Automobile, created whole industries that could not exist before, suburbs, garages, trucking, highway builders, chrome spinners, etc..

what is the solution to having permanent hard forks.  It seems to me if Bitcoin crashes when the limit is reached, then Bitcoin as it is coded is not viable in the long run, and there needs to be a permanent inflation of the block size, or it will "crash" I think the likely hood of getting past 20MB is pretty unlikely, if it has to be done as hard fork.  Assuming you even get 20MB now.

If you open a Bank Account and transfer money to a person or company on a Criminal watch list. They will notify law enforcement. Its a requirement of the Bank Secrecy Act.

Once you take Cash from a bank, you have removed the reporting requirement for the Bank. Unless the manner in which you take cash is suspicious.  
Coinbase is practically a Bank and they doing the right thing and protecting their business. Coinbase is not in business to help you break the law, or for them to risk committing violations of federal law    Read their terms and conditions. If you don't want Coinbase to do this, you need to move your bitcoins to another wallet.

1. If you want to discuss changes to bitcoin great do it, within the discussion of core.  No support too bad.
But the tactics that people keep using is ridiculous.
1. Propose massive change to bitcoin. 
2 Fail to get any unanimous acceptance
3. Launch Alternate Bitcoin Version, spam and complain how your super duper bitcoin version is the future. 
4. Still fail get any acceptance whatsoever.
5. Complain that your failure to convince people of your bad idea is the fault of "censorship"
Where does it end?  
Already SegWit is going to give bitcoin the increase people have been asking for and its still not enough.
It's ridiculous. 
I propose a Weekly Bitcoin Blocksize Megathread discuss all the same arguments that have been discussed ad nauseaum for the past 5 years. 
But stop generating block size threads every 5 minutes.
Also, the amount of time that has consumed the Bitcoin community on this  debate is what is setting the community back. CEO's ,Developers,  academics etc. wasting hours regurgitating the same thing.   
you proposed a sensible hardfork in BIP 102 if it is needed. I think you probably are close to 65%. But that is not unanimity. So lets keep BIP 102 in the back pocket, its probably coming.
Why do we need now discuss an alternate Bitcoin implementation?  What is there to do discuss. Why would we abandon Bitcoin core, just to chase a boost block size, when that is not what is holding bitcoin back.
Had SegWit not come forward, I would say next step is probably BIP102. But lets let SegWit come up.
Let the developers code. So far the Bitcoin Core dev team has only done what is in the best interest of bitcoin, they have sheppared and scaled the network.

Ok my comment stems, that Mt.Gox was not a teething issue,
It caused a liquidity issue in the market, caused serious lack of confidence in bitcoins, and resulted and decent capital loss to the bitcoin community.  One need only watch the non-existen trading volume of the last few weeks.
Bitcoin has a long way to develop serious enterpise level infrastructure managing bitcoins, and that there is still a serious centralization issue at the exchange level.  For the foreseeable future exchanges are on the on ramp for the rest of the world to bitcoins, and they will hold significant assets. Again, this was directed at the statement that "exchanges are for traders" as if they are some limited aspect of the overall bitcoin economy, when in fact exchanges are the Bitcoin economy
bitcoin-qt is not an enterprise solution.
Agree with you that the exchange market is maturing but has a ways to go.  Coinbase is mature but its still tiny and still significant risks, also coinbase is not an exchange, bitstamp is.
I think this dovetails toward the unfortunate need to have some stable regulated exchanges in the U.S. that will facilitate the next wave of growth.

Larger blocks equals more centralization, not less.  
And to say that larger blocks brings wider adoption makes no sense.  Especially when we have never allowed the fee market to establish itself. We have no idea what market based fees are.  Right now. it cost $8-10 to do a transaction in bitcoin, its not free. We pay for it via inflation.
I feel the block size is going to go up, but there needs to be a real recognition, that it is an extremely dangerous precedent and we should tread lightly  Because it goes at the heart of bitcoin.
A move to 5MB is enough to figure things out over the next 2-3 years.  20MB is crazy and it will send a signal to fill the blockchain with crap.  We have no idea what the unintended consequences of a 20MB cap are.
What is bitcoins primary goal?  Perhaps we need a Core-dev manifesto that finalizes what the ultimate goal for bitcoin is.
Is Bitcoins goal Mass adaption, even if it means more centralization.  Or is Bitcoins goal High De-centralization even if it means limited adoption.
I believe that a secure immutable highly decentralized ledger, will have global value as a final arbiter. Its not meant for you to pay coffee, heck it may not be meant for you to pay for Amazon TVs. It may be meant to keep governments, and financial entities honest, to facilitate global transactions.   
To me that is the real value of bitcoin. 
You cannot have both, also if fees never go up then forget about the 21 million limit, it means bitcoin needs to be a in permanent state of inflation and so it will become just  a token system that is quasi decentralized.
In the end Bitcoin will never carry direct transactions at a global scale its just not made for that.  
I think the real question is what changes can we make with the goal of keeping bitcoin decentralized and honest.
Do no harm.

@_date: 2015-08-20 15:59:31


  If the users are using bitcoin as token and not holding, or if they are using bitcoin as long term store. Those are very different use cases and will effect the economic model.
You are missing an enormous component in that simplified model. Velocity of money.   Come back with real economic model


Sure it can bitcoin is more centralized today in some aspects more users using it. Email followed the same pattern.  In fact decentralized systems have to continually combat the forces of centralization because the laws of economics and physics demand that systems that scale and seek efficiency must by their nature centralize redundant functions.  Why do we have so many nodes, maybe we only 1000. maybe only 500, maybe only 50. Oops 50 is to little they were co-opted by regulatory powers. 
The minute you start allow some centralization its hard to walk it back. Users are not a real-time voting mechanism on centralization effects and in fact they overall the don't care. The idea that decentralization appeals to all humanity is a fallacy, where is the mass exodus from facebook, or Windows OS, People should be seeking escape and they dont because centralaztion is efficient and 99% of the time people don't care. And quite frankly if Bitcoin acheives adoption by Walmart and Amazon, but its because we now have transaction filtering and check box from DOJ. So what, what did we accomplish in the end.


What are you talking about you think this is the end of hard forks, its just the beginning. If XT succeeds you get more not less.


Mike Hearn was interested in red lists, there is plenty of code in XT that establishes filtering, and again once centralization concerns take a back seat to growths its slippery slope 3 years, 5 years down we get the code changes that enable red lists and at the point is a smaller pool of easily to regulate participants who are forced to adopt the code.

This is how I always envisioned bitcoin.  If it was supposed to be a payment network for anything, why put a hard cap and not have any inflation.
The perfect example is Lazlo's pizza.  Under bitcoin everyone will always have a Lazlo pizza, because you are spending a precious limited resource on something. 
Eventually if bitcoin catches on people will stop doing that, and you see it today with Transaction volumes flat.  Anyone who really holds bitcoins at this point knows that this it, so either bitcoin succeeds or it fails. But to go and spend 1 Bitcoin today on lets say an Xbox console is insane unless I rebuy the bitcoin right away, and then what have I accomplished. That Xbox console could potentially cost me 1,5, even 10 thousand dollars a few years from know.
I want to avoid this converstion in 2025, 


" Oh Sorry son, I spent 2 bitcoin in 2015 when I bought you your Xbox console on the Microsoft store. I was supporting the network"

So Satoshi refused the change and preferred to kick the can down the road, and felt that when he needed it would be done.
Here is where I feel Gavin has mad a major mistake as the "Chief Scientist"  he should of played an apolitical role and shelved his personal view of bitcoin in an effort to work on consensus.  If consensus ends up being 2MB that that is what it is.  Instead Gavin has decided to go for the big move because he feels that its only interesting if Bitcoin is a global payment network. Something that even raising the block limit to 10 MB will not make it. 
Even Satoshi played it very conservative at a time where lifting the block limit could have been done with no issue at all. Kudos to Jeff who is always trying to fix things

I am curious, whats the possibility of OG Bitcoin that runs separately from XT, and rejects XT coins.  
My understanding and stepping out my comfort here so feel free to smack me down is, XT will accept bitcoin core transactions, but large block Transactions will not be accepted by Core.
So whats the incentive for me to switch to XT and not keep mining core, if I believe that core coins could be more valuable in a possible future, where 
1. A high possiblity of a massive Technical bug maybe discovered in XT
2. There is a likely hood of premature fork triggered and XT does not have the hashing power.
3. I feel that XT direction will weaken the price of bitcoin
I understand that XT hashing power could attack core, and vice versa.
Also, whats to prevent exchanges from hosting both, and let miners fight back and forth over where to commit their hash power?
What is the possibility of large whales coordinate with malicious pools to execute double spend attacks on the new fork feeling it may fail or its premature?
Is the key matter what version of Bitcoin Exchanges adopt and where miners go? Arent Merchants IMHO  irrelevant since their actual economic value is little, and in the end they will accept whatever payment method as long as they get their USD.

I won't dare speak for Garzik, but  my interpretation if you read the whole thread is how people a) obsess over PGP WoT as if it proves anything in the end in these instances,  if he did sign the message it doesn't prove its the real satoshi, unless someone actually knows who the real satoshi is, and observed when him sign something with these keys, and can been certain he hasn't been compromised or coerced, and then this "trusted" person can step in front of the community and verify that it was the real "satoshi", and the the community needs to be certain party B hasn't been compromised since again there is still no direct connection to who is behind the key and their mindset.  So it doesn't simplify the validation when it comes to these types of discussions.
b) PGP WoT in these cases detracts from the message, the content, the brain since again even if you accept in these instances PGP WoT its means little if the content has no value. So in the end you are back to the same dilemma what matters the content or the personality and which is real?
What if Satoshi posted signed with his Key (which no one even knows which is his key), "Buttcoin sucks, I've moved on to Litecoin"  
What does that mean?
OR the real Satoshi, never signs but posts an eloquent summary of Bitcoins current issues, and a nudge in the best direction.

Mises Theory missed the boat on the last 8 years and his predictions were wrong for the past 100 years.  If you followed Mises for economic planning you would've made a lot of mistakes like buying gold, and thinking that inflation was going to explode when its been the opposite.
Mises theories feels good because they feed our common senses and reinforce a sort of moral behavior and just view of how economics should work.  Mises and the Austrians resurged with Ron Paul, and the Great Melt down of 08.  
Unfortunately in practice it has been wrong.

Show me the economic model that shows more users = bitcoins go up in price? 
Total fallacy. Bitcoin has never been more used and more popular and the price is down and dont tell its me down because of the bubble.  
Bitcoin is a tradable asset competing with other tradeable assets.  If its viewed as psuedo-decentralized payment token with high turnover, then it has little value even if there are 21 million.  I will simply use bitcoin when I need to execute payments. And quite frankly I won't since there are million other ways far easier, with less friction to execute payments.
But why store any modicum of wealth in a centralized wallet, with contentious hard forks every few years, with redlists that filter my transactions and will effect fungibility.

ITT you get to argue against the position you took in the other threads.
Changing the coin limit could happen it may happen for the same reasons you need to change the blocksize limit.  To increase the acceptance of bitcoin. 
In both cases there are economic winners and losers.
The irony is that raising the blocksize limit may increase the bitcoin user base at the cost of making it more centralized (even if only slightly)
While an inflationary mechanism to bitcoin even if  just to keep up with coin loss would probably make it more acceptable and usable as  a currency with no impact on centralization, in fact it would make bitcoin more egalitarian.
Bitcoin is rule by majority.

thats not true people have presented code. What the point of coding, 2MB if the trolls shout it down as not big enough and fast enough. Even though there are very sound reasons for modest increases, especially when we can't even fill up 1MB blocks and many miners could barely process them until recently. The whole block debate has been a tail waggin the dog. Arising from desperation to repump the price.  
IMHO just let it go, worse case scenario Bitcoin is irreparably damaged and fails and its best to find out now at 3 billion which is a drop in the bucket. Best Case scenario we have empty 8MB blocks, Chinese Freeway to the non existent demand.

Bitcoin primary value was decentralization of a scare resource and high resiliency to censorship.
Bitcoin XT and Mike Hearns vision is not my personal vision (which matters only to me) for where I would like to see bitcoin.
Its ironic that people complained that a small minority of devs were running bitcoin (not the case) and now people are ready to switch to an implementation that is really supported by 2 devs.  
So in my eyes, Bitcoin XT is a new coin in a new direction.
It also smacks of desperation, Bitcoin has not gained any real transaction volume, its spam. There is no massive uptake of users or people using it for real services.  
The idea that we need to raise the block limit with no evidence of any needs seems to me that certain parties are not providing the whole story of where they see bitcoin, and why the see this sudden need in the last 12 months for massive block increases.
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:24:24
Visa is a payment system and could operate just fine running Bitcoin transactions for merchants just like Bitpay does. 
In fact VISA could offer Bitcoin services tomorrow worldwide through network and it would negate the concerns raising the block limit. Yes most users would not touch underlying bitcoin but if they wanted to hold some bitcoin they could purchase it anywhere still completely decentralized and be on the same level as VISA.  
The inverse is not true. We could raise the block limit to 100GB enable transaction processing for the entire globe on the bitcoin network. But only VISA GOOGLE and Microsoft decide to run the mining and nodes and data centers to process 100GB blocks.  So even if you hold bitcoins you are on centralized network effectively run by them, Sure you could fork your own Bitcoin call it freedom coin.  But the rest of the world will be happy go lucky to run the 100GB Bitcoin block.

What do you think banks, brokers spend on compliance? 
I still don't get the whining this only applies to bitcoin businesses whose only business model is to be a middleman and hold bitcoins for others. Zero impact on a person in NY using bitcoins for personal use


Does a consumer need a BitLicense in order to purchase goods or services with virtual currency?
No. A consumer does not need a BitLicense in order to purchase goods or services with virtual currency.
Does a merchant need a BitLicense in order to accept virtual currency as payment for goods or services?
No. A merchant does not need a BitLicense in order to accept virtual currency as payment for goods or services.
Do I need a BitLicense simply to develop software?
No. The development of software in and of itself does not require a BitLicense.
I guess it shows how little bitcoin has grown since we still have the same tired business models after 6 years.
So much for decentralization all the companies that complain can only do one thing. Charge you for moving coins in a "decentralized" network and act like pseudo banks but not want to deal with any compliance or liabilities.
Hey sorry I lost you millions in bitcoin because I spent money on my Maserati with the bitcoin license plate instead of securing my business, I am just a go go entrepreneur trying to break down barriers and free people.
Oh noes I have to hire a lawyer to run my business. I need to fill out paperwork. What you want me to show how I store things, and how I secure them.  this is horrible I can't build the next gen with this people breathing down my neck.
What a bunch of bullshit.  You guys who complain about bitlicense don't realize that you are funding the same models you complain about and then they do it poorly or you have no idea since there is ZERO transparency despite all this block-chain shows everything.  Where are the regular audits, where are the proof or reserves. Despite Mt.Gox bitcoiners continue to operate in the same manner.
So this is the bitcoin world in 2015

Not referencing your specific numbers but Either extreme would be a failure.   My stance has always been block size should go up, but it needs err on the side of the caution, since there is no way Bitcoin can scale to VISA numbers anyways anytime soon. 
Also, there is no large wave of adoption waiting to use bitcoin if we just increase the block limit.  
The "value" of the system is irrelevant. Bitcoin has proven its value.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:27:59
Without trying to start another blocksize debate. 


I think there is almost no one maybe 1 dev that I can think of that would categorically oppose a block increase of any kind.  


Codebase has changed a lot since Satoshi left, so again no serious dev believes in any divinity and no code is divine, maybe the hard cap. Everything else has been discussed.

As per Mike Hearn if nodes should only be run in Data Centers, and blocks are so large that you need these specialized nodes, than you have Bitcoin where Mining is centralized along with the nodes.  In effect a bitcoin that risks being controlled by Governments, or special interests.  
The cost of running bitcoin node is already creeping up. 
What happens if only fortune 500 companies can afford to run bitcoin nodes, or government agencies. How easy will it be then to target the handful of operators in the world.  And if thats the case could you imagine having a fortune 500 run a node to broadcast anonymous transactions where its not also certain that these transactions are breaking laws in its jurisdiction. Good luck
This is an extreme scenario, but with XT proposing to raise the block limit every 2 years, it becomes a possibility.
The only thing that makes bitcoin decentralized is that you can verify your transaction if you can't do that or you need to rely on a specialized Node at Amanz, Google or Azure than its really no different then Venmo, Paypal at that point with more overhead.
Whats the likelihood that governments wont at that point come and exert real pressure on how bitcoin is managed now that the technology is centralized just like email today.
Add to that fact that Mike Hearn proposed and implemented redlisting.   
Bitcoin has been around 6 years, all of sudden the sky is falling and we need to raise the limit. 
My suspicion is that outside interests both adverse to bitcoin and in favor of bitcoin want to move it in a direction where it will beneficial to them have more centralization and control.
Add what dev in India is going to work on Bitcoin if he cant even load a node.  Development will also centralize.

I support this move, and your argument is clear. 
The example you propose is also clear, we could have 10 discussions a day on Hard forks proposals such as BitcoinUnlimited, lets have a hard fork where the cap is lifted there has been plenty of discussion that a hard cap was a mistake and some inflation would be good in bitcoin.  But you are correct discussing lifting the hardcap is one thing, having troll brigrades pushing to download and new client which forks bitcoin to unlimited cap would not.
In addition the whole method that the Fork was posted in Bitcoin as if Bitcoin was forked already was incredibly arrogant.   
At some point there needs to be some adult discussions.

I think this Post from Eric Lombrozo merits including here.


Many of us have wanted to push our own hard-forking changes to the protocol…and have been frustrated because of the inability to do so.
This inability is not due to any malice on anyone’s part…it is a feature of Satoshi’s protocol. For better or worse, it is *very hard* to change the rules…and this is exactly what imbues Bitcoin with one of its most powerful attributes: very well-defined settlement guarantees that cannot be suddenly altered nor reversed by anyone.
We’ve managed to have a few soft forks in the past…and for the most part these changes have been pretty uncontroversial…or at least, they have not had nearly the level of political divisiveness that this block size issue is having. And even then, we’ve encountered a number of problems with these deployments that have at times required goodwill cooperation between developers and mining pool operators to fix.
Again, we have NEVER attempted anything even remotely like what’s being proposed - we’ve never done any sort of hard fork before like this. If even fairly uncontroversial soft forks have caused problems, can you imagine the kinds of potential problems that a hard fork over some highly polarizing issue might raise? Do you really think people are going to want to cooperate?!?
I can understand that some people would like bigger blocks. Other people might want feature X, others feature Y…and we can argue the merits of this or that to death…but the fact remains that we have NEVER attempted any hard forking change…not even with a simple, totally uncontroversial no-brainer improvement that would not risk any sort of ill-will that could hamper remedies were it not to go as smoothly as we like. *THIS* is the fundamental problem - the whole bigger block thing is a minor issue by comparison…it could be any controversial change, really.
Would you want to send your test pilots on their first flight…the first time an aircraft is ever flown…directly into combat without having tested the plane? This is what attempting a hard fork mechanism that’s NEVER been done before in such a politically divisive environment basically amounts to…but it’s even worse. We’re basically risking the entire air force (not just one plane) over an argument regarding how many seats a plane should have that we’ve never flown before.
We’re talking billlions of dollars’ worth of other people’s money that is on the line here. Don’t we owe it to them to at least test out the system on a far less controversial, far less divisive change first to make sure we can even deploy it without things breaking? I don’t even care about the merits regarding bigger blocks vs. smaller blocks at this point, to be quite honest - that’s such a petty thing compared to what I’m talking about here. If we attempt a novel hard-forking mechanism that’s NEVER been attempted before (and which as many have pointed out is potentially fraught with serious problems) on such a politically divisive, polarizing issue, the result is each side will refuse to cooperate with the other out of spite…and can easily lead to a war, tanking the value of everyone’s assets on both chains. All so we can process 8 times the number of transactions we currently do? Even if it were 100 times, we wouldn’t even come close to touching big payment processors like Visa. It’s hard to imagine a protocol improvement that’s worth the risk.
I urge you to at least try to see the bigger picture here…and to understand that nobody is trying to stop anyone from doing anything out of some desire for maintaining control - NONE of us are able to deploy hard forks right now without facing these problems. And different people obviously have different priorities and preferences as to which of these changes would be best to do first. This whole XT thing is essentially giving *one* proposal special treatment above those that others have proposed. Many of us have only held back from doing this out of our belief that goodwill amongst network participants is more important than trying to push some pet feature some of us want.
Please stop this negativity - we ALL want the best for Bitcoin and are doing our best, given what we understand and know, to do what’s right.

Interesting the concept of "small devices", what role would the impact of larger blocks be on IoT type of business model like 21.  Is their miner on a toaster model affected by this?
I still support the view of tread carefully with regards to the block increase but to argue that the limit is required for small devices doesnt make sense. I thought the issue was bandwidth not "small devices"
I do believe that bitcoin only works if its decentralized and the block limit increase need to be weighed against the effect it has on decentralization.

Email as someone mentioned had been around since the 1960's by the time you saw it in the 90's
By the time one technology reaches mass adoption there is a whole infrastructure that needed to be built out.
For email to reach mass adoption in the 1990's think of all the components that had to be in place, personal computers, DSL or Dial Up service providers, educated populace.
Bitcoin really is just one piece of the infrastructure pie.  
Additionally the reasons to use bitcoin don't really exist yet. Just as the need to use email in the 1970's did not exist.  Real time communication, 24 hour work days, etc.  
By the time email reached consumers it had been very entrenched in academia and major corporations for over a decade.
Bitcoin offers little to the average person today. It's main users are fringe people who are shutout from traditional payment systems. 
Even with merchant adoption. Electronic payments exisit, real time payment exists, cross border transfers exist, low cost money transfers exist.  
Bitcoins mass adoption may occur probably 5-10 years from now when another level of infrastructure exists that we are just beginning to imagine or it may never happen.  
There is also valid cases for why bitcoin may remain a niche platform, It may just float around serving people who are locked out but never really gain global adoption

That's operation choke point. I am pretty sure the DOJ called visa and said hey don't do business with backpage or if you do we may have to audit your transactions in detail.

If you are running a Bitcoin company giving advice on how to avoid capital controls, "terrible and immoral that they maybe" is not a smart thing to do.
Also, if your concern is evasion of these controls, never deposit bitcoins with anyone, since the authorities will target these companies, first just like the Chinese did.
Xapo and other "Coinabase like" companies all practice KYC/AML. So if your ideas is to move your savings into bitcoins through these companies and move the money offshore, good luck as the authorities will eventually see your flow of funds and if worth the effort will come after you.

Bitcoin would only work as a form of reserve currency to bootstrap a new drachma. Collateral pledge. They could also use gold or Power Plants and tax receipts.  The amount of cash in the society is an illusion its also why simply saying they can use bitcoin is wrong.  There is not enough cash and if they had the cash they really wouldn't need bitcoin.
I have been toying with the idea of what if they  issued a Bitcoin Backed Drachma.
Basically they could freeze all Euros, ban transactions in Euros, force people to turn in their Euros, and issue them a Bit-Drachma, a paper wallet with a Key that references a fractional account.  Of course there are still risks of counter-fitting the paper wallet. The primary key-holder is the Greek Government. So the underlying bitcoin funds cannot be moved.  The Bit-Drachmas could be traded and de-valued as need to supply liquidity or they can reduced the supply by allow exchanges for bitcoins.

And yet, bitcoin keeps working.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:06:56
Bitcoin seems to have the exact opposite characteristics for a network with low transfer costs.
1. Slow confirmation times
2. High Security
3. Scare limited resource.
I wouldn't be surprised if the fees to transfer bitcoin a decade from now are quite high.
You cannot have both a scare resource and limitless transactions at zero cost.
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:21:15
I for one would love to see the whole blocksize debate shelved for the next six months.
Its much ado about nothing ,the network shows just how resilient it is. People worry about onboarding 7 billion people, and yet they cry over minor attack, that will go away and has absolutely done zero to impact the soundess of bitcoin.
Instead you get Devs realizing that their are simple pull requests that can nip these minor attacks in the bud, and all wallet makers realized that they need to provide better wallet interfaces.
Ant-fragile at its best.

Is this really a bitcoin devs fault or an economic reality.  
The only way micro-transactions work is to have a gatekeeper filter the transactions to keep out the bad from the good.  Obviously no such thing exists in bitcoin and that's why they belong off-chain.
 
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:38:13
I have not gotten that economics is the sole reason for the block size not having been raised. But it is a major consideration in so much as; No one wants to damage bitcoin network or lose money on their bitcoins (Do No Harm)
2. No one is trying to artificially create fees, fees will come as a result of the point where current state of "mass adopted technology", the cost of a running a decentralized network, and consumer demand meet.  Obviously its possible to shift these variables around by affecting them in the programming in various ways, everyone is pretty familiar to some extent how they interplay.  But no one is putting forth artificial scarcity arguments.
My thoughts the argument comes down to the following decisions;
1. What does consensus agree the block size limit should be raised to? (At this point is pretty clear if the block size could be magically raised with no technical impact or fork issues it would have been done)  But I think that its 99% that the block size should be raised in some fashion.  But what is the right number?
2. Can this be a one time thing, can some additional work be implemented so that there is never a need to raise the block size limit via hard fork?
On question 1, the primary issue is if you allow  miners to mine whatever block size they want, whats to prevent large attacks of block sizes, what to prevent a reduction in node count, what prevents a high orphan rate.  All these on the extreme result in a more centralized network.   Visa and Master Card have worldwide user bases but no one would claim they are decentralized.  So then what is the part of bitcoin we want decentralized?  
At this point in seems like the safe side of a block increase is in the 2-8mb range. However this just kicks the can down the road for what 1 year 2 years, who knows what explosive growth is around the corner, or what services just got economically incentivized to add more data to the block chain because we increase the block size.  So that bring us to question 2.
On question 2, there is no real clear proposal yet that prevents us from having this same discussion, 1 year, 2 year or 5 years from now.  Will lightning network permit us to avoid this issue, it also has its own block size requirements. What about side chains, or can some mechanism be built in that allows for perpetual block increments, similar to difficulty adjustments?
So right now we are stuck, until some consensus can build around points 1 and 2.
I see the issue as completely a technical one, the economics come into play to the extent that no one wants to make mining unprofitable or further centralized, and no wants to make running nodes so expensive that only a handful of people run nodes.  No one wants to make bitcoin so expensive to transact that only the Central Banks and Visa can afford to use bitcoin, which is the same end result as points 1 and 2.
I really think that maybe some kind of Development Conference behind close doors would allow some consensus building without the Reddit drama everytime some has an idea it gets posted and beat down. There is reason credible scientific research is not done that way.   A lot of work in the technical and scientific world gets done in these closed door sessions.  
I am pretty confident that something will eventually come forth there are a lot of bright minds working on this.

Labor theory of money is archaic and debunked.  This theory is equivalently value less.  There is no inherent value to bitcoin because you solved a math problems with your computer.

I think part of this problem is that users and wallet makers have been hyping bitcoin to show instant transactions. When that does not exist in Bitcoin. They show that having a little "bing" receive bitcoins and then confirmations afterwards leads people to believe that confirmation process is some back-end cleanup.
In fact Wallets should simply state, Bitcoin Transaction "Observed" and then enter a state of Processing. Where the user is allowed to select what they to consider to be a completed transaction,  1 conf, 2, 3, etc.
Thats it.  This whole thing is something that is a confusion of language and people still want to believe that  a transaction has occurred when it has not.
Wallets maybe should not even display bitcoins received until after 1-3 confirmations with an increasing % of success.
Yes instant transactions will die off or motivated the rollout of side chaines, lighting, but so be it.  They never existed in the 1st place, its an illusion.

Depends what your criteria are for safety. I use both, they have pros and cons:
Mycelium (personal wallet) you have control over the keys it also means you need to be responsible and practice good security and data retention.
Even if you practice good security and data retention you can make mistakes.  I just realized I left a copy of my wallet on my old phone, and I suspect it may have been stolen since I can't find it.  There is a gap of several weeks between realizing I lost my phone and it when it was lost. Providing a possible attack vector. Sure I practice good password security but you never know anything can happen.
With Coinbase you you have to trust a third party so there is risk. Coinbase does offer a vault service with multisig where they store the keys and you keep a copy, and you need 2 signatures to release funds.  You also need to provide identity verification information, and you never know if future laws may change with bitcoin.
The fact is just like investing in the real world, it safe to diversify and manage your risk.   
The great thing about bitcoin is how easy it to setup multiple wallets and accounts and spread the risk.

I don't understand how people think that claiming your money isn't safe in bank is going to advance Bitcoin's cause.
Especially with a VC or Investor who is financially savy. You look like a loon.  Its typical that people have 100 dollars in Savings, say they can't trust banks. Meanwhile the millionaire sleeps at night with 500K in cash in a various deposits.  
Name one time in the last 80 years that anyone has last 1 penny in a bank account to a government takeover or collapse in the US.  FDIC Insurance works, and has worked well. Even during the meltdown of 2008.  You can bitch and complain that the taxpayers paid for it but it doesn't change the reality that no one lost money.
There are a lot of benefits to bitcoin. But to argue that your money isn't safe in a bank that is insured.  And instead it's safer in a 5 year old technology, that has shown absurd volatility and requires some advance IT knowledge to store safely.

Now I am not one overly concerned with mainstream adoption. I really believe Bitcoin is not meant for mainstream use, and believe its best case would be for institutions, high net worth individuals, who can afford to secure and manage  bitcoins.
The fact is most new technology, has to be adopted and polished at the fringes before it can ever reach the mainstream.  
The use case for bitcoin as day to payment sytems is a real stretch right now. I need to convert dollars to bitcoins to pay a merchant who is going to convert it back to dollars anyways.  To what not give my credit card, they already have it on file, save money, nope its costing me more in the conversion process.

Bitcoin has yet to prove it can survive a massive liquidity crisis.
If we encounter a 2008 financial crisis there weren't enough dollars and people feared a bank run, Gold collapsed initially because people needed to liquidate assets.
If your taxes, housing, food, need to be paid in US Dollars or Euro's and there is global deflation, it maybe that bitcoin is liquidated to meet the needs.
In addition, VC investment would dry up, many Bitcoin companies are not profitable and require VC support as the economy and infrastructure is built out.
This is a black swan event I worry about and would be a real test for bitcoin.
So your friend is not wrong in saying that Bitcoin needs the real economy to continue growing.  
Maybe in the future bitcoin doesn't need it but I doubt very much that's the case today.

I understand it sucks to have to provide so much information,. but Coinbase has every right to protect itself.  The Government expect Coinbase to perform a due dilegence if not they could be liable for any problems.

Actually this shows how bitcoin doesn't really add any value in these scenarios. Despite several years of turbulence around the world, in Argentina, Venezuela, Ukraine, Greece, China. No one is using bitcoin to skirt capital controls, because its not necessary. Because black markets work pretty well, and the exact same processes you have to jump through to get to bitcoin, you save a step by stopping at a major currency like a Euro, or USD. Once you have cash in these currencies 90% of the work is done. Most people who are moving large amount of funds have multiple bank accounts around the world.
Until Cash is banned Bitcoin has limited appeal for capital control evasion.

Some thoughts:
1. How does bitpay plan on making money?   1-2 million a year processing transactions doesnt cover their payroll. They need to increase their business by a factor of 10, yet it only went up by 50% YOY, that's not VC early stage growth rates, that's late stage after IPO.
2. If you believe Bitpay is 50% of the merchant processing market, that means roughly $300 million in Bitcoin commerce sales, while we spend $300 million on security.  Sure it doesn't cover black market, investment holders etc.  But something has to move, either the network is over secured or Bitcoin is about to experience explosive growth.  Reality is probably in the middle.
3. Bitcoin is tool of the white elite.  $25 million on precious metals, and $76 million on mining hardware.  There is no real consumer volume.
I think this places on hold the meme of Bitcoin as payment tool.  It's not.
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:23:55
I agree with you that Bitcoin's core use a currency or consumer payment system is extremely weak for consumers. But merchants are so desperate to improve their bottom line they are willing to try it out. I just hope they have the patience to put up with the extremely low adoption curve, Its going to be years.
From an investor point of view. Bitcoins combination of characteristics makes a better gold.  That's were bitcoin needs to be.  Everything people ascribe to bitcoin, you can ascribe to Gold.  We dumped gold as a payment system, and as currency because its not very good. It has storage costs, so does bitcoin, it has personal risk, so does bitcoin, its decentralized, it has a pretty fixed supply.   The big advantages over gold, howeer its portability and transmission ability, are really whats needed in the modern age. 
That's were i see bitcoin fitting in and its real launch point will become once larger net worth individuals get access to it via ETF and  regulated platforms.

Amazing what a 100 million dollars can buy today.
Let me check the price of bitcoin, nada.  Clearly the market isn't buying what 21 is up to yet.
Isn't this like building ethereum on Rasberry Pis.  Ethereum integrated the programming into their blockchain, 21 is trying build a network of self-running lowcost IoT devices to execute blockchain transactions and contracts.  
21's current business model would only work, if the block chain can sustain micro transactions, which I guess is still up for debate.  
 Is it possible the mining is irrelevant? The goal here is to bootstrap a network of hard wallets that are running on 21's OS.  One could argue, why not just sell trezor like device with preloaded, bitcoins. I think that would turn 21  into a MSB, and cause problems.  
But once the network of 21 wallets is out there, lets say they have 1 million devices deployed, and the users want to top off bitcoin, they could go the 21 portal and complete the transaction via preferred Bitcoin Broker. 21 could broker a placement deal and avoid the MSB issues.   User doesnt need to worry about wallet addresses, or any of the complications that bitcoin has.
Or a new Bitcoin service pops up they can to 21 and market it their deployed user base.
21 is trying to be the Apple of bitcoin if that's possible.

If that was the case you would see growth in transactions, more merchant usage, and the numbers don't show that people use bitcoin more.  In fact I bet there is an inverse relationship with the length of time one has owned bitcoin and the frequency with with you use it day to day.  I.E. you play with Bitcoin and spend it when you first get it and then you let it sit and forget about it over time.  No successful payment system has that type of profile.
Sure a decade from now Bitcoin adoption maybe so hight that people are using it to transact. But like I said for the here and now Bitcoin's future is not in consumer adoption.

If you transmit Bitcoins for Fiat, and you do it on your own without using an exchange you are an MSB. There is no threshold. There is no personal use or investment exemption.    
Keep in mind an exchanger for FINCEN is anyone that takes FIAT in exchange for Alternate Currency.

What are they going to deliver revenue with? Their business model is pretty horrible, Bitpay will not see 2016.
The whole point of bitcoin is for merchants and consumers to bypass payment processors and save money. Assuming Merchants can convince users to use bitcoin, which has been pretty epic fail so far. So where exactly does bitpay make money.  
They have to assume tremendous liabilities, be compliant, and to what skim a fraction or nothing of transactions, from a non existent market. 2% * 0% = ??
The fact is this is the nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as consumer payment system for the next 5 years.  No one cares for it. Overstock adopted, Buy.com, Newegg, Virgin Galatic, Microsoft,  Wikipedia, doesn't matter.  User are not paying with Bitcoin, its dead, dead, dead.
Its over.  
Now if people can get back to worrying about keeping bitcoin as a layer 1 decentralized store of value, or devs need to start working on a system which can provide a platform for real new applications to be built like lighting or move over to ethereum.  There is way more exciting things on paper and in practice there in the last 90 days than whats happend in r/bitcoin in the last 365.  And maybe this is a good thing for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the anchor to the crytopworld, if ever this anchor should fail, the entire system will collapse and it will take a generation (internet time) to replace it.
Circle and Coinbase are also in lala land  living of other people money. Except they are selling the only product bitcoin has to offer, Bitcoins.  Right now there is no other viable business model. 
If you are not brokering bitcoins, you are not making money. And even with the price collapse and continued bear market not sure how profitable brokering is its probably just enough to cover Allaire's and Armstrong, Haircut budget.

Here is good explanation on one aspect.
Here is my lay attempt.
Larger blocks lead to smaller mining pools being pushed out ( you can't compete because you don't have the connection to relay larger and larger transactions fast enough) and node counts be reduced because storage and bandwidth costs go up.  Its just common sense, if you raise the transaction cost of the network, someone has to carry that cost, eventually small players are pushed out and more and more specialize players take over.  the risk for example, is lets say bitcoin goes to 25 Billion with 50MB blocks, but there are only 1000 nodes in the world that can process bitcoin transactions, 300 nodes in China in 3 data centers, 300 nodes in North America, and 330 nodes spread out around the world.
How hard do you think it is for example to go to a handful of node operators who at this point are just miners, and a few companies, and tell them, listen if you broadcast bitcoin transactions and you are regulated business you need to run red lists, and work with law enforcement.   This won't happen overnight, but developers know from how email, ISPs have been co opted that if you don't fight the fight and maintain a constant integrity of the network its just a matter time of time before people take over.
Governments have no problem identifying and regulating 1000's so if you push bitcoin down a path were only a handful of corporations are running nodes, corporations are not freedom fighters they are businesses and if the goal is to just build a payment network ala paypal and have all the same rules and crap, then whats the point.
Now imagine a bitcoin that stays laughably small at 1MB 10 years from now and lets say it also 25 Billion dollars, but it cost $10.00 to broadcast a bitcoin transaction.  Well that crazy expensive and its probably too high, however if the network is decentalized like today, and anyone can run a node then even if China and the U.S. decide to ban it it would be as futile and going after torrents.  And really when do you need to send a secure uncensorable transaction?  For important things.  
These are extremes, but in one scenario bitcoin limit can be raised and we have a baseline and bitcoin is still decentralized, in the other scenario bitcoin is dead.

I predict a future fork where a Core Bitcoin that envisions this wins anyones. The superior Coin will always be the truly decentralized one.  network effects mean nothing at the user level for Bitcoin.  If 1 billion people "used" bitcoin via SPV wallets, but all the Nodes where hosted by Google, microsoft, Intel and Facebook. Who cares. That has accomplished nothing, and bitcoins would be worthless because Google and such don't need to be compensated for mining. They would have external funding of the securing of the network enabling free transmissions in return for total overisight and view into the network.

So I agree I never believed in Bitcoin ever being Money like the USD per say but  Money is a spectrum that can shift and there are levels of money if you will.  
Can I pay my kids tuition in Google Stock? Nope, not money, is Google Stock worthless?  Nope. Gold is another example, not money in the U.S., but there are use cases around the world where it acts a money.  Bitcoins use case are more broad then simply being sought after by people fleeing Government. 
I have always felt bitcoin is more real estate I have used this example many times.  Like Buying land in NY in 1850's a pretty sorry state of affairs. But if you manage to hold on, it will have value because there is an entire ecosystem that will be build around over the next few decades.  So from that perspective, if you believe that crypto is here to stay, and Bitcoin will continue to function and remain censorship resistance than over the long view it will have value.

Missing the boat, lets break down the cost of an iPhone, or Dell PC.
I don't know if 21 will succeed but I understand what they are trying to do.  If you don't start building layer 2 hardware, bitcoin will go no where.  Everyone uses the internet analogy.  the internet works because there are devices that the average person can grab and go just turn and go, and infrastructure of services that operate in similar manner.  Routers, Gateways, Servers, Computers.  If every service relied on people and companies rolling their own solution, the internet would never have worked.
The mining is irrelevant, and too many people, myself included got fixated on it.  Its the end around to deploy prefilled hardware wallets running on 21's custom OS.
Once they are in the wild, you can top em off however you want.
Now is this going to work who knows, but if you people want an IoT bitcoin everywhere world you need embedded systems to do that, you need standardized OS's you need scripting and common languages that can enable automated services. 
Then you go the early adopters and developers who can maybe begin testing and looking how they would incorporate additional services ontop of this new pipeline.
You need a layer 2, that will enable Layer 3 
Now the catch here, is that I believe Ethereum negates 50% of what 21 is doing.  In so much as Ethereum removes a lot of hardware/software from the equation because it has embedded scripting.  Also, its not clear that the IoT is not overblown. I am not convinced that there is this world of micro transactions waiting to explode, I have yet to see a sound economic model.  Everyone says you can build a fortune on scrapping pennies, but no one every seems to.
Also its clear 21 is bucking to be the Apple of Bitcoin, custom OS/Hardware solution and big first mover network. the iTunes Bitcoin or App Store.
If they can succeed, what does bitcoin look like in 5 years where 21 has 10 million IoT devices running their custom OS and interfacing with the blockchain, does the blockchain even matter or does what matter is tapping into 21's network of 10 million devices.

@_date: 2015-04-07 15:56:55
Too Lazy to verify this, just going of my head so feel free to slap me down:
The concept of the token (bitcoin) predates Satoshi. Didn't Adam Back come up with as a way to control spam on email systems.  The problem he had he couldn't decentralize the trust part and the unique token, and if you are issuing virtual tokens you are printing money.
a blockchain is a database.  How do you control trash and spam?  You need to charge for the cost.  
So there will always be a token or charge on an open database if not you can take it down easily.
Bitcoin is the first to merge, the Database with the token, in a way that requires no central authority.
BUt its  three legged stool.
* 1. Decentralized and Open, everyone can write to the database. 
* 2. Charge for access / A token or some economic cost needs to be imposed to reduce spam
* 3. Mathematical release of token, so that the Token cannot be abused or used as an attack vector.
Once you start messing with the 3 components of bitcoin, you quickly are back to square 1, A database with a Central Authority, that needs to be trusted or a token issued by someone that needs to be trusted.

Look up the post of the person who tried doing P2P Bitcoin lending, complete failure.  Banks lend money at these interest rates because it was needed to be profitable, and people borrow at these interest rates because that's what the market will loan to that pool and stay profitable. You cannot arbitrage risk away. This is a great businss for the borrower but the lenders go broke.    So no Bitcoin offers nothing new over existing loan systems, except bypassing the credit process that is in place to protect the lender and the borrower.

I don't believe Bitcoin will ever be a "mainstream" payment system. Because people use what the value least to use as a payment system. It may underpin some settlement systems. 
In a world where Bitcoin is a "gold" standard people will not break off a bitcoin to buy some coffee. They will spend fiat or pledge their bitcoins and borrow against them. 
I don't see a scenario where a deflationary currency becomes the primary payment system. I can't think of an economic case where that has occurred. Eventually the more valuable currency falls out of circulation as its hoarded and we are living it now with Bitcoin to some extent. see Gersham's law.

Coinmap is useless, probably 90% of those listings are dead. Also Bitcoin transactions doesnt tell you what component is actual consumer level transactions, based on merchant reports it doesn't appear there is any traction.  
its a supposition but fair enough if your personal experience is different.
I meant Immediate Future (ate my words there), consumer adoption may come way down the road. But even then I am not sure there will be a time where people are actually running bitcoin wallets and transacting in Bitcoin.  It maybe integrated into other payment options or underpinning some backend.  Consumers don't care how the sausage is made, they just want good sausage. Bitcoin is really a protocol and its very gritty technology. Like worrying about explaining to your grandma why she should use SMTP vs POP for her emails.

The problem is that Airbnb and Uber are breaking local rules with little risk of jail time. Fines maybe.
Any company taking on Finance regulations is taking on the US Government, with risk of major fines, jail time, and being branded of assisting terrorists, etc.
So far no companies have really done that, a perfect example is payment processors and gambling industry.  Online gambling in the U.S. Isn't even illegal, but the threat is implied, and so it moved offshore and with passage of the bill going after payment processors, online gambling in the U.S was pretty decimated.
The progress Bitcoin and finance tech is making will be drip drip, but consumers and businesses expect more, and they will push finance to evolve, regulators so far have been pretty lax.  
So I think it will take time, but I don't expect anyone to try and pull a move like flaunting the rules because it will quickly be shut down. Governments are blind to losing slow control, however if you but a big billboard that advertise you will incur a response, a perfect example was encryption. Governments may not be able shutdown technology, but they are very good at watering it down to the point that its effectively useless.
Now that Apple and Google are advertising that they are encrypting services, Governments want to ban that, even though the ability to encrypt data is as old as the internet.

Arguing with people here that deflation is not bad is pointless.  They somehow believe that all the problems in the world are ascribed to inflationary currency. When its the exact opposite. Its like Anti-vaxxers who don't realize they have the (had) the luxury of not vaccinating their kids because everyone else is vaccinated.
One need only look at history and look at all the wars fought over currencies and fixed currencies, and the feudal systems that result from having a small minority control the economy because they controlled the gold or fixed asset forcing a perpetual deflation.
Currencies are just a unit of exchange nothing more they are an means to end. But people here believe they are the means and the end. 
I always use the analogy.  I should be wealthy because my great grandfather dug a nugget out of the ground.
Do people really believe that at some point the world will just sit by and allow a small group  of people to control the bulk of the wealth simply because they got bitcoin first. Its ridiculous, markets and people don't work that way.

I also disagree in that, your ability to hide wealth is always equal to the technology available to you and your pursuers.  I.E. its a draw.
Where you can hide your wealth in Bitcoin, doesn't mean its hidden since the Government today can know exactly how much wealth you should have, how you earned and spent it down to the penny. Thats all that matters. That you have bitcoin is a wallet is irrelevant, if the Gov says you owe 500K in back taxes.  You can flee and run, but if worth it they will track you down, or make your life miserable.

You may want to value Bitcoins in machine tools, but no one manufacturers or sources raw materials in Bitcoins to produce the machines tools, nor pays labor, nor pays taxes.

I don't believe Bitcoin will ever work as currency. Gresham's law.  We are seeing it in full in effect. Bitcoin merchant transactions are going no where. Except for the very faithful who want to jump through hoops to complete a transaction, Bitcoin retail transactions don't exist.  It is completely irrational to spend something which could be very valuable in the futre to acquire something which will continue to fall in value.
Bitcoin transactions are negligble, and will remain so.  
Do you melt your families jewelry to avoid spending your precious dollars.  No if you really believe dollars are worthless papers printed to enslave you the first thing you reach for to pay for your delicious egg mcmuffin will  be your worthless dollars.

Here is where I see merchant adoption grinding to a halt. The current legal environment is neutral to bitcoin, but hostile to money services.  
All these merchants running headlong to transact bitcoin are really trying to become money transmitters indirectly (In the eyes of the U.S. Gov).
So you have to go through these giant hurdles which will probably only get worse, unless the US goes out of its way to simplify compliance for bitcoin. The likelyhood of that is small.
So you have Coinbase and Bitcoin trying to make money charging a measely 1% while dealing with enormous liabilities and compliance issues that are probably greater than what a merchant processor deals with and they get to charge 3%. On top of having to become licensed money transmitter in every state, which they are not, and walking a legal gray line.
Setting up a merchant account is pretty straight forward for a credit card processor or paypal.
So how long will people bang their heads against the wall that is U.S. Regulations in order to push bitcoin forward at the merchant level.  Or how long before someone or something gets their ass handed in a major fraud, and the Regulators come gunning for coinbase or bitpay.
Coinbase and Bitpay are living on investor money, and if Bitcoin doesn't boom in the next year or two, they probably wont be around for much longer.

You guys think, Tax Authorities are going to sit back, and allow you to generate income tax free, or shelter money.
In the US and I am sure in the western world, financial institutions need to supply at end of year a list of customers who used their services, and incurred taxable events.  In addition they need to conduct regular withholding. 
So in the real world its a non issue. And most legit Bitcoin enterprises are probably complying
Also Decentralized exchanges with Fiat will never happen, because what people are really asking for is, for the person who ends up with Fiat to run the risk of illegal transactions in their territory.   Also, Decentralized exchanges will never provide the realtime market clearing that is needed to support large transaction volumes.

Problem is security is a huge problem for Bitcoin and there is no easy solution.  AT the rate we are going by 2100 all bitcoins will have either been stolen once or lost in an uncrackable file.
The fact is bitcoin theft is the perfect crime for online hackers, you steal practically untraceable liquid currency. An now that merchants accept bitcoin an easy way to launder, or you can just list coins on Bitquick, or do localbitcoins.
I believe the hacking wave has yet to truly begin.

The standard in online commerce is to pay upon shipment, not after you receive and play with your toy.
Multi-sig is more to the benefit of buyers, and are Vendors who are carrying all the risk, really going to allow an anonymous buyer and anonymous arbiter to determine if they are going to get paid on the MDMA they shipped.

You bring up some good points but there were several factors going on at that time.
1.The fall in PC prices and the penatration of the Home PC.  
2. Email had already been entrenched in the corporate world for almost a decade, before it hit consumers.
3. The Internet growth of the 90's fueled by dial up providers primarily AOL, which gave people a reason to be online and communicate.
4. The favorable economic environment which fueled massive money to build out infrastructure.
5. As someone mentioned, Email vs Snail mail or phone calls, was a leap forward in communication.
Bitcoin has none of these factors.
1. Remittances is marginal problem that affects a subset of the populations
2. Unbanked, Anti-Credit Card, Angry Libertarians is another minor subset which also represents a subset of the economy,
3. Bitcoin Investment money is  a tear in the eye of fly versus the money that was flowing in the 90's to build AOL, Hotmail, Yahoo,  and the internet in general.
4. Email and the internet while a new process was somewhat intuitive, sending an email was mostly like writing a letter, connecting to the internet required a CD install and connecting a phone line, and none of this risked anyone financial well being.
Compare this with Bitcoin, where one needs to learn about wallet encryption, which wallet to use, private keys/public keys, return addresses, confirmation times, conversion rates, highly volatile currency,  Or use a service like coinbase, where you need 2FA authentication, vaults, all the while carrying the burden of financial loss.
I really believe we are more like like the early stages of gophermail, usenet, where there was limited expectations and few saw the use for email beyond the university or corporate department.
Bitcoin has yet to have a killer app, there is still limited reasons for anyone to use bitcoin beyond specific use cases.  Even with merchant adoption, i don't really spend my bitcoins or go  out of my way to use a merchant, used it a few times it was great.

The point is unless fundamentals justify such behavior it is not sustained. 
For bitcoin to justify worrying about deflation it would need to be a national currency in a G20 nation. That will never happen and I hope it doesn't.

I am a blocksize conservative, and it would be Foolish, not increase the blocksize and create a process to have scaling blocksize.
Inaction on the part of Bitcoin development, would mean that we relinquish the future of bitcoin to outside forces.
We need scaling blocksize, lighting networks, sidechains, all of them are necessary, and all of them require larger blocksizes to work as far as I understand.
 
Here is how I veiw it;
You are the Mayor of a small town, with happy citizens.  Your town continues to attract new residents.   You feel that continued growth will bring big problems, and change your town.  You choose not allow expansion of the town, thinking that it will keep it small and the residents happy. As a result  the rejected residents begin living on the outskirts of the town, they build up their own town and follow their own policies which includes setting up a Casino, running a major highway, and other things which in the end impact your small town anyways.  By choosing to do nothing, you have chosen to allow unforseen consequences to decide your fate 100%.
Even if we just want bitcoin to be the Settlement system for Central Banks (a highly unlikely scenario), the blocksize is at stands needs to go up.

Well ISPs are required by law to KYC via COPA, they must verify that they are dealing with an Adult, and if they suspect they are not they need to block the account. Also, ISP are pretty good at self policing and not enabling their services for illegal activities. Most major ISPs today do not permit anonymous accounts, and require some way of verification, also they are all required to retain access logs.  So that in reality you have psuedo-anonymity until a court order reveals your IP. You can be anonymous to the public, but there is no right to be anonymous to a service provider.
As much as AML and KYC laws can be a problem, they weren't invented to oppress the population.
I have posted before that Bitcoin businesses who sole job is to broker and hold Bitcoins are Banks, and have a social duty to users to comply with all regulations and be transparent.  If it prevents you from running Coinbase from your garage because of the compliance costs then don't get into the business of holding peoples money, fiat, bitcoin or otherwise.  That's the whole point of Bitcoin right, be your own bank?
Most here are to young to understand how big of a problem organized crime was in the middle part of the century and how close it was embedded in the fabric of our society in the  US particularly in major cities, like NY, LA. Mobsters and Unions were a huge problem, they still exist but they a fraction of what they were in the peak in the 70's.  The Bank Secrecy Act along  was written specifically to target Banks who were in bed with Mobsters that were basically turning a blind eye to money laundering, you had additional legislation passed in the 80's once the mobsters lost power and it shifted to the Cocaine Cartels in the 80's.
Does it stop it no, but it does mean that bankers can be held accountable to assisting organized crime. Yeah I know they don't always get held accountable, but a lot of organizations were brought down specifically via shutting down their financial operations.  Once the Bank Secrecy act came out along with RICO, banks started cleaning up also it probably accelerated the consolidation in the banking industry that started in the 80's as compliance costs went through roof.
As much as I love Bitcoin, so many here live under the First World Problem mentality that Bitcoin enables.  It truly is a white rich tech problem.  Many here are disconnected from the reality of why things are they way they are and no it isn't always about a federal government that is out to oppress people.   
So to your original point courts have ruled that anonymous free speech is protected right, but Anonymous banking or commerce is not really a right.

Aside from philosophical and cool tech reasons there aren't really any benefits to using bitcoin over a credit for a consumer, and in many cases more risks.
And these rage against the machines arguments is just stupid and childish. 
Bitcoin is just not there yet, and all these attempts to convince the average person to use bitcoin is a complete waste of time.
Its like people in the BBS days convincing people how awesome it was to run a BBS, and use a baud modem, to talk to other people online.
They were eventually right but it took years of infrastructure before the idea of message boards, and online communities took off for the average person.
Bitcoin is 5 years away at best from having the average person use bitcoin for an everyday transaction.

How does a developed country get developed? By having and enforcing rules.  You allow a free market to evolve but you do so within a framework that balances all participants, as best as possible.
Regulatory capture is always a problem, but its a problem of size in a capitalist system. Even in a low regulation system, the larger corporation will exert its weight and control. 
I don't disagree that we live in a highly regulated economy and that it has its problems. But to believe the deregulation is some panacea where individuals become empowered is also ridiculous. You need only see the amount of scamming going on in the Bitcoin world, because the wolves have free reign on the sheep.
I have no issue with this, Bitcoins strength its the ability to give those who want a more deregulated free economy interaction, but it also comes with the risks of that environment. I know the liberterians shouts that the way it should be only the strong survive, but that is exactly why we created the current societies we have in the west because of thousands of years of individual rights being trampled for the benefit of the powerful by birthright or inheritance.  And you guys completely miss the boat if you think the world wants to do away with western regulations.

it would take a creation of an interface that doesn't exist today in consumer wifi routers devices to enable sharing, encryption and receiving bitcoin payments and managing sessions, all the while providing the same level of performance, and stupid easy setup.
This types of features are advance settings that few people use.
Today all mesh networks are supported by enthusiasts who create nodes on the network and host session, you find some densities in high tech cities like San Francisco. But its an enthusiast thing.
TO get mass adaption it takes way more than bitcoin, in fact payment acceptance would not be a driver of this. People have been trying to monetize wifi, and it always been a failure except in hotels or areas where you have a captive audience.
In a utopian view the machines could autoshare wifi, collect the micropayments and deposit it to the master account and manage the sessions, and self heal. 
But that is 10 -15 years away.

So he left himself an out with Bitcoin 1.0.
Some days I wake up and feel bitcoin is a fad, it does some things great and some things marginally better.
1. POS transaction, bitcoin is only marginally better than swiping a credit card or in some cases poorer when people make errors, improved clients have eliminated but still its somewhat a draw.
2. Remittances, bitcoin kills the remittance market, nice to be able to send value anywhere in the world instantly.  However a lot has to be in place, before you can transmit bitcoin. The onboarding process is an issue in western countries. Still I can see bitcoin continue to move forward into this space.
3. Online Sales, Again bitcoin is great online payment tool, nices to just scan a QR code and be on your way, but in practice there are still clunky issues with interfaces. Many Bitcoin shopping carts remind me of the late 90's checkout process. 
4. Store of Value; in theory Bitcoin is a great Gold 2.0, but with crazy volatility its not, maybe in 20 years. Also the level of security needed to properly hold a significant amount of bitcoin and the amount of personal risk you need to take eliminates benefits of using at a store of value. There are hundreds of instruments that do a better job,unless you are planning for a financial collapse and maybe need to flee the border. Again that's a marginal scenario.
5. As Digital Fuel: here is the unknown untapped potential of bitcoin, the build out of new financial services in the Ether.  Something that wasn't possible before, micro payments, DACs, Autonomous Agents, this is still very raw, and probably 5 years away from any mainstream launch but this is what holds the most potential, and maybe where the killer app will lay.

All the things you mentioned existed in the early days of the iternet.MySpace preceeded Facebook. Comunity and social interaction networks  were predicted by Orson scott card in enders game.
I think  bitcoin could just be an early online value system.  But too many assume. Bitcoin won't be eclipsed.  Google eclipsed yahoo.
So many instances of first to market being eclipsed by someone else.
If anything the history of the Internet is that network effects are not permanent moats.

Because 99% of the people who are vocal about bitcoins come across as fucking loons and many of them have shady as shit pasts.  
The proposition of bitcoin is a pyramid scheme in part. Buy today because tomorrow it will be worth $50,000, only 21 million ever made. 
The people who are leaders in the field with the exception of some of the Devs are here because they were stupid to buy in early, and reaped wealth. Not because they did anything pioneering or special, they just bought a lotto ticket.  Like they people who invested with Bernie Madoff in the 70's cashed out in the 80's and thought he and them were fucking geniuses.
You then have an enormous community of get rich quick people who are hoping to cash in on the lotto ticket, and a bunch of snake oil salesmen who are more than happy to feed into their greed.  Then you have group of  thieves who realize that the giant mass greedgasm, allows people to make extremely bad decisions, under the delusion of changing the world, and being early adopters.
Like invest in fake mining companies, in China, or deposit cash in no name exchanges run by a french con-man or sending money to fake charities.
So of course, sane rational people who have spent decades building wealth look in here, and say "wtf?"
On top of that so many here have a deep seated visceral disdain for anyone who has succeed in the west, and the western culture.  They keep pitching bitcoin as the thing that collapses "the system" whatever that means.
So yeah you can see why a lot of people are sick as shit about hearing how bitcoin will cure cancer, if you just give it a chance.

Valid point and there are no good answers. 
You are your own bank so now you need to manage your own line of credit so to speak.
Its really a separation of multiple layers within the Financial System
For example.
Debit Card is charging to your cash account.  But would you really move your entire net worth onto Bitcoin, not today, and at what expense will the  insured bitcoin accounts be, when the Government offers FDIC insurance for FREE. Bitcoin wallets are like Debit Cards.  Bitcoin can't really compete with an Insured bank account. I know there are maniacs that do that. But sorry, I can't afford to miss a mortgage Payment, because I lost my Key or my wallet got hacked.   
Try explaining to your Lender that you kept their Mortgage money in bitcoins.
Credit Card.  You could have a Bitcoin Based Credit card.  But it would probably be more expensive, then a real credit card since they would not make money of merchants but of you as loan with all kinds of fees. More like a cash advance.  Also, there is no need for a merchant processing network, so no reward points or perks.  Seeing how there are no bitcoin credit cards, there probably won't be one.
Cash:  Cash is dying, so the younguns aren't used to carrying cash around. But I remember the days, my old man would always keep $500 in his wallet at all times. the question is do you feel comfortable carrying a high cash value on your phone or quick accessible account. 
Some people will probably manage their accounts, 
1. Phone with Spending money
2. Third Party Wallet, with Spending money x (X) , X being a value they can afford to lose in a worst case, but still its a low risk of loss.
3. Life money in a bank account.
In the end Credit Cards, and Bank accounts are not going anywhere. Doesn't mean bitcoin doesn't have its niche.

The trusted merchant or marketplace and the Trusted account resolver.
There is no solution to theft in bitcoin land without a disincentive to steal.

Real world regulation is going to hurt more honest bitcoiners because of the nature of bitcoin. it will work at the periphery  the exchanges As we see now all the hoops coinbase has to jump through.
but regulators will regulate whether people like it or not.
Read through bitcointalk at people who have been scammed. The first reaction demand the money back, second reaction get the authorities invokved.
In the end it's going to happen because criminals don't care about utopia.  The paradox here is you make stronger anonymity you may just break bitcoin and make it unusable by honest people.  If you keep it the way it is it can be hobbled by blacklists.
This will continue to be bitcoins existential crisis.

Bitcoin is forcing a lot of discussions, but It has yet to realize any meaningful impact.
It will make some changes over time, but there is so much hype and circlejerking its hard to separate fact from fiction.
1. Aside from some bitcoin exchanges, I believe that 95% of all bitcoin companies are money losers, toss in Bitpay with that.  Their burn rate must be outstanding and I cant get my head around the volume of transactions need to cover sponsoring a Bowl game. Its wild conjecture, but I have yet to see any real business models. Only crowd funding or vaporware.
Possible profitable businesses, 
1. Hardware wallets (straight up business build something+profit tiny market)
2. Miner Manufacturers  (even though all of them have been scams)
3. Exchanges. (enormous liability, only profitable until hacked)
4. Hacking/Scams
2. Nothing new has been proposed in the bitcoin space in the last 2 years.  That has already been discussed in the previous 4.
3. A lot of development and talk about internet of things, decentralization, nothing has happened and nothing will happen any time soon that may bring these things to market.  Bitcoin reminds more about Online Video service in the early 90's. Where the companies where just ahead of their time and did not survive, because they needed 10 years of network buildout, and better PCs. I suspect a lot of bitcoin companies will be the same.  Bitcoin is still so nascent that it looks like another decade of evolution before any real uptake.
4. Bitcoin adoption is slowed, not accelerating, there is nothing fundamentally different today than last year that would accelerate bitcoin adoption among consumers or general population.  The Price crash has unmasked that only driver of bitcoin was price appreciation, that's it. All the other free you money, be your own bank, baloney are not selling points to the majority of Westerners.  It maybe that the onboarding of the 99% is what drives bitcoin, but the wealth of the world which what bitcoin is trying to make a dent is owned by the 1%
Merchant acceptance will not accelerate bitcoin adoption among consumers. Only ideologues think its a good idead to jump through the hoops and risks of bitcoin conversion in order to buy a product you were already buying with a credit card or cash. Excessive porn habits and gambling not withstanding. And even then the fact that Bitcoin has failed to make even a dent in the gambling and porn industry shows, that bitcoin has a long long long road to merchant adoption.
5. Regulatory environment; continues to be neutral to downright hostile with regards to bitcoin particularly in the U.S.  This also has a big effect on bitcoin expansion.  Companies like Coinbase and Circle are operating in a legal gray zone, as long as nothing bad happens with bitcoin they will tread water, but if something bad does happen and the wind shifts in washington they will be torched.  No one in Washington gives two satoshis if Bitcoin doesn't exist next year.
Circle was supposed to be big deal and bring Bitcoin to consumers, its been a big bust. It just shows how hard it is to convert USD to bitcoins even when you are willing to do it for free because of regulation.
The good news, bitcoin is not going anywhere it's not going to disappear tomorrow, its going to continue to persist and gnaw bit by bit into something, but its going to take a few years.
I would add on a micro level, its interesting to see time and again people microfund via tipping or bitcoin donations in threads, but that has been possible since day one and its impact is so tiny.
@_date: 2015-03-28 14:29:42

Not surprising.
1. There isn't much to do in Bitcoin beyond mining or selling them.
2.  I can't think of a single bitcoin company that seems to have any viable business model that isn't completely dependent on the price going up.
Here's Boost VC portfolio and all their startups are either bitcoin brokers, exchange, online wallets(really brokers) or dead links.
I think there is a lot of hype in these "blockchain" companies.
Bitcoin as a protocol is pretty simple, store and transfer value between untrusted parties.  It works well, and what is needed is funding of core development and steady hands to continue to Shepard the protocol to keep doing what its doing.
I am still don't see much to do in Bitcoin beyond that, the notarization and record keeping to me is very niche, maybe there is a future where my car title lives on the blockchain, but I am not convinced. Because these are regulatory issues not technical problems.  And really it could live on any blockchain, do I need to pay a future premuim to be on Bitcoins.  Also if it goes that way, in some mass deregulation, the whole process would be automated, so why do I need a 3rd party to record it for me.
IoT in bitcoin is pretty limited because of Bitcoins nature and if there is a future there its going to be in Ethereum if it lives up to its potential. 
Everything else in bitcoin is dependent on 3rd parties, or the mythical Lightning Network and Side chains. Which again if Ethereum ramps up may eventually kill of that development.
I am not worried about this trend, Bitcoin is Alpha, the original, if the world adopts crypto, blockchains, ethereum etc. The Gold standard, the Broad and Wall, will be bitcoin.

In Venezuela, there are strict exchange controls and fixed rates, so there is a huge dollar black market.  
If you read the thread most respondents like the idea of bitcoin, but see no point, except maybe to make digital purchases.  But the people right now don't need digital they need toilet paper, soap and food.
Now if you could setup a black market business with the backing of inside government agent, you may do ok, converting Bolivars to bitcoins so that the fat cats can get money out of Venezuela, but then you yourself needs to figure out a way to launder the growing stash of Bolivars preferably by running an export business of some kind like car parts. You also need to this outside the country and hope the guy inside isnt ripping you off to bad. 
TL DR;
Venezuelan on the street doesn't get the idea of swapping his unstable currency for U.S. Dollar on the black market to then swap it for another unstable currency.

Actually most investors tend to not hold commodities directly and invest in the companies themselves.
Gold, Copper, Oil.
Bitcoin is another commodity, and will always be volatile and cyclical, so  think investing in the companies can be a sound strategy especially when your a Peter Thiel who is getting in on Early round and has multiple ways to cash out. 
Too many here assume that a bitcoin in the future will always be worth more, it maybe the case, but markets work on their own lifespan not humans, and investing is always about opportunity cost.
Many here don't remember the gold bear market of 1980, where Gold peaked and was a losing trade for 20 years straight, meanwhile the stock market was a bull for 20 years.

Funny how the real world keeps encroaching in bitcointopia.
These exchanges operate in  the real world and there is every reason to believe that it's just a matter of time before law enforcement gets involved  and they can claw back those funds in fiatt or even hold the exchanges liable for moving stolen property Not to mention possible civil liabilities.
Does this affect the fungibilty of bitcoin. MAYBE.
Adam Back has been complaining for a while this would happen.  But it's a risk of bitcoin open ledger.  The fact is and bitcoin is proving that the pseudoanon.of bitcoin is a primary attraction of criminals..  freedom fighters not withstanding. Bitcoin has become a haven for criminals and scam  artists.  Bitcoin is showing how absent clear laws eventually parties self organize because they get tired of getting ripped off.  This is life in anarchy land In the wild fronteir. All the fears of the governments sabotaging bitcoin  have been unfounded. The largest  harm to bitcoin has come from bad actors. 
It's amazing to watch a true social experiment in action. It also shows how childish many anarchist views against the modern world are. It's not perfect and we want to make it better, but the people of the world are not ready for the rugged individualism of bitcointopia.

| one of the most expensive parts of Bitcoin due to hacking 
This part is true and becoming truer, bitcoins nature makes hacking a win win. Its asymetrical and it will always cost an insane amount to actually secure your bitcoin today vs the cost to steal them. Its why Bitcoin 1.0 business that actually hold the bitcoin keys are liability bombs. 
Its also a hidden cost of bitcoin that people who use it and are honest about its limits realize that the security costs in a fiat and credit system are shared via insurance and the governments who protect their currency.  In bitcoin land those costs are pushed directly to the user.  Sure if you have $500 in bitcoin you may not invest in security, but how does a future bitcoin world fucntion when a Fortune 1000 has to carry the cost of holding bitcoin, or a small business that cannot afford security.
So you end up having to setup trusted parties that can handle security for you.

Why are they trolls?  They make valid points there is no point for someone in the west to use Bitcoin to buy online without massive incentive
Ive been holding bitcoin since 2013, and only spent on newegg once when they had the massive sale and bitcoin discount.
Other than that, my credit card, debit card or paypal get the same job done.
Rather than call people trolls realize the limitations that bitcoin has today.
It makes no sense to take a dollar, pay coinbase fee turn it into bitcoin, send it to new egg, who has my credit card on file to order a product, when I get points for my credit card, or if just want pay cash use debit.
Yes I get the security and not sharing information and all that fun stuff, but its pointless since i shared way more personal information with Coinbase, who is a nothing company compared to Newegg who has only my credit card and mailing address.

its irrelevant, you can study the code. the point is like asking who has the authority to change the official language of the U.S. from English to Pig Latin.  There is no real authority for that, and a change like is more than just uploading new code(changing the laws) because it needs to be accepted by the majority. 
In effect if Gavin Andresen one of many Bitcoin developers decided to upload new code increasing the number of bitcoins, the entire network, miners and users would have to decide to adopt it, if not bitcoin continues as is.  Even if some miners adopted they would be running on second network separate from the primary, creating a fork. 
Is it possible to increase the number of bitcoins absolutely. Is it probable, extremely rare.  About as likely, as New York City granting Bill Gates the ability to extend lower Manhattan by a square mile. All possible, but not probable.

Wihtout getting to deep you need to read up on the basis of the money system. Currency or cash or various forms it takes within the monetary system, are the bloodflow.  As mentioned they exist to service the system. Some savings is healthy and needed, but too much savings is bad. See Japan which has had a terrible economy for over two decades.
The fact APPLE and Google sit on this cash proves my point exactly, we are in a low growth borderline  deflation environment. So Companies strategies are currently, buy stock, issue dividends, or hold cash.
Our tax system punishes companies for issuing dividends, and its punishes them for repatriating cash, not a topic of the debate but a contributing factor.  Because companies see litttle incentive to invest they hold cash, thereby restricting the flow of money in the system. To many companies to do this, you get a recession, way to many a depression.
OUr economy would be better served if APPL issue 30 or 50 billion in distributions to investors who could spend or invest that money.
No one is forced to buy shit, but in a healthy economy currency is not an investment it is merely a deferment of investment or consumption.
I recommend you read read up on Cullen Roche who has been spot on with regards to the economy the last few years, and I feel has the most realistic understanding.

My point exactly, which is why you are wrong that Bitcoin and Gold survive in "No-QE" environment.
NO QE would mean that all assets would collapse in price, DEFLATION, because people needed to raise capital to service their dollar debt.  Its a repricing of assets to recognize the real liquidity in the environment. 
Which was precisely happening in 2008, when the credit markets seized, and banks started failing. Investors had everything for sale. Gold crashed, because people needed dollars not gold nuggets. 
Bitcoin cannot do both be perfect in Dollar Deflation and Perfect in Dollar inflation, its contradictory.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:02:32
1. ) Cheap is relative, when you need to raise cash all assets are on the table see circa 2008
2.) Gold fell because holdings were liquidated.  Gold is not a good deflation asset, you cant by groceries with gold, or bitcoin, and you pay your tax bills with it.
3.) see point 1
4.) Bitcoin was designed for the runaway inflation that is supposed to come about. But has not instead we have had continued modest inflation/deflation because we are in a liquidity trap.  Debts are denominated in dollars and must be paid back in dollars so long as this system exists, all other assets are subordinate.  If and when the world decides to do a dollar exit, then maybe bitcion will be an answer until then, we continue to see periods of modest inflation, with periods of deflation/recession.  Even today at this moment, people want U.S. Dollars as evidence by the strengthening in the last few months.

I don't believe Bitcoin can ever replace gold but it can capture a chunk of it. Unless we have a successful period of global stabilization and civilization expansion, in which our infrastructure will support this currency for millennial, if that's the case then any currency will do so we are talking a stable civilization. 
If we don't have such infrastructure then people will probably fall back on gold, which works even in a dark ages scenario.

LocalBitcoins.com crack down is coming in USA.  People are so naive about what is actually transacting, and this reminds of the NAPSTER / Bitorrent DMCA battle all over again where some kids Mom got a copyright demand because he's sharing Metallica Album.

The Feds were clear in March if you sell or buy bitcoins more than 5 times in a year you are an MSB. You need to be registered at the Federal Level and at the State level. 
Also, there is no reporting threshold, it doesn't matter if you only buy $10.00 worth.  But if you if  are moving 5 figures worth of Bitcoins you will fall on someone's radar at some point.

Ask yourself, would company A accept Japanese YEN in cash for the transaction, on a cash Basis without knowing me and ship to an address they cannot verify if it belongs to me.  
Unfortunately this seems like a grey area still. And FINCEN ruling shows their lack of understanding of how Bitcoins and Cryptocurrencies function.
