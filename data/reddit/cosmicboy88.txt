coinabul.com  buy gold and sell for cash. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 19:25:28
There's also desktop wallets like electrum that do not require you to download the entire blockchain.

Cool..that marine phytoplankton is absolutely amazing and I'd be psyched to be able to buy with btc. When I click add to cart it does not add to cart though....using chrome...

For large sums if you want to keep it off the books, turn into gold (coinabul.com) and sell the gold for cash locally. Works great.

What happens is instead of going to your bitcoin address the funds go into your btc-e account. Then you login there, buy bitcoins with it and then withdraw them to your bitcoin account. It's really pretty easy. However most exchanges have a withdrawal limit unless you verify your ID so you'll want to check that if it might be an issue. If it's just a coupe hundred bucks you should be fine.

I am running a btc based business and find it unnerving to think about how easy it would be for employees to embezzle money. Small amounts could be siphoned off pretty easily without notice.  So far I have no employees but that will change soon so I am hoping to get trusted friends on board. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:48:09
Thanks for the replies...So no withdrawal limits or ID requests?
@_date: 2013-03-08 15:27:50
Definitely use walmart...much less hassle. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 14:10:23
I would get bitcoins into bitstamp anonymously through bitinstant. Then transfer the bitcoins to my main blockchain.info wallet. Then buy gold with it. No name needed.

I have heard too many horror stories about coinbase...

And there will never be any "real" scientific evidence until they can somehow figure out a way to make ridiculous profits from growing plants that anyone can grow or harvest wild. The medical-industrial complex controls modern health science and is very unfriendly to these plants that have been used medicinally for thousands of years. In the meantime, whatever has not been "proven" by their standards is dismissed as snake oil. Anyone who has properly used herbs would tell you of their health benefits because they are pronounced and obvious. I have found that anyone that calls it snake oil has never really used them and can make no judgement call on them without sounding like a dumbass.

Setup an offshore site at someplace like  which is in iceland. They would have a hard time shutting that site down and probably wouldn't bother trying. You can register your domain there too.
@_date: 2013-03-03 15:35:39
Find some way to attach usernames to wallets. This would make bitcoin much more user friendly. 
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:11:13
Looks good...I'd suggest putting the pricing in USD and Euro's as well..I dislike having to calculate all the time.

I am getting 502 bad gateway
@_date: 2013-01-22 02:34:33
update:  I did reinstall it and got my btc back (whew!), but really that is the second time it has happened with two computer and two different versions.  While I like the interface I question the stability. Also just a note that saying things like just grab the electrum.dat or do such and such from the command line or restoring from a seed just sounds like gibberish to a non-techie. That is the biggest hurdle to bitcoin acceptance...making it intelligible to a nontechie.

How about this: "In addition, by purchasing, you agree that you are using your own funds, from your credit/debit card, bank, or any other method of payment. "
I often have used bitinstant in the past to get paid for my work in bitcoin. That way I don't get charged for creditcard and then charged again converting to btc. It seems like it goes against your tos to have someone else make a deposit and have it deposited to my btc address. Is this true?
@_date: 2013-03-16 15:08:42
Don't expect anonymity even if they did have coinapult. From their TOS: For any order, we have the right to ask for any form of identification. This includes, but is not limited to, your billing address, phone number, photo identification of any kind, Facebook profile, scanned credit card (last four digits, expire date, and name showing), and picture of a gas/water/electric bill. These are collected as evidence, for security purposes. All information will be kept confidential. In addition, by purchasing, you agree that you are using your own funds, from your credit/debit card, bank, or any other method of payment.

Seems like a bad idea to me. What if the company goes out of business and the service goes down? All your emails will be flying into a cyber black hole. 
@_date: 2013-01-07 01:07:47
I think it goes down often....
@_date: 2013-02-20 14:59:51
Ebay would care for sure..if not now, then soon. I'd suggest starting your own online store. There are not many bitcoin stores yet....
@_date: 2013-02-28 07:40:11
Great idea
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:56:51
Well over a week at this point...still waiting for my coin....beware!
@_date: 2013-02-12 16:38:09
What are the most efficient way to, well, earn Bitcoins?
The most popular way: sell drugs on silk road. :-)
@_date: 2013-02-20 15:04:30
I agree....why use a restrictive service when there are so many other options (for now anyway). Particularly if you are laundering or otherwise doing very naughty things with all those bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-03-17 13:01:00
Will people please stop posting this ancient and misinformed article?
@_date: 2013-03-02 14:18:57
If they want to convert to another currency like USD they lose out on that end...
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:02:30
Where there is money to be made, people will find a way to do it whether above board or not.

Looking at the formulations I'd guess she knows what she's doing. Just ordered 3 bottles myself. :-)
@_date: 2013-02-22 00:33:32
Nice. My request would be to add toughbook laptops. Course not sure their popularity but I'd buy one, :-)
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:45:46
Just study bitcoin a bit and you will find your answer. All you have to read is something idiotic like this :
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again; their are 3 main users of Bitcoin
The Money cleaners/tax evaders.
Those involved in non-legal activities.
The Greedy.
And it's clear that the writer is pretty clueless about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-18 23:00:11
I am wondering why you waited the whole weekend to say anything to your customer base? All this freak-out and speculation can't be good for your business. Personally, it got me looking at other options although if you get your straight-to-bitcoin-address function working again you're still the man. Still, it would have been nice to have an idea of what was going on...
@_date: 2013-02-22 00:28:23
Actually bitinstant (when it worked) was easier because you didn't have to go back and confirm that it was paid. Any chance of implementing this? I buy a lot of bitcoins regularly and it's a pain to have to go back and do that each time. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:31:06
Just did a BOA bank deposit there for bitcoin. Fast and friendly service!
@_date: 2013-03-18 13:57:40
Plus as far as I can tell bitinstant is still having issues pushing orders through
@_date: 2013-02-27 14:57:27
That was really interesting..the only surprise for me was that more people had bought narcotics than pot with bitcoin. Really?
@_date: 2013-02-27 06:27:43
ziggap.com offers anonymous bank of america deposits.
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:32:10
Their site is back and they are taking orders but are they filling them? They still owe me $300 from a week old order and are not even answering my daily emails....fuck bitinstant

Need to get me one of them fancy pants smartphones first. soon! :-)
@_date: 2013-02-26 02:45:29
Well yeah if I did that..what I would do instead is to compile it into my main wallet and then buy gold from that. Right now my bitstamp account is under an assumed name so I just wouldn't want to get coins stuck in there at some point. I have heard that happen to many SR users using Mt Gox! 
@_date: 2013-03-17 13:03:32
Look into ziggap and cryptocurrent..similar model to bitinstant (which should be renamed bitweeks). Cash deposit and no id needed (though they can request one if there is an issue)
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:00:30
The "moral ground" is that the average person pays FAR more in taxes than what they actually get for it in daily life. So much goes to waste, graft and the military (which is far larger than what is needed to actually protect the country). If taxes were reasonable and based on what the person used it would be different. For example if you have a child that goes to public school perhaps you pay extra property tax to help fund it. As for me I had to help pay for the school with my taxes even though I never used their service (because public schools are mostly a joke)
@_date: 2013-02-16 14:21:28
There are many other wallet options besides the btc client that makes you download the whole blockchain: electrum, blockchain.info and the armory to name a few.
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:33:46
How does the p2p transfer work...if banks are involved I am guessing it is not anonymous?
@_date: 2013-03-06 00:17:22
You still have a $300+ order of mine outstanding in spite of repeated requests. The thing that is really strange though is that you are now "open for business" and taking new orders when obviously you aren't even able to fill outstanding orders. I love bitinstant overall but really I will think twice before using your service again.  
@_date: 2013-03-03 15:20:51
Nice piece of writing for a reply on reddit. :-)
I have heard the child with the paper that said that was John Lennon. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:04:27
The point I'm making is that they shouldn't be open for business and taking new orders if they can't fill the ones they have open...especially with no public explanations.
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:12:39
being able to buy bitcoins anonymously (a bitinstant competitor)
@_date: 2013-03-01 07:07:55
Great job!
