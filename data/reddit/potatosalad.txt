IIRC, there were some services that you could use your phone and SMS to send and receive. Fees were so low back then it basically wasn't a factor. I would look for the articles on this subreddit, but it was from anywhere from 3-7 years ago when I first saw it.

How long have you been in crypto? If you recall years ago, BTC was highly coveted in third world countries as it was a fast and very low-fee way to transfer money.
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:59:58


The thing is in that most cases, bar those extreme cases such as Venezuela, is that currency changes don't affect most people as it's so engrained in our daily lives. Take the dollar for example: it's been progressively weakening, but most of us don't notice since our daily lives are transacted in dollars.

You must be new to bitcoin. Mobile BTC payments used to serve developing countries and third world countries quite well.

Here's a basic rundown. Those chips on that Radeon 5830 are designed for one purpose: processing data to display that image on your screen. As a result, it's REALLY good at doing what it does. Now on this USB miner, the chips are designed to mine. So it'll be really good at that, and thus have a high hash rate.

I don't know if you saw my comment about quitting your job or not. But I truly recommend that you don't, unless you have plans to find a better one. I just don't want to see anybody making any rash decisions because of some new wealth. Best of luck.

Jesus, I remember when I was just dabbling in this a few years ago. I invested my entire tax return and 10% of my salary that year in bitcoins. A few years went by, and I completely wiped my hard drive to install windows 8. I don't even want to think about how much that's worth now.

You sound like a Jehovah's witness. But instead of pushing a religion, you're pushing anti-bank. It all depends on the bank really. Those people who are getting charged for overdrafts weren't really going to save much money anyways, so banks probably weren't for them. Much different than your situation, I'm assuming.

Fuck me, that might actually be mine. Years ago, I put my entire tax return for one year and a portion of my salary for that year into bitcoins. Forgot about it after a few months, and for windows 8, I completely wiped my hard drive. Had the biggest "Oh shit" moment a few weeks ago when one of my friends mentioned bitcoin. No luck recovering my wallet since then. :(

I doubt anybody would agree to a zero-confirmation transaction. That's why you typically see many places require a certain number of confirmations, to combat this.

The theft insurance only covers that. Theft. If someone steals a car, we have to put up with the lost profit, which isn't covered.

How many bitcoins do you have? If you invested $30,000 USD back then, you would only have around $500,000 USD now. I wouldn't quit a job over that. I've saved up somewhere in the high seven figures, and wouldn't even consider retiring now. Unless you plan to find another job, quitting your job now is one of the most foolish things you can do.

To be fair, I wouldn't even consider investing in something like this in a financial firm. With currencies, the currency is backed up, in a way, by the economy of that country. With bitcoins, there's not much of an economy right now. It's more gambling, than investing. While I would risk my own money over it, I wouldn't risk someone else's money.
That said, your coworkers need to be more open-minded, for when bitcoins have a more established economy.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:08:47
Okay let's do some simple math here. After the first month, 58 bitcoins will remain that need to be recouped. (75-17=58, in case you didn't follow. And assuming that the difficulty doubles in a month AND it wouldn't only be 8 BTC a month, 75 bitcoins would be completely recouped after 9 months. Besides, many of us have thousands of bitcoins, as a result, 75 bitcoins isn't that much.
@_date: 2013-07-21 18:35:16
Maybe they need a website that isn't totally childish and immature.
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:38:39
I'm sorry, but I don't see this happening. Unless someone can reliably pay for everything with bitcoins, it won't happen. There's a reason the population in each country uses it's fiat. However, I can see this working with little jobs here and there, both online and offline. I could see an mTurk-like system working with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:21:01
Well, first of all, not using an arduino for something like this. When using something like an arduino, you need to be conscientious of the limitations of the hardware. With that, an arduino is not something to be using for this. That being said, it's great that you got a proof-of-concept working with the limited hardware that you have.

@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:21
Honestly, you should read up a bit about bitcoin. Without going into too much technical detail, with the double spending, the alternate chain would not be confirmed by any other nodes; only the earliest transaction would go through. However, if you control more than 50% of the network, you might have a chance of this succeeding.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:32:46
This isn't crowdfunding with bitcoins. It's crowdfunding with USD with the ability to pay in bitcoins. Also, what's stopping someone from starting a project, collecting as many bitcoins as possible, and then running off? There needs to be a pledge system.

Wow, you mean the most economically developed country in has companies accepting bitcoins? Shocker.
@_date: 2013-05-16 08:59:54
Most of them aren't money transmitters, per se. They're just markets for users to trade between fiat and bitcoins, so they aren't transferring any money themselves.
