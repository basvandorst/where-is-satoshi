Good answer. I was aware of the other three but [Discreet Log Contracts.]( is a new one for me.

Don't lend out your BTC. If they follow the same proceedure as they did during the Ethereum fork they will steal your Bitcoin Unlimited if you lend out BTC prior to the fork.

The price of bitcoin is above $1000. It is ok for alts to rise too. All that has happened is that the market cap of crypto in general has increased.  Be happy this is not a zero sum game.

Your reply has nothing to do with my message. Are you a bot?

That may well be the case. However for comparison I refer you to your [own posting history]( to make a judgement about yourself.

Read Vitalik's post above. Check the ETC balance on Gas Tracker. Then stop blatantly lying.

It doesn't take 120 million. Two dev's managed to create and API micropayment system on Ethereum in 48 hours ( over a year ago. Of course nobody uses either eth APIs or 21.co's APIs.

That is they sold ETC

You are missing the point, the information is already public. Even if it were not and shapeshift did not release information both BTC &amp; ETH are public ledgers so you could do timing &amp; amount correlation (i.e just look at BTC sent to shapeshift just before the Eth account was funded) to determine where the funds came from (it is about 10 minutes of work on the chain explorers).

DAO =Dead on arrival.

They are launching the **ginger test net** in 8 days. They plan to launch the the *main net* some time afterwards. (One month later at the earliest.)
