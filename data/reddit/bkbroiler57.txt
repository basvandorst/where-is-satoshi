Also day traders and limit sells and such... all at the speed of light. My biggest fear is that the Tards will all panic at the same time like roaches with the lights turned on and send us all back to 2010.

Traditionally you must stake this claim on the consumption of a part of one of your sexual organs.

Does it surprise you that coinbase is a bunch of ass spelunking corn holers? So transferring out as soon as I get back in the country.

Consider yourself climbing out of a valley between two mountains... which path you take is proportional to the ease at which the market price would also take

Don’t use that site for forecasting price. Find yourself a good candlestick graph that’s already interpreted for you.

Yes... this... 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:37:17
No, bittrex uses simple math, candlestick is statistics ... both of which don’t necessarily work bc past performance isn’t a predictor of future performance but short term the candlesticks are a pretty good indicator imo
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:23:28
Started on the left of that argument... edging to the right... a dreamer can dream.

Nobody else gonna point out the corollary to the man who was chatting about stocks to his shoe shine boy prior to the Great Depression and decided right there to pull out? ... it’s somewhat disturbing  to me ...

Now press the horn ... slowly.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:18:20
Exactly... if I see you without it.. All your btc are forfeit to me

If 10k is the moon... next step is mars, then Jupiter, then Uranus then Neptune then Pluto then alpha centarie  then freaking andromeda ... really there is no shortage of astronomical bodies 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:18:35
look at a few but this one is pretty informative as it tells you what the patterns are and how reliable they are at prediction and timelines... granted it’s just a slightly cooler crystal ball and btc loves to only follow those trends for about an hour :-p
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:38:10
Will need key to verify. ;)

Kids are out there eating tide pods to the point that is made international news... yes most people are too stupid for most things. Just think how dumb the average person is... then Realize that half of them are even dumber.

Had to sodl at my cost bias just now ... hopefully I can time it right to plunge once more into the breach.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:40:16
Both... but I did the bank transfer  and not direct buy so I fucked myself
