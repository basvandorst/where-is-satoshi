Why are you posting a 2 day old story? Its going to give people heart attacks because they'll think its dropping again.

Yet your advising people to get out now after a 4% drop?

And another dump.

If your starting small I think a software wallet is OK, one thing I've been advised is do not keep your coins on the exchange. other than that only invest what you can afford to lose. but the sidebar has tonnes of info I'm sure if you have specific questions the gurus here can help you!

Perhaps, and your only trying to stop people from losing money so good on you. Some of us are small players atm so a 4% downturn means relatively little to us. PS sorry I think might have caused the crash as I just invested for the first time in BTC yesterday.

Wow! Thank you for the great explanation, I've downloaded bitcoin core I'll xfer my btc as soon as I've synced the blockchain.

I'm still new myself so I was using my exchanges online wallet but I'm swapping over to bitcoin core as soon as possible I don't know if its the best but at least its under my control and easy to setup.
Edit* [This]( page remommends a [Multisignature]( Wallet so that might be a good place to start.

I'm new to BTC and trading in general can I ask why its not safe to keep them on the exchange? I'm guessing its in case its hacked?
