You'll know Bitcoin has made it when governments no longer auction them off, retaining them instead.
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:33:37
It looks like you've got it all worked out. I guess we're fucked and Bitcoin is going to fail.
I'm selling it all and moving to Idaho. If you want to transact with me in the future, I will only barter. I accept pigs, goats, potable water, tin-foil hats, and signed photos of G. Gordon Liddy. Everything else is controlled by the government (and the cameras at the mall).
I was an idiot to believe in Bitcoin. All you fuckers are doomed.

Sidechains will make it programmable. No need to mess with core.
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:40:56
Why are people not paying more attention to sidechains and flexcap? We need to leave core alone, and allow innovators to build on top of a stable, consistent platform.
When cars were invented, the engineers didn't try to figure out a way to build gas pumps in the dash boards. The market will take care of innovation.

The day the government bans Bitcoin will be the day every media outlet on earth ensures that anyone who hasn't yet heard of Bitcoin will know all about it.
It will be the best publicity we could ever hope for. They can't win.

Blockchain analysis is worth nothing if coins cannot be associated with a particular actor. No amount of collaboration or "alliance" will change that.
The thing that will save Bitcoin (if it can be saved) will be core or third-party solutions that mix so thoroughly that obfuscation is unbeatable.
We've known this from the beginning. The thing that surprises me is that developers aren't more focused on completing this task. It's blindingly obvious, and yet projects like CoinJoin and Dark Wallet are dead.
I have applied my efforts to open source solutions to this problem. I might humbly suggest that other devs -- instead of creating the next greatest Android wallet -- turn their talents towards creating the universal anonymity solutions that hang temptingly right before us.
Once mixing becomes (nearly) free and as easy as clicking a button, there will be no more effective "blockchain analysis;" plausible deniability will make it an expensive and futile endeavor. And at that point, the Blockchain Alliance will become an embarrassing gaggle of petulant sycophants scrambling over one another to be the first to deny any "real" association with it in the first place.
Actually, they're already an embarrassing gaggle of petulant sycophants. Our job is to initiate the "scrambling" part.
Let's get to work.

It's a good thing you prefaced your injection with a hearty "lol." That certainly makes for a stronger argument.
But I see what you're saying. Using multiple strong passwords is clearly unsafe.
@_date: 2015-11-17 11:57:54
Hardware wallets aren't distributable, and they eliminate plausible deniability.
@_date: 2015-11-17 13:25:31
Why can't you keep the bulk of your wealth hidden in deep, secure containers, while keeping "spending money" in an easily accessed wallet?
I knew there'd be resistance (this is after all). But are you people really that unimaginative?
@_date: 2015-11-17 19:10:01
Enlighten me please. How do you distribute a hardware wallet -- so that it's available in multiple places, thousands of miles away?
Further, please, please tell me how you have plausible deniability when an FBI is standing in front of you, in your house, holding your hardware wallet? How, exactly, does that work? What do you tell them? Is it a garage door opener? Or maybe it's your mother-in-law's?
Or maybe... "I have no idea where that came from. You planted it."
That will probably work.

Side chains will facilitate innovation. Leave core frozen.
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:02:17
This is the absolute best path.
@_date: 2015-11-15 13:38:15
This could mean the end of Bitcoin (although I doubt it). But if it should lead to that outcome, then Bitcoin merely becomes the proverbial "Napster." The technologies that replace it will unequivocally foil these complex, costly, and ultimately ineffective attempts to control (near) instantaneous, (near) costless, decentralized, anonymous asset transfer.
Don't panic. No matter what happens, federal bureaucracies lose.
Oh, and Gavin, what the fuck?

"Too secure."
Oh my God...

Tor doesn't prevent a server from seeing all the addresses being used in a wallet (if you're using Electrum). So if that adversary can prove one of the addresses is yours, he can prove all of them are.Tor won't change that.
I'm surprised the community doesn't see this as more of a problem. BTW, I know someone is going to mention Bloom filters. Those don't work either.

This isn't really aimed at your mother-in-law. It's aimed at people who want to protect wealth from taxes (among other things). It's also for people who want to create long-term financial strategies with their wealth.
Your mother-in-law is probably fine with a bank account and a financial adviser. But whether you want to admit it or not, there are millions of people out there who actively take control of their finances and investments. This is especially true of people in jurisdictions that criminalize a lot of activity that shouldn't be criminalized.
Your mother-in-law will be fine with a Trezor. Many of us, however, need much more than that. As such, you might want to re-read the subject of the post.
Now I'm not one of these people, of course. I'm just referring "some people." I want to clarify that. Because I would never break any law, in any jurisdiction, of any sort. Ever.
