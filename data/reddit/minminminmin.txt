Loans are not income, so they are not taxed. You put down your crypto as collateral and they issue you are loan. It's just like selling your crypto and getting USD, except in name. The interest is paid with the Salt token and it is actually a tax deductible expenditure.

If you don't want to pay taxes on crypto gains, then use the SALT platform.

2x world gold market cap on January 1st 2021. I bet 1 reddit gold against anyone who denies this. So $425,000 per bitcoin. I better see some shiny when I'm right bitches.

I bet it will rise to 3800 and crash to 2800 in the next week. Any takers?

It's the same thing, please use whichever one you want.

First, lets be clear, Network value is just a word used to make Market Cap sound more academic. 
NVT means Marketcap divided by the Volume of transactions excluding those made for the purpose of trading, ie. coinbase, kraken, exchanges. The idea is to see how much bitcoins are actually used for it's intended purpose compared to how much people are just speculating in it. 
The idea is this, "When everyone is buying tulips and noone is admiring them, you have a tulip bubble."
Okay I just made up that analogy and it sucks, but I posted it and here it is anyway.

I just checked out the modlogs subs. I don't understand where they get the data from. If it's published by reddit, it really defeats the purpose, right?

Well, that pretty much sums it up for me. Thanks.

I guess I could rephrase my question as: "Does it matter what the general public thinks about bitcoin?"

No, it only adds more weight and therefore momentum and therefore he needs to counter more inertia with his legs. It should be intuitive if you imagine him carrying a heavy rock.
