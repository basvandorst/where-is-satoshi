That's what I'm saying. This was written when the concept was being formed and much more vulnerable to being shut down.

I don't want to state anything too specific so I'll browse again to get myself reacquainted, but for now the Google review said:
 " ... the story of freedom-seekers who create an alternative society on the Internet -- a virtual society, with no possibility of oversight or control. It grows so fast that governments and "leaders" are terrified, and fight to co-opt this cyber-society before it undermines the power of the governing elite."--Cover [p. 4].

Have you read to the ending? If so, what did you think about how it ended?
@_date: 2015-12-06 06:23:59
Ya, its long. From what I remember its tells of a group of intellectuals being harbored by wealthy individuals around the world. It involves topis that include being chased by authorities, internet encryption, etc.
Sorry I can't be more specific, it is a long read...

Banks are already primarily real estate firms. The majority of their balance sheet is usually mortgage debt backed by a fraction of deposits on hand (fractional reserve system). Each bank's lending policy is custom to that Bank, but in Canada their lending policy will require borrowers to qualify for a loan; ie. borrowers must contribute, and therefore risk losing, the top 5-20% in cash for any personal mortgage, or 15-50% in cash-flow or value (based on net operating income) for a qualifying commercial mortgage, before the Bank's capital is at risk. What I imply is that: this is sound business practice for mitigating risk that Bank's used to exclusively control, and bitcoin now offer an alternative to.Regardless, the Bank's will likely survive and reuse their lending policy no matter whether fiat/crypto denominated transactions.
I agree the bank's have A+ real estate holdings on their books, but a majority of their risk is the arguably "over-leveraged" debt due to the lending policy allowed by their Central Bank's, not from bleeding from their branch operations. **The problem bank's face, is that if interest rates increase, this may cause a negative effect on market values (Effectively: market value = annual income / market cap (%)), sales transaction volumes will slow, owners not being able to make payments at increased interest rates (based on historic market values) will be forced to sell at a loss to avoid ongoing increased interest payments, the borrowers may walk away from the mortgage if they have no equity left in the asset (Ie. more debt than market value) and this concept will domino to the point where there is a major problem with almost eveyrthing (market revaluation of cash - think Dirty 30's). I suspect the proportions of borrowers that could afford an interest rate increase vs. the proportion of borrowers who would be severely negatively impacted (and cause a domino-like 'tipping point') is the factor at the heart of this problem.**
The bank's staff is a discretionary expense at the end of the day, which can be modernized over time to be less expensive. This is actually already happening, with their fixed costs Ie. typical Bank footprints shrinking from ~6,000 sq. ft. to now preferring about ~3-4,000 sq. ft. and drive-thru ATM's.
I suspect that Banks will strategically evolve their business services, organization structure (Ie. REIT's, etc) to best use their whatever they control to maximize their value with the changing times. In my mind, this will likely include crypto-currency (Bitcoin), especially if it can be leveraged.
Bank's won't give up their control which is currently strategically structured behind fiat currency. Bank's and large multinational corporations, if they aren't already, may actively cooperate (or maybe compete) to marginalize any growth to be had in any 'asset class' unless it is to their best interest. That's just called strategy in our current world.
Interesting times.

The reason people are holding BTC (and price is therefore increasing) I would argue is because of its inherent value (as a unit to store AND transfer of value), which is now being realized as a useful modern tool.

Google "Bank of canada, Bitcoin". The BOC have completed several reports on Bitcoin. I recently talked with one of the BOC Directors (who focus on administration of the BOC, rather than policy) and asked him about Bitcoin, he admitted he knew little but directed me to research those reports.

my understanding is that bonds are for entities who have too much money to use (i know, rough life) and they accept the negative bond because that's the best the market is offering. These are investments which are guaranteed by either credit worthy business or governments. These entities have a good  covenant (does what they say, rather than default, etc...) when compared to smaller businesses or the average individual. Bonds are typically more liquid that other investments like businesses and less volatile than commodities. Just a shot in the dark...

See what says below. It's either costly to hold cash yourself (storage, security,  administration, etc. ) or you run the risk of the bank or banks going broke while holding your cash. We are sheltered from the reality of how much of a risk that is if all companies put their "spare" cash into banks.
