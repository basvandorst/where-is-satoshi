Which would be very easy to trade for cash

Youre on a post that I found from labeling him a martyr

But why are you hung up on charges that were droppped i.e. are not relevant to the case
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:48:55
And yet apparently a very important part of the discussion. Them being dropped is why I barely mentioned them. Theyre barely relevant in a quick overview which is what I was trying to accomplish
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:37:15
Its only in more than dollars if you let it be. Blaming drugs or drug dealers for addiction is just stupid

Did you read the last sentence? I tried to avoid controversial details. Personally i believe that it was DPR who ordered the hit but I believe that he was probably also swindled and nobody really died and if they died idrc as they were clearly players trying to use snitching as a tactic for advancement which is absolutely unnaceptable for an international drug dealer. If they did get killed, they got what was coming to them
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:50:03
What exactly did you think I meant by the last sentence?
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:33:41
I didnt really try to make my opinions clear initially because I wasnt expecting anyone to reply with questions
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:16:37
Maybe the people you know and love should have exhibited more self control
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:04:04
Duh. What are you trying to say?
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:42:14
I literally said he tried to pay for a murder in the last sentence

Ross Ulbricht ran SilkRoad, a way to buy drugs over the internet. The feds were like "whoa this shit is crazy people are doing drugs must be a foreigner" but then it turned out he was just some dude in SF who liked getting high so they made an example out of him up by giving him 2 consecutive life sentences for running the shit. Some federal agents were also caught stealing a ton of money from SilkRoad's case and Ulbricht allegedly paid for a guy's death who was threatening him 
Edit: im not sure why this is being taken so seriously. Im sorry I didnt bring out a full bibliography for this short summary. If you want more information or disagree then research it and write a summary yourself. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:08:01
Sure you could argue that but I was referring to the "code" of sorts that says that career criminals dont go to cops
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:08:24
Because he wanted a short summary not a discussion
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:44:22
Were they not shocked he was an American?
Did he not just operate the site?
Did they not make an example of him?
Sure, Im biased I admit it I hate the government but those are the facts of the case.

Cus being raped is the same as choosing to repeatedly get high on opiates without breaks or anything? Ive done a whole bunch of oxy in my time bud and let me tell you, people dont transition from Oxy to Heroin by accident. Everyone knows when theyre doing too much. Everyone knows when theyre developing a tolerance. Everyone knows the first time theyre dope sick. The people who get addicted to heroin are the ones who dont put the shit down and walk away when they see these signs thats called self control.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:41:21
I didnt say that in my original statement 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:02:45
I was trying to avoid the ethics argument and armchair lawyers. Yes I think he should do murder time for ordering a murder
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:30:52
It was all very exciting at the time now it just feels kind of shitty with the way it was handled but its like fuck it what are you gonna do imo. Ulbricht will die in jail for sure. SilkRoad has been replaced by numerous clones, many of which have arrived with new feaures and such to draw in even more customers. All this shitstorm did was advertise that it's possible to get cheap drugs online 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:06:36
When I say DPR I am referring to Ulbricht. Im not trying to say he's innocent but I do think the state tried to make him an example and accidentally made a martyr
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:33:37
There is a discussion like how they never recovered a body leading to the conclusion that Ross was swindled or set up and while he may have intended to he did not have anyone killed
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:47:45
Can confirm
