Actually took me a while because I built the backend on an experimental framework ironically called Perfect. Server-side Swift. Spent a long time on the UI too

edit: within an hours period

Yeah, would need to create something more advanced on the backend to pick up short term jumps, but main idea was general awareness without being glued to the charts. Hope you like it if you download!

None taken, but my app is more like an alarm clock. It continues to notify until disabled or snoozed. He also likely using the exchange api’s 24 hour change, where this calculate a percentage change off a recorded price point every hourly. This means you only get alerts when the price makes a major move within an hour period.

I'm not 16 and I have server fees buddy. If I could make it less than 99 cents and more than $0. Nothing is free.

I asked if they charge a fee for following them on twitter— surprisingly no fee.

Could you explain further?

So most of the mining is just processing “fake transactions”? Transaction from me to other me?

Comparing the new to the old? New system should be better, but I don't understand the technology enough to say how.
Let's say there are 100,000 machines mining at full force and 90,000 decide to shutdown. What threshold keeps the system running, processing transactions? Or is it the more miners the shorter processing time?
