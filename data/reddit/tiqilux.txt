Crash coming soon. When futures market opens &gt; China will bet big on bitcoin price dropping, then sells all their bitcoin &gt; earns shit ton of money &gt; then price plummets &gt; earns shit tons of money on futures bet that price will plummet &gt; bets on bitcoin going up &gt;

Yes, if buying the house has bigger value for them in the moment than earning extra money. If they achieved their objective.  
There is much more to life than earning money, a lot of people could go study something to earn more money, or go do some sales that they won't, because it's not how their motivation works. Everybody has some psychological profile and situation in life. If you have a nagging wife that wants the house because her family has conditioned her that is the thing to do. Buying that house will make you much happier next year than that money. Just my 2 cents.

Gold that is used is different case, that gold is sold for its price and build into your computer - that adds in price you pay. That is ok and has nothing to do in comparison with bitcoin.  
But how about gold that costs more than btc to mine, destroys the environment, and is put into a brick that is put into a safe for 30 years. Until it is put into another safe. How about that ? Nobody use that to produce something.

Bitcoin is a bank, Layer 2 will be a visa. The end. You can build payment system on top of the value storage, you cannot do the opposite.

As we do for hundreds of years. How about companies, countries, patents - they are all a product of our "imagination". Very few things have a price based on mass or physicality. Even if they do, most of the price is made by perceived value (marketing, ideals, emotions).  
And it is a good thing too. The best description of this is in the book Sapiens if you are interested.

Real believer here, got more money I want to put into bitcoin longterm. Need help ... buy now?  
A big correction was expected but I think not so many people came just for the split. I think most people were waiting until after the split to buy long term (institutions and even some normal people I know). Now they will start to buy slowly and bitcoin might go up towards 20 000 for sure if the numbers of new investors and organizations are right. There might be no significant correction until 30 000 guys (meaning more than 35%).  
What do you think? Let's discuss.

**Crazy idea but would like a feedback**  
Do you think there will be taxes like now in future? How about paying for services directly. Each and every service the government provides.  
 Travelling on a road? Paid for it. Using fireman, army anything? Paid for it in real time - with smart contracts blockchain taking money from my account of some sort. Driving lambo vs. honda? You pay more for each km. Bigger house? Pay more on the daily basis with microtransactions. You get the point.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:41:59
They won't, what is easier will always win. If all governments ban it its game over.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:44:33
or doesn't 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:39:54
You can´t trade it for goods and services if it's banned by the government. Every business transaction is controlled because of taxes, so if they ban it, bitcoin goes down to maybe 100 or less.  
We have seen how much was bitcoin valuable when it was used only in shadow.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:34:30
**Bitcoin is more inherently valuable than gold by far!**  
In 100 years we will mine asteroids. There will be an unlimited amount of gold, aluminium or silver, so we will need to find out something else to use as a value language - to communicate value - to use as a ledger. Bitcoin (or something similar that will replace it) is that technology.  
You will be able to manipulate everything, fake news, fake videos, fake vr reality, you will be able to 3D print every object and duplicate and change every bit of information, except decentralized databaze - that will be the most valuable real thing in a fake fake world.    
Funny how people think gold is valuable as a store of value because it can be used in some industry. False, it just had all the right attributes at the right time, now that is changed.  
In future people will not understand how we could communicate the value of business friendship or hours worked for somebody in metal the same way we don't understand sea shells used for payments in the past.  
I also might be wrong, but this seems to be the case so far, prove me otherwise.

This.  
People need to realize that they should behave based on actual data, not beliefs. The price is the price, that's it. Most big money has better analytics, better decisionmaking than you, and currently, big money is out.  
The point is they know why. Based on usage, network growing, everything that is happening - the price is going down. That's because bitcoin is not performing as it was thought it will be. I hope it will go back, holding some but will not buy more until I will see some movement in the zeitgeist.

Found interesting comment on zerohedge from Anopheles that struck me:


They only get the cash when there are infusions of NEW cash to pay your withdrawl. They are exchanges, not banks!*  
**They hold no assets!**
*Try* **withdrawing  10 million from an exchange**, *when you haven't deposited any cash or just a tiny bit of cash into that exchange.   What do you think they are going to tell you?  That they'll transfer it all immediately?  Hahahhahaha
What part of* **NO CASH RESERVES** *and NO ASSETS in the SYSTEM don't you understand?"*

Kinda like ICOs today, in internet bubble investors lost money, today it will be ordinary people that is the difference. If investors with teams of advisors couldn't be sure, how can we be. There will be few winners here, but generally, we know blockchain will be huge, but not if the valuations are right.

Lets compare our thoughts here, would you guys advise buying more now or wait ?
Mid-term thinking I am not a day-trader so since the price should rise till the end of the year I am thinking there is no need to wait for bigger dip.

I don't believe that HOLDING (that's how you spell it ) bitcoin is about believing in technology - you are totally in it for the money - hoping you sell in years and earn 1000x. 
Believing in technology means getting your business take bitcoins, using bitcoins for transactions, spreading the infrastructure and so on. Using bitcoin is the opposite of holding it.  Just Holding it is waiting to earn some money. 
I hear no talk here about how to help with mass adoption, how you are trying to pay your vendors and clients in bitcoin etc. 
Also why does he care as ETH holder ? Well everything is connected here keep that in mind.

All currencies are languages. The language of value exchange, they were here before spoken and written language. More animals can learn the language of money, like dolphins or monkeys so it is really universal.  
First 2 things that happen when you teach money to monkeys are:  
1) robberies - animals start to steal tokens you taught them they can exchange for food.  
2) females start to offer sex for money  
  
  
So for many years we used different things to communicate value, now there is new language that is better and far more useful and fair - its called bitcoin.

You want to bypass payment via the third party.

So sure it is great place to keep things safe

Diamonds are not valuable. They are controlled by monopoly look that up. It is mostly marketing.  
 
  
Gold is not valuable as well, silver is the same. Not valuable I mean not as much as it trades for. Sure, you use it for technology atc. but if that was all we use it for, the price would be much lower.  
  
  
Gold, dollars etc. are valuable because we use them as a language. The language of value, one that you can teach to dolphins and monkeys, the universal language of exchange of value. There are many things you can use as this language, many were forgotten, many new will come.  
In 50 - 100 years we start to mine asteroids, comets, there will be so much gold and silver that we will not know what to do with it.  
This will be the time when bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency will be most valuable thing you can own. Think about that, learn about it, there is many sources.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:32:22
This time it is different. For example just this: "The elephant in the room is what many see as Bitcoin's core value proposition, the supply limit of 21 million coins.  This limit is often advertised as being inviolable because it is mathematically enforced, but that is only true as long as everyone is running the code that enforces that limit.  The 21-million coin limit is enforced by exactly the same mechanism that currently enforces the block size limit.  If the one can change, so can the other." Big shift in thinking about bitcoin is possible, than there will be new king on the block, possibly all altcoins valued to dollar or eth
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:53:59
Bitcoin will not be the currency of the future. You need regulatory oversight from goverment. Technology will be used in the future. But look how easy it is to create blockchain coin, everybody has one by now, goverments will surely create their own that simplify taxes collection and oversight - that might be the currency of the future. 
It is really simple to destroy bitcoin once it will become too big.
Think about this - bitcoin is overvalued right now - it is really not worth 4000, the price is this high because people believe that 10 years from now, price will be much higher + you will be able to use bitcoin to pay for everything. Both assumptions might be wrong:
- If countries decide to ban bitcoin for business payments and forbid banks to accept fiat from exchanges it is game over - bitcoin will be unusable as payment method - and this means no mass adoption - price will fall, miners will move onto new, goverment backed currencies and bitcoin will be forgotten.
Thoughts on this ?

Just a beginning, you are not seeing the log curve. People will use it to pay for a car when 100K. Volatility will be very minimal - smaller than dollar then, because of mathematics, electricity and other rules.

@_date: 2017-10-12 20:40:31
Volatility will drop with greater adoption. When bitcoin will be around 20K there is going to be far lower volatility, then around 100K it's going to be really small.  
Bitcoin will never be used as currency, it will be digital gold, benchmark, used for huge transactions, store of value and different systems connected to bitcoins will be used for day to day use.
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:28:02
