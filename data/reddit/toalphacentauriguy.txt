So much for proof

No, and neither do the BCH devs. But it is good for NOW.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:54:17
Im selling access to my lightning network hubs. There are lots of haters, so it's a great time to get in cheap, pm me if you want a year membership for only $100 in btc. That's only 2 transaction fees for a year of payments!
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:06:58
Because someone you don't like has an idea, you have to go against it. Hope they don't breathe air or drink water.

The bitcoin i held in 2013 are still there in my bch wallet.

I think they're on to us, hee come the downvote bots. Lol. They had previously downvoted the ones who called this a trick. Lmao
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:08:04
So much work to contain the troof. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:06:25
Who mines both bitcoins now?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:01:51
You're working with feelings. Im working with  numbers,eg. high transaction fees, full blocks, and the doom and gloom the core team pushed on a hard fork has been proved to be bullshit with a functional bitcoin cash. I don't give a damn what Roger Ver does. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:58:13
It is Bitcoin as Satoshi intended.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:36:30
Your own group downvoted you because they want to believe. Why can't you believe too?
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:54:50
Oh boy, it's coming. You should hold your breath until it does.

Why not laugh, like when detractors like prof. Bitcorn went off? Oh we're scared of some truth? Is bitcoin not the honey badger anymore? Or is the real honeybadger bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:47:08
A version of bitcoin that works, confirms fast, has low fees, has increasing merchant adoption, and is the bitcoin i fell in love with 5 years ago? Color me shit coined. I guess i should buy the coin that does the opposite of that because noobs and grandmas are pumping the price.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:01:55
Lmao. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:13:45
How? A trip to best buy's hard drive aisle will tell you it won't be a big deal. But yeah, stomp on all the people that actually made Bitcoin a success in the first place. Keep believing banks are your friends and will use Bitcoin. It's like Ford buying out the trollycar companies.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:12:30

Meanwhile the poor cant even transact in btc. Nice using the poor only when it benefits your narrative.

There is more to crypto, if the founding layer made of transactions and fluidity work, take that away, you have a sandcastle.

You say this while uttering the name Bcash... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:41
We're still getting attacked. Core is setting up obviously shitty forks to water down Bitcoin Cash. (Bitcoin Cash Plus)? Us keeping newbies from spending their first $100 on a currency that will cost $20 in fees after buying and selling is doing crypto a favor.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:36
I tried getting friends to buy bitcoin. They cam with ten dollars each.  I took it all and said it didnt even cover transaction costs. 
I wonder why new people aren't jumping on
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:45:57
Thats why they are here and not the real bitcoin sub

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:42:32
The reasons i bought bitcoin in 2013 were: 
low transaction fees for merchants
fast confirm times, 
Uncensored development discussion 
I see that community alive and well... in Bcash
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:27:10

It allows an in-kind transaction when jumping out of crypto in case of a bear market. Which allows you to jump right back on without experiencing a taxable event.

....sorry, that 2% lending rate was too good to pass up
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:01:15
Triads want more than 0% interest over 3-5 years. Also...how will you cash out? The gox crash alone crashed the price 90%

Delicate. Like when you post your emo pics of your breakup cards. This sub is the crypto version of the_doofus, with your boycott of..... everything..
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:31:15
That's the joke. Bitcoin has become no better.

I've never seen someone do a double spend like Jackie!

They have been honchos from the start. I don't get this unreasonable hate for them.

Enjoy your hobbyist $45 price per coin then.

This attitude is why we have splits

Skew narratives... what about skewing whitepapers?

They are not interchangeable or even equivalent in value

Wow. Now tell me about how the US housing market will never go down.

So.. if you're paying.... what's the fucking problem?

Don't debate because he'll lose?
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:27:52
What does that have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:40:55
Meanwhile, they have a version of medium and Twitter working with Bitcoin Cash, and we're laughing at them because micro-transactions are for poor big blockers
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:52:15
Thanks for that link. Gonna make an episode of it on my Adventures in Bitcoin series
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:14:08
That was silk road tho wasn't it?
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:02:15
The cause is the solution to this problem!
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:45:45
You mean xmr?
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:52:32
He invented Bitcoin tho, Hazcash with inflation control.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:37:16
He still wouldn't have done it. He's not a tech guy.

Does bitrex use margin?
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:53:57
NPR is about 9% federally funded. Not much influence on what they do.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:52:19
Everyone 
1. Doesn't know about this
2. Is making more money going leveraged on btc, eth
3. Doesn't like parking money on exchanges
This results in high returns to attract funding. Keep it down. I like these rates to stay the same.
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:58:14
Has my Eth held up, but waited it out and got it 4 days later. Polo just has a backlog. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:33:00
He played too dumb. "I have no contact with this Bitcoins..."
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:09:31
Buffet doesn't buy what he doesn't understand. He owns no tech stocks. He never even considered buying amazon stock. He is what he is.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:29:58
There is always namecoin

After 7 years of this shit.... no. YOU hold the bag.

Poloniex was hacked the year before bitfinex. It happens. They just up their security after, if they survive. Which polo and finex both did.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:14:53
Or like in the past. Eat ramen for the next 3 years. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:49:43
It's limited supply that is causing it. Why would I lend you btc when I could buy some dank eth or dash and make some sweet returns? The high rates bring in lenders, if we're in times where easier money can be made with alts, the btc lending rate rises to compete.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:45:17
There is a strong demand to short BTC. This is healthy and keeps the price from getting too high. Seeing as how there is limited options to do so, places that do offer margin see an increase in rates to meet demand. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:36:20
I'm trying to sort through the schadenfreude to see whether it is really an issue or just fans of one side making a huge issue out of a minor thing from the other side.

It's Szabo. When Craig tried to hint he was Satoshi at that conference, look at  Szabo's face....

You're in the statist state of mind. Oh I can make money? I should ask the government for permission to participate in free markets.

Keep listening to the optimists. Or keep what money you have and sell. Rebuy at 50%
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:52:25
I like Gavin. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:23:24
His entire investing strategy would change. Would Buffet even be Buffet if he did?

Posting with some humility might help. But I'm just an alien.
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:06:27
So you weren't all in before? Is anyone here full Bitcoin? Because when the shit drops, I don't have any more money to buy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:18:07
Wait 3 years like the OGs here did.
