If bitcoins rise in price and usage, each block could be worth more than they are now.

Good luck with your little project. I bought a year of hosting for a couple of bitcoins. Let me know what you buy with your currency, k?

As of this moment, they're 10.68 times less worthless than the dollar.

We can cut the salary and benefits of senators and congressmen.

You do that. Let me know how it works for you. In the meantime, my bitcoins have almost tripled in value in the past month.

That would depend on one's definition of success, I suppose.

And the price is dropping. I'll be selling mine also.

I can see the TV ads in 2012 when some marketing fuck pitches this on TV to the still-on-AOL/MSN crowd:
"You've read about them! You've heard about them! Buy into the amazing world of bitcoins today! For just $100, you'll get your very own fraction of a bitcoin that you can spend anywhere on the internet without a credit card, saving your identity in those sensitive place when semi-privacy is required. Go to  and get yours today! Major credit cards accepted."
I can't wait. ; )

The "Hory shet! People are buying illegal drugs!" argument generally comes from detractors. You won't find any serious advocates for the idea of bitcoin using the "hey kids! buy drugs with btc!" ploy. 
This is the man behind mtgox.com. He's also most likely Satoshi. He holds upwards of a millions coins, I'll wager:
A genius of a geek comes up with a badass idea that others find useful and he's making money on it. By this definition, Bill Gates is a bigger scammer than Satoshi. At least the bitcoins are yours, unlike Windows.
As of this moment, one bitcoin is about 20 times stronger than the dollar. As long as bitcoin stays stronger than the world's rapidly dying reserve currency, it's gonna do fine.

It's cheaper than Paypal.

Cash is also used for illegal activities on a far larger scale than bitcoin. I assume you have the same issues with cash?


.65% is just outrageous, isn't it?

It's a network protocol with software testing being conducted on the fly. Its acceptance appears to be growing rapidly.

Good. I don't want the general public anywhere near bitcoin. Look what the general public does to everything.
@_date: 2011-06-14 05:07:37
As there's not yet a reported case of bitcoin double-spending, it goes beyond being confused. The blog in question is engaging in FUD.
@_date: 2011-06-06 05:44:22
Who cares about "legal"? Bitcoins traded on USB sticks are untraceable.

Medical weed is legal in California.

So sorry. The Economist is either ignorant or lying. It doesn't speak well of their due diligence or their honesty either way.

Crapping glass shards is better than paypal.

They're still a deal if they go as high as some think, me included.
