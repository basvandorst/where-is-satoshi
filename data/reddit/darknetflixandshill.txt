And if tomorrow Kim Jung poon shoots a nuke at Japan I wonder what the markets would do... China coming out and telling a billion people that you can't trust a digital currency is going to shock the market. Its been happening since the beginning and nothing has changed but a normal price dip. Have you seen the growth? Ya dips are going to happen. Shit it's gone up 4k in 5 months.. I think a correction was expected and ofcourse China's the one to cause it. I'm glad it's this and not something serious because I've been saving up for the next chinagate scare. What's your aapl or goog done? Made you a few dollars in dividends? Lol you could pay 900 for Google and not make a dividend off it... Shit when most companies post earnings and beat expectations they still go down... Why? Because dips happen but all that does is launch it even higher. Hit me back in a year and let's see what btc is at.

Apologies. I read it more like some of the others trashing bitcoin because of a little Chinese commie drama.
