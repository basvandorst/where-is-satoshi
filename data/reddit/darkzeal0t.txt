This reminds me of when Microsoft's business had to split up because of the monopoly Windows had. And since it had that big of one, it was done on part of national security.

Thank god, the US market is so overbought right now it's ridiculous. I shorted the SPX yesterday in the March options series.

I think this is a fundamental issue to the very core of Bitcoin where transaction are supposed to be nonrefundable by design. Even if you were able to issue the double spend there's no guarantee that it gets confirmed first. 
I would have fallen victim to this as well and I should have imaged my drive and spent more time on it, but I was in a hurry to get on with life. Every time I copied my bitcoin address, a piece of malware would detect it, and replace the contents of the clipboard with a bitcoin address that looked similar. If I hadn't noticed a few characters looking strange, as well as using my hardware wallet, I would have lost about the same amount. The eeriest thing of all, no antivirus nor anti-malware software detected the malicious code probably running 100% in memory. I am now using Linux and have blown away that installation of Windows unfortunately otherwise I'm sure some anti-malware companies would have loved to perform forensics on it. Ultimately, I do not see a feasible solution until we are no longer copying and pasting long character strings. Once Bitcoin and Blockchain mature more, I think this issue would be eliminated.

Get the Nano S, it's awesome. Have had it for about 4 months and have had 0 problems with it. I like knowing that only I know how much money is on a thing that looks like a simple usb flash drive.

Whatever you do, store it in an offline wallet. You can buy them cheap on Amazon.
