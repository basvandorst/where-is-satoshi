Totally purposeful in it's misleading wording.  Not a good question to ask / gauge value and sentiment.  No bueno.

I think that while the vast majority of people view bitcoin as an investment to get more fiat, some are still dedicated to the idea of owning bitcoin to use.  
I run a small clothing brand that is inspired by cryptocurrency called Zealots &amp; Villains and when I first started accepting BTC and ETH as payment, I figured not many people would use it.  But I have been pleasantly surprised, so much so that I actually think it's a really great way for ecommerce sites to do business.  
I guess this is to say, never give up hope on the original mission, I suppose.

Totally! I kind of grouped them into one general category. Any recommendations for books/films to deep dive into?

To distract myself I started a street wear brand inspired by the tenant principles of crypto and financial markets.

Just made something for a bit of fun.  But I really think BTC (and in general, most crypto) is rooted in a really punk driven attitude.  Anyway, thought this might be a bit of a distraction/talking point away from the market fluctuations.
