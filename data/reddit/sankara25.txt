This is exactly what I needed to know. Man you are awesome! I hope it bounces back again. I am also trying lure the local business in to accepting Bitcoin and dogecoin. But this price fall is making them doubt it, their doubts are making me scared because there are always like minded fools like me in this world. Your info helped me understand the market scenario. Thanks you are awesome.

Well I brought it when it was at $900 odd. Am not an early adopter and ever since I brought it kept falling and falling. :-(

This happens all the time in CEX.IO I think it is probably some huge whale manipulating the market. :-P

China is bit harsh with BTC. I hope Google, Netflix and stripe accept BTC. So that we can say in your face to all the oppressing unfair govt in this world.

Am scared but am not panic selling. I should do panic buy I guess.

Oh am sorry. I am genuinely scared and I don't know why it keeps on falling. That is why I keep asking for some answer to wrap my head around it. Am not posting these to create any misconception or something like that. If it goes any below than $400 then I am in for a huge personal loss.

I want Bitcoin to raise forever.

True sir, but the problem is I am not an early adopter of BTC I joined in when it was like $950. After that Mt gox happened, then loads of bull crap happened. But managed to avg the price of purchases to $700. It was about to reach 700 but suddenly it went way down. :-( 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:15:44
Of course I avg it out with a by buying at $650 and also at $510 but I can avg out every time when it goes down.

LOL! Fair enough.
