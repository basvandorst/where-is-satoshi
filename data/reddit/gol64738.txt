I think that customers control their own transaction policies using bitgo's tools.  I don't know if bitgo has any additional global policies on top.  bitfinex moves a lot of coin everyday, not sure how many and don't know if 120,000 coins being moved is indicative of abnormal behavior or if this is something that bitgo systems saw regularly.

Windows is the most popular OS by market share, therefore more people are focused on finding 0-days in Windows. It was also developed on a platform by a company that consistently put security last, so lots of legacy surface to explore and tons of bloaty "extras" to muck with.  
If you run something lean and open source, there's a ton of visibility you get for free, and if you know what you're doing, you can use that visibility to know exactly what your computer is doing at all times.
You can use Windows, just don't use it to store or process any sensitive information.

That's not how to get their Google Authenticator, but it is how you would beat SMS 2FA. To steal google auth, you need for them to install an app on their phone that can read the google auth local secret, not easy.
Better to use Yubico Authenticator, which works with all google auth sites, basically does the same thing except you need a hardware token plugged into your phone for the numbers to appear.

People that do drugs are going to do them, weather they have to meet in a dark alley or buy them online.  The Silk Road didn't create more drug users, it only facilitated the folks already using drugs.  How many victims were robbed, killed by street dealers before thee Silk Road?  How many victims died because the quality control of the heroin they bought on the street didn't pass muster?
Your argument is stupid.  You probably think the war on drugs is a good idea and it's going well.

At the end of the day, you only need to protect a single secret (in most crypto cases, multi-sig, shamir, etc. not counted here).  A hardware wallet does this for you, so you don't need to care about how "hacked" your OS is, your crypto secret is safe.
Of course, if your box is hacked, you have other issues to deal with, but your crypto should be safe if you're using a hardware wallet (and it stays nice and cold).

@_date: 2018-05-06 18:38:15
And the second most common mistake I see people make is using their phones as 2FA (even Google Auth keeps keeps a local secret, bad).  Your hardware secret should be kept cold (like a yubikey) when not in use.  It also requires a physical tap if you set it up that way.  For those that want solid protection for 2FA, research Yubico Authenticator.

There is no consolidation of power here; I'm really not sure where you're getting this.  Hashpower determines all, not you or me.  If there's any power consolidation happening, it's at the miner level, not Mike or Gavin.

I think the words "competing" and "teams" are wrong for any open source project.  For a successful open source project, you need a two things (at least): a knowledgeable and selfless leader, one who understands the vision of the project and makes the big decisions; and contributing developers.
If you look at the Linux kernel, which I believe to be the most successful open source project to date, you will find Linus Torvalds at the top, the lieutenants under him that he appointed (and that share his vision), and the thousands of contributing developers doing most of the work.
Is there any reason why bitcoin development can't follow a similar model to Linux kernel development?  Is it that there are so many different visions for the project that no leader can be agreed upon?

If we want to keep businesses transacting on the blockchain, we need to solve the problem of full blocks.

I don't think what they did was a "pre-test".  They already warned of the upcoming "test" in September.
I find it odd that even though they were slamming the network with legitmate transactions, many of them weren't being mined.  It almost seems like a few mining pools came together, somehow identified transactions from coinwallet, and let them collect dust.
I think their test didn't go as planned and they're now going to try something different.

I agree, however what coinwallet is doing is not indicative of everyday transaction volume.  The community already knows about the block size weakness, and steps are being taken to fix.  Nobody needs to "prove" anything here.  Coinwallet is simply spending marketing capital here to get people to switch to their wallet technology, in a very crass way.

it sounds like you definitely signup using the SMS option.  As soon as you try to perform a transaction or a login on the BitGo website, you should be receiving a code to your phone.  If you do not then simply click on "resend code" on the two-step verification page to force a resend of the verification code to your phone.  Cheers!

What do you mean?  Participants can simply mine smaller blocks and beat the big boys in network propagation speed, to reach consensus faster and orphan a large block that didn't make the rounds fast enough. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:26:32
One of the points of his talk was insightful to me.  Let the miners decide on how large blocks can get, it's their risk:  larger size = slower propagation = more risk of successfully mined block = more reward)

The point is that I sent a transaction during the time that coinwallet supposedly crippled the network.  I'm saying that my transaction went through unaffected.  I'm saying that coinwallet is wasting their time.

Would be very interesting to see if that kind of throughput would fare well with current infrastructure.  I've always wanted to see a real world test of high volume bitcoin transactions with no blocksize limit in place.  Sure it will suffer, but how exactly (other than the obvious)?  I'm more interested in finding some edge cases and unknowns that we didn't expect.

1.  Having history is one thing, but saying that you're someone you're not is dishonest.

@_date: 2016-05-05 01:29:29
Here are some opinions that I can reflect on later to see how accurate they are.  I hope that you find something interesting here.
Was Satoshi a small team of people?  Yes, including Kleiman and possibly Szabo.  I believe Finney helped at least operationally.
Was CW a "big part" of the team?  No, but I believe he spoke with the Satoshi team time and time again on various matters before and after the initial release.  He may have been a part of some brain storming sessions on various technical hurdles.
Was CW involved in the development of the first release?  No.
Was CW involved operationally in the first release?  No.
Does CW hold private keys to early coin?  No, which is why he's currently harassing Kleiman's brother Ira to allow him to scour Dave's cold media for keys.
Does it matter if CW proves he's Satoshi in some way, weather honest or not?  No, in fact, it doesn't matter.  He's not any kind of leader or have anything to offer the platform or community today; some might even consider him a liability.  While he says he's a PKI expert, everything I've seen from him so far appears to be rudimentary knowledge.
If CW is not Satoshi, then why is he doing this?  There may be plenty of unknown reasons, but at face value, it's clear that CW is a textbook narcissist (his entire resume is highly inflated and factually inaccurate). He also appears to be a brilliant con-artist and needs this to help him fight his legal battles with the tax man.
Shame on you, CW.  (edited for grammar mistakes)

It doesn't appear to me that CW is much of a coder.  His coding examples (in Windows notepad, no less) have at least one glaring error and the style is a bit amateur.
If you look at statements made from Hal Finney, [he suggests that Satoshi coded up the first release, and that he and Satoshi were the first to mine.](

That's an arrogant statement to make.


Believe it or not, the "bigger block" camp wants bitcoin to succeed as well.


I have seen tests and simulations show that even with 8MB blocks, there are no network and/or computational constraints when using over the counter commodity hardware and your average internet connection.
What makes you so certain that the network and commodity hardware is not capable of handling larger block sizes?
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:39:20

We can all brain storm and dream up cool tech, but it's the folks that actually create it that should be credited.  It's clear that CW had nothing to do with the development of the initial release, but it's likely that he knew the folks that did.  
If he had come out publicly with an honest statement to that effect, he would have been received much differently.  Instead, he chose to be dishonest and misleading, and there is no forgiveness for that.
