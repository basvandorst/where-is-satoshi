Also if you're still in the city later in the week there's a meetup on Wednesday to discuss Bitcoins. Starts at 7pm.

Be sure to support the retailer too by purchasing a chocolate bar, or a pack of gum, or something, to say thank you for hosting the machine.

I see that you're password protecting the coins if finders aren't tweeting as per the instructions.  How long until you re-use found, but unclaimed, coins?

FYI the location is south of the intersection of King and Spadina.

I actually used the service a couple of weeks back while visiting the Philippines.  Almost out of cash I used my smartphone to get on Rebit.ph and sent bitcoin to a relative.  Confirmation was received within a few hours, the relative visited a local authorized pawnshop and picked up the pesos.  Easy peasy!

I love bitcoin, more-so when it's free! :)
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:33:19
Yup!  I used rebit.ph to send bitcoins (to be converted to Pesos) within hours, it was that easy.  I'll give coins.ph a try and see how their service is like.
EDIT: grammar

Thanks!  Went ahead and bought one to support the makers and for open source!
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:15:48
Yup! Super easy to use!

How much is left on your contract? Are you going to take their offer? It seems ridiculous to me.

Happy Cake Day!

Maybe the better way is to replace "Bitcoin" with "Blockchain" so that Bitcoin=bitcoin for the uppercase-challenged.
Blockchain the protocol, Bitcoin/bitcoin the currency.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:54:22
This is cool!

Ok here goes...
-I like it as (another) source of information relating to Bitcoin.
-I don't care for the autoplay.  I prefer to pick and choose the topics I want played.
-I typically use the site for price tracking and Bitcoin news.
-I love watching panel discussions, especially their take on issues of the day.
-I would like to see spotlights on local individuals and businesses/community about their views. e.g. farmers market, food truck vendors, students, seniors, etc.

Ok I've completed the survey.  Hope I was able to help.
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:21:24
Participated in the survey, it was was quick and easy!
@_date: 2015-04-12 06:44:06
Have you checked out Rebit.ph or Coins.ph?  Maybe can help?
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:03:47
Fond memories at that location.  It was one of the very first gathering places u/adiiorio (Anthony Di Iorio) created for meetups and talks/presentations of all things bitcoin/blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:44:32
Haha! Digital OCD!
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:33:32
Comrade Bitcorn?
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:43:32
They sold those to BitSent and are being serviced (read: not yet available).
