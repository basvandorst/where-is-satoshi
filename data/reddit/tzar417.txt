Why is cold storage so hard? Isn't it just storing the key on a drive that's completely off the network?

So Electrum will store my code on my PC, I know it wouldn't be secure but just asking, is there a way to just get the code, save it manually on an encrypted drive, and then only put it back onto coinbase or something when I go to sell them? (Or buy with them.) Would it just be using like a paper wallet?

I'm looking at buying small sums for now, but I still would rather have it saved locally rather than just on their network. 
Does something like Electrum charge for use? I downloaded it and when I go to setup a wallet with 2 factor authentication, it says a small fee would be charged on each transaction that uses the remote server. Does that mean every time I go to move the money in/out of the wallet I'll get charged a fee?

To start, what do you think I should use, something like Electrum? I'm probably going to use Coinbase to buy some BTC, is it a simple process to store the BTC elsewhere once I buy it there?

So if I bought BTC on Coinbase, I would then transfer it to say, Electrum on my PC for storage, and there it would stay until I decide to use it?

I have it setup, and am using Electrum, it's all rather simple once I understood it.

Honestly, just because I like the idea, and finally have some funds that I can purchase with. I'm not doing anything large at the moment, I only bought $50 worth and just messing around with it.

I have an android phone, so I could do that, but I'd feel safer with it on my computer/a cold storage backup drive, is it really that much harder to do than a mobile one?
