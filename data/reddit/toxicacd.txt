Don't worry, it'll be confirmed. Had a transaction with 11 sat/byte confirmed two hours ago within 20 min. Maybe I was a little bit lucky, but you're good.

Um... I don't want to spoil the party, but you guys do realize this guide is for testnet?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:07:52
Don't be afraid. This works. Hence its value.

Sorry. It was the wording and writing style I guess.
I'll see myself out.

You can use your Nano S with Electrum AND your full node
* Configure Electrum to work with your Nano S
* Install and configure [Electrum-Personal-Server](
* then connect Electrum to localhost
Now you can use your Nano S via Electrum, using your full node to send and verify transactions ��
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:47:05
You're welcome. If you are trying this setup, feel free to ask if you're stuck or something.
I love it - Electrum is the best Client anyway. No need to bother with the Ledger Chromium Apps.
And just by using Electrum-personal-server you can use Electrum with your own full node.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:36:57

What?! Then what's holding you back from transferring all these fractions to a new address, making it a whole bitcoin again?
One bitcoin is one bitcoin, it doesn't matter at all whether it's fractions accumulating to that amount, or the whole coin held in a single address.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:31:24
Do your hardware wallets have wifi capability? Probably not. There you go.

Electrum 2.9.3 doesn't support sending from Segwit adresses yet.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:56:05
Tree fiddy.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:20:54
Please leave. Sober up. You are just being ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:42:46
Only if you send to legacy addresses. Electrum cannot display the funds of your segwit addresses.
At least that's my opinion.
Could you provide a screenshot of Electrum displaying the balance of one of your segwit addresses? (blacked balance of course)
I'd be really curious about how you manage your segwit addresses in Electrum.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:00:42
Barcode Scanner+ is able to do that.
Take a screenshot of the qr code and share it with the Barcode Scanner+ app. It will search the picture for qr codes.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:02:18
No, he didn't import it because that is not possible as I am saying and repeating all the time. But he is trying to. Because he doesn't know any better.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:51:36
Get out of here and stop being silly. This ist not 4chan.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:59:28
Couldn't you just post the transaction id? Or look at it yourself? Does the receiving address start with a '3'?
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:18:26
Only if it is a legacy adress! But OP is talking about sending from a segwit adress, isn't he? Ergo: he will not be able to see the balance of said segwit adress, and therefore not be able to send any from it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:48:09
And he is wondering why his funds will not show up in Electrum.
And I say: that's because they reside on a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:57:16
Alright man, whatever suits your fanny.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:20:56
Then we will just leave it with that, because I HAVE tried and I know that I am right.
No bad feelings.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:05:54
What do you mean with "previously sitting in this wallet."? Are those .002 BTC supposed to be still there? Or are they somewhere else?
If they are still on a legacy adress associated to your wallet - like a change adress - you should be able to see them.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:08:56
Yes, this helps a lot. Because then Electrum should work and show your funds.
That is all I wanted to know. Your funds reside on a legacy address and then Electrum should indeed show your balance.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:35:38
When creating a new wallet from a seed, klick on Options and tick the CheckBox "Bip 39 Seed".
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:40:29
Ups. Sorry. I thought we were still talking about Electrum.
You can import a Bip39 Seed in -Electrum-.
Just click on Options and select the Bip39 checkbox.
Don't know about Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:41:28
Look who's talking! What are you doing here, harassing others?
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:35:03
If the receiving address of that transaction was a segwit address, then this is perfectly normal behavior, according to my observations.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:47:10
"He incorrectly posted" ��
Get over it, no need to harass anybody like: you got to work on this, shame on you.
Get some manners, you are being ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:41:22
Ha! What did the trick? :D
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:44:04
Oh come on, get out of here.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:27:05
That solely depends on how Bittrex will handle the fork.
You better ask their support.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:35:50
But you sent to a legacy address, didn't you?
@_date: 2018-07-13 20:19:24
You're welcome :)
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:34:52
And $2700?
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:11:46
That's all I was arguing about - whether he wants to manage funds on a legacy address, or on a segwit address! Because Electrum cannot handle segwit addresses ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:31:35
It does, but you have to specifically select it, when restoring.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:04:55
There are no ledger seeds. There are BIP 39 seeds. They are all compatible.
OP obviously uses Tails. He is trying to recover a wallet to use it.
This is done via seed.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:06:17
Don't worry, you'll learn.
It is possible.
@_date: 2018-07-13 20:10:31
Your seed is all you need, no worries.
Recreate your wallet anytime you like, by entering the seed words in Electrum.
(Click New/Restore, Standard Wallet, I already have a seed)
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:45:04
Naw, all good with me. I'm happy to maybe have been of some help. I guess -Hayo- and me were a good team :)
Glad you got your funds back, that is what counts.
Cheerio! Have a beer on us, okay? :D
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:14:25
I would disagree to that. If that would be true, I would be able to see the transaction I did. Which was: migrating my coins from legacy adress to segwit. Electrum doesn't see that transaction.
Ledger Wallet does. Because it supports segwit. Electrum doesn't yet.
But that's only my two cents.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:23:51
If you don't insist on using TOR, meaning privacy isn't really a necessity, then try using it using the internet. That rules out a misconfiguration of TOR.
(whereas I don't think that's very likely, because TAILS handles this via firewall rules)
Edit: 'using the internet' is of course hilarious. I mean, not using TOR.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:16:07
Yes, that's another point of failure that got sorted out. And a good conversation after all :) *high5
Nevertheless, OP is still out of luck :( Poor OP.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:47:18
No, we were not!
OP wants to SEND from a segwit address using Electrum.
Not to receive from a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:59:49
Doesn't matter, glad you have your coins back ��
Read about it. How to secure them.
Maybe buy a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:56:41
Only if you know that you have to send it to a legacy address in order to use it in Electrum.
That's what I said all along: OP is not able to see/use his funds, because they reside on segwit addresses. Therefore he will never succeed in importing the seed in Electrum. It will show zero funds. Because these are on segwit addresses. Which Electrum cannot handle.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:49:32
Managing your funds in Electrum only works if they are on legacy addresses. That's what it was about all the time.
He will not see his funds. TOR is probably working alright.
Simply because Electrum cannot deal with segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:36:44

You obviously have no idea how Bitcoin works.
Not even how the core client works.
Google will help.
