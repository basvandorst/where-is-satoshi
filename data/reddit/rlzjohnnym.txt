No. You get the price today.  you will get .72. If you bought from your checking account on 1/5 you get the 968 price

You cannot act as a know money exchange because of KYC and AML
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:01:18
What are you trying to do? 
You cannot set a buy stop lower than market price, it will automatically trigger and you will be filled. Just use limit. 
If you are using buy stop to play a break out, just put it below a sell wall. If you put buy stop limit, and the price shoot past your limit you won’t get filled. 
If you buy stop at 5400, limit 5500. You can get filled up to 5500 only
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:12:45
That is impossible. Where did you buy it?

Can you naked short BTC anywhere? ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:08
Their strategy is to buy BTC, short futures and dump BTC at once, when futures crashed they can cash in. But CBOE sets margins at 44% which means their leverage is fucked and they have to unwind slowly instead of dumping it all at once.

Coinbase / GDAX is where everyone started with. Once you have gotten your feet wet, you can venture out to different exchanges, but get a hardware wallet. That is the most important thing you need to do, learn now when your portfolio is small not after you have 100k and got it stolen

You are not verified from Coinbase, once you done that, you don’t have to redo it for GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:41:44
Don’t use CC to purchase BTC. You are paying for slippage, Coinbase fees and 30% APR on the CC. that is dumb.

Never buy at one level. Buy more if it dips but HODL. If you sell now and it shoots to 20k and you buy then it crash to 12 and you sell and it goes back up again to 18. You will lose your shit. Just HODL

Buy stop only on higher than market price, once triggered it will turn into a market order. If you put a stop limit, it will trigger but only fill up to your limit price. 
Sell stop only on lower than market price
Otherwise it is a limit order, and will only execute at that price or better 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:20

Have a core of position and extra to trade with 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:25:43
There is no easy way to do it. You have to figure out the amount.
Divide the USD with the current price to get the amount. 
If the current price is 16000, 1000/16000 = .0625
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:46:37

Someone just said buy everything up to 20k
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:29:07
Why oh why? Always keep a core of BTC and day trade to get an extra 1 or 2 to add to your stack. Never sell all never go full retard.

Bubblicious yes

Get a hardware wallet. Paper wallet only if you plan to hold for a long time and not do anything with it. It is a use and destroy kinda thing.

You could if you want to deposit to a new address. If you just want to put everything in one address, you don't have to connect it to pc, although it is not recommended. 
With paper wallet, when you sweep, you expose your private key, that paper wallet is done and you have to make a new one. With hardware wallet, your private key is always safe and you can send and receive easily. 
It is also much harder to keep a piece of paper safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:29:23
Crypto is different it is deflationary, so just HODL and earn. Just put in what you can afford to lose and forget about it.

Word on the street : When Tether collapse, there will be a run on exchanges that accepts them like Bitfinex. This will cause them to shut down and panic ensues and everyone will rush to get out.

Then stop using it! Who cares? Go buy some shit alt coin ��

Doesn’t matter, if the IRS wants to, they can track where the coin goes and point it to localbitcoin. Not saying they will bother with 5k, but they could. You can mix it and wash it a couple of times with Monero if you are paranoid. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:29:57

You are such a dumbass. If I buy 100M Tethers and exchanged it for BTC, someone is holding the bag. And if you can’t redeem it back to USD, you are holding worthless crap. Why would an exchange hold Tethers when they can hold USD? 
Why would an exchange TRUST Tether the company when they stated Redemption is not guaranteed? Again show me proof of deposit and redemption using Tether from ANYONE!

There is a difference between investors and speculators. Some try to time the market to capture all ups and downs and they are the ones causing the price swings. Long term investors that believe in the future of crypto could care less. Always invest what you can lose only, don’t fucking mortgage your house and you will sleep better at night.

There are millions of traders. Basically the market price will make arbitrage impossible. Say a Jan 18 contract of BTC of  8000 at a premium of 2000. In order for market maker to sell this futures to a buyer he has to buy the underlying at the current price of 7200 and hold it up to expiration, as the price of BTC moves up and down, he will buy and sell the necessary amount of BTC to make sure he is not naked short the underlying and vice versa on the long side. This will add a lot more volume and liquidity to BTC.

You can buy directly from your checking account but it will take 7 days to settle. At least you could have some BTC
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:24:44
Yes. With all futures there is a possibility for arbitrage. If the futures is priced at a premium, a market maker can sell the futures and buy the underlying asset to lock in the premium, if by expiration, the asset didn’t go over a certain price, the market makers keeps the premium. 
For example if BTC futures for Feb 2018 of 13000 is 3000,
a market maker can buy BTC at today’s price of 10000, and lock in the 3000 premium, if by Feb 2018, BTC is 12000, he pockets the 3000. If BTC is 20000 by then he would have sold his BTC for 16000 and don’t get the 4000 extra in profit. Works on the other way also.
TLDR, futures trading will add a lot more liquidity into BTC

The main problem with BCH is the miner control. If one person or a group of people that control the hash rate can dictate the transaction speed, they can also dictate the transaction fees. Eventually we will end up with that same problem. With BTC, once lightning network is fully implemented, transactions will be much faster and fees will plummet. In the mean time, put some cash into BCH and enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:07:52
