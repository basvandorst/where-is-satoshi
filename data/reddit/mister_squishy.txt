People need a way of comparing an entire crypto market to another crypto market or non-crypto market. BTC v Ethereum, BTC v Gold, etc. Price doesn't translate alone. You're not providing a replacement solution for this. It would suffice to say that a "market cap" for commodities might exhibit different properties than one for equities or bonds. Some might say "notional value" is a sort of market cap used for the swaps market. Unless there's an outright purchase, you couldn't sell all of a company's shares for the last transact price times all issued and outstanding stock. So your point about that wbitcoin doesn't really stand. If you're going to claim that "market cap" doesn't exist you need to provide a way to value the entire market beyond just your own subjective "whatever you paid for it, bro".

I think it’s a little presumptuous considering since the last downturn we have yet to eclipse an ATH. I’m not ready to say the bear market is over, and the length of the bear market will have a big impact, even if you’re holding for the long term.

Are you sure about LIFO? I did a little research on that and while I only read secondary sources, references to IRS guidance was specific about requesting FIFO timing for inflows and outflows.

You need a way to reconcile the fact that in your thought experiment I will spend more money than you, not because of the price alone, but due to the combination of price and circulating supply. The onus is actually on YOU to come up with something better. It is as if we’re using a flat head screwdriver on a Phillips head screw. You don’t even have a screw driver and you’re going around making fun of everyone for using the wrong screwdriver, but it works anyway. Market cap for crypto may not be comparable to market cap for equities, but it doesn’t matter. Apples-to-apples it works just fine for comparing crypto-to-crypto or even for comparing against commodities like gold. No one is arguing that the dollar value of the market cap implies that you could buy everything in the market for that price. You came up with that. And by the way, equity valuation makes a lot less sense than market cap. There’s all kinds of funny math that gets done to justify wonky premiums or try to quantify the present value of earnings you *think* a company will make 5-10 years down the road. But like I said, it doesn’t matter. Since the flaws you mention are all of equal and proportional impact among markets, “market cap” still presents a useful tool for comparing the size of one market to another, even if the estimation is consistently too high.

Are two different statements.

Nothing or a slight uptick. Futures will introduce an easier way to short. Those who are borrowing BTC will buy back to use futures instead, causing an uptick.
The futures themselves will be cash settled, and the price action will follow the spot price or the physical price i.e. futures price will follow BTC-USD/BTC news not the other way around.
Can't find a reason for futures going live to kick the price of BTC down, so it goes back to being good news = price goes up.

I didn't even panic sell... I panic transferred from my trezor and panic picked a high tx fee. Cost me 0.15 to send 0.8. FML

The conspiracy theory is that the two things had anything to do with each other, which they did not.

First of all, relax. I said they weren't old, not that they weren't backed by anything.  DiD yOu ReAd iT? ArE YoU ReTaRdEd? My point was that for every complaint, WS has their own instrument that suffers from a similar "problem". W"not being backed by anything" specifically, there are other non-CDO examples: weather futures, total return swaps, exotic derivatives etc.

Totally agree. How can people on CNBC deride Bitcoin for being “new” or “volatile” or “not backed by anything”? How old are CDOs? How old are default swaps? Wall Street has invented dozens of instruments backed by nothing, invented to increase volatility or risk, and now for some reason they are all skeptical of bitcoin. You seriously mean to tell me that Bitcoin is gambling backed by nothing, but a levered Total Return Swap is fine?

I think they were saying that about the design, not the user base and organizational structure. Monero and Zcash/coin are both more “anonymous”. Not exactly sure what OP means by *more* decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:14:25
Says they guy who is not even making an actual argument. The first CDO was in 87, so not that old. Weather futures are backed by meteorology which is a less exact science than things like technology and cryptography. Also I've had multiple buy-side jobs pre and post-MBA working for mutual funds and hedge funds. I haven't picked up a finance textbook in years.

The amount of financial illiteracy you find on r/bitcoin is such a pure irony it stings the senses.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:03:36
If you bought it within the past 12 months you don’t even have cap gains to pay because you have no gains. The last time we were sub-5k was in August / September of 2017.

What? You’re going to have to explain that. After working in finance I don’t see how this displaces i-banking anymore that it just adds a tool to their Swiss Army knife of how to raise capital.

Except Bill Miller bought Bitcoin a few years ago when all the clowns you are referring to we’re doing what they do.

He ran an sec approved investment firm for many years. That WAS the Ponzi scheme. That statement was written as a slight to the SEC.
