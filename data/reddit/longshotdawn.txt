ELI5 please.  I'm not a troll, I just want  to fully understand the perspective of those for and against BTC and crypto in general.

Bitcoin ETF?

He's probably talking UK price. GBP

I've had no trouble with them personally, buying or selling. Have a read through their  [Help pages]( and maybe look them up on Reddit or other forum sites to build up your own trust.. or not.
[Local bitcoin]( is a website I hear about from time to time but I have no experience with them.

Did America just wake up?

ELI5 please.  This is my first time hearing about XLM.  Is it seen as an alternative to ETH then?

Riiight... ��

Neither do I but it sounds fantastic!! ��

That's what I'm seeing.  I'd love to hear a better explanation.  Is my BTC going to crash? What future development could encourage the price to continue rising?
The guys over at Bitcoin Cash are looking very smug right now.

How do you view fees?

That's what I thought.  So we're saying it's at a high level at the moment, I was just wondering what the community general consider to be healthy.  The chart u/darthairbox linked indicates an average of around 25,000 over the last 30 days if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:18:18
Is that (as close to 0) even possible with such an active user base?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:09:54
What is a normal healthy level for unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:19:46
Thanks. So should we be looking for a norm of about 25,000?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:05:06
u/darthairbox linked me to [this webpage](  It seems to indicate that an average level of unconfirmed transactions is 25,000... for the past 30 days at least.

I was wondering the same thing.  With the BCH update 10hours or so ago, it looked like mining would go back to BCH favour.  But hashrate and profitability is back with BTC currently.  I'm completely lost lol.
