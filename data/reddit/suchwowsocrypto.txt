Perhaps your negative attitude has something to do with a lack of understanding of the potential for DOGE?  The transaction speed for DOGE is fast, making it very convenient for tipping AND for everyday, practical purchases.  It could be easily integrated into sites like YouTube, G+, and Facebook...can you imagine getting tips instead of "likes?"  It's great for charitable purposes (the community behind it is the most generous I've seen yet).
The crypto-world is VERY young.  No one knows how far any of these coins will go yet.  It's really pretty hypocritical for people to be so derogatory towards other currencies, as they are all relatively similar.
Sure there are a lot of "younger" people swarming around DOGE.  That doesn't have anything to do with the coin's cryptography though.  There is a lot of potential with DOGE and it is such a shame that it gets bashed by people who invest in other cryptos just because the "younger" people are promoting it with such exuberance!  There may be a lot of those younger people supporting DOGE, but I can assure you, there are also numerous people who are older than you (business professionals, professors, business grad students, and the like) who are also excitedly promoting it.
Who said cryptos had to be such serious business all the time?  What is *so wrong* with having fun while promoting it?  Why not just chill out a bit?  If it turns out to be nothing, then what so what?  What would it matter to you anyway?  What if it turns out to be useful?  Are you so against it that you would cut your nose off to spite your face?  There's absolutely no argument against the coin (that I've heard from you) that would warrant such disdain.  If you don't like the excited nature of some of it's supporters...SO WHAT?  What does that have to do with the coin in and of itself??
