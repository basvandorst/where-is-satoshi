You should consider spending some. Not because they could go up or down, but because by spending some you'll be helping to build the BTC community and maybe even increase the value for your remaining coins. Spending, not hoarding, will accomplish your goals. 
Sure spending BTC10k on a pizza in 2010 might seem dumb now, but if everyone just held their coins there's no way they'd we worth what they are today.

Dammit, I already closed by RBC accounts about a year ago. I should open a new account just to close it in protest.
I'd be more for the 'private business, they can refuse whoever they want' if anyone could setup a bank in Canada.

Oh, I completely agree. Just at least there not going to the void.

maybe, but because BTCs can be divided smaller and smaller the system works even if there's only 1 whole bitcoin left.

I agree, and made a similar comment below. The evidence might be enough to allow the police to get a warrant to search the guys computers though. If they can find evidence of the first wallet the money was transfered to on the machine I'd say they'd have a good case.
More likely they'd just have to execute the warrant and interview the guy, or maybe even just interview him. A deal to pay back the $3k and receive a lesser sentence would start sounding like a good deal pretty quickly.

I'm sorry for your loss, and that your roommate turned out to be a jerk. Also you don't need 100% proof for a court, the courts work on a balance of probabilities, so if it's likely they'll side with you.
All that said, are you sure your proof is definitive? It sounds like your know that you had coins, some stuff happened, your room mate ended up with some of them, then your friend ended up with some of them, and then some of them came back to you.
It's that 'some stuff happened' that I wonder about. What you said is almost certainly what happened, but lets pretend Roommate had a friend name Thief. Say Thief stole your coins while visiting Roommate, then later transfered some to Roommate to settle a debt. All the same steps would hold, but your roommate would be innocent.

1) The signup and login pages don't accept passwords that contain a percent sign followed by a letter. So "password%u" is not accepted (but strangely "password%" is).
Results in a:


2) When you go back from the forbidden signup page the "I have read" checkbox is checked, but if you set another password the 'Sign-up' box is still disabled until you uncheck and recheck the checkbox.
3) The session cookies are HttpOnly, but not Secure. So it's possible for them to be sent over not SSL connections.
One good thing is that the email address accepts a '+'. On a lot of sites this doesn't work. Now if only I could find how to change my password...

I agree it's misleading, or at least confusing. Are they claiming that someone has or could have 'Total Control' over the decentralized network? Because this isn't necessarily the case.
I disagree that the second picture is centralized. Even those there's a central node it doesn't mean there's a central authority. That depends on the protocol and how the nodes are chosen. Many P2P systems could end up with a graph looking like  without being centralized, and if the 'center hub' went down it would route around it.
Even OPs title isn't really true. If nobody has control then it would not exist. Instead everyone with the money to buy good hardware has control.

True, which is why a lot of companies buying/selling in a different currency will hedge their currency risk.

The system may change though. There's motivation to move in this direction because there are risks with a limited amount of people that can successfully mine. We may see changes that allow both ASIC miners and CPU miners to both contribute.

While I agree there's no sign of how this happened, or even if the poster modified the code to cause this, the 'already executing code' part doesn't hold.
The bitcoin-qt code is running locally, but it's processing data from others. It *could* be this data that causes the double-free.

The problem is you can't just start a bank in Canada. There are 5 by law. 2 so far have closed accounts related to BTC.

On the possession of stolen property: I don't know, but I doubt it. For one it's generally only prosecuted if the person knowingly accepted stolen goods and that could be hard to prove. For another, I'm not sure cash that travelled through multiple accounts could be considered stolen property. I'm not saying it can't, I just don't know. It'd be like if a thief stole OPs money, bought a burger at  Fastfood-shack, and then you received that cash as change when you later made a purchase. Would you be in possession of stolen property?
I completely agree about getting the police involved. It's very likely the roommate did it and if they confiscated his stuff and started interviewing him  he'd accept a deal where he returned the money for a lesser charge maybe with a conditional discharge. Especially if they could find any reference to the original 'thief' wallet on his computer.
My comment was more to show that just because you have definitive proof that someone came into possession of money that was originally yours doesn't mean that you have definitive proof that they took it.

Sorry for your loss Turkeyslam.
Did anyone happen to mirror the page before it was taken down. If so I'd like a copy please. Also I don't suppose we have anyone at Google here that has access to any information on who setup the site?

You may want to spend some time reading about NSLs. I'm sure they would have given notice or even kept the service running if it was remotely possible.
Sure it sucks that you lost your email account, but you signed up because it was more secure, and by not just rolling over they're proving it so.
It's entirely possible the NSL required them to log the encryption keys of all or some of their users. If they'd given notice they were going to shutdown everyone would have logged in and been caught up in the net that Lavabit wasn't even allowed to mention exists.
