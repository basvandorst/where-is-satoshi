Unfortunately IMO the typical Newsweek reader will not question the legitimacy of the article. Whoever this man is, I feel terrible for him having to deal with this.

The way that it was explained to me was that this is considered another channel for investments like you said. It is separate from an ETF.

Just for the sake of argument.. Is there any way to tell theoretically how much the average exchange rate would drop in terms of percentage, if this would be put onto an exchange? I'm having trouble coming up with a calculation.

Appreciate the input, mate, its definitely interesting to see how these different forces affect the market rate.

Investing in bitcoin can certainly teach you a tremendous amount about the stock market, but because it is primarily a currency instrument, there are some key differences that set if far apart from investing in shares of ownership in a company. As the previous poster said, a great place to get started would be on the sidebar :)

Congrats on the new purchase! I am in your same situation, and I would also like to thank everybody for being so helpful in this subreddit!

Not trying to suggest anything, but would we want to look further into this when it is a possibility that BTC could be the creation of a central government agency?

Crash!? Quick everybody SELL!!!

I'd suggest learning a bit more about it before jumping in, specifically on what causes volatility, how to maintain a secure wallet, and in general how the system functions in terms of processing orders and mining.

I do agree that in the short term, Apple's endorsement of Bitcoin will certainly instill confidence among the Bitcoin user base, in the long term, Apple is irrelevant to the growth and stability of Bitcoin. By blocking any Bitcoin-related apps (especially if virtual continues to gain popularity), Apple will loose a significant user base, and alternative phone and computer companies will only benefit from their loss.

I'd suggest putting a bit of time into researching and creating a paper wallet if you plan on investing: 1.What you feel is a significant amount of money ("significant" is relative to each individual investor). 2. Long-Term. Paper wallets are the most secure storage of virtual currency at this time, but they do require you to generate them on a live Dvd-r system boot (Becuase USB can be re-written), created from a saved offline generator, and printed on a printer that does not have a file cache and is not connected via wifi.

Upvote/commenting to save thanks

Thanks! I figured it would be something similar to this and gave it a try really quick:
I took the sum of the 24-hr average volume for the top four exchanges (BT China, Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, and BTC-E), which totaled out to be ~149,737.32 BTC. The transaction in question was 194,993 BTC, so it can be assumed that this wallet has roughly 1.3x the volume in the four major exchanges. If you take the exchange price of 775USD &gt; 1BTC and divide this by 1.3 it would bring the exchange rate to 596.15.
Probably missing something major though lol

Please also include an abridge / mining section, I feel like they are very common questions from people looking into bitcoin for the first time.

Showing some resistance at 1073 on GOX
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:44:28
I say 1100 on Gox before 11.28.13 but thats as far out as I can see

Keep emotion out of it. Even with the rising prices, there is always a good point to jump in, just remember that you should be prepared to loose everything you put in in the worst case scenario! With that said, buy in, or at least get the money transfered to an exchange.
