It's a long term analysis. If Bitcoin can survive intact despite such a bad scenario then the comparatively weak attacks today are unlikely to destroy it.

Segwit2x (a.k.a. "2x" or "btc1") was a [private agreement]( among Coinbase, other large merchants, and mining companies to increase the block size independently of most developers (except for Jeff Garzik) as well as to gain control over the "Bitcoin" name. It was basically an attempt to couple a block size increase with Segwit activation. Both changes can be made separately but miners were hesitant to implement Segwit (possibly because Segwit breaks a SHA256 hashing optimization called [ASICBoost]( that requires a very specific block structure; [this structure is preserved in Bitcoin Cash]( Segwit was about to be activated by the BIP148 [UASF]( movement (which would have forked off a Segwit-activated chain) but one of the initial provisions of the 2x agreement was to activate Segwit immediately (prior to the BIP148 activation date) before increasing the block size.
To give you an idea of how little most bitcoin developers supported the 2x code, the 2x implementation (btc1) displayed [consensus-breaking bugs]( which would have stalled the network indefinitely had all miners adopted 2x.
The [2x fork was called off by the 2x-supporting merchants and miners days before miners were supposed to switch over](
The primary argument against increasing blocksize is that larger blocks increase operating costs for fully-validating bitcoin nodes. Higher costs would lead to fewer nodes which would increase centralization which could lead to bitcoin becoming vulnerable to attacks or manipulation.

If all those preprogrammed nodes were compromised you as a node operator could use the `addnode` command to specify an IP address for your node to connect to. For example, if you knew the full node at 123.123.123.123 was a reliable full node then you could use this [command]( (see the Console tab in the Debug Window of the Bitcoin Core GUI):
    addnode 123.123.123.123:8333 add
Assuming that honest nodes their mining equipment control more than 50% of all competing hash power, your node will easily be able to discern the honest blockchain from one peddled by malicious nodes and miners after it connects to a single honest node.

Smart contacts. Lightning Network transactions are all bitcoin transactions that at any time can be published to the blockchain (which closes the channel). One thing that makes them Lightning Network transactions are anti-fraud mechanisms that allows a victim to punish anyone who attempts to publish an outdated channel state. The punishment is that the victim gets to take all bitcoins in the channel. The assumption required for this deterrence to be effective is that all parties (or an authorized "watchtower" agent) have to be online to monitor the bitcoin mempool for fraud attempts.  
Watch and listen carefully to these three videos. The deterrence is explained in the second video:

Or Carol can spend some of her bitcoin on the LN via Bob, replenishing some of his balance. 
If Carol spent as much as she earned and transacted in amounts lower than the channel capacity she has with Bob, then Bob would less likely to end up with a zero balance in that particular channel. Carol's bitcoin would form closed circuits across the LN (with some bitcoin siphoned off as fees to LN node operators). If LN nodes were plentiful, LN fees were zero, and everyone spent as much bitcoin as they earned on LN (closing no channels), then LN would be stable. What will be interesting to see will be how closing and opening of channels affects frequency of unbalanced channels occuring. How will a general tendency of people to hoard bitcoin rather than spend it affect the network?
It's all very exciting to see this play out for the first time.

If Carol wanted to receive more payments from the greater lightning network she would have to 1) convince someone to establish a payment channel with her in which she does not supply all the bitcoin in the channel or 2) spend bitcoin through her LN channel with Bob, thereby bringing his balance above zero.
This is why LN intermediaries may charge a fee in the long term since they have to front a significant amount of bitcoin to supply channels, especially if they establish channels with people like Carol who are paid so often that their channels become unbalanced often.

Once the channel between you and Tor Guard is established (1 jump), you can pay or be paid by anyone who also has a channel open with Tor Guard (2 jumps). In fact, the same is true for **any** number of jumps so long as a route exists.
Now that I think about it, in Eve Online terms, establishing a Lightning Network payment channel is like creating a wormhole to connect your home system to another star system. Like all wormholes there is a mass transfer limit (read: channel balance limits) every time you send a ship from your home system through. Unlike all wormholes in Eve, your personal wormhole's mass limit can be replenished by accepting traffic back into your home system (read: receiving BTC payments). The analogy also applies in regards to hauling / couriers. Let's say your personal wormhole connected your personal star system with the Isanamo star system. Your personal wormhole doesn't care that the fuel blocks you purchased in Jita had to have been transferred through the NPC stargate wormholes between Jita &amp; New Caldari, New Caldari &amp; Alikara, and Alikara &amp; Isanamo. Goods (read: bitcoin) can be transferred to/from your personal star system (read: your personal LN wallet) from anywhere in New Eden (read: anyone on the greater Lightning Network) so long as a route of any number of jumps (read: payment channels maintained by other untrusted third parties) exists. 
In this analogy, standard bitcoin transactions are like having to use a jump freighter instead of the stargate network to haul goods. The major differences are that these are special jump freighters that have an unlimited range, have no fuel / distance penalty, have an unlimited cargo hold volume (read: no BTC limit in transactions), but are subject to a jump rate limit on the global number of jumps made by freighters of their class (read: blockchain space limitation). You can place your freighter's jump request higher in the global queue by using more jump fuel (read: transaction fee) but fuel is expensive. If the Eve Online developers offered both options for players to use then the personal wormhole option would be used the most while players would constantly bug developers across the official and unofficial forums to increase the rate cap on the unlimited cargo hold freighter jumps.

You said it yourself: block size increase leads to a loss of decentralization.


Why are you concerned about this? They will encounter the same scaling problem as Bitcoin if their transaction rates reach the same level as Bitcoin currently experiences. Are you concerned that the BTC tokens you purchased are not gaining USD value fast enough for you? If so, then say so. Say that you want developers to change bitcoin in your financial favor at the expense of decentralization. 
The question of decentralization is a question about survival. Bitcoin is a fluke among digital currencies because it has managed to survive. What has set Bitcoin apart from other failed digital currency initiatives is its decentralized nature. Don't take a cryptocurrency's survival for granted.
The survival of a cryptocurrency does not depend upon whether it wins mass popularity contests. All that matters is that at least two full nodes survive the node operators find the tokens useful. It may take that cryptocurrency's survival through several simultaneous global disasters to prove the worth of its decentralized nature but it will eventually be proven. Developers that think long-term understand this.

I am not trying to sell Lightning Network. It can sell itself. I am more interested in understanding the use cases that will result when it becomes mainstream.
edit: Supply limitations drive up fees; in Lightning the limited supplies become 1) the amount of mobile bitcoin remaining in channels and 2) the number of node operators (who are limited by bandwidth, data storage, and bitcoin opportunity costs). Therefore, OP's question hits at one of the primary drivers of fees in LN channels. I'd like more technical discussion on that subject.

How would the blockchain transaction fee be paid for the first time-locked transaction?

The superceding punishment transaction can have a high blockchain fee already programmed in ahead of time. 
I guess there could be problems if many LN channels suddenly had insufficient fees to close themselves out. But it's not an insurmountable problem. Hopefully the LN implementation being used advertises a child-pays-for-parent capability to bump a priced-out closeout transaction into the blockchain quickly.

Assuming the blockchain is already downloaded? Much less than a second after the transaction is received. Every full node keeps track of a set of [unspent transaction outputs]( (a.k.a. "UTXO") which you can think of as the latest state of address balances.
In reality, there can be no "negative" balance. The word "balance" doesn't apply to bitcoin.
If a transaction attempts to spend an output that a node does not know about, then the block in which the transaction is embedded will be considered invalid. In practice, full nodes can be configured to temporarily store "[orphan transactions]( (see `-maxorphantx` modifier in the [console commands]( which are transactions missing one or more inputs; storing some orphan transactions is useful since chains of transactions may be received out of order. However, blocks cannot contain orphan transactions; all transactions in a block must reference outputs from transactions in previous blocks.
However, if you are firing up a full node from scratch, it can take several days depending upon how much RAM you allocate the bitcoin process, CPU power available, or bandwidth you have.

Try this analogy:
A Lightning Network (LN) payment channel is a pair of ATMs linked by a wormhole. You can send money in one end and it comes out the other. You and another person can summon a pair of linked ATMs into existence by making a special bitcoin transaction ("2 of 2 multisig"). The ATMs can only send so much money in one direction before money needs to be sent in the reverse direction. Also, you can't pull money out of an ATM and put it into another ATM without collapsing the wormhole. However, if a person controls more than one ATM, they can program one to pay out if the other receives money (acting as a relay). 
Applying this analogy to shops:
You want to buy a hat from a tourist shop you visit while on vacation in Iceland. They don't accept your own country's money and you forgot to buy a cash card at the airport. But the shop says they accept  Bitcoin on the Lightning Network. So you pull out your smartphone which has one of these imaginary payment channel ATMs I've told you about. Months ago you had established a pair of these ATM's with your hometown's credit union which, in turn, is connected to the greater Lightning Network via many payment channels. So you tell your smartphone app to pay bitcoin to the funky QR code the hat shop teller shows you. Behind the scenes, your LN app identifies the QR code as an address identifying a person on the lightning network who you want to send money to. So, through a route-finding process similar to how the internet routes data packets, your app figures out a chain of people that own their own pairs of wormhole ATMs through which your bitcoin can be relayed. You only personally would know the first relay in the route, your credit union. Beyond that, the other relays would appear to you as only anonymous strings of numbers if you opened the "Advanved" menu in your LN app. But you don't need to understand these numbers in the same way that you don't need to understand how the internet works in order to use Facebook. So, your app finds a payment route, calculates the relay fees, and sends the money through when you press "send". The route is secured by clever cryptography and rules so none of the relays have the power to steal money sent through them. All this takes place in a few hundred milliseconds after you told your app to make the payment. A second later the hat shop teller's screen they will see "Payment Received" pop up on their screen. You can now walk away with your new hat.
The benefit of this arrangement is you never had to have even known this hat shop existed before being able to pay them. All that mattered is that the hat shop was able to show your phone the code identifying it on the lightning network. From that code alone your phone is able to identify a payment route from you to the hat shop.
 Also, the fees will be much lower since LN payments are limited more by transaction size and bandwidth than by space in the blockchain. If your credit union starts charging high fees for Lightning Network access, you can establish a payment channel with another business or even that sketchy nerd who has been going on about bitcoin for years and years. The protocol is designed to be secure so you don't have to trust any single entity.

I like the gift card analogy.
Lightning Network is a set of magic gift cards that can send money to other gift cards instantly. The gift card size is a limitation; you can only top off a gift card, never increase its max capacity. Also, people can link their gift cards together in a network to route money around to each node.

Coins are created because all full nodes of the bitcoin network agree that those coins exist. They agree because each full node is able to independently verify that the new block satisfies all the consensus rules. Any full node that deviates is immediately shunned by any full node it tries to share deviant blocks with.


Potentially, yes. If most mining nodes (full nodes equipped with hashing hardware used to generate new blocks) collude in order to prevent undesirable transactions from being made (ex: enforcing a blacklist on addresses of known political enemies) then those transactions will may be significantly delayed. That is the problem known here as "mining centralization". It is an artifact of the fact that rapid advances in mining hardware capacities are being made in order to "catch up" with current semiconductor fabrication technology (state of art is [10 nanometre]( soon to be [7 nanometre]( the shelf life of mining hardware is on the same order magnitude (weeks) as the shipping time required to deliver the hardware from Chinese manufacturers. Therefore, chinese mining hardware manufacturers also currently dominate bitcoin mining capacities (see Antminer, Bitmain, Jihan). I expect mining centralization to be less of a problem as mining hardware capacity improvements slow down as all low-hanging fruit in remaining fabrication technology are utilized; once shelf life of mining hardware increases to several more orders of magnitude beyond semiconductor capacity doubling times, then mining hardware manufacturers will find it more profitable to sell and ship their chips rather than to simply plug the chips into their own company facilities (which is mostly what happens today).

When both 1) [the elliptic curve cryptography that bitcoin uses]( gets cracked and 2) when [SHA-256]( becomes compromised.
Hopefully small numbers of test cases of bitcoin thefts get detected by bitcoin developers in time for them to roll out a [hard fork]( before too many coins are lost.
It is also why you are advised by developers to never send bitcoin to an address from which bitcoin has already been spent. The act of publishing a transaction that spends bitcoin from a particular address [reveals the public key of that address]( which otherwise would have remained hidden by SHA-256. Knowing the public key makes the task of calculating the private key easier for quantum computers.

No. He only needs one "safe" (a payment channel) to anyone on the Lightning Network and it does not have to be with the person he wants to pay.


Again, you only need a single payment channel to any node on the lightning network to pay anyone else on the lightning network. All that matters is that a route of payment channels exists between you and the person you want to send bitcoin to (and the channels have to be big enough to conduct your money). I imagine you only have to establish channels with two or three reliable nodes who are willing to keep the channels open for years; then you will be able to cheaply pay anyone on the network.

Miners do not simply attach the previous block's solution to their own candidate block's solution. The protocol requires BOTH the previous block's solution as well as the candidate block's transaction data be used as inputs for the hash algorithm when generating the candidate block's solution. Therefore, when one of the inputs to the hash changes (such as when a new block is published) the mathematical puzzle is reset. In a sense, this creates a new problem to be solved for which previous solutions are of no help.

How well do you actually understand Bitcoin?
From my understanding, Bitcoin USD/BTC price rise is only an ephemeral artifact of a long-term change in how money works. Bitcoin may very well be outcompeted in usage and price in the short-term by more centralized cryptocurrencies that prioritize adoption over long-term security. Are you willing to wait potentially years before Bitcoin's decentralized properties are proven superior in the long-term?

I still suspect you need to look at the BTC amounts, not the estimated USD amounts (based on volatile USD/BTC exchange rates).
Specifically, look at the transactions in a block explorer and see how much in transaction fees Coinbase may have taken off. It should all be explicit in any block explorer since the blockchain is public.

I'll try and spell how "computers crunch numbers" with a simple but long example.
Let's pretend the letters "baltimore" are transaction data that needs to be added to the blockchain.
A miner would take the transaction data, tack on a number called a "nonce" and input it into a program called SHA256. SHA256 is a special program that many programmers use. When you put data in, it spits out a "hash". For example, if I input the letters "baltimore" into SHA256, you get:
    40602f2f304e438d9683d9c39249c84ed71198ecc1cbe5f19ae9efc4d741e25a
So, if we pretend "baltimore" is transaction data, a bitcoin miner would do something like the following:
    SHA256("baltimore0001") = d0eb753ec63acb3233c1527c9e7e951888ed24feb8b7cb305c428109d824826a
    SHA256("baltimore0002") = 382394b467442b791534676093abbdafd3f8ee78d0bbe05e28867cdeec185f1e

In this simple example, the third hash was "**0**cc01a84". That first zero is important. **You could say that single zero tells us that we solved "baltimore" with a difficulty of 1**. If you kept on increasing the nonce from 0004 to 0005, 0006, 0007, and so on, you would eventually find a hash that had TWO leading zeros. I'll try that now and show you my results below:
 
    SHA256("baltimore0004") = 66793d4e25b88e56154bcd38fed934662660fa74bc0cf699c37cc605995ac9b8

GOD ALMIGHTY, I FINALLY FOUND ONE.
Okay, so I manually hashed "baltimore" with a higher and higher nonce until I finally got a hash that began with two zeros (the hash begins with "**00**428c16f"). In this case, "baltimore0538" was the winning ticket. **You could say I solved "baltimore" with a difficulty of 2**.
As you can see, it took me only 3 tries to get a solution at difficulty level 1. It took me 538 tries to get a solution at difficulty level 2. I imagine it'd take me a few tens of thousands of tries to get a solution at difficulty level 3 (I'm not even going to try).
**The whole point of forcing bitcoin miners to have to find rare hashes with leading zeros on them is because it means no one can predict when they'll produce a hash of a given difficulty**. I had no idea that "0538" would be the winning nonce. However, you can easily verify that I did my homework by plugging in "baltimore0538" into [any SHA256 calculator]( and seeing the two leading zeros pop out in front.
Note: This isn't how difficulty is defined in bitcoin, but it gives you an idea of what difficulty represents. Higher difficulty = more leading zeros.
Note: I didn't go into the details of how SHA256 works. Just know that it produces unique gibberish if you put in unique data, even if you are just incrementing a single number tacked onto the data.
**TL;DR Mining by hand is hard.**

I think what she is referring to is that the incentive to loan money out (ex: 1 BTC) and expect to be repayed more money (ex: 1.1 BTC) wouldn't work if the money supply were finite and everyone tried it at the same time. At least that's a justification for money printing that I've heard used to defend deflationary currencies. 
I haven't encountered an argument why a finite money supply is incompatible with a growing economy. Like you said, I suspect gold's inability to be reliably subdivided and measured for mundane transactions as its value rises made it a cumbersome in comparison to fiat paper notes whose value could be regulated at the expense of giving a central authority the ability to print new notes. I suspect that a finite supply of divisible tokens like Bitcoin is compatible with both a growing and shrinking economy while fiat currencies such as the USD are only compatible with growing economies. 
I don't have time to list my reasons or attempt to defend my points but these are my current suspicions.

I say let zero transaction block miners continue giving up transaction fee income. If you asked me to decide between   network decentralization or instant transactions I would choose decentralization.
Near instant transactions are already a thing for most people with credit cards (albeit with settlement delays and political restrictions). We know centralized systems work. I think decentralized systems can achieve instant transactions, minimal fees, and political resistance. However I do not think that Bitcoin Core can achieve all three points by itself; it needs a separate truncated blockchain protocol to handle large  batches of transactions.

My interpretation:
Mining hardware devs recommend and push forward a solution that is convenient and beneficial to them. As producers and sellers of equipment the more familiar  and self-serving solution is to make changes that require more (or replacement) equipment be installed.
Bitcoin software devs recommend and push forward a solution that is convenient and beneficial to them. As  custodians of the software going into the future, the familiar and self-serving solution is to make architecture changes now to decrease the difficulty of maintaining blockchain software in the future.
It's an odd situation where hardware developers have more freedom as time goes on than the software developers. Any low-level change the bitcoin software developers make will have to be dealt with forever; they must be conservative and carefully plan the software's future. Bitcoin miner producers are free to iterate and make changes to their hardware designs so long as their hardware produce output data that meets the bitcoin protocol; they don't have to be conservative since they aren't responsible for curating the blockchain.

Miners. They can pick-and-choose which transactions get incorporated to blocks they mine. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:49:14
I agree. Imagine if the majority of developers supported regular block size increases (2 MB, 8MB, 32MB, 128 MB, etc) in order to competitively inhibit the growth of off-chain solutions. As a full-node operator in the US I could participate until maybe 6 MB blocks (using 10% of my available bandwidth).
Here's my reasoning:
Each MB of block size is 144 MB/day of disk space required (1 block every 10 minutes). That's approx. 52 GB/year.
Hard drive costs on Amazon.com seem to be between 0.03 and 0.05 USD/GB. So, with 1 MB blocks that's about 2 USD/year assuming no hard drive failures. I can manage 2 USD/year.
Visa says they handle about 1,736 transactions per second. [^1]( In the past 3 months bitcoin had a high of 4.06 transactions per second on 2017-02-24. [^2]( Bitcoin must handle 427.6 times more transactions than it does now to compete with Visa.
If bitcoin were to have such blocks today, and since 1 MB blocks every 10 minutes requires about 2 USD/year, all full node owners would be required to spend 856 USD/year (71 USD/month) in hard drive costs alone and be downloading 428 MB blocks every 10 minutes (5.71 Mbps). As a node owner I know that I usually end up uploading more than 10x what I download. Even though I could download blockchain updates (my download speed is 11 Mbps), my upload speed is only 800 Kbps so my node would be unable to even keep a single peer fed with new blocks.
I would prefer to only contribute 10% of my upload speed to bitcoin which limits me to 80 Kbps. Given 1 block per 10 minutes that means I prefer a max block size of 6 MB.
I think I could increase my efficiency by renting a virtual machine in a data center. However I like being able to physically control my full node. I like knowing that the entire bitcoin blockchain and network could be restored using data copied from my single node.

My thoughts on your bus example:
* The private bus system was put into place to bypass a  state-regulated bus cartel that charged every city resident a flat % tax on all money they owned if any member of the bus cartel needed a bailout.
* A breakaway group of the private bus system wanted to create a system of larger and larger busses that would require larger and larger bus depots.
* As time went on fewer and fewer private individuals could afford to maintain the larger and larger bus depots required to maintain the breakaway group's bus system.
* The old private cartel members joined the breakaway group and encouraged larger and larger busses until they were as big as the State-run private busses.
* Once the busses were so large that very few private entities could afford to physically maintain them (the old cartel members, in fact) the State could hold their bus depots hostage with only armed few law enforcement agents.
Off-chain methods such as the Lightning Network in this metaphor would be:
* People recognized that they didn't need busses capable of carrying them to any location in the city. Instead, groups of people could decide to live close to their most-frequented destinations before they needed to make their trips, eliminating the need for busses entirely. 
* People who used this clever strategy to avoid clogging bus systems still needed to use the bus system to go to unfamiliar places on occasion or to move to a new neighborhood if some new destination became their most-frequented place.

I think this is the part of the article that makes you exclaim "If an attacker gains control of 50% hashing power, everything that is traded for bitcoin is up for grabs!". The article's point is that even if an attacker gains over 50% hashing power making blocks with a protocol that a full node doesn't recognize, then that hashing power doesn't exist as far as the full node is concerned.


Having my full node validate signatures according to a protocol that I support (the one used by Bitcoin Core 14.0) is not "an utter waste of wattage" to me because I do not want to trust a centralized cartel of mining nodes and payment processing corporations to dictate to me how my transactions are processed.

Since the most significant problem that occurs with a zero confirmation transaction is the double spend problem, how would you go about performing a double-spend with a lightning network transaction? I watched [the linked video]( and the multisig side channel example depicted at the end seemed like a secure method for all parties involved in the off-chain transactions.
Is the double-spaced risk in the establishment of the initial multisig address? I concede that I don't think Lightning can facilitate rapid microtransactions with many unique entities per second without those entities first agreeing beforehand to tie up their bitcoins in the special multisig address the video described for however long all parties are willing to keep the Lightning channel open. But if you can reduce fees by several orders of magnitude by only having to pay transaction fees for opening or closing a channel (and while a channel is open being able to make as many private transactions between the channel parties as each party's bandwidth allows) then I think using Lightning makes sense.

Implement an expiry date for every address inversely proportional to the address amount? Periodically purge the blockchain of expired addresses?

@_date: 2016-06-16 17:29:02
Scale the expiry dates so moving 1 USD worth lasts 20 years while something 1000 USD worth lasts 200 years.
Now, increase the block sizes. Nodes don't have to worry about blockchain size issues since the blockchain will be pruned if expired transactions every few years.
I want bitcoin to persist as long as possible. I want it to be possible to have a notary services that can last tens of thousands of years. Bitcoin can be a way to extend your will by making immutable statements across time. But to make such a system possible, unbounded features of bitcoin have to be bounded. One unbounded feature is the amount of transaction data a full node must have readily accessible. 
As a node owner, I want the owners of addresses to have some skin in this long game. The idea that someone can just dump their data into my node for tens of thousands of years for a small one-time cost irks me. It means future generations of node owners will be burdened to maintain data storage devices that will become increasingly full of spam and unused data. To think that we will always be able to rely upon Moore's Law is naïve to me. Some housekeeping of the blockchain must exist to keep nodes full of meaningful and useful data. This idea of expiry dates for small bitcoin amounts is a means to that end.

[Percentile of address amounts.]( No need to do any exchange rate calculation.
Every address containing bitcoin can be assigned a percentile that states the fraction of all other addresses which contain less bitcoin. An address with 10,000 BTC would probably have something close to 99.99 percentile while an address with 0.000001 BTC may have a 1.0 percentile.
Addresses with a lower percentile (example: addresses containing only a few satoshis) would expire much sooner than an address with a high percentile (example: someone's cold wallet containing 1.0 BTC). 
Expiry dates could be manipulated by manipulating the address-bitcoin distribution by spreading bitcoin across many addresses but that manipulation would still come at the cost of having to pay transaction fees periodically whenever the expiry dates for these small addresses come up.


Again, you have faith in Moore's Law. I don't think a protocol used for long-term storage of data should rely on continued faith in exponential technological progress.

Regarding methods to finding how many people agree to one hard fork or another I think the best way will be to get Bitcoin holders to cryptographically sign a standardized message stating their support of one protocol (core, Segwit2x, whatever) or another. Signing messages with the same private key that secures your Bitcoin has been a feature of the reference client (and most high quality wallets I have seen) since the beginning. By using this method automatically get usage frequency from the blockchain history and you also find out who has the biggest stake in Bitcoin by the number of bitcoins behind each vote. Sure, you have to convince Bitcoin owners to bother signing a message (or getting their exchange/webwallet to sign the message for them) which can be difficult to do especially if they have esconded their private keys somewhere purposefully difficult to retrieve. But, in my opinion, this hurdle only improves the resistance to Sybil attacks.

You don't own it in the sense that you aren't given the cryptographic key to send your bitcoin. Coinbase has been pretty reliable (no big hacks so far and they let you send your bitcoin to your own crypto key) but they hold ultimate authority to send your bitcoin (they own the crypto key). However, one of the **best** features of bitcoin is that you CAN completely own and control your bitcoin. Like, you can make it so that literally no one else but you and you alone can tranfer those coins. Not even Coinbase. Not even your government.
Google "[bitcoin paper wallets]( and "[bitcoin hardware wallet]( to how you can have complete authority over the bitcoins you buy (these are tools for generating and storing your own cryptographic keys).
That also means that if you mess up with bitcoin, you mess up permanently. It's money on Hard Mode. No chargebacks. If you copy/paste the incorrect address when sending bitcoin there's no "Undo" button. Also, you are responsible for maintaining a ledger for tax purposes (since even [the US IRS requires you pay taxes on virtual currencies like bitcoin](
So, if you want to use bitcoin, I suggest starting small and understanding how to secure what you have. Don't rush it, no matter what people in this subreddit suggest. Find a tools that work for you (for me, it's paper wallets, [Mycelium android app]( and [hardware wallets]( Treat it as an experiment and learn what you can.

There is some waiting for block confirmations but only at the start and end of a channel's life. But I agree. If you and someone are already connected to any node of the greater lightning network, then no waiting is required.

Make a transaction that consolidates all your dust into a single output address and configure your wallet to set a custom transaction fee. Some nodes (such as mine) are configured to keep a very large mempool with a ridiculously high transaction age limit (default is 300MB mempool with 14 day expiry; mine is set for 4 GB mempool with 4 year expiry). You may have to wait a long time for your transaction to get mined into a block, but as far as my node is concerned, I'll keep your transaction in my mempool for a long time and available for other nodes to copy.
As far as selling the keys directly, I don't think I've heard of anyone doing that. Find an investor who is willing to pay a single consolidated (and probably lower) amount in exchange for your private keys?

I thought about possible ways hubs could collude to rip you off, but the lightning network as explained [here]( by Mr. Poon and Mr. Dryja seems solid.
A few months ago I thought there was a vulnerability where your recipient could collude with intermediate LN nodes to not broadcast the hashinput sercret ("R" in [this video]( until the timeout occured between colluding LN nodes, enriching the nodes. But when I thought about it more, this is functionally equivalent to the recipient ripping you off by receiving payment but not delivering goods. It's not a new vulnerability introduced by introducing Lightning Network intermediary nodes into the equation.
I think the least attractive aspect of Lightning Network is probably the inability to quickly send bitcoins allocated to your payment channels to entities outside the lightning network. Before you can send those bitcoins outside the lightning network you have to wait enough blockchain confirmations for the channel to be closed. I don't think this is a big deal until blockchain transaction fees become so high that opening or closing a channel becomes so expensive that it's only worth performing every few months. Even then, an attacker wanting to bleed a node dry with channel establishment transaction fees cannot force a node to pay the blockchain channel-opening fee. Channel terms are all determined voluntarily. I can see node reputation becoming important since a node that offers to connect you to the greater lightning network but prematurely and unexpectedly closes your channel may cost you blockchain transaction fees (even though you get your channel balance refunded). Good nodes will want to be able to advertise their high uptime and low ping.

I will be running a Lightning Network node (already running a full node) and I plan on routing payments while undercutting whatever major nodes I hear about. I imagine others will do it too. It's passive Bitcoin generation without the need for mining equipment. All that is required is a secure machine with excellent uptime and a reliable internet connection. With such a low barrier of entry I imagine the competition for routing fees will force fees to be much lower than equivalent blockchain fees.
This low barrier of entry would be a much more difficult barrier to overcome if big blockers had their way and required 10x, 100x, 1000x more storage space for blocks.

One method: research and locate a reputable copy of bitaddress.org from archive.org/web . Run the HTML page in an offline computer/printer. Generate paper wallets and print them out. This is basically cold storage. You're kicking the can down the road of learning how to import private keys but nearly every wallet has this capability.
Bonus points if you inspect the JavaScript that it uses to securely call random numbers to generate printable paper wallets. Failing that find someone you trust to verify the JavaScript for you.
Another method: download and run the Bitcoin client from Bitcoin.org on an offline computer to generate addresses. If you decide to spend, look up instructions on transferring the wallet.dat (the file carrying your private keys) file to an online computer to spend them. Bitcoin Core is the most reputable developer group (in my opinion) and maintains this client. 
Another option: download and install Electrum on an offline computer. There are [methods]( to generate and sign transactions offline and then export and publish the transaction data to an online copy of Electrum for publishing onto the Bitcoin network. 
Another method: purchase a hardware wallet such as Keepkey, Ledger Nano S, or Trezor. Record the 24-word recovery seed on paper or metal and keep it and the hardware wallet device physically secure. Use hardware wallet to sign transactions with Electrum, Mycelium, or the hardware manufacturers' online interface.
Each method requires different degrees of technical expertise and trust. Generally, the easier it is to use, the more you must trust the programmers that made it so easy to use.

Buy Bitcoin from someone on the Lightning Network and have them send those coins to your Lightning address. If the seller already has an open channel with coins ready to send (a large exchange should) then you can receive your coins instantly to refill your side of your own channel between your local Lightning hub node (who doesn't necessarily have to be an exchange or anyone mentioned in this example).
You shouldn't have to create a new channel if whoever you're buying/earning coins from is also on the Lightning Network. Then, the blockchain fee responsibility is on them when they create channels to introduce new bitcoins to the Network.
If the source output contains a very large amount of Bitcoin, the blockchain fee for creating a new channel of 10 mBTC is the same as creating a new channel of 10 BTC.

The post is a good summary. I'd suggest watching [this video]( if you want a better grasp on how Lightning Network can trustlessly enable micropayments. The key is that the hash of "R" ("H") is broadcasted to all parties (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave) before "R" is.
1. Alice tells Dave she wants to send him Bitcoin.
1. R is randomly generated in secret by Dave.
2. Dave produces H by hashing R.
3. Dave broadcasts H to all parties along a payment route (Alice, Bob, Carol). 
4. Using H, all parties construct and cryptographically sign transactions that require R to be known (in other words, they are locked until R, the input that hashes to H, is added to the transaction)
5. Dave confirms (by communicating with one or all parties) that a series of transactions conducting Bitcoin from Alice to himself exists and will execute as soon as R (which only he knows at this point) is known.
6. Dave broadcasts R to all parties.
7. All parties can now publish the transactions onto the good-old bitcoin blockchain if they want (publishing = closing the channel). They don't have to, though. If they don't publish the transactions then they can continue conducting similar payments with their peers until they or their peers decide to close their respective channel.
Edit: note on point 6: Note: Dave can be explicitly assured that no party has multiple channels using the same bitcoins (so as to double-spend them) since every channel between any two parties must be initialized by a Bitcoin transaction. Dave, if he has a full node, can see all bitcoin transactions Alice, Bob, and Dave have ever made, including the ones that initialized the Alice-Bob, Bob-Carol, and Carol-Dave channels. The Bitcoin in any channel are unspendable elsewhere until the channel closes.
Edit2: This example involves 3 separate channels:
1. Alice-Bob
2. Bob-Carol
3. Carol-Dave

For bitcoin use to increase during a crisis (usage precedes demand which precedes price in the causal chain) there have to be places even in a crisis where it can be traded for [goods]( and services immediately valuable to human survival.

I think the cryptocurrencies that prioritise decentralisation above all else (small blocks, 2nd layer scaling, minimal scripting complexity) will be the one to eventually win people's confidence as a secure long-term store of value simply because they will be so hard to completely exterminate. Cryptocurrencies that do not stick to decentralisation principles will eventually have their proof-of-work datacenters or proof-of-stake owners be co-opted by local governments under threat of physical force. I think there is a huge potential for bypassing currencies like USD or EUR with [the version of bitcoin maintained by Bitcoin Core]( (so long as guys like [Greg Maxwell]( are in it).

Either party of a single channel. Signatures from both parties of the channel are required to update the amounts on both sides of the channel. Actual bitcoin transactions are being signed and traded. They're just not posted to the blockchain until one party decides to close the channel (by broadcasting the last valid transaction).
Every blue line in [this video]( between Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave is a channel. For any one of those participants, these channels could appear as in the demo video as a list of public addresses in a table. If any participant in a given channel becomes uncooperative (unresponsive, sending unfavorable transactions) then either party can close the channel at any time by simply broadcasting the channel's last mutually-signed state to the blockchain.

Minor addendum: One problem that can occur when following this procedure with other software developers (especially with older GPG software) is that some PGP keys have dedicated subkeys for signatures instead of giving their primary key signing capability. If GPG says that a file is signed by a key with an unrecognizable fingerprint then check the fingerprints of all subkeys under the primary key. You can do this by right-clicking the key in your key manager (Kleopatra for Windows and GPG Keychain Access in macOS) and selecting something like "Details" or "Properties". Subkey fingerprints and their programmed capabilities will be shown here. Look for a subkey with signing capability. There can be multiple signing keys. If its an old release the subkey may be expired.
Note: Compartmentalizing capabilities to individual subkeys is actually recommended practice but not default behavior when using GPG. See the procedures cited at the end of my post for how to set up a PGP keys like this.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:40:09
The procedure is a method for establishing trust in a single PGP key, not a website. The website having the signatures and files all available in a single webpage is a nice bonus but is not absolutely necessary. You can verify the files so long as the signatures, files, public keys, and trust path information can be obtained.
That said, I really like Electrum having a single centralized SSL-enabled website for documentation and downloads since it simplifies verification and use.

From this summary I see that the key fingerprint is `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`.
I want to determine this key's relationship to the key of a person I trust.
**I decide to do this by determining this key's relationship to Gregory Maxwell's key.**
# 2. Verify authenticity of the public key
I know Gregory Maxwell's key is `DE47 BC9E 6D2D A6B0 2DC6 10B1 AC85 9362 B041 3BFA` because the fingerprint is included in [a video presentation which I am assuming is not spoofed](
I enter both fingerprints into a "[PGP pathfinder &amp; key statistics]( website to find if they are part of the [Web of Trust]( I get these results:

I can see that at least 8 trust paths exist between the two PGP keys. A trust path is a chain of PGP key signatures where A certifies that B's identity is true, B certifies C'd identity is true, C certifies D's identity is true, etcetera. According to these results, 8 such paths exist between Gregory Maxwell's PGP key and a PGP key controlled by a person named `Thomas Voegtlin` who associates himself with the `electrum.org` website. Therefore, I conclude that the PGP key downloaded from the  website is controlled by the real Thomas Voegtlin (who recently had [a talk at the Breaking Bitcoin conference](
You can also import Gregory Maxwell's PGP key into your GPG software and then manually download all the keys whose signatures and fingerprints are attached to Maxwell's public key. If you tell your software to trust Maxwell's key (such as by using your own PGP key to sign his) then your software will provide the same information as above. The  website simply does this data gathering busywork for you.
**You have now verified the authenticity of Thomas Voegtlin's PGP key.**
# 3. Use GPG to verify the downloaded files
Now that we have determined that the PGP key with fingerprint `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6` is Thomas Voegtlin's key, **we can verify that the files available for download at  have been signed by Thomas**.
Download the installer of your choice and the associated `.asc` signature file into the same folder. For windows, choose the `electrum-3.0.0-setup.exe` and `electrum-3.0.0-setup.exe.asc` files. For macOS, choose `electrum-3.0.0.dmg` and `electrum-3.0.0.dmg.asc`.
Use GPG to verify the `.asc` file. In gpg4win (Windows users), this means right-clicking the `.asc` file and selecting `More GpgEX options` &gt; `Verify`. In GPGTools (macOS users) this means rightclicking the `.asc` file and selecting `Services` &gt; `OpenPGP: Verify Signature of File`.
In Windows, the Kleopatra app should open a dialogue stating:
    Signature created on 2017-11-01 23:36:08
    With certificate:
    6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6
    The used key is not certified by you or any trusted person.
What matters here is that Kleopatra identified that the file was signed by a PGP key with fingerprint `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`, the same fingerprint as the one we verified was owned by the real Thomas Voegtlin. I didn't use my own PGP key to sign Thomas' key which I think Kleopatra requires to change this dialogue to say the key is certified. This fingerprint is extremely difficult to fake.
In macOS, a window should appear stating:
    electrum-3.0.0.dmg        Signed by: Thomas Voegtlin ( &lt;thomasv (7F9470E6) - undefined trust
What matters is that GPG identified that the key was associated with the one I imported earlier (`Thomas Voegtlin`) and that had the correct fingerprint (full fingerprint visible in GPG Keychain, not in this popup, unfortunately). Again, I haven't signed Thomas' key (fingerprint ending in `7F9470E6`) with my own PGP key so the GPG software refuses to explicitly declare that the key is trusted. 
**You have now verified the files downloaded from  have been signed by Thomas Voegtlin, the Electrum developer.** The assumptions made were:
1. The PGP key fingerprint in that Gregory Maxwell video is correct. 
2. The  website yielded correct trust path information. 
3. Your GPG software correctly verified the signature.
# 4. Afterthoughts
Ideally I would attend a [key-signing party]( attended by several developers in the bitcoin community (including Gregory Maxwell, Luke Dashjr, Thomas Voegtlin, Wladimir J. van der Laan, Peter Todd, etcetera). Then I could have high confidence in the authenticity of bitcoin software I download. For now, though, the simplest best-effort verification method I can imagine requires the primary assumption that the PGP key fingerprint in the Gregory Maxwell video I linked is the real Gregory Maxwell's real key.

They aren't IOUs. They are fully-functional Bitcoin transactions except that the they are NOT immediately broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
The idea is that two parties can rapidly exchange updated versions of a multisig transaction, adjusting the payout amounts to each other each time. All offline. When one party wants to cash out, they simply broadcast the latest state of the transaction to the Bitcoin network. This closes out the transaction. To re-establish another offline multisig transaction channel, bitcoins must be allocated into a new multisig transaction. When the initial multisig transaction is confirmed in the good old Bitcoin blockchain, the channel is opened.

Bitcoin private keys can already be used to generate digital signatures for text messages. In Bitcoin Core 15.0.1, go to `File` &gt; `Sign message...`. posted a short [guide]( here for an older Bitcoin reference client version but it still works.
Someone with a PGP key that was part of the Web of Trust could sign a message containing a bitcoin address and claiming to own it. Messages are not hard to produce:
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    Hash: SHA512
    
    
    2017-11-02T14:37Z; baltakatei&gt; This is a signed message for -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

    -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
    
They just look ugly since Reddit doesn't have an easy way to visibly strip the signature while still retaining a verifiable message + signature in a popup or something.
Having an identity that is verifiable is good for making sure that the person with whom you are transacting bitcoins is useful. PGP as it stands now, however, doesn't allow anonymous identities to exist very easily.

I agree. Bitcoin should maintain it's decentralization properties by keeping block sizes where they are. Scaling solutions like Lightning can and should scale bitcoin. If Lightning itself ends up becoming a settlement layer upon which a tertiary layer is made to offer coffee-level microtransactions, then so be it. Bitcoin can be the ultrasecure "slow money" while Lightning or a third layer should act as convenient "fast money".
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:51:36
That's right.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:59:12
The advantages of decentralization also come with some disadvantages.
A major disadvantage is significantly lower efficiency for processing transactions. A trusted centralized transaction clearinghouse is much more efficient than a decentralized cryptocurrency since a centralized authority requires no consensus or proof-of-work; transactions can be confirmed as fast as the clearinghouse's hardware can perform.
Another "disadvantage" is that a decentralized cryptocurrency cannot be easily changed. This may be desireable by some who wish to adapt monetary policy to accomodate new needs. I have "disadvantage" in quotes because I'm leaving out the answer to the question "Whose needs are being accomodated?". A decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is difficult to change since it requires all full nodes to change the software they are running.

Hilmar Veigar, CEO of CCP Games, commenting on Bitcoin at EVE Fanfest 2017 Opening Ceremony:


A tweet from Hilmar Veigar in 2015 on Bitcoin:


:: :: :: ::
Here are my (thoughts regarding applications of cryptocurrency tech to Eve Online (and games like it).
Bitcoin is the tool you want to use if you want to bypass trusted third-party intermediaries. Which third-party intermediary you want to bypass determines the nature of the change.
If the third-party intermediaries to be bypassed are credit card companies, then PLEX sales could be improved. PLEX is a token sold by CCP Games that can be used to purchase game subscription time. Its purchase by players currently requires the involvement of [third-party intermediaries for credit card processing]( CCP Games could accept payment in bitcoin (preferably using a 2nd-layer such as Lightning Network) instead of having to pay Entrust, Global Collect, Amazon, PayPal, or WebMoney to settle transactions. This would bypass credit card companies. The benefit is saving fees charged by these third-parties but that in itself isn't subversive enough to make CCP Games more appealing to players.
However, if the third-party intermediary to be bypassed is CCP Games itself, in-game markets could be radically changed. The simplest application would be to straight up permit cryptocurrency smart contract integration with Eve Online's contract system. This would effectively legitimize real money trading (RMT) since players could then freely exchange in-game currency/items for bitcoin (or some other cryptocurrency) without threat of banning. The showstopper for this idea is that RMT is currently prohibited in Eve Online ([EULA section 6b]( and major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are recognized as money in most nation states where they have a significant presence. A softer but more complicated application would be to permit out-of-game market hubs by creating an altcoin with an item ledger that allows players to transfer ownership of items using transactions digitally-signed by player-owned public/private key pairs. The benefit is offloading large percentages of transaction processing onto this item ledger run by players.

**Short answer**:
You need to import the public key.
    gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 2BD5824B7F9470E6
The "Can't check signature" error is okay if you already think Thomas Voegtlin's public key fingerprint ends in `7F9470E6 `. This error exists since you haven't generated your own GPG key to sign Thomas's public key.
**Longer answer**:
It seems to me that there are two things that you need to do:
1. You need to import Thomas Voegtlin's public key.
2. You need to understand that the "Can't check signature" error is okay if you already have established confidence that Thomas Voegtlin's public key fingerprint is `6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6`.
The `.asc` files on the Electrum download page is a signature file. This is not the public key file (which unfortunately is not directly linked on the download page... I think it used to be... :/ ). I didn't clarify that point in my procedure. Since I assume you're familiar with command line (becuase you use Ubuntu) below are instructions on how you do it via GPG command line:
:: :: :: ::
# Instructions for importing a public key into GPG:
Use the following command ([see example demonstration for Ubuntu]( to download Thomas' PGP key:
    gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 2BD5824B7F9470E6
Notice that the final 16 characters are the final 16 characters Thomas' key's 40-character fingerprint. You could use a shorter number of characters or even Thomas' email address, but good practice is to use at least the last 16 characters.
This should result in terminal text like this:
    gpg: data source: 
    gpg: armor: BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK
    gpg: armor header: Version: SKS 1.1.6
    gpg: armor header: Comment: Hostname: keyserver.ubuntu.com

            pkey[0]: [4096 bits]
            pkey[1]: [17 bits]
            keyid: 2BD5824B7F9470E6
(I've snipped out a large quantity of key signature packets)
    gpg: pub  rsa4096/2BD5824B7F9470E6 2011-06-15  ThomasV &lt;thomasv1
    key 2BD5824B7F9470E6:
    72 signatures not checked due to missing keys
    gpg: key 2BD5824B7F9470E6: "Thomas Voegtlin ( &lt;thomasv not changed
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:              unchanged: 1
Now, your fingerprint command should work correctly. When you enter:
    gpg --fingerprint 2BD5824B7F9470E6
You should now get:
    pub   rsa4096 2011-06-15 [SC]
          6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6

    uid           [ unknown] Thomas Voegtlin &lt;thomasv1
    sub   rsa4096 2011-06-15 [E]
:: :: :: ::
 to manually import a PGP key into GPG:
If for some reason GPG doesn't have a working keyserver configured, then you can import a downloaded public key manually. Here's some instructions:
Click on the link in the text in the Electrum download page:


When the  page opens, look for the hyperlink consisting of Thomas' key ID, `7F9470E6`:


This will open a page with a lot of text. The part that matters starts with "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----" and ends with "-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----". Select this text, and copy paste it into a simple text editor.
Save the text to a file. You can name it something like `ThomasV_publickey.txt`.
If you are using a command line interface, change directory to the folder containing the text file you just made. Run this command:
    gpg --import ThomasV_publickey.txt
If you are using a GUI interface (ex: Kleopatra in Windows, GPG Keychain in macOS), you will generally look for a button or menu option saying "Import". Then, select the text file you just made.
Either way, if you are successful manually importing the key, GPG should tell you how many keys were added, how many keys were unchanged, and how many signatures added.
:: :: :: ::
# Identifying key fingerprint of a signature file without the public key
If for some reason you don't want to get the public key (or are unable to), you can also use the verbose option (`-v`) to get GPG to display the full 40-character public key fingerprint that every signature includes. Unless you choose the verbose option, GPG will truncate the key fingerprint into something more human-readable (the "key ID" which is the last 8 of 40 characters). Here is an example of using the verbose option on the Electrum 3.0.2 standalone Windows installer (after both the `.asc` and the `.exe` files saved to the same directory; command prompt folder changed to that directory):
    gpg -v --verify electrum.3.0.2-setup.exe.asc
This yields in the Windows command prompt:
    
    # off=0 ctb=89 tag=2 hlen=3 plen=540

For me, what matters are the lines:

    gpg:                using RSA key 2BD5824B7F9470E6

and 
    Primary key fingerprint: 6694 D8DE 7BE8 EE56 31BE  D950 2BD5 824B 7F94 70E6
This tells me that the signature file was generated on in 2017 on November 13th at 22:51:29. It also identifies the fingerprint of the public key used to generate the signature file. If you already are sure that you know what Thomas Voegtlin's public key fingerprint is (because Thomas himself told you) then you don't actually need Thomas's public key. However, the public key is important if you cannot contact Thomas directly. Also, malicious entities may be publishing public keys containing Thomas' name on key servers. Therefore, the public key is needed since it contains key signatures that form a [vertex]( of a larger network of key signatures which may include someone you personally know and trust (the [Web of Trust]( You can see the list of key signatures attached to your copy of Thomas Voegtlin's public key using this GPG command:
    gpg --list-signatures 2BD5824B7F9470E6
In principle, what you want to do is download all linked key signatures you find until you find a path of signatures that leads from someone you trust back to Thomas Voegtlin. For example, if you trust that Peter Todd's PGP key is `7FAB114267E4FA04` (see his [Twitter bio]( then you can find his signature and fingerprint (16/40 characters) in Thomas Voegtlin's public key in this line:
    sig 3    N   7FAB114267E4FA04 2015-10-19  [User ID not found]
After running the command `gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7FAB114267E4FA04` this should change to:
    sig 3    N   7FAB114267E4FA04 2015-10-19  Peter Todd &lt;pete

You don't. You force the propogation time between blocks across the network to be less than a certain amount of time by requiring every new block to [causally]( (not casual; causal as in "c) linked to recent blocks.
Really simple example:
Add a rule so that in order for a block to be considered the latest addition in the blockchain it must contain a transaction that spends a random output from the previous block.
If most transactions occured around Earth, then this rule would penalize miners' hash power if the mining equipment operates more than a few lightseconds from Earth.  The sun is 8.3 light minutes from Earth. If utility power from solar panels around the sun attracted a majority of mining hash power yet most people lived and made transactions on Earth, then sun miners would be physically unable to get the latest transactions from Earth until 8.3 minutes after Earth miners could get them (thanks to the speed of light limitation). Earth miners would have this 8.3 minute head start. Once a new block is found on Earth, then sun miners would have to wait another 8.3 minutes to even perform useful mining work.
The rule as I described it is way too simple but it illustrates my point.
In reality, you would probably want to make the rule account for the possibility of empty blocks or using older transactions from blocks besides the most recent. The core concept is forcing tighter causal links between blocks in order to keep the Bitcoin network clustered together. The cluster location needn't be Earth.

If you want to make sure that mining occurs on hardware physically close to where transactions are being made then I suggest adding proof of recent transaction activity into the block header. Call it "proof of ping". Otherwise, mining power will probably concentrate where energy is least expensive; this location may not necessarily be close to where transactions occur.

That said, if you query any 3rd party website about transactions (for example, copy-pasting txids of your own transactions to a block explorer), then that block explorer can correlate your IP address (and possibly your identity) with the bitcoin stored in that transaction. You can instead query your own node directly using commands like `gettxout 80d0d0dad6a85ed8ec38f665bba2170a588849036da03903ae77735968a5ebb3 1` instead of relying on block explorers. There are programs you can install on your computer that can automate this query process.
Also, your full node may leak information when transmitting new transactions onto the network. If you create a new transaction that has never been seen before, and if you rely upon your own full node to transmit the transaction to the network, and if the network contains many hostile full nodes whose purpose is to pinpoint where exactly in the network new transactions come from, these colluding full nodes could identify your full node's IP address as the origin of a transaction. There is a solution being worked on (see "[Dandelion]( to mitigate this information leakage.

It's an artifact of a block explorer not parsing bech32 addresses correctly.
You will see something similar from an outdated block explorer if you send bitcoin to a bech32 address using segwit wallet application like Bitcoin Core or Electrum. It gave me a bit of a scare the first time I saw that weird address (after I used Bitcoin Core to send bitcoin to one of my Electrum segwit wallet's bech32 receive addresses) but I confirmed that my segwit wallet was able to send bitcoin from the bech32 address to a legacy address.

Because of the threat of losing your wealth to endless inflation?
I agree with Bitcoin's token system is a zero-sum system. However, I think wealth creation can continue. Bitcoin represents a system where if you want to get more wealthy than your neighbors (most of whom, honestly, will simply hold, passively benefitting from the increasing value of BTC as wealth creation by traders continues), you must exchange value for value to earn it. Its design disallows wealth looting through loan bail-outs or inflation by debt. If the rate of wealth creation temporarily drops or if "HODLers" spend unusual amounts, then Bitcoin will temporarily resemble an inflationary medium of exchange where new tokens enter circulation so quickly that they devalue your own tokens; therefore you had better get your money's worth by investing on ventures that offer you interest on your principle to scoop up more of those "HODLer" coins. During these inflationary periods, people who want to earn more tokens can earn more tokens for the same effort as before. These are concepts that, if they are mentally internalized by people, will make the Bitcoin economy self-reinforcing.
I think a BTC economy can outcompete a USD economy. It is just a matter of competing myths.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:26:26
Bitcoin is here to stay. It is designed so robustly that it could survive pretty much anything save a human extinction event. 
That said, the matter I am most interested in seeing play out is the amount of credit groups of people are willing to issue to entrepreneurs to "grow the economy". So far, capitalism has increased the standards of living for most humans by 1) effectively borrowing money from the future (loans must be paid back with debt plus interest) and 2) promising that investments will yield a profit if they permit borrowing more money from even farther in the future. It's a self-reinforcing cycle fueled by credit that has resulted in a material-burning orgy of innovation and growth across the planet. And now a deflationary money called Bitcoin has arrived to stay which disrupts the myth that money must be spent or its value will be diminished by inflow of money from the future. To what extent are tokens such as USD and BTC "wealth" and to what extent are these tokens tools of trade? Are people rational enough to ~~loan~~ give entrepreneurs and innovators the capital to permit them to execute projects in exchange for products that improve their quality of living even though BTC can offer no sustainable promise of interest on the principle invested?As the protocol is currently defined, a Bitcoin economy must be a zero-sum system in regard to the total number of BTC tokens. Does this mean the total amount of wealth must be a zero-sum system as well?
 An economy run on BTC forces value exchange to be explicitly negociated on all exchange types from paying for food to purchasing asteroid ore. A working BTC economy requires strong confidence in specific people to follow through with their promises or at least strong confidence in arbiters of long-term contracts to enforce the terms of said contracts. I suspect such trade arbiters don't exist among corporations in today's quarter-to-quarter economy because they have not been needed; capitalism &amp; currency inflation implicitly promise that interest will be paid on principle invested so; fear of wealth loss due to inflation has incentivized participants on both sides of any contract to cooperate. What happens when participants are no longer being incentivized (read: "threatened") by fear? I like the idea of moving to a more honest and explicit system (that doesn't rely on threats) that Bitcoin offers. But what happens when participants in an economy adopt a deflationary system where interest is no longer a sustainable practice for every participant? I think the conclusion to the question of whether Bitcoin is more competitive than USD lies in whether people are capable of being honest with eachother in all trades of value. ~~Creditors~~ funders of a  long-term project must be patient to receive the benefit and ~~debtors~~ workers must be honest in fulfilling their obligation honestly. Honesty is communicating without the intent to deceive. However, in order to avoid deceiving another, a person must have a solid grip on reality; if a person misunderstands the implications of a trade due to lack of wisdom/knowledge, they cannot be totally honest. Therefore a deception will occur, even if it is self-deception. 
I welcome Bitcoin's potential for a more honest value exchange system but I also suspect (if Bitcoin is widely adopted) that the transition from inflationary fiat currencies will be messy.

I agree with most other points you've made except for this one. Hard forks should only be used with the help of overwhelming consensus. I believe that hard forks should not be used to benefit individual bitcoin owners even if those owners provably had their coins stolen through a 51% attack. Those that believe likewise would not be part of consensus of the hard fork.
Full nodes should collectively pick up the orphaned transactions and reintegrate them back into the blockchain.

Also, the only reason to be online and monitoring a LN channel is to be able to punish a cheater attempting to post an outdated channel state. The window for unilaterally taking all funds from the cheater is agreed-to as the channel is established. In the long end, the window duration can be weeks, months, or years in the future, depending on how long you want to keep your Bitcoin on the LN. On the short end it must be long enough to give you enough time for you or a LN watchtower to get back online in the event of an unexpected disconnection.

Your assertion is slightly more subtle version of an old propaganda campaign to subvert the definitions of the Bitcoin protocol and the BTC token in peoples' minds. Promoters of minority Bitcoin hardforks wish to assert that their new cryptocurrency is the "original" Bitcoin and that their tokens should be labelled BTC. If they cannot acquire the Bitcoin name they could partially succeed by forcing Bitcoin users to concede the name voluntarily by instead calling it "Bitcoin Core".
Bitcoin is the protocol defining the consensus rules that govern the operation a blockchain-style ledger that defines ownership of BTC tokens. The Bitcoin protocol uses proof-of-work based upon the SHA256 hashing algorithm. I will edit this comment when I get back to my full node to include the list of BIPs that currently define Bitcoin.
**Edit**: So, as I understand (I am not a developer but someone who has read a bit), Bitcoin's consensus rules are not easily summarized into a succinct list of rules. The consensus rules are defined by how Bitcoin clients build the blockchain with other clients. The most popular client is Bitcoin Core. Consensus rules are embedded in many seemingly minor details of the client. For example, there was a consensus breaking bug that appeared during an [upgrade from BerkeleyDB to levelDB]( that involved the maximum limit on the number of transactions permissible in a block. So, I would say that the source code for Bitcoin Core constitutes the consensus rules (as inconvenient as that may be).
That said, running the [bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo]( command on a computer running the Bitcoin Core daemon (`bitcoind`) yields information about [soft forks]( which have occurred. These include:
1. [BIP34](

Why do you want an identity system to be tied to a cryptocurrency? The whole point of Bitcoin is to permit trading of value without trust.
Identity is used by central authorities not as a communication tool but as an indirect method to reduce risk of default in financial transactions. They record customer behavior to build a model in order to extrapolate the customer's behavior into the future. The end goal is to prevent fraud. However, Bitcoin reduces fraud risk without identity being required since it eliminates the need for trusted third parties to hold wealth during a transaction. The ability of individuals to respect common myths/protocols instead of specific other individuals is what allowed scattered hunter-gatherer tribes to cooperate and build today's civilization. Missionary religions were early common myths that allowed strangers who had never met before to trust one another to the degree sufficient for trade. Money is another common myth. Bitcoin's ability to reshape civilization is based in its ability to permit strangers to transact with one another. Identity in this context just gets in the way. Identity information is more overhead that individuals have to track in their minds. Systems like Bitcoin that achieve trust without requiring identity permit individuals to form many more relationships.  The more relationships that can be formed the more work a civilization can perform.
Example: Imagine a an anonymous organization that advertises that it can perform standardized material tests on standardized steel components that have been welded and formed using unique methods and under unique conditions never before recorded. The organization accepts bitcoin, design documents, and test conditions as inputs. The organization sends detailed test results (photographs, documentation) as outputs. The bitcoin are held in escrow until a knowledgeable third party can verify that the results are reasonable. The anonymous testing organization's reputation and wealth grows while their digital deliverables speak for themselves. The religion, ethnicity, financial obligations, physical address, etc. are details that a public identity would let you or anyone interested in controlling industry to determine. However, I argue that given sufficiently reproducible product testing procedures that the identity of the organization is irrelevant to industry scalability at best, harmful at worst.
Those "sufficiently reproducible testing procedures" are where I think the next big source of fuel for the decentralization movement lies. They would help extend decentralization principles beyond the practices of information exchange (the Internet) and commerce (Bitcoin) and into matter manipulation (???) itself.

Bitcoin is money that works according to a set of rules everyone has to follow. The rules tell you how Bitcoin works. The rules make it so anyone who doesn't follow all the rules can't use Bitcoin. Bitcoin uses computers to work.
The rules can change but only if everyone agrees at the same time to change them. That makes it so no one is in charge.
Bitcoin is better than US dollars because there are rich people in charge of US Dollars. They can just make more dollars whenever they want and give it to their friends. This isn't fair. Also, these people can steal all your money from your bank account if they don't like what you're doing. Bitcoin doesn't have these problems because no one is in charge and everything runs on rules. Bitcoin has a rule that says you can't just make new money whenever you want. Also, the Bitcoin rules say you always have to give permission before someone can get your money.
**Some [rich people]( want to [change the rules]( to make it easier for more people to use Bitcoin because [if more people use it then they become richer faster]( People are calling this change "Segwit2x". The rule they want to change makes Bitcoin faster but it also means you need a bigger computer. [If you're poor a bigger computer may be too expensive for you]( You can trust a bank to run a Bitcoin computer for you but that means the bank is now your boss. If the bank doesn't like what you are doing they can take all your money. This is the same problem the US Dollar has. This is why it's important to make sure the rules say you only need a cheap computer even if it makes Bitcoin slower.**
There are other more clever ways to make Bitcoin faster without needing bigger computers or changing the rules. One way is called [Lightning Network]( But the people making it are being very careful and taking their time. They don't want to make any mistakes. If they made a mistake then people could lose a lot of money.

@_date: 2017-09-30 16:12:36


Best option if you want to explicitly choose the consensus rules (and avoid Segwit2x) is to install and run a copy of [Bitcoin Core]( Instructions [here](
Next best option is to install a [hierarchical deterministic wallet]( such as [Electrum]( ( which will generate a random 12-word seed that it uses to generate the same set of bitcoin addresses &amp; private keys. When you first use Electrum to create a new wallet it will ask you to write down the seed. Remember to save the copy of Electrum you downloaded since you shouldn't rely on future wallet software versions being backwards compatible with old seed algorithms. With your written seed and copy of electrum you can regenerate the public and private keys to generate transactions with them on the bitcoin network in the future.
I mention Electrum specifically since the developer, [Thomas Voegtlin]( announced at a recent conference that he has [implemented Fork Detection in Electrum]( which will [notify the user of a chainsplit]( (as [Segwit2x will cause]( and allow them to [split their coins]( 
 using the Replace By Fee (RBF) technique. See "How to split your coins using Electrum in case of a fork" in the Electrum Documentation [here](

There would have to be a new consensus rule that required "proof of ping" between blocks (simple example: proof that a random output in a recent block was spent). Otherwise, confirmation times would require waiting for a long round trip between you and where miners are located (not necessarily within a few light-seconds of where most transactions are signed). 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:25:08
What says is true.
Outputs are what matter, not addresses.
It is a consequence of the fact that individual outputs can only be spent if a set of conditional statements expressed in the [Script]( language are satisfied. Usually, a transaction requires only a digital signature to spend an output. However, even a simple  transaction (one that permits sending bitcoin from one address to another) requires that the spender produce a digital signature unique to the output being spent. That uniqueness prevents outputs from being pooled together before they are spent.
There is no function in the Bitcoin protocol to say "take all these outputs and pool them together without a digital signature". Banks and central ledger-keepers can perform such a function because bank customers trust the bank to be fair. In comparison, Bitcoin is extremely just; if flexibility is not programmed into the output script then the rules to spend that output are utterly inflexible. It is a feature, not a bug.
Here is what I know of Script:
Most outputs have only simple scripts attached to them. For example, if you converted such a script (call it "script A") into human-readable language it might read: if public key A that hashes to address A is provided AND digital signature linked to public key A is provided, then destroy bitcoin and create new bitcoin in equal amount under address B locked by script B.
More complex scripts can also contain conditional statements that:
1.  require multiple public keys
2. [take time into account](
3. require a secret that yields a specified cryptographic hash

I do not see the parallel. Organizing a group of developers to coordinate efforts in a paying corporation (blockstream) is not equivalent to forming a dictatorship. I still review the specifications of what they produce to make sure that their products (specifically the Bitcoin Core client) continue to maintain their decentralized properties. If Blockstream developers produce software that damages or endangers those properties (which is the first step in creating a central authority), then I will no longer use their software. Instead I will continue to use old versions that maintain decentralized principles or download software from other developers that keep decentralized consensus.
I have not loyalty to Greg Maxwell or Blockstream. If they produce bad code, I will not use their code.

Here's my understanding:
Replay protection means that transactions made for one chain are incompatible with the forked chain. In other words, if a fork lacked replay protection (such as is the case with Segwit2x) then someone could copy transactions made on the original blockchain and retransmit them on the Segwit2x chain; they would be accepted as valid transactions on both chains. This can be really bad.
**If you didn't split your coins then YOU WOULD LOSE ALL YOUR BITCOINS if you decided to download the Segwit2x client and send all your Segwit2x coins to an address you didn't control**. One example of an address you don't control is the receiving address of an exchange offering to trade your Segwit2x coins for bitcoins. This is because the transaction made using the Segwit2x client would also be a perfectly valid transaction using the Bitcoin Core client. Any troublemaker could run both a Segwit2x full node and a Bitcoin Core full node and have a program copy transactions from the mempool of one node to the other. The exchange, if they were running both a Segwit2x full node AND a Bitcoin Core full node, and if their nodes used the same address pool (probable since the Segwit2x developer is mostly copying Bitcoin Core), they would see two transactions appear on both full nodes to addresses THEY control after you tried to send the unsplit Segwit2x coins.
There's a way to split the coins safely by simultaneously sending them to separate addresses you control. Electrum's developers published [instructions for doing this]( using their software. In theory, though, I think you could use any wallet that can generate and store private keys (Bitcoin Core, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Armory, etc.). It's easier with wallets that support replace-by-fee (RBF). If you fail to split the coins (both transactions are mined into a block on both chains immediately) then don't worry, there is no problem; you just sent your coins to yourself. Try splitting them again.

I agree, but I want to emphasize your last 4 words. I think there can still exist law enforcement systems that are effective even with 100% adoption of Bitcoin. They would be much more expensive to run and probably require much wider surveillance capabilities but I think they could still function and, more importantly, be valued by a majority of Bitcoin-supporters for the physical security service they provide. This new breed of law enforcement would have to function using only voluntarily-paid taxes of the individuals it protects.

I'm roughly estimating there's between 15 and 25 million USD in that stack of sheets. That's between about 3500 and 6000 BTC (at 4200 USD/BTC).

    Bill Thickness = 0.010922 cm
    Stack Height ~= 1.3 * 8 * (height of one bill)
                    1.3 * 8 * (6.6294 cm) = 68.94576 cm
    Sheet count = (Stack Height) / (Bill Thickness)
                =  (68.94576 cm) / (0.010922 cm) = 6313 sheets
    Value of stack = (Sheet count)*(Value per Sheet)

A full node is a program that independently checks all bitcoin transactions in the bitcoin blockchain to make sure that it is downloading the correct blockchain. Sometimes people attempt to "improve" bitcoin by publishing alternate consensus rules that change how fast bitcoins are made, the maximum transaction rate, etc. See Segwit2x, Bitcoin Cash, BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc. **These "improvements" can be forced upon you unless you are running a full node**. Also, these improvements essentially duplicate your bitcoin (sometimes in a messy way; see "replay protection") but onto two incompatible blockchains. When you store bitcoin in a web wallet (blockchain.info) or an exchange/broker (Coinbase), you are letting them decide for you which blockchain's bitcoins are yours and which ones they are free to pocket for themselves.
In order for a full node to do what it does it has to download each and every bitcoin transaction ever made. It sounds tedious and it is! If you are running slower hardware or on a slower internet connection it can sometimes take over a day. However, if you are lucky enough to know someone who is running a full node you can connect your computer to theirs (get on the same LAN) and download the blockchain very quickly.

Can confirm. It really does speed up validation. Just remember to remove the `-dbcache=` modifier when you are done validating (validation from Genesis block only occurs on first start or if you are forcing a revalidation (or if you delete the data directory)). If you run out of RAM your node will crash.

\ is part of the solution but you'll make a disastrous mistake if you don't perform an additional part before \
As I understand it, the transaction you use in step \ will be a valid transaction according to both Segwit2x nodes and Bitcoin Core nodes. It can be "replayed" on the other chain by anyone without your permission.
Therefore, **IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR BTC** when you make a transaction to send your 2x coins to an address you don't control (the exchange in step \ you have to make two separate transactions: one transaction that sends the BTC to an address you control on one blockchain and another transaction that sends the 2x coins to a completely different address (which you also control) on the other blockchain. It may fail if the first transaction you publish gets mined quickly into blocks in both blockchains but the only consequence is you've sent coins to yourself. Just try again.

Individuals cooperating in a group for mutual benefit have advantages that lone individuals do not have. Cooperation by definition requires individuals to lose some freedoms (actions that threaten group integrity) if they wish to remain members of the corporation. Group security in a closed system must be ultimately enforced by threat of physical destruction. I think this describes the minimum requirements of what you would call "civilization".
Bitcoin restores freedom of trade that is restricted by Fiat Currency Groups (FCG), such as USA, EU, etc. Such groups may decide to ban Bitcoin because it restores freedoms that they decide threaten group integrity. However, not all groups may decide to ban Bitcoin; some Decentralized Currency Groups (DCG) may gain advantages from Bitcoin that outweigh the advantages that the FCGs gain from banning Bitcoin. Economic advantages include:
1. Decreased systemic risk. No government interference required to prevent system failure if large economic participants misbehave (ex: the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis). System integrity of decentralized systems is robust by design.
2. Lower barrier of entry for individuals. Ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, credit history, physical appearance, etc. are important details when interacting with banks. These details are irrelevant when making Bitcoin transactions. The productivity of [2 billion humans]( among which [cell phone access is rapidly growing]( is restricted by these details. FCGs tend to have higher barriers of entry such as identity documents, account fees, travel distance (see ["The Global Funded Database 2014"]( page 60).
3. Fraud resistant. By default, Bitcoin transactions require explicit permission from payers ("push" instead of "pull" mechanism). Assets cannot be unilaterally seized unless physical security of individuals is violated. Third-party intermediaries are not required.
Economic disadvantages include:
1. Increased cost of law enforcement. Additional surveillance required to pursue individuals that betray the group.
2. Increased difficulty to identify uncooperative individuals that fail to pay income tax, especially if they do not visibly flaunt all their wealth. Taxes must be paid voluntarily. New taxing methods may be required. 
If the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and if DCGs can successfully deter physical destruction at the hands of FCGs then eventually the DCGs will outcompete FCGs. FCGs can become DCGs if they accept the freedoms of trade that Bitcoin reenables.
I argue that DCGs do not necessarily have to regulate Bitcoin in order to exist. I believe the advantages I listed outweigh the disadvantages.

How I imagine the NYA participants view the future of Bitcoin:
Installing restrictions to make bitcoin controllable by government would facilitate it's integration with existing government regulations. This would allow those CEOs to accelerate adoption of bitcoin by average consumers, thus driving the USD price of BTC up. I imagine these CEOs believe that only a handful of cryptocurrencies will dominate this new market of internet money and that bitcoin in 2017 is not guaranteed success. Therefore, to ensure that their investment in BTC does not fail, bitcoin must achieve mass adoption before a competing cryptocurrency does. If making bitcoin palatable by government regulators sacrifices decentralization then so be it; most consumers have shown no interest in decentralization or privacy anyway; see Facebook.

If you're using bitcoin wallet on your phone or on a website then you need to contact their support (usually help documentation on their website).
If you have an independent streak and want to have completely control over your bitcoin wallet, run a [full node](
A full node is programmed with a specific set of "consensus rules" that lets it tell you whether any transaction is valid or not according to those rules. Your software won't ask a server for rule updates. You have to [upgrade it yourself]( Some of the most important consensus rules signaled and accepted by a majority of miners as of block [481824]( are:
1. [Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist](
2. Hashing [difficulty]( adjusts so an average of 1 block is mined every 10 minutes.
3. [A block size limit (Non-witness block data cannot exceed 1,000,000 bytes)]( This particular rule has been the center of [much contention](
Some[^1]( people[^2]( disagree[^3]( with[^4]( those consensus rules and want to change them (latest example is 2x, a.k.a. "[btc1]( However, ultimately you can choose which consensus rules you respect by choosing which full node software you run. Currently I support Bitcoin Core's work:
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:28:22
Try using this method I've found to quickly bootstrap my full node:
Connect your computer to a friend's laptop running a full node with a router. Login to the router and get your friend's local IP address. [Add the local IP address via the console command]( tab in the Bitcoin Core Debug menu. The command might look like this:
    addnode 192.168.0.2:8333 add
You don't need the router to be connected to the internet for this to work. You are effectively constructing a miniature version of the internet with only two Bitcoin nodes (as might occur after a severe natural disaster).
The Bitcoin software will then download all the blocks as fast as the network connection or validation process permits. This local network connection should remove the bandwidth bottleneck.
Note: if your router is also connected to the internet then your client may download from the local node slower than you'd expect; I find it will occasionally wait on blocks downloaded from remote peers before continuing downloading from the local full node. I suspect this occurs because Bitcoin Core programmers made their client paranoid regarding how it downloads from peers (prioritizing download from fast peers would allow a high bandwidth attacker to disrupt block propagation across the network).
Note: your router and computer firewalls must permit local TCP traffic on port 8333.

The New York Agreement (  ) is a private agreement between several Bitcoin commercial interests (including Coinbase) but excluding the developers of the developers of the most widely-used Bitcoin client, Bitcoin Core. The agreement was for adoption of the SegWit protocol upgrade (which increased transaction rate capacity) in August via softfork and a simple doubling of block size in November (also a transaction rate capacity increase).
However, a significant fraction of Bitcoin users (particularly the ones who prioritize decentralization over capacity/efficiency improvements which tend to cause centralization) do not support the block size doubling because it increases the difficulty for users to initialize and operate their own "full node". The full node is the primary element of the Bitcoin network which empowers users to make transactions without third-party intermediaries. 
Since Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone (neither miners, developers, exchanges, users, nor Powers That Be) protocol upgrades are messy affairs that result in splintering of the blockchain into many forks (the most valuable of which remains that defined by Bitcoin Core). Thusfar, past and future forks have involved accusations of malevolence and incompetence, political propaganda, and public boycotts. 
Coinbase in particular has added it's name to an upcoming hard fork called "Segwit2x" (the block size doubling prescribed by the NYA Agreement) that is preparing to destructively disrupt data communications between Bitcoin Core nodes. Bitcoin users that prioritize decentralization do not like the fact that Coinbase has not retracted support for SegWit2x. Coinbase has made no statement since it signed the NYA. If you could post a recording of a Coinbase representative clearly reaffirming the company's intention to recognize Segwit2x as the only "real" Bitcoin then Coinbase would probably lose many customers.
Personally, I do not support Segwit2x. I run a Bitcoin Core full node. I believe 2nd layer scaling solutions such as Lightning Network need to be tested for at least 2 years before any block size increase should be considered. I anticipate that commercial entities will succeed in creating  many hardforks of Bitcoin in their efforts to accelerate market growth by providing low-end transactions to as many people as possible even at the experience of lost decentralization. Bitcoin Cash is a hardfork that occurred recently; it won't be the last. I think at least one of these adoption-first decentralization-second forks will achieve a higher raw user count and a higher market capitalization than Bitcoin Core. It may even sustain superiority for many years. However, I believe ultimately it's comparatively centralized nature will cause it's downfall as governments attack or hold hostage the physically central points of control. It will be neutered just as PayPal was. The decentralized version of Bitcoin (probably Bitcoin Core given it's developers' continued prioritization of decentralization principles) will survive and emerge again and again as the most useful type of money.

Find someone who runs a full node on a laptop + external hard drive and have them connect to your computer via local area network (LAN) and the `addnode 192.168.x.x:8333 add` console command. Don't even need to be connected to the greater internet. That's the beauty of no central server being required. Even supposedly decentralized apps like Firechat require registration and identity verification at a central server. After your computer finishes syncing the blockchain you can connect to the internet normally and you'll download new blocks at a rate of at least 1,000,000 bytes every 10 minutes.

A hardware wallet could be used to split coins only if the software constructing the transaction (Mycelium or the Trezor website in Trezor's case) is working in conjunction with a full node on the fork chain and a full node on the original chain. I would follow your hardware wallet's developer blog to see if they'll release a tool to facilitate coin splitting. If not, you can spin up an Electrum's wallet and use [Electrum's hard fork detection and full node server selection feature]( to split the coins.

A full node independently checks all blocks of transactions it receives to make sure they are compatible with the consensus rules (1 MB non-witness data per block, proof-of-work, avg. 1 block every 10 minutes, no double spends, etc). Contrast this with trusting your bitcoin private keys to a middleman like Coinbase.com, blockchain.info, etc. who may or may not decide to opt you in against your will to a forked chain (see Segwit2x). A full node can maintain your private keys for you. A full node also shares its copy of the blockchain with other full nodes.
Don't put your life savings on a full node (consider a hardware wallet or a very well-vetted copy of offline paper wallet generating software) but if you can take reasonable steps to secure your computer (keep it patched and updated, install minimal amounts of software) I recommend using a full node as a hot wallet.
In the rare instance of a global internet catastrophe your full node, if it survives, can be the seed to reestablish the bitcoin network.

I selfishly want my tokens to be part of a decentralized system that is borderless and devoid of inflation. I want those properties because they are in my own self-interest. I want them. It is **not** in my self interest if other bitcoin node operators (including miners) decide to make changes that centralize the system. I publicly will promote upgrades that maintain decentralization over upgrades that centralize the system.

edut: cold storage instructions here:
1. I would go to  install latest version of Electrum ([verifying PGP key](
2.  Then, initialize a wallet on an offline computer; write down the 12 seed words it gives you; don't save them to any digital format. 
3. On the same piece if paper, write down the version of Electrum you downloaded and verified.
4. Save some receiving addresses; bitcoin addresses can be generated offline no problem. Print out those receiving addresses in whatever format you like. 
5. Uninstall Electrum.
6. Reinstall Electrum
7. Import a wallet instead of creating one; Electrum should ask for seed words. Enter in the ones you wrote down. 
8. Confirm that the same receiving addresses you printed out were generated again (they should have been; the wallet recovery process via seeds is deterministic).
9. Uninstall Electrum but save a copy of the installer for when you need it. 
10. Now, feel free to send bitcoin to a receiving address. 
If you want to make a hot wallet (using Electrum to generate transactions and broadcast them to the Bitcoin network) then you can repeat these steps but on an online computer and not uninstall. Just be aware that if your computer is compromised (someone besides you logs in, someone remotely hacks your computer) then they could use a keylogger ([physical]( or digital) to steal your seed words. A hot wallet should have only the amount of Bitcoin you are willing to risk losing. 
To make a hot wallet you can also use a number of [smartphone Bitcoin wallet apps, hardware wallets]( or even a [full node]( if you want even more options than Electrum (however, many of these extra features in a full node are accessible through command line interface only).

I do not support this proposal. I do not care if people think it is likely to get a majority consensus or not. I made my decision to buy/trade Bitcoin from only SegWit blocks after August 1st since I want 2nd layer transaction protocols to do the scaling, not Bitcoin's blockchain by itself. 
To me it makes more sense to use data transfer technology that has already been proven to scale well (TCP/IP) to carry the increased transaction data burden required by Hash Time-Locked Contract systems (such as Lightning Network).
To me, Bitcoin tokens themselves should be "slow money". "Slow money" tokens should be used in a settlement layer for initiating scalable "fast money" payment channels.
I trust the developers who have tested Segregated Witness. I trust that they have found and fixed as many flaws as we can reasonably expect from the most dedicated human programmers.

**Here is my really simplified summary**:
Using a Trezor to store bitcoins is safer than Coinbase because with a Trezor the bitcoin private keys are stored on the Trezor device itself instead of on a server in a datacenter controlled by someone else.
I recommend recommend reading the Trezor [user manual](
Here is [a youtube video of the Trezor in action]( Here is [a video of using it with an Android phone and the Mycelium app](
**Here is my summary**:
Trezor is a "hardware wallet". In bitcoin, a "wallet" is something that stores private keys. Every bitcoin amount in existence requires a private key to be spent. If you lose a private key then the associated bitcoin is also forever lost.
A "wallet" can be anything that can store a private key. It could be [a piece of paper]( that you print out and store in a buried treasure chest. It could be a website (like Coinbase) that you trust. It could be a USB flash drive that stores the key in a text file. It could be the full bitcoin software package that the actual bitcoin peer-to-peer network uses to run (you can download Windows, Linux, or OSX packages here:  ).
Hardware wallets such as the Trezor are purpose-built computers designed to procedureally generate private keys according to a single "[recovery seed]( When you set up a Trezor, the Trezor will give you a set of 24 random words (see [BIP39]( which can be used to set up a different Trezor (or BIP39-compliant wallet program) so that it generates the exact same set of private keys. The Trezor can also use the private keys it has stored to cryptographically sign messages proving that you control the private key (without having to disclose the private key; see [digital signatures](
Trezors use micro USB ports. With an "on the go" (OTG) USB cable you can connect the Trezor directly to your smartphone instead of your computer. The owner of the Trezor design, Satoshi Labs, provides a website to set up a new Trezor. Other wallet developers have made programs that can also set up a Trezor (ex: [Electrum](
If you lose or break your Trezor (it is just a small computer, after all) then as long as you have your 24-word recovery seed written down somewhere you can set up a new Trezor with the recovery seed and regenerate the same private keys you used which gives you access to all your bitcoins again.
[Here is a list of possible attacks on the Trezor]( I think it's important to understand how such attacks work.
In the end, Trezor users trust that the hardware of the Trezor itself run the open-source code that Satoshi Labs group says they have loaded onto it.

Sorry, I did not want to overcomplicate my post with yet another scheme for block size increase since that seems to be a subject that has been beaten to death over the past few years. My proposal basically is a way to free up memory requirements for nodes so that one of the many block size increase methods can be made more palatable.


That's a really good question. The answer, I think, would have to be to not delete the previous checkpoint block until sufficient blocks have been mined after the completion of the checkpoint block group. I say group, because since the checkpoint block will probably be large, I think it needs to be split up into subblocks so that nodes sharing high data transfer rates need not have a complete monopoly over the distribution of a very large single checkpoint block. This would unfortunately mean that nodes would need to have twice the normally required memory capacity during the checkpoint creation and verification. There may be a less memory-intensive way to perform a checkpoint block creation event, but I am not seeing it at the moment.
I'm open to suggestions. If you have a link to someone else's post with speculation on how a checkpoint block may work, I'd love to read it! I think we'll have to eventually design such a process, especially if Moore's Law fails us.

The way I see it there will be a large fraction of bitcoin owners who will not go out of their way to purchase Segwit-compatible bitcoins and will instead use whatever their familiar bitcoin exchange/broker sells them.
Like a flotilla of exploratory ships, this high inertia clueless contingent will sail on into centralized storm filled with economic sanctions and government-mandated protocol changes. Those of us who support decentralization, however, will continue sailing around the storm. Our tokens will probably attain only a fraction of the value of the centralized coin for many years or decades. It won't be until the centralized-coin faces these sanctions (probably after the local economy of whater nation-state its nodes are in crashes) that the clueless contingent will realize their mistake. 
I imagine the centralized-coin's last years will be filled with pleas by its owners for the decentralized-coin's developrs to merge its devalued UTXOs into decentralized-coin.

If all bitcoin addresses have an expiration date then using the blockchain to store data would require some minimum amount of participation inversely proportional to the amount of bitcoin associated with the data. My proposal would disincentivize filling node data storage devices with the smallest transactions (but not prohibit it in case someone really wants to store data in the blockchain by periodically pushing around small bitcoin amounts). Less data storage requirements for past transactions means more data storage would be available for the latest year's transactions; larger block sizes could be permitted. **The amount of long-term data generated by these larger block would be restricted by the address lifetime limitation, reducing costs for node operators.** (edit2: I did not want to overcomplicate my proposal with a subproposal for an increased block size since that is a subject that appears to have been debated to death.)
If you want to store a proof of sale of your house in the blockchain, then you should be willing to either annually (in my example) renew a bitcoin address' lifetime (by resending bitcoin to the same address) or associate your proof of purchase with an address with enough bitcoin that it pushes the address lifetime expiration date far enough into the future to satisfy your needs. I believe it is in a node's interest to require some level of participation from the owner of an address. If that node happens to be a miner as well, then the data that miner stores will eventually produce transaction fees when the address bitcoin is renewed. **I do not believe it makes sense for nodes in 1, 10, or 100 years into the future to continue to dedicate data storage capacity to tracking an address holding only a few satoshis of bitcoin.**
This is why I titled my proposal a "partial solution". It creates an active address destruction process that requires activity to forestall it. Just like a multicellular organism requires its individual cells to eventually suicide for the betterment of the whole organism, my proposal of blockchain data shedding would ensure blockchain data stored on nodes remains relevant and important. **By requiring periodic address renewal from users, data storage used by negligible amounts of bitcoin can be freed up for transactions of non-negligible amounts in larger blocks.** And since the blockchain would be annually pruned, larger blocks would be more easily managed by smaller nodes.

I think you accidentally the English language.
Seriously, though, when **you** run a fullnode **you** choose which set of rules to follow, not the miners. Miners can publish hard fork clients all they want but they cannot force node operators to run the client.
I invite miners to produce their own modified clients, actually. I think many people would love to see different economic rule sets in action. I think those different tokens could become very valuable.

[Here's a link to an answer other people liked](
Below is an answer specifically addressing these "riddles":
The mathematical puzzle is to assemble a block (just a digital file containing simple transaction information) in such a way that the 256-bit SHA2 hash (which is just a number) is smaller than some programmed number. The smaller the number the more leading zeros you will see at the start of the hash.
What is a SHA2 hash? It's just a number.
SHA2 is a function that takes any specific digital file as input and outputs a unique 256-bit binary number, a "hash". SHA2 is special because if you change even a single bit of the input, the output number will be completely different in an unpredictable way.
SHA2 hashes generally look like random noise. Here's a few examples with hashes in base-16 (aka "[hexadecimal](
    SHA2("Insxnity0001") = 0979d11bd06bbe9833e1341b7c86cb6ac745551ced148b6d4dab7aa89e75193d
    SHA2("Insxnity0002") = 61c1feb4ab400bc8f97ac5cdb814f104d6a789c19d43b07c84ce0e04fa2b3b4d
    SHA2("Insxnity0003") = f45593ad28d7306177bbbe7e2751980836f63140f9b0e8fd2d1ac6af49fd0cfe
    SHA2("Insxnity0004") = ec9445d3dc1478920dc3cd42ca475b8e9918e28f7595fd5a701db251289f4c5f
    SHA2("Insxnity0005") = dcfa0a9b56ae4cf9490755bddc93aa9a87362c3c9b3e35aa9519d52f22fe6d3c
Now, you can see that sometimes you get a "0" in the left-most character (the hash for "Insxnity0001"). You also see that I only have to change a single character of the input and the resulting outputs are completely different.
Now, here's another example, but with bitcoin blocks (correct me bitcoin nerds if I'm wrong). If you take the SHA2 hash of the SHA2 hash of any bitcoin block, the output hash, which is just a number, must be below a certain programmed limit in order to be accepted as valid by the bitcoin protocol. The smaller the hash, the more leading zeros you see. The latest block as of this writing was block# [465667]( If you take the block (which is just a data file) and take the SHA2 hash of the SHA2 hash of it, then the resulting hash is this:
    SHA2(SHA2(block_465667)) = 0000000000000000002acb4c87e28c279b5c617f88ae326e520160ec61dd1336
That has 18 leading zeros. It is very computationally difficult to make such a small SHA2 hash.
Also, part of Block# 465667 contained a hash of the previous block, Block# 465666. This means that if anyone tries to modify transaction data in the previous block, it will completely ruin not only the hash of Block# 465666, but it will mess up the hash of Block# 465667 as well. This is why it's called a "block chain".
If this has you interested, I invite you to read the [Bitcoin whitepaper]( that started it all.

Did you miss the part of my post where I said:
# When you spend/receive bitcoins with a full node you are explicitly telling the network what rules you want bitcoin to follow. 
Miners' income is dependent entirely upon how much people are willing to pay/work for the bitcoin tokens they generate. People vote with their fiat / hard work when they receive bitcoin with a full node or when they send bitcoin with a full node. The terms of the transaction, the rules of the blockchain, are encoded in their node which verifies to them whether or not their transaction succeeded or failed.
So upgrading your node is not enough to influence the protocol. You have to also spend/receive bitcoin; that is what gives bitcoin tokens their value. 


Proof of work is a great and critical ingredient to Bitcoin. But a cryptocurrency can be secured by ludicrous amounts of mining power yet still be worth very little if the rules of the cryptocurrency are not attractive for those that trade it's tokens.

You know what is just as hard to manipulate? Exchange prices. I would say exchange prices are even more challenging to manipulate since prices require user interaction, not just miner activity. After a hard fork the SegWit branch and this compromise consensus branch will compete for users' money. I think the branch that sets a centralizing precedent will not be as valuable in the long run as the one that favors decentralization.

@_date: 2017-05-30 05:26:18
Yes. It's all about how to change blocks to permit higher transaction rates which permit lower fees/transaction which make more use cases viable. Currently, bitcoin as it stands only supports 3 - 4 transactions per second. I'm simplifying, but if you boil down all the arguments there are two ways to increase transaction rates:
1. Make blocks bigger so more transactions can fit inside them.
2. Change block structure so they support offchain transactions.
Option  is straightforward: increase block size beyond the 1 MB limit. The major benefit of this method is that it is simple and requires much less testing. However, there is a major drawback to this method: the operating cost increases linearly with block size increases for full nodes (people and their computer that run the bitcoin software and validate transactions they receive from other nodes). When you spend/receive bitcoins with a full node you are explicitly telling the network what rules you want bitcoin to follow. A full node requires ~150 GB of disk space and increases roughly 52 GB/year. If a full node is too expensive for you to run then you no longer have a say in how the bitcoin system works. This is why people say Option makes bitcoin less decentralized, and therefore, more vulnerable to attack.
Option  is more complex since it requires changing how data in each block is structured. See [Segregated Witness]( Instead of increasing block sizes the idea is to permit people to use the bitcoin blockchain to establish an off-chain payment channel network. This network would operate independently of the bitcoin network EXCEPT when individual channels need to be created or closed out. Individual bitcoin owners could earn fees by establishing payment channels with eachother and transmitting off-chain transactions between eachother at rates only limited by their bandwidth (think: billions of transactions per second). See [Lightning Network]( Here's [an example with explanations that I am quite fond of]( Option  makes bitcoin more complex but it does not increase node operating costs, thus retaining bitcoin's decentralized nature.
I am a supporter of Option 
Edit: Some people want Option  so badly that they have modified their full node software to explicitly use Segregated Witness after August 1st. Their modifications follow the BIP148 proposal. See [UASF](

Why do you insist the developers of Core must assert their will upon users of the client they maintain? The whole point of Bitcoin is to avoid top-down master-slave methods of political control. 
Your comment implies that us users must pick a master to obey and since Core, our "master", isn't advocating political compromises that the "game is over", they have failed. That's like saying we should ditch our local ISP and subscribe to Comcast since our local ISP isn't spending as many advertising and lobbying dollars. 
A Bitcoin dev team could exploit users' confidence in order to enrich themselves and some select money-making corporations by centralizing Bitcoin (making all blocks so big only data centers can house the servers needed to run the nodes); fewer network nodes --&gt; fewer node operators to convince for protocol changes --&gt; increasingly favorable changes to node-operating megacorporations only --&gt; return to fiat monetary policy after the one or two remaining node operators are beaten into submission by a small military/police force. It's not a very interesting future. Also, in Bitcoin, there is no representative government system that "centralizers" can lobby and persuade. Users can freely pick and choose which protocol they think best reflects their ideals.
I think many users (whose ideal is short term gains) will band together to build the most attractive and user-friendly (read: big blocks to permit cheap transactions) fork of Bitcoin in order to spike the price as much as possible for short-term profit. But once the downsides of centralization are encountered they will abandon ship for a currency that is more decentralized (for the same reasons Satoshi created Bitcoin in the first place). 
I'm glad the Core developers are not fighting to win market share with consensus meetings. They write high quality code that reflects an economic ruleset they believe to be good, take it or leave it.

That's what I'm worried about: people buying Bitcoin because the price is rising. I think it very probable that they interpret price increases as proof that Bitcoin is valuable instead of investigating for themselves what unique use cases only Bitcoin makes possible. In reality, price is at the end of the causality chain and is subject to failures in any previous link.
1. Rules (block size, 21e6 BTC only, etc.)
2. Unique use cases (microtransactions, remittance, deflationary store of value, decentralized money, etc)
3. Public perception / popularity
4. Supply and demand.
5. Price
To me the "decentralized money" use case is such an important feature that any protocol rule change scares the bejeezus out of me. I need time to get used to the idea that Blocksize needs to increase. I want to explore other options first (SegWit). I've been burned too many times in real life of being offered a compromise only to find out the "compromise" was a trick. Meanwhile, I fear that rich investors are flooding in and will start demanding features to maximize price at the cost of sacrificing decentralization; after all, full node operators remain a minority so who really cares about jacking up their operating costs when all other participants can enjoy so many more profitable use cases from bigger blocks?; I am afraid degrading decentralization will turn Bitcoin into a fragile bubble when disaster strikes and not enough full nodes exist to maintain confidence in bitcoin as a trustless protocol.

I don't know, but I really like this idea.
To me, splitting bitcoins evenly between two blockchains (by making sure at least one chain locks them until they are locked on the other) is the fairest way to go.
I imagine the big blockers would lose participation with a lot of early adopters but if their goal is "achieve Visa-level transaction rates ASAP", then that's probably an acceptable loss. An additional benefit of migrating to a sidechain is no longer having to factor in the risk of dealing with all the idle Satoshi Nakamoto coins that could tilt the market (assuming Nakamoto sides with the early adopters).
Also, in the event of natural disaster or military attack, the decentralized-first chain will be more likely to survive intact. In that event, users of the adoption-first chain could, with cooperation from their chain's devs and the decentralized-first chain devs, still have the option to recover their bitcoin. If the adoption-first chain is way more successful adoption-wise (which I imagine it would be), then the decentralized-first developers would have incentive to permit reverse migration (if only to regain users).
I imagine the simplest rule for token migration between Chain A (decentralized-first) and Chain B (adoption-first) would be: "in the event of splitting, the owner of the smallest output amount in a transaction will be able to recover all coins on the previous chain" accompanied by: "if the smallest output amount is shared between two addresses, the owner of the smallest recipient address (numerically) will be able to recover all coins". That would permit easy control of tokens from the previous chain to be tied to tokens on the current chain (until they are redeemed on the previous chain).

I'm guessing because a SHA-256 proof of work scheme has a reliable probability of success with much less complexity involved than a protein folding proof of work scheme.  One would have to it a lot of thought into designing a proof of work reliant on complex physical models of amino acid interaction.
I could see it possible, though. Have miners start with an amino acid chain with the exact composition of the amino acid chain be a function of hashes of the transactions being considered. As for difficulty adjustment. I guess the ability for the amino acid chain to fold into a certain shape with a variable characteristic that is more difficult for the protein to adopt as the characteristic increases. Maybe have an amino acid adopt rigid yet irregular shape that becomes more complex (more branches, tighter tolerances). But this seems to be getting too complex in comparison to a simple algorithm like SHA-256.

But on a drivechain, shouldn't it be initially easier to push out new features (block size increases, bug fixes)? The prospect of boosting adoption rates through those new features (features which most decentralization-first developers dislike) may be more beneficial to the tokens' value than the downside of being in a 51% system. If you are not concerned about requiring decentralisation, then the 51% attack should no longer be a concern. Make the sidechain proof-of-stake or implement rules from Unlimited (that miners-authorize-protocol-changes feature).
I think what is getting at is, if adoption-first (decentralisation second) miners want to push out their features, then a drivechain makes sense. From the adoption-first group's perspective the drivechain can be the mainchain. There's nothing stopping the mining and exchange consortiums from declaring themselves the original Bitcoin. They don't necessarily have to ever cooperate with the old chain and the old UTXO. But if their venture fails, drivechain mechanics could permit their users to fall back to the old chain with the old chains' dev's cooperation.

Maybe blocksize-increase supporters ("adoption-first" as labels them) could choose an exit address, publish a standard method of locking your bitcoins on the old chain (Chain A), go to town with blocksize increases on their new chain, Chain B. Just... make the change now, create the new blockchain (call it the "original bitcoin" if they want) and start mining new coins. Maybe they decide to never reintegrate themselves into Chain A. They certainly wouldn't have to worry about Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin hoard ever disrupting the market (unless Nakamoto himself decided to pitch in with Chain B).
Then, especially if Chain B's big block strategy proves more successful, it would be in the interest of Chain A developers (presumably the majority of Core devs) to provide a well-tested and well-documented upgrade to unlock the coins on Chain A and therefore attempt to attract users from Chain B back to Chain A. There would have to be a well-thought-out method for determining how much of Chain B's coins could be transferred back (some kind of transaction tree lottery?); Chain A devs would have to release a client capable of allowing users to recognize and identify Chain B for tracking purposes. Reversing the split would have to require cooperation and tracking by both Chain A and B.

Two blockchain transactions will still be required (along with the regular blockchain transaction fee) to initialize the payment channel and to close the payment channel.
If you had a friend with lots of 1 USD dollar bills and you wanted to incrementally convert 1 BTC into USD on an on-going basis you could form a lightning payment channel with her. Then you could transact in 1 USD amounts for as long as the channel remains open (you must give a timeout when you initialize the channel). No transaction fees to miners, just whatever transaction fee your friend might decide to charge. You could even use the channel in reverse, converting USD you earn back into BTC by reallocating more of that 1 BTC back to you again.
If replace your friend and her 1 USD bill collection with an automated exchange and replaced the 1 USD bills with 0.000025 USD (1 Satoshi) increments then you can now [**stream your money**]( This is because transactions within a payment channel do not touch the blockchain; the only constraint on transaction speed is how fast your computer can compute digital signatures and send them to across the internet to your friend's automated exchange. A payment channel may become something you initialize once with a reputable exchange and leave running for years. During those years you could perform trillions of transactions in amounts as small as 1 satoshi and not pay a single fee except for when you initialize and close out the channel. Transaction fees levied by the exchange would be for bandwidth and CPU cycles, not for competing against a global economy for space in a 1 MB block.
Also, payment channels can form a larger network so **you aren't just limited to transacting with your exchange, but to anyone who has made a payment channel with anyone on the network**. Anyone can be an intermediary (and collect fees if they want).

Finding a PoW algorithm that can't be sped up by throwing more silicon at it is difficult.
What is a limited resource that individual network nodes have access to that cannot be augmented by having faster and more computer chips at a single node? Is there a Proof-of-Work algorithm that requires this limited resource (that cannot be multiplied by hardware) to make an output that is difficult to compute but that is later easily verifiable?
One possible thing that comes to mind is the network topology itself. [The traveling salesman problem]( What if a proof-of-work was to determine the shortest route through a network that touched the largest number of nodes in the shortest length of time? The limited resource here would be the connectivity of nodes between eachother; the number of connections between nodes and the physical speed-of-light limitations for ping times. One new problem introduced with this idea is that it is trivial to add more nodes to the network ([Sybil attack]( This problem might be sidestepped, however, if there were some economic cost associated with adding an additional node to the network. This would be important since the blockchain would also have to record a history of the network topology so routes could be verified at later dates. The economic cost of adding your full node to the network would be important in limiting the size of this network map; call it a "partcipation fee". One way I think could work is if this "participation fee" for adding your full node to the network map could be programmed to be the same thing as the familiar transaction fee paid to miners. There is still the problem of wealthy attackers spinning up many nodes and fabricating simulations of non-existent network sections by simulating and reporting false ping times. The "participation fee" is all I can think of to inhibit this problem.
My idea (literally thought up while driving to-and-from work) might be an old one that's already been beaten to death, but I can't find anything with Google searches so I'm curious to see if any of you can find problems with it.

From my understanding, yes it is possible.
1. Newbie sends fiat and his own Bitcoin address to exchange.
2. Exchange broadcasts multisig transaction that creates payment channel with coins purchased by newbie. This initial transaction assigns all coins to the newbie in its first state. A transaction fee taken out of Newbie's coins is charged by miner to get multisig transaction into blockchain.
3. Exchange does not close this channel. The Exchange has established payment channels to members of the greater Lightning Network.
4. As long as the payment channel remains open the Newbie is a member of the Lightning Network.
5. **NEWBIE CAN NOW SEND THE COINS INSTANTLY AND SECURELY TO ANY ENTITY ALSO ON THE LIGHTNING NETWORK**. The fee of any such instant off-chain transaction will be however much the Lightning Network nodes on the payment channel route charge to conduct the coins. There will likely be many routes possible. Since all potential routes must pass through the exchange, the exchange may set up a minimum fee to relay transactions (and to pay for their overhead needed to track the states of payment channels they have with their customers). **TRANSACTION SPEED IS ONLY LIMITED BY AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH BETWEEN NODES. MINERS, CONFIRMATION TIMES, AND BLOCK SIZE DO NOT MATTER**.
6. If at any time Newbie decides to close payment channel he can broadcast the latest transaction state of the channel and set the remaining coins under his control as output to his original Bitcoin address. He will have to pay a transaction fee to a miner and wait for the transaction to be included in a block to get this final state recorded into the good-old bitcoin blockchain. 
7. Once final state is recorded to the Bitcoin blockchain, the Bitcoin that remained assigned to Newbie in the payment channel are now in the Bitcoin address he sent to the Exchange in Step 1. 
That's my understanding but feel free to correct me. I'm learning as well.

There are no direct costs to users like Mrs. Watanabe, remittance, exchanges, speculators, and coffee buyers from block size doubling, only immediate benefits. Double the block size and miners could halve the transaction fees (if they are feeling generous). Three doublings could mean transaction fees cut by 87.5%! But full node operators will have to pay 400 USD/year, then 800 USD/year, then 1,600 USD/year. There are no direct costs for the majority of Bitcoin users from block size increases, only immediate benefits. That is what worries me. I fear that the "small price" I pay to independently verify the integrity of my money will balloon to something ridiculous and Moore's law will not be able to keep up.

Isn't the whole point if transaction fees to prevent penny transactions from inflating the size of each block? Otherwise, wouldn't fewer and fewer people be able to maintain mining rigs if the bandwidth needed to maintain the current block chain exceeded their ISP's bandwidth?
If the transaction fee were simply a proportionally small fraction of my transaction size, then what is to stop me from making thousands of 0.000001 BTC transactions per second? (If there is something in Bitcoin's architecture stopping me, please let me know. I'm not trying to sound condescending. I honestly am still piecing together how the protocol works).

[Litecoin supports lightning network.](
Admittedly a polished Litecoin lightning app has yet to come out of development but if you don't like BIP148 then this can be a testground. My prediction is that Lightning's ability to permit billions of transactions per second in off-chain channels will produce entirely new use cases unimagined and untested before ([streaming money]( Lightning will be seen as such an attractive feature for very little technical cost (SegWit, no Blocksize increase) that the greater Bitcoin network will adopt it (whether by UASF or traditional miner signalling). Even if the majority if Bitcoin wealth somehow refuses to adopt SegWit then Litecoin can fill the decentralized streaming money "niche" (quotation marks because I don't think it will remain a niche for long).

If the client is not utilizing 100% of your bandwidth or CPU try increasing the database cache size. If your system has more than 4 GB of spare RAM, edit the bitcoin.conf file (located in the directory where you installed the client) to include the line:
    dbcache=4096
This tells your client that it's okay for it to use up to 4096 MB of RAM for database stuff. If your CPU and bandwidth aren't being fully utilized, increase this number until they are. Once the blocks have been verified you can remove this option and the client will automatically revert to its [default value of 300 MB]( the next time you restart it.

You can configure your full node to:
1. Increase the mempool to some high number of MB (default is 300 MB; I set mine to 2048 MB)
2. Increase your mempool expiry time to something long (default is 14 days; I set mine to 4 years)
3. Increase the number of orphaned transactions to some  high number (default is 100; I set mine to something with a lot more zeros).
4. Increase the memory limit (default is 300 MB, I think; I set mine to 4 GB). 
I think my node (BIP148, of course) should be able to hold at least several days of transactions in memory in case an old legacy chain is orphaned and needs to be reintegrated to the new BIP148 chain. I still need to confirm that transactions older than 14 days can still be accepted into default client mempools using my node as a source, but 14 days is a long time for a chain to run before being orphaned.

Assuming they were using [miners with 0.1 W/(Gh/s)]( and an [electricity price of 0.08 USD/kW-h]( this puts power consumption at 2,552 kW and, assuming negligible electricity is used for cooling, this puts hash power at approximately 25,500,000 Gh/s

After some more thinking, one major problem with coming to consensus on ping times is the problem of timestamp consensus. How can you make a decentralized trustless network of nodes synchronize their clocks to within milliseconds? did some work on open timestamps but [he ran into the same problem of timestamp resolution]( The best workaround he had was a trusted public calendar server.
A proof-of-route method doesn't necessarily have to record accurate ping times (it's all relative) when building a network graph, it just has to record relative sizes of ping times between nodes.
Right now I figure I'll just keep thinking about how such a system could work at all (even if it is clunky) and work on optimizations later.
If a majority of nodes could be trusted to maintain accurate ping times to one another, though, that would make eliminating hashing proof-of-work a whole lot easier.

Lightning Network is wormhole gateway tech. If you can haul one of two linked gateways down the congested highway network to some destination, then you can establish very fast transport bypassing the highways until the gateways' transfer mass is used up. What's even better is that the gateways are equipped to rebuild transfer mass if you send stuff in the reverse direction (mass = bitcoin).
It doesn't surprise me that road maintenance companies (miners) do not want wormhole gateways (lightning payment channels) through their tollbooths. It's a conflict of interest.

One of the more subtle downsides of Bitcoin for mainstream fiat users: Bitcoin is a monetary system (among other things) that is not regulated or controlled for the purpose of achieving stability for any particular group. It's money on hard mode. Shakeups like this Blocksize debate cannot be avoided so long as more than two Bitcoin users exist on the network.
I think what is happening is a lot of people invested way more fiat than they were comfortable with losing into Bitcoin for speculation purposes. They don't actually use Bitcoin for much of anything so they have little idea about what aspects of the protocol differentiate it and make it more useful than fiat currencies. If they install a client is the one advertised on the website they found by googling "Bitcoin". **They aren't interested in improving the protocol or using Bitcoin to trade. They just want the price to go higher and higher until they cash out**. Now that they have a choice between protocols, each one tackling the low transaction capacity problem in a different way, they aren't equipped to differentiate the two. **Both approaches will probably increase Bitcoin value over time and so they make no difference to them**. That's why they say a SegWit+2MB compromise is okay; both options are pretty much the same to them. They are concerned with maintaining their token value over actually using the currency. But for people that use Bitcoin for its decentralized benefits, there is a clear right answer: SegWit with no block size increase.

That's only half the story.
The other half is **my** greed. **My** desire for a verifiably decentralized and secure monetary system on *my* terms. If a group of miners do not secure a system which has qualities I selfishly want, then I will not buy tokens generated in that system by those miners. My desire and ability to buy those tokens is what gives those tokens value. That value is what motivates miners to secure the network in the first place.
I want the rules governing my money to be decentralized. That is why I want SegWit (BIP148) before a simple doubling of block size or some weak compromise (SegWit2x).
I may be in a minority and that's okay. I'll buy tokens from a system which has qualities I support. Others may buy tokens from a system that they support. May the best coin win.

Ah, I think I understand now.
What I think you are saying is this (correct me if I am wrong): Most people do not run full nodes because they are not simple things to run. Therefore, since only a fraction of all people who use Bitcoin run full nodes (with most using pruned or SPV clients like Mycelium), full node operators are the "stakeholders" that all Bitcoin users must trust in order to make sure the system remains secure. This situation where Bitcoin users must trust this handful of stakeholders is very similar to how people must trust centralized authorities to control monetary policy. However, full node operators, unlike centralized authorities, do not receive any monetary benefit for verifying transactions.
I think that unfortunate situation for us full node operators is what makes me so enthusiastic about Lightning Network. It would allow us to put our always-on computer, always-on Internet connection, and saved bitcoins to work and earn transaction fees in a secure way. Lightning Network payment channels require real bitcoins to be tied up in every parent channel between any two in the network. Channels cannot conduct any more Bitcoin than what was allocated in the channel when it was initialized. Our connectivity, bandwidth, and idle bitcoin could gather us even more Bitcoin. Useful work for reward.
As for full node operators being a limited resource (and thus similar to a central authority since they are trusted to enforce the protocol rules) in the Bitcoin network, my response is: that is even more reason for us full node operators to refuse to adopt any block size increase. Block size increases are equivalent to taxation without representation. You're right. The only reason I run a full node is to make sure I'm not getting scammed. The only reason I process your Bitcoin transactions is to make sure, on the off chance I do business with you in the future, that our transaction will comply with the 5 rules I stated earlier. A block size increase just means I have to store and process even more transactions, all of which I cannot throw away since in theory any one of the could affect my future transactions. If possible I would support a cryptocurrency that had an amount-time-based expiry on UTXOs but I have yet to see a currency deploy that kind of policy.

No, they don't.  In Lightning Network you don't have to trust anyone. SegWit is required to make this possible but Lightning Network is trustless. Any breach of protocol by any node in a transaction chain results in all coins in the payment channel to be divied out to all parties according to the final channel state. You can't spend coins, break a channel early, and get your money back. As soon as you send coins they are effectively gone; all your would-be victim has to do is broadcast the final state (which you signed) to the bitcoin blockchain and get his money sent to his address.

I am not as familiar with etherium as I am with bitcoin so I cannot tell you one way or the other.
I recommend buy and use the tokens that you will find useful even if the price gets cut in half. Price is so easily manipulated by political fighting and wealthy speculators. My rule of thumb is to buy bitcoin as long as it remains useful to me; that is, if it retains [these characteristics](
1. Scarcity: final number of the symbols
2. Fungibility: all symbols are interchangeable, commodity like. Symbol A is identical to symbol B, and vice versa.
3. Divisibility: the symbols are easily divisible, so you can divide them to smaller and smaller portions
4. Durability: the symbols can survive the test of time and weahther and won’t be worn out or disappear
5. Transferability
Bitcoin's scaling difficulties (limited transaction rate) harm item  ([increasing transaction fees for limited block space]( This problem can be eased by increasing block size (2MB hardfork) or implementing [2nd layer scaling solutions]( (SegWit). The block size increase is more risky than 2nd layer scaling since increasing block size also increases operating cost of full node users (the people who download and distribute the full blockchain since 2009). In other words it may harm item  This can lead to centralized control and erroding of all 5 points for the benefit of whoever gets control of bitcoin's future. However, I think most believe that both block size increase and SegWit will be necessary if bitcoin is to scale for all 8+ billion inhabitants of planet Earth; the current conflict ([BIP148]( is centered around *when* to implement which solution.
If you consider "investing" in bitcoin, I advise that you closely watch its protocol changes. Soft forks. Hard forks. If it looks like the rules are about to change in a way you don't like, sell your bitcoin and buy money whose rules you like.
Be prepared to accept the consequences if the price of the tokens you buy falls to zero. Cryptocurrencies are experimental. They are very volatile. Don't rely on price to tell you if a token is good or not. Study its rules and decide for yourself.

**Short answer:**
Currently, nodes of the bitcoin network do not receive any monetary compensation for performing the work they do. This might change if [Segregated Witness]( and [Lightning Network]( are adopted (see further below).
**Long answer:**
The primary benefit for you if you were to run a full node would be the ability to independently verify that any transaction you make to/from other bitcoin owners follows a certain set of rules, including:
1. only 21 million BTC. No endless inflation.
2. all bitcoins are fungible
3. past transactions cannot be reversed
4. no trusted authorities need approve your transactions
5. network nodes need only add 1 MB every 10 minutes (144 MB/day) of blockchain storage
[The minimum requirements for running a full node are](
1. ~150 GB of disk space
2. 512 MB of RAM
3. Windows 7 / 8.x, Mac OS X, Linux
4. 250 MB/day download bandwidth (+ 100GB initial sync)
5. 10 MB/day upload bandwidth
The big debate among bitcoin users now is how to increase the network's transaction rate capacity (currently about 3 transactions per second). Transaction fees have risen to well above 1 USD for even the simplest transaction. Failure to pay these transaction fees results in your transaction not being included in the bitcoin blockchain. For years, bitcoin has enjoyed transaction fees of less than 0.01 USD per transaction. I'm simplifying, but the debate boils down to two methods for increasing transaction capacity:
1. Make blocks bigger so more transactions can fit inside them.
2. Change block structure so they support offchain transactions.
**Method  is simpler. Just increase the current 1 MB/block size limit so more transactions fit into each block. The big downside is that fewer people will be able to afford equipment to run a full node since those requirements I gave you will increase linearly with block size. If you can't afford to run a full node then you are forced to trust others to verify that those 5 rules I mentioned are being followed. **If you don't run a full node you are forced to follow whatever rules the person you trust agrees to**.
**Method  is more complex since it involves changing how the transaction data is structured inside each block. See [Segregated Witness or "SegWit" for short]( The main benefit is that "off-chain transactions" become much easier to perform. Basically, SegWit gives you the ability to perform an unlimited number of transactions through a payment channel network where the only limitation is bandwidth. See [**Lightning Network**](
The [Lightning Network idea]( would allow full node operators (such as Bob and Carol in the video I linked) to trustlessly establish payment channels with their own bitcoin for users on the network (Alice and Dave). These Lightning node operators could charge fees for conducting these off-chain transactions (a task that could require a lot of bandwidth). Currently full node operators get no benefit from doing their work besides being able to independently verify transactions as I mentioned earlier.
SegWit is very cool. Unfortunately, SegWit is incompatible with a quirky mining optimization technique called [ASICBOOST]( that boosts mining equipment speeds by ~20% but requires blocks to be structured in a highly restrictive way (preventing protocol upgrades like SegWit). Also, if people use Lightning Network to transact bitcoin then they would pay fewer transaction fees which otherwise would be paid to miners. As a result, SegWit has not achieved the 95% adoption among miners that the deployment plan created by its programmers required (a requirement to avoid a "chain split", where network nodes decide to follow different incompatible rules; it's generally considered a destructive event for bitcoin).
Some miners and full node operators want Method  (SegWit) so much that they have collectively decided to implement SegWit on August 1st without *any* consensus %. [The node software package they run is called "**UASF BIP148**"]( It is a modification of the reference bitcoin client that has been reviewed by [a few reputable bitcoin developers]( If BIP148 is implemented successfully over enough "economic nodes" (people who spend/receive bitcoin and also operate full nodes) and mining nodes, then other mining node operators will be incentivized to also implement SegWit.

I hope my analogy highlighted the fact that adding highway capacity (blocksize) can only be a temporary fix for the hordes of transactions that may flood in from walkways (cash) and trains (fiat). I don't fundamentally disagree that blocksize increases should be avoided at all costs. Rather, I see wormhole gateways (lightning network) are clearly a huge improvement (unlimited microtransactions with no roadway needed) over roads but come with their own quirky limitations (require the roadway to initialize and finalize, cannot transfer unlimited amounts in a single direction without a return flow occuring). I also hope I highlighted why toll-collecting highway maintenance companies (miners) would want to prevent wormhole gateways from cannibalizing their industry.
To me, it's the same business idea of [market cannibalism]( "Cannibalize your own market with a better product you control before a competitor eats up the entire market with their own better product."

In my attempt to read between the lines, I think Mr. Ferrara prefers physical metal to be currency because bitcoin is too volatile and subject to larger swings in perceived value. The physical transfer rate of metals is limited by physics. Therefore, when metal value increases, the fact that everyone mostly trades in metal-redeeming-certificates means further increases in value mean buyers agree to trust the actually physical holders of the redeemable metal. It is a system that requires trust in not only the protocol of metal-redeeming-certificates but in the guardians of physical metals to defend their stores from theft. 
During increases of the value of a metal, buyers of that metal are disincentivized to buy large amounts of metal via metal-redeeming-certificates since they would be "putting all their eggs in one basket" (with the basket being the metal-trading market). At some point, the value of metal becomes so high that violently invading metal storehouses (the "baskets") becomes cost-effective. The threat of metal theft (which increases as metals rise in value) is what keeps metal values from skyrocketing (and consequently plummeting as thefts occur and metal storehouses lose user trust).
Therefore, only wealthy metal buyers who can afford to build strong physical fortresses to defend their redeemed metal end up with the most security in the protocol. However, even these fortress-owning metal buyers are subject to sudden decreases in their metal value in the event of large metal discoveries (asteroid mining).
I have skipped over a lot of assumptions in the narrative I wrote in the previous paragraph which I'll now state here:
1. Metals are subject to physical laws and therefore cannot be easily transferred across all of human civilization
2. Because of these physical limitations, a system of trade that stipulates physical metal be used means certificates of metal ownership (not the metal itself) will be the vehicle for most exchanges of value
3. Communication across human civilization is effectively instantaneous and free for metal traders.
4. Encrypted digital metal-redeeming-certificates constitute the main form of value transfer between metal holders and certificate-bearers.
5. Secure physical storage, retrieval, and transfer of metals is difficult.
6. Metal buyers will buy less metal certificates if the cost of physically stealing the metal from the certificate-issuer becomes less than the value of the certificate-issuer's stored metal. (How metal buyers can evaluate the cost of achieving security for certificate-issuers' metal storehouses is beyond the scope of this Reddit comment).
tl;dr Metal value is less volatile than bitcoin because the threat of large decreases in metal value due to physical metal theft dampens value increases from careful metal buyers.

There still will be a UTXO but it will be the one jointly controlled by the Exchange and the Newbie's Lightning Protocol client. It is the UTXO that defines the initial state and terms of the multisig transaction in Step 2. As long as the Exchange remains online and actively conducting LN transactions to and from the Newbie, the Newbie need not worry about paying blockchain transaction fees.
Ultimately there will have to be a final second blockchain transaction fee but only when the channel closes.
So, if you can find a long-lived honest LN node, you need only pay two blockchain transaction fees. A nice improvement over the current state of affairs.

Miners can decide what transaction records they want to include in candidate blocks that they hash. As more and more people join the bitcoin network and regularly begin sending transaction requests, there needs to be a disincentive to flooding bitcoin nodes with micro transactions of negligible value (lots of 0.00001 BTC transactions).
One way to do this is to voluntarily include a transaction fee along with the BTC amoint yoi are sending in your transaction request. The bitcoin miner who processes your bitcoin transaction will also receive the transaction fee you voluntarily included when you made the transaction request (I think the default fee on the bitcoin-qt client is 0.005BTC, I believe). This gives miners incentive to process transactions that have high transaction fees attached them. I think it's possible to set up your bitcoin mining program to include only high BTC transactions in any block it attempts to hash. Since there are size limits on block sizes (I am at work so you'll have to check the bitcoin wiki to confirm this), it would be advantageous for a miner to prefer processing high fee transactions. 
Also, when the bitcoin reward for generating a new block becomes negligible in value (although it is 25 BTC now, it will halve after every 4 years), transaction fees will become the main incentive for miners to continue processing transactions in the far future.
Again, for those of you who know more than me,  correct me if I got any details wrong
**TL;DR: transaction fees are how you pay the miner who includes your transaction in blocks they add to the blockchain.**

If you invested in everything that claimed to be the future without investigating its rules and nature, then you would likely have lost all your money way before you ever even had a chance to investigate bitcoin. You only have a limited number of hours in your life to explore and understand things. Don't beat yourself up for not discovering the good properties of this one thing that started only in 2009. There are still many things yet to discover for careful explorers. The derring-dos of rash explorers often get them killed.

I believe in the way Gavin explained it, Ultra would not be able to spend Alice or Bob's bitcoins since Ultra never has Alice or Bob's private keys. Like you said, though, it is possible for those bitcoins to be lost if Ultra is shutdown, though, and Ultra's private keys are destroyed. Perhaps this could be solved if Ultra could regularly sign "deadman transactions" that refunded everyone's coins to their original owners if the transaction were not renewed with some kind of signed extension.
I guess it's ultimately a question of sacrificing decentralization in order to increase the transaction rate. If only Internet bandwidth increased so synchronizing even a TB-sized blockchain inflated with microtransactions were not an issue.

**TL;DR: So you're saying bitcoins can prevent banks going loan-crazy with depositors' cash by allowing depositors to instead secure their money in a bitcoin wallet?**
Here is what I understand from your post:
1. People deposit money that they earn into banks for safekeeping (presumably as a better alternative to having cash laying around).
2. Banks free up that deposited cash by loaning it out to other people. It's common for banks to loan up to 97% of cash that people deposit into the bank.
3. The "velocity of money" is how fast money is spent (I'm guessing its proportional to the amount of money that doesn't sit dormant for long periods of time, such as under someone's mattress).
4. If enough people default on bank loans at any one time, the bank is unable to pay its depositors the money they promised to hold on to them. If the banks can't get enough loans to pay back their depositors, they go bankrupt.
5. Banks going broke causes banks to lower the percentage of deposited money that they loan out (or, presumably, increase the loan interest rates). This makes it more difficult for businesses to get loans to do business while staying profitable.
6. Businesses spend less money, less money is deposited into banks.
7. Businesses begin to go bankrupt since they can no longer get the cheap loans that they once had from banks. They default on loans that had taken from banks. This causes even more banks to go broke.
8. Somehow gold is unable to compensate (in value? in physical amounts?) for a sudden change of deposits/money-people-think-they-have, aka "M2 currency base" (**I'm still very unclear on this point.**)
9. "It causes a change in currency that is not correlated to productivity." (**I'm still confused. What is "It"? What is the nature of the "change"?**)
10. "Thus the boom bust cycle" (**You've already lost me in steps 8 and 9.**)
11. "Non-commodity currencies" (bills and coins minted by the Federal Reserve) are created to compensate for a change in "M1" currency (presumably bills and coins). 
11. "Unfortunately this debases savings of everyone, means banks cant fail and take big risks" (**You've lost me with another leap of logic.**)
I was not an Econ major in college so I'm not familiar with terms such as "M1", "M2", "M3". Also, I can't clearly see how "currencies not being correlated with productivity" fits into your argument. It's not that I disagree with you, but I don't clearly understand what your argument is in order to be able to confidently agree/disagree with you.
At the end, I think you are saying that Bitcoins may be able to prevent the problems associated with depositing money into banks (who will profit from the currency you give them by loaning most of it out). People can choose to safeguard their money in a secure Bitcoin wallet instead of a bank. In other words, since the main reason people give banks their money is to safeguard that money... why not bypass banks entirely and use a secure bitcoin wallet instead?
Here are my thoughts:
* I would argue that currency fluctuations would still remain a problem.
* What is to prevent a bitcoin bank to begin accepting deposits of bitcoin and loaning out large amounts of bitcoin to businesses as before? If such a bitcoin bank promised 10% annual interest on deposits (or whatever percentage is needed to stay ahead of general bitcoin deflation), then I imagine many people would send their bitcoins to that bank in order to get a share of the bank's profits.
As I write this, I'm realizing that bitcoin banks would realize they cannot rely on government bailouts or cheap treasury loans. Bitcoin banks that loaned out large percentages of deposited bitcoins would face much higher risks (than US banks with access to low-interest US treasury loans) since there is no bailout option with bitcoins. The first generation of bitcoin banks will probably experience several failures until they learn just how conservative you have to be with no "bitcoin treasury". Therefore, bitcoin banks would be perceived as risky places to deposit your money in comparison to the option of storing your bitcoins in a secure wallet that you control.

My guess is he is thinking of how TCP/IP fundamentally differed from previous communication methods. Before the Internet protocols we use today were designed, all phone calls and data transmissions basically required dedicated conductive paths that could only allow two parties to exchange data at a time. There were no routing tables or packets. Data you sent (phone calls, faxes) was guaranteed by central authorities (AT&amp;T, etc) to arrive at its destination because you essentially paid the authority to construct a dedicated conductive path from you to your destination each time you dialed a number. Wiretapping was trivial.
With the Internet we use, there is no guarantee that data you send will get to its destination. You don't have a dedicated copper wire running from me to you. Packets get lost. TCP allows for you to verify data accuracy by resending missing packets. The main benefit to TCP/IP is that it allows the data transmission infrastructure to be decentralized. The Internet, as a result, has no single point of failure. Transmitted data will find paths around malfunctioning routers or broken/sabotaged connections.
Bitcoin, like TCP/IP, has mechanisms for verifying that data sent across it (bitcoin transactions) actually was received at the destination (analyzing the blockchain). However, these verification mechanisms don't require a central authority to guarantee that each and every single cent is sent on the first transmission. Data transmission is cheap. Transaction verification time is "good enough". It's not guaranteed by a corporation. It's made reliable by cryptography and being decentralized. Transactions can still propagate around disabled sections of the network just like TCP packets.
Feel free to correct any mistakes in what I said. Most of what I know about the advantages of TCP or UDP protocols I learned while listening to the Security Now! podcast by Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte.

An analogy that comes to mind: the blockchain (layer 1) is like a traditional highway system. Lightning Network (layer 2) is like a system of wormhole gateway pairs that allow instantaneous teleportation between any gateway pair with the primary limitation being that you cannot send gateways through a wormhole; they must be carted along an old-fashioned highway. The gateways are free to make while highways cost money to lay down and secure. 
People used to footpaths (in-person cash) and state-controlled fixed-schedule surveiled expensive railway networks (fiat currency) are super stoked about a highway network where you can drive your own vehicle anywhere so long as you pay a small demand-based toll to the road maintainers (miners). The highway system is very complicated so you have to either maintain your own navigation computer (a full node) or let someone else drive your vehicle and trust their maps (coinbase, SPV servers).
More highways could be added to the system accommodate the increasing demand from converts from the old railway system but every increase in highway capacity requires your navigation computer to need a bigger and more expensive hard drive. Most people are happy to take busses controlled by large corporations who either charge fees or sell their passengers' information to offset the cost of their navigation computers. It's very similar to the old state railway system but it is initially much cheaper.
Now as the highway network is becoming crowded, the highway tolls are starting to climb since they are demand-based. Highway maintenance companies (miners) are eager for more highways to be added so they can collect more tolls from more people even if it causes the cost of navigation computers to rise. Most commuters don't care about navigation computers since they trust corporation-controlled busses to carry them; it's simpler for them and they are used to trusting The Powers That Be.
A small minority of scientists have discovered wormhole gateway technology (Lightning Network) but need a few years for engineers to refine the technology so it is safe and user-friendly. In the meantime scientists are asking interested highway maintainers to improve the road system with retrofits to accommodate the special vehicle dimensions required to hold a gateway (SegWit). Many highway maintainers refuse but offer a compromise: they insist that a guaranteed doubling of highway capacity be added no matter what and they insist on maintaining veto power against the wormhole retrofits if 20% of them disagree with the upgrade (the NY agreement).
A small but vocal group of navigation computer owners concerned about the potential for skyrocketing costs for them think highway maintainers maintaining veto power against wormhole gateways is bullshit and want to start building roadways that are wormhole gateway compatible immediately (BIP148).  The wormhole tech isn't polished yet (it works in labs with skilled technicians, but user friendly UI is not ready). The large fraction of highway maintainers (miners) insisting on holding the power to deny passage to wormhole gateways (lightning network) is a huge conflict of interest.
This is a hugely simplified analogy that caricaturizes miners, users, and BIP148, but I think it's more understandable to most newcomers to Bitcoin.

Third reason (a very selfish one): spending and receiving bitcoin with a full node means you only recognize transactions and blocks that follow the rules **you** agree with. Those rules include:
1. only 21 million BTC. No endless inflation.
2. all bitcoins are fungible
3. past transactions cannot be reversed
4. no trusted authorities need approve your transactions
5. network nodes need only add 1 MB every 10 minutes (144 MB/day) of blockchain storage
If you can afford equipment for rule number 5 then you can set up a node to verify that the digital economy in which you are participating follows rules 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
If you **can't** afford equipment for rule number 5 then your opinion about rules 1 - 4 no longer matters. You are now trusting others to run a full node for you. **You're back at square one** trusting central authorities like banks and the Federal Reserve.

A port is like a mailbox in a post office. The computer makes a trip to the post office every second. An "open port" means the computer told the post office to keep mail that arrives in that mailbox (or "port"). If a port (aka mailbox) isn't open (the computer hasn't told the post office to save mail in that mailbox) then the post office throws messages to that port away. When the computer visits the post office, she looks inside every "open" port for new messages. Other computers only send messages to certain port numbers because it helps keep the incoming mail organized. 
This all would require your kid to have a vague idea of how mail works. Maybe a trip to the post office is in order?

When I try to play devil's advocate my cynical side is saying this idea is just a needlessly complicated way to define a set of "authorized" nodes (basically, proof-of-stake) and to record their identities for the purposes of Big Brother tracking. A few problems come to mind:
1. How do individual nodes define a "legitimate node"? A node that has paid the participation fee? I think that's probably the simplest method.
2. How would the protocol identify the starting and ending node if an attacker spins up a ridiculously high number of nodes? Again, only use nodes that have paid the participation fee.
3. What's to prevent attackers to spam the network with false network connecvitiy information? My response is to ask you how do routers on the internet determine the fastest route? What are the vulnerabilities to routing protocols?
I'm not a network engineer, I'm a chemical engineer who has a hobby of [fitting song lyrics to Eve Online star system routes]( There might be a simple fundamental limitation that prevents this so I welcome criticism (preferably in a language I can understand).
After some thinking this afternoon (I actually created a reddit post with more ideas but deleted it because I didn't think I adequately explained things), I have some thoughts on virtual network attacks:
The potential vulnerability of spinning up nonexistent sections of the network might not be an issue if one of the primary route requirements is low ping time since artificially inducing high ping times in virtual network nodes can only increase ping times from physical limits, not decrease them. The laws of physics would have to be relied upon to enforce causality, which, if it weren't the case, would mean we'd have larger issues to deal with than just securing decentralized payment systems. Also, just like how [demasking attacks on the Tor network require attackers to control a large number of exit nodes]( connecting a virtual network to facilitate your own nodes to identify routes faster than honest routes would require installing a lot of unique connections to the real network in order to both track where routes start and end and to obfuscate genuinely fast routes through honest nodes. The main advantage honest nodes would have is that a single fast route would be all that it'd take to bypass a virtual network (which may be slowed by the overhead required by whatever operating system or equipment in which it is running). I imagine a successful attack would require fooling whatever routing protocol honest nodes use into thinking that such a low ping time route exists.
The idea of using the traveling salesman problem is a bit romantic so I don't want to become too enamored about trying to force it into a proof-of-work. I have the feeling that there are more possible ways to create a proof-of-work if you can manage to create a decentralized protocol that defines a list of network nodes. The proof-of-work for finding the shortest route for a randomly selected set of nodes, though, would have to be made in such a way that the *current* network topology being routed through is not known to any given node. If the topology were defined and known from the beginning, then bruteforce computation could be used by a single node to calculate and then publish the fastest route. Then instead of SHA256 ASICs, you'd have routing ASICs. The network topology has to change in an unpredicable way. I imagine currently unimportant but verifiable properties of nodes would have to be used as entropy sources; possibilities that come into mind are:
1. The timestamp of transactions confirmed in the blockchain and broadcast by which particular node (this would mean transactions in the blockchain would also have to include a broadcast node ID, degrading anonymity).
2. The last block from which a given node collected a coinbase reward. If this proof-of-route (is that a term?) method, if successful, would make it much more probable that well-connected nodes on fast routes would successfully publish blocks.
3. The last block in which a node was included in a PoW route.
4. The number of peers a node has under a given ping time.
A note about how this randomness would be used. Earlier, I said "the shortest route for a randomly selected set of nodes". I really meant that candidate routes through the network must be deterministically generated using the most-recent block data as input. This is the idea that I had while thinking about how to generate route-songs in Eve Online star systems. Given a song and a star map (here is [The Forge]( for example) how can you create a route of star systems such that you can easily sing the route to the [meter]( of the song? The relevant property of the stars (nodes) in the stargate network is simply the number of syllables in the star's name. If you gave me the song "Jingle Bells", then I could construct many routes through the Eve Online stargate network. However, it wouldn't be possible to start a Jingle Bells route song in many star systems because the stars are too isolated (not enough possible syllable combinations) or no combination of adjacent star system names fit neatly within the song meter.  For example, the sequence of the connected star systems [Saatuban]( [Piekura](  [Mara]( and [Dantumi]( are a valid stargate route in the [Lonetrek region]( and also have names that can be pleasantly sung to the first line of the [Jingle Bells]( chorus:
    Saa-tu- ban,   Pie-ku- ra,    Ma- ra,    Dan-tu- mi
    Jin-gle bells, jin-gle bells, jin-gle    all the way
    ♪   ♪   ♪      ♪   ♪   ♪      ♪   ♪      ♪   ♪   ♪;
I made that just now by looking at starmaps for a few minutes and trying different routes manually until one sounded pleasant.
In a similar way, I imagine a hash of the previous block could act as a song, so to speak, and be used to generate possible routes through the network. However, a node couldn't accelerate the process of determining an optimal route before broadcasting the route unless it knew the exact state of all node properties (that would be later encoded into a network map history which could be used for future verification). There is a potential problem with nodes spamming the network with possible routes but they might be mitigated by requiring a cost of bitcoin to be paid to publish a route. I feel like these latest thoughts are pushing my idea towards simply "proof-of-stake with extra steps". I need to think more about it.

The way I see it, there are 3 solutions (in order of increasing difficulty):
1. Run a bitcoin node on your wifi network that can relay customer transactions to the wider bitcoin network. Get customers to push transactions to your node first. You still have to expect customers to transmit their signed transaction on their own.
2. Require your customers to use a bitcoin client that supports off-the-blockchain transactions. Puts responsibility on customers again, but vendors have to push back on customers in some way.
3. Develop or find/implement a bitcoin client for customers that can display a signed transaction in a QR-code format (or similar). Then, make available a POS QR-code reader that can grab signed transactions, verify them, inform the teller of validity, and then send transaction to the greater bitcoin network. This eliminates the need for customers to have good wifi connectivity and gives the vendor an expectation of swiftly receiving signed transactions from customers.
4. Convince local wireless service providers to offer better coverage in your area.
**TL;DR**: the main problem is getting signed transactions (&lt;1KB?) from the customer to the greater bitcoin network. Here are some ideas

Bitcoin will probably be acceptable for colonies within the radius of Neptune's orbit.

[](/a23) Yes. However, this isn't a problem since if bitcoins became scarce while bitcoin demand remained high, it wouldn't be hard to justify extending the number of decimal places that each bitcoin can have.
Right now, the smallest unit of bitcoin recognized by the bitcoin client is 0.00000001 BTC (aka "1 satoshi"). If bitcoin miners can come to a consensus, they could all switch to an updated bitcoin client that could add another few zeros to that small decimal (i.e. "0.0000000000000001 BTC").
Instead of printing new bitcoins, we can just all agree to use smaller and smaller denominations of old bitcoins. This way, you aren't penalized for using bitcoin as a savings account by money-printing (as happens with the US dollar).

Something called "[Public key cryptography]( allows Sam's and Robert's identities to remain anonymous. The amount of bitcoins being sent is public.
1. Bitcoin "miners" grab a group of pending transactions (hopefully including Sam and Robert's transaction) and begin hashing (see "[SHA-256]( them together with the last officially verified group of transactions (a "block") with small variations. Sam can increase the chances his transaction is included in a miner's block by including a small transaction fee which will be awarded to a lucky miner who constructs a new block with a special property (see next step).
1. The miners keep trying different hashes until one miner (let's call her Mary) produces a hash that has a very special property: the hash result contains a long continuous string of zeros. It is rare for a hash to have long strings of zeros. Figuring out how to get the hash to output long strings of zeros is the "mathematical puzzle" that people talk about. 
1. Then, Mary tells every other miner in the network the details of how exactly she produced her difficult-to-discover hash. These details are simple to explain (but very hard to discover in the first place) and the other miners can confirm her work very quickly.
1. Once the miners successfully verify Mary's work, they all begin downloading and sharing the data she hashed and label it as the next block in the blockchain.
1. All transactions Mary included in this block are now encoded into the block chain. The updated blockchain is transmitted to every person in the Bitcoin network.
1. As a reward for her work, Mary gets to award herself 25 bitcoins (plus all the transaction fees associated with the transactions she included in her block) as the first transaction of the next block that all the other miners then begin constructing (which they begin hashing together with the block Mary just generated).
1. Robert's bitcoin wallet program downloads the block Mary created and discovers Robert's bitcoin address tucked inside along with data proving (using public key cryptography) that he had received 1.0 bitcoins from an address (Sam's) that had 1.0 bitcoins.
1. If Robert wanted to send his bitcoins to you, all your bitcoin wallet program would have to do in order to verify that Robert indeed had 1.0 bitcoins to spend would be to check Robert's bitcoin address against the public transaction history (the block chain every wallet keeps a copy of) to trace the history of those bitcoins all the way back to when those bitcoins were first created by some lucky miner long ago.
1. Now Sam can no longer send those 1.0 bitcoins to anyone else. The public record proves Sam no longer has those 1.0 bitcoins. If Sam broadcasts a new transaction citing those same 1.0 bitcoins he gave to Robert, miners (equipped with the public transaction history) will detect the fraud attempt and drop Sam's fraudulent transaction.
 summary:
Miners act as accountants who continuously verify the integrity of a public record of all bitcoin transactions that have ever been made. Each addition to the public transaction record is called a "block". Miners verify the public transaction record ("block chain") by continuously hashing candidate blocks with the most-recently-proved block until a lucky miner's candidate block is found to have a special property. A candidate block is special if it produces a hash with a long continuous string of zeros when combined and hashed with the most-recently-proved block. As a reward for securely extending the block chain (which is literally the public transaction record of all bitcoins), miners get a bounty of new bitcoins (an amount that is halved every four years) plus any transaction fees associated with transactions they had included in special blocks they construct. Everyone has access to this public transaction record and can prove who has how much money (using bitcoin addresses which people can choose to keep anonymous).
Addendum: 
In order to control the rate at which new blocks are discovered (and therefore how quickly bitcoins are generated by miners), the bitcoin program that miners use automatically adjusts the number of zeros required for a hash to be considered "special" so that the rate at which new blocks are discovered (a function of how many miners there are and how fast their computers can calculate hashes) is constant.

This is my understanding of what you are proposing (correct me if I'm wrong):
The idea is to have "adoption-first" group (i.e. big blockers) and "decentralization-first" (i.e. Segwit supporters) group agree to turn the existing single blockchain into two parallel blockchains but without bitcoin token duplication. Using the drivechain idea, the "adoption-first" group would *specify a split date upon which they would* send their bitcoins to an exit address on Chain A and then only spend bitcoins on Chain B.  For the "decentralization-first" group, they may continue to use bitcoin as before. ~~At a later date,~~ *Prior to the split date* drivechain-compatibility ~~could~~ *would* be added by consensus agreement by Chain A nodes so that members of the "adoption-first" group could release their bitcoins onto Chain A again.
Now, the "adoption-first" group can deploy straightforward blocksize increases they would like on Chain B to accelerate adoption with users immediately and possibly never decide to reunite with Chain A again.
Likewise, the "decentralization-first" group can continue deploying SegWit, Schnorr signatures, Lightning Network, and other decentralization-friendly optimizations onto Chain A. Big blocker advocates can be encouraged to join Chain B. ~~At a later date, developers for Chain A can add drivechain support so that~~ Chain B users can unlock their bitcoins on Chain A *at any time*, if they so choose *and visa versa*.
I'm curious to hear people's ideas on how such a sidechain arrangement could be made an attractive fall-back plan for the "adoption-first" group, especially given the relative simplicity of permitting bitcoin tokens to be duplicated on two blockchains after a hard fork (no need for an exit or reverse migration plan, which is what drivechain seems to facilitate).
This is a snippet of [an article]( about drivechain that I read before I tried to put this summary together:

I've been regretting posting that last paragraph all day today. I said that bitcoin is helping to accelerate the trading of information across the globe, which indirectly benefits populations whose culture doesn't promote technological innovation.




No, that's not what I intended to convey and the problem is probably the result of me furiously tapping out that post before my morning commute.
 [](/a08) [](/sp) 
If I had to boil down what I'm trying to say into two sentences, I'd say: Nation-states that promoted wage-earning cultures (specialized workers + entrepreneurs + market capitalism) are more likely to discover increased production through innovation than was typically seen in tribute-taking societies (Mayans, Sumerians, Ming Dynasty) where production increases came from conquest. Bitcoin has the potential to eliminate the tribute-taking attributes of nation-states today by reducing trade barriers between markets put up by nation-states.
Also, when I say "*tribute-taking societies*", I mean societies where there is a military-backed ruling class that despises merchants, promotes warriors, and is fed by tribute collected from peasants (who are self-sufficient, technically unspecialized, and don't have a say in how much tribute is extorted from them).
When I say "*wage-earning cultures*", I mean cultures where workers learn specialized skills in order to sell their labor on a free market for money.
 
 [](/c21) [](/sp)
I brought up the Song dynasty because it was an early outlier in terms of [capitalistic and entrepreneurial tendencies]( The benefits of capitalism in China during this time were [advances in rice-production, discovery of gunpowder, printing, metallurgy]( In short, since merchants and trade were respected by government, peasants actually had some incentive to discover more productive means of agriculture. In contrast, [peasants in previous eras had tribute extorted out of them from threat of force]( and [merchants were heavily taxed](  If only the Song had access to a global market (India, Afroeurasia, Americas), then they might have grown strong enough to repel attacks by the mongols (who eventually conquered them). I thought the fall of the Song dynasty was relevant since the subsequent Ming dynasty lacked the innovation and technological progress that was seen in the Song dynasty. Granted, the Ming dynasty was established in the ashes of the Song dynasty ([which ended when Kublai Khan finally conquered it and established the short-lived Yuan dynasty]( But [the absolute monarchy and strong central government/military established in the Yuan dynasty persisted in the Ming dynasty](
 [](/c11) [](/sp)
It makes me want to draw parallels between the Song/Ming dynasties and the United States / Western Europe. Aren't most limitations on international banking in place to hinder guerrilla warriors from purchasing weapons? I'm fairly certain the United States' eradication of native american nomadic populations was executed in order to preempt any future uprising against future US citizens. I believe US military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has been justified on the basis of removing unpredictable participants in the global oil market (even if crude oil sales to the US from the middle east is small). In these examples, military strength and intelligence is being used to secure the global market from disruption. However, with the Ming dynasty, the [military strength]( needed to [maintain stability]( was so great that the required government centralization [prevented the free-market innovation such as had occurred in the Song dynasty]( Military strength is amplified by centralization but centralization restricts growth from free-market innovations in productive activities (agriculture for Song dynasty, manufacturing for modern globalization). 
 [](/a08) [](/sp)
**What I'm getting at is: historically, free markets have required military action in order to prevent being conquered by tribute-taking societies** (ex: Song dynasty's fall to Kublai Khan's mongol armies). If Bitcoin-use becomes ubiquitous and users stop paying income tax to their host nation-states, who will defend those users from attacks by aggressive bitcoin-empowered guerillas? Multinational corporations? Multinational corporations (who already seem adept at avoiding taxes) stand to benefit the most from using Bitcoin to transfer their wealth around the globe. Since existing multinational corporations require markets to sell their stuff, they would have an interest in maintaining the market stability (presumably through some kind of military). And since the most innovative entrepreneurs appear in free markets, the most competitive of these corporations would inherit the nation-states' task of balancing military power with personal freedoms. The internet and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are strong forces for decentralization but also require high levels of technology to maintain (semiconductor fabs, plastics, cryogenic gas separation, metallurgy, fiber optics, signal processing). Therefore, a stable future with bitcoin must also preserve these industries in some form even if nation-states dissolve. **What I want to know is: in a decentralized world, how will the facilities that comprise these industries be secured from physical attacks? Who will be doing the securing?**

Before the pattern of wage-earning that is prevelant today, unspecialized (read: general-skilled) peasants toiling for tribute-takers (read: military-backed nobles) was the norm. Peasants had little incentive to innovate since any extra production they made was gobbled up by tribute-takers. Tribute-takers had little incentive to fund innovation since it was far easier to boost production by just conquering nearby lands and acquiring control of that land's peasants/slaves.
Today, in contrast, you see wage-earning instead of tribute-taking mentality. Wage-earners have an incentive to boost their own production since most modern states allow them to keep most money they earn. Taxing governments have an incentive to boost production since it's common to see major investments turn into increased production within only a few years (whereas in the past this investment/production lag could take generations). Also, I find it hard to imagine entrepreneurship appearing in a tribute-taking society. Entrepreneurs are the backbone of innovation. I think this is one reason why governments don't overtax employed. To do so would mean specialized wage-earners would have little incentive to advance into the field of entrepreneurship.
So, really, if a modern government decided to turn towards tribute-taking instead of allowing wage-earning culture to continue, then innovation would stall as entrepreneurs disappeared from the workers being governed.
The Song dynasty was an early example of entrepreneurship appearing in human societies (merchants, specialized artisans, large complex cities). However, if what I recall from my history book is correct, Kublai Khan's nomadic warriors forced the chinese government to centralize in order to combat the threat. The subsequent Ming dynasty was so centralized that it was able to revert to time-tested tribute-taking instead of promoting specialized wage-earning.
Bitcoin may actually promote tribute-taking states indirectly since increased rates of information transfer (via public patents, reverse-engineering, stolen company secrets) make it possible for tribute-taking states to receive the benefits of production-increasing innovations without the cost of funding those innovations or even tolerating the entrepreneurial cultures that generated those innovations. Why would North Korea invest in a cure for cancer when it could just wait for the US/Europe to develop it, and then force the US/Europe to give up their technology by taking a few hostages or threatening to nuke South Korea again?

What I imagined went through the head of the FinCEN regulator who said miners should register as money transmitters:
"The reason bitcoin mining organizations need to register themselves as money transmitters is because they create money. If the US government does not impose regulations on money creation, then malicious bitcoin mining organizations could destabilize the bitcoin economy. Therefore, to protect US citizens from fluctuations of this new currency, the US government needs to measure and control the rate of money creation."
My feeling is FinCEN doesn't appreciate just how simple the bitcoin system is. No huge "institutions" or "organizations" are needed to verify transactions. All that work is done with a handful of programs that can run on any consumer-grade computer made within the past 10 years.
Also, I don't think FinCEN trusts or understands that bitcoin is already configured to control its own money supply. The only reason I can imagine why you would want miners to be registered as money transmitters is so FinCEN could figure out how to turn them into copies of the US Treasury and subject the miners to rules that regulate how fast they "make" bitcoins. I don't think they appreciate that the rate of bitcoin creation with respect to time is constant, no matter what rules/regulations you impose on portions of the network.
If FinCEN were really serious about controlling the bitcoin network they would ask the NSA to send them copies of all bitcoin transactions being exchanged across the Internet, subpeona the identities of bitcoin address owners from Coinbase, Mt. Gox, CampBX, etc and track who is in possession of tainted coins (bitcoins recently associated with criminal bitcoin owners). Then, they could threaten to seize the traditional bank accounts of any business that accepts bitcoin as payment until the business obeys anti-money-laundering/know-your-customer laws. Then, once enough evidence has been gathered about criminal transactions (facilitated by evidence provided with bitcoin's own block chain), the developers of the bitcoin protocol could be prosecuted for assisting criminal activity.

I think the main thing to be learned is that increased block propogation speed throughout the network can be used to nullify the computational power of miners who are not as well-connected as you. Also, holding off on releasing your newly discovered block seems to be the new mining strategy that every miner should adopt.
I imagine the effect of this will that **new blocks will appear in clusters instead of spaced out** (this could raised the median confirmation time significantly). If multiple new blocks appear on the network at the same time (assuming low block propagation time), this means a lot more computational power will be used to maintain forks that ultimately will not survive
Also, if most miners begin adopting this strategy (let's call them greedy miners), the vanilla miners who  immediately release their blocks will face increased difficulty as greedy miners attach their private forks (possibly consisting of multiple sequential blocks) to the blockchain. The average block discovery rate may be constant (since it's only calculated every 2 weeks) but I could see there be many periods &gt;&gt;10 minutes where greedy miners are busy hashing away on private forks while honest miners are slowed by the higher difficulty.
Edit:If I have misinterpreted any aspect of mining and difficulty calculations, please correct me.

What methods are available to convert electricity from wind/hydroelectric/solar sources into liquid hydrocarbon? Using wind/solar/hydroelectric power sources to reduce the carbon in CO2 into hydrocarbon is something I've wanted to see progress on for a while now. From what I understand of microbiology, bacteria have all the cellular machinery to perform all the steps required to use electrical current to reduce CO2 into hydrocarbon. It's just a matter of creating natural selection pressure that increases the conversion efficiency. How do you trigger bacteria to delay reproduction in favor of reducing CO2 into hydrocarbon? Might it be easier to just batch-grow bunch of bacteria with the proteins necessary for the CO2-conversion and then fix the proteins onto a surface within a controlled reactor?
edit: I like the idea of decentralizing power-production. Traditional nuclear power is on the far centralized end of the spectrum with solar panels and algae bags on the far decentralized end of the spectrum. But now that I'm thinking about it, technologies that enable decentralized power distribution (electricity -&gt; biofuel) will also probably increase the versatility of traditional centralized methods. I imagine a nuclear power plant with a hydrocarbon-production unit using fission-derived power might be a viable way to mass-produce liquid fuel when fossil fuels run out (and thus centralize liquid fuels at a higher efficiency than a decentralized method).

[From what I've read]( the two miners' blocks would both be considered valid by the miners they are connected to. At that point, the block chain forks and the possibility of double-spending becomes a possibility. Eventually, as miners add new blocks to both chains (each miner is not guaranteed to know of the alternate fork), one chain becomes longer ([the wiki says "length" is determined by the combined difficulty of these blocks]( I imagine that is the combined quantity of leading zeros across blocks since the chain fork) than the other. As more and more miners become aware of the longer chain, they choose to add to the longer chain. Eventually, the shorter chain is abandoned by the majority of miners and its blocks become orphaned. The orphaned blocks' transactions are considered invalid and are readded to the list of pending transactions for reintegration into the longer chain.
[From what I'm reading in the bitcoin wiki, each individual bitcoin client (the wallet program I referred to in my big long post) doesn't consider a transaction as confirmed until it is buried 100-blocks-deep into the block chain that it recognizes.]( That means that a miner could potentially add a block but be denied their 25 bitcoin bounty if the block they contributed ends up becoming an orphan.
From what I've read, the 100-block requirement for confirmation of a transaction is just a safety precaution. If you are a vendor, you could immediately take the appearance of the transaction in a single block as "good enough" and transfer your product (perhaps access to a file download). The benefit you gain from accepting 1-block confirmations is a very fast transaction. However, your transaction would become invalid if the coincidence you talk of occurred. Another potential cause of these forks is if a group of miners with access to very large amounts of computational power colluded to cause a fork simply by being able to churn out blocks to keep an orphaned chain alive long enough to confuse confuse nearby miners. I think that's why people get nervous about the BTC Guild having so much organized processing power. The faster your computers can churn out blocks the higher your chances of manipulating the bitcoin network for [personal gain](
Of course, if someone figured out how to get [a quantum computer]( to churn out blocks willy-nilly, Bitcoin is doomed.

Which means it would hve been better to buy bitcoin directly instead of buying mining equipment (or I keep seeing on these forums).
Therefore (assuming that at least some mining equipment buyers have done their homework on proftability) some miners will sell their bitcoins at inflated prices, touting the bitcoins' lack of transaction history as their selling point. Buying hardware and mining coins would be a very roundabout way of money laundering, but freshly mined coins have more value (especially when tracking "tainted" coins catches on).
There are probably other reasons why people mine bitcoins (amusement, study). But I can't imagine amusement and tech enthusiasm alone will last for the long-run (4+ years).

How exactly is a random key pair selected, though? If it turned out that the pseudorandom method for selecting a key pair were not random (but instead were relying on a date/time) then the space you'd have to search in key-pair-land would be much smaller, right?
For example, the other day, I saw a youtube video of a guy demonstrating a key-pair generator using a breadboard, some logic chips, and an Arduino. If, for example, he were using an analog temperature sensor to generate the random numbers used for key-pair generation, if that sensor failed and only gave out a single number, his custom-made circuit would be vulnerable to shelling out the same key-pair every time it ran, right? 
I'd like to make sure that popular key-pair generating programs introduce randomness properly so we can take credit for the entire key-pair space instead of just some small fraction.

Transactions contained within blocks created in a hypothetical Syrian fork would be considered "orphaned" when Syrian nodes are reconnected to the larger network. Orphaned transactions would then be added to the queue of pending transactions of the greater network (provided the transactions don't cite coins already spent in the larger network after the Syrian fork began).
This all could be avoided if a single node had some way of acquiring new blocks generated from outside.
Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I think a single laptop smuggled into Syria (say, 1 week after a hypothetical Internet cutoff) would cause all bitcoin miners within Syria (miners which had lost all communication with the greater bitcoin network) to recognize the newer blocks contained within the smuggled laptop's bitcoin-qt client. You could prevent slower double spend attempts if you could exchange blockchain updates in this manual fashion. Admittedly, if you only can manage blockchain smuggling runs only once every week, then a double-spend could still be executed if both transactions in the double-spend (one made inside Syria, the other made outside of Syria) could be coordinated so both transactions are integrated into blocks within 1 week of each other. A 1-week blockchain update schedule would mean a double-spender in Syria (who can still communicate across the Syrian border to have someone outside of Syria spend her coins) would have only a week to offload her coins onto someone else before her scheme were thwarted by the smuggled blockchain update. One viable means of offloading coins quickly in exchange for local valuables would be to sell double-spent bitcoins at only a fraction of the current exchange rate to buyers in Syria.
Overall, the higher the blockchain update frequency between isolated/distant sections of the bitcoin network, the harder it is to conduct double-spend attacks. Blockchain updates need not always require a continuous Internet connection.
**tl;dr: They get reprocessed. Isolated miners can still get updates manually, though. Beware buying discounted bitcoins in countries cut off from the Internet.**
*edit: How much orphaned transaction data be held by a given node? It would be a shame if many transactions in a Syrian fork were deleted upon reintegration because of a silly thing like an age limit or a queue size limit.*
edit2: Miner nodes in an isolated Syria would lose all hope of getting bitcoin reimbursement for their work since they would be participating in a blockchain fork. Upon reconnection to the Internet (or the completion of one of those blockchain smuggling runs I described earlier) any blocks generated by miners in the isolated network would be considered orphaned blocks, the 25BTC bitcoin bounty would be invalidated, and the orphaned transactions would be reintegrated into the greater blockchain maintained by nodes outside of Syria and the transaction fees collected by outsiders. Therefore, *there is no monetary justification for running a bitcoin mining rig in a country temporarily cut off from the Internet.*

Maybe he is capable of erasing energy (like some souped-up cryoarithmetic data-erasing engine) from existence, causing a massive pothole in local vacuum energy density, and siphoning off a fraction of the resulting energy flux as nearby space-time dumps energy to fill the void.
Assuming this works, you could probably also pull a few megawatts from the spinning corpses of 20th century physicists (exploiting the "rolling over in his grave" phenomenon).

Jeff doesn't cite any sources for his claims (government is corporation-owned, use of fiat currency is fascism/communism, founding fathers were afraid citizens would vote to drain the government of money). I'm certain there is evidence for many of these claims, but I didn't hear any. If there are citations, then I can't find them on the website that was published. I certainly didn't hear any by the time I was 10 minutes into the interview.
2/10, would not listen to again.

Assuming the FTL barrier is never broken, traveling between star systems scores of light-years apart means voyages must last decades for economies stationed on planets. Interstellar merchants may only experience a few years travel time (depending on how good we get at accelerating and decelerating spacecraft) but I can't imagine local economies would like destabilization caused by newly-arrived merchants flooding the economy with last century's hoarded coins.
I haven't seen a virtual currency yet that is designed to last more than a few hundred years (much less thousands of years). What happens to a merchant's cryptocurrency if the Bitcoin Foundation decides to do a hard fork and begin releasing bitcoins beyond the planned 21 million? There had to be a built-in mechanism to deter protocol-meddling.
I'll have confidence storing currency for interstellar trade when I see a coin explicitly designed to never require a hard fork for 10^100 years ([LongCoin]( It'll need more than 64-bit time (1024-bit unix time?), it must be highly divisible (&gt;300 decimal places), and needs to be mineable for infinity yet have a constantly decreasing reward amount (like the [harmonic series: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 + 1/10 + 1/11 ... = a very slow way to get to infinity]( There needs to be some way of allowing two economies with two different hashing capacities to keep from destroying one another through difficulty-rigging shenanigans or double-spend schemes executed simultaneously yet light-years apart (transactions with timers that can release wealth when a certain future planet-side hour has arrived?).
Those are the kinda of qualities I want to see in a cryptocurrency before I'd trust seriously long-term wealth in it.

Export the wallet private keys into a different client and manually specify whatever transaction fee you feel is appropriate? It will probably take a very long time to approve, but some miner doing low transaction fee work will get to it eventually.
