Nah bcash is just what people call it to easily distinguish the 2 coins.

A problem shared with bitcoin for the most part. If the Chinese pools ended up working  together they could they could easily 51% bitcoin

Loud and interruptive, yeah absolutely no doubt about that... But how is he cocky in your opinion? 
He is dumb as fuck but he seems generally aware of the fact that he is a moron when it comes to anything that's not fighting, hunting, or the entertainment industry. 
I'm not a huge fan of him or anything but he doesn't seem like a bad person.

Why is uncle Tommy a problem?

What's is it's potential?

Yeah... You not able to answer the question?

Thank you for your interesting insight. In the small chance that it were the case that they possessed only shares (and they may be a big miner/mining organisation) do you know how proof of the future coins could be given?

apparently now they say that the reason the coins will not show on blockchain.info is because all of these mined coins have been stored offline once generated.
My colleague is there in person and said he has been shown the balances on bitcoin core by the sellers using bitcoind to access private keys. 
Does this make sense. Can block explorers not view the balances of wallets in cold storage?

On a full node, how does one check an address balance?

It's in uncle Tommy's best interest not to hinder our transaction. And we have other uncles that will do his job for cheaper too. We can trust our uncles.
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:46:28
Oh wow. Thanks. This is a big deal. So really if they show an address that has zero (or way less coins) on blockchain.info there's a good chance they don't actually have the coins to fulfill the transaction deal?
This is surprisingly hard to confirm. But so far I haven't found a single thing  online to confirm their claim that the mined coins wouldn't show up so it seems very fishy.

You paranoid delusional freak.

Yeah money laundering has always been one of the purported use cases.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:49:14


Absolutely wrong.
I know *a lot* about bitcoin and the more I learn, the more I realise how useless it is for 99.99999% of use cases.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:13:05
That's not "understanding bitcoin".
That's like saying basic password security for email accounts is "understand SMTP".
People don't need to understanding bitcoin. This post is retarded.

Look at his comment history. He's not joking, he's just hilariously delusional and possibly mentally handicapped.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:21:05


how so?
what was the argument against email other than other people not having access to the internet?
because the argument here is that even people with access to bitcoin would not ever consider using it in this use case because it is an inferior option. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:43:21
Lol... Which is it? 
I got downvoted or upvoted? 
It's like you don't even think about what you're saying. ��

Your own posts are upvoted by default, you mongoloid.

It's rare that I'm the smartest guy in the room so coming here is good for my ego.

I can teach you.

Sounds like free money.
