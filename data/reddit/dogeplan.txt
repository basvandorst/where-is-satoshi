The earth trembled and a great rift appeared, separating the first man and woman from the rest of the animal kingdom. As the chasm grew deeper and wider, all the other creatures, afraid for their lives, returned to the forest -- except for the Doge, who after much consideration leapt the perilous rift to stay with the humans on the other side. His love for humanity was greater than his bond to other creatures, he explained, and he willingly forfeited his place in paradise to prove it……Native American folktale...an Ojibway tale

Hey brother I understand.  There is an overall anti - intellectualism when it comes to money.   They are scared that the rules of the game change as part of the larger Game.  They are just trying to figure out how to make money, they don't want to remake money.
But...its not your responsibility.   If you think its irrefutable then just sit back and buy while you can.  To me thats thr appeal of dogecoin.  Its stupid. Its retarded.  People are retarded.

Bitcoin is gambling enough.  These games are gambling on top of gambling.  Be careful when you drink.  It's very easy to throw all your coins away.
Perfect money is dangerous!!!!!

Assuming the Bitcoin market is completely manipulated and a fabricated performance I would say yes.  The story works better if we've hit a floor on this cycle.

Money is the cult you have to be in to survive

My diversification is 10% in doge because of something I read in the Talmud about the face of the generation having the face of a doge.

It's more like an incentive not to shit in the municipal water supply.  While it may be more covenient to do so it creates system health risk.  Central banking is the metaphoric poo-in-the-water.

Money is the religion everyone has to believe in to survive.  Bitcoin threatens this belief on a fundamental level.  The threat breeds fear and the fear breeds anger.
Honestly this is why I don't talk about Bitcoin.  I talk about Dogecoin because it is stupid and doesn't terrify people.
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:59:24
Actually they deserve the doge up the doge
