There’s a difference between random chance and seeing the utility in something that 99% of the world doesn’t realize yet. Your example doesn’t relate at all to my experience with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:21:40
Honestly, if I was selling something for bitcoin, I’d accept whatever alt someone wants to pay in and exchange directly for btc. I think some bitcoin payment processors even offer that built in.

Trust me, if Bitcoin is an option, I use it 100% of the time. But it's not always possible. 
My point is, I think people should use Bitcoin however they want. Visa isn't going away any time soon. People shouldn't have to inconvenience themselves just to take a stance.

No, I'm just saying that $100 of Bitcoin is $100 Bitcoin. Just because early adopters made a ton of money doesn't mean everyone has to receive massive gains. 
You are focusing so much on people having access to so many Bitcoin in the early days when they were practically worthless. The number of bitcoins someone owns means nothing. It's about the dollar amount you own in Bitcoin.

I’m not 100% positive, but I believe it’s due to the amount of people using lightning right now. It’s still in beta so it’s not worth the risk to have a lot of money on the lightning network. As it matures, there will be more people who have open channels, which will allow more throughput. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:12:32
Now that you mention it, I think you're right. In any case, I don't see a reason to use online wallets. Might as well use a mobile wallet if you have a smartphone. As far as cold storage, I'm a big fan of the trezor. Also paper wallets are always safe if you do it right.

A normal wallet won't let you double spend. It's people who know how to create Bitcoin transactions without using a wallet and are able to broadcast custom transactions. Both transactions are valid as far as the network is concerned, but they will only accept the one with the higher fee (unless the lower one is confirmed first).

This is how you bitcoin. Take notes people.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:40:41
It’s definitely the most user friendly approach and the least amount of work to go from sale to USD. But if you ever want to get into bitcoin and use it the way it was intended (peer to peer payments without a middleman) then btcpayserver would be the way to go. 
Again, not everyone cares to do that and it’s great that you can still offer bitcoin payment for your customers.

Two separate platforms. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 13:50:03
I know that. Doesn't mean they can't operate, as a trading platform, independently. They don't share a balance and I can transfer between my coinbase wallet and my gdax wallet.

At the end of the day, it's a phone. What kind of features does a power user need? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:47:45
My biggest problem with the ledger is that you can only have 3-4 coins "installed" on your device at a time. You have to keep uninstalling/installing wallets to manage all your coins. 
Although it seems like this issue will be resolved once they release their new ledger software. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:28:32

Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:29:30
The keys do remain, but it's just a lot of juggling that doesn't seem necessary. 
Each coin has its own "app" you need to install from the ledger manager and there isn't enough space to install more than a couple at once.

I’m not kidding anyone. It’s the truth. And I’m only talking about on chain transactions. Obviously lightning transactions will be much faster and cheaper. But as it stands, bitcoin is still the fastest and most secure payment in the world.

You still have time! Bitcoin is still in the early stages.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:36:16
You don’t know how real world transactions work then. Sure when you pay with your credit card it says approved right away, but the transaction doesn’t actually clear until a day later. Same as 0 confirmation transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:44:32
You’re being pedantic now. I said fastest and most secure. The $10 bill is the most counterfeited bill in the country. How can I be sure this is a real $10 bill? Try sending me a counterfeit bitcoin. That’s right, you can’t.
@_date: 2019-05-24 11:43:42

@_date: 2019-05-25 22:58:30
Same can be done with bitcoin though. But where bitcoin has the advantage is the fact that the recipient gets their money much quicker.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:17:11
That’s not how it will work at all.
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:29:46
Don’t know why you are linking that website. But just because your transaction was approved instantly, doesn’t mean it cleared instantly. Whoever you paid won’t get the money until the next day or sometimes later.
Same can be done with bitcoin. Send a transaction and it shows up immediately, unconfirmed. The different is the bitcoin transaction can be fully confirmed and spendable within an hour depending on the fee.
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:05:21

@_date: 2016-07-16 22:12:55
I have 2 Trezor and love them both. It's impossible to lose your coins because you write down the seed which can be restored if the device is broken of lost. 
Also I've never heard a single story of Trezor being hacked. 
They are worth it if you have $1,000 or more in bitcoin in my opinion. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:23:04

@_date: 2019-05-30 19:14:10

Is ray talking about operating a darknet market?
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:31:37
I’m not talking about whether specific websites accept bitcoin or not. I’m talking about the technical limitations of bitcoin vs credit cards. This isn’t theory, it’s real world facts.

Damn dude you dropped a lot of money. Let's hope it only goes up from here.

Import paper wallet to electrum or any other personal wallet. Spend bitcoin. Put change back back a new paper wallet. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:41:15
For anything under $100 I would trust 
Anything more than that and you're better off using a software wallet.
PC - electrum  
iPhone - breadwallet  
Android - Mycelium  
Windows Phone - lol

@_date: 2013-04-03 21:44:36
Prices are pretty low right now ~$115 sometimes as low as $110. Seems like a good time to buy if your just starting. It will most likely just go up from here.

Could you separate the two qr codes?
Maybe front and back? Or left and right side?

The only thing you're gonna regret is not buying more. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:10:05
I haven't heard about that, but the reason a lot of people, including myself, like bitfloor is the fact that you can turn cash to bitcoins within 30 minutes without any proof of id
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:03:14
That confused me at first too. Basically an address doesn't exist until bitcoins are sent to it. And they are all generate from the same algorithm. The reason they are so safe is because it is nearly impossible to generate the same code twice. The public and private keys are linked algorithmically (if thats even the word). I'm not 100% on how it works, but thats what I've learned myself.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:09:25
You realize credit card transactions take a day to clear? Bitcoin is actually faster even when it appears to be slow.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:48:44
But not everybody needs to customize every aspect of their phone. Doesn’t make apples approach crap. I’ll take security and less customization over google monetizing my every action. 
And I know you can install custom roms that remove google services, but that’s too much work for a phone in my opinion.

This is probably the only real use I could see for litecoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:18:36
Well the blockchain app doesn't have a QR reader built in. I used the website to create a free wallet. Then I went to import/export and added the public key to the "watch only address". This allows me to keep tabs on which address has what amount on it without the need to rescan it every time. Then just log in with the app and you're all set! 
I know my explanation might be a bit confusing, so if you have any more questions I can try and help explain it better.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:15:26
This is awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:09:19
Try not to rub it in her face too much :P But nobody can really say for sure when to buy, but I was skeptical at $100 (as were you at $90), but look at the price now. If you can afford to risk the money, I say go for it!
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:13:47
Simply print out another one

Blockchain app works as a wallet
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:36:02
Yes, that is what is know as your public key which is where you send the bitcoins and it is the address you enter into blockchain.info the check the balance. Your private spend address is for your eyes only. You can import your private key from the same import/export page, but remember that any unused bitcoins must go to a new paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-08-03 05:51:42
I first saw these guys on the SR. Very surprised to learn the news about them today. Great candy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:21:53
Sounds like you have a pretty solid plan. Congrats!
@_date: 2013-10-20 04:58:51
It's simple. You save the HTML file to a thumb drive from your personal computer. The source code is visible and deemed safe. You then boot the liveCD and open the HTML page and generate the addresses. Even if the code was written to somehow store the addresses you generate, there's no way to send them back to their servers, since this pc is offline. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:57:46
wow congrats to you sir! I wish I had been as wise
@_date: 2013-09-05 22:37:49
It's funny, the first time I ordered from these guys was on the Silk Road.

Your welcome. Keep being awesome!
Any chance you will start selling hemp wick? I'd probably buy some of that.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:18:56
While this would be cool, it isn't very secure. They "could" have access to any keys generated using the app. It's a lot safer to use an offline computer or run a Linux live cd
@_date: 2013-07-25 20:55:38
This. Once you send them to another address, there is no way to link that address to you. You could have payed rent with those coins.
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:36:33
What's so hard to get about this. Bitcoin mining is what confirms our transactions. There's not much money in it these days, so he's saying for a $10,000 transfer, he would pay a $10 few to make sure it confirms in a timely manner and to give something to the miners.

I don't think so, but bitaddress can generate the address and you can just use that address on whatever design you want.
