Body parts for Bitcoin...

Looks interesting, have you ever used them or know anyone who has?

The twitter poll suggests a bearish market tomorrow.

I think $4750 pre segwit activation and then it'll fall back to c. $2800 and begin it's climb again.

Thanks for posting this and the answers below have been helpful.  I am now testing autopilot again (c.5 months later than OP)  I will list my findings.  I have to say channels, still take a while to open, the longest time a channel confirmation has taken to date is c.20hrs.

yes, it appears so.  I'm both relieved and disappointed.  No freebies but no risk to Bitcoin.

Thanks for the advice, I'll do so in the am.

I have tried the live chat option on exodus.io but sadly it is unavailable.  I've emailed them, messaged them via twitter.com and am yet to get a reply.  This is nearly $40,000 - any ideas?

Thanks for these.

Possibly but bitdefender states the Mac is safe.  This makes it all seem a little odd.

No, still buying small amounts.  I think I am addicted to buying Bitcoin.  Is there a twelve steps programme for Bitcoin buyers?
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:54:14
I kept buying, each time believing I had bought at the bottom.  Lol

I think they must change the first from a selection of values, the domain remains the same, or perhaps they insert a different domain a week? Who knows?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:20:26
Let's see.

The only concern I have is miners.  Will they stay online? Prices falling back may make it unprofitable.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:49
That and credit card news.

It's probably due to clawbacks.  It does annoy me that they seem to think we all need protecting.  Perhaps, the next sign up freebie should be a suit made from cotton wool and bubble wrap.
