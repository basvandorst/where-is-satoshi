I honestly just came for the free sticker, knowing this was a clever marketing ploy. And yet I still ended up buying that cool af vintage tshirt. Thx for the sticker and congrats on the website

I really like the sound of this, great question. Maybe some of the more insightful people of reddit will see your post and can comment. I want to see decentralised/transparent exchanges gain traction. For crypto-currencies first, but someday we could see everything from forex, stocks, and bonds, traded along with bitcoin and the other surviving alt coins, all with fees based on minimal cost of operations and absolute transparency. If that ever comes close to happening, decentralized poker and sports betting should already have arrived to the masses.

im pretty sure thats just the cushion coinbase sets in case the price goes up between clicking buy and then clicking confirm. i remember noticing the same thing back in April/May. Its just my 2 cents here, but gemini is better than coinbase/gdax for US customers (eventually we will have decentalized exchanges with none of these BS fees). best of luck

same here. I even opened a new CB account thinking they were just too swamped with new customers to be able to provide customer support. Got the 2nd account approved and bank account added, but CB never allowed me to purchase. Last week both my CB accounts have been marked for closure. When I log in, it requests that I withdraw any and all balances. No clue why they did this. I owned 1.0 bitcoin before the Aug 1 fork, so I'm suspicious they have the intention of depriving me of the bitcoin cash I should have coming. In the mean time, I've switched to Gemini. CB is a rip off. Decentralized exchanges can't arrive soon enough. Best of luck. Long live bitcoin
