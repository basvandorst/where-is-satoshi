This really has little to do with Bitcoin but is a good read nonetheless. Now, once there's an exchange providing call/put options, things will be different.
Edit: [this may be happening.](

But that only covers one end of the transaction. Sure, customers coming in can use a bitcoin ATM to get BTC to pay the dispensary, but the dispensary themselves in turn need a way to cash out from all the BTC they get. Unless they're willing to try living entirely off of BTC, of course.

The thing he wants the most may well be a way to sell (some of) his coins anonymously.

As close to the Apple store as legally possible. Then put an "App Store" sticker on it.

Pretty much in line with my experience. 
1) withdrawal and deposits were both on time
2) interface is pretty, simple
1) spread is gigantic, scalping is near impossible without a huge directional move
2) The Live open positions display left me with no confidence about the functionality of their system. I opened a position at their default (0.001 BTC I think), at 10:1 leverage, to test out the system. I came back to it a few hours later, and whoa! I had made 58 BTC! Then I realized, PnL ticked between losing 0.00001 BTC and gaining 58. I clicked liquidate and withdrew, too buggy to trust with real amounts of money.

Interesting app, thanks for the link.
From a brief read of its description, it sounds like it runs in the background and checks the price occasionally, filling your order when it matches your specified price.
I was thinking more of a service that you give a 1-time Coinbase API key to, and it manages it all for you. The key would have only the permission to execute that one order: "buy 0.25 BTC", for example, so a compromise wouldn't be disastrous.

Has anyone thought about holding a decentralized conference as well? A series of webinars all organized and ticketed identically except they're all online instead, with networking opportunities provided as invite-only social media and chat.
Seems to fit in with Bitcoin more than a physical event.

Maybe we'll see the rise of the 25c "disable ads" button.

This is the problem with the whole arrangement. According to that nytimes article about the guy worried about carrying so much cash around because he can't keep accounts open, banks are still very hesitant to allow money in that's at all associated with marijuana.
Sure, they can get a Coinbase or BitPay account, or even just take the payment directly to a wallet. But then what happens when they want to buy something (or pay their employees) in USD, as inevitably will happen? There's a single point of failure here, at the BTC-&gt;USD step. localbitcoins might help, but a dispensary or business would almost have to hire someone to just do that full time.

Another reason to use a password manager like 1Password. You don't have to recognize it as a fake site because it simply won't fill in your login credentials when the URLs don't match.

]Way to go, Coinbase. Next thing I'd love to have: support for limit orders. Go to bed during a correction, wake up having bought in at a desirably low price.
Wondering if they're avoiding this sort of thing as an institution whose purpose is more facilitating exchange than enabling speculative trading.
edit: found [this page explaining why]( "Coinbase is not an exchange, but more like a brokerage service."

Looks like there's a [meetup]( already.

I think that's what meant for the bitcoin ATM nearby, for the customers to use. It's almost like getting tokens to play at an arcade, except they're magic internet money instead.

Cool. Be sure to let us know when it's happening!

This won't help track your individual withdrawal, but FWIW, they are currently indicating "partially degraded service" at

electrum.com appears to be some sort of scam site, don't use that.

I love this. Spread the wealth and knowledge. Exactly the point of open source.

Doesn't Coinbase reportedly store up to 90% of its funds offline, in multiple physical locations? Is it still vulnerable despite all that?

Those turned out great. I made some from that site as well. Did you have calibration issues? The wallets' back image for me was always significantly larger than the front and I had to cut it away a bit so it would line up, but the final result is nice.
I can post more details about how I made them if anyone's interested.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:15:43
Probably not. It's worth noting that the creator of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, works for Coinbase.

Was going to ask for clarification, but I figured I'd just look it up myself. The interesting part is the first bit:






I'd be interested to know if anyone has hit that limit yet.

This is actually one of my major worries about Bitcoin's potential future widespread adoption. The method for securing your funds is so far markedly different than how one would secure, say, USD. I'm waiting for it to be easy enough that Grandma can create a secure wallet.

An interesting thing to say considering China's involvement in the recent BTC rise. That meme originates from the Chinese game show Fei Cheng Wu Rao:

Awesome neon sign. Where did he get that?

No, that's the "average Zhou". :)
Then I googled that term for kicks and found a [surprisingly relevant article about Bitcoin](
