''This is my life in the Bitcoin bubble.'' Hit piece. How do you not know when BTC hit $4k or $5k, that literally was a couple months ago.
This is trying to steer people away from bitcoin implanting the idea that its solely gambling and for losers.

Yes, I needed this. The only thing I could explain clearly to others on what bitcoin is is that it's a perfect online currency. I thought that would be sufficient but they had more questions. What else do I need to explain? Thanks for posting!
