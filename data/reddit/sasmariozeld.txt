if bitcoin can be killed by anyhting then we dont need it
@_date: 2019-10-18 08:14:40
Im pretty sure its mathematicly impossible now due to asics, not to mention the cost
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:00:04
I meant it to have any positive effect on the network
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:39:22

Thanks ver and Wu for the [sale!](
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:45:12
its definietly gonna be one of thr times now, i recommend buying now after the price goes up like 5%in a day or so basicly after the free fall
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:53:14
this is definietly gonna slow down btc price growth

@_date: 2017-09-26 11:28:37
i doubt that it will be btc , proly some more advanced altcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:20:55
just sell it and buy them back after the fork
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:29:52

@_date: 2017-09-15 15:48:53

it will recover but it will take way longer now
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:38:49
iim pretty sure steam also accepts btc altho they seem to turn it off before forks
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:22:25
difficulty woulda just climbed slower....

am i the only who would rather have it alive than dead? i mean the lighting network is basicly a corporate layer
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:36:57
its on sale you fools
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:23:32
bitifinex is the most scary of all the exchanges around , i would rather just use bittrex or kraken and ye i realized how bad that sounds
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:20:04
in short bankers and such try to overtake btc with 2x
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:56:53
it will recover but it will take way longer now
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:58:04
signaling is pretty much just a meaningless comment on the node tho isnt it?
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:49:31
i thought lighting networks are essentialy isp like entities ,  and i understand bigger blocks are bad coz they are easier to block but what if there wont be another solutions ? dont get me wrong i hate/btc but bcash as a fallback chain  isnt that bad of a thing
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:47:57
i rly like the rollercoaster one
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:25:46
coinbase ( gdax) bitifinex localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:13:13
might have to do something with the fork , steam did the same a during bcash
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:30:39
how do i sell my 2x coins tho? so i send it to my node get the privkey with the command send it 5o another place and use said privkey to acces my 2x coins on some other wallet?
