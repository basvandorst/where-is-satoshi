Your info is incorrect.
If you sell after moving to PR, you will still owe all regular capital gains taxes to the IRS from between the date you bought it and the date you moved. From the date you moved to the date you sold, this portion will be taxed by PR differently depending on how many years you hold it. The main benefit of Act 22 is for investment assets purchased *after* becoming a bonafide resident. 
(Note I have not heard the interpretation you referenced that because crypto is considered personal property that somehow even previously acquired holdings can be exempt when moving to PR. I'd recommend against this interpretation and to use the interpretation above to be 100% confident and avoid possible unexpected bad surprises in the future. Even cleaner is to sell all holdings and and reacquire after moving to PR, though that's not necessary.)
Keep in mind there is a large annual cost (required donation of $5,000 total annually to registered non-profits) and you really have to make it your home and meet all IRS' bonafide residency tests.

Yes, **talk to an attorney in PR**, ideally more than one. This guy \^ VinBeezle is an idiot, just being the loudest person &amp; most persistent on the internet doesn't make a person correct, and his advice is going to hurt people.
There is no such thing as the "Puerto Rico BDO tax authority". BDO is the name of a private accounting firm. Hacienda is the name of the tax authority.

I'm not claiming it's correct either; I'm saying **Do Your Own Due Diligence** from an attorney and prepare to get fucked if you choose this interpretation, because it is NOT what my attorney nor those of my other friends in PR have counseled. Nor is it even a reasonable interpretation of the law in my opinion.
Please don't tell me you're part of the Brock following douche bags who influxed in December?  I've heard they have that interpretation. Because if you all do it that way and get audited and fucked, that's your problem. But I certainly wouldn't recommend it. I know I have nothing to worry about.
