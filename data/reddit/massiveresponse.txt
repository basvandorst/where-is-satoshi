This tool seems like it is a third party monitoring tool.
So, hypothetically, bitgo lets them know what addresses to watch. They watch them, and in case of suspicion they can let bitgo know in an automatic way. In case of a serious issue, it could be something that would result in automatic calls/texts to every single person and phone/fax machine/email address at Bitfinex, telling them to wake up because shits going down and to take the site offline/secure everything.
While the above process would not have completely halted the theft, it would have significantly limited the loss.

But it would mitigate double spend attacks that were not supported by any hashing power, but rather by encouraging the acceptance of a specific transaction by the inclusion of a higher fee.

The problem is that what if it was too little? What if the demand for the currency expanded by more than 2% per year? Then it would be deflationary again.

There are two main protocols used in networking. TCP/IP and UDP.
TCP/IP is used when you need to reliably know that a message you sent was received, but it is slower and more bandwidth intensive.
UDP (Unreliable Data Protocol) is a way to just send a message quickly, without needing to be sure it was received 100% correctly. This is used in things like VOIP, because even if a part of the data is lost, you will still be able to make out what was said.
EDIT: OK OKAY I GET IT: It's User Datagram Protocol.

You would not have to snap any photos.
The ideal application would work as follows.
1) You take out your phone, unlock it, and launch the application. (Like taking out and opening your wallet)
2) Once the store has finished scanning your goods, a QR, or other type of code appears on a monitor, with other payment information, like your total. (This is not really different than it is now)
3) You press "Quick-Pay" or something similar in your application, and point your phone camera at the QR code. (This is like swiping your card)
4)The application shows the total, and asks you to confirm (One button press), at which point the payment is transmitted to the network. (This is perhaps the one possible extra step, confirming it, however most credit card payment systems ask me to select credit or debit, to sign the receipt, ask for cash back, need to swipe the card again, etc. which are all similar if not longer delays)
5) You wait for 1 - 3 seconds for the vendor to confirm that payment is received. (This is just like it is now)
So, in conclusion, this works perfectly fine and is at least just as good as current systems as far as payment speed is concerned.

In the US, I don't know of any agency that can just give you call and legally demand you tell them the origin of your funds... and issue consequences if you don't. There needs to be some suspicion of a crime and then a court order to do that.

@_date: 2014-07-19 19:41:02
Well, in the long run, bitcoin would be used between vendors and suppliers as well. So if the vendor accepts bitcoin, they can hold it, and when their supplier accepts bitcoin, they can take that as payment from the vendor, further reducing fees in the system until it filters all the way through.
The more entities that accept it, the higher the volume becomes on exchanges and the more stable the price becomes, alleviating the risk of accepting it as payment further.
The way I see it, it is just now starting to snowball into this eventuality.

And that is not set in stone either. People could agree to change the mining algorithm and release a new bitcoin client where minting does not end in 2140, in the same way that bug fixes are handled.

Well, probably, though it would really require some kind of AI programmed into the core bitcoin protocol that would have to determine the rate of inflation based on the same types of things that a central human authority would. And also would need the capability to change those variables on its own and learn.
Any other hardcoded solution could run the risk of eventually becoming deflationary again due to changing circumstances.
@_date: 2014-10-27 06:07:44
Yeah, but it may still make a good story even if the back was legally and technically allowed to do what it did. 
Just because it was allowed to, and was likely in its best interest to do so at the time does not mean that it will not make a good story, and was not a shitty thing to do from the point of view of the customer, and the other people who will see the story.
@_date: 2014-06-12 04:53:40
A block does not have to be solved in order to accept a payment.
Payment can be accepted once the transaction is broadcast, and before it is included in a solved, broadcasted block that is accepted by the network.

But bitcoin is more of a debit card, so it would not cause those same problems.

You really are not considering things in context here. It is almost like you are intentionally trying to miss my point. Let me give your current payment system in the same kind of spin that you are trying to show bitcoin payments in.
You are telling me that having to look through my pockets to find my wallet (this stupid big leather container thing i have to pay extra for), pulling that thing out from all the other crap in my pocket, opening it, having to find which card i want to pay with, having to deal with all kinds of different payment systems and hardware at almost every different store i go to could possibly be faster than unlocking my phone and pressing "Pay"? which take like 3 seconds?
There will likely be a better solution in the future, possibly even one that is faster than bitcoin, but I have yet to see it. 
Are you seeing my point? You have to compare apples to apples without, apparently, trying to spin things in your favor.

Yeah, they could accept all of them for all I care. My point is simply that singling one out and almost advertizing it is off-putting. It's better to simply say that crypto, or digital currency will be the in-game currency.

The money would move [long] before you gave them the key. If you give them the key at any time the money is there, it is now gone.
It could also have been moved by someone else who you voluntarily or involuntarily gave the key to. Then, they would somehow have to establish that you own the new wallet address. It is plausible that you dont, because currently people lose their bitcoin due to their lack of knowledge and/or security far too often.
It is likely that a small but significant number of people using this defense will not be lying. They actually have lost their funds.
This is also made much more complex with multi-sig wallets that require multiple keys to move the funds. You can make a wallet that requires 3 or 4 of 5 total keys, claim that you only have 1, and give it up.
When asked who has the other keys, you can pick people who may plausibly have it, but dont, or just claim that you dont know who has them. You just contributed to the transaction when another set of people authorized it, but never met them in person.
With multi-sig, you have the option of providing an endlessly plausible run-around, while never giving up your funds, and always retaining the ability to move them yourself, and deny having done so.
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:12:18
I really love the concept of this game and i even made a pledge!, however, making dogecoin the primary crypto-currency for some reason turns me off to it at first glance.
Would you consider referring to it generically as crypto-currency or digital currency? I think that would mitigate the effect and actually get people interested while in the background, you can primarily accept any crypto you want and then some. Hell, you could even make your own coin. VOID COIN?
@_date: 2015-05-03 05:37:56
Planning ahead definitely helps.


In a multisig situation, how do they *know* that you have it? The *owner* of a true multisig wallet is a group of people or systems. In order to allow funds to move, a majority of them have to provide their keys to sign off on the transaction.
How can it be shown that a single person truly has, and has had control of all the keys either now or in the past? It would require a lot of convincing evidence.
You are right that they will probably add conspiracy charges to you, but will it stick in a jury? You can plausibly claim that you don't have the other keys. Someone else has them. There is nothing you can do about this. You have done everything you can to help, including having given up the key you have, and provided the names of the other people who have them, but there is just nothing else you can do about the keys you don't have.
A jury may very well be extremely sympathetic in the absence of a lot of evidence that shows you as having been the sole owner, instead of just one of many owners.

Ok, lets say that they know you have bitcoin, and they have identified the address or addresses that belong to you and demand the private key.
Soon after, all amounts from all those wallets are transferred to another single wallet.
Now, they demand that you turn over the private key to that wallet. But wait, is that your wallet?? How can they know? You are ofcourse struck with grief, since your wallet was hacked, and all your bitcoin stolen!
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:14:27
In the U.S. you are protected from being a witness against yourself, so can use the defense that giving up the private key would incriminate you.
Additionally, you can claim that the wallet is not yours, and therefore cannot provide a key that you dont have.
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:32:23
But not to seize. Bitcoin funds can only be seized if your private key is obtained.
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:37:26
They need to actually know what your bitcoin wallet is to be able to do that.
Because of this, there will always be plausible deniability, and your defense can be that your funds were stolen and converted to bitcoin without your consent.

Ofcourse they are not stupid. This is all about plausible deniability, to establish reasonable doubt, and mitigate your penalties/chance of a successful conviction/seizure.
Doing this with bitcoin is much easier since there is no third party that can agree to hand over your assets. It must be done through the holder of the private key, and this holder can always deny having it, and does not need to go through any third party to move these assets whenever he/she wishes.

I cant speak to that. I was picked once, showed up. Some kid's murder trial. Out of the 80 potential jurors in the room, I was one of the 12 picked.
The jurors seemed like regular people. A few old. I was one of the young people in my 20's. Most everyone else was middle age. Good amount of smart looking people, average, and hillbilly's still wearing their stained shirt.
In selection, a few of the old people got kicked out because they said the guy must be guilty just because he has been charged. A few other middle aged people kicked out because they had some bias due to overlapping experiences. Then all the young people got kicked out - because as i read after, young people are unpredictable in a jury.
One of the other jury members, a girl in her 20's, was freaking out a little in the jury room because "the murderer knows how i look now, What if he decides to go after us?" and was visibly tearing up. So i kinda tend to agree with the unpredictable bit, as i was completely ready to listen impartially to evidence.
Kid was acquitted 2 days later and went free.

So cant you just start at 0 and work your way up? meaning you dont have to actually treat the password as characters.
EDIT: UTF8 is variable width, and has a max of 6 bytes per character... meaning that worst case scenario you may need to look through 18 bytes, or more traditionally, an 18 character password. This gives a possible range of about (2^144) or 2.2300745e+43.

Well, yes and no. 
Scenario 1)
Suppose you invest 10000 dollars. You then lose 10000.
You are limited to writing 3000 off of against your income per year, and can carry over 7000 to write off 3000 the following year, until all is written off, year by year.
Scenario 2)
You invest 10000 dollars. 5000 is lost, but the other 5000 makes you another 5000 dollars.
So can you write off only 3000 this year? Nope. You can write off the entire 5000 against your gains of 5000. And if you needed to, can write off another 3000. So you have no taxable stock gains to tax this year.

It is the fact that the majority of oil can only be bought with the US Dollar. The only way countries can get oil it directly is by buying dollars, and then spending those dollars on oil. 
This increases the value of the US dollar due to its increased demand, and because of this the US is strongly opposed to other oil producing countries selling oil using any other currency.
