You could say the same about Reddit.
People use it because there is great content  —&gt; there is great content because lots of people use it  —&gt;  People use it...

Maybe it was a decoy to hide it from its real hiding place

I hope he is eating with a soft fork

Great job! Visually it's very pretty. 
I analyze and plot data for a living so I can offer a few suggestions. Direct labels are usually easier to read rather than the number labels. The circular price is original but it's a bit difficult to compare the height on the bottom of the map to the top. I see there are guidelines but only if I zoom in a lot.
I'm curious what programs you used to plot the data and made the graphic in?

Why is there a gentleman's agreement to take the first tx rather than the one with the highest fee? Isn't that how 'child pays for parent' works, by incentivizing miners to accept the higher fee tx first?
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:42:21
Ah okay that makes sense. So incase a merchant was willing to accept 0 confirmation transactions, you'd be a 'gentleman' by helping protect them from a double spend attack.
@_date: 2018-06-01 15:55:31
Thanks for the clarification. 
My point was a little bit more general, just that miners are capable of re-prioritizing transactions based on the fees associated with them. If there is nothing 'ungentlemanly' about CPFP, then why would there be anything 'ungentlemanly' about prioritizing a higher tx fee transaction for the same utxo compared to one that came earlier? 
As I understand from the other answer, it's because it's a casual defense against double spending attacks.
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:08:30
Thanks for that.
Lol Roger.

Thanks. As I understand, a lot of mining pools are based in China, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the members of the mining pools are physically located in China. I know it’s advantageous to be close to the mining pools but I just wanted to make a distinction between mining pool location and miners. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:10:00
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:04:31
Dude just learn how it works if you really want to do these things yourself.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:50:45
No no. I meant how people were initially wrong about the internet, in the same way they are wrong now about bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:49:07
Yeah sorry I realise the post was misleading. The purpose was to give examples of how people *mischaracterised* the internet as a tool for criminals. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 03:47:31
Nice, I’ve watched almost all videos of Andreas online but not this lol. Thanks
@_date: 2019-02-07 09:32:07
What year was this article?
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:46:48
Yeah that’s right. I thought it would be obvious but re-reading it now I see it’s totally ambiguous lol
@_date: 2018-11-19 07:05:33
Do you remember when he said he would never appear on TV again? Lol
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:23:08
He will probably claim anything above 500,000 can be rounded up
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:30:53
Thanks a lot, this was the kind of answer I was looking for
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:32:10
Thanks a lot 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:43:56
If that was true then why would people join mining pools?
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:47:19
Entropy increasing is inevitable 
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:22:11
I don't know if it's possible to do the same analysis with Bitconnect, but that would be a good control. 
Some people were stupid enough to buy Bitconnect tokens even after the exchange shut down. If these people were the richest in Bitconnect, that might suggest that people who hold a lot of a token just want even more. Alternatively, if the riches were selling off, that might support the idea that the richest wallets generally make good decision.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:29:32
I thought there was some additional efficiency to being in a mining pool. I thought maybe the mining 'work' would be divided in such a way so that miners would not repeat work by checking for nonces that other miners were calculating. I take it that's not true and the only benefit to being in a pool is having a more steady cash flow?
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:18:56
If that was true then why would people join mining pools?

Neither, I’m finishing my Phd in biology and aiming to transition into data science

Thanks :)

Already done that multiple times for my colleagues, friends and family hahaha
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:34:47
Great work, much appreciated
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:49:32
Haha, when I got the Coinbase notification I came here looking for this :)
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:05:49
Yeah, it was the _spam_ transactions pushing up the transaction fees
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:52:13
Congrats on the BBC video! 
Bitcoin peaks and falls become race tracks

@_date: 2018-04-02 23:19:59
I'm not 100% confident on what the link is but yeah I hear it a lot too. I have a few vague ideas why spam tx could lead to high tx fees.
Big miners accepting self generated high fee tx, (and maybe in combination with spam txs) can trick wallets trying to estimate adequate tx fees for fast transactions. If enough wallets are overestimating tx fees then it would also slightly become a self fulfilling prophecy. 
I know it's expensive but I also know Roger Ver and maybe some other people probably have a tonne of btc/bch to spend on such an attack.
Also maybe the backlog of small txs slows down the network a bit? That would reduce the total tx/s and increase fees potentially?

*on my laptop
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:10:35
Even if it was orchestrated by miners, they’d effectively be cutting into their own revenue by not collecting tx fees from other transactions, so they’d still be paying for it either way.
@_date: 2019-05-25 05:12:23
Link to what? I saw this in a shop lol
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:31:15
I bought a few stickers from blockstream
@_date: 2019-05-25 05:12:50
It was a random shop in SF I don’t remember the name
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:29:53
1/infinity  :)  I don’t remember the exact amount but virtually nothing

I’ll be honest it took a while to set up the node and I had to try a few times to set up the channel, but once it was up it was pretty much instantaneous yeah 
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:27:48
Fuck! I was waiting to make this post! Good job :)
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:36:18
For anyone who’s interested, I followed Ivan on Tech’s tutorial. He has a great channel btw

Nice! Which store was it from?

27 to go!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:38:02
You need about 300gb of hard-drive space. There isn’t too much you can buy on LN. I got some stickers from blockstream 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:26:17
Oh wow thanks a lot both of you!!
I got the 2 stickers that say “I got Lightning to work and all I got was this sticker” ��
