I don't get it. Is he saying transfers will give him bitcoins? Mining while transferring?

Ask for signatures in your local area(that claims they want bitcoins), show them those signatures and give them(small business owners) websites/information on how to add it into their business.
This is my answer only to the title though and not on the preparations part.

Just read the whole article and it does not really give any clear evidence linking him to bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto to this Dorian S. Nakamoto other than his name and comments by his family. Being secretive, anonymous is not really uncommon as most on the internet tends to be that way. Being good at something especially math is not uncommon especially in persons I call "migrating workers". If they weren't, then why would a country hire him or allow him to be a resident?

I just want to point out that those names are not "official" names. Google "IAU not endorsing Uwingu project". Names in the  Uwingu project are merely "nicknames/pet names" for now. It might change but no word on that.

Payza used to be Alertpay and that's something.

Adblock plus (and programs/addons/whatever like this) is a cancer to the internet. They destroy small website owner's lives and will inevitably lessen websites numbers to the point that only big ones will propagate or those that they control.
Adblock plus also accepts payment from websites so they will be included in their "acceptable ads" list so their ads will pass-through. Its in their website or if you want facts, 
It is like you're donating to your government's internet filter.

If you really have that "great idea", why not hire coders to do it for you. There are a lot of sites that offer these services. Throwing money at something solves everything.

Got 2 legit disputes and I won both of them.

There was a social network(not facebook) sold for more than $200M that was owned by two kids(USA) and was created by the help of these online coders. I don't want to reveal the name of that social network site but you can google around and know the answer. If 2 kids(or maybe their parents) have enough money to make that site, why not anybody else?
Another idea is to make yourself a company and ask good coders to join that company for free(in exchange for a cut/percent/equity/whatever you like to call it and ask for funding like Ycombinator. It was the one that backed this site, but this is a huge risk on everyone and it would be better to just pay somebody else, check if its doing great then ask people to join as they would be more willing because you already have it running.

Just wait for Google to accept bitcoins as payment. They are planning for that but I don't know if they will really do it.

So bitcoin is not a currency but an account book? This will be more confusing to new users or people that don't know what bitcoin is except the name.
Sidebar's tagline is better albeit need a bit of fixing. Instead of Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet, Bitcoin is a currency made on the internet.

So at the end of the day, we don't know if Mark has bitcoins somewhere, bitcoins that he may have already sold, cash that he may have used automatically to buy bitcoins after the Gox crash or if he still have people's fiat/bitcoins.

I might after I get better at coding.

Voat is figuratively trying to be one of the big boys while wearing small boy pants. Down times and other problems should be expected.

There is really something fundamentally flawed with bitcoins or maybe even all crypto coins because they rely on a handful of people to develop the code further and the majority can only voice their concerns through shouts and hisses. Even if there is a consensus achieved by a majority, if a few of the people "adding the code" is in opposition, the consensus fails with nothing achieved and all boils down to an endless debate of nothingness. So the consensus is really not "the majority of people that uses bitcoins" but the consensus only by the developers.
So what's the solution? A soft fork that suspends everything(or those needing suspending) until something achieves a majority and then the majority will force the fork(hard fork) to the minority. Yes there will be pain implementing a system like this in Bitcoin but it will stop the meaningless non-stop almost half a year debates and give some power back to the community. A theoretical example is to change the name of Bitcoin to something else. People can give their suggestions(code) and everyone can vote(by using it) the suggestion they want and if that becomes the majority, everybody will be hardforked.
As I am seeing now, if no solution comes, Bitcoin will either die or split in two.

What's that suppose to mean? Are you implying something?

A bit confused how will this work.
