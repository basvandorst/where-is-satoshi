Moronic move to discourage certain Korean people from owning cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:17:47
You are a Bcasher, not a Bitcoiner
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:36:28
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:00:28
Buy more now then you can win
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:05:06
You need to pay some fee to leave coinbase and use a different wallet. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:29:08
You are hopelessly bcash
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:14:40
Right. We should shrink the block size and that's what devs are working on
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:42:27
I like Bangladeshi food but I don't like how you mentioned Bangladesh
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:19
Big blockers buy Bcash. Small blockers buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:19:59
Block increase destroys bitcoin irreparably. Don't even think of that.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:05:01
He can ride the tide. That's the  rule in the market.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:32:48
You are overestimating many things
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:11:38
The best forecast, they mean
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:56:24
I thought you emphasized Verge as a shitcoin example
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:30:29
The value of Bcash is zero in this sub
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:12:03
If the weekly growth rate is g, by buying $100 every week, you get
    (100/3900){1+(1+g)^(-1)+(1+g)^(-2)+...} = (1+g)/39g
If this value is less than .25 BTC, the weakly growth rate needs to be more than 11%. So, if the growth rate is less than that, yes, you ultimately get a full coin.
But in the other scenario you won't care about this math any more. Your .75 BTC will be worth more than $650k in one year.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:06:49
We all could buy bitcoins worth $20 in 2010, but we didn't. That's the regrettable decision.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:52:56
What if the value of USD dissipates as BTC is getting prevalent?
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:22:32
Thank you. Another fantastic explanations. I'm naturally curious how the hashlock thing will be implemented, but it will be my next ToDo reading.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:01:49
Is that so? I thought it's a funny joke, but if that's an implicit antisemitism, I stay away.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:56:06
Early adopters provided no personal information and some of them are villains 
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:25:12
Their difficulty should have started from 1% or something. It's not a big deal to have too many blocks especially at the beginning.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:39:01
Your calculation is bullish, but it's still not enough for John McAfee not to eat his dick. Just $60,000 in 3 years.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:25:14
Sounds like a good feature. More deflationary.
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:53:59
I've never heard of that, sorry
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:36:42
No! Give them for free!
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:56:33
Sounds like Alexander the Great

@_date: 2017-08-26 03:44:01
Could somebody educate me about how LN and the main chain communicate each other?
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:32:08
Credit card companies don't ask us to store private keys securely. 
It sounds like comparing apples and oranges, well, maybe apple juice.
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:26:44
Do you want to pay 60% income tax?
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:01:02
Nothing happened to the BTC chain, BCC was just distributed to BTC holders for free. So no basis change for BTC. BCC has zero basis. Simple.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:53:36
At least he has been trying to be apolitical
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:15:55
Thanks a lot.


Probably this part is one of the things I was missing. I mean, I thought if Layer 1 needs to record every outcomes, the number of transactions recorded on Layer 1 won't be so different from that for Layer 2. I guess things recorded on Layer 1 will be things like snapshots taken every several months or even years.
It's also good to know LN can be seen a series of (not malleable) unconfirmed transactions from the point of view of the main chain. Of course the actual implementation should be more sophisticated than that, though...
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:25:42
Is this another coup or just Luke Jr dropping out from the Core team?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:34:32
It's likely to happen to many of us
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:01:15
Hey kid, you need $2,500 to buy a single coin. Save money and come back.
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:07:25


No. Asicboost is another big difference. Probably the largest. BIP91 and SegWit2x can be compatible with AsicBoost.
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:17:12
I don't know the history or what are they. It seems like r/btc is on the miners' side, right? I guess initially they were pro-larger blocks (and r/bitcoin was/is not) and they became pro-miners, but I'm just guessing. Did anybody see what happened?
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:17:52
I suspect Bitmain's main objective is to manipulate the price down to buy cheap coins. Of course, most minors are losing and don't want this mess, I guess.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:49:31
You just need a private key. Your wallet doesn't have to be offline. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:02:25
British people occasionally post this kind of question/complaint. Isn't Kraken accessible/reliable in the UK?
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:40:26
Nothing applies to real Rothschild then
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:40:46
These people are telling you way too advanced topics. Go to coinbase, buy some Bitcoin, and see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:18:20
No worries. We all lose more than 1k anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:22:25
I like pen and paper
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:23:17
Right, but bulls can stably profit even with dips
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:13:21
I already saw a post from these guys
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:58:14
OR, not XOR. So both can happen. That's what I expect.
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:25:04
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:37:36
Then Bitmain says that's unfair
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:53:55
Are you talking about anything more than what people in this sub are saying? Even game theory isn't fancy words in this community.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:30:03
Can we all live in a castle?
@_date: 2017-07-14 05:45:25
Isn't Bitcoin better than gold?
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:01:17
The bottom-right was a huge mistake. The price ($2440) just makes us sad, or becomes laughable in near future.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:04:42
That's a small cashback to merchants

Pay taxes and you will be okay. Is there any reason we should be afraid of the social security office? I don't get OP's point.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:55:50
So, the split may happen in two days! Even before August 1!
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:53:51
Yeah, and this book also needs to be split after August 1
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:35:38
Buy every dip
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:20:57
And we open Blockfolio on our cell phones on the beach
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:48:50
No, buy the dip. Plus, do the dollar cost average.
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:22:38
I'm pretty sure it's impossible. You need to get some wallet that gives you private keys. I don't know much about wallet choices, sorry.
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:42:42
This clip doesn't end properly. This helicopter doesn't explode.
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:04:15
At least they claim they don't charge transaction fees (other than fees that go to the network).
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:10:42
Your addresses for BTC become valid addresses for BCCash as well with the same balances. This is because the two coins share the same block chain until the split.
But, if you keep BTC in exchanges, you might be doomed.
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:36:48
Zuckerberg sells privacy. At least Jihan doesn't
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:59:58
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:15:21
Yeah hodl
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:44:46
Right. Sell whatever you have and buy as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:26:44
Sounds right. I don't do margin so it didn't come to my mind, thanks. 
They (and some of other shorters) will close their positions around August 1, before everything settles down. Then...?
Edit: I thought about it again. Now I feel it is shorting that doesn't make sense with a lot of Bitcoin possession. In either way, they will do/are doing something not only to the coin but also to the market.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:01:21
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:25:27
We should also expect the scenario of ban.
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:35:57
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:41:03
Yes, it's possible that BTC1, BTC2, BTC3, and BTC4 are all worth $1000.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:39:26
The BTC price doesn't matter (if we live in a non-cryptic real world).
For example, if the price of Dash is $150, and if you want to buy 10 DASH, then you just buy BTC worth $1,500 and exchange it with 10 DASH. 
The price of BTC doesn't matter. For example, if BTC is $15, you buy 100 BTC. If BTC is $15,000 (we will see that soon), you buy 0.1 BTC. The outcome is the same: you get 10 DASH for $1,500.
Of course, transaction fees will steal a few bucks from you, so in reality, you will need to pay $4-10 more...
Edit: miscalculation
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:21:23
I will, if the price is halved or less. And that's possible, I think.
@_date: 2017-07-05 04:09:32
They just won't pay consumption tax for (some of?) cryptos. Capital gains are taxed.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:53:11
I like Attenzione
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:18:05
Your income tax is determined by the USD amount of your Bitcoin-based salary. You won't get any tax benefit.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:47:09
Altcoin buyers. They need BTC (or ETH).
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:12:59
...to margin sell!
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:29:27
Because we hate miners. Nothing more than that.
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:30:32
This guy just wanted to say game theory. No real content.
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:21:51
Ah, I didn't know that and it makes sense. Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:09:55
But wait, if the price hits $50, we can buy 40 coins...
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:19:20
I saw a dozen of similar posts, if not hundreds
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:06:15
Then who are selling?
