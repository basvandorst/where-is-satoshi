The steel case is made for vending machines. heavy lock and Can be bolted to a surface. But yes you are correct they are very portable as is.
It is a Android nexus 7 with a steel kiosk case.
btw, we are on google play so anyone can dl the app and build there own unit to suit there needs.

The raspberry pi drivers drivers for the bill acceptor they are using have been written and open sourced by cash2btc for for awhile.

Yes, but how much does it cost to become a money transmitter?
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:54:58
that car battery is way overkill. 
reminds me of the snuke I built last year.
The pair of UPS batteries lasted me 6+ hours. those pyramid bill accetpors really dont take much power.
@_date: 2014-04-09 01:38:25
we sell the units in person, and you can also buy the hardware yourself and download the app from google play. cash2btc.com

sorry about the horrid picture. I have my nice 13mp camera here but the AA's it needs are dead and I cant seem to find any batteries in this entire convention. There are some High def pictures the orginzers took that should be posted tomorrow.
Figured Id throw this up in case any redditors are here on the convention floor and didnt notice the for sale sign.

you need to have bitcoin to load from your hosted wallet. when the device is used you are simply moving btc from a hosted wallet to new address ( an address scanned into the device via QR code)

Two way SMS is the key, I can reach almost every country right now but only sending text messages.
I'm built around a single large provider, but as the project matures I fully intend on using services that that can access more then just the US CANADA and UK  in two way sms.
(ps. you can always open an account and forward that .01 to a new lucky person in your phone book)

yes, during the last fork a guy skrewed OKpay out of 10grand by reloading his keys and submitting a transaction into the new chain. Even though there was 6 signatures, because of the fork he got to withdrawl the coins from OKpay and spend the coins used to fund it.

ah good to see they are getting out in the wild!
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:16:42
check the FAQ
c2btc does not sell bitcoin.
the owner of the device is responsible for operating the device. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 22:01:34
we sell fully assembled units for 1500, on cash2btc.com
We also sell just the DIY kit for 750~ hardware/software lifetime support/upgrades and btc wallet hosting. 
We do actually have an dispenser in Australia was sold to a guy around Melbourne I believe.
I got a couple snuke cases already built, should be able to get one out pretty quick.

Ha, hey did you get a better look at the other bitcoin atm? (big black box with the coin acceptor?) The front bezel looks like it might be one of ours! hard to tell without the sticker. was the back purple like this?
if so Looks like they are set up with our new Rpi drivers!
we got a couple dozen out in the wild. We actually have a full unit in a commercial location But cant disclose where it is due to privacy concerns of the customer. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 01:20:47
Self service, wasnt claimed. Obviously the case should be attended to prevent it walking away. But the operation doesnt need to do anything but run a program and just hang out.
I hate the term ATM but thats what makes headlines. Its a POS for btc
It is self contained, everything you need is in the case. Power wifi etx. A self contained rv still needs a user...
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:11:21
I think the wording was a bit off, thanks, I corrected it. franchise sounds like associated with running them. Bulk discount is much better. 
My service basically boils down to just a hosted wallet that moves bitcoin when commanded too from the devices.

We got it built; but still have a lot to do! but I couldn't resist posting a pic!
And the blockchain! c3af524d30c96d427a001bcd08204c1a5f9e69de¬b9c561dfcfc5768ced93fb2d
the first transaction!
We will have a formal video presentation soon! It is getting recorded by our university tomorrow. 
However we do have our site we will be using to keep in contact with people wanting to get involved! 
I want to post more details but we have a lot of work to do getting a scalable business model and don’t want to speak too soon.
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:12:35
I'm working on setting that number-pad up for one time access. (it its current form if your given the PIN once you always have access. that is a no no, lol)
That way I can arrange for some one to open the device by sending bitcoin equal to the total money in the device. Giving the operator more bitcoin to sell, and emptying the device for more use. 
not true cash dispensing, but still very useful for operation. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 04:00:50
if you look on the website; we do offer a version in a wall mounted safe.
Sure you can use your phone around the office, but are you going to stand in one place 24/7/365? as bitcoin grows and starts infiltrating new markets the need for this kind of automation should be pretty handy. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 08:33:21
good points, I cleaned it up a bit. will look into extending the tutorial.  
@_date: 2013-09-15 08:47:05
The OTP is an encrypted method of authentication. The messages themselves are not encrypted, but the key is based of a challenge (example 23) and a response (23 is an address on a 10x10 grid with a corresponding key value) example "Tz"
As long as you protect this key no one can send btc from your account (or even view your balance) without first unlocking your account. 
the keys are generated and presented to you in a encrypted environment (SSL + login script) if you keep this key secure that key will never hit the net, or any sms networks, unencrypted.
Check out the OTP, it worth taking the extra time to secure your account!
And yes, you can still link address's for an air gaped cold storage wallet's address and simply send btc to it from your hosted wallet at any time you like.  
@_date: 2013-05-10 19:57:01
1.	In order to protect the security of the device at this time I do not plan on releasing the source code of the device or servers running them.
2.	This device is rather strait forward to build and patents would be pissing in the wind I believe.
3.	Nothing is set in the business model yet, because its not made yet :)
4.	We would be willing to partner with any party looking to host the devices; the only exception would be if they asked us to be exclusive. I care more about getting these devices out there to anyone willing to host them. Asap.
5.	We are open to most arrangements; re-branding the devices with partners logo’s advertising can all be arranged.
I think the best way to get this moving is a party agrees to lease the device. Cash2BTC can then find business willing to host the dispenser short term and keep them moving around for large events.

little back story, its not finished, going to have a nice big screen hooked up to it soon.
we sell these bitcoin dispensers build to order at 
Put cash in get bitcoin out. a lot more info on the site.
Im improving a bunch of stuff on them an will be posting more when its finished.
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:44:15
well; a lot of us here in would really like to see a lot of in person/brick and mortar stores accept bitcoin. 
Now wouldn't it be cool to not only have a restaurant accepting bitcoin; but selling it as well. People from all over can travel to the device to buy bitcoin. You can walk in, buy bitcoin with cash. And if you want you can go sit down and get dinner.
Or if you are talking to some one about bitcoin you can just point them over there and have them buy 5$ worth.
We are also going to have it so people can donate btc to the device and it will either 1 (print coupons for free food) or 2 discount the conversion rate so customers can get more BTC then they are paying for it. Generating more traffic.  
but no, not touching paypal with a 10 foot poll.
Our goals are to make a company that mitigates all risks and focuses on trying to deploy the devices as fast as possible.
Cash is easy for non tech users, its secure, and it allows the customer to protect his privacy.  
I know the next generations of bitcoin users will buy BTC from machines like this; I just want to make it happen now.
@_date: 2013-08-13 03:07:22
At cash2BTC we have been working with One Time passwords for our version in mounted in a wall safe.
This way our customers running our ATM's can give one time access to unlock the device for a trusted user (say after receiving bitcoin for the cash in the unit). This way you can both receive more bitcoin to sell and empty the device.
Its not a true ATM, as its all or nothing. And if you trust the wrong person they could damage/steal the PC inside. But your btc is safe. It does solve a few issues.
We have been working with cash dispenser but they skyrocket the price of the unit. And think about it, the target demographic is small as the amount of people with BTC is small, compared to the people who might be interested in buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:24:24
early goals are large events; like trade shows, conventions, ext. leasing the devices to people interested in deploying them for very short periods (single day events ext).
@_date: 2013-05-10 08:17:23
Fincen regulations on selling bitcoin is cumbersome. In order to make sure Cash2BTC successful I need to mitigate some of the risk of operating these devices onto others.
	
“An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual 
currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter 
under FinCEN’s regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to 
the person.
	I want to be building as many devices as possible. To get bitcoin in as many customers hands as possible. To do that I feel the best way is to build my business around building, maintaing and deploying the devices rather than owning them. I am looking to pass the burden of operation to a 3rd party willing to lease the devices. Taking ownership and accountability of the transactions.
	
again we just have a working prototype; this is very early and are working very hard to build a successful business model. But it is not ready yet; was just trying to show off some pictures.
we are still working on the details but I do think we will be able to service dispenser's and still comply with FinCEN   
“(D) Physically transports currency, other monetary instruments, other commercial paper, or other value that substitutes for currency as a person primarily engaged in such business, such as an armored car, from one person to the same person at another location or to an account belonging to the same person at a financial institution, provided that the person engaged in physical transportation has no more than a custodial interest in the currency, other monetary instruments, other commercial paper, or other value at any point during the transportation;”
TLDR:  FinCen; MSB is a lot of risk and headache working with; thats why Id rather just sell the devices, and make it as easy for OTHER business to own and operate. I just want to start building the things now... 
@_date: 2013-07-02 02:06:07
all USD denominations, and over 40 other listed currencies. 
Operational flow is like this.
Customer walks up to device.
Scans a QR code of his owned address
Enters bills
has 30 seconds to enter more bills,
The json that poped up was a txhash of the completed transaction. This hash is also left on the screen for the customer at the bottom. 
This is a blockchain receipt for a successful transaction. It can be entered onto blockchain.info to verify the receipt of the bitcoin from a 3rd party as well.

@_date: 2013-09-15 04:56:46
So let’s just jump right in:
 I’ve spent a lot time working with bitcoin and SMS; sending bitcoin  is just the first step in much a deeper “rabbit hole” of what can be done with this simple technique, and simple technologies.
With TXTBitcoin you can send bitcoin to any phone number! the service automatically opens an account for any new number and immediately credits BTC you sent to that number. Now the receiver now has a SMS wallet that can send bitcoin to any bitcoin address, or even to another number. (Self-replicating wallets)
            
Currently a free .01 bitcoin is accredited to any new numbers that text the node. I will do my best to keep that going, but after the first couple hundred accounts I’m going to need to rely on donations (I’m not exactly Bill Gates after all). You would be hard pressed to think of a simpler system for bringing more users into the Bitcoin network. All funds sent to this address will automatically loaded into the fountain!
(SMS fountain* 16o94qS8ZFEoKUTrZfLd2sLhvDqLKi4hDe)
 
Phone to Phone bitcoin transfers are not recorded on the blockchain. There is currently no minimum (fee's are covered by the service automatically when sending bitcoin). Keep in mind I our service pays 1cent per SMS and the txt fee's are automatically included in the blockchain and just not reflected in accounts.    
Not everything here is completely new. Coinapult along with a handful of other services are trying offer similar SMS services, but what sets TXTBitcoin.com beyond the reach of all others is the security built into the system.
SMS is a insecure medium generally speaking. Networks can be spoofed, and this has become a global phenomenon. It would be nice to simply access your phone number with complete safety, but sadly that is simply no longer the case. With special software malicious users can pretend to be any using SMS services, but the good news is, we are in the know and prepared for this kind of activity. 
For example - If the current medium is plaintext, (not encrypted) do we have to rely on plaintext passwords to secure my coin? (for example a phone call with a PIN, or asking for a PIN)
Heck no!
The answer- OTP (One Time Passwords)
OTPs allow for users to uses a dynamic numbering system to maintain a secure connection with their wallets in a fashion that no one else, in possession of a stolen or cloned number or not, can. Sessions are timed based off of transactions, and after an allotted time a new OTP must be Validated. The idea is to get the right person, sending the right amount of bitcoin to whomever they choose and then to immediately slam the door on their way out in the face of any would be hackers.
 
The First real world Transaction I did with my SMS wallet was at the 2013 San Jose Bitcoin Convention. After waiting in line at to buy a shirt from the Freestate project (still one bad-ass t-shirt btw) they had a printed QR code, so I simply scanned it, entered it into a text, and after converting it to the price I just hit “send.” After all that unfortunately, it turned out they didn’t actually have a method to monitor the address I had sent coin to. I was able to show the Txhash of the transfer on my phone, but got little more than a chuckle at that. It turned out they had a Raspberry Pi POS some one back in NH made, but no one knew how to set it up. I told him to bring it by the Hackathon where my Text Bitcoin booth was setup and I’d take a look at it for them. Unfortunately at the time the SMS was still in early stages so I couldn’t enroll address's for monitoring confirmations. I learned from that experience and added a 3rd party address enrolling shortly after.
Since the event, I’ve started several new services and have been perusing the goal of establishing local nodes throughout as many regions as possible. I am involved locally in Liberty groups and draw on their enthusiasm to bolster my efforts as I know there is a demand for a bank-less world of trade that is more sophisticated and uncontrolled by unchecked elites with printing presses churning out fiat phony dollars in ever increasing amounts,
I believe strongly in the Bitcoin Fountain principle, that giving away small amount of coin will attract full time users once they become invested and see all the special things that can be done with a successful cypto-currency like Bitcoin. When people sign up and giving them $5-10 USD in Bitcoin they instantly recognize the monetary value of the coins and begin to think about all the fascinating stuff they can do with it. I’ve known from the beginning, Bitcoin sells itself, we as a community just needs to bring the coins into the hands of as many people as possible in order to turn their curiosity into participation.  
Get started now:
*PM if you would like to set up your own Private faucet. (To have heavier signup bonuses for friends and family) I plan setting up so you can buy private numbers through the site in the near future, but will be making nodes by hand till then. 
*Stay connected with news about our new projects and markets rapidly revolutionizing the accessibility of Bitcoin to the masses.

Hey, my names Matt and the cofounder of cash2btc
	
I am a bitcoin developer; like all of you I want to see bitcoin succeed. One of the major hurdles I have is helping people buy bitcoin. The current methods are too cumbersome; and I feel personally responsible when a service I recommend screws over my friends. Bitcoin needs to be able to flow into and out of markets easily. I think absolute best way to experience bitcoin for the first time is with an easy purchase. With our packages you can turn that old desktop you got laying around into a fully functional bitcoin dispenser. Host these devices in your living room, man cave, or around the office. With our basic package all the leg work is done for you. 
How it works
* You purchase a basic package via bitcoin from cash2btc.com
* We use bitpay same day deposits; and order your hardware as soon as it clears.
* Your account is activated on cash2btc.com and hosting setup is started.
* Bill dispenser shows up in the mail
*  download and install the client side software from cash2btc.com onto your desktop
*  plug the dispenser in via USB
*  plug in a webcam if you don’t already have one
*  open a browser and point to your hosted device page
*  insert a bill into the dispenser to test the device.
Hack together a case and a UPS and you got a portable bitcoin dispenser.
If you ever lose the device (or have it taken!) a new dispenser can be bought for a mere 252.00; I hoping for groups to get together and build cool unique cases.  I can see these deployed everything from ultralight to carry in a backpack, to large devices like a redbox.

Not entirely true, Each customer has there ***own*** hosted wallet. this service is similar to a wallet from MTgox or Coinbase. Only ours can take input from the device. (what address to send too, and how much)
The 1pct has more to do with lifetime page hosting, continued support, and the peace of mind of using our secured wallet.
Our client side software can send bill data to any DB. localhost or server, you can write your own script in any language or any implementation of the bitcoin protocol you like and have no Fee's.
(we like this because its less work for us)
