They did dox him. But doxxing people is apparently fine if you are a "journalist".

That could have done that by saying "his low-end car". Plenty of ways to get the concept across without including full details.

I wasn't talking about reddits rules. It is widely regarded as shitty to release details like peoples home addresses and details of family members due to it opening them up to harassment.
I bet these journalists would get pissed off with a bit of turnabout if they found their details all over the 'net and a bunch of people camped outside their house.

I'm not saying they should be censored, but including details like the make of car he drives etc adds nothing to the story but makes him easy to locate.
Far too many journalists don't consider the impact of their work upon the people they write about.

Sure, but I challenge the notion that "public scrutiny" requires details such as the make and model of car he drives, a picture of his house showing the number plate on his car, and name and ages of all his family members (who aren't public figures).
I have no problem with a journalist trying to get an interview with him, but they didn't consider that by publishing those details they will at least open him up to harassment, and possibly put his life in danger.
A bit of "treat others as you would have them treat you" goes a long way.

Sure, when you give a citation for "5 million+ households with a million dollars or more and they enjoy overwhelmingly little crime without the need for security forces or fortresses".
Pretty much every profile I have ever read of a millionaire has them living in an area with private security.


Most criminals are stupid.

This is the real world. The time of being able to separate the world into the Internet and the Real World, is long past.

Also, those statistics top out at "$75,000 or more" as far as I can see, which doesn't distinguish your average professionals household from a millionaires. And if I am reading that right your chance of being successfully burgled increases with income, which would back my point that millionaires need additional security.

Sure if you work for a "news site".

Yes, except those people have extensive liquid assets with which to buy security (and most rich people do employ private security). Having $400 million in bitcoin isn't the same as having $400 million in cash or stocks. There is an argument that if Satoshi tried to sell his coins the market would drop, that is if he even has the keys anymore.
