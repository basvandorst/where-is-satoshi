By legs, we mean it's not even worth half as much as when it peaked or even as much as it was last year. Hail bitcoin!


If the global economy collapses, how would you send an electronic payment to Hawaii and who would be there to accept it on your behalf? And even if you could, why would they sell it to you? And why would they accept your fiat money over the fiat money they already have? 


You forgot supreme commander. And...why are you dictating this? 


Therefore ensuring only the most corrupt and wealthy people have all the power.


Oh I get it! This is just another bitcoin scam. Well, I can see that. For a moment I thought you were stupid AND crazy.


Let's see, already this government is going to be based upon a very unstable currency, whose price no longer has the dollar to hang onto. And this currency will also require that you perform transactions online, which if the economy collapses to such a state that bitcoiners are able to try a take over of US territory, such a system will no longer exist. Hell the lack of power will kill bitcoin in its sleep.


But if the dollar collapses this hard that you have the opportunity to buy Hawaii, how are you even sure we'll have a USA anymore? Alright, alright. Whatever, US Citizen or at least, former--fair?


Oh dear...I see where this is going. Better hurry up with the post bro. I think I see your wife sneaking out of the kitchen. 


Soooo...like 70% of bitcoiners then?


You gay bro?


Jesus was black.


Oh, so we can always get someone new in to change the laws and make sure that after the initial collapse of society, that minorities can get a fair shake too, right?


Ah, nevermind then. 


When you sneak out to meet your 17 year old lover, does he pretend to be the girl, or do you? 


Surprise, surprise, you think you get to be supreme commander. We should report you for treason, you worthless piece of shit. Hope your NRA-registered assault rifle will protect you from an artillery shell fired from several miles away.

What you mean is "you the consumer, get to decide how I'll sucker you today". 


Exactly, so why would I ever want to use a currency that isn't accepted and why in the world, would I use a "currency" that's labeled as a stock by the IRS?


Why? Because it's pointless? Inflation can happen for many reasons, but just on the reason of an increasing population, you will find that you need more money. Individual wealth in terms of what a dollar is worth is on the decline, but only because there are more people, so we need more money to go around.
Bitcoin has the same issue, except its method is less intuitive; you have more people adopting, so you just break the coins into smaller pieces. You're still suffering a loss of value per unit, but instead of using positive numbers (which is better for individuals, since a dollar to them is a positive thing they can more easily understand), you're giving them fractions of a bitcoin or a percent, which ties it to how many people are using it and hence, less intuitive as the number keeps getting smaller and having to adjust itself. It makes the holder of the cash do the math that they're not good at, in a fashion that isn't as readily understandable.
Certainly a government can screw itself with inflation, but some inflation is good and is in fact, needed for a growing economy. All you're doing is changing the direction of the numbers, not the actual numbers themselves.

2) Your kid doesn't get an A because he's a "straight A" student. He gets A's by actually getting it right. Stop poisoning your kid.
3) Assigning your kid a new assignment was unfair, but look at this from the teacher's POV; she told kids to write about some new, innovative technology. Kid talks about a 6-year old technology that has yet to cash in on ANY of its promises and appears to have reached a dead end. The kid isn't even talking about the technology itself; but rather a brand. Cryptocurrencies in fact, were conceived as early as 1996, when the NSA published the concept. At best, were talking about a technology that has existed for 18 years.

@_date: 2014-10-15 17:15:33
But it isn't equal. Yes, the rules are the same, but without restrictions and safety nets put in place over decades/centuries of use, you have people who like to manipulate the market and it has no backing by any sort of government. No one even treats bitcoin as currency and its future is doubtful because it can't inflate, just deflate. Each bitcoin will have to become more worthless as our population increases or you get a larger adoption base. And what makes this inherently more valuable than other crypto-currencies? Nothing. It's just authenticated data. One that requires a shitload of energy to produce, rather than just a cheap-ass printing press.
I can appreciate what you're going for, but bitcoin is inherently limited in scope. 
In any case, yes, this guy is probably going to be on the FTC's shit list. He'd better wise up now and reform if he wants to avoid having that hammer shoved straight up his ass.

The US isn't falling. It suffered a recent economical recession which it has slowly (more slowly than it could have, thanks to political infighting) pulled itself out of and is now recovering. The US is going to remain the world's foremost greatest power in the foreseeable future simply due to geopolitics. 
Basically, the US is the center of all the world's trade, which occurs mostly by sea. Look at a map. Now realize that it isn't an accurate representation of the world. Pull it closer with the US in the middle. Because the US's Navy secured all the shipping areas of the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. 
In other words, when the Asian markets are in bad shape, we trade out the Atlantic. When the Europeans are in poor condition, we trade with the Asians. When our economy tanks, theirs tanks. The US could and has been run by some of the most incompetent leaders and it will continue to maintain power, simply because of our location. 
It's all about trade. The US Navy protects all the major shipping routes around the world for free through multiple alliances (as in, we give an alliance where we protect other people's ships, not that we use their ships to assist ours) and since almost half of the US is actually interconnected through waterways (naturally, I might add), it's really cheap for us to transport things across our continent than say, Europe.
The US would have to suffer a complete and total internal political meltdown (read; not gonna happen) in order for this disadvantage to be removed. The internal strife we see now is growing pains, as well as some greedy groups trying to avoid fiscal responsibility and political leaders trying to maintain their power by playing to their groups desires and greed.
It will, eventually work itself out because it is in all parties eventual interest, but much of it is the older generations, who have lived fairly long thanks to advancing medical technologies, who refuse to step down and let young blood in (30 and 40 year olds).

You really have no idea what it's like to live in a police state. A police state is where basically the government can walk into your home and do whatever they want and you really can't say anything. Curfews, strong display of police on every corner, and so on and so forth. 
Now, have there been breaches in the freedom of private citizens? Yes, yes there has. The NSA did something pretty shitty--to be honest, not exactly surprised and to be even more honest, I'd have been surprised if they weren't, but the NSA looking through metadata or even emails is not the same as a police state.

@_date: 2014-10-25 05:01:01
Listen to your parents. 
Bitcoin is not a good idea. You're basically just gambling with your money in a pyramid scheme, which is the dumbest thing you could do. Think about it, what is bitcoin supposed to be? Well, it's supposed to be currency. Okay, why should it be currency? Well, typically because it would be a medium of exchange, but as a medium of exchange, it simply fails. Few places accept it, it's difficult for the average person to use, and it's so easy to lose bitcoin just by not protecting your own web browser properly. And if someone decides to sell you something, you have no means of getting your bitcoin back if they decide not to send you the goods. 
Well, is bitcoin a stock then? Well, no. A stock is when you invest in a company. And this is where you here a lot of bitcoin jargon thrown around, like getting in on the ground floor, then becoming rich. But, the thing is, companies tend to increase in value over time, save for when they go under. But bitcoin isn't a company, you aren't paying a company money and then making money when they do well (since stock is basically you owning a part of the company). 
All you're doing is speculating. You're hoping to get in while it's relatively cheap and then make a fortune when it shoots up. But at the same time, you're also getting screwed, because basically, bitcoins are worthless. I mean, think about it. If you buy gold--well, everyone values gold; it can make jewelry, currency, electronics, statues, and whatever. Or well, apples. What do apples do? Well, you and other people can eat them, so people will continue to buy apples.
What does bitcoin do? Well...nothing. It just (or is at least supposed to) sounds cool. What can I use a bitcoin for? To buy apples? I can already buy apples with cash or credit/debit. I also don't have to go through various middlemen to do so or go through a bunch of hoops just to use either of those. I also have more protection from the government in case my cash is stolen or I'm swindled.
Ask yourself, what does bitcoin give you that modern currency methods don't? It isn't private (it's all on the block chain!), it isn't convenient (limited transactions, limited vendors), it isn't revolutionary (what a fucking joke), it isn't safe (countless raids from other collectors, unstable marketplaces that steal consumer coins, danger of 51% control from large miner groups), and it just isn't supported (the US government and most others do not value it, hence you can't be assured payment will be accepted).

Bitcoin lesson; its okay to lie and slander people if it pushes your goals.
@_date: 2014-11-05 08:30:08
That would never work.
You're basically asking someone to give up a competitive edge. And really, it points to a basic, inherent flaw in bitcoin; the more people adopt it, the harder it gets. Generally, when a product is mined (like say, gold, silver, and so forth) it becomes easier to mine because new tools are developed, better understanding is developed, and so on. The difficulty has never increased, only the number of people trying to harness it.
With bitcoin, in order to avoid a 51%+ attack, you need to scale the entire system into an absurd number game. It's like playing 3rd edition D&amp;D at 150th level--the numbers are too high and too stupid to  do anything and anyone new trying to get in at 1st is just fucked.

So what? Everyone has strategies. You think the US doesn't consider what the Chinese might do, what they're able to do? And how they might counter that? Of course, the Chinese are going to take it another step and think, what might the Americans do and what are they able to do? And back and forth.
Claiming "they have a strategy for that" is pretty silly. Not to mention, even if China managed to protect its bays, it wouldn't do them much good. The US can still more or less blockade all the shipping routes just outside its territorial waters and with bases located in SK and Japan, the US has a lot of weight over there. 
And even if China DOES manage to get its ships out without them getting sunk (good luck getting people to volunteer for that after the 12th one goes down), China can't trade with the US--the US is the center of the network. That was the entire point. If the US says China can't trade, even without using military force, then China can't use America to trade and then it basically has to go the long way.
Don't get me wrong, the US isn't some sort of superhero. In fact, the US's crippling weakness is that the US doesn't think ahead and overreacts. But this is because it doesn't need to think. Geopolitics, as they are and in the near-future, doesn't require us to think. We can basically do almost whatever we want.
That said, it's believed that within 10-20 years, the US is going to stop interfering in other cultures due to greater amounts of independence and the fact that we no longer need the network we created to keep use safe and powerful. 
To conclude, China is not a threat to the US. It has many internal and nearby external problems that leaves China as being incapable of acting as a world power. That doesn't mean China doesn't have weight to throw around; it does. It has done so by turning itself into a cheap exportation nation. 
But as it stands, China cannot hope to contend with a US that is intent on keeping them blockaded. Of course, merely not trading with them is enough to deliver a large blow to the Chinese economy. The global recession we caused should have indicated that much.

But bitcoin lures people into believing its safe. That's the problem. Everyone knows you have to protect it. People say bitcoin is safe and that's why it's better than fiat. Except, as it turns out, it actually isn't and has the glaring weakness of fewer means of getting your cash back. There's no bank to try and catch that money for you. There's no bank to try and prevent someone from getting your cash if they manage to hack it. There's no bank to prevent people from trying a middleman attack.
Banks are, for the most part, safe places to keep money. Bitcoin is not, with the added difficulty of having to upload gigabytes of data to use it, takes longer or shorter to process depending upon the current miners, is difficult to use, is not widely accepted, and has no backing by any major government institution. In fact, it has pretty much been declared a non-cash as its treated more of a stock or product.
So...why should I switch? There is no compelling reason. It isn't private (blockchain), it isn't intuitive, it isn't easy, and it isn't usable anywhere that I care about.

@_date: 2014-10-14 21:01:36
Eh, not really geeks. There are a couple types of people that do like bitcoin, but it isn't really about the technology, that's just a shiny sheen. The people who care are the following:
Ideologists: People who don't like banks or hate big government love bitcoin. A lot of Bitcoin's face is based in the ideology of it; that it's private (it isn't), it can't be taxed (it is--the miner's that maintain the system), that it can't be stolen (constantly is), and that the government can't take it away from you (they can). 
The Greedy and the Desperate: Basically, people who want to make money off bitcoin. In other words, the only reason why people are at all interested in bitcoin. Most people see it as a rising stock and think if they can get in on the ground floor, they can cash out and walk away as millionaires. Unfortunately, they seem to forget that everyone else pretty much has the same idea. 
This category includes the pumpers and the chumps. And sadly, those same chumps will then also turn into pumpers, since they need other chumps to hold the bag that they've just been handed. So everyone on these forums talks about how great bitcoin is, how it's new currency, even if they're just in it to get rich.
Criminals: Bitcoin is pretty useful for drugs and other illegal things, despite the blockchain, since it's only a problem if they can attribute the account to someone, which takes time and effort to track down. They're the ones who probably give the "currency" its only real value and are probably the ones most harmed when the price rapidly fluctuates.

@_date: 2014-11-14 05:17:09
See, you say that, but almost a year later, bitcoin is down by over 60%. Somehow, you dolts think that just because we're hitting close to when it was worth over a thousand last year, that it will magically jump right back up. While certain purchasing patterns reoccur, especially due to the holidays, I don't see why you think this will cause bitcoin prices to soar.
I mean, it's like assuming that just because x game was hot last year, that same game will be hot again this year. Why? Everyone who wanted it last year has already bought it. Sure, on some things you will see a repeat spike, but your chances of hitting the same prices again is just laughable. And what happens when you reach past the holiday season? Gonna drop like a rock.
I seriously do not see how you think the price is recovering.

Well, I don't mean it literally, but holy shit. This is the presentation these two presented to experts in economics? The first half is insulting; I would maybe show it to preschoolers. Seriously, what sort of bullshit is this?
"Money can't be a gas."
Gee, no shit.
And it's technically wrong too. Anything that people value as a means of transaction is currency. It isn't particularly good currency, so that isn't done. But the level of arrogance it takes to write that down and go "yeah, these old farts will get me!" requires your head to be so far up your own ass that you could scratch your neck with your tailbone. 
Then the last half is like a really, really bad joke. Seriously? The chain allowing for the creation of AI? Was he fucking high when he wrote that? I mean, I've seen some people say some really silly things about what bitcoin can do, but how is the blockchain going to allow for the creation of AI, when the best anyone has been able to do so far is only the most simplistic learning computer by top computer companies with some of the best minds in the business?
Small wonder they were tripping over each other to get to the doors. These two are just terrible. Did you read that shit? Seriously. Roadcoin? Carcoin? Why in blue fucks do you need a fucking coin name for every fucking thing in existence? Or why the holy shit would your fucking toaster or fridge need to become economical players? It's absurdity.

The problem being that most people tend to tip so few bits that it equates to something like $0.00006 or something like that. Most no one is going to waste time and effort trying to figure out how to collect a few fractions of a penny. Even at around $7 an hour, a person's worth of work is deemed at around 11.667 cents a minute. Why would they waste even 116.667 cents in ten minutes trying to figure out how to collect even 30 cents? 
@_date: 2014-11-17 03:36:06
It's like you enjoy being robbed.
Listen to me, don't be a fucking fool. How many coins do you have? One or two? Sell them now. It's at $401. Trust me, they won't be able to keep the inflation up for long. Every time it gets harder for these guys to pump the value. If you want to make a profit and hold till $420, then do that, but for the love of God, don't throw away your money. 
You are being scammed. Seriously. I know it's fun to laugh at your bad choices, but now I'm trying to help you. You can get out. Just think about it objectively; should you ever trust anything that sounds too good to be true? There are threads here with people who bought in at $1,000.

Get. Out.

Of course not. Because these people have been pumped and they realize they're getting dumped. So they're desperately trying to pump you and other prospective chumps to get cash. Bitcoin is terrible as a currency because it's hard to use and has so many more drawbacks than cash or electronic payments. Its advantages are just so...uninteresting.
It has no safety and no one around the country, save a few businesses trying to cash in on the trade, who accept it. And even then THEY never accept it; they use a middleman who takes the bitcoins off your hand and gives them real cash.
It's the beanie-babies of this past decade for online nerds. I say that as an online nerd. Don't let these people swindle you. If you've invested a bit of money, just drop it; it's gone. If you've invested lots of money, get out and save what you can.

Even my grandmother, who knows nothing about computers, is smart enough to get someone experienced enough with them to do something she doesn't understand.


Yeah, no. Let's look at actual evidence, shall we?


Wow, nice spelling. You do know those red lines beneath the words mean that it's either unrecognizable or it's misspelled, right? You should double check them from time to time. But don't mind me, I can't read. 
Anyway, this is you, making a claim. You are talking down to Rub3x because he's just stating his "opinion". Which is funny, because you use the words 'inefficient' and 'unscalable', which is generally not how you express that. Insubstantial would have been a better choice. And simply putting two mildly large words next to each other in a sentence, doesn't really make you sound smarter. You look like the dumbass who wears a helmet over his helmet, because that makes you safer, right? Right?


Funny, seems here you were trying to prove someone wrong. And before you backpeddle, you just said "I didn't intend to prove anything". 
Then Rub3x nails your sorry ass to his wall, to which you cry:


This proves that you're either incredibly stupid, so stupid that you aren't even smart enough to stick to words that you do understand and try to speak with them or that you're too stupid to know how to back-peddle. Which, I admit, is very hard to do on the internet.

Why? Even if it does climb back up to $400, it's not going to stay. Your best bet in making a profit is that it spikes for a bit and allows you to get out. The price of bitcoin has been plummeting since January. Desk shows that there have been jumps up, but otherwise there appears to be a strong downward trend. 
It's funny that people think the Christmas season is going to help bitcoin. It won't. Sure, you'll see more volume of transactions, but this will probably be mostly from or for bitcoiners, rather than wider adoption. Most people, I suspect, are going to be rather tight with their wallets as they're spending money on things people actually want.

Yes, I'm serious. Dead serious. Bitcoin is a scam. Mt. GOX manipulated the price from day one and when they went under, people just kept on using their BS market price. For the past few months, the price has dropped like a rock and only the desperate will of the bagholders (the people who got scammed) has kept the price from falling.
Just a month or so ago, they collectively paid out 9 million to one of the larger bitcoin holders to keep the price from bottling out. Bitcoin is   like a ship that is not seaworthy, only currently held afloat by people trying to pour the water out with a bucket line.

No, everything in life has risks. That does not make it gambling. Gambling is about taking risks, yes--so the two are closely related, they are not however, the same. You do not say someone is "taking a gamble" by crossing a safe road in a safe way. You're only saying they're "taking a gamble" when they are doing something high-stakes. 


Really? Because it seems to me that all the smart people have already cashed out and left everyone else holding worthless currency. And yes, it is a currency.


I don't always want open and transparent for the whole world to see what I buy. 


You keep saying "digital cash".
Currency is cash. Hell, it's in the name "crypto-currency". 


Yes, a handful of people accept it. And they're typically working through middlemen who accept bitcoin and pay them cash. This is not the same as me handing over cash for pizza or computer parts.


No, people invest to make a profit--not necessarily to get rich. Typically the people in it to get rich are too greedy to see the forest through the trees.


Yeah...trust-less concepts tend not to work to well. There needs to be some level of trust with other people in a system in order to make things work. It's the trust in the US dollar that makes it powerful. It's the trust in bitcoin's value that it well...holds value. 


Yes, explain to me how something can be money, but not currency.


Then why the fuck do I want it?
 &gt;Bitcoin is made for the digital online age.
It's called any major bank, card company, or payapl.


Fuck peer to peer. You keep saying that like it should mean something to me. It doesn't. Yes, I know what it is. But it does not hold value to me. And I sure as hell don't trust it if I have to keep uploading more data to my hard-drive just to make it work. 
And I can get that through (sans the peer to peer thing) from my Visa card. And when the mining ceases to produce bitcoins, you can sure as hell bet the miners are going to be charging more to make up for their lost "profits". 


I buy shit off of paypal all the time. I pay for the product, shipping, and soon taxes. If I pay for a fee for credit card transactions, I sure as hell haven't noticed it. 


...Do you know what a fucking currency is?


That's why it's terrible!


Yes well, you don't even know what currency is, so how is that going to convince me? And how is peer-to-peer transactions convenient for me? In order to assure information that I normally don't bother with, I have to download gigabytes of information (the ledger) and it will grow with every transaction. Why is that any use to me? It's just a big load of bullcrap I don't want to deal with.
No, it's fact. 


Except these are ALL the major players, aren't they? Mt. Gox was the one that really gave bitcoin its leg-up and they were scamming you chumps probably from day one. And recently litecoins were stolen by another group. 


Yes, but they also tend to not make up the majority of businesses and services that bitcoin offers.


No, because I'm not an idiot and don't 
A) Carry exceptionally large amounts of cash on me.
B) I have a debit/credit card, which is protected by the bank to prevent unusual transactions. 
C) It can't be easily as stolen from someone at a distance.


And I'm sure people will howl and scream about it.


Lol, why would they? You don't seem to understand how this works. If that one mining pool decides that say, the Bitcoin Foundation and all its members are a cancer, then you are fucked. And what makes you think the miners will just leave at that second? What's everyone else going to do? Cry? They don't even have to be overt about it; they can simply deny them.


No, they sold it because they knew chumps would buy them.


Yes well, Germany has also valued gas chambers. More importantly, they're not the world super power and what they value only matters in Germany and their neighbors. 


Not sure how it works in Germany, but in the US, if it's legal tender, you have to accept it as a form of payment (though you can of course, refuse service). And your argument is only an attempt at a technicality. If I was in Europe, I'd be using the legal currency there. Not glorified monopoly money.

It'd be the most accurate to say that the white breed has been more fortunate than others and successful when it needed to be, but this doesn't prove that we're better.


He's totally not a racist you guys.
Also, we all know the black hoodlums will shoot each other.


Because bitcoinia only likes the black stick on holidays and valentines day.

It's also a bad habit to get into, even if it never spells financial disaster. But look, if you want to toss in forty bucks to let it ride and see what happens, sure, be my guest. 


It won't happen anytime soon. It'd also be dangerous as hell. Are you aware of the 51% danger? Of how a large enough mining group could control transactions if they obtained 51% of greater of the total hashing power? Think what would happen if the US adopted bitcoin--then do you realize how easy it'd be for another rival to try and undermine US transactions by getting a greater hashing power? 
Someone like China, Russia, or whoever with that much hashing power could cancel national payments--even international ones. And they could then end up extorting us with little recourse other than reverting or changing our currency or war.
That may not happen, but when you're adopting a new currency, you have to look at it from all angles. The US doesn't want bitcoin and will never adopt it on a massive scale, because it is vulnerable to other powers attempting to hi-jack it. There's also the problem of an increasing hash-size; every transaction is recorded and it all has to be copied onto every machine that's part of bitcoin. In other words, you're going to create a massive burden upon consumers to store gigabytes, soon to be terabytes and exabytes on their hardware. It's just such a massive, inefficient burden that's required for peer to peer designs.


but what do i know, i'm just a young pup!!!
The US isn't really tyrannical. I mean yes, it has pulled some really dirty shit, but this isn't new for the US. It's just another portion of the government where people have obtained too much power and are abusing it. The US has had this issue before. Be thankful it's not nearly as violent as it used to be (ie, entire worker towns being forced at gunpoint to work for corporations, with the US military being the guns for hire in some cases). The Snowden thing is honestly...not even surprising. Maybe it's just my generation, but the US government spying on me has never come to me as a surprise.
I'm 26 by the way, so I'm not exactly was wise as the mountains, but I'm just telling you, this is tulip mania all over again. 


Well, you tell yourself that, but it's easy to get swept up. My advice? If you do this, just drop in a one-time purchase and let it ride. Forty bucks and you never buy more. No matter how good it looks. If the price shoots up, then you can sell and maybe come away with $80 or $160. Or $0.40.
But for the love of God, whatever you do, do not try to mine for bitcoin. Ever. Seriously, if your parents ever find out you're wasting electricity and running computer parts like that into the dirt, they will probably kill you.

Yes, apparently the night he got a wee-bit too tipsy.
All crude jokes aside, why didn't you just get them a fraction of a bitcoin? And it really isn't important technology. It's not even new. It was developed at least around 1996 by the NSA and is marginally interesting as far as economics go. Outside of that...not that big of a deal and it certainly isn't something to invest in as bitcoin or anything that will change the world on a massive scale.

@_date: 2014-09-21 19:31:13
Holy shit, I cannot stop laughing. Yes Rhader, the bitcoin is the most revolutionary technology since the internet! Holy shit, what a joke. Are you serious with that shit? Bitcoins were invented in 2008, right? Or 2009? Well, let's do 2008, shall we?
In 2008, they finished constructing the first commercially available bionic hand:
Or how about the Synthetic Organism?
Or how about the advancement of possible FTL technology? Or the new prototype touch screens, that will be able to create actual physical textures for you to use, then sink back into a smooth surface? Or how about the possibilities of solar roads? 
Bitcoin can't even hold as a stable currency, which was invented thousands of years ago. It's only claim to fame is that it's digital, decentralized (despite everyone's best efforts--aka, Mt GOX), and impossible to fake. 
It's a glorified debit card. Except not, because I can actually buy shit with my debit card.
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:56:19

Lol, China? Their power is simply in exports. If the US wanted to (and if it wanted to suffer another economical hit--which it could), it could blockade China and watch as the country withered in a matter of months. China needs exports. It simply cannot survive without them. It has turned its once greatest advantage into its greatest weakness.
That's not even mentioning all the local powers that hates China's guts, several of which are good and chummy with the US.

Also, this seems pretty selfish in motivation, if you just want to do this just to get your hands on what you believe is a valuable asset. You are there to work for your boss, not take advantage of the situation to obtain some bitcoin on the side, then filling the till so you can get it on the cheap.

That's the scam. You get a sucker to buy worthless internet cash that isn't really cash, as it is stock, then you run off with their cash, while proclaiming how profitable it is to use said currency.
As the current sucker, your best option is to convince other people to buy your coins, then run with it. All while hoping someone doesn't screw you with fake gift cards (don't accept gift cards), fake checks (always get a cashier's check), and trying to swindle you out of coins before they actually pay you.
Good luck!

@_date: 2014-11-05 22:21:00
No, it's the poorly designed bitcoin that has resulted in this. Someone else is always going to want a higher hashrate and that is the typical person's assumption. So if they give up their hashrates, then their competition gets a leg up and there's nothing from stopping the selfish miner from outdoing them.
Shortsighted, yes. But you can't really stop it now. Bitcoin should have not have scaled the way it has.

Unlikely. 
Australia would tighten restraints again if it appears that the Chinese are attempting to displace them. Furthermore, a lot of people in China aren't well off enough to just up and move to Australia. Certainly not enough to upset the local population. And the US bought Alaska, we didn't usurp it. I mean, we usurped most of our land from the natives and bought other swaths from countries...but yeah, didn't steal Alaska.

It's funny, because that's not what a lot of bitcoiners say. They keep on preaching about how it's going to ruin banks and take over the world. 


Not it isn't. Only a few places support bitcoin and they use middlemen. I can go to Dell and buy a computer with my debit card. 


Lol? I purchase things with my debit card all the time, such as DLCs that cost only a couple of bucks. Never really got hit hard for that and most places allow you to set up accounts that allow you to make the same purchases easier without going through the entire hassle.

Stop trying to ignore the point by preaching. The point is, if someone finds that bitcoin is a stupid idea with no merit, challenging them to make one of their own is pointless, because they find the entire concept to be stupid in the first place. It's akin to someone saying that video games are stupid, then having a gamer telling them to make a game of their own. It fails, simply because the they hold no value in video games to begin with.
You've only proven your own stupidity. 
As for the blockchain--tulips are actually valuable. Just because there is SOME value in the technology of a blockchain, it doesn't mean it's going to make bitcoin valuable or revolutionize anything like you seem to think it will. If it does something, then it does something. Stop treating it like the holy grail you fool.

Oh yeah, I'm the idiot. 
Nor does it actually address my point. Bitcoin is useless as a currency because for the most part, you can't really buy anything with it and it requires a massive fucking network that currently requires gigabyte hardrive space and I still need to pay transaction fees when I use it! Hell, so long as I use MY bank, I don't get fined for sending money, either through a purchase or sending money to someone else's account on another bank. It's only if I use another bank's ATM that I take it in the ass. And even then, if I need cash that badly, it's probably worth the charge.
But go ahead jackass, how about you actually explain your position of why it's so great--oh wait, that's right, you're on the fence. Okay, EXPLAIN why you're on the fence.

I didn't get charged, FBI didn't come knocking. That being said, my coinbase account seemed to be black listed - any purchases further purchases wouldn't go through, and support said I was naughty and I would need to provide some shit from my bank if I wanted to resume purchases.
Needless to say, this was fucking genius.

No it's hurting other people. Including you idiots. I'm at no risk at all to bitcoin's issues, given that I don't partake in it. 


Tulips actually functioned for their purposes though; growing. You can't really say the same about bitcoin. Because it's also massively slow and prone to competition. And as soon as those bitcoins are all mined, you can expect there to be some charges in order to transfer your money. You're fooling yourselves if you don't think there's going to be a fee spike at some point.


Sorry, but you can't win the day with "lowest cost!". No one gives a shit if your system costs less if it's less secure, slower, is harder to understand, and harder to use. In addition, this cost system is usually eaten by the merchant and then passed onto the consumer via sold goods. So the consumer doesn't have to worry about a transfer fee in addition to taxes and the like--it's already been taken into account.


Which is why your currency has yet to raise the vast majority of you out of the proverbial gutter. Nor do you even have a right to talk about efficiency--bitcoin is the least efficient system there is. It fucking has to be due to its nature; it's a decentralized system. While that makes it harder to attack and harder to control, it also means it's also a great deal less efficient than a larger bank. 


Alright, provide evidence to show why this is the case. I want an professional economical source--any single one, that endorses bitcoin as gaining more 'wealth' over fiat-based economies. Healthy ones too, not one from a nation in economical trouble. 


Because no one wants it. Even the companies that accept bitcoin don't actually accept it; they've using middlemen who transform it into fiat first. In other words, in order for you to get your goods, you have to pay fiat for bitcoins, give the bitcoins to a middleman, who then exchanges them for fiat, to pay the company, who then gives you the product.
Efficiency? I don't think so.
And not to mention no one sane wants to be paid in bitcoin; because its value immediately changes by several dollars worth in a matter of hours. It isn't backed up by any sort of nation. It is not user-friendly. It has a set value that means if a country does start using bitcoins and those bitcoins are stolen, said country has effectively lost its entire wealth to someone else. Do you know how fucking dangerous that is? How insane it is?




Nope. Not a single fucking dime. 
Well, minus the cost of my tax payer money going to fix the victims of this scam. But really, if it's not one thing, it's another. 


You mean as the price is plummeting? It's amazing how desperate you people are. Even after a month or so of constant pumping, of getting people ready for Black Friday--it was a complete and utter disaster. And after the holiday season, bitcoin is even worse shape. You've reached the point now where no matter how far you pump, it takes more money and more energy just to bring it up to previous levels. I wonder, how long can you people pump it up to 300 again, before it tanks? A month? Two?


Nah. I can actually go out and have a life and forget that this exists, then come back 2-4 weeks later because I have absolutely nothing riding on this.

Interesting how this has gone from a discussion on money laundering laws to me somehow fighting progress and the future. Could you at least be creative with your pathetic strawmen?


Lol. No, I just don't give a flying fuck about some obscure cryptocurrencies. I literally juts waltz in here to laugh at your stupid schemes. You could replace it with gold for all I care.
Actual technological progression has made leaps and bounds beyodn what bitcoin could ever hope to see. Fuck, the US Navy Rail Gun and laser devices are going to have a much more massive affect upon the future than your joke of a currency.


You do realize I read over your stupid cult because I enjoy your repeated failures and suffering? 


I don't doubt that's what you'd like to happen. You'd like nothing better to find a sucker to get rich off. Sorry asswipe, you'll have to go shill to someone else.

Because of chumps like who you were convinced it would drastically rise in price, so you bought in hoping to make a quick buck. Same thing with Tulip Mania; the price skyrocketed, people were duped, and once they lost out, the prices of tulips dropped back to its normal value. The same is probably happening with bitcoin.
The only reason bitcoin survives to this day is because there are lots of reasons why people joined into bitcoin, from criminal reasons to anti-government reasons. But its main driving force has always been the hopes of obtaining more fiat. And now everyone left holding bitcoins after the money was made (or rather, redistributed) is left throwing more cash at the machine to make it work.
But it can't sustain itself. Whether you can keep it going for the next 2 years or the next 20 years is unimportant; bitcoin will probably not survive because it requires a fresh source of users, who will not see any reasons to switch over in mass. Nor will they want to work with bitcoin itself as more and more regulations are placed on its "infrastructure". They'll move to altcoins to avoid taxation or get illegal goods.
Litecoin and Dogecoin are in even worse positions.

So you're scamming people.
Basically, if I understand this, let's say that here, a bitcoin is worth $250.  You then take an order that is worth $250 here and selling it to someone on local bitcoins in their area, which is worth $300 there and scooping up the extra $50.
So you're a lying piece of shit. You are charging people. You're just taking advantage of the receiving party's ignorance about the price difference.
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:00:39
So let's see here...
1) Limited functionality that rivals have had for ~10 years.
2) Unnecessary requirements that don't make sense for its platform.
3) Even when working within its intended, limited functionality, it still has massive bugs and system failures.
4) Apparent trouble getting it to work with the rest of bitcoin/bitcoin products.
5) Wasted countless hours without getting better use out of the device.
6) You're selling the product because it has failed you in every way.
And your rating for it 5/10--WHAT?!
5/10 is a "it's okay, not great, but it gets the job done". Evne a 3/10 would be "it's not very good, but it's cheap and gets it done...most of the time".
This thing sounds like a piece of shit that someone dumped into a box and sent you for dirty fiat.

I'm tempted to say that you'd produced a creative strawman, but then I realized exactly how intellectually bankrupt it really is. No, that is not my contention at all. Nor was it the point of the discussion. 
You need a license, to show that you are complaint with state regulations and laws that prevent murder and pedophilia. By trying to cut out those regulations and laws, you're allowing those activities to become safer for the ones who commit the crime. 
You are in fact, arguing for the world to be a safer place for pedophiles and murderers because you don't like the inconveniences that said regulations and laws put upon the rest of us. 
But I suppose when you're stupid enough to think that fucking bitcoin will change the world and leaving you filthy rich, you're really too fucking stupid to put forth a proper argument.

Why is anyone here surprised? If you asked someone in late 2013 or in early 2014 what it was, they'd say "oh, that digital currency on the news? I've heard of that" and if you asked them a bit later about it they'd say "the one with the crashing economy? Sounds like a scam" and if you were to ask them now, most seem to say "A what? Bitcoin? Never heard of it."
Face it fellas. No one wants your shitty currency anymore. All you're doing is trying to keep the ship from sinking another ten minutes while the rats jump ship.

No it isn't. The NSA had the idea back in 1997. It's been like, about 18 years since they published that. The idea was basically dropped. And Satoshi simply put together a working platform of the idea for public consumption.
To put simply, bitcoin has no intrinsic value. We already have a fairly reliable system already, which has the backing of the US government, multiple banking institution, and hundreds of millions of users.

Except people learned about bitcoin in 2013 and 2014. What, do you think everyone else lives under a rock? That's why you had such mass spikes at the end of 2013 and at the beginning of 2014. And guess what? People stopped caring. They only remember it as 'that nerdy internet money' or 'drug money'. 
Bitcoin is a dying entity. It will never be a world currency. At best, it'll devolve into a black market. If you were going to get worldwide adoption, it would have started this past year. You'd be rich as thousands of people started adopting it.
But you aren't. All you're doing is trying to keep people from leaving long enough to hope that you can start Bubble 2.0 to try and recapture their interest (you won't) or to cash out while you've still made bank on it (very unlikely now). 
And to give you an idea of how well connected the people in the modern world are--realize how quickly Gangum Style became a thing. And that was just a shitty, catchy song. Stop living under the belief that no one knows what bitcoin is and that mass adoption is around the corner once people realize what this is.

No shit dumbfuck, that's why we have methods in place to catch it. Perhaps that simple point escaped you.


Except cash ALSO has to be exchanged in person and there are security cameras in most places that can help capture the culprit. And a license also allows officers to arrest individuals who launder money in cash, hence why it's risky to money launder with just cash.


And again, this has NOTHING to do with the discussion, which is punishing money laundering. Bitcoin, credit cards, cash...it doesn't change the fact that if you pull this shit, you're gonna get arrested.


Why would anyone have an inferiority complex in regard to bitcoin? Your media coverage died with Gox, who sodomized you like a cheap joy-boy. The perceived value of bitcoin is just hovering over $200. No one wants to touch your filthy "currency" because it's connected to drug use and fanatics. No one gives a fuck about bitcoin, because they think it's something weird that nerds do (thanks for the shit by the way). And no one wants to even bother because it's overly complicated, inferior, and more risky for them (why would the consumer, who is the majority, adopt a monetary system that's more of a risk to them?).
Your shitty E-Cash drains so much power that it's just plain unfeasible from the get-go. Already it consumes an intolerable level of power. What makes you think we're going to accept it, just so a few fucktard hipsters can be at the top of the food chain?

A country has to enforce its borders or no one will take it seriously. So it   will either force the plane to land where it wants them to land, detain, Ver, and kick him back out, or it will force the plane to leave. This was something they were discussing with Snowden and why he was basically stuck in Russia; because if he takes a plane that goes over allied air space, they will have it land, arrest him, and hand him over to the US.

And it will result in what happened last time; you sustain 300-400 for a while, maybe a month, then it struggles, drops, and drops, and drops.

Things naturally centralize. Because they are an efficient and effective design. The more decentralize a system is, the more energy it is going to need and the less efficient it will be. 


Except bitcoin isn't any better. Because you already have people exploiting how bitcoin works or how people use bitcoin to steal and plunder their savings. And despite your protest, you dumbasses have been placing money into exchanges and scams like there's no tomorrow. 
And without that centralized authority, there is no one who can monitor or regulate the currency. There is no one to adjust for inflation and there's no one who can change the rules to better fit society.


Which is why there are laws and regulations in place that place responsibility upon them. As for Target's debacle, while it's unfortunate, it's not like they were giving that information away--their system was hacked and it was stolen by scumbags. And if you want to play that game, numerous bitcoiners on this very subreddit have reported losses because someone breached their own security.
So either way, security is going to be breached. 


First off, that's not true. Currently, it is only a few cents. But once miners can't make money off mining, they're going to start charging more. That's built into your own system. Nor is it an easy or trusted system. Price volatility and the fact that there's no trust--I can't trust that the other person won't run off with my bitcoins if I send them to him and he can't trust I'll pay him if I don't send him the bitcoins first.
With the current legal system, there are protections in place for everyone. 


But I'm not a merchant, so it isn't my problem. And that's exactly the way the world looks at it; if it isn't a customer problem, then no one cares. Because any smart business is going to use the most convenient means of getting people in and out the door. Bitcoin does not provide that. 


No, my opinion is that bitcoin is a shitty, pathetic system that has no future. These are backed up by facts. Like its dropping value, it's complete and utter lack of traction, it's inability to function as a proper currency, and the fact that it's been associated with terrorism, drugs, and pedophilia rings.


Which is why there are lots of you who got in at $800 and are now watching as your money circle the drain as it plummets. Got news for you; bitcoin is fucked. You shills are just too stubborn and desperate to realize that your money is already gone.

You realize that most senators and big banks make their money illegally (as in, those who do) through insider trading right? There's a reason they're called white collar crime. And while I'm sure there are senators, governors, mayors, and CEOs who do have ties to gangs, that is not really their major means of obtaining money. 
Most successful businesses don't get involved with money laundering because they're already--gasp, successful and criminal organizations threaten their business.


Well no, they didn't. But that doesn't mean they murdered, raped, and extorted their way to the top. It was probably built upon the previous foundations of their successful ancestors and with social network connections thanks to their wealth and status, they got richer by encouraging people to help them or by influencing politicians with "donations" to give them laws that favor their business.


You really are a fucking retard, aren't you? You only really profit from war, if you win. All those rich people in Europe? No, sorry--they don't get rich if their country gets bombed to hell and back. 
Now, there are weapons companies that do indeed make a great deal of money off designing and producing weapons. But that isn't surprising considering that you're paying them to make state-of-the-art weapons. 


Except no they don't. The large wealthy CEOs who have any connections to the drug trade save for perhaps being customers, is going to be relatively small. Because the drug trade in all likelyhood threatens their business more than it benefits them and they have no real reason to invest in it. And its illegal nature makes it dangerous to them.


Taxes retard. The US specifically has a massive military budget that is funded from the 300 or so million citizens. From rich to the poor. Only those too poor to have anything to give can be suggested to be innocent of not funding wars or global conflicts. And that is literally because--they have no fucking money!


Lol. No, a very few individuals probably control the massive drug trade on the planet. And most wealthy people aren't interested in starting wars. Perhaps that's a benefit to people who produce weapons, but it's only profitable if their side is winning, which would suggest a small conflict and it's a bit difficult to get a war going, given that it's typically the option when all better options have been exhausted. 
There are lots of reasons that countries go to war with each other--and they are typically for perfectly logical reasons, for the interest of that nation. The "War against Terror" campaigns? A massive backlash after a terrorist attack on US soil. The war in Libya? Came after months of international pressure from all sorts of power on the US and countless atrocities. 
In fact, tell me pothead, how are these rich and powerful people connected to ISIS? I mean, it seems you shitheads have more connections to them then rich people--it even looks as though you've funded them more than these rich and powerful people you're so jealous of.
I mean shit, your bitcoin jesus basically suggested tipping ISIS. Just to prove that no one can stop him from tipping anyone with bitcoin. I mean, it's pretty funny how you scream and kick about how you should be able to do whatever you want with your fucking money, but then point and yell about someone else funding wars and drugs.


In other words, you just explained that why, in addition to the common man not ever wanting bitcoin because it's obscure, overcomplicated, and risky--why the powerful people will never adopt it, including the owners of those massive merchant networks...to prove that bitcoin is inevitable?

But they aren't safer than banks nor are they better. Oh wait, you want to lie and say that it is, and hope that rubes pay your ticket...right, right.


I can purchase plenty of things. Some things cost a great deal due to international shipping, but unless you want to do it illegally, that isn't something you can avoid even with bitcoin. Also, isn't this supposed to be appeal to American culture?
Americans don't give a flying fuck, in general, that you bought your anime from Japan. They're too busy fucking studs.


My girlfriend thinks you have a small penis. And that any "man" dumb enough to fall for this stupid shit is too dumb and insecure.


Someone who needs bitcoin, a car, a gun, a sword, a coat, or whatever to make themselves appear cool is a shallow, worthless, joke of a man. 
But you know all about that, don't you?


Yes, that way all the 20 year old virgin nerds will buy into it, just like they have for all the other "get game" scams.

As another poster elegantly put it, no one believes you got lucky. Financially or sexually.


We need to change that image of a bitcoin owner into something that men who DONT own bitcoin want to emulate.
No you stupid dork. Most men don't want to buy bitcoin because:
1) They're too busy having sex with all the women you never will. There's a line you know.
2) It sounds nerdy, sketchy, and complicated.
3) They already have money.

Well, if you want to buy pot, sure.




No they aren't. They're pretty damn secure, so long as someone doesn't obtain your card or card info. And even then, there are means of possibly countering theft and loss.


That's more an issue with politics and the fact that most people aren't generally expected to make international transfers. And the fact that it can be pretty costly for the people running the business. As technology improves and hopefully, with a greater emphasis by nations and citizens who want to make these transfers, the industry will make it cheaper. 


See, I don't work with scum. I don't buy from scum and I don't sell to scum. And yeah, maybe some piece of shit might find a way to try and screw me by exploiting a weakness. But at least then, I have options. Unlike you poor fucks, who when you get your bitcoins hacked or stolen, the general avenues of response is to either watch your bitcoins get thrown in the wash or to come onto r/bitcoin and see several dozen "sorry for your loss" posts. 


Not really. You see, morse code is actually functional. Bitcoin however, is a shitty excuse for a currency that has turned itself into a natural pyramid scheme for dorks in their mother's basements. 
Seriously, come to me when you can use bitcoins--not middlemen or gift cards impart paid through by stolen credit cards--to actually buy something from places like Amazon, Toys R' Us, Staples, Target, Joann Fabric, Applebees, Pizza Hut, Jiffy Lube, or anyone like that.

Perhaps, but Ross didn't even have to convince Dratel. If Ross wishes to maintain innocence in all things, then he has that right and there isn't much that Dratel can do, but go with it.
It also wouldn't surprise me. Ross probably thought that the authorities could track his bitcoins. As we know, most bitcoiners think that bitcoin is anonymous, when it's actually pseudo-anonymous. Dratel may have even of accepted that explanation.
The idea the defense may have had, might be that if Ross owned up to having legal interest, it might turn out that it was a trap and the FBI had a legal means of seizing and searching the server. If the defense was sure that they couldn't otherwise prove a connection, then they would have been fine.
Unfortunately, the prosecution was able to effortlessly prove just about everything. I think this goes back to what the judge said to the defense; they played a risky game and they got burned.

Ask yourself. If the whole point of getting into bitcoins is to get filthy rich, then why is it a supposed currency? Currency is about being able to trade it. If the value is only going to go up up up, then no one will ever give it away (sans cashing out) because it's always better to keep it.
And if you can see this, why wouldn't anyone else? A lot of bitcoin fanatics like to think they're special or clever--and perhaps they are in certain areas of computer science.  But that does not make them experts in all things. They are not more competent than the Average Joe, just because they know a lot about computers. 
You get the same with medical doctors, where several of them are so far up their own ass that they think they know more than say, a grease monkey mechanic because they have a doctorate. 
So if everyone in this new investment doesn't want to trade bitcoin and bitcoin has no use (it's literally just data bits) of its own other to be traded, then what you've got is a bunch of people trying to swindle each other out of the apparent value, then cash out and leave everyone else with the worthless "currency".
This has pretty much already happened. These "early adopters" here are not early adopters. They've all but cashed out. It's too late to really make a fortunate or lots of money, unless you find some, steal some, or otherwise come into them cheap.
You should not invest in bitcoin. You should, if you believe you want to invest serious money, got to a professional, who has actual experience, actual expertise in the subject matter and ultimately, someone who at the end of the day, is actually responsible to fix the problem if things start going sour--because they are obligated to help you.
Not someone who just handed you advice on the internet and at best shrugs and feels sorry for you or laughs in your face for investing so much (which is often the case around here).

Let me tell you what 220090 is trying to tell you. He's in this deep. He bought in at $800 and he needs that price to go up. If coinbase goes legit, that means his holdings might someday (or so he has convinced himself) climb back up to $800 or even higher!
He doesn't give a flying fuck about your privacy or your beliefs. He just wants to break even. And he's willing to fuck over the entire concept of bitcoin to do it.

Well of course they're safe from being stolen.
But then again, so his the shit I drop in a toilet. No one wants those, save for a small number of creeps who think they can sell it for millions.

Yeah dude, I was here since fall. Dumbasses like you have been saying that for MONTHS. MONTHS. First it was 400 was the bottom. Then it was 300, it had to be 300 and couldn't possibly drop any lower. Then in the past two months it dropped below 300 and even below 200, before a massive pump bounced it back near 300 and it has been struggling in the mid 200s ever since and looks to be ready for another drop.
You clearly don't fucking understand how this shit works. I barely understand how it works and I wouldn't be dumb enough to invest in big boy stock without actual experts telling me what to do. You want to know where bitcoin is heading? Look at its chart.
The ENTIRE fucking chart.
It's on a downard spiral. It has been since it peaked in the winter of last year. And instead of going after the people who robbed you, you treat them like champions of liberty and captains of industry, instead of the unethical, robbing shittards they really are.

What about them? Just because you make it easier for me to buy them, doesn't suddenly make them better. It's as sensible as suggesting I buy a square wheel because now they're more accessible. That's great if I actually want it. 
You have to address the core failings with bitcoin. It's volatile and it only makes sense to buy it if you want to make money off of it, therefore making it unsustainable because it becomes a tool to rip others off. You're either a predator or prey. And you can switch between the two in an instant.
As for ATMs, most of the ones that have been produced are cheap remodels of older ATMs with cheap hardware and software slapped on, causing either one or more of the security measures to fail or just the entire thing failing entirely. 
As for this bullshit of self-automated factories and stores--what a load of crap. First off, we already have a means of transmitting wealth; that is our current system. Second, self-automation like that is probably decades, if not centuries away.

You so realize that the bird, if it had left, would have starved to death or be eaten by predators, as it didn't obtain the skills it needed to survive in the wild? You know, like you retards? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:28:04
Yeah, you're right. 
You are a fucking idiot.
First you bought bitcoin and then you were too arrogant to think that anyone would scam a big haul like you. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:43:27
I'm pretty fucking sure people said this when it was at $300.

Then you give it to a reputable charity. They take credit cards and you'll be helping people in a more efficient manner, rather than giving them fifty bucks they might just blow through because they have no idea how to operate money beyond simple spend and save concepts. And the charity might actually be able to help elevate them from poverty, rather than just giving them a few more days to live.
You know, the difference between giving a man a fish and teaching him to fish.
But we all know you don't actually give a shit about poor people, so stop shilling.

No he isn't.

But I don't understand. Bitcoin is a useless pyramid scheme and Satoshi is some nerd on the internet. Why would anyone elect him? He probably even wouldn't collect.

What's there to talk about? Your idea is impractical, been spouted for months, and is really just a shameless attempt to raise interest in bitcoin. 


So why would a homeless man want bitcoins, when the value of bitcoins fluctuates so often?


You really are a few Pika's short of a Poke'mon, aren't you? Let me break it down for you son.
1) Sending bitcoin remotely to a homeless man is probably more or less going to be you just helping some random somebody. Therefore, there is no appreciable difference in this aspect, between a charity and what bitcoin MIGHT offer. 
2) In addition to the problem above, if you are trying to give someone money in person, bitcoin is less convenient than cash and its volatility means that the bum will never be sure how much cash he will have at any given time, without checking it and constantly worrying if it's going to go up or down. More so, the bum is most likely to just cash out the moment he sees it go up, since that way he makes more money,
3) The bum is going to have a hard time using bitcoins because bitcoins are not generally accepted in many places. Only a few remote areas accept it. And that information may be very difficult or expensive for the bum to track down, if he does not have access to the internet for whatever reason.
4) When you look at a charity overall, they can make sure that the money is spent more wisely, even if it isn't as efficient or geared where some people prefer. A charity can have more purchasing power, has more corporate friends, and has more resources, because it is centralized and has networked to other charities and groups that are interested in helping. 


And? That doesn't save you from scrutiny. You blowhards constantly try and mask your unrelenting greed with pretty flowers and words. 


Still upset that your money is circling the drain?
Offer your bitterness to the Lady, for she finds it sweet.

Somehow, I don't think Liam Neeson want's anything to do with nerd/drug internet play money.

Okay...so you gonna address why no one wants bitcoins?
