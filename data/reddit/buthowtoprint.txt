No, she isn't - her dad is gambling money that she earned on a wildly speculative investment vehicle masquerading as currency because it's what he wants to do with what he views as his $600.  She doesn't have a fucking clue what's going on other than that her dad says he's doing the best thing he can with her money.
A responsible parent (and I say this as a father of two myself) should be putting this money into a long term, safe savings vehicle to have available *for her to decide what to do with on her own once she's old enough.*

Crypto is not savings, it's a wildly volatile investment.  If she understands crypto the way she understands normal money, then she does not understand crypto.  It's clear that you don't either.

In what world?  It is *nowhere near becoming the norm.*  I have two young children, ages 9 and 4.  They both have savings accounts, with a savings book that they understand - they don't need to keep track of how much their fractional values are worth in *actual, spendable* currency all the time.  They both know that they can take $1 of their spending money, go to the corner store, and buy a slushie with it - something they can't do with crypto, and won't be able to do for a long, long time, if ever.  Why?  Because why would a gas station bother?

No, you won't.  Not going to happen, nor should it happen.

I think the point is that *there are no candy stores, toy stores, any store a six year old would be interested in* (statistically speaking) that she could spend this "pocket money."
