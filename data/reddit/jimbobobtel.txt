I've upped it to once every 60 minutes. That ought to do for an estimation tool :-)

So you're suggesting some bad actor might MITM next to the IP address of my server in order to gather the (likely dynamic) IP addresses of people idly wondering what the MtGox coins might ultimately pay out in order to then ... ?

Do you mean me? Or do you mean the people that might visit my calculator? I'm not collecting IPs or email addresses - it's just an easy calculator for people. Not everyone on the internet is a bad person!

,,and now all fixed. Thanks again!

Thanks for the feedback - can't believe not one but two bugs somehow crept in between dev and live. I'll get it fixed tonight.

Once every 24 hours. The exact time depends on when the first person visits the page more than 24 hours since the rates were last grabbed.

The numbers are based upon the estimates of the MtGox Legal people, who seem to be the most clued in when it comes to this whole fustercluck we find ourselves in. I'm not declaring values - I'm just offering a calculator I built for myself for other people to use if they want to.

Everyone with MtGox coins did!

You're welcome. Glad you like it :-)

Actually I consider myself more privacy aware than most. I'm still interested to know what you think a bad actor would do with a list of IP addresses of people that have visited my calculator?
