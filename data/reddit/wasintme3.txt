That seems like a very simple explanation for separating validation and mining, perhaps you don't understand it?

21 Inc may be on the right track with IoT devices with embedded mining chips. 
If every cable box and router had an ASIC then you would return to decentralization very quickly.

You could point them all to a p2pool like decentralized network of miners, hell even use lightning to allow for micropayments to the miners...
As long as you don't do something completely asinine like separating validation from mining with "open hash" then everything should remain decentralized and fair.

By all means, please explain Open Hash to me in a way that does not destroy the security of the network.

Apparently so. Wouldn't it be nice if folks could take off their "I've chosen this side till death" armor and actually face the facts that blocks are full and that a hard cap increase is inevitable if Bitcoin is to continue to grow.
The sad thing is that all these folks so vehemently fighting against a hard cap increase will have to accept one eventually or they will find they are unable to open a channel on their off chain savior due to limited capacity

Yea, you figured it out, it was Gavin's actions that made Satoshi decide it was time to graciously step aside, dam that Gavin, he stole Satoshi from us /s

Holy crap! A developer met with miners to share his concerns, break out the torches and pitchforks!
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:47:27
If you knew your Bitcoin history you would know that was the last time anyone ever heard from Satoshi, not just Gavin. So he did not just "break off contact" with Gavin, but with the Bitcoin universe...

You don't mine on the device, you mine to a pool (hopefully of the users choice)...

Weird, as your patronizing child (supporting your trolling here, I know I should not), I (and most others in community) always thought it was the CIAs interest in Bitcoin, and not Gavin's willingness to try and explain it, that caused Satoshi to go underground... Something about "we have kicked the hornets nest..."

We can, just convince the miners that blockstreams corporate interests do not align with their own and they are being boondoggled by a group of egotistical control freaks who are so entrenched in their own success that they forgot what brought them to bitcoin in the first place.

because reasons?

My 2 transactions were visible in my online account within a couple minutes, entered the amounts in coinbase and was verified.

This, for 2 huge reasons:
1. Any crypto currency kept on an exchange is value you are trusting to a third party. It is subject to loss completely outside of your control. Unless you are an active trader there is no good reason to trust any third party with your value in crypto.
2. This is an altcoin post that has been curated and allowed by the moderators here. There are no altcoin posts allowed on Unfortunatly it seems an unwritten exception has been adopted that only allows posts that depict altcoin a in a negative light.
