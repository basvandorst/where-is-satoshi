Have you done this?

It's relevant news from an individual that was massively bullish, there are people here who will have stupidly gone purely off what he said, its worth letting them know of his decision change.

IF bitcoin's value does endlessly drop, I'll enjoy reading this.

How am I misquoting him, this is from bloomberg?

How has it made the price drop so dramatically though in the space of a few hours? Seems pretty bullshit that news such as this can have such a DRAMATIC effect.

Maybe in the USA, but no where near as much in the UK.

This is a silly point you're trying to make... You may as well say, why invest in anything at all.
You invest to grow your money, you accept risks and rewards for doing so.
A lot of people here seem to think that Bitcoins value will always continually go up, if that was the case, why doesn't everyone just buy because its guaranteed?
It's no guaranteed, thats the point I'm making, there no reason why it can't drop to &lt; $10,000 tomorrow and never rise above that again, it also could rise to $1,000,000 in the next few months and never drop again, no one knows.
Risk what you are willing to lose.

I'm just pissed off I bought at €16000... managed to buy again at €13800 but its sitting at around €12850 at the moment..
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:44:36
I'm aware of that, but theres no guarantee that it will continue upwards, past/historical performance does not guarantee future performance.

Was this actually safe? Do they use an escrow or something?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:55:33
Ye, it's given me a slap on the hand, learnt what I needed to learn, I believe the price will go up and will continue to do so, but I'm more reasonably invested.

For bitcoiners that do not know, this is what we commonly refer to as (here in the UK), as a remoaner.

What about mobile wallets like blockchain.info?

Is the FED meeting tomorrow likely to have any effect on bitcoin? e.g. expected announcements that are of any interest?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:14:24
interested in finding this out too
