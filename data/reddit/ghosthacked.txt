Statist gonna state.

Why does it seem everyone is bitching about fees?
Block limit aside. Hasn't transaction fees always been an essential concept to bitcoins longevity? When the block reward stops being profitable, miners will impose fees to make money. I'm no bitcoin expert, but this seems like bitcoin 101 stuff.
Did people just think that fees would never be relevant anytime soon?

Ah, I get the impression that they are solving blocks at a rate disproportionate to their hashing power? Or am I way off.

Ah, is that the point of change addresses? The change is 'ideally' sent to public address who's private keys are 'secure'?

So, how am I supposed to spend my bitcoins if I don't want my private keys on a computer connected to the internet?
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:49:27
I'm already guaranteed to be able to use it.

Came here for the 1984 add. Only slightly disappointed.
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:47:46
Thank you for the reply. I had yet to understand the whole 'air gap' thing, for a system that needs to be connected to the internet to work. 
Wouldn't typing in a private key to sign a transaction defeat the purpose of the air gap then?
Also, I've read about the trezor and seems like a great system. As common as smartphones are, (I have accumulated several spares over the years) is there a similar software only solution? IE a 'trezor' app you install on and air gap'd smart phone?
Thanks again!

So I've read all the comments here, is there a possible ELI5 here?
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:59:16
"I do not consent to any searches officer."
"Am I being arrested or detained?"
"Am I free to go?"
Usually in that order.
May require several repetitions.
You may actually get arrested. At which point. Shut the fuck up and go peacefully.
Lawyer up.

Lots of good advice here already. I'd say never more than you can afford to lose. If it really is an investment and not just a quick cash grab, start low. You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin at a time. Budget for a specific periodic amount and use coinbases autobuy and make sure you don't 'miss' that cash. The exchange rates for Bitcoin are volitile and I see no reason that would change much in the near future. In the long run, it should be come less volitile as its use broadens. Buying large sums at the end or during rallies is will likely result in disappointment after things settle down. That doesn't mean don't buy. But you should expect that the exchange rates to go down at some point. Just hodl and enjoy the ride. 
There are concerns about doing business with coinbase, and they are not unfounded. You should read up about their policies and their recent encounter with the IRS. The reality is with any company that holds you keys for you, they are not your coins.
How ever you obtain Bitcoin, never keep significant amounts in wallets/exchanges you do not have sole control ofnthe private keys.
Have a cold storage solution ready. There are many ways to do this, no single one is clearly better than the other IMO. Personally I like the idea of the hardware wallets like the trezor or ledger. It keeps private keys offline and makes signing transactions easy. 
Some wallets support offline transaction signing. You could use an old smart phone as your offline hardware wallet. Makes sure the wifi and data are off. Some people have gone as far to remove the wireless chips from old phones for this exact purpose.
If you start small, you won't feel the need to do tons of research all at once to properly protect a big investment. But eventually you have many more BTC, and then the next rally you may find the 2 or 3 k fiat worth of bitcoin you bought is worth several times that. Suddenly the need to properly secure that value becomes much more apparent. Buying small and steady gives you more time to read and understand.
Good luck!

Is there an eli5 as to what method is being used to make this?
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:07:53
Could I get a brief eli5 why this is or isn't accurate? Thanks :)

Thank you. Is this a function of specific wallets, or should the same idea work with any hd wallet?

So segwit nodes retain the tx signature data, legacy nodes would never see it in the first place?
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:38:26
So it does. :D
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:11:25
Well if you sell now then you definitely loose. 
Do you need the cash now? Then you should sell, and not buy BTC with money you cannot afford to loose.
Do you not need the money and are just worried about it going lower? Hold, Have a pint, and wait for this whole thing to blow over.

Read about mal-ware that installed CPU mining software. Read a little about Bitcoin at that point, but didn't re
Really get the big deal till much later. Didn't buy untill after the 2013 rally.

What is segwit2x ? 
I haven't been able to find an actual explanation that isn't just saying it's a scam or some power move by bitmain. If it is only these things, how is it a scam/power move?
