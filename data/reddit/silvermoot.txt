I'd use it like I use Paypal. Yea, I want no part of Paypal, but there are still some &gt; $30 dollar items on Ebay where Paypal is the only way to pay. So I pay with my credit card directly into Paypal and don't carry a balance. I also closed the bank account that was one time associated with the account, so they can't do a direct debit against it.
If MintChip wants to me to think that they are secure, they'll have to open their security up to peer review. Right now I have no confidence that they're not just using "security through obscurity".

At that exchange rate, a series of tubes seem surprisingly cheap. How much for a big truck?

That's why this was a karma-free self-post, or at the *very least* he placed the first comment on the thread that details his case that this is a valid link to post in this subreddit. If that very early comment actually contained any content worth reading, we all would have upvoted it by now instead of it being buried under the shear volume of 4 total posts, such that you actually have to dig for it. (or something like that)

From the linked article:


I'm looking at a Google cache of the [rules]( currently dated Sep 12, 2012 09:32:43 GMT, and there is no mention of any "popular choice award". Does anyone have an snapshot of an earlier version?
Rule 6 has a section 10 that says:


which gives them a legal "out", though not a moral one. 
Changing the actual rules during the contest, however, is just plain dirty tricks.

just a horrible analogy then.

Is there a snapshot of the rules before the change?

Wow, this reporter really knows a lot! Where do they find so many well-educated fact-checking people to write this stuff?

While I'm sure the difficulty will double, what made you think that the value of bitcoin will **halve** with near certainly? That's what I had issue with on your opening paragraph. A quick search-fu due diligence shows that bitcoin has changed in value significantly, but I can't find any evidence that due to the difficulty level getting harder, historic bitcoin prices have halved.

Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2012-11-26 21:51:55
,  , maybe, but I don't see how this related to Bitcoins.
Mind you, I'm not complaining. It's a good story, and if you xpost I'll get to see it again.
@_date: 2012-11-26 15:11:41
I would agree. Mining for ($ASSET) will suddenly get twice as hard with the same equipment with near 100% certainly, the exact moment which would be hard to predict. The **value** of ($ASSET) may or may not change. 
I don't think the value of bitcoins will **halve** overnight, and I'll be honest and say I don't know if the change in difficulty level ever had an obviously correlation with the price of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2012-11-26 15:21:09
Do you really expect the price of bitcoin to halve when mining becomes twice as hard? Any historical precedence for this?

Fjordo&gt;...well written analogy...
Well first off, I'm a noob in the bitcoin world and I'm not a professional writer. I know I've been pretty harsh on the guy, but I also know he needs an attention grabbing first paragraph. 
original paragraph:


I could say:


But that has issues too. The *yield* of bitcoin mining halved, but not the *difficulty* (which stays the same, setting up a mining rig does not get any harder) and not exactly the *cost* either. Electricity remains about the same price, and that is a major factor in the cost of bitcoin mining. 


Catchy opening paragraph, no? I don't even know if there are "bitcoin mining futures", like there are gold mining futures. From my understanding, (I have no *BS*, no *More Same*, and no *Piled Higher and Deeper*), these instruments allow the gold mining companies to offer people the chance to buy and sell gold before it's even been extracted from the ground! (I'd rather stack the physical, myself). Would I short GPU manufacturer stock? I don't know if any are public companies, and I've found the fact that AWS offers several instances with virtual GPUs somewhat interesting. Are any of the graphic card manufactures dumping money into developing better number crunching cards? As bitcoin gives an actual monetary reward to calculating with computer hardware (as opposed to "folding @ home" or SETI ), are we on the verge of a new supercomputing Renaissance? 
One thing I do know, is that I'd be extremely cautious implying that because of the upcoming bitcoin difficulty increase, the value of Bitcoins would halve. If anything, they would become more dear as Bitcoin gets more widely adopted and Bitcoin "mining" becomes more expensive. 
We're not going to see, IMHO,  Bitcoin monetary inflation but rather *deflation*. Bitcoins held now will buy you more stuff if held longer. Normal deflationary effects (reluctance to spend now because by holding you get more for your money) will be tempered to an unknown extend based on all the people new to Bitcoin, where this type of currency fulfills an actual need. 
So basically I'd not rework the paragraph, instead I'd ditch it entirely. Exactly what I'd write, I don't know off hand. I've already written a wall of text. 
I do know that I'm unlikely to exchange much more of my free time to rewrite his article in the hope that the exchange earns me more worthless internet points.
TL;DR - it sucks, also *deflation* not *inflation.*

It's maybe a bit premature, but I think the *Streisand Effect*, is a valid comparison.  Erik Voorhees is saying because MintChip tried to suppress the idea of buying Bitcoins with MintChip, word about their little "contest" will spread farther and wider than it would otherwise. Indeed, this is the first I've ever heard of MintChip myself.
